3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 10-553, Hosanna-Tabor 

Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. The Equal 

6 Employment Opportunity Commission. 

7  Mr. Laycock. 

8  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS LAYCOCK 

9  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. LAYCOCK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

11 please the Court: 

12  The churches do not set the criteria for 

13 selecting or removing the officers of government, and 

14 government does not set the criteria for selecting or 

removing officers of the church. That's a bedrock 

16 principle, and these Respondents would repudiate it. 

17 They no longer seriously argue that Cheryl Perich was 

18 not a minister. Instead, they argue that even people 

19 who are indisputably ministers can sue their churches on 

claims that turn on their qualifications, their job 

21 performance, and the rules of ministry. They would --

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Laycock, would you 

23 clarify one point? You say the church decides who's 

24 qualified to be a minister, but, as I understand the 

facts here, she was never decommissioned as a minister, 

3

1 and, beyond that, she was even recommended by the
 

2 officials to other parishes to be a commissioned
 

3 minister. So, it's -- it's odd to say there's any
 

4 interferences with who is qualified to be a minister,
 

because the church was holding her out as being 

6 qualified. 

7  MR. LAYCOCK: Well, she was removed from her 

8 ministry at Hosanna-Tabor. They do not have to indulge 

9 in a vendetta against her and file charges with the 

synod. And if you look at that recommendation -- it's 

11 in the joint appendix -- it is not much of a 

12 recommendation. There's excellent, commendable, 

13 proficient, and in ministry qualities, she gets 

14 proficient. We all know if there's a 5, a 4, and a 3, a 

3 isn't very good. 

16  So, they were not recommending her; they 

17 simply weren't pursuing formal charges against her 

18 before the -- before the Missouri Synod. And -- and the 

19 problems they had were most severe at Hosanna-Tabor. In 

another congregation that didn't know this history, she 

21 might have been able to be effective again. That was 

22 for them to decide. They make their own calls. 

23  But she was removed at Hosanna-Tabor, which 

24 was where the problem was.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, most of the

Official 

1 circuits have recognized a ministerial exception. But 

2 they've, in one form or another, created a pretext 

3 exception. The reason for that is the situation that 

4 troubles me. How about a teacher who reports sexual 

abuse to the government and is fired because of that 

6 reporting? 

7  Now, we know from the news recently that 

8 there was a church whose religious beliefs centered 

9 around sexually exploiting women and, I believe, 

children. Regardless of whether it's a religious belief 

11 or not, doesn't society have a right at some point to 

12 say certain conduct is unacceptable, even if religious 

13 -- smoking peyote? And once we say that's unacceptable, 

14 can and why shouldn't we protect the people who are 

doing what the law requires, i.e., reporting it? 

16  So, how do we deal with that situation under 

17 your theory? Under your theory, nothing survives if the 

18 individual is a minister, no claim, private claim. 

19  MR. LAYCOCK: I think if you look at the 

court of appeals cases, they have not indulged in 

21 pretext inquiries for ministers. The case you present 

22 is obviously a difficult case, and I would say two 

23 things: We think the appropriate rule should be the 

24 government could do many things to force reporting, to 

penalize people who don't report, but a discharge claim

1 by a minister presents the question why she was 

2 discharged, and the court should stay out of that. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem with that is 

4 that it doesn't take account of the societal interest in 

encouraging the reporting. And, in fact, if we -- if we 

6 define the ministerial exception in the way you want, we 

7 take away the incentive for reporting; we actually do 

8 the opposite of what society needs. 

9  MR. LAYCOCK: I understand that concern, and 

that was my second point, that if you want to carve out 

11 an exception for cases like child abuse where the 

12 government's interest is in protecting the child, not an 

13 interest in protecting the minister, when you get such a 

14 case, we think you could carve out that exception.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How? Give me a 

16 theoretical framework for this. 

17  MR. LAYCOCK: The -- first you have to 

18 identify the government's interest in regulation. If 

19 the government's interest is in protecting ministers 

from discrimination, we are squarely within the heart of 

21 the ministerial exception. 

22  If the government's interest is something 

23 quite different from that, like protecting the children, 

24 then you can assess whether that government interest is 

sufficiently compelling to justify interfering with the 

6

1 relationship between the church and its ministers. But 

2 the government's interest is at its nadir when the claim 

3 is: We want to protect these ministers as such. We 

4 want to tell the churches what criteria they should 

apply for -- for selecting and removing ministers. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Laycock, the ministerial 

7 exception is not something new. It has been widely 

8 recognized, as Justice Sotomayor mentioned, by the 

9 courts of appeals going back 40 years. So, we can see 

how the recognition of this exception within -- with 

11 certain contours has worked out. And how has it worked 

12 out over those past 40 years? Have there been a great 

13 many cases, a significant number of cases, involving the 

14 kinds of things that Justice Sotomayor is certainly 

rightly concerned about, instances in which ministers 

16 have been fired for reporting criminal violations and 

17 that sort of thing? 

18  MR. LAYCOCK: The only -- I'm not aware of 

19 any such case. The one case I am aware of cuts the 

other way. A minister, a priest accused of sexually 

21 abusing children who was fired, sued to get his job 

22 back, and the church invoked the ministerial exception, 

23 and that case ended. They were able to get rid of him. 

24  There is a cert petition pending in which a 

teacher with a long series of problems in her school 

7

25

Official 

1 called the police about an allegation of sexual abuse 

2 that did not happen at the school, did not involve a 

3 student of the school, did not involve a parent at the 

4 school, someplace else; and -- and called the police and 

had them come interview a student without any 

6 communication with -- with her principal. And the 

7 respondents tried to spin that as a case of discharge 

8 for reporting sexual abuse. But if you look at the 

9 facts, it's really quite different. And those are the 

only two cases I'm aware of that even approach touching 

11 on this problem. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But here what we have is a 

13 claim of retaliation, so that she can't even get a 

14 hearing. So, we can look at the various tests that are 

proposed here, and I think it's difficult to formulate 

16 the tests, but this can't even be -- be litigated 

17 because she is discharged. The allegation is that 

18 there's a retaliation for even asking for a hearing 

19 where these tests could -- could be applied.

 MR. LAYCOCK: Well, she can't get a hearing 

21 in civil court. She could have had a hearing in the 

22 synod before decisionmakers who would have been 

23 independent of the local church. This Court has 

24 repeatedly said churches can create tribunals for the 

governance of their officers. The churches --

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Again, that -- that could 

2 be an argument you could make in the -- in the pretext 

3 hearing. 

4  MR. LAYCOCK: Well, it's an argument we make 

in the hearing on whether the ministerial exception 

6 applies. You know --

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're asking for an 

8 exemption so these issues can't even be tried. 

9  MR. LAYCOCK: Well, we're asking to apply 

the exemption --

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's almost like a summary 

12 -- like a summary judgment argument. 

13  MR. LAYCOCK: It was precisely a motion 

14 for --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's the -- that's 

16 the analogy, I think. 

17  MR. LAYCOCK: It was a motion for summary 

18 judgment. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, no. What she is 

saying is that you basically gave me summary judgment; 

21 you didn't allow me to go to the agency to have a proper 

22 test applied. The summary judgment was just an analogy. 

23 Forget it. 

24  (Laughter.)

 MR. LAYCOCK: I'm not entirely sure I

Official 

1 understand the question. We agree she couldn't go to 

2 civil court if she's a minister. She could have gone to 

3 the synod. She wasn't cut off from that. She decided 

4 not to do it.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm saying if there 

6 are some substantial interests the church has that can 

7 be litigated in EEOC hearing. She was fired simply for 

8 asking for a hearing. 

9  MR. LAYCOCK: I understand that. But once 

you start to litigate these cases --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: I think your point is that 

12 it's -- it's none of the business of the government to 

13 decide what the substantial interest of the church is. 

14  MR. LAYCOCK: That's one of my points, maybe 

the most important of my points. These -- these 

16 decisions are committed to the churches by separation of 

17 church and state, but -- but beyond that, once the --

18 this process of trying to identify, we can decide some 

19 issues in this case and we won't get to other issues in 

this case doesn't work. As Justice Breyer said in a 

21 First Circuit opinion, that requires more and more 

22 finely spun distinctions that create entanglement rather 

23 than avoid it, Universidad de Bayamon. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you 

referred to the ministerial exception, but, of course, 

10

25

Official 

1 your position extends beyond ministers. How do we --

2 how do we decide who's covered by the ministerial 

3 exception and who is not? 

4  MR. LAYCOCK: Right. Here I think it's very 

easy. She's a commissioned minister in the church. She 

6 holds ecclesiastical office. She teaches the religion 

7 class. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's say it's 

9 a teacher who teaches only purely secular subjects but 

leads the class in grace before lunch. Is that somebody 

11 who would be covered by the ministerial exception? 

12  MR. LAYCOCK: The lower courts have said 

13 that person is not covered. And we are not challenging 

14 that rule. Obviously, there has to be some kind of 

quantitative threshold. There will be line-drawing 

16 problems. But --

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought your 

18 position would be if she's a commissioned minister, as 

19 distinguished from a teacher who conducts grace or takes 

the class to chapel. I'm -- I take it the Chief is 

21 asking for somebody in this -- that you categorize as a 

22 minister, although mostly she's a math teacher. You 

23 would say the extent of her religious duties don't 

24 matter; what counts is that she is commissioned as a 

minister.

Official 

1  MR. LAYCOCK: If she's commissioned as a 

2 minister and if that is not a sham, then we think that 

3 makes her a minister. If you have a Jesuit teaching 

4 physics, we think he is still a priest. And he's still 

controlled by the ministerial exception. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Can we try whether it's a 

7 sham? I thought you said we couldn't try whether it's a 

8 sham. 

9  MR. LAYCOCK: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is a sham different from a 

11 pretext? 

12  (Laughter.) 

13  MR. LAYCOCK: Well, I -- I certainly meant 

14 something different from a pretext. A sham is more 

extreme, and it goes to a different point in the 

16 analysis. You can decide whether she's really a 

17 minister. That's the threshold question that courts 

18 must decide. And if we have a person with a ministerial 

19 title who is doing nothing at all religious or 

ministerial, we have a church that tries to say everyone 

21 who ever worked for us or ever may is a minister, the 

22 courts can deal with those cases if they --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you would allow the --

24 the government courts to probe behind the church's 

assertion that this person is a minister? You would 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 allow that, right? But once it is determined that the 

2 person is a minister, you would not allow the government 

3 to decide whether the firing was a pretext? 

4  MR. LAYCOCK: That's right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, different 

6 churches have different ideas about who's a minister. 

7 There are some churches who think all of our adherents 

8 are ministers of our faith. Now, does that mean that 

9 everybody who's a member of that church qualifies as a 

minister because that is part of the church's belief? 

11  MR. LAYCOCK: I don't -- I don't think it 

12 means that. And, again, I -- I think courts have some 

13 capacity to look at what this employee is actually 

14 doing, and if he's not performing any of the functions 

of a religious leader, if he's not teaching the faith, 

16 then --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Every one of our 

18 adherents stands as a witness to our beliefs. And 

19 that -- you know, not every church is hierarchical in 

terms of different offices. 

21  MR. LAYCOCK: I understand that. And lay 

22 people in many churches are expected to be witnesses, 

23 right. So --

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Lay people in many --

MR. LAYCOCK: Lay people have to be 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 witnesses. The fact that you're expected to witness to 

2 the faith when the occasion arises doesn't make you --

3 doesn't make you a minister. 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the answer you gave to 

the Chief Justice seems to me to be this case. I was 

6 interested. I didn't know about this -- this minister 

7 capacity in this particular church. And as the Chief 

8 Justice indicates, many churches don't have -- some 

9 churches don't have what we think of as professional or 

full-time ministers at all. They're all ministers. 

11  MR. LAYCOCK: Right. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you said, well, that 

13 -- that can be litigated, that can be investigated. And 

14 I suppose when we do that we say, how many secular 

functions do you perform? And that's what this case is. 

16 But you don't -- you don't even want that issue to be 

17 tried. You say that issue can't even be explored. 

18  MR. LAYCOCK: How -- you know, how many 

19 religious functions you perform can be explored. The 

issue that can be explored is whether she's a minister. 

21 We think she clearly is. The issue --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: And that term is a legal 

23 term. What constitutes a minister is -- is decided by 

24 the law, not by the church, right?

 MR. LAYCOCK: That is correct.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

2  MR. LAYCOCK: That is correct. 

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: Is that correct? 

4  JUSTICE ALITO: But I thought with a lot of 

deference to the church's understanding of whether 

6 someone is a minister. 

7  MR. LAYCOCK: We think there should be 

8 deference to good-faith understandings, but we are not 

9 arguing for a rule that would enable an organization to 

fraudulently declare that everyone is a minister when 

11 it's not true. You decided the Tony Alamo case 20 years 

12 ago. We're not defending that. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: What makes it not true? 

14 What is the legal definition of "minister"? What is it? 

That you have to lead the congregation in their 

16 religious services or what? What is it? 

17  MR. LAYCOCK: We think -- we think you -- if 

18 you teach the doctrines of the faith, if that is part of 

19 your job responsibilities, to teach the doctrines of the 

faith, we think you're a minister. 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, does that mean that 

22 any religious teacher is a minister under your theory? 

23 So, you know, there may be teachers in religious schools 

24 who teach religious subjects, not mathematics, but are 

not ordained or commissioned in any way as ministers. 

15

1 Are they ministers? 

2  MR. LAYCOCK: If you're ordained or 

3 commissioned, that makes it very easy. If you teach the 

4 religion class, you teach an entire class on religion, 

we think you ought to be within this rule. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that it was 

7 part of -- it was agreed that there was no fact dispute 

8 that what she did, her duties at the school, did not 

9 change from when she was a contract teacher, and 

therefore not a minister, and then she takes courses and 

11 is qualified to become a minister, but what she's doing 

12 at the school is the very same thing. And I thought 

13 that was the basis for the -- the decision that we're 

14 reviewing, that there was no difference at all in what 

she did before she was commissioned and after she was 

16 commissioned. 

17  MR. LAYCOCK: That -- that's what the Sixth 

18 Circuit said. What they -- what -- you know, I don't 

19 think that changes the nature of the functions that were 

being performed. But what's relevant to that, that they 

21 neglected was these noncommissioned -- these teachers 

22 who were not commissioned ministers, the lay and 

23 contract teachers, were fill-ins only when no called 

24 teacher was available, and Perich identifies only one 

person for 1 year.

Official 

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're isolating one 

2 parish, but there was something in one of these briefs 

3 that said the majority of the teachers in the Lutheran 

4 schools -- let's see where it was. I think it was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: While Justice Ginsburg is 

6 looking, I had -- I had the same impression, that 

7 whether you're commissioned or not commissioned doesn't 

8 necessarily mean you can't teach a religious class. 

9  MR. LAYCOCK: Well, it doesn't --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And again, that's 

11 something that -- that can be heard. You don't even 

12 want to hear it. 

13  MR. LAYCOCK: That's -- it is not uncommon, 

14 even with ordained ministers, it's not uncommon among 

Protestants, to recognize an ordination from a different 

16 denomination that has similar teachings. So, when --

17 when they can't find a called minister to cover a class 

18 and they hire another Christian from another 

19 conservative Protestant denomination, they say: While 

you teach here, you're required to teach Lutheran 

21 doctrine. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Going back 

23 to the question Justice Kagan asked you, if one of these 

24 Protestant teachers that's not Lutheran led the 

cafeteria prayer, as they are required to, you're now

1 saying that the law must recognize that lay teacher as a 

2 minister and apply the ministerial exception, even 

3 though the religion doesn't consider her a minister? 

4  MR. LAYCOCK: I -- I didn't say that. I 

said --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that was the 

7 answer you gave. If she taught a religious class --

8  MR. LAYCOCK: If she teaches a religion 

9 class, not if she merely leads a prayer.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what is your 

11 definition of "minister"? Maybe we need to find out. 

12 So, it's not a title. It's really -- the only 

13 function -- you're saying anyone who teaches religion? 

14  MR. LAYCOCK: I think if you teach the 

religion class, you're clearly a minister. But if you 

16 are -- if you hold an ecclesiastical office, that makes 

17 this a very easy --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but this is -- you're 

19 saying a fortiori, but basically you'd be here anyway 

even if she hadn't been ordained; right? 

21  MR. LAYCOCK: That's correct. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: What is your take -- what 

24 is your reaction to a less dramatic kind of holding? 

Suppose we were to say the truth is that the particular 

18

25

Official 

1 individual here does have some religious obligations in 

2 teaching and quite a lot that aren't. So, she's sort of 

3 on the edge. At the same time, there is a statute 

4 which, whether it applies or not, you could take the 

principle, and it says a religious organization like
 

6 your client may require that she conform to the
 

7 religious tenets of the organization.
 

8  So, Congress focused on this. And the
 

9 district court looks at it, and suppose it were to
 

decide: That's true, but there's no evidence here at 

11 all that religious tenets had anything to do with her 

12 being dismissed. No one mentioned them. She didn't 

13 know about them. I didn't until I read the very 

14 excellent brief filed by the Lutherans that explained 

the nature of taking civil suits. No one said that to 

16 her, whether it was in someone's mind or not. She found 

17 out on motion for summary judgment. So, therefore, this 

18 wasn't an effort by the religious organization to 

19 express its tenets. She was dismissed.

 She could have -- they could have had a 

21 defense, but it doesn't apply, and, therefore, even 

22 though she's sort of like a minister, she loses. 

23  What are your objections to that? 

24  MR. LAYCOCK: Well, my first objection is I 

don't think those are remotely the facts here. You

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Really? My law clerk 

8 couldn't find it. Can you tell me where -- where 

9 someone did say the reason we're dismissing you is 

because of our religious doctrine that you cannot bring 

11 civil suits? 

12  MR. LAYCOCK: Page 55 of the joint appendix, 

13 which is the letter that -- where they tell her that 

14 they're going to recommend recission of her call, they 

say, because -- because of insubordination and because 

16 you threatened to sue us. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, does anyone explain 

18 to her, which she might not have known, that this is a 

19 religious doctrine that you are supposed to go to the 

synod or whatever, and you're not supposed to go to 

21 court?

3  MR. LAYCOCK: You don't assess the 

4 importance of a doctrine by asking the person --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I understand that. 

6 But I went on a different piece of -- matter, that the 

7 people who were involved in this were doing it for 

8 religious rather than civil reasons. I'm just wondering 

9 what the evidence is that they knew there was such a 

doctrine, that they were motivated by the religious 

11 doctrine, and that they expressed that to her. I 

12 just -- I'll look at page 55. Is there anything else I 

13 should look at? 

14  MR. LAYCOCK: The principal --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- is it in the 

16 handbook? I mean, one of the objections -- if this --

17 if this is a rule that's going to bind the teachers, 

18 then you would expect to find it in the handbook. But 

19 the handbook doesn't tell her, if you complain to the 

EEOC about discrimination, then you will be fired. 

21  MR. LAYCOCK: Well, I don't know if it does 

22 or it doesn't, because the handbook is not in the record

2  JUSTICE BREYER: I'm looking for a citation 

3 in the record? I just wonder, is there anything you 

4 want me to read other than page 55?

 MR. LAYCOCK: Yes. The principal in her 

6 deposition says: The minute she said she might sue, I 

7 said you can't do that; you're a called teacher. 

8  The testimony is the board talked about it 

9 at their meeting on February 22nd. I think that's also 

in the principal's deposition. The president of the 

11 congregation, who did not deal directly with Perich, 

12 said -- said it was one of the first things that he 

13 thought about. Perich was a lifelong Lutheran. She 

14 worked 11 years in Lutheran schools. She had these 

eight theology courses. It's simply not credible that 

16 she didn't know about this doctrine. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Laycock, doesn't this 

18 inquiry illustrate the problems that will necessarily 

19 occur if you get into a pretext analysis? The question 

of was she told that she had violated the church's 

21 teaching about suing in a civil tribunal? Well, that 

22 depends. The significance of -- let's assume she wasn't 

23 told. The significance of that depends on how central a 

24 teaching of Lutheranism this is.

 It's like -- suppose a Catholic priest got

2 parish because of your conduct. Now, there wouldn't be 

3 much question about why that was done. So, you'd have 

4 to get in, what did Martin Luther actually say about --

about suing the church or other Christians in a civil
 

6 tribunal? Is this really a central tenet of
 

7 Lutheranism? Isn't that the problem with going into
 

8 this pretext analysis?
 

9  MR. LAYCOCK: That's just part of the
 

problem. You've got to figure, how does this doctrine 

11 work? How important is it? How does it apply to the 

12 facts of this case? How does it interact with other 

13 doctrines? 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Laycock, you, in 

order, I think, to dispel the notion that nothing is 

16 permitted, in your reply brief you say there are many 

17 suits that could be brought that would not be 

18 inappropriate. And I think it's on page 20 of your 

19 reply brief. But I don't understand how those would 

work if the policy is you're a minister; if you have 

21 quarrels with the church or a co-worker, we have our own 

22 dispute resolution, and you don't go outside. 

23  But you say tort arising from unsafe working 

24 conditions. Suppose one of these commissioned workers

4 agency of the state.

 Why -- I don't follow why the tort claim 

6 based on unsafe working conditions would not fall under 

7 the same ban on -- keeping disputes in-house? 

8  MR. LAYCOCK: Well, it may or it may not. 

9 The rule on internal dispute resolution is most 

emphatically and clearly stated as applying to disputes 

11 over fitness for ministry, and a tort claim may not be a 

12 dispute over fitness for ministry, but what --

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought the reason 

14 that she was unfit for the ministry was that she went 

outside the house. 

16  MR. LAYCOCK: That's right. Yes.

18 you go outside the church, you go to the government,

24 the job back, job qualifications, job performance, or

 MR. LAYCOCK: She could be. And her tort --

6 the tort claim would proceed. We think the retaliation 

7 claim should not proceed. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The tort claim could 

9 proceed, and then she would get damages, and that would 

be all right? 

11  MR. LAYCOCK: She would get damages for the 

12 tort. She would not get damages for the loss of her 

13 position. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you say -- did I 

understand you before, in response to Justice Sotomayor 

16 and Justice Scalia, that even if she were merely a 

17 contract teacher, the fact that she teaches religion 

18 classes would be enough for her to qualify for the 

19 ministerial exception?

 MR. LAYCOCK: Yes. And the fact that she's 

21 a commissioned minister is the clincher in this case. 

22 Teaching --

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the clincher in this 

24 case, but even -- I think you answered if she were not a 

commissioned minister, she's teaching the faith;

4  MR. LAYCOCK: Job duties are enough. The 

commission is not irrelevant. It is the clincher. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, it was certainly for 

7 some purposes. I mean, if every teacher who teaches 

8 religion and math and a lot of other things said, I'm a 

9 minister and I'm entitled to the parsonage allowance on 

my income tax return, certainly that's something that a 

11 government agent would review. 

12  MR. LAYCOCK: Well, they do review it there. 

13 I think there's a -- I don't think the Lutherans have 

14 any problems with the IRS on that. But, yes, that is a 

context where they review these questions.

1 fundamental constitutional right. But it's a right that 

2 must also accommodate important governmental interests 

3 in securing the public welfare. Congress has not 

4 unconstitutionally infringed Petitioner's freedom in 

this case by making it illegal for it to fire a fourth 

6 grade teacher in retaliation for asserting her statutory 

7 rights. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is the position of 

9 the United States that there is a ministerial exception 

or that there is not a ministerial exception? 

11  MS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, if the 

12 ministerial exception is understood as a First Amendment 

13 doctrine that governs the adjudication of disputes 

14 between certain employees and their employers, we agree 

that that First Amendment doctrine exists. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Nothing to do with 

17 respect to the ministers. In other words, is there a 

18 ministerial exception distinct from the right of 

19 association under the First Amendment?

 MS. KRUGER: We think that the ministerial 

21 exception is one that incorporates the right of 

22 association as well as the rights under the religion 

23 clauses.

special about the fact that the people involved in this

3 analysis is one that the Court has -- has elaborated in 

4 other cases involving similar claims to autonomy, 

noninterference --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that a "no"? You 

7 say it's similar to other cases. Expressive 

8 associations -- a group of people who are interested in 

9 labor rights have expressive associations. Is the issue 

we are talking about here in the view of the United 

11 States any different than any other group of people who 

12 get together for an expressive right?

14 the inquiry are not different. We think how the inquiry 

plays out in particular cases may be --

1 we think translate quite well to analyzing the claim 

2 that Petitioner has made here. And for this reason, we 

3 don't think that the job duties of a particular 

4 religious employee in an organization are relevant to 

the inquiry. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: There's nothing in the 

7 Constitution that explicitly prohibits the government 

8 from mucking around in a labor organization. Now, yes, 

9 you -- you can by an extension of First Amendment rights 

derive such a -- but there, black on white in the text 

11 of the Constitution are special protections for 

12 religion. And you say that makes no difference? 

13  MS. KRUGER: Well, Justice Scalia, if I may, 

14 I don't understand Petitioner from the first half of his 

argument to have disputed this basic point, which is 

16 that the contours of the First Amendment doctrine at 

17 issue here will depend on a balancing of interests. 

18 That is the only way, I think, that Petitioner can 

19 differentiate a generally neutrally applicable 

application of anti-discrimination law with respect to a 

21 church's choice of those who would govern it and a 

22 church's retaliation against a teacher who would report 

23 child abuse to the authorities. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that the balancing 

of interests is different, according to the Petitioner,

1 when one of the interests is religion. And you're just 

2 denying that. You say: We balance religion the way we 

3 balance labor organizations. 

4  MS. KRUGER: Well, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's certainly not what 

6 the Petitioner is saying. 

7  MS. KRUGER: Here is where I think what the 

8 core of the insight of the ministerial exception as it 

9 was originally conceived is, which is that there are 

certain relationships within a religious community that 

11 are so fundamental, so private and ecclesiastical in 

12 nature, that it will take an extraordinarily compelling 

13 governmental interest to justify interference. Concerns 

14 with health or safety, for example. But the 

government's general interest in eradicating 

16 discrimination in the workplace will not be sufficient 

17 to justify the burden. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, do you dispute the 

19 proposition that one of the central concerns of the 

Establishment Clause was preventing the government from 

21 choosing ministers? When there was an established 

22 church, the government chose the ministers or had a say 

23 in choosing the ministers. And the Establishment 

24 Clause, many argue, was centrally focused on eliminating 

that governmental power. Now, do you dispute that?

Official 

1  MS. KRUGER: No, Justice Alito, we don't 

2 dispute it. What we do dispute is that what is 

3 happening when the government applies generally 

4 applicable anti-retaliation law to a religious employer 

is that it is choosing a minister on behalf of the
 

6 church. What it is instead doing is preventing
 

7 religious employers, like any other employers, from
 

8 punishing their employees for threatening to bring
 

9 illegal conduct to the attention of --

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that's the central 

11 tenet. Suppose you have a religion and the central 

12 tenet is: You have a problem with what we do, go to the 

13 synod; don't go to court. And that applies to civil 

14 actions of all kinds. All right? So, would that not be 

protected by the First Amendment? 

16  MS. KRUGER: Justice Breyer, two points --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: Your view is it's not 

18 protected? 

19  MS. KRUGER: It's not protected. But I'd 

like -- I think there are two responses that are 

21 relevant to how this Court will resolve that question in 

22 this case. 

23  First of all, if the Court were to accept 

24 the rule that Petitioner would ask it to adopt, we would 

never ask the question whether or not the church has a 

31

1 reason for firing an employee that's rooted in religious 

2 doctrine. Their submission is that the hiring and 

3 firing decisions with respect to parochial school 

4 teachers and with respect to priests is categorically 

off limits. And we think that that is a rule that is
 

6 insufficiently attentive to the relative public and
 

7 private interests at stake, interests that this Court
 

8 has repeatedly recognized are important in
 

9 determining freedom of association claims.


 JUSTICE BREYER: So that, in fact, if they 

11 want to choose to the priest, you could go to the 

12 Catholic Church and say they have to be women. I mean, 

13 you couldn't say that. That's obvious. So, how are you 

14 distinguishing this?

 MS. KRUGER: Right. We think that the --

16 both the private and public interests are very different 

17 in the two scenarios. The government's general interest 

18 in eradicating discrimination in the workplace is simply 

19 not sufficient to justify changing the way that the 

Catholic Church chooses its priests based on gender 

21 roles that are rooted in religious doctrine. 

22  But the interests in this case are quite 

23 different. The government has a compelling and indeed 

24 overriding interest in ensuring that individuals are not 

prevented from coming to the government with information

1 about illegal conduct. 

2  JUSTICE ALITO: When you say that, are you 

3 not implicitly making a judgment about the relative 

4 importance of the Catholic doctrine that only males can 

be ordained as priests and the Lutheran doctrine that a 

6 Lutheran should not sue the church in civil courts? I 

7 don't see any distinction between -- I can't reconcile 

8 your position on those two issues without coming to the 

9 conclusion that you think that the Catholic doctrine is 

older, stronger, and entitled to more respect than the 

11 Lutheran doctrine. 

12  MS. KRUGER: No, we're not -- we're not 

13 drawing distinctions between the importance of a 

14 particular religious tenet in a system of religious 

belief. But the difference is that the government has 

16 a, indeed, foundational interest in ensuring, as a 

17 matter of preserving the integrity of the rule of law, 

18 that individuals are not punished for coming --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying that going to 

church -- sorry -- that going to court is a more 

21 fundamental interest than a woman obtaining the job that 

22 she wants, which happens in this case to be a Catholic 

23 priest. But that's the distinction you're making.

3 isn't obvious to me that the one is the more important 

4 than the other.

 MS. KRUGER: The government's interest in 

6 preventing retaliation against those who would go to 

7 civil authorities with civil wrongs is foundational to 

8 the rule of law. 

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Kruger, if I could just 

clarify for a second there, because you're now sounding 

11 as though you want to draw a sharp line between 

12 retaliation claims and substantive discrimination 

13 claims, and I didn't get that from your brief. So, is 

14 that, in fact, what you're saying?

 MS. KRUGER: I think that there is an 

16 important distinction to be made between the 

17 government's general interest in eradicating 

18 discrimination from the workplace and the government's 

19 interest in ensuring that individuals are not chilled 

from coming to civil authorities with reports about 

21 civil wrongs. 

22  But if I could continue, I think that the --

24 accept the ministerial exception for substantive 

discrimination claims, just not for retaliation claims?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. That was 

6 a yes -- I think that question can be answered yes or 

7 no. 

8  MS. KRUGER: I think that that doesn't -- I 

9 think the answer is no, in part because that doesn't 

fully account for all of the public and private 

11 interests at stake. The government's interest extends 

12 in this case beyond the fact that this is a retaliation 

13 to the fact that this is not a church operating 

14 internally to promulgate and express religious belief 

internally. It is a church that has decided to open its 

16 doors to the public to provide the service, socially 

17 beneficial service, of educating children for a fee, in 

18 compliance with State compulsory education laws. 

19  And this Court has recognized in cases like 

Bob Jones that church-operated schools sit in a 

21 different position with respect to the -- the 

22 permissible scope of governmental regulations than 

23 churches themselves do.

4 because you have to comply with State education
 

requirements on secular subjects, your -- who you pick 

6 to -- to teach theology or to teach religion has to 

7 be -- has to be subject to State control? 

8  MS. KRUGER: Justice Scalia, to be clear, 

9 the government's interest in this case is not in 

dictating to the church-operated school who it may 

11 choose to teach religion classes and who it may not. It 

12 is one thing and one thing only, which is to tell the 

13 school that it may not punish its employees for 

14 threatening to report civil wrongs to civil authorities. 

That is an interest that we think overrides the burden 

16 on the association's religious message about the virtues 

17 of internal dispute resolution as opposed to court 

18 resolution. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you're making --

you're making a judgment about how important a 

21 particular religious belief is to a church. You're 

22 saying -- this may just be the same question Justice 

23 Alito asked -- but you're saying: We don't believe the 

24 Lutheran Church when it says that this is an important 

and central tenet of our faith.

2 Justice. We do not dispute -- when they assert that 

3 it's an important tenet, we assume its validity, we 

4 assume that they are sincere in that religious belief. 

But just as in United States v. Lee, that sincere 

6 religious belief was not sufficient to warrant an 

7 exemption from generally applicable tax laws, as in Bob 

8 Jones, or --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: On the other hand, 

the -- the belief of the Catholic Church that priests 

11 should be male only -- you do defer to that, even if the 

12 Lutherans say, look, our dispute resolution belief is 

13 just as important to a Lutheran as the all-male clergy 

14 is to a Catholic.

 MS. KRUGER: Yes. But that's because the 

16 balance of relative public and private interests is 

17 different in each case. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you believe, Ms. Kruger, 

19 that a church has a right that's grounded in the Free 

Exercise Clause and/or the Establishment Clause to 

21 institutional autonomy with respect to its employees? 

22  MS. KRUGER: We don't see that line of 

23 church autonomy principles in the Religion Clause 

24 jurisprudence as such. We see it as a question of 

freedom of association. We think that this case is

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, this is to go back to
 

3 Justice Scalia's question, because I too find that
 

4 amazing, that you think that the Free -- neither the
 

Free Exercise Clause nor the Establishment Clause has 

6 anything to say about a church's relationship with its 

7 own employees. 

8  MS. KRUGER: We think that this is one of 

9 the cases that Employment Division v. Smith may have 

been referring to when it referred to free association 

11 claims that are reinforced by free exercise concerns. 

12 It's certainly true that the association's claim to 

13 autonomy in this case is one that is deeply rooted. And 

14 concerns about how it exercises its religion -- those 

two things merge in some ways in that respect. But --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think they merge at 

17 all. Smith didn't involve employment by a church. It 

18 had nothing to do with who the church could employ. I 

19 don't -- I don't see how that has any relevance to this.

 I would -- I didn't understand your answer 

21 to the Chief Justice's question. You -- you say that 

22 there were different institutional values or government 

23 values involved with respect to a -- to a Catholic 

24 priest than there is with respect to this Lutheran 

minister. Let's assume that a Catholic priest is -- is

 Would you -- would you allow the government 

6 to go -- go into the -- into the dismissal of the 

7 Catholic priest to see whether indeed it -- it was

12  MS. KRUGER: -- but that is the --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that any different 

14 from the Lutheran minister?

 MS. KRUGER: I would begin with looking at 

16 the burdens on association under the balancing test. I 

17 think that the core of the understanding of the 

18 ministerial exception, as it was elaborated in the lower 

19 courts, is that there is a fundamental difference

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's saying 

3 nothing different than what the Chief Justice suggests, 

4 that you think the one is more -- is more important to 

-- to Catholics than the other is to Lutherans. 

6  MS. KRUGER: I don't think it's a question 

7 of the importance of either function to the -- the 

8 religious association. It's a question of the realm 

9 of permissible governmental regulation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but then you have to 

11 say that it's more important to let people go to court 

12 to sue about sex discrimination than it is for a woman 

13 to get a job. I can't say that one way or the other. 

14 So -- so, I'm stuck.

 And since I'm really -- this is tough and 

16 I'm stuck on this, I don't see how you can avoid going 

17 into religion to some degree. You have to decide if 

18 this is really a minister, for example, and what kind of 

19 minister. That gets you right involved. Or if you're 

not going to do that, you're going to go look to see 

21 what are their religious tenets? And that gets you 

22 right involved. 

23  I just can't see a way of getting out of 

24 something -- of getting out of the whole thing. I don't 

see how to do it. So, suppose you said in case of doubt

1 like that, we'll try what Congress suggested. And now 

2 we have here a borderline case of ministry, not the 

3 heartland case. So, you say, all right, where you have 

4 a borderline case the constitutional issue goes away, 

and what Congress said is okay. So, now what you have 

6 to prove is you have to prove that -- the church has to 

7 show that the applicant was disciplined, or whatever, 

8 because she didn't conform to the religious tenets. All 

9 right? That's what they have to show.

 And I'm sorry; they maybe only make a prima 

11 facie case, but they got to show it, and if they don't 

12 show that there was at least some evidence to that 

13 effect and that somebody knew about the religious tenet 

14 and there was something like that -- maybe it's in the 

air, as is obvious with Justice Alito's question, but 

16 where it isn't in the air, you'd have to make a showing. 

17  Now -- now, I see that's an interference, 

18 but I don't see how you avoid an interference someplace 

19 or the other. Otherwise, you're going to get into who 

is a minister. 

21  So, what's the answer to this dilemma? At 

22 the moment I'm making an argument for following what 

23 Congress said, go back and try it that way, and if they 

24 can show in this case and she shows in this case nobody 

ever thought of the religious tenet, nobody told me,

2 they come in and show that they really did this because 

3 of their religious tenet, they'll win. What about that? 

4  MS. KRUGER: Justice Breyer, I think that 

that is a perfectly appropriate way to come at this 

6 case, although it skips over sort of the initial 

7 inquiry, which is into whether or not the application of 

8 the regulation to the particular employment relationship 

9 results in an unwarranted interference.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it does have the 

11 virtue of deciding a statutory question before a tough 

12 constitutional question. And I agree, with what we 

13 sometimes do, that seems bizarre, but I thought that was 

14 the basic rule.

 MS. KRUGER: I think that that's absolutely 

16 right, Justice Breyer. And I think the next question 

17 becomes, with respect to adjudicating a particular case, 

18 whether deciding the case would require the court to 

19 decide disputed matters of religious doctrine or to 

second-guess essentially subjective --

21  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if -- if the plaintiff 

22 proceeded that way, would she be entitled to -- I assume 

23 she would -- introduce testimony by experts on 

24 Lutheranism, theologians, professors of religion about

side, and you'd have a court and a lay jury deciding how 

6 important this really is to Lutherans. Is that how that 

7 would play out?

9 out.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How are you going to avoid 

11 that? I just don't see it. 

12  MS. KRUGER: Any inquiry into the validity 

13 of a particular religious doctrine is simply irrelevant 

14 to the adjudication of the dispute, which is designed to 

find out just one thing, which is whether the --

16  JUSTICE ALITO: No, it's not irrelevant. 

17 I've seen dozens and dozens and dozens of pretext cases, 

18 and in practically every pretext case that I've seen, 

19 one of the central issues is whether the reason that was 

proffered by the employer is the real reason, is an 

21 important reason for that, for that employer, and 

22 whether they really think it's important and whether 

23 they apply it across the board. That's almost always a 

24 big part of the case.

2 don't see it. 

3  Let me give you an example of a real case. 

4 A nun wanted to be -- wanted a tenured position teaching 

canon law at Catholic University, and she claimed that 

6 she was denied tenure because of her -- because of her 

7 gender. 

8  Now, there the university might argue, no, 

9 she was -- and did argue -- she's denied tenure because 

of the quality of her -- of her scholarship. And, okay, 

11 now, if you try that pretext issue, the issue is going 

12 to be what is the real quality of her canon law 

13 scholarship? And you're going to have the judge and the 

14 jury decide whether the particular writings on canon law 

are -- make a contribution to canon law scholarship. 

16 How can something like that be tried, without getting 

17 into religious issues? 

18  MS. KRUGER: If the only way that the 

19 plaintiff has to show that that may not have been the 

employer's real reason was a subjective judgment about 

21 the quality of canon law scholarship, then judgment has 

22 to be entered for the employer, because the plaintiff 

23 has no viable way, consistent with the Establishment 

24 Clause, of demonstrating that wasn't the employer's real 

reason.

1  If, on the other hand, the plaintiff has 

2 evidence that no one ever raised any objections to the 

3 quality of her scholarship, but they raised objections 

4 to women serving in certain roles in the school, and 

those roles were not ones that were required to be 

6 filled by persons of a particular gender, consistent 

7 with religious beliefs, then that's a case in which a 

8 judge can instruct a jury that it's job is not to 

9 inquire into the validity of the subjective judgment, 

just as juries are often instructed that their job is 

11 not to determine whether an employer's business judgment 

12 was fair or correct, but only whether the employer was 

13 motivated by discrimination or retaliation.

9 that's founded in the Religion Clauses, and tell me who 

counts as a minister, and why this commissioned minister 

11 does not count as a minister? 

12  MR. DELLINGER: I believe that there is an 

13 exemption grounded in the Religion Clauses. It means 

14 that religious organizations will win -- will prevail in 

many cases in which a comparable civil organization 

16 would not prevail. I don't think that it makes sense to

22  MR. DELLINGER: Well, in our view, if that

Pope is a head of state carrying out secular functions; 

6 right? 

7  (Laughter.) 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those are important. 

9 So, he is not a minister?

 MR. DELLINGER: Chief Justice Roberts, I do 

11 not want to suggest that it's a very good approach to 

12 try to decide who's a minister and who's not a minister. 

13 That's what's wrong with Professor Laycock's categorical 

14 approach, because it's -- it's both over- and 

under-inclusive. It sweeps in cases where there is, in 

16 fact, no religious reason offered --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's only a bad approach if 

18 we adopt your test. Why isn't it a perfectly reasonable 

19 test whether the person -- although the person may have 

a lot of secular duties, whether the person has 

21 substantial religious responsibilities? 

22  MR. DELLINGER: And the reason that is not a 

23 satisfactory test is that it fails to take account of 

24 the important governmental interests -- for example, in 

this case -- in having everyone have access to the -- to

2  JUSTICE BREYER: No, but that isn't -- but 

3 that isn't the problem. The problem, it seems to me, is 

4 I don't know how substantial these interests are 

religiously. I don't know how substantial the religion 

6 itself considers what they do from a religious 

7 perspective. 

8  So, let's go back to Justice Alito's 

9 problem. And now on the ministerial issue, we call the 

synods, we call the how certain was it, how central is 

11 it to the heart of the religion, what they're actually 

12 doing, and we replicate exactly what he said, in respect 

13 to the problem of religious tenet, now in respect to the 

14 problem of religious minister.

 And maybe you can tell me we don't have to 

16 go into the one or the other, but I've had enough of 

17 these cases in the lower court to know they are really 

18 hard. People believe really different things, and I see 

19 no way to avoid going into one or the other, and, 

therefore, I think, rather than try this constitutional 

21 matter, let's go to the one Congress suggested.

1  JUSTICE BREYER: That's the state of the
 

2 argument that you're walking into, I think.
 

3  MR. DELLINGER: If we go to Congress,
 

4 Congress made it quite clear how this case should be
 

resolved, because Congress expressly did not apply the 

6 religious exemptions of the ADA to retaliation. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: No. I don't agree with 

8 that. I think -- I think what it says is a religious 

9 organization may require that all applicants and 

employees conform to the religious tenets. It put that 

11 in the section defining defenses. The defenses are part 

12 of the right, and when it forbids retaliation, it says 

13 forbids retaliation against an individual for the 

14 exercise of any right granted.

 And, therefore, I don't believe that a 

16 person who has failed to violate the substantive section 

17 could be held up normally. 

18  I mean, I don't --

19  MR. DELLINGER: Well, we differ on that, 

but --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: I can think it's pretty 

22 easy to read that exception, even though it's in a 

23 different subchapter, into the retaliation exception. 

24  And assume for me that that's so.

 MR. DELLINGER: It is still the case that it

1 is a constitutional matter. The state's interest in

this case, it's -- we are mindful --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not paramount.
 

7 Would you -- take the firing of the Catholic priest
 

8 example. Does that get into the courts?
 

9  MR. DELLINGER: No, it doesn't and the
 

reason is --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? 

12  MR. DELLINGER: -- that there is -- and that 

13 points out, Justice Scalia, that there are ample 

14 doctrines to protect church autonomy. One is that under 

the Establishment Clause, there can be no reinstatement 

16 ordered by a court of someone to an ecclesiastical 

17 position. Another mentioned by General Kruger is 

18 that --

22 he can be reinstated or get damages for removal from

2 that is very likely to fail because you're going to run 

3 into (a) issues of religious doctrine or evaluations of 

4 distinctly religious matters, like EEOC v. Catholic 

University. Those doctrines still stand. 

6  The problem with the -- this categorical 

7 exception is it sweeps in cases like this one, where the 

8 well-pleaded complaint in this case simply says, I was 

9 dismissed from my employment because I said I was going 

to make a report to the EEOC. And she's not seeking 

11 reinstatement. She just wants the economic loss. 

12 There's no need --

13  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if I could just come 

14 back to the example of the canon law professor, because 

I still don't see how the -- the approach that the 

16 Solicitor General is recognizing -- is recommending 

17 could -- can eliminate the problems involved in pretext. 

18 So, the -- as I understood her -- her answer, it was 

19 that you couldn't look into the question of whether the 

professor's canon law scholarship was really good canon 

21 law scholarship, but you could try the issue of sex 

22 discrimination based on other evidence. So, maybe 

23 there's some stray remarks here and there about a woman 

24 teaching canon law.

 Now, a response to that might be that wasn't

4 real reason.

 So, you just cannot get away from evaluating 

6 religious issues. 

7  MR. DELLINGER: This is not a problem that 

8 is unique to ministerial employees, which is why this is 

9 both over- and under-inclusive. When you -- this is a 

circumstance in which an organization is going into the 

11 public arena providing a public service, and in that 

12 situation, it ought to be governed by the same rules --

13 Justice Scalia, you said this case is not like 

14 Employment Division v. Smith, but under Employment 

Division v. Smith, we know that the State could forbid a 

16 school from -- a religious school from using peyote in 

17 its ceremonies, but under Petitioner's submission, they 

18 could fire any employee who reported that use of peyote 

19 to civil authorities, and that employee would have no 

recourse. 

21  We know that under U.S. v. Lee, an Amish 

22 employer has to comply with the Social Security laws, 

23 but under their submission, the employer could fire 

24 without recourse any employee who called noncompliance 

to the attention of the EEOC. We believe that -- that

2 there needs to be additional accommodations; Congress 

3 could make them, just as Justice Scalia suggested. The 

4 ministerial exemption has a long history, Justice Alito, 

but in almost every circuit, it did not apply to 

6 teachers. So, I mean --

7  JUSTICE ALITO: It antedated -- did it not 

8 antedate the enactment of the Americans with 

9 Disabilities Act?

 MR. DELLINGER: That is correct. When that 

11 was enacted --

12  JUSTICE ALITO: So, wouldn't -- shouldn't we 

13 assume that Congress -- that Congress assumed that it 

14 would continue to apply to the ADA, just as it applied 

to Title VII. 

16  MR. DELLINGER: It -- in the lower courts 

17 did not apply it as sweepingly as to teachers. And I --

18 I think we have this debate with Justice Breyer about 

19 whether -- whether you can say that Congress 

specifically excluded retaliation -- retaliation cases. 

21  But remember that that doctrine emerged at a 

22 time when this Court had a position that religious 

23 organizations could not participate in getting public

6  MR. LAYCOCK: No.

2 has some -- some points here about the way in which the 

3 ministerial exception relates or doesn't relate to 

4 Employment Division v. Smith. And it seems to me that 

in order to make an argument for the ministerial 

6 exception, you in some sense have to say that 

7 institutional autonomy is different from individual 

8 conscience, that we've said in Smith that state 

9 interests can trump individual conscience. And you want 

us to say that they can't trump institutional autonomy. 

11 So, why is that? 

12  MR. LAYCOCK: It's not that institutions are 

13 different from individuals. It is that the 

14 institutional governance of the church is at a prior 

step. Smith is about whether people can act on their 

16 religious teachings after they're formulated. The 

17 selection of ministers is about the process by which 

18 those religious teachings will be formulated.
