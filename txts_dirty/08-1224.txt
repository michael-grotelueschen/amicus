CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 08-1224, United States v. 

Comstock. 

General Kagan. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

GENERAL KAGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

Article I of the Constitution permits 

Congress to enact section 4248, which is the limited 

Federal civil commitment statute at issue in this 

case. 

To see why, to understand the basis for this 

statute, it might be helpful to go all the way back to 

1945, when what this Court later called "a 

conspicuously able committee of Federal judges" 

recommended that Congress pass section 4246, a very 

similar civil commitment law that has been on the 

books for some 60 years. 

The committee there wrote that the law was 

necessary to deal with what it called the serious 

problem of what to do with insane criminals -- and I'm 

quoting now -- "upon the expiration of their terms of

confinement, where it would be dangerous to turn them 

loose upon society and where no State will assume 

responsibility for their custody." 

That is exactly what Congress concluded 

here. Congress could reasonably find that section 

4248 was necessary to prevent a similar problem. The 

Federal Government has mentally ill, sexually 

dangerous persons in its custody. It knows that those 

persons, if released, will commit serious sexual 

offenses; and it knows too that States are often not 

in a position to deal with such dangers, not in a 

position to take custody and care and responsibility 

for those persons upon release from Federal prison. 

This is essentially a transitional problem 

that the Court was -- that the Congress was dealing 

with, how to manage the transition from Federal 

custody to State superintendence and responsibility. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is part of the 

statutory scheme that you can be committed to Federal 

custody for, say, a year and then the State takes it 

over? 

GENERAL KAGAN: That is correct, Justice 

Kennedy. In fact, what the statute requires is for 

the Attorney General really to -- immediately upon 

commitment, to go to a State, if he hasn't done so

domicile and the State of prior conviction. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why would a State want to 

incur that extra expense if --

GENERAL KAGAN: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- if the Federal 

Government is going to do it for them? 

GENERAL KAGAN: What Congress found was that 

States often were not willing to incur that extra 

expense, even if the Federal Government was not going 

to do that for them, and what this legislation was, 

was a response to that reality. It was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the experience 

under 4246? You pointed out that that has been on the 

books for some time, and there efforts must be made to 

have the State take the person. 

When the civil commitment is used following 

the end of a term -- let's say someone is insane --

how often does it end up that the State takes 

responsibility and how often is it that the person 

stays in Federal custody? 

GENERAL KAGAN: I think it is unusual, 

Justice Ginsburg. It’s not the usual course that the 

State does take responsibility. But the Federal 

statute commits the Attorney General and the Bureau of

Prisons to try to persuade a State to take custody, to 

defer to the State if a State has some reason to take 

custody, but -- but makes sure that the Federal 

Government is a kind of backstop, so that if the State 

does not take responsibility and does not take 

custody, the Federal Government will ensure that the 

person will not be released, the person who has been 

found to be both mentally ill and sexually --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the likelihood is 

that the person will stay in Federal custody? 

GENERAL KAGAN: I think that that's fair, 

that the likelihood is that the person will stay in 

Federal custody until such time as a court finds that 

the reasons for that custody have lapsed. But, again, 

the State always has the ability to come in and say: 

We would like to take control over this person. And 

more to the point, the Attorney General has the 

responsibility to keep going to the State and to try 

to see if he can transfer custody to the State. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what -- what power 

conferred upon the Federal Government by the 

Constitution permits the Federal Government to assure 

that sexual predators are not at large? 

GENERAL KAGAN: I think the power, Justice 

Scalia, is the power to run a responsible criminal

justice system, to run a criminal justice system that 

does not itself endanger the public. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you would say 

that the Federal Government has no such power 

independent of the criminal conviction? In other 

words, that Congress could not pass a law saying, just 

as this one says, we are going to commit people who 

are sexually dangerous until a determination that they 

are not or until the State can take them? That power 

would not be in Article I? 

GENERAL KAGAN: Without the person having 

entered the criminal justice system in any way. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. I understand 

your argument to be that this power is necessary and 

proper, given the fact that the person is in Federal 

custody for some other reason, criminal conviction. 

GENERAL KAGAN: That has been the 

government's case throughout this litigation, that it 

has always depended on the fact of Federal custody, on 

the fact that this person has entered the criminal 

justice system, has been -- four of the five of these 

people --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 

GENERAL KAGAN: -- have been convicted and 

have served prison terms. And the question really is,

well, given that, given that the Federal Government 

has custody of these people, that it's difficult for 

the States to -- to take responsibility for these 

people after the prison term is finished. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why doesn't 

the Federal Government's authority to have custody 

because of the criminal justice system end when the 

criminal justice system is exhausted? In other words, 

when the sentence is done? 

GENERAL KAGAN: Because the Federal 

Government has a responsibility to ensure that release 

of the people it has in its custody is done 

responsibly, is done in such a way --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you said no. I mean, 

there is no constitutional power on the part of the 

Federal Government to protect society from sexual 

predators. And, you know, once the Federal custody is 

at an end, it seems to me that's the only power you 

could be relying upon. 

GENERAL KAGAN: I think that the power to 

run a responsible criminal justice system extends to 

the way in which the Federal Government releases these 

prisoners. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the Federal 

Government order a commitment of anyone who's been in

Federal custody over the last 10 years? 

GENERAL KAGAN: Justice Kennedy, I think 

that that would be a much harder case. There are some 

people, of course, who are on supervised release and, 

for example --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, no. That makes 

your -- my hypo too easy for you. 

(Laughter.) 

GENERAL KAGAN: Okay. Well, I’ll grab your 

difficult hypo, then. And I would say that that would 

be a different case and that the Federal Government 

would not have the -- the power to commit a person who 

is -- has been released from prison and whose period 

of supervised release is also completed. At that 

point, the release has been -- the transfer to State 

responsibility and State control has occurred, and the 

Federal Government would have no appropriate role. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that must be because 

there is a lack of Federal power. 

GENERAL KAGAN: Yes, I think that that's 

correct, that at that point the State police power 

over a person has been fully reestablished. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's fully 

reestablished once he walks out of Federal prison, at 

least if he walks out of Federal prison into a State.

GENERAL KAGAN: I think that that's not 

right, Justice Scalia. I think that there is a 

transition period, and what this statute is designed 

to do is to deal with that transition period and to 

make sure that sexually dangerous, mentally ill people 

don't fall through the cracks between Federal custody 

and the reestablishment of State control. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but they don't fall 

through the cracks if the Federal Government notifies 

the State into which this prisoner is to be released: 

We are going to release a prisoner; we think he's 

sexually dangerous; you should take some action to be 

sure that he doesn't harm society. Because that's a 

State police function, it's none of our business. 

GENERAL KAGAN: I think Congress could 

reasonably find that that is insufficient. Congress 

could reasonably find that the State -- that the 

relationship between the State and the individual has 

been sufficiently disrupted as a result of what is in 

many of these cases an extended period of Federal 

custody, that it's not so easy to establish --

reestablish it all at once. And I would point to you 

as proof of this the supervised release system itself.

dangerous person, whether it's because of mental 

illness or any other reason, could be held 

indefinitely --

GENERAL KAGAN: No --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- under a civil 

commitment statute, because what you're saying is that 

the Federal Government, merely because of their --

their time in control of the individual, has an 

unlimited constitutional power to then civilly commit 

this dangerous person. 

GENERAL KAGAN: I think what would prevent 

that, Justice Sotomayor, is the Due Process Clause. 

It is obviously the case that there are other 

constraints on governmental action than Article I. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, what -- what 

constrains the government under the Due Process Clause 

from invoking a dangerousness merely because someone 

has a long history. We have many criminal defendants 

with long histories of violent behavior. Many of them 

continue that violent behavior in prison, and some of 

them at the end of their term are let out, because 

their term has been completed. So what -- what in 

the Due Process Clause protects --

GENERAL KAGAN: Well, I think that the 

history of this Court's cases would suggest that if

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's where I'm 

trying to understand --

GENERAL KAGAN: Yes, that the civil --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the connection 

between the nature of the mental illness and the 

constitutional power that you are claiming. What --

what is it that gives you that power? 

GENERAL KAGAN: Well, if you go back to a 

case like Kansas v. Hendricks, which is of course 

where this Court thought about civil commitment 

statutes with relation to sexually dangerous 

offenders, I think the Court made clear that it was 

important in that case that there be not only sexual 

dangerousness, but also mental illness, in order to 

invoke the civil commitment statutes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying that as 

far as those limitations, the question that Justice 

Sotomayor was asking, the limitations on the Federal 

Government would be the same as they are on the 

States? But that’s a different question from whether 

the Federal Government has any power at all. 

GENERAL KAGAN: You said it better than I 

did, Justice Ginsburg. That’s exactly right, that of

course there are constraints on the Federal Government 

in using civil commitment statutes, that they are the 

same as the -- the constitutional constraints on the 

States when they use that power. But this is a 

different question. The question presented here is 

only whether -- assuming that the Federal Government 

is acting within other constitutional constraints in 

making this civil commitment, whether Article I 

enables it to do so because of the special custodial 

role in these cases. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: General Kagan, you are 

relying on the Necessary and Proper Clause, right? 

You say: But “necessary and proper” doesn't mean it’s 

necessary and proper for the good of society. It 

means it’s necessary and proper for the execution of 

another power that the Federal Government is given by 

the Constitution. 

Now, why is this necessary for the execution 

of any Federal power? The Federal criminal proceeding 

has terminated. The individual is released. You 

could say it's necessary for the good of society, but 

that's not what the Federal Government is charged 

with. Why is it necessary to any function that the 

Federal Government is performing? It has completed 

its performance of the function of incarcerating this

individual until he has served his punishment. 

GENERAL KAGAN: The Court has always said, 

Justice Scalia, that the Necessary and Proper Clause, 

the question is, is it necessary and proper to the 

beneficial exercise of Federal powers? And so this 

is, that it is necessary and proper to the beneficial 

or, what I said before, the responsible exercise of 

the Federal power to operate a criminal justice 

system, which includes the responsibility to ensure 

that those people who have been in custody in that 

Federal -- in that criminal justice system are not 

released irresponsibly. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn’t it the case that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the brief -- excuse 

me. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I was going to ask, is 

it the case that the unwillingness of States to step 

into this area in these instances is a consequence, at 

least in part and perhaps in large part, of the 

Federal incarceration, that as a result of the Federal 

incarceration, the person is no longer viewed by the 

State as -- as having domicile within the State, the 

State of prior domicile has no way of knowing whether 

that person would return to a domicile in the prior 

State? Is that -- do you think that is a fair

understanding of the reason for the enactment of this? 

GENERAL KAGAN: Just to make sure that I 

understand the question, that the reason for the 

enactment in part has to do with the fact that the 

Federal Government has assumed custodial 

responsibility and has disrupted the relationship 

between the State and the citizen, I think that that’s 

exactly right, Justice Alito. 

But in some sense, it's not just that the 

Federal system finds itself in possession and custody 

of these people, but the Federal -- what Congress 

could reasonably find is that the Federal Government 

knows that there’s nobody else to take appropriate 

custody and care and that the reason that there’s 

nobody else to take appropriate custody and care has 

to do with the Federal action itself. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, is the prisoner --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if there were --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- is it a prisoner 

who has served his time in, say, a Federal 

penitentiary in Ohio but is a domiciliary of Arizona, 

what happens when the prisoner is released, say, after 

10 years? Released to Ohio, sent back to Arizona? 

What? 

GENERAL KAGAN: The default position is that

the prisoner is released to the place where the 

prisoner was convicted. Now, that -- the prisoner may 

or may not have any relationship with that State. The 

person may have lived there, may not have lived there. 

The -- the Federal prison system does 

sometimes make other arrangements. The idea behind 

any release is to try to make sure that the person is 

released to the place where a -- a future lawful life 

will be most likely. But in many of these cases, the 

prisoner ends up being released to a State that has no 

current relationship with the -- with the prisoner, 

sometimes has had -- never had any relationship with 

the prisoner, and at any rate doesn't now, because the 

period of Federal custody has disrupted that 

relationship. 

And what the Federal Government is doing 

here is essentially to deal with this transition 

problem to make -- to make sure these people don't 

fall between the -- the cracks, and to ensure that 

where there is a sexually violent and mentally ill 

person who one has reason to believe will commit 

further offenses, that appropriate care and custody of 

those people is ensured. 

Now, this is no different from what Congress 

has done on other occasions as well. This is not the

first such Federal civil commitment statute. This is 

not a newfangled thing. Section 4248 is identical in 

-- in all relevant constitutional respects to section 

4246, which is the general civil commitment statute 

for mentally ill, dangerous people generally, not with 

any sexual --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, General --

GENERAL KAGAN: -- component to it. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood you in 

your response to Justice Alito to say, if I remember, 

that it was not just the fact of Federal custody, but 

the fact that there are no States or there may well 

often be no States willing. What if every State is 

willing; I mean, every State is willing to take the 

people on out of a concern to protect their citizens. 

Does that somehow mean there’s no necessary and proper 

power? 

GENERAL KAGAN: I think when we are dealing 

with the Necessary and Proper Clause, we are asking 

ourselves whether Congress reasonably acted in a given 

situation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess it wouldn't 

be necessary, is what you are saying?

such that there were no difficulty with this 

transition period and that nobody ever fell between 

the cracks, an entirely different question would be 

presented, and then there would be some kind of 

argument that at that point, in those circumstances 

State police power would be the appropriate default 

position. But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: General Kagan, I -- I find 

it difficult to believe that if the Federal Bureau of 

Prisons wrote the governor of the State into which 

this person is to be released, and they try to release 

him in the State where he -- he will in the future 

reside, and said, we are about to release this person 

in 60 days or whatever, in our view there are serious 

mental problems, and we think the State ought to 

consider commitment proceedings, I find it difficult 

to believe that an elected governor or an elected 

attorney general would ignore that letter. 

GENERAL KAGAN: I do believe, Justice 

Scalia, that Congress reasonably could have found that 

there were difficulties in making this transition. 

The cost of commitment of these people is very high, 

much higher than standard incarceration. I believe 

the States say in their amicus brief that it's some 

$65,000 a year per person per year, and -- and the

answer to Justice Scalia, is history, and it's history 

on two separate occasions, which this Court has noted. 

It's history when -- when this committee of 

Federal judges chaired by Calvert Magruder, including 

Learned Hand, said we have a real problem here with 

people being let go out of the Federal system and the 

States not stepping forward and taking responsibility

for them. And the Court confronted and -- and thought 

about the exact same problem when Congress passed in 

1984 section 4243, which is the civil commitment 

statute that applies to insanity acquittees, people 

who are acquitted on the basis of insanity. 

And this Court in Shannon said that, I think 

the -- the language is, "Federal courts decried time 

and again the gaping statutory hole," that is the hole 

that -- that existed because people were acquitted on 

the basis of insanity and -- and States were not 

willing to step forward and take custody of those 

people in the way that they would have taken custody 

of those people if they had been acquitted of insanity 

in the State court systems. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I must say I'm -- I'm not 

terribly impressed with -- with the argument --

GENERAL KAGAN: I can tell, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the States won't do it. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, this -- this is a 

recipe for the Federal Government taking over 

everything. 

GENERAL KAGAN: No, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The States won't do it; 

therefore, we have to do it. It has to be done, and

therefore the Federal Government steps in and does it. 

GENERAL KAGAN: I don't think so, Justice 

Scalia. I think, in fact, that -- that Congress on 

each of these three occasions has limited the civil 

commitment power only to people who have been -- who 

are in the custody of the Federal Government and over 

whom the Federal Government has a distinctive 

responsibility. 

I will give you an example, Justice Scalia. 

I mean, suppose that there was some very contagious 

form of drug-resistant tuberculosis that had -- had 

become prevalent in the prison system, and States were 

not able to deal with that, with quarantining these 

people upon their release date, and Congress said: 

You know, the best thing to do is to have the Federal 

Government act as the appropriate quarantining 

authority because we don't think that States are able 

to step up and deal with this problem. 

Would anybody say that the Federal 

Government would not have Article I power to effect 

that kind of public safety measure? And the exact 

same thing is true here. This is exactly what 

Congress is doing here, is to make sure that mentally 

ill, sexually dangerous --

about your hypothetical, I thought, well, that's a 

pretty easy commerce power argument. I -- I notice 

that in -- in the government's position, you don't 

argue the Commerce Clause very much, and I -- we’ve 

got Morrison v. Brzonkala looking at you and Printz 

and so forth. 

But it -- suppose Congress said there is a 

class of committable, dangerous sex offenders that are 

crossing State lines and using interstate facilities, 

and made those findings. Would that be sufficient to 

establish a Federal commitment law? 

GENERAL KAGAN: Well, as you say, Justice 

Kennedy, the government has never argued the Commerce 

Clause here in the sense that it has never argued that 

these activities have a substantial effect on 

interstate commerce, and it hasn't done so because of 

the Morrison -- the Morrison precedent. 

The Commerce Clause I think is relevant in 

two ways. It's relevant first because, of course, 

it's often the Commerce Clause that gives rise to the 

power to criminalize conduct and to punish people for 

that conduct. So I think in -- in three of the five 

of these cases, the initial power to criminalize the 

conduct is based on the Commerce Clause. 

The Commerce Clause is also relevant here

because the Commerce Clause does give rise to a set of 

Federal laws having to do with sexual offenses, sexual 

solicitation of a minor, sexual exploitation of a 

minor when interstate commerce is involved, and when 

the Internet is involved. And we do think that that 

provides an additional basis, not a sufficient basis, 

but an additional basis to -- to approve this law in 

the sense that these are the people who are most 

likely, really, to violate such Federal laws which are 

based on the Commerce Clause in the future. 

And the reason they are most likely is 

because all of them have done it once before, and all 

of them have been found to have the kind of mental 

illness that makes it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's -- but that's 

an easier case, because at least you have an 

interstate connection to the offensive conviction and 

the ground for future commitment. But these statutes 

don't depend on that element being a part of the 

commitment process. There's no -- there's no 

congressional -- there's no tie to a congressional 

power that justifies the commitment other than that 

the person is sexually dangerous. 

GENERAL KAGAN: The -- the essential tie to 

a congressional power is the tie of these people to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's that special 

relationship. 

GENERAL KAGAN: That's -- that's right. And 

in addition to that, these are the people who are most 

likely to violate Federal laws based on the Commerce 

Clause in the future -- most likely to violate such 

laws because they have done so in the past and because 

they have mental conditions that make it extremely 

difficult --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it true that 

this statute applies even if a person has not been a 

sexual offender in the past? 

GENERAL KAGAN: It -- it does, Justice 

Stevens. There have been 103 --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So that argument doesn't 

take care of that --

GENERAL KAGAN: Just to put some numbers on 

the table, there have been 103 people who have been 

certified under these laws. Eight under -- under this

robbery or bank robbery, and just before the end of 

his term in prison the authorities decide he is in 

fact a potential sexual offender. They can detain 

him. 

GENERAL KAGAN: Yes, yes, that's right. As 

I was saying, 20 of these people fall within that 

category, that -- that they are in prison for a 

nonsexual offense. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. 

GENERAL KAGAN: All of those people have had 

prior sexual convictions in their history. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's not -- that's 

not a necessary element of the -- of the statute --

under the statute, is it? 

GENERAL KAGAN: What is necessary is two 

things: First, that the person in fact have engaged 

in sexually violent behavior or child molestation. So 

there’s a factual predicate there. And -- and so far, 

the Bureau of Prisons has found that about 15,000 

people whom it has reviewed meet that factual 

predicate. Of those, the Bureau of Prisons has 

certified only 105 of those, who were also found to 

have the kind of mental illness that made it 

reasonably likely that -- that they would continue to 

commit this -- these kinds of offenses.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ALAN DUBOIS 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. DUBOIS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

I really think the government gives the game 

away a bit in its opening statement when it 

characterized this law as a law that was necessary to 

prevent the problem of releasing sexually dangerous 

individuals. And I don't think that that is what the 

Necessary and Proper Clause is designed to do. 

The power to enforce the law which brought 

the defendants into Federal custody in the first place 

has been exhausted. The defendant has been tried and 

convicted, and he's sentenced and he's served his 

sentence. That law has been fully vindicated. At 

that point, any further detention must stand on an 

independent constitutional footing. It cannot --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you -- Mr. DuBois, do 

you take that same position with respect to not guilty

by reason of insanity? Someone is convicted, say, in 

the District of Columbia -- say, John Hinckley is 

found by the jury to be not guilty by reason of 

insanity, must he then be allowed out of Federal 

custody, and it depends if his home State or any other 

State wants to pick him up? 

MR. DUBOIS: No, Justice Ginsburg. I think 

not guilty by reason of insanity is a -- is a 

different case for a couple of reasons. First off, 

the commitment that flows from a not guilty by reason 

of insanity verdict is directly linked to the Federal 

law which brought you into custody in the first place. 

The person is found to be -- to have been committed 

the crime, but he is only -- he is only excused from 

punishment for that crime by basis of his mental 

illness. So there’s a direct link between the -- the 

crime which brought you into Federal custody and your 

subsequent commitment. 

The other distinction, of course, is that 

not guilty by reason of insanity must be pled by the 

defendant, and in some sense the commitment is in lieu 

of punishment; it's not an additional punishment 

tacked on at the end of the sentence. So I don't 

think that the infirmities of 4248 are at play at all 

in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so what's the power 

that the Federal Government is exercising when it 

commits someone who has been found not guilty by 

reason of insanity? 

MR. DUBOIS: They are vindicating their 

interest in the specific criminal law which brought 

the individual into custody, which presumably in most 

cases -- in all cases, I guess -- is supported by an 

enumerated power. It is -- as I say, the commitment 

is -- is a substitute for punishment, it's in lieu of 

punishment, but it's directly linked to the crime 

which brought the individual into Federal custody. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. DuBois, what is your 

answer to the hypothetical that General Kagan posited? 

Supposing after a man has been sentenced, say, to 30 

days for gun possession, 20 -- 10 days before he is to 

be released, it's determined he has a communicable 

disease -- he would spread a disease if he gets out. 

Could the -- could the Federal Government have the 

power to detain him at the end of the 30 days? 

MR. DUBOIS: Well, Your Honor, I think a 

single individual with a single communicable disease, 

a defendant with tuberculosis --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. 

MR. DUBOIS: -- or something of that nature,

JUSTICE STEVENS: It may not call for it. 

My question is would it have the power --

MR. DUBOIS: I would say --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- not to release him, 

because there -- there’s strong evidence that, as soon 

as he gets into the society, the disease will -- will 

pass to others? 

MR. DUBOIS: Well, Your Honor, I would say 

that, in the same way that mental health is a uniquely 

State function, so too is public health. And we would 

say that, no, the Federal Government cannot detain 

that person past the end of his sentence, and that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We -- we have a Federal 

agency that's -- that deals with communicable 

diseases. It's part of the National Institute of 

Health, I believe. Is that agency ultra vires? I 

mean, aren't communicable -- I mean, if anything 

relates to interstate commerce, it's communicable 

diseases, it seems to me. 

MR. DUBOIS: I was about to say, Your Honor, 

you know, that's the -- that's the other I think 

significant difference that Justice Kennedy pointed 

out, that there is a clear hook to interstate commerce

when we are talking about communicable diseases, and 

that hook is simply not present. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why -- why not? I 

mean, is there anything to prevent the United States 

Government to say: Mental illness is a serious 

problem in the United States, and we feel the States 

sometimes do a good job, sometimes they don't, but we 

want to set up a group of Federal mental hospitals and 

treatment centers of the most modern kind, and in 

these circumstances, there will be a handful of people 

who pose a threat to themselves or others, in which 

case they must be restrained. 

There might be due process problems, whether 

you have the right person, whether they should be 

restrained, et cetera. But doesn't the Constitution 

give authority to the Federal Government to set up a 

system of mental illness prevention and cure, if in 

fact they determine that that's a desirable use of 

Federal money? 

MR. DUBOIS: No, Justice Breyer, I don't 

think the Federal Government has that power. 

JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't have the power 

to set up hospitals? 

MR. DUBOIS: It doesn't have the power to 

detain individuals as a result of their mental illness

doctors were to say, there are a thousand people here 

suffering from mental illness, your own daughter or 

mine or someone has a -- is threatening suicide or 

threatening murder? There are lots of real cases like 

that, where people have terrible times, and there are 

not adequate State facilities. And were the Federal 

Government to say, this is a problem that we wish to 

go into and help with, you are saying the Constitution 

prohibits that? Where does it prohibit it? 

MR. DUBOIS: Well, I think -- I think that 

would not be a very large extension, if it’s an 

extension at all, of the holding in Morrison, that the 

Federal Government could not do that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Try the Tenth Amendment.

proposition that if -- if the incarceration causes a 

problem, then the Federal Government has the power, 

ancillary to the power to operate the -- the criminal 

justice system, to remedy the problems that it has 

caused by the incarceration?

power is addressed by statute --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't hear. You think 

they have a power to --

MR. DUBOIS: They have a power, but it's not 

an unlimited power. There is a statute, 4245, which 

allows the government to transfer an individual who 

becomes ill while in the custody of the Bureau of 

Prisons, to a psychiatric facility for care and 

treatment. Now, by the terms of that statute, 

however, that commitment must end at the end of their 

sentence, and I think that would be the extent of the 

government's power.

any prisoner would take that deal. They would rather 

be treated in the community. So it becomes a question 

of whether the person can be held for the safety of 

others, and again, I think the answer is no. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if the person is 

simply injured in prison as a result of, let's say, an 

attack by another prisoner, and now the sentence 

expires. The Federal Government has no power to set 

up hospitals or facilities to care for that person for 

the duration of the -- of the injury that’s -- that 

was caused during the period of incarceration? 

MR. DUBOIS: Your Honor, I think the Federal 

Government would have no power to do that. The --

while the individual is in the custody of the Bureau 

of Prisons, the Federal Government does have a limited 

parens patriae power to see to their care and 

treatment. 

Now, I think we are getting a little bit far 

afield from the, you know, indefinite, potential 

lifetime detention at issue here and whether, under 

doctor's orders, the -- tells the person, well, you 

ought to stay in the hospital for an extra week so

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, of course, that goes 

to -- that goes to the question of the wisdom of the 

statute. I think, as the case comes to us, we have to 

assume that there are cases out there in which there 

will be no solution such as the one Justice Scalia 

proposes. 

MR. DUBOIS: Well, I don't know --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I think that's why 

Congress acted, because they think there are such 

cases. 

MR. DUBOIS: Well, I don't know that you can 

make that assumption, and to the extent that the --

the fear is that the State will decline 

responsibility, I do not think that Federal power can 

expand or contract based on a State's willingness or 

unwillingness to accept a responsibility --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But we are asked to decide 

a question on the assumption that there are States and 

there are governors who will not react to the problem 

of particular prisoners who are released in Arizona or 

some place when they originally came from Michigan or 

whatever it is. I think we have to assume that there 

are cases in which the statute would -- would play a 

role. 

MR. DUBOIS: Well, Your Honor -- Your Honor,

I think that may be right, but there -- but there are 

-- the question is: What's a constitutional response 

to that problem? We can imagine plenty of 

unconstitutional responses. For instance, a person --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Absolutely, and that's why 

it seems to me that the constitutional answer is the 

same in this statute as in the case of somebody who 

incurs a very communicable disease and the government 

wants to prevent him from infecting the community. 

Why is it a different constitutional question? 

MR. DUBOIS: Well, I think the different 

constitutional question is -- again, I do not believe 

the Federal government has a general quarantine power 

that doesn't -- that would allow it to hold prisoners 

past their release date. 

I think that is a public health problem, 

except for -- to the extent that there may be a closer 

nexus to a forward-looking Commerce Clause hook that 

doesn't exist in this case. The government's argument 

is purely backwards looking. They -- they locate the 

power to commit --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand. It's purely 

backwards looking, and it takes care of the case that 

-- the premise of the government's argument is that 

the release itself is a Federal act that has to be

done responsibly, and the very release, if it causes 

harm to the community, can be prevented. 

MR. DUBOIS: And it seems to me that the 

government's argument essentially collapses into the 

notion, well, if it's a good idea, it must be 

necessary and proper to do it. I think that’s just 

simply not correct. It's very -- we're going --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's more than the 

question of good idea. You’re talking about 

endangering the health and safety of people, so it's ­

-

MR. DUBOIS: Well, there --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The government has some 

responsibility, doesn't it? 

MR. DUBOIS: Absolutely, the government --

the government has a responsibility, but they have 

certain constitutional limits that also must be 

respected. So the statute --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you say, if the 

State is unwilling to take the person, and apparently, 

that is the problem that precipitated 4246 and, now, 

4248, and that -- you -- the Federal government is 

just helpless short of passing a spending measure and 

saying, State, if you do this, we’ll give you the 

money.

MR. DUBOIS: Right. And -- and -- well, I 

think there’s -- there’s a number of weapons in the 

Federal Government's arsenal. First of all, there’s 

the Federal spending power. Second of all, there is 

already, in the statute of 4042, a specific duty to 

warn, just as Justice Scalia was positing. It already 

exists. 

Any time the Federal Government is going to 

release a person they believe to be violent or 

dangerous, they are required to warn the attorney 

general of the State within a certain period of time 

before their release. 

At that point, I do believe it becomes a 

problem of the State polity. If the State governor is 

going to be cavalier about that type of release, then 

I think the answer for that lies in the voters of that 

State, to say, no, we want you to take this problem 

seriously and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he's not going 

to be cavalier. He doesn’t have -- he's going to say: 

Don't do it. This is a dangerous person, the Federal 

government; don't release him. 

MR. DUBOIS: And he's going to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you want the 

Federal Government to have to be in the position of

saying, well, we have to. 

MR. DUBOIS: Exactly. The Federal 

Government has to, and at that point, the State must 

make that hard political decision. Do we want to take 

this person on, spend the money necessary to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it may be the 

Federal Government's hard political position. They 

are the person holding them, and the attorney general 

is saying, don't release him, and then the Federal 

government is going to make the decision, well, we 

have to. 

MR. DUBOIS: And so, in that sense, it’s no 

decision at all because the Constitution requires that 

they be released. 

JUSTICE BREYER: The -- go back once more 

because I am obviously getting nowhere with this, but 

I thought that, if you set up a set of hospitals, as I 

think the government could do, there will be a few 

people, sometimes, who have to be restrained in those 

hospitals for themselves or others’ benefit. 

If you set up a system of mental hospitals, 

that's even more true. If you set up a university, 

some people will be sick, and they will be in the 

infirmary, and occasionally, you will come across a 

person who has to be restrained, et cetera.

Now, once you are down the road where you 

admit the government can do that, how is a prison any 

different? 

MR. DUBOIS: Well, I --

JUSTICE BREYER: You set up a prison where, 

in fact, occasionally, people have to be restrained 

for health reasons, et cetera, and just as in the 

other cases, sometimes that can last past the normal 

release date, so can it in prison. 

Maybe there's a better way, but why isn't 

this just a normal part of running this institution, 

just as it is in the other cases? 

MR. DUBOIS: Well, we'll just start -- I 

think, a couple of responses. First of all, this is ­

- that is no part of the government's argument in this 

case. Their -- their argument is a backward-looking 

argument that locates its power in the fact that they 

have had these people in their custody, and they can't 

responsibly let them go. 

What you are positing is more of a forward­

looking argument that would essentially create a 

Federal parens patriae power, that the Federal 

government has --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not, actually. I'm 

just showing you the connection between running an

institution, which, for whatever set of reasons in the 

Constitution, you have the authority to do, and then 

it becomes, as part of that institution, part of the 

job to take care of people in a certain way. 

Sometimes that requires a restraint, and 

sometimes that restraint could last beyond the period 

where in the absence of that need the person would no 

longer be part of the institution. That's true of a 

hospital, of a mental hospital, and of a prison. 

Whether they rest on the same power or a different 

power, the government has the power, Federal, to 

establish all of those institutions. 

I'm just drawing institutional connections. 

That's -- that's what I'm saying. Maybe that's an 

unnecessarily complex argument, but I was just seeing 

it that way. 

MR. DUBOIS: Well, it -- it is complex, 

Justice Breyer, and it’s also, I think, historically ­

- the Federal Government has not historically thought 

to have been able to have the sort of general parens 

patriae power that -- that the States do enjoy to take 

care of the health and well-being of its citizens. I 

think it would be quite a step for the Federal 

Government to embark on an enterprise of that nature.

involuntary commitment procedures? 

MR. DUBOIS: Every State does, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, couldn't the Federal 

Government fund a Federal -- would you find a 

constitutional problem in the Federal Government 

funding an office which brings involuntary commitment 

proceedings in a State where a prisoner is released 

when the Federal Government believes --

MR. DUBOIS: There would have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the prisoner is unsafe? 

MR. DUBOIS: There would be absolutely no 

problem with that, Your Honor. The Congress, with 

spending power, would have clear ability to fund that 

type of program run -- run and administered by the 

States. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And I presume the State 

couldn't -- if the -- if the Court says commitment is 

proper, the State would have to accept the commitment, 

no? 

MR. DUBOIS: Yes, absolutely, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So why don't they do that? 

MR. DUBOIS: They should do that. I mean, 

what they are doing here is what they can't do. Just

of a lot of different statutes Congress might have 

enacted. We have to decide whether this one is 

constitutional. 

MR. DUBOIS: And, Your Honor, I think that’s 

absolutely right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but most of the 

argument for why this is constitutional is simply it's 

necessary, and therefore it's constitutional. But I'm 

not even sure it's necessary. 

MR. DUBOIS: Well, I think that's right, 

Your Honor. 

And to answer your question, Justice 

Stevens, you are absolutely right. And I think there 

-- there are many tools that Congress has at its 

disposal to address this problem. The spending power 

is one. Every one of these individuals would be on 

Federal supervised release. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, that's one of the 

things that you mention in your brief. You said you 

could vary the conditions of supervised release, but 

you were not at all specific about that. You said the 

Federal Government -- the person has gotten out, they 

know the person is dangerous, so what -- what are the 

measures that they would take to do what you said in 

the brief the Federal Government could do; that is,

set the terms of supervised release in order to 

account for sexual dangerousness? 

MR. DUBOIS: Well, the first thing they can 

do is act as a liaison between the individual and the 

State. Every one of these individuals will have a 

Federal probation officer who will be responsible for 

their supervision during the period of supervised 

release. They also have the ability to go back to the 

court of conviction and seek modifications of the 

terms of supervised release, that they have certain 

concerns --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what would the 

modification be? 

MR. DUBOIS: Those modifications could 

include things like mandating mental health treatment 

during the term of supervised release, certain 

limitations on travel, certain limitations on 

activities with computers. A fairly large range of --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that doesn't take 

care of the fact that the prisoner would be released 

before there was a cure found for the alleged mental 

illness, meaning supervised release generally has a 

term limit. 

MR. DUBOIS: That's correct, Your Honor.

to do something before the release is addressed by 

4042, which is the duty to warn statute. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could -- what would 

happen if Congress said, as part of a sentence, a 

judge could incorporate a civil commitment finding and 

say: You are going to serve X amount in jail and Y 

amount, and then we are going to civilly commit you 

indefinitely, because as of today, I am finding you a 

sexual predator subject to a mental illness. 

Would that be constitutional, and if not, 

why not? 

MR. DUBOIS: Well, that would not be 

constitutional, Justice Sotomayor, because of the 

indefinite nature of the commitment. You can envision 

a system -- and we had that type of system in the 

'50s, '60s, and '70s -- of indeterminate sentencing, 

where --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I -- let's assume 

it incorporates all the protections of -- of this 

statute with respect to periodic review. 

MR. DUBOIS: So if we have an indeterminate­

type sentence where you -- you get a sentence of 10 

years and you are periodically reviewed to see if you 

are safe to be released, of course that’s 

constitutional.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Because it’s 

MR. DUBOIS: It's a part of the sentence. 

It's part of the punishment for the crime which 

brought you into custody. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, so that would be 

true whether or not you were convicted of a sex crime 

or a tax crime or any other crime, so long as the 

judge was making a finding that this was necessary to 

protect the public? 

MR. DUBOIS: Sure. A judge -- whether you 

are being sentenced for bank robbery or -- or some 

sort of sexual offense, the judge can take into 

account the whole of your criminal history in 

determining what you are being sentenced for, but you 

are still only being sentenced for the crime for which 

you are convicted. And that would be cabined by the 

varying statutory maxes for each specific offense. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right --

MR. DUBOIS: That's why in this case it’s --

is, then, that the nexus is -- the nexus with the need 

for the criminal justice system or the proper and 

necessary power to address this problem ends at the 

point of sentencing, is what you’re saying? 

MR. DUBOIS: That's correct, Your Honor. At 

that point the enumerated power which supported the 

crime has been fully effectuated. It has been 

exhausted. There is no further backward-looking 

Federal power to be vindicated under Article I. 

Now, there may be a forward-looking power. 

If there is one, the government hasn't identified it. 

But that's where the constitutional justification 

would have to be found in this case. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it says that it 

exists as a result of its control over this 

individual, its special relationship, and the fact 

that at the end of the sentence, it has an obligation 

to the public. 

MR. DUBOIS: And -- and that really is, I 

think, historically, sort of an anomalous argument in 

the sense that civil commitment has never been thought 

to be part of the criminal justice system. They are 

two separate spheres of government control and 

government authority. And while they may intersect at 

the State level, a State doesn't civilly commit its

commits these people based on their parens patriae and 

general police powers. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about someone who is 

incompetent to stand trial? I take it you think that 

that’s a perfectly proper application of 4246? 

MR. DUBOIS: I believe that is correct. I 

think under Greenwood that type of commitment is 

appropriate. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does it matter that the 

person who has been found incompetent to stand trial 

has now been in custody for three times longer than 

the maximum sentence? 

MR. DUBOIS: I do not think that that is 

constitutionally significant, because -- well, there's 

a couple of reasons. But the first reason is, again, 

you have a direct link to the unexhausted power. The 

power to prosecute still exists, and the government's 

interest only isn’t the interest in punishment; the 

government does have an interest in obtaining a 

conviction, which is still alive. And if the person 

does restore -- regain competency to the extent that 

he can be tried, he can be convicted. Even if he 

cannot be -- he cannot be punished any further, he

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though it may be 

purely imaginary; that is, that this particular 

person, all of the experts agree, will never be 

competent to stand trial. 

MR. DUBOIS: And I think that was the -- the 

logic or the trade-off in Greenwood, which was that we 

were not going to require courts to make finely 

grained determinations about whether or not this 

person or that person might regain competency, and 

just decide to have a simpler test that commitment is 

appropriate as long as the Federal Government's 

interest has not been exhausted or vindicated. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Could you explain why the 

constitutional power that provides the basis for a 

Federal criminal conviction is exhausted at the end of 

the -- either the maximum term of imprisonment that 

Congress chooses to establish when it enacts the 

statute or at the end of the particular term that is 

given to this prisoner? 

I understand why it's relevant for statutory 

purposes. It may be relevant for other constitutional 

purposes -- double jeopardy and due process -- but why 

as a -- why does the power, the Commerce Clause power,

the power to make rules for Federal property and so 

forth, why is that exhausted at the end of the --

either of those two periods? I don't quite understand 

that. 

MR. DUBOIS: Well, I think the reason, Your 

Honor, is that at the time of conviction and sentence, 

the interest in -- the official regulation of 

interstate commerce, say, has been vindicated by this 

person's conviction for doing an activity which 

Congress has judged to be interfering with interstate 

commerce. And that --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, only to the extent 

that that's what the statute says. Take whatever the 

offense is, would it be a violation of the Necessary 

and Proper Clause? Let's say it's a commerce -- it's 

based on the Commerce Clause. Would Congress exceed 

it's powers under the Commerce Clause if it imposed a 

sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility 

of parole? 

I mean it raises other constitutional 

questions, but why does it raise a question as to the 

extent of the power that’s being exercised by -- by 

Congress? 

MR. DUBOIS: Well, Your Honor, I think 

Congress does have almost unlimited authority to set

statutory maximums for different crimes based on their 

estimation of the severity of the crime. I -- I don't 

see that that causes a problem. The problem here is 

that there is no necessary connection between the --

say, the regulation of interstate commerce and the 

desire to prevent primarily local sex offences. It's 

very difficult to say how preventing general, State­

type violent crimes has anything to do with the 

regulation of interstate commerce. And that's what 

this --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there is -- there is 

in the sense that the relation between the prisoner 

and his or her State is disrupted for, say, 15 years, 

and then this person is just a derelict. 

MR. DUBOIS: Well, I really think that that 

argument the government raises is a bit of a red 

herring. I have been practicing as a Federal defender 

for a very long time. I have never yet had a 

defendant where the Bureau of Prisons didn’t know 

where to send them. And there has never been a case 

where a defendant did not have a State to go to, and ­

place of conviction, which is probably about 90 

percent of the time their home State, anyway. But if 

-- if they are from a different home State, generally 

the Bureau of Prisons tries to come up with a release 

plan to release them to their State of domicile. And 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I want to follow up on 

Justice Alito's question. Supposing Congress passed a 

statute that said at the expiration of every sentence, 

the prisoner shall examined for certain reasons, and 

if he fails certain tests, he shall not be released 

for another 30 days. Say he should be examined to 

determine whether he is a sexual predator. And that’s 

in every -- every sentence at the time of the 

sentence? 

MR. DUBOIS: And every -- and then, 

following that examination, they could be then 

detained indefinitely? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. And it says so in 

the statute. 

MR. DUBOIS: I do not think that that would 

be constitutional, Your Honor, because it still would 

have to be part of the punishment for the crime.

JUSTICE STEVENS: One of the elements of the 

punishment is that you are subjected to this 

examination that otherwise you wouldn’t have to take. 

It seems to me maybe your case boils down to the fact 

that -- that Congress hasn't written the right 

statute. 

MR. DUBOIS: We do not know that this 

statute cannot be written constitutionally. All we 

know is this statute is not written constitutionally, 

because it is effectively unlimited. It effectively 

does require no connection between the underlying 

criminal charge and the subsequent commitment. You 

can be in custody for any crime whatsoever. It 

doesn't have to be sex-related. You can never have 

been convicted of a sex offense whatsoever. 

So it really is -- there’s almost a complete 

de-linking of the crime which brought you into Federal 

custody and your subsequent commitment. Can we 

imagine hypotheticals that -- that create a link, that 

rolls it into the punishment? Perhaps, but that’s not 

this statute, and this statute must fail for that 

reason. 

If there’s no further questions, Your Honor, 

I thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

General Kagan, you have 3 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

GENERAL KAGAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice. 

What Congress said here was something pretty 

simple and very reasonable. It said if we, the 

Federal Government, have somebody in our custody, and 

we know that that person has the kind of mental 

illness that’s going to cause grave danger to the 

community, and we know that there is no one else who 

is in a good position to prevent it, and we know that 

we are in part responsible for that vacuum, then we 

should be able to do something about it. That's what 

section 4248 says, and section 4248 is constitutional 

for that reason. 

Justice Scalia has several times suggested 

that maybe there is no experience of this, but I think 

that the facts of the Judicial Conference Committee 

report, stating that there were these problems with 

respect to mentally ill people generally, rebuts that. 

So, too, this Court's view in Shannon, that section 

4243 was necessary because there was a gaping 

statutory hole where States were not willing to step

forward, rebuts that as well. 

In fact, it is not and has never been the 

case that the test here is whether a government action 

is absolutely necessary to aid or effect a 

governmental or congressional power. The wisdom of 

the statute here is not what’s at issue: Maybe this 

is the right statute; maybe there might be a better 

one. The only question is the constitutionality of 

the statute. That sort of wisdom, whether there might 

be a better statute, that's for Congress to decide. 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General. 

Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
