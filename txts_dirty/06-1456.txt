 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument first 

today in Case 06-1456, Cuellar versus United States. 

Mr. Beard.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERRY V. BEARD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BEARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 Section 1956, the money laundering statute, 

requires an intent to minimize the criminal taint of 

unlawful proceeds. But the statute does not criminalize 

concealing money's existence. In this case, 

Mr. Cuellar's conviction should be reversed for two 

reasons. First, while the method of the transportation 

involved may have been designed to conceal, the 

transportation itself was not. Secondly, while Cuellar 

may have in fact concealed money itself, he did not 

conceal the nature, source, location, ownership or 

control of the unlawful proceeds.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he certainly 

concealed the location. They were secreted in the car, 

under the goat hair and everything else. The location 

of the money was certainly concealed.

 MR. BEARD: Chief Justice, in the broader

sense location was concealed. The point to be taken 

here I think is this: An examination of the text itself 

reveals particular listed attributes, and location 

numbers among them. But what this suggests, the 

requirement that there be a design to conceal or to 

disguise these particular attributes, necessarily means 

a plan, if you will, for those -- excuse me -- for those 

attributes to be presented either to law enforcement if 

they intercept the money or inject it into legitimate 

commerce later. In other words, they'll be observed 

later. Location has independent meaning, but it's also 

understood within the context of the words that surround 

it. All money changes location, whether concealed or 

not. Location in this context means more than the 

location that the money was found in the car.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe I should ask you this 

now because you've probably thought about it and I can't 

work it out. I don't see any problem with the word 

"location." I thought what you would say is it isn't 

the transportation in this instance that concealed the 

location, it's the method of transportation that sealed 

the location.

 MR. BEARD: Yes, Justice --

JUSTICE BREYER: And if you read it that 

literally, then there is no problem in getting to your

interpretation of the statute, or is there? Because 

since you didn't advance that argument, I thought maybe 

there's something I've not seen here.

 MR. BEARD: No, Justice Breyer; you're 

correct. There is a huge difference between the method 

of transportation and the transportation itself. And in 

this particular case, the difference is certainly 

implicated. What we understand the government to be 

arguing is that the method of the transportation 

signifies the listed attributes. But if that were the 

case it would effectively render all transportation of 

funds necessarily to be money laundering.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask, what do 

you mean by method of transportation in this case? I 

mean, that it was in a car or the fact it was wrapped up 

in dirty -- in a dirty kind of container, and so forth 

and so on?

 MR. BEARD: Justice Stevens, what I'm 

referring to is certainly that it was in a car, but 

there was a secret compartment, goat hair was sprinkled 

around to try to throw off drug detection dogs, and 

those type of characteristics.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't that all just 

evidence that there was a motive to conceal the 

ownership?

MR. BEARD: No, I don't think so, 

Justice Stevens. What we're looking at here is that the 

design of the -- the fact Mr. Cuellar may or may not 

have known, for example, who owned -- where the money 

was coming from or who owned it, that doesn't go to the 

design of the transportation. The design of the 

transportation itself is just to get the money to 

Mexico. I can say that abstractly, but in this case in 

particular because we know from the government's 

evidence that what this was was essentially the last leg 

of a drug trafficking deal. We know that this was 

repayment. So in this particular case at least, the 

purpose of this transportation was to get this money 

back as repayment money.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If he were a courier 

bringing the marijuana into the United States what would 

be the crime and the penalty?

 MR. BEARD: Justice, if he was bringing --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If he was bringing 

marijuana into the United States instead of returning 

with the proceeds?

 MR. BEARD: Well, presumably, Your Honor, it 

would be a drug trafficking crime. But of course, as I 

understand your hypothetical, he would possess marijuana 

at that time.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But now he possesses 

money. And you're not saying this is innocent behavior. 

It is criminal behavior, so what is the crime if not 

money laundering?

 MR. BEARD: We have suggested that 

Mr. Cuellar's, liability, liability or culpability, lie 

more properly under the bulk cash smuggling statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that requires knowing 

that it's illegal to take out more than X amount of 

money, and there's nothing that indicates that the 

common courier would know anything about such a 

provision.

 MR. BEARD: Yes, you're correct that it 

would require inference as opposed to direct evidence. 

This is why in our reply brief, we gave an example of 

where the identical type behavior arose, not in Texas 

but in Alabama, and in fact the individual pleaded 

guilty to bulk cash smuggling.

 So I suppose my response would be this. The 

same weak inferences that supported the money laundering 

conviction in the government's eyes would be the same 

inferences that would support the cash smuggling.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we take it that you 

concede -- I don't want to say that you concede. If we 

take it the government has a strong case under the

smuggling statute, wouldn't it have an equally strong 

case under (i) of the statute that we're considering 

here, which doesn't require concealing or disguising the 

nature, just to avoid a transportation reporting 

requirement. That's the same as the smuggling statute.

 MR. BEARD: No, I don't think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I know the government 

didn't indict under (ii).

 MR. BEARD: But I don't think it is the 

same, Your Honor, because the cash smuggling, the bulk 

cash smuggling statute, speaks to currency and of course 

this speaks to transactions. So I think that there 

is in fact --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean as the proceeds 

of an illegal transaction?

 MR. BEARD: Well, I'm distinguishing between 

currency and transaction because as I understand it at 

least transaction might implicate in a banking context, 

but cash is cash, if you will. So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it doesn't matter for 

purposes of the bulk cash statute that it was illegal. 

It could be perfectly lawful money.

 MR. BEARD: Yes, Your Honor, absolutely. 

That's certainly true.

this transporting to conceal the location or the 

ownership in this sense? Suppose you have someone the 

police suspect of engaging in drug activities. They 

know he sold, you know, so much marijuana or whatever 

and got cash back. They think it's there, and they're 

going to investigate it, but this fellow comes in and 

they transport the proceeds across the border.

 Isn't that transportation to conceal the 

location or the ownership?

 MR. BEARD: As I understand it, Mr. Chief 

Justice, if the police are aware of it and then the 

flush, if you will, takes the money across, I think 

that's -- that's much closer. That's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they think 

it's there, but they're not sure, and they -- you know, 

that would help them make their case, to find out that 

the guy they think sold the drugs has $80,000. So they 

get a search warrant or whatever, and it turns out he 

doesn't, because it's been transported to conceal the 

location or ownership.

 MR. BEARD: I would -- no, I think that 

the -- if the police were aware, if the police were 

aware and the kingpin were aware and put in place some 

type of design, if you will, to flush the money and 

perhaps to -- to Mexico under the circumstances you

described, then you would be closer to, to having money 

laundering liability, although certainly I don't know 

that the courier necessarily would.

 However, I think it's very important to 

consider that the money laundering statute necessarily 

contemplates this notion of -- of detection or the money 

resurfacing, if you will. And the reason I think that's 

important is because it gives a particular meaning to 

those listed attributes. If the police were just --

well, in this case, just stumbled upon it, and nothing 

was -- had been done and there was no evidence on the 

record to suggest that there was going to be anything 

done in this case other than repayment, money laundering 

liability is simply not going to arise.

 Now, I think that --

JUSTICE BREYER: I still don't see why isn't 

what the Chief Justice said absolutely right? If you 

are transporting this money to get it out of town so the 

police can't find it, you're transporting it to conceal 

it. That falls right within the statute.

 MR. BEARD: I --

JUSTICE BREYER: If you're transporting it 

simply to pay some courier somewhere else, you're not 

transporting it to conceal it. And if in fact the 

transportation is done in a way that conceals it, that's

beside the point because the statute is interested in 

transporting it in order to conceal it.

 MR. BEARD: I think that --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is wrong with that?

 MR. BEARD: I think what's wrong, Your 

Honor, is that the -- the statute focuses on the 

transportation or some of the other transfers of 

transmission and specifically is coupled, if you will, 

with this notion of -- of the attributes themselves. I 

don't know that it's -- it's simply too broad, in fact, 

to say that all transportation's will necessarily incur 

the money laundering liability.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- maybe I don't 

understand the -- I thought he was helping you, but 

maybe --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Were you helping him? I 

thought so.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It sounds like he was 

making the distinction that didn't the dissenting judge 

make between -- the dissenting judge says transporting 

to conceal is no good, but concealing to transport is 

okay.

 MR. BEARD: That -- you're correct, Your

Honor, and that is, I think, a point to be made. The --

Judge Smith below did try to highlight the fact that if 

you transport to conceal, then you're beginning to 

implicate money laundering liability.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose someone transports 

money across a border and is recorded surreptitiously on 

tape explaining exactly why the person did it, and the 

person says: The reason why I'm transporting this 

across the border is because I know that when I get it 

to the destination country, that's a place where people 

use huge amounts of cash for bank deposits, for 

purchases; and, therefore the act of transporting it 

from the United States to the other country will 

disguise the nature of the cash as drug money.

 Would that fall within the statute?

 MR. BEARD: No, I don't think so, 

Justice Alito, and the reason I don't is because that 

-- what you've described implicates potential money 

spending, this notion that the money is easier spent. 

But without more, money spending would not equate to 

money laundering. That's --

JUSTICE ALITO: Why wouldn't that fit the 

literal language of the statute? It's a transportation 

across the board with the design to conceal the nature, 

i.e., that it's drug money, of this money?

MR. BEARD: I'm not sure, Justice, that 

you've actually concealed the nature. If the money was 

going -- if the money was dirty and going across dirty, 

it remained dirty and just happened to be spent. But --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but it doesn't remain 

dirty simply because it goes to a place in which the 

appearance of this kind of cash does not have the dirty 

appearance that it does at home. Why -- why isn't 

that the correct answer?

 MR. BEARD: I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why doesn't that make it 

laundering?

 MR. BEARD: Again, I don't know that there 

has been -- as I understood the hypothetical, I don't 

think that there's been any suggestion of a design to 

conceal, the why. You're just taking dirty and you're 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the design to 

conceal -- maybe I misunderstood the hypo, but I thought 

the design to conceal was you conceal the dirty 

character of the money by taking it to a place and using 

it in that place where use of large amounts of cash, 

whether for bank deposits or spending in luxury stores, 

does not have the dirty implication, the dirty 

appearance that it does in the United States.

So, why doesn't that therefore satisfy the 

concealment?

 MR. BEARD: I -- Justice Souter, I think 

that the answer to the question is here. The statute is 

designed to take -- or purposed to take these dirty 

proceeds, unlawful proceeds, and to cleanse them so as 

to prevent their injection into streams of legitimate 

commerce.

 What you've described as spending is 

admittedly spending, but I don't think that the spending 

that's -- that you've contemplated there basically 

implicates the core concern, if you will. The money --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have any evidence 

like that here anyway, do we? Do we know that this was 

going to "Spendy Land" where everybody has a lot of 

money? Did we know that?

 MR. BEARD: Justice Scalia, what we know, 

because the government's evidence established it, is 

that the money was being sent back to Mexico to repay 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Does everybody have a lot 

of money in Mexico? Is that --

MR. BEARD: Well, I would hazard to say no, 

of course, but the record --

evidence about the nature of the Mexican economy?

 MR. BEARD: There was. There was, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What was the evidence?

 MR. BEARD: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE ALITO: What was the evidence?

 MR. BEARD: The evidence that you just asked 

about went to that it was easier to spend money in 

Mexico.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Wasn't there an expert who 

said that Mexico has a cash economy?

 MR. BEARD: Yes, yes. And it -- and --

JUSTICE ALITO: And what does that mean?

 MR. BEARD: What I take it to mean --

JUSTICE ALITO: Does it mean people can 

spend a lot of cash without raising eyebrows?

 MR. BEARD: Certainly more than here. That 

was what I think that the evidence was offered for. And 

the same expert, of course offered, you know, 

established -- or the government established through the 

same expert that the purpose of this particular 

transportation was to complete the transaction, the drug 

transaction.

 JUSTICE ALITO: In your brief, you argue 

that there has to be a design to create the appearance

of legitimate wealth. Are you drawing back now from 

that argument?

 MR. BEARD: No, and, of course, we are well 

aware that those words are not found in the statute, nor 

do we suggest that they were. But what we have 

suggested is simply that that's, if you will, shorthand 

for describing what necessarily occurs if the 

attributes, the listed attributes, are obfuscated. That 

is the cleansing mechanism.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why would that be so? 

Suppose -- I mean, just take -- modify my hypothetical. 

What this person says on the tape is: I'm sending this 

money across the border because I know that if it --

once it gets there, it will be harder to establish my 

ownership of it. People will still know that it's drug 

money perhaps, but they -- it will be harder to 

establish my ownership of it.

 Now, would that fall within the statute?

 MR. BEARD: Well, at that point, yes, 

because I think --

JUSTICE ALITO: But there wouldn't be an 

attempt to create the appearance of legitimate wealth 

there then, would there?

 MR. BEARD: Well, to the extent that the 

individual who has been taped is contemplating the

money's resurfacing, I think that there would be. It 

would be not legitimate wealth, though. And perhaps I 

need to drive this point home. It would be less dirty. 

In other words, there's not a requirement that the dirty 

money necessarily be made clean or a description, but 

that the dirty money be made less dirty. And that I 

think is -- is what we're talking about.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does the statutory purpose 

have to be the only purpose or the principal purpose? I 

mean, I could conceive that the principal purpose of 

this transportation was to give the money back to the 

fellow who gave the drugs, to pay the provider of the 

drugs. I assume that would be the principal purpose.

 But what if you know that when the -- when 

the provider of the drugs is paid, he'll be able to 

spend this cash easily in Mexico, which has a cash 

economy? And let's assume that the latter is enough to 

satisfy the purpose requirement of this statute. What 

-- what would be the result?

 MR. BEARD: If we -- well, Justice Scalia, 

if we --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If you assume a primary 

purpose to pay off the --

MR. BEARD: Right. If we assume that the --

that the latter, as you just said, satisfies the

statute, then you have a conviction.

 But we certainly don't assume that, because 

that implicates money spending, and money spending 

hasn't -- hasn't been held to be money laundering.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though that wasn't the 

real purpose -- I mean, the real purpose was to pay off 

this fellow, who otherwise might come to hurt you.

 MR. BEARD: Yes, absolutely.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But once you do pay him 

off, you know that the money is going to be ready 

spendable.

 MR. BEARD: Well, certainly in this case, we 

don't have any evidence that Mr. Cuellar knew any such 

thing. If you were to remove it from the confines of 

the Cuellar case, I think you -- your hypothetical does 

come closer to implicating liability; but that's simply 

not what we have here, at least.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Now, what you understand 

the language "disguise the nature of the proceeds of 

this specified unlawful activity" to mean, does that --

is that satisfied by merely proof that it is proceeds of 

unlawful activity? Or do you have to tell that -- what 

is the word "nature" talking about?

 MR. BEARD: No, Justice Stevens. It would 

again, I think, require more. If all that were required

is to show that there was unlawful proceeds --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that's what it seems 

to say. What I'm asking is: What do you think it 

means?

 MR. BEARD: Well, what I think it means is 

that there has to be some -- the transportation or what 

have you has to be purposed, designed, to take the 

nature and obfuscate it. And this --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But I'm just asking about 

the word -- the meaning of the word "nature." What is 

the nature, other than the fact it's proceeds of 

unlawful activity?

 MR. BEARD: That it would -- I think that it 

would -- "nature" is perhaps the first and foremost of 

the attributes, but I think that it means, that it means 

dirty, unclean.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: "Dirty" in some sense 

other than being proceeds of specified unlawful 

activity?

 MR. BEARD: Oh, okay. I don't know.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I just don't know what 

that means other than that it is proceeds of unlawful --

attributes and contemplate --

one attribute, "nature."

 MR. BEARD: Right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm trying to understand 

what you think that means.

 MR. BEARD: I have thought of it as meaning 

basically dirty.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Proceeds of unlawful 

activity.

 MR. BEARD: Proceeds of unlawful activity 

are the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's always dirty.

 MR. BEARD: There may be -- well, yes, I see 

where you're going. Is there -- what is the independent 

meaning of "nature." I think that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't it simply to 

change the nature from being drug money to look like 

it's apparently innocent? I mean the change of the 

nature -- the nature going in is it's always dirty. 

It's drug money. And the purpose of the concealment is 

to get it converted to some different nature, i.e., 

clean money.

 Isn't that what "disguise the nature" means?

 MR. BEARD: I don't -- I brook no quarrel 

with that. I mean, yes. I'm just -- what I was simply 

suggesting --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the verb is not 

"transformed." The verb is "disguise" or "conceal."

 MR. BEARD: That's true, and the meaning 

certainly of "conceal" would be to bring it forward with 

maybe no explanation of the taint, if you will. And, of 

course, "disguise" would be to maybe create a false 

explanation of where the money is --

requirement for -- for this shipment. If he had gone to

JUSTICE KENNEDY: To avoid a 

transaction-reporting requirement, and you wouldn't have 

to go through all this "nature" thing.

he would have a currency-reporting requirement, had he 

been going South.

is such a requirement.

requirement, yes. I'm not sure that there is a

considerations.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if he -- if he didn't 

know about the currency-reporting requirement, then he's 

not guilty under that statute because it requires 

knowledge.

 MR. BEARD: Yes, Your Honor, I understand. 

And so where we are left is he may not be guilty under 

money laundering and perhaps, perhaps not under bulk 

cash smuggling. But that in itself does not necessitate 

a broadly interpreted understanding of the money 

laundering statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If he's not -- if he 

doesn't fit into either category, then there's no crime?

 MR. BEARD: That's a possibility, yes, 

absolutely.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, can I ask 

you to go back to Justice Stevens's line of questioning? 

If -- do you conceal the nature of proceeds if you 

conceal the proceeds?

 MR. BEARD: No, and I think that --

Mr. Chief Justice, I think that it's important to 

understand, for example, that hiding money is not 

necessarily the same thing as -- I mean, concealing

money is not necessarily the same thing as concealing 

the location. And I think you could make the same type 

of analysis in the other --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that -- that 

doesn't seem to follow. I understand the argument with 

"nature." In other words, you're not concealing the 

nature; it's just not there. But when you're hiding it, 

you are concealing the location.

 MR. BEARD: Yes. But, again, I think that 

the term "location," which is understood in the context 

of the words surrounding it, if I take money and hide it 

in my --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that gets me 

to a question. Several times you've referenced the 

attributes. Are you saying that the statute would have 

a different meaning if it just said "location"?

 MR. BEARD: What I'm suggesting, Chief 

Justice, is that if the -- that the statute would have a 

particularly different meaning from the one that the 

government wants if the attributes just listed existence 

of the money. There is a huge difference between hiding 

money or hiding the location of the money.

 If you just had location by itself, I'd be 

making the same argument; but there's a huge difference 

between hiding money or hiding the location.

 MR. BEARD: All right, then. If I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because they seem to 

me the same.

 MR. BEARD: If I -- no. I think that the --

hiding the location suggests that the individual is 

contemplating the money resurfacing later, either for 

injection into commerce or for -- perhaps if the police 

discover it, and they're trying -- the launderer, if you 

will, is trying to make sure that the money would 

survive that subsequent --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, so hiding 

location assumes it's going to come up later.

 MR. BEARD: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if you just hide 

the money, you assume he's just going to leave it 

somewhere and forget about it?

 MR. BEARD: No. No, Mr. Chief Justice. If 

you just hide the money, that would encompass just 

hiding money, for example, in the back yard of your 

house with -- with -- or in a tin can or under a 

mattress or whatever. It's a much broader -- broader 

concept.

 And I think that that's really what is at

play here because, to the extent that the government is 

focusing on the method or -- of the concealment here, 

they're -- they're implicating that type of behavior, if 

you will, and saying it's sufficient to support a money 

laundering conviction.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But what if there is a wire 

transfer to a bank in another country because that bank 

has bank secrecy laws that will make it impossible to 

ascertain the location of the money once it is there?

 Does that fall within the statute?

 MR. BEARD: At this point, no, Justice, 

because you haven't suggested that there was any type of 

design, any intent to disguise or conceal. You've just 

suggested it went to another place. If I sent it to an 

account --

JUSTICE ALITO: If that's the purpose. If 

the person says, I'm sending this to blank country 

because they've got bank secrecy laws there that make it 

impossible to find this money once it gets into their 

banking system.

 MR. BEARD: No.

think so. Now, if I were sending money to accounts in

have you, then I -- then I think a different result. 

But if I'm just sending from my account here to my 

account there, then no.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you say the same 

thing for -- if you just put it in a safe deposit box in 

a bank in the Bahamas?

 MR. BEARD: I would make the same -- my 

answer would be the same without more, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the "more" is 

they don't hold it under your name. They hold it under 

a numerical account number. Then that changes 

everything?

 MR. BEARD: It very well may. At least -- I 

don't know that it changes everything, but it very well 

may lead to a different result. But you just modified 

the hypothetical.

 What I'm -- what I'm suggesting is that if 

you're just putting money in a safety deposit box or 

this account or under the mattress or in the hole in the 

back yard --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Because the police can't 

find it in that account even if it is still under your 

name. In an account here the police would be able to 

find it. In an account in the Cayman Islands, they

 MR. BEARD: Justice, no, I don't think so, 

and I'll briefly answer and try to come back to you in 

rebuttal.

 But I think that it's important to 

understand the money laundering statute is not a 

detection statute. That's not where the focus of the 

statute rests.

balance of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA H. SCHERTLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. SCHERTLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The international concealment money 

laundering statute contains no appearance of legitimate 

wealth requirement, nor does it demand proof that the 

illegal proceeds will be cleansed after they cross the

United States border. Petitioner's construction of the 

statute is not supported by its tests and would defeat 

its purpose.

 What the statute does require is proof 

beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knows that 

he has illegal proceeds and that he knows that the 

transportation across the border of those known illegal 

proceeds is designed in whole or in part to conceal or 

disguise one, at least one, of the facts in the statute 

about those proceeds. The phrase "designed in whole or 

in part" directs a full examination of the plan, of the 

way in which the cross-border transportation of these 

known illegal proceeds was planned out.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Does the word 

"transportation" mean the act of transportation across 

the border or the method of transportation?

 MS. SCHERTLER: The word "transportation" 

itself means the carrying of something from one place to 

another. The phrase "designed in whole or in part," 

suggests that one should look at the entire plan, the 

way that this transportation was conceived or planned 

out in the mind, which would include, we would submit, 

the method that was -- that was chosen to be used for 

this transportation, the individual who was designated 

to conduct this transportation of known illegal proceeds

across the United States border, and, yes, reasons for 

conducting that transportation as well.

 But it is not limited, as Petitioner would 

suggest, to just one fact, that being what's going to 

happen to the funds after the transportation is over.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You go back to 

Justice Alito's question. I agree with you that you 

could read this as including a prohibition against a 

method of transportation which method is to hide the 

money. You could. But you could also read it the way 

that the question suggests, to refer only to the 

transportation. So you transport it physically in order 

later to hide it.

 Now, the difference between the two is if we 

accept yours, which is the broader, this statute 

includes everything that has nothing to do with the 

common word "money laundering." Any time you hide 

something, for whatever reason you hide it, to take it 

to pay the couriers, you're money laundering. Any time 

you run a gambling operation and the people stick the 

money in the wad of their shoe, they're money 

laundering.

 I mean, why would you think Congress would 

want that narrow reading when it can be read to focus 

much more closely on money laundering just by reading it

literally for what it says?

 MS. SCHERTLER: Your Honor, several 

responses to that, to that question.

 First of all, what's the purpose -- if we 

want to look beyond the words "designed in whole or in 

part" in the context of the international money 

laundering statute to try to discern what the purpose 

was of the statute, the purpose of this statute was to 

prevent criminals from taking their proceeds abroad 

where they would be outside the reach of all of these 

controls that have been set up in the United States in 

order to detect illegal proceeds and use those proceeds 

to trace back to the crimes and the criminals that 

generated them.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if that's all they were 

getting at, they wouldn't have to have this 

international component at all, because if you totally 

eliminated the "to or through" requirement and you were 

able to focus or properly focus solely on the method of 

the transportation, et cetera, then you would cover not 

only cases in which the concealment ultimately would 

take place by crossing a border, but you would pick up 

cases in which the concealment would take place even 

within the United States; and that would certainly be in 

the government's interest.

But if you add, if you say, well, but this 

is limited by a to or through requirement, then it 

suggests, it seems to me, as Justice Breyer's question 

does, that it must -- the statute must be getting at 

what happens when it crosses the border as opposed to 

the means of crossing.

 What's your answer to that?

 MS. SCHERTLER: My answer to that, Your 

Honor, is that that would have -- that would defeat the 

purpose for which this statute was enacted. The -- the 

premise of this statute was that once illegal proceeds 

are taken abroad, taken outside of the United States 

system, we lose control of them, we lose the ability to 

find them, and we will have no idea --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that would be -- that 

would be equally true and an equally appropriate 

objective without the "to or through" requirement in 

there. In other words, you don't have to have the "to 

or through" requirement in order to give the government 

a tool for exactly the purpose that you describe.

 MS. SCHERTLER: And there -- there could 

have been drafted a statute that was even broader than 

this one in that respect. But the way -- the reason 

that Congress imposed the "to or through" requirement is 

that it knew -- is that that was when law enforcement in

the United States would lose the ability to use ordinary 

investigative methods to find the proceeds of illegal 

fraud.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then what you're saying, I 

suppose, is that the movement of funds, if they're 

illegal proceeds, outside of the country is a per se 

concealment?

 MS. SCHERTLER: No, Your Honor. We do not 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Give me an example of when 

you take money outside of the country that's illegal 

money --

MS. SCHERTLER: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's not a 

concealment?

 MS. SCHERTLER: Yes. Let's say you have a 

drug dealer who conducts a number of drug transactions 

on one side of the border, takes his daily take, puts it 

in his pocket or his wallet and crosses the border into 

Mexico. Based on that evidence alone, the government 

would not be able to show beyond a reasonable doubt that 

merely taking those illegal proceeds, known illegal 

proceeds, putting them in your pocket, that that was 

designed to conceal the location, that there was a 

plan --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well then, let me back up. 

Then let me add this. It seems to me that you're 

saying, as you have to say, that any movement of illegal 

funds outside the country which is concealed is per se 

concealing a relevant attribute?

transportation of illegal proceeds is covered. And they 

did not. What they did was they set up this filter 

for the ones --

concealing the control. You're always concealing the 

ownership. You're always concealing the location if 

it's in your shoe or in the bottom of the car.

he's going to do it. So -- and you're saying, I take 

it, 100 percent of the time that's illegal. If you're 

not saying that, I don't understand what you're saying.

 MS. SCHERTLER: No --

JUSTICE BREYER: If you are saying that, I 

don't know why they call this statute "Laundering of 

Monetary Instruments." Why didn't they call it "shoe 

hiding"?

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're basically 

confronting face-on the dissent here, which drew a 

distinction between transporting to conceal and 

concealing to transport. And all you have here is 

concealing to transport, and the question is whether 

that violates the statute.

 I agree with Justice Breyer that if this is 

a statute directed at concealing to transport, it's a 

funny name for it to think that it's a money laundering 

statute.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Your Honor, the title of 

this statute, "Money Laundering," this is exactly 

what -- among the conduct that Congress had in mind when

it enacted and when it confronted money laundering in 

1986. It saw money laundering as the variety of ways in 

which criminals prevent the detection of their illegal 

proceeds and thus are able to profit from their crimes. 

It covered a wide range of conduct that included 

converting, yes, illegitimate wealth into legitimate 

forms through very complex means.

 But Congress was also concerned about 

criminals taking their proceeds across the border 

surreptitiously --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Were they concerned that 

this was a 20-year penalty, not what you're talking 

about, the person who gets -- who is the drug dealer, 

but all that this evidence shows is that we have a 

courier. We don't even know if he knows who put the 

money in the car. We don't know if he knows the -- who 

the person is that he's to deliver the money to.

 So on your theory, all you have to prove is 

that this defendant drove a car in which illicit money 

was hidden in order to get it out of the country. No 

grand design. All he is is a courier.

 MS. SCHERTLER: He needs to know that part 

of the design, part of the plan of that transportation, 

was to conceal or disguise --

of fancy language. All he knows, in fact, if he's just 

a courier is that somebody gave him money to take this 

car in which drug money is hidden across the border.

 MS. SCHERTLER: And the use of that courier 

also was part of a design to conceal or disguise the 

ownership and control --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not his design. His 

design is only -- I mean, he's just a drug courier, and 

I think that's what -- that's a problem with your 

interpretation of the statute. One can think of the 

kingpin having this elaborate plan, and when it gets to 

Mexico it's going to go into this bank and that place. 

But here the defendant is simply a courier, and on the 

government's theory anyone who transports hidden money 

to get it out of the country, who drives the car, just 

the driver, is a money launderer.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Justice Ginsburg, the --

Congress's purpose here was in getting at exactly this 

kind of conduct by third parties in particular, because 

when you use a third party that violates another purpose 

at which the statute is directed: using third parties 

to conceal who the true owner in control of the proceeds 

is.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I suppose then the brother 

should be -- giving the money to the brother should

satisfy the statute.

 MS. SCHERTLER: It --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Because if I'm -- if I'm in 

the drug business and my -- my brother is an 

international social worker or something, I'm certainly 

going to conceal when I give it to him and he carries it 

across the border.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Yes, Justice Souter, that 

would be another example of using a third party so that 

a -- so that one part of the design of that 

transportation is to conceal the ownership and control 

of the proceeds.

 And in response to Justice Ginsburg's 

question, Congress also -- well, in the sentencing 

guidelines system now, the guidelines takes account of 

whether you have the individual who is also engaged in 

the underlying offense or whether you have a third party 

who had not been involved in the underlying offense.

 But no -- no matter how you see it, this was 

precisely the conduct that Congress is getting at. It 

saw that the only way to -- to get at crime -- one way 

that was very important to it was to get at the money 

and in order to get at the money you need to be able to 

counteract the ways in which the criminals would prevent 

law enforcement from getting at the money.

JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the person who set 

all this up lives in Mexico and the sole intent of that 

person was to bring the money back to him in the place 

where he lives? That would -- would that be money 

laundering by him, to start out with?

 MS. SCHERTLER: If he had designed this 

transportation, yes, Your Honor, because the whole --

the design of this transportation was to conceal or 

disguise all five of the attributes of these illegal 

proceeds.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that a question of --

isn't that a question of his intent?

so that he can spend it. What -- what's concealing 

there?

 MS. SCHERTLER: And he's arranged it in a 

way, if we're assuming the transportation here, so that 

his ownership and control of those proceeds will be 

disguised --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It won't be disguised.

 MS. SCHERTLER: -- during the course of the 

transportation by saying, I'm going to select a third 

party.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: During the course of 

the transportation. That is not what you say in your 

brief. I'm looking at page 41 and what you say is: "If 

no independent evidence establishes that concealment or 

disguising of the pertinent attribute of the proceeds 

would occur at the point of destination, then a 

factfinder would lack a reasonable basis for inferring 

that the transportation was designed to conceal or 

disguise."

 In other words, in the hypothetical 

Justice Scalia just gave -- in other words everybody 

knows he's a drug dealer, he spends the money -- there 

is no concealment or disguising the pertinent attribute 

at the point of destination.

 MS. SCHERTLER: That -- the sentence,

Mr. Chief Justice, that you just read is the last in a 

series of "if's" that we lay out in our brief, where we 

-- where we assert that at any point in the 

transportation a jury could find evidence of a design to 

conceal or disguise. And that last sentence says if 

they haven't found any evidence concerning the means and 

the method and the person used for the act of 

cross-border transportation, and if in addition there 

was no evidence of what would occur at the point of 

destination, then there would be no evidence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there is no money 

laundering if they conceal the proceeds in a suitcase 

that's in the trunk of the car? Is that enough?

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, that would --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that concealing 

the money?

 MS. SCHERTLER: If we're talking about just 

the attribute of location, use of a suitcase I would say 

provides some evidence that there was a design to 

conceal the location of those illegal proceeds during --

as part of this cross-border transportation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does use of a 

suitcase provide that evidence?

 MS. SCHERTLER: I think it would provide 

basis for a jury to make --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When I use a 

suitcase I'm using it to carry my clothes, not to 

conceal them.

 MS. SCHERTLER: And if the jury were 

presented with testimony that that was the design --

that the only design, the only purpose, the only plan in 

using that suitcase was to use it to secure money for 

travel, then we would not have met our burden, but based 

solely on the circumstances.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, your answer to 

Justice Scalia's hypothetical is still not clear to me. 

It -- it seems to me your answer should be yes, because 

he's concealing the ownership as of the time he goes 

across the border, which brings me to my earlier 

question, if once it's concealed, the statute is always 

-- is always valid.

 Then you indicated that oh, well, what 

happens at the destination is very important. Then we 

had Justice Scalia's hypothetical. I'm not sure where 

you came out on that.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Oh, our -- let me -- let me 

be clear. I think even if one were to hypothesize that 

there would be no effort whatsoever to conceal the money 

at the point of destination, but a jury could find that 

the transportation itself was designed in other

respects -- in its method, in its means -- to conceal or 

disguise an attribute of the proceeds, that would be 

enough to find that it was designed in whole or in part, 

in any part --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So Concealment, 

concealment during the transportation is always a 

concealment of an attribute under the statute. That has 

to be your position.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Concealment -- yes. The 

only exception that we make would be in the Chief 

Justice's example, if the jury were to find that there 

was no design to conceal the location, for instance, to 

prevent its discovery; it was only -- my only design was 

to secure this for transport, like I put my money in my 

wallet to do that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you a broader 

question, forgetting the text of the statute for just a 

minute, because the text is extremely broad. Do you 

think the question whether there's an attempt to create 

an appearance of legitimate wealth has anything to do 

with the analysis? The question presented is whether 

there must be such a --

MS. SCHERTLER: The question presented --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And you're arguing that's 

totally irrelevant and that -- and also that that

familiar title, "Money Laundering," totally irrelevant?

 MS. SCHERTLER: Your Honor, we disagree that 

there is any -- there is no appearance of legitimate 

wealth requirement in the statute. This --

JUSTICE STEVENS: There is no -- okay.

 MS. SCHERTLER: This statute --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And the term "laundering" 

really should be totally ignored?

 MS. SCHERTLER: The term "laundering" under 

-- when it is understood to mean the way Congress meant 

it and the way Congress was viewing this conduct is much 

broader than Petitioner suggests.

 Laundering is the many ways in which 

criminals prevent detection of their proceeds. It would 

include and Congress certainly had evidence before it --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand you could 

find a violation of it, but what I'm really asking you: 

Is this just a total wild goose chase? We shouldn't 

even consider laundering at all? As I understand your 

argument, it's totally irrelevant.

 MS. SCHERTLER: The title of the statute 

says -- but the terms of the statute are what matter 

here.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So it is irrelevant?

 MS. SCHERTLER: The terms are plain. But

even if you were to look at the term "laundering," it 

would not support Petitioner's argument that that has a 

narrow meaning that includes only conduct that creates 

an appearance of legitimate wealth.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if this fellow 

were driving to Canada would that be a different case, 

because Canada does not have the sort of cash economy 

we've heard about in Mexico?

 MS. SCHERTLER: If the method of 

transportation were exactly the same, it would make no 

difference, Your Honor. In this case, this -- this 

transportation method was designed, a jury could find 

beyond a reasonable doubt, to conceal or disguise the 

ownership and control of the proceeds through the third 

party, and if that were the case and they were going to 

Mexico it would be the same. The nature and the 

location of the proceeds through the use of this secret 

compartment and the goat hair to discuss the scent of 

the proceeds from the drug detection dog.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what if the 

fellow says: You know, there are dangerous roads 

between here and Mexico. I'm hiding the money so that 

if, you know, a gang comes up they don't find it. And 

you say: No, we think you're hiding it because it's 

illegal proceeds? Is that enough to get to the jury?

MS. SCHERTLER: I think that's enough to get 

to the jury, and that would be a jury question, Your 

Honor, yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just to be clear, you 

affirmatively say that concealing to transport is 

enough, right?

 MS. SCHERTLER: Yes, Your Honor. It's --

that is enough. Concealing to transport when the jury 

-- when it is part of the design of the transportation 

to conceal the location, nature, source, ownership, or 

control, any single one of those things. And all of 

those are in here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why do you make 

distinctions between methods of concealment? And if the 

design is to get the money out of the country, why 

should it matter whether you put it in a travel bag, you 

put it in the glove compartment, you put it in your 

wallet, or you go through this elaborate disguise that 

we see here?

 What -- if what's important is getting it 

beyond the border beyond the reach of law enforcement in 

the United States, why should it make a difference how 

carefully it is concealed?

 MS. SCHERTLER: That need not make a 

difference if there is evidence before the jury, if

there is evidence that the ultimate design of the 

transportation is to conceal or disguise the proceeds at 

the point of destination.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then your only 

defense is to go across the border and before you go 

across you put all the money in your arms so the people 

can see it? That's the way you do it?

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than that?

 MS. SCHERTLER: In that situation, there 

would no basis to find concealment or disguise of 

location. Now, some of the other attributes may be at 

issue if a third party is conducting that 

transportation, but location from the method alone. So 

the jury would need information about, well, what is the 

design, what is the purpose of this cross-border 

transportation? They could still find that the 

necessary design to conceal or disguise is satisfied by 

evidence that the whole purpose here is to get it to 

Mexico where it will be turned into legitimate wealth, 

for instance.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's transporting to 

conceal.

statute covers both?

 MS. SCHERTLER: It covers both, Your Honor. 

It asks broadly what was this -- how was this 

transportation designed and planned out in whole or in 

part? In any part, was it designed to conceal or 

disguise? And that would encompass all of the stages 

that we are -- that we are discussing.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In your brief, you said 

the bulk cash statute would not apply to a courier. Do 

you still take that position, that the government's 

choice is to indict for money laundering or nothing?

 MS. SCHERTLER: The bulk cash -- well, 

the bulk -- in this case, there's no evidence in this 

record that a bulk cash smuggling statute charge would 

have been viable because there's no evidence in this 

record that this defendant knew of a currency reporting 

requirement and intended to evade it.

 Petitioner's argument that the bulk cash 

smuggling statute shows that the conduct here was not 

intended to be covered by the money laundering statute 

is incorrect for the very reason that Justice Kennedy 

has identified. The bulk cash smuggling statute could 

not have filled a gap in the money laundering statute 

for the conduct here because it has always contained a 

provision that covers the transportation of known

illegal proceeds across the border to evade a --

reporting requirements.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: There's no principle that 

all criminal statutes have to cover every -- every bad 

act. Maybe Congress has left a gap. I'm willing to 

entertain the possibility that this individual, 

obviously doing something very bad, doesn't -- falls 

between the two stools. He is neither guilty under the 

taking currency out of the country statute because he 

didn't know of the existence of the statute, and he's 

not guilty under one because he was not transporting to 

conceal but was concealing to transport. And so there's 

a gap. The Justice Department can certainly get that 

gap filled readily enough. I don't know why we should 

torture either one of the statutes to close it.

 MS. SCHERTLER: The plain reading of the 

money laundering statute covers this conduct, and 

Congress specifically had this conduct in mind. As 

Senator Biden said in questioning -- and he became one 

of the co-sponsors -- questioning a witness about this: 

Isn't it the truth that if we -- if we strengthen all 

our domestic controls against money laundering, aren't 

the criminals going to resort to physically transporting 

their cash out of the United States? This is a --

 This is part of the core conduct at which 

this statute was directed, this international 

concealment money laundering statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER: How does that show what you 

want it to show? I mean, what I just heard you say is 

that Senator Biden said if we make it very tough to 

launder money in the United States, then criminals will 

send their money abroad to be laundered.

 MS. SCHERTLER: And --

JUSTICE BREYER: They'll transport it abroad 

in order to launder it. How does that help you?

 MS. SCHERTLER: They will resort to taking 

their money physically out of the United States. And 

the Senate report says that this provision was designed 

to halt this flow.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In order to launder it. 

Were they not talking about money laundering?

 MS. SCHERTLER: If the premise --

JUSTICE BREYER: Or were they not talking 

about it? I'm just going back -- I didn't read Senator

country. It would have made no sense for Congress, 

having understood that when money leaves the United 

States we have little if any ability to know what 

happens to it, to require in the statute proof beyond a 

reasonable doubt of what would happen to the money once 

it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If you're trying to prevent 

the money --

in some cases to show that it was designed to create the

yes, Your Honor. But to take Petitioner's position that 

it would be necessary evidence in every case in which to 

prevail under this statute to know of future plans to 

launder abroad, when the premise of this statute is that 

when the money leaves the country we cannot know what 

happens to it, makes no sense.

country, why do they have the concealment requirement? 

They could have just said, you know, if you take dirty 

money out of the country you're guilty.

 MS. SCHERTLER: They --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't say that. They 

have a concealment -- I can't understand why, if the 

money is hidden during the transportation, it's any 

worse than when the money is not hidden during the 

transportation. It isn't -- it isn't the hiding during 

the transportation they're concerned about. The statute 

doesn't make any sense that way.

 MS. SCHERTLER: I think that it does, Your 

Honor.

 The Court -- the Congress certainly could 

have written it in the broad way that you've suggested. 

It's not unlike the way that they wrote section 1957, 

which covers broadly all transactions in illegal money.

 They chose to not cover everything and to 

cover cross-border transportation's where there's 

evidence of some intent on the part of that individual 

to conceal or disguise. And when you think about it, 

they had set up regulatory provisions like the 

transaction reporting requirement when there's no 

conceal or disguise. There were other controls in place 

as, say, the first line of defense against money

laundering to say, $10,000 or more is leaving the 

country, we're going to know about it because we have 

reporting requirements.

 Here the Senate report says that they made 

the decision to require evidence of concealment. 

"Evidence of concealment of a crime" is what the report 

says. And any time one of these attributes of illegal 

proceeds is being concealed or disguised, that is 

concealing a crime in a way that impairs law enforcement 

from finding those proceeds.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask -- may I ask 

this question? If the statute did include -- and I know 

you think it does not -- a requirement of trying to 

create an appearance of legitimate wealth, you would 

lose? In this case.

 MS. SCHERTLER: I don't think so, Your 

Honor, and I would -- I would go back to the evidence 

that Justice Alito has pointed out that is in this 

record, that there's evidence in this record that --

that the -- by taking the funds to Mexico, they would be 

able to be used in a way that would not raise suspicion.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, there's also, 

consistent with the evidence, they want to pay the drug 

dealer for the drugs. And then a jury -- you can't say 

it's clear beyond a reasonable doubt that that was not

your answer?

 MS. SCHERTLER: Your Honor, there was --

there was evidence in this case that the proceeds were 

removed -- this is expert testimony -- removed from the 

United States to conceal so as not to go through 

reporting requirements, so that the money would not be 

identified to U.S. law enforcement. We believe the jury 

could also infer that further efforts to conceal and 

disguise those proceeds would occur at the point of 

destination.

 MR. BEARD: Happily I've been thinking about 

it. Disruption versus detection I had told you, told 

the Court that this was not a detection statute as much 

as it is a disruption statute.

 I think it is important for the Court to 

recall that the very broad interpretations that the 

government advances today are essentially the very broad 

interpretations that the Congress rejected explicitly 20 

years ago. The Congress rejected the notion that the 

transportation of illicit funds in and of itself created 

money laundering liability. And we've discussed that.

 I think it's important, Justice Scalia, in 

particular, in response to your question to bring this 

up, because the Congress recognized that detection would 

be harder in rejecting that type of legislation, but 

rejected that they did.

 The Congress has also shown itself capable 

of -- of -- in the 1957 context of taking transactions 

involving unlawful proceeds and making those per se 

illegal. They could have easily done the same thing in 

the transportation context if they had wanted to, but 

instead they were looking at the separate behavior that 

comprises money laundering. I mean, it is the notion 

that you're taking money somewhere else and you're doing

something else and it gives rise to separate liability.

 I think the true harm in the government's 

interpretation, it basically conflates liability for 

money laundering with the underlying offense, because 

all of the underlying offenses involve concealment.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask the same basic 

question of you? Do you think that this line, "create 

an appearance of legitimate wealth" is an essential 

element of the offense?

 MR. BEARD: It is not an element, 

Justice Stevens. As I said, so --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So then your question 

presented raised that question, you're walking away from 

that question?

 MR. BEARD: We have spoken in the question 

presented in that broad term, because we think that that 

language encapsulates what's taking place.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It is not an essential 

element of the offense?

 MR. BEARD: It's not an element. But what 

is an essential element is the need for the 

transportation -- the transportation to be designed to 

accomplish the same thing, to obfuscate those 

attributes. It's -- and that's -- and therein is the 

reason why --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- the same thing, 

appearance of legitimate wealth goes to one of the 

attributes, the nature of what's being transported. It 

doesn't go to all the other attributes.

 MR. BEARD: The Congress had identified, 

Justice Alito, those particular attributes as being key 

to allowing the launderer to inject the money back into 

commerce. It may be that nature is implicated more 

often, but the Congress chose to list the others because 

they felt that those were the particular attributes 

that, broadly speaking, allowed for the laundering 

process.

 This notion of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the evidence is 

clear that he knew he was taking it across the border 

and it was to pay the drug dealer? Would that suffice?

 MR. BEARD: For liability under the statute, 

Justice? No, because the purpose there was not to 

obscure the attributes. It is simply repayment. It's 

the final leg, if you will --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- no, no. He 

conceals it, in order to pay the drug dealer.

 MR. BEARD: Yes. I'm saying that -- I may 

have misunderstood. If you are saying Mr. Cuellar were 

to know he was paying the drug dealer?

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 MR. BEARD: That wouldn't give rise to 

laundering, because all you have there basically is 

money spending. It's the conduct of the underlying --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's concealing who owns 

and controls.

 MR. BEARD: No, I don't think so. I think 

what you would have under these circumstances is merely 

the final step, if you will, in the underlying unlawful 

activity.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Beard, can't you give 

us something we can get this guy on?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. BEARD: I'm not comfortable doing that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He's carrying dirty money. 

It even smells of drugs.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can't we get him as an 

accessory to drug dealing or something? You say he has 

to walk?

 MR. BEARD: Well, Justice, I'm not 

uncomfortable with the notion of him walking, because 

I'm not uncomfortable with the notion you brought up 

earlier with that there may indeed be a gap. If there 

is a gap, then there's a remedy for that. But I think

that if --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The point -- the point 

about aiding and abetting something, this money reeks of 

marijuana, and that was very puzzling to me. Why this 

is the standard operating procedure to take this money 

and wrap it in containers that had contained the drug. 

So when the police find it, they know it's drug money.

 MR. BEARD: Justice, I know that the --

initially the way this went down was the money that was 

in his pocket. That's what triggered the -- that's what 

they said smelled like raw marijuana. And then 

eventually, they found the drug money. And I can't tell 

you why they did it this way. But I think that your 

question underscores they were concerned not with 

obfuscating any attributes, obviously, they were 

concerned with getting this money back to repay the 

person who had sent the drugs north under the 

government's theory.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Beard. The case is submitted.
