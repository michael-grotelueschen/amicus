CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

this morning in case 06-457, Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor 

Transport Association.

 Mr. Stern.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL STERN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. STERN: Chief Justice, and may it please 

the Court:

 Congress has left to the States and 

encouraged them to deal with the significant public 

health problem of youth access to tobacco. The question 

presented is whether the FAAA Act nonetheless preempts 

the two State laws before the Court and those laws that 

ensure that tobacco shipped into the State of Maine does 

not end up in the hands of our children.

 It is not contested that Maine can and, in 

fact, has banned the retail sale of tobacco unless the 

seller verifies the age of the buyer. Section 

1555-C(3)(C) regulates the seller and not a carrier. It 

requires that a -- in the context of a delivery sale, a 

seller cannot engage in that sale in the State of Maine 

unless the seller ensures that the person delivering the 

tobacco actually verifies the age of the buyer. This

law does not relate to the services of the carrier, but 

rather relates to a dangerous substance that Congress 

has asked the States and left to the States and 

encouraged the States to deal with.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, certainly that 

may be true, but it certainly relates to the service of 

a carrier.  I understood your argument to be that we 

can't read that language literally.

 MR. STERN: Exactly --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It talks about what 

carriers have to do, so -- in connection with delivery, 

so it relates to the service of the motor carrier.

 MR. STERN: Well, Your Honor, section 1555-C 

(3)(C) does not dictate at all what a carrier has to do. 

It is an incentive that permits a carrier, if the 

carrier wishes to compete on a level playing field for 

the legal tobacco delivery market --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't dictate 

what they have to do. They can get out of the business.

 MR. STERN: They can get out of the business 

or compete for the business, Your Honor. But the point 

is that the law regulates the retailer and not the 

carrier and, in doing so, similar to the situation in 

Travelers, allows for a market to be created.

 In particular, however, with respect to this

particular situation, Congress has spoken directly to it 

and this Court has considered in the context of its 

ERISA cases how Congress has dealt specifically with the 

problem before the Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we also 

considered it in Morales, and I thought this law was 

enacted in the immediate wake of Morales, which adopted 

a much broader reading of "relates to" than the 

subsequent ERISA cases.

 MR. STERN: We don't agree that it adopted 

such a broad view because in Morales the Court was very 

careful in the opinion to make clear that it was not 

drawing a line which would bring potentially such laws 

dealing with gambling or prostitution within the 

preemptive ambit of the ADA. Similarly, in -- with 

respect to the FAA Act, particularly looking at the 

legislative history, there is no indication that 

Congress intended in any way to deal with the State's 

controlling and regulating dangerous substances such as 

tobacco.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't that answering 

the wrong question? I'll be candid with you. I'm not 

sure that whatever Morales-Travelers distinction there 

is really counts here, because the issue here is 

different from the issue in some of the -- in most of

the preemption cases, because the issue here starts with 

the, I think, the agreed assumption that Congress wanted 

to end a certain category of regulation.

 And the question is would Congress have 

wanted, in effect, to permit a degree of State 

regulation when it was for a particular purpose?

 And the question then is not whether 

Congress intended or had as an object when it passed 

this statute an interference with the State's regulation 

of juvenile contraband. The question is whether it 

intended to permit any regulation with respect to 

delivery services to survive; and isn't that the tough 

question that you've got to face?

 MR. STERN: Your Honor, looking at the 

objectives of Congress as explained by Congress in the 

legislative record, it's very clear that Congress was 

concerned, the committee was concerned with, the 

proponents such as the Federal Department of 

Transportation, were concerned with the effects of the 

particular category of regulation, State economic 

regulation. The committee mentioned that nine times. 

The United States --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's because most 

regulation, you know, has an economic purpose involved. 

But the ultimate object, it seems to me, was to end the

economic effects of State patchwork transportation 

regulation.

 And therefore I think the question you've 

got to address is why would they have allowed a certain 

category of regulation that clearly affects the way 

these companies perform their services to survive solely 

on the ground that the regulation was entailed at the 

State level by the State's choice to go against youthful 

tobacco use?

 MR. STERN: Well, Your Honor, we suggest 

that the Court looks at the FAA Act and its legislative 

history, as well as what immediately preceded it, which 

was the Synar Amendment. The Synar Amendment encouraged 

the States to deal with this problem. The Federal 

Government --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But the Synar -- I don't 

have it in front of me, but the Synar Amendment refers 

to -- to a number of objects of State legislation that 

would be required, but it doesn't say anything about 

regulating transportation.

 MR. STERN: It states quite clearly that the 

intent is to encourage the States to prohibit -- or to 

enforce/enact laws that prohibit retailers and 

distributors from getting tobacco to children.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And we don't

normally think of a delivery service as a distributor of 

goods. I mean, we -- in the sense, I think, that the 

statute meant.

 I -- I read the Synar Amendment reference to 

distributors as being wholesalers, people within the 

industry who get the cigarettes from, you know, the 

manufacturing point to the corner store, as opposed 

simply to a delivery service that delivers all kinds of 

goods.

 MR. STERN: Well, a sale consists of several 

components, Your Honor: Order, payment, and delivery. 

Handing it over, handing the tobacco over physically to 

the buyer, from the standpoint of the buyer's standpoint 

and from the standpoint of public health perspective, is 

the most important aspect of the transaction.

 It is the seller who has the responsibility 

to comply with the law with respect to each one of those 

steps.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stern, at the time 

that the motor carrier deregulation came into effect, 

were there any products where Maine told the retailer, 

if you want to sell not face-to-face, you must choose a 

carrier that will provide X, Y, and Z services? Was 

there any -- is tobacco alone or were there other 

commodities?

MR. STERN: Interestingly, there -- Maine 

being a hunting State, there was a law on the books 

which required the common carrier -- it specifically 

referred to the common carrier -- to verify that the 

person shipping it was the hunter with the appropriate 

license, required the common carrier to affix 

identification tags to the hunting -- the hunting 

reward, so to speak, and also to make a return or 

provide notice to the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries 

and Wildlife.

 So Maine had a variety of those sorts of 

laws on the books that required carriers to actually do 

something with respect to a particular type of 

commodity.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the Postal Service 

adhere to -- or I don't know if the Postal Service is 

used to ship cigarettes, tobacco products. But if it 

is, does the Postal Service adhere to Maine's 

requirement?

 MR. STERN: Two points, Your Honor. First, 

the Postal Service has immunity from Maine laws. And 

second, the Postal Service, interestingly, does have an 

addressee verification service for $4.10.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does the Post Office 

have immunity from Maine laws? Really?

MR. STERN: I believe there --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You could kill people and 

all sorts of stuff. I mean --

(Laughter.)

 MR. STERN: I hope not, Your Honor. But 

with respect to a variety of civil regulatory matters, I 

believe the courts have concluded that the United States 

Postal Service has immunity from Maine -- from Maine and 

other State laws.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it does -- you say 

the Postal Service provides something that conforms, 

that they have the -- you must deliver it to the person, 

to the addressee herself?

 MR. STERN: Yes, Your Honor. It is not 

exactly conforming because -- it's sort of interesting. 

Different carrier services or the Postal Service have 

different sort of options that seem to make clear that 

this is not a real problem to provide. The U.S. Postal 

Service provides an addressee verification service, but 

not an age verification service. UPS provides an age 

verification service, but not an addressee verification 

service.

 Since one costs $2.75 and the other one 

costs $4.10, this does not seem to be an acute problem 

to -- for a carrier, if it wishes to compete for the

market, to actually compete for it and price it 

appropriately.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But why aren't you just 

driving all this business to the Postal Service? I 

mean, you know, what have you accomplished? You'd drive 

FedEx out of business if they choose not to incur the 

additional expense. And so, you know, all these people 

just ship it through the Postal Service.

 MR. STERN: There have been efforts to deal 

with the Postal Service loophole, Your Honor, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't do it. I mean, 

they're exempt from Maine laws. Didn't you know that?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. STERN: I think I heard somebody mention 

that, Your Honor.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. STERN: Certainly, in another branch of 

government, that -- there's an effort to deal with that 

problem. But, with respect to the suggestion we've 

driven FedEx out of business, there's no suggestion --

well, first of all, we have no evidence with respect to 

what this effect has had on FedEx. With respect to UPS, 

UPS continues to ship tobacco to licensees and has not 

shown in the record that they lost any business with any 

of their customers, obtained licenses from the State of

Maine, and therefore it could actually ship into the 

State of Maine.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But what if every -- what if 

every State enacted a slightly different law relating to 

this and a slightly different law relating to every 

other product that they might want to restrict for 

health or safety reasons? Would you -- would you agree 

then with the Respondent that there would be just the 

kind of patchwork of regulation at the State level that 

this statute was intended to stop?

 MR. STERN: Well, Your Honor, the 

Respondent's arguments do not guarantee uniform 

regulation. In fact, they guarantee exactly the 

opposite. They don't dispute that Maine and other 

States can ban the transport and delivery of what we can 

call unlicensed tobacco, tobacco from unlicensed 

retailers, to unlicensed entities. Different States can 

have different licensing requirements and certainly 

different licensees. So a patchwork is created.

 In addition, Respondents agree that States 

can outright ban the furnishing of a variety of 

commodities or contraband, including in particular 

tobacco or alcohol --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that wasn't 

clear from their brief. I thought they had a footnote

that said they weren't arguing the point in this case, 

but I thought they didn't concede the total ban.

 MR. STERN: I believe if one looks at --

it's either page 24 or 44 of the brief -- they concede 

that Maine and other States can ban the furnishing of 

tobacco.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they --

JUSTICE SOUTER: They concede that they can 

do it beyond the requirement, beyond the force of the 

statute that precludes the knowing distribution. In 

other words, they -- they're not appealing the one 

provision of subsection D that makes it a crime 

knowingly to get the tobacco into the hands of minors 

and so on, but do they concede anything beyond that?

 MR. STERN: I believe they do, Your Honor. 

I believe -- I think it's at page 44 -- they concede 

that Maine can ban the furnishing of tobacco by anyone, 

including a carrier.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I think that the 

reason they make that concession is that they say you 

must prove knowledge, and they're -- they're not 

concerned about the -- about intentionally transgressing 

Maine's law. What they're concerned about is the 

additional steps that you require them to go through to 

make sure that there is no tobacco.

So they're not really worried about it so 

long as you have a knowledge requirement.

 MR. STERN: Well, there is a knowledge 

requirement in the first part of section 1555-D. And 

Your Honor's question gets right to the nub of the 

problem with respect to the lower court's decision on 

1555-D, which is: How does Maine or any other State go 

about proving knowing delivery of an unlicensed product 

such as this?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you prove it without 

a presumption to start with. That's what the -- that's 

way the issue was left by the district court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's why they're not 

worried about it, because it's hard to prove.

 MR. STERN: Without the evidentiary 

assumption, it's very difficult, if not impossible, to 

prove, which essentially makes the first part of the 

court's decision with respect to 1555 --

JUSTICE BREYER: The answer to that is it 

may be a very good idea, so convince Congress to pass a 

law. It's just that if every State does it differently 

it's going to be a nightmare. And I don't know what the 

answer to that point is.

 And I don't know what the answer to the 

point is about banning things. I'm amazed if that's

what you mean. I'm not sure what you mean. I mean, 

North Carolina could pass a statute that says the 

following: Everybody in North Carolina over the age 16, 

say, or maybe everybody including small children -- I 

don't know what they want to pass -- can smoke to their 

heart's delight, can buy as many cigarettes as they 

like, but you can't ship in a single cigarette from out 

of State.

 You think that wouldn't cause -- raise a 

Commerce Clause problem?

 MR. STERN: A Commerce Clause problem?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. STERN: It depends upon how the statute 

is written. If it banned --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's why I'm just 

not certain about bans that forbid people to ship things 

inside from outside the State, while allowing people to 

buy those things produced by people inside the State. 

That's why I'm uncertain about the concession you're 

talking about.

 MR. STERN: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, what is this New 

York law that does this?

 MR. STERN: The New York law banned the 

delivery and sale of tobacco -- delivery and sales of

cigarettes to B(2) --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't that the result 

of a settlement?

 MR. STERN: The -- the law was -- existed 

before the settlement, and the settlement which we have 

referred to is a situation where UPS and a number of 

other carriers have agreed to conform with it, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And nationwide, not just 

in New York; isn't that so?

 MR. STERN: Yes, Your Honor. And it -- it 

reveals, we think, that the -- that the nature of the 

laws here are not so burdensome as to run afoul of this 

Court's concerns --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, then, practically, 

you don't have a problem with cigarettes because the New 

York settlement takes care of it. You're just talking 

about other tobacco products?

 MR. STERN: Well, there are other tobacco 

products, but in the New York settlement -- we can't 

enforce the New York settlement, Your Honor. We have 

our own separate law, particularly section --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought, as a 

result of the New York settlement, carriers are no 

longer shipping directly to consumers anyplace

cigarettes.

 MR. STERN: That is the intent of that, Your 

Honor. I'm not sure how effective it has been. But by 

doing that, they have agreed and put in place a system 

where tobacco products can only be shipped from a 

licensee.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But the thing I'm concerned 

about is -- is assume it's perfectly legal to do what 

you said. I guess it still wouldn't be legal for Maine 

or New York to say the following: We really want to 

discourage people from smoking, a noble goal. And, 

therefore, whenever an interstate shipper ships tobacco 

into the State, he has to charge double the price, just 

double the shipment price or ten times the shipment 

price. Could they say that?

 MR. STERN: That would seem to clearly run 

afoul of the --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right.

 MR. STERN: -- Commerce Clause.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But could they 

say you have to carry it in special packages which the 

sticker -- which maybe you should do, but which the 

sticker puts skull and crossbones on each of the 

packages? Could they say that?

JUSTICE BREYER: No. All right.

 MR. STERN: -- they necessarily could, Your 

Honor.

 JUDGE BREYER: If they cannot say either of 

those things because of the statute, why can they say: 

What you have to do is you have to ship it in a way that 

makes certain that the person who receives it, the 

addressee, is the person who bought it?

 MR. STERN: The reason, Your Honor, is the 

difference between the hypothetical you proposed at the 

beginning of your question and what's going on in Maine 

with respect to 1555-C(3)(C), which is a mouthful.

 At the time the FAAA Act was enacted, it was 

illegal for anyone to -- an unlicensed retailer, to sell 

tobacco in the State of Maine, and it was illegal to 

sell tobacco without verifying the age of the buyer. 

That's the generally applicable law that was -- a 

judicial sort of law that was on the books in 1994.

 The skull and crossbones requirement is not 

a judicial type of law, and what this Court has done in 

the ERISA cases is look to see the -- the purpose and 

type of law that is before it to determine whether it 

was a type of law that was in existence and whether 

there was any positive indication that -- that that sort 

of law was supposed to be pre-empted or not.

Here these sorts of age verification laws 

were on the books. We have identified the problem and 

everybody understands the problem with respect to 

delivery and sales.

 It would be absurd for an over-the-counter 

clerk to take money from someone --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stern, can I ask you 

this question: To what extent are we dealing with a 

tobacco problem or a broader problem? Do you have other 

products that are contraband such as -- or have special 

restrictions on who can ship wild animals, prescription 

drugs, firearms; or are there other products that you 

regulate in the same way?

 MR. STERN: There are no -- I'm not aware of 

any that we -- we regulate in the same way. In similar 

JUSTICE STEVENS: You allow shippers to ship 

firearms and poisonous substances without having this 

kind of restriction on it, do you?

 MR. STERN: There are not exactly the same 

restrictions. But, with respect to alcohol, we have a 

law on the books which prohibits the knowing sale or 

transfer of alcohol to somebody who is underage.

 Because of the -- the unique situation we 

found with respect to delivery and sales of tobacco,

we've put this in place to make it clear how a seller 

goes about conforming with Maine's generally applicable 

law.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But I don't really see why 

the States have -- have a different interest in 

regulating shipment of tobacco to minors than they would 

a variety of other substances that could be harmful to 

minors or contraband in general. And you don't try to 

regulate any of those?

 MR. STERN: Well, Your Honor, we do try to 

regulate those. I misunderstood your question.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: By -- by regulating how 

they may be shipped, I mean.

 MR. STERN: There is no law exactly like 

this one with respect to the other types of -- of 

dangerous substances. There is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stern, you told me in 

-- in response to my question earlier, you mentioned 

only, I think, game; and you said that those 

prohibitions were directly on the carrier --

MR. STERN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that is, prohibitions 

and instructions for how you can ship game. And I don't 

know if that -- if there are other food products. You 

mentioned only that one.

And is it not the case that explosives --

that that's Federal regulation?

 MR. STERN: The Federal Government has a 

role with respect to the shipment of explosives, but it 

has no role with respect to the shipment of tobacco.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is there -- in 

addition to the Federal regulation, which I take it 

would cover various dangerous substances, does Maine add 

to what the Federal regulation is, say, for sending 

fireworks, firearms?

 MR. STERN: With respect to fireworks, Maine 

in its discretion has adopted the Federal role -- the 

Federal view, which, I think, emphasizes and -- and 

highlights the different situation we have here.

 When the Federal Government believed there 

should be some sort of uniform regulation of a 

particular dangerous item, be it fireworks, for example, 

or hazardous material, it does so. Otherwise, it leaves 

it to the States.

 And this is a situation where if the State 

doesn't act to deal with the problem of delivery and 

sales, we have a regulatory void and nobody deals with 

this problem.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe because 

Congress wanted the regulatory void. Maybe Congress

didn't want these things to be enforced by regulating 

the transporter, as opposed to regulating the shipper 

and the receiver.

 As far as the game regulation is concerned, 

isn't it the case that UPS won't carry any game now 

because of the -- because of your game regulations?

 MR. STERN: In their policies, they have 

indicated that they do not carry game, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's too onerous.

 MR. STERN: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you've sort of driven 

them out of the business.

 MR. STERN: No. Your Honor, UPS has a 

variety of options such as a cash-on-delivery option 

which requires them to run around and find somebody with 

a check, money order, or credit card. So they can price 

these. It's just a matter of whether they want to 

compete for them.

 And, again, with respect to C(3)(C), which 

I'd like to focus on for a moment, it would be absurd, 

we think, to have a situation where a clerk in an 

over-the-counter sale could accept money from a buyer, 

verify the age of the buyer, and then turn to a third 

person and hand the tobacco to that person without the 

buyer being present.

That is exactly the situation that 

Respondents ask this Court to embrace as the intent of 

Congress. And with respect to Your Honor's--

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, as long as the buyer 

is not an interstate carrier, there is really no -- no 

problem of conflicting with Federal law.

 MR. STERN: Well, there is no conflict with 

Federal law under our reading of the FAAA Act and the 

Synar Amendment because the -- the intent of Congress 

has to be one which does not end up in an absurd result. 

And we suggest that having this gaping conduit of 

tobacco to children is just such an absurd result.

 If the Court has no further questions now, 

I'd like to reserve my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Stern.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. BRINKMANN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 If Maine's tobacco delivery law is not 

preempted, Congress's core purpose for the FAAAA will be 

defeated. There will be different delivery laws in 

States across the country, and that patchwork will

eliminate the efficiency and the cost savings that was 

Congress's intent in the FAAAA when it enacted it to 

deregulate the industry.

 If I could, I'd like to try and quantify for 

you the enormous impact and effect that these two 

provisions have on carrier services.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you do that, 

Ms. Brinkmann, would you tell us how alcohol is handled, 

because that is, as I understand it, that's by virtue of 

the 24th Amendment State regulation. Does UPS carry 

alcohol packages from one State to another?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, alcohol is, of course, 

governed by a different legal regime because of the 21st 

Amendment. And yes, they do provide services for wine 

and beer only, and that service has to be pursuant to a 

contract. It is a special contract with the shipper, 

and the shipper has to be licensed.

 And UPS and the other carriers have uniform 

procedures for doing that, so they are not subject to a 

patchwork of regulation, unless there are laws in the 

States that are allowed because of the 21st Amendment.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I asked the question 

only in response to your impossibility argument that you 

couldn't cope with such State regulations with respect 

to tobacco, when it seems you are with respect to

alcohol.

 MS. BRINKMANN: I think it would be useful 

to give the quantification, I think, about the impact of 

these provisions. I would first point out that the 

services that are provided right now are in response to 

the market and market competition, which was Congress's 

intent. And these, of course, would be services that 

were created in response to a State dictate, which is at 

the core of the problem.

 But just to give you an idea about the 

C(3)(C), which is the delivery confirmation --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Before you leave the 

alcohol point, I don't quite understand the relevance of 

the 21st Amendment. It seems to me if you can 

pre-empt -- if Federal law can pre-empt State laws that 

are authorized by the 21st Amendment, I don't understand 

how that has anything to do with the preemption issue.

 MS. BRINKMANN: I think it involves much 

more complicated constitutional issues that reach the 

21st Amendment. I think even in light of this Court's 

opinion in Granholm v. Heald, there would be more 

complex issues to analyze --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Why isn't it still a State 

regulation of shipping, even if it's a law that's 

authorized by the 21st Amendment? I don't see the

difference.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, it may be not be, Your 

Honor. The problem has been taken care of by this 

uniform service, and I have to say that is at the age of 

21. That is an adult confirmation. And that is not an 

addressee-specific requirement.

 Here under C(3)(C), it would be a new 

service that required the actual addressee to sign for 

it. And I should comment, my understanding of U.S. 

Postal Service is it doesn't have to be the addressee 

who signs. They can designate someone else to sign for 

it, and there is no age verification. But here it has 

to be the addressee, and there has to be photo 

government ID for anyone between 18 and 27. And if I 

could just for --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What if a new carrier 

said, well, I'd like to get into the business of 

shipping tobacco products, none of the other companies 

want to do it, I want to form -- I'll form my own 

company. It will meet all these requirements. Would it 

-- would it then be pre-empted?

 MS. BRINKMANN: If the State was dictating a 

service that made --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they're saying the 

retailer must use a service that fulfills these

qualifications. And if there are services out there, 

why would the law be pre-empted?

 MS. BRINKMANN: It would depend on the 

effect on the carriers. And if I could --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that the purpose 

of the Federal law was not to enable services which 

would not otherwise be provided at all, but rather to 

enable services to be provided more economically, to 

reduce the cost, the cost of interstate transportation.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Driven by market 

competition, Your Honor. The evidence --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. Somebody would come 

in to occupy the void, but he would charge a heck of a 

lot more.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, in this case the 

evidence demonstrates -- in the court of appeals 

appendix there's the deposition by Ms. Meisel, which 

explains on pages 163 and 189 that it's not flipping a 

switch to create a new service like this. Many systems 

would have to be completely reengineered to take in new 

data about age and addressee. There would have to be a 

new system for the alert. There would have to be a new 

system for reading the alert. That takes one 

and-a-half years, 18 months, for that modification to 

occur. That's an enormous effect.

And I would also like just to look at --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's the effect on 

UPS; is that not right?

 MS. BRINKMANN: On the carrier services.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that foreclose the 

possibility that somebody else might just specialize in 

delivering tobacco products, for example?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, if there were a 

requirement or Maine law, for example, for a widely 

already established adult signature requirement, that 

may have a different preemption analysis. There 

certainly would not be the problems of uniformity. But 

I don't think it could be something that's dictated. 

And if a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't there would be 

a problem? I don't understand that. There would still 

be a problem with uniformity from State to State.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think if Maine did 

it for all products it would be okay? It's only they're 

doing it for tobacco that makes it bad?

 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't think so.

 MS. BRINKMANN: That cost that I just 

described has to be multiplied for 50 States and many

commodities.

 And also, if you look at the 1555-D, the 

prohibition on unlicensed tobacco retailers sending to a 

consume and the imputed knowledge, the law that has 

strict liability on the carrier, if there is a box that 

has a shipper's name from the attorney general's list, 

that imputed knowledge would require that every one of 

the 65,000 or 16 million packages going to Maine every 

year be examined for the shipper identification.

 And in the record, there is -- the State has 

admitted at J-96 that that kind of research to look 

into -- in this case it was looking at the sender, but 

it would be the same for the shipper -- I mean, it was 

looking for the addressee; this would be for the shipper 

-- is two dollars per package.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How did they deal with 

under the New York settlement? I take it this would be 

a problem under that settlement, because it doesn't 

touch selling from a duly licensed dealer. And so, 

under the New York settlement, which operates 

nationwide, what does the carrier do to make sure that 

the recipient is a licensed dealer?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Under the New York 

settlement there's a very complex structure that the 

carriers have agreed to, first of all forbidding all

delivery of cigarettes to consumers.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does that appear in 

the materials? Do you remember where it is?

 MS. BRINKMANN: There is a citation to it in 

the Petitioner's brief, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But there's no text, 

though?

 MS. BRINKMANN: It's available, I believe, 

on the attorney general of New York's web site. There's 

a very -- for example, in the UPS assurance of 

discontinuance, there's a three-tier disciplinary scheme 

against shippers that are found to violate that.

 And the carriers entered into these 

agreements under threat of criminal sanctions. The New 

York statute made one offense a misdemeanor and a second 

offense a felony. And the carriers, who had been trying 

to abide by those laws, were faced with subpoenas and 

the threat of prosecution. And so their solution was a 

uniform nationwide policy, no cigarettes to consumers. 

But of course --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Ms. Brinkmann, I'm 

interested in two things. Number one, I want to make 

sure you completed the quantification point that you 

made, and you pointed us to someplace in the record, 

because the Petitioner said, oh, it just costs a penny a

package or something like that.

 And then the second point, I think probably 

not related, is the question of knowledge. I take it 

you're not contesting if there's actual knowledge that 

it's a minor that there can be a prosecution. I'm not 

sure how that works if the company -- because of the 

imputed knowledge. Suppose an officer of the company or 

some shipping clerk knows it. Wouldn't the company be 

liable if the company were subject to -- those are two 

different questions.

 MS. BRINKMANN: To your first question, just 

to complete it, Your Honor, at JA-96 there's an 

admission that it's a two-dollar cost to research a 

package. There it's for the addressee, but it would be 

the same for the shipper. And if you had to do that for 

the 16 million packages going to Maine a year just 

through UPS, it would be $32 million a year.

 Turning to your knowledge point, I think 

this is a very important point that the Court was 

discussing earlier and, Justice Scalia, I think you were 

discussing about the general ban. Justice Ginsburg, you 

mentioned our footnote.

 You have to know that the details of the ban 

are to figure out whether or not it is pre-empted. In 

this case, the First Circuit at Pet. App. 29 explains

why its construction of the first sentence of 1555-D, 

which prohibits any person from knowingly transporting 

contraband tobacco, is now pre-empted. But it makes 

very clear that the State law is pre-empted, Pet. App. 

29, to the extent that Maine's tobacco delivery law 

requires or has the effect of requiring carriers to 

implement State-mandated procedures in the processing or 

delivery of packages as pre-empted by the FAAAA.

 So to the extent there is a general ban 

against knowing transportation that does not require --

that does not impose a strict liability requirement --

it's a strict liability that says it's not just knowing, 

you have to look at every shipper's name. You have to 

look at every side of that box. And then you have to 

decide who the recipient is.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Brinkmann, I'm 

fascinated by this New York settlement. You -- you say 

that -- that Maine can't do this. But you say if a 

bunch of States do it, and they twist the carriers' arms 

hard enough by threatening criminal penalties, so that 

the carriers say, okay, I give up; and then they agree 

to limit their transport, that's okay?

speaking about the New York settlement as though that's 

hunky-dory.

 MS. BRINKMANN: No, it isn't. This --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that if this 

-- if this Federal act means what it says, that that 

kind of settlement isn't the kind of thing the act did 

not want to happen.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Well, it's a voluntary 

agreement in which --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Voluntary under threat of 

criminal penalty.

 MS. BRINKMANN: -- in which the carriers 

adopted a uniform approach.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's -- that's 

nice. But what about the consumer? The act was not 

just for the convenience of the carriers. It was meant 

to -- to serve the convenience and the economic benefit 

of the consumer.

 I -- I expect a consumer might be able to 

challenge that -- that New York settlement. I'm 

surprised you accepted it as, well, you know, so long as 

the carrier coughs it up, it's okay.

want to make that abundantly clear.

 I also wanted to address the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just on the knowledge 

point, I'm still not sure. I don't want to ask you if 

you concede that knowing delivery would make you liable. 

That's what the First Circuit said. I suppose that's 

not before us, so I have to take that as a premise, as a 

given.

 MS. BRINKMANN: I think, though, if I could 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a little bit hard to 

write the opinion your way with that, with that 

concession. That's my problem. Or with that premise.

 MS. BRINKMANN: I think if you understand 

what the First Circuit was saying, this is a total ban 

on knowing delivery. It doesn't require the carrier to 

change their services. So we -- the carriers don't have 

to go out and in the hundreds of countries that they 

operate change the intake procedure for shipments to be 

able to have all the data and all the --

In reality, under the current operating services that 

are provided --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you answer my 

question? May they presume that if the package is 

labeled cigarettes, that the delivery -- the delivery 

person knows that?

 MS. BRINKMANN: I wouldn't necessarily say a 

presumption, Your Honor. It is evidence that can be 

used.

 That -- we recognize that. I think some of 

the amici suggest that we say it cannot. It can be 

used. It's not a presumption. It is not something that 

deems knowledge. I can just give you some examples of 

practicality.

 The two employees who actually see the box, 

loaders and sorters, it's going by so fast, they don't

into the truck --

Oftentimes the scan on the bar code is done from a 

distance. They don't -- what the loaders look at is the 

ZIP-code, and actually with increased automation -- and 

Mr. Butler's deposition, which was filed on -- back in 

June of 2004, he talked about even greater automation 

where they won't even be reading the ZIP-code.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the way -- I'm 

telling you I assume the way it works is that the UPS 

truck goes out to the tobacco warehouse and picks up 

4,000 boxes, all registered tobacco. He certainly knows 

it's tobacco at that point.

 MS. BRINKMANN: That's not my understanding. 

That's not the evidence in this case. There are many 

ways in which the system comes in; and I certainly think 

that could be a different question of knowing and that 

would be a question of proof.

 And it can be evidence. But I'll tell you, 

if there was a driver who for the past month had found 

three boxes of tobacco and turned them in and said, you 

know, these can't be delivered, and one day one box got 

through and he didn't see it written, or it was written 

in light marker or it had, you know, bled, because they 

used the wrong thing -- there's no uniformity of size or 

anything -- no, I think that would be a question for a

jury to decide about knowledge, and it can't be a 

presumption and it can't be deemed. It is a question of 

knowledge.

 JUSTICE BREYER: May I ask you this 

question, which is where I'm having a little trouble on 

your side. I think I would agree and you would agree 

that if the State were to say, to protect the consumers 

in our State, anyone who ships in goods must do so in 

special padded cars -- use whatever shipper you want, 

but you have to have special -- that would be illegal.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can California say, anybody 

who ships lettuces into our State has to use 

refrigerated equipment? One product, not all products, 

and a good public health reason?

 MS. BRINKMANN: Your Honor, that would be 

for Congress, and it would have --

JUSTICE BREYER: So you'd say that would 

also be preempted?

 MS. BRINKMANN: I think you have to look at 

the specific statute. And we went through and really 

looked at the statutes that the State cited, and you can 

see in our brief we set out, a third of them have 

knowledge requirements. Another group -- for example 

Maine's fireworks, when you trace it down, it looks like

a local commissioner does it, and then they adopt these 

standards for an association. And what is it? It's a 

Federal standard. So I think you really have to bore 

into that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is it that knowledge 

requirements have a different preemption analysis? 

That's what I'm finding that difficult to understand.

 MS. BRINKMANN: Because the way in which the 

First Circuit construed the first sentence is just to be 

a ban on knowing transportation delivery, and said it 

can't require -- on pages 26 and 27, it says it 

different ways -- that if a liability standard of a 

State is preempted, if, for example, it required 

modification of the delivery methods, other than 

declining the package; if in the normal course of the 

services that are already provided, if there is 

knowledge that is evidence --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then that's clear 

preemption in Justice Breyer's example. If California 

says you must ship certain products in refrigerated 

containers, that is definitely preempted under your 

analysis.

 MS. BRINKMANN: If there is no Federal 

regulatory -- yes.

preemptive. A State cannot insist on that. Could they 

insist on firearms being slipped only in labeled 

packages?

 MS. BRINKMANN: There are many Federal 

regulations about the transportation --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Could the State do it 

beyond the Federal requirement?

 MS. BRINKMANN: No, Your Honor, it would 

have to be uniform, and I think that's a great example. 

The -- the Federal scheme for hazardous materials are 

extensive, and that is what carriers are focused on, on 

uniformity, on the best way in which to provide these 

services.

 If I could, I just wanted to discuss for a 

moment why we really would urge that there is no health 

and safety exception or that this can be read to be 

limited to economics. First of all --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Before you get into that, 

do we have to hold -- assuming we agree with you -- do 

we have to hold that the knowing requirement of the 

first sentence is okay?

trouble with the knowing requirement.

 MS. BRINKMANN: We do not cross-petition on 

that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Fifty different States 

having a knowing requirement for a hundred different 

products -- I don't know that that complies with the 

Federal law.

 MS. BRINKMANN: What we are responding to is 

the cert petition from the State here. I would point 

out that -- an example that the Court itself gave is 

under their health and safety exemption, that means that 

the State could come and just put a surcharge, whether 

it would be on tobacco or junk food. There is no line 

to draw between the position they take here and that 

kind of situation. We point to the text of the statute, 

of course, and the findings about the burdens on 

interstate commerce of the interstate regulation. The 

structure -- there is a facie exemption for motor 

vehicles and even that has a Department of 

Transportation Federal backdrop against it. And in the 

Morales opinion from this Court, they pointed to the 

Airline Deregulation Act, which is very important here 

because that statute is construed just as this is. And 

in the Morales the Court pointed out that an earlier

bill had had the kind of economic regulation that the 

State here seeks and it was rejected. Then of course in 

this very case, the Congress -- conference report 

embraced the Morales standard and in fact described it 

as a broad preemptive standard they intended apply here. 

So we believe that that is the standard that should 

really apply, but in light of the effect that this has 

on the carrier services, we suggest it means any 

standard of or are related to.

 There's certainly an immediate connection 

with -- and there are express references in these 

provisions that we suggest means any preemption 

standard.

 If there's -- one other thing I would say, 

up the C(3)(C), the provision which the State suggests 

does not directly dictate services, first of all the 

Solicitor General reads the statute anew and suggests 

that there may be direct enforcement against the 

carriers, which certainly would changes our view of 

that, because there is an instruction requirement that 

the shipper give to the carrier and say, State law 

mandates this.

 Moreover, we would like to point out, for 

example, in the Wolens case, the frequent flyers program 

that was at issue there was not a mandatory aspect of

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER,

 ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:

 I think there's no question that the 

State of Maine could not require carriers to obtain a 

license to deliver tobacco products and condition that 

upon the carrier's service complying with the mandates 

of State law, that that would be a law that relates to 

the carrier's service.

 Now, Maine maintains that its law is 

saved from preemption because of two distinctions: One, 

it that is adopted with a health rather than economic 

purpose, and because it operates directly on the shipper 

rather than the carrier.

 And we don't think that either of those

arguments is consistent with the text, structure, or 

legislative history of the Act. But I would want to 

point --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're talking about 

the Federal act or the Maine act?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The Federal act. 

That's right. But it's worth noting that those 

arguments, in any event, only go to the provision in 

C(3)(C). The provision that is under dispute in section 

D does not have either of those characteristics. It 

operates directly on the carrier, and it is not adopted 

for the health concern but rather to support the State's 

licensing and tax purposes.

 But if I could go back to the reasons why 

their argument is inconsistent with the text, structure, 

and history of the Federal act, as Respondents' counsel 

noted, Congress did consider an alternative version of 

this bill, one that was limited to economic regulation, 

and the Congress rejected the Senate version and adopted 

instead the House version that much more broadly 

pre-empted State regulation related to carrier services. 

It added the provision of services and adopted the 

"related to" standard rather than regulation.

 And so it has rejected this limitation that 

Petitioners urge. Moreover, the argument that there is

a general health exception to the pre-emptive force of 

the FAAAA is inconsistent with the structure of the Act. 

There are specific exceptions in the Act related, for 

example, to motor carrier safety, but those exceptions 

correspond to other grants of authority to the Secretary 

of Transportation to adopt regulations and to pre-empt 

State regulations that would interfere with interstate 

commerce or impose too much of a burden on interstate 

commerce.

 There is no similar back top, if the court 

reads into the FAAAA a textual general exception for any 

act adopted with a health purpose by the States.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If one of the big carriers 

decides for its own business purposes to offer a service 

that complied with the Maine law, would that have the 

effect of "un-pre-empting" the Maine law?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, what Congress 

-- what Congress had in mind in the Act was that 

carriers would respond to the marketplace, not State 

regulation. And where a service is widely available in 

response to the marketplace, for a State to dictate to 

shippers that they should use one service as opposed to 

another, we think would have -- it would be a different 

analysis under Morales. The Court in Morales said that 

the test was whether there was a significant effect on

the carriers.

 And where, as here, we have the three major 

carriers all providing, for example, an 

adult-signature-required service, for the -- for a State 

to say, well, when you ship alcohol, you have to use 

that available service, that would not have much of an 

effect at all on the carriers.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Even if the law --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: In fact, the 

Federal law --

JUSTICE ALITO: Even if they all now decided 

they wanted to go into this business, that would have no 

effect because they would have done that to comply with 

the Maine law rather than as -- in response to the 

marketplace?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. We 

don't think the State can adopt a law and in a sense 

force the carriers to conform their services to the 

State law and then say, oh, but now they have it. We 

don't think that would be conducive --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me rather odd 

that major carriers can determine the scope of 

pre-emption. Suppose there are smaller carriers that 

say we don't want to do this. Take the New York 

settlement example. If the New York settlement example,

in effect, opens up a new kind of service, all other 

carriers have to follow that? That's a -- there's no 

authority in our cases for that kind of pre-emption 

analysis, is there?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I think with 

respect to this particular example about the adult 

signature required, the Court probably would need to go 

no farther than the fact that the Federal government has 

itself recognized the existence of that service and 

required it in a law that relates to the shipping of 

wine when one is prohibited by safety regulations from 

taking it on the airplane with them. So the existence 

in the marketplace of this service has already 

recognized in Federal law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I follow up on 

Justice Kennedy's question, though, and specifically, do 

you think the New York settlement, if the carriers did 

not agree to it, that they would nonetheless prevail 

because the terms of it are pre-emptive?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I have not studied 

the New York statute sufficiently to speak to that, and 

I don't think the government has a position about that. 

We do believe -- the settlement agreement, though, is 

distinct from the Maine law in some very significant 

respects.

And the most important of those is that 

under the settlement agreement, the carriers agree to 

use reasonable best efforts; whereas the Maine 

provision -- this is the second sentence of D -- deems 

the carrier to have knowledge --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, see, you are

then.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I have some 

familiarity with it.

you ought to be able to tell me whether you think it's 

pre-empted by the Federal law under your theory or not.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I -- Your 

Honor, we have not taken a position on whether the 

settlement is and, with respect -- although I have 

familiarity with the settlement, I have less familiarity 

with the underlying New York statute that it was agreed 

to, in response to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you have 

familiarity with the knowing delivery requirement here.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: In our view, where, 

as construed by the First Circuit -- and we sort of 

accept that view -- the First Circuit, on page 26 of the 

Pet. App., construed the first sentence of D as 

requiring that carriers do not act as knowing 

accomplices in the illegal sale of tobacco products. So 

construed, we don't believe that that provision is 

pre-emptive. It is akin to the general prohibition on 

furnishing tobacco to minors in 1555-B(2), and we don't 

think that that provision is pre-emptive.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You mean it's akin to the 

health exception.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Excuse me.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You say it's akin to a 

health exception.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No. I -- I say 

that it is a law of general applicability, and it does 

not require any change in the carriers' practices. What 

-- what the imputation of knowledge does, however, is 

require the carriers to change their practices so that 

they will get the knowledge when they can. For example, 

take another example. If Maine said that it would 

impute knowledge to the carriers of the tobacco contents 

if an X-ray scan would reveal the cigarette contents, it 

would in effect be requiring the carriers to install

X-ray machines and pass every package that they get 

through those X-ray machines. That's how an 

imputation of knowledge can be used to direct the 

conduct of the carrier, and that's what is so 

problematic about the second sentence of D. They impute 

knowledge based upon whether the name of the shipper 

appears on a confidential list that the attorney general 

has provided. In other words, even though, in their 

normal practices, they don't pay attention whatsoever to 

the shipper's name, they have to incorporate that into 

their practices in order to avoid the imputation of 

knowledge.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the first condition, 

and the package is clearly labeled, aren't there some 

commodities where UPS does have to pay attention to the 

label?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, yes, Your 

Honor. A Federal law -- there is Federal law with 

respect to shipment of hazardous substances. There are 

uniform requirements with respect to how one must label 

hazardous substances, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It can't be --

Ms. Brinkmann told us that they've got these -- so many 

packages and it's going to cost millions. But they do 

have to do it for a package that's labeled hazardous.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Not necessarily, as 

I understand the service. Some of -- many, many of the 

packages are delivered to a company with which UPS has a 

contract, such as a Staples or some other kind of store. 

And it becomes -- the Staples store becomes the shipper. 

They are the ones with the contract with UPS, not 

whoever it was that brought to it Staples. So it is not

that information at all.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. STERN: Thank you, Your Honor.

 Beginning with the last series of questions, 

if the Court looks at pages 100 to 102 of the joint 

appendix, the Court will see that UPS has a computer 

dial-up system which allows it to keep track of, and 

provide alerts for, shippers' addresses and consignees, 

as well as they can keep track of what is called an SIC 

code which is with respect to commodities. And they can 

keep track of tobacco commodities.

 There seems to be a misconception here, and 

I apologize for that. Maine's law is not a criminal 

law. It provides for civil violations between $50 and, 

I think, $1500.

 Regarding quantification, the only hard 

evidence in the record is that it costs UPS less than 

one cents a -- one cent a package to look at the label 

to determine whether a -- a particular name is 

problematic or not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Times 50.

 MR. STERN: Excuse me.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Times 50, because 49 other 

States would have different requirements, and all those 

requirements might -- might cost only a penny to comply 

with. But you add them all up, and it is half a buck.

MR. STERN: No, it is not, Your Honor. 

Because, as Ms. Brinkmann explained, the -- the looking 

at the label is done usually in UPS's situation by a 

preloader. And the preloader is in the particular 

State. So it still would be less than one cent a State 

for each State it happened to be in.

 The $2 a package is for the actual 

intercepted packages. In a five-month period, there 

were a total of 33 intercepted packages, and the 

citation to the record is at page 106.

 By no stretch of the imagination is there 

any proof in this record that it costs $32 million a 

year to comply with Maine's law.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Stern, when you say 

that it takes one second to -- I forget whether you said 

scan or -- or examine a label, do you -- are you 

describing simply the physical act of a human being 

looking at the label?

 MR. STERN: According to the testimony of 

Mr. Butler, who provided a document on this, it is 

looking at the label and determining whether it appears 

to be from a tobacco retailer.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You can't tell unless you 

have an extraordinary memory for all the names on the 

Attorney General's list. You can't do that simply by

looking at the label.

 And I -- I thought maybe what you meant by 

the one second was that the list was -- was in a 

computer, and you had a mechanical device that scanned 

the -- the name on the label and -- and it either 

matched something in the computer, or it didn't.

 But I take it you are talking about 

physical, visual inspection.

 MR. STERN: Yes. Your Honor's question 

raises two points. First, with respect to the names, 

if one goes and looks at the list of unlicensed tobacco 

retailers, virtually all of them have something like 

"tobacco" or "smokes" or something in it, because their 

goal is to be picked up by a Google search for somebody 

who is looking for cheap cigarettes and cheap tobacco.

 With respect to the computer system -- and 

the record is full of citations to it, for example, at 

pages 92 and 95 -- they have done a study of their 

computer system. They have not attempted in any way to 

research whether any of the companies on the list of 

unlicensed retailers is actually in their system so they 

can be picked up by the system.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I -- I just wanted to 

know what you meant by the "one second." I take it what 

you mean is there is a physical, visual inspection of

the label. And in that one second, in practical terms, 

the person looking can tell whether the name is on the

will alert him?

 MR. STERN: Yes. And if it is, it is put 

aside. And those are the 33 packages that were 

intercepted in a five-month period that cost --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But --

MR. STERN: -- UPS $2 a package.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If someone on the 

unapproved list wants to -- for whatever reason, wants 

to avoid a tipoff term like incorporating the term 

"tobacco" on to their label, then the person making the 

one-second inspection is not going to pick it up.

 And the only way the company is going to be 

able to protect itself against the imputed knowledge is 

either by a visual inspection of the Attorney General's 

list to see whether it matches what the person is 

looking at or by some computer scan, right?

 MR. STERN: The short answer is yes. If I

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.

Ms. Brinkmann and I have described. They did not study 

in any way, shape, or form how their computer system 

could streamline this and make it effective.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stern, I'd be 

interested in whether you have any response to the 

Government's point that, at least as far as 1555-D is 

concerned, that is a direct regulation of -- of the --

the shipper -- not the shipper, of the transporter. So 

that -- so that your point that this is not a regulation 

of -- of transport is simply -- is simply wrong as far 

as 1555-D is concerned. Do you acknowledge that?

 MR. STERN: Yes. We made that point with 

respect to 1555-C (3)(C).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. STERN: With respect to 1555-D, it is a 

direct regulation of the carrier services or any other 

delivery service which we believe is called for and 

permissible under the Synar Amendment, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Stern.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
