 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

in Case 09-1233, Schwarzenegger v. Plata, and the 

related cases.

 Mr. Phillips.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 What this Court has under review today is an 

extraordinary and unprecedented order issued by a three­

judge district court requiring the release of between 

36,000 and 45,000 inmates, currently incarcerated in the 

California penal system, within a 2-year period.

 The order in this particular case is made 

particularly remarkable because it strikes me that at a 

minimum it is extraordinarily premature. That -- it may 

come at some point in this process that an order, 

probably substantially smaller in scope than this one, 

may become appropriate. But if this is supposed to be 

an order or remedy of last resort, and what the district 

court has done here is leapfrogged a series of steps 

that should have been taken ahead of going this 

particular route.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: One case, Mr. Phillips, 

is pending for 20 years; is that not so?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, that's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it seems to me -- and 

there were something like 70 orders from the district 

court, the single-judge district court in that case.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That's absolutely true, 

Justice Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And no -- no change. So 

how much longer do we have to wait? Another 20 years? 

Longer than that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice Ginsburg. I 

think, obviously, the length of time you have to wait in 

some ways depends on what the state of the remedial 

phase is in the particular case. And in this case and 

in recognition, frankly, of the substantial problems 

that were inherent in the -- in the penal system as it 

existed during the 1990s and up until the early 2000s, a 

receiver was appointed, specifically in the Plata class, 

but there was also connections between the receiver and 

the special master even in the Coleman class before the 

three-judge panel was convened.

 And under those circumstances and given the 

extraordinary powers that the receiver had been

accorded, what should have -- the most logical course, 

if this is supposed to be a remedy of last resort, was 

to allow the receiver an opportunity to implement the 

extraordinary powers that were conferred upon him, and 

then see -- because if it turns out that we aren't 

making progress -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Could you 

tell me -- from your briefs, I just haven't understood 

what the alternative steps are. The court below talked 

about some proposals like construction and said the 

legislature has struck them down. There's -- the fiscal 

crisis has gotten worse, so construction is really not 

an option. I don't see how you wait for an option that 

doesn't exist. They talked about hiring more staff, but 

the conclusion was that even if you maximize the staff, 

you don't have the facilities to add more staff, which 

is what you need to cure the constitutional violation.

 So tell me what specific steps outside of 

this order should have been given time to be 

implemented, because the receiver has basically said: 

I've tried, and the small progress we made has been 

reversed because the population just keeps growing, so 

we can never get ahead of the problem.

rhetoric and give me concrete -­

MR. PHILLIPS: Sure.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- details about what 

the least restricted means would have been, other than 

to say, throw it back to a receiver and special master 

who are saying we don't have a solution outside 

of reducing overcrowding.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't think that's a fair 

characterization of what the receiver said. The 

receiver said that, at any population, he would in fact 

get you to the point -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, counsel, that was 

one statement years ago. If that's all you're relying 

on -­

MR. PHILLIPS: No, no. That's not all I'm 

relying on. All I'm suggesting -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That may be your weakest 

argument. Tell me -- give me concrete steps that are 

least -- less restrictive.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, if you -- all you have 

to do is look at what the receiver has done over the 

course of the period of time since his appointment, and 

particularly when the second receiver was put in place. 

First of all, A.B. 900 has been enacted. There is 

significant construction. There has been ground broken.

There are substantial facilities in place.

 Second, the receiver has had extraordinary 

success in the hiring process. They are -- we are at 

close to 90 percent -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there in fact less 

overcrowding? Because I thought that the -- what this 

case was all about was the receiver has said, the 

special master has said, we can't make any progress at 

all until there are fewer people; we have no place to 

put clinics.

 The first step, not the last step, but given 

the -- given what we're dealing with here, the essential 

first step is that we have fewer people so there is more 

room for these health facilities, more room for staff to 

operate.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, the 

fundamental issue in this case seems to me as -- what is 

the real cause of the constitutional violation here? 

And the real cause of the constitutional violation here 

has always been the culture of disregard for the inmate. 

What the receiver was put in place for, the reason he 

was appointed, and properly so -- this was with the 

State's consent; this is not over our objection -- was 

to change that fundamental culture and to provide, one, 

construction, to provide increased numbers, to

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you can't -- you 

can't provide construction when the State doesn't supply 

the money for it.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Except that since the 

August 8th, 2008, period of time, you know, literally 

hundreds of millions of dollars have gone to 

construction specifically and more than $4 billion have 

been spent on the provision of health care in this 

particular system. And a great deal of that is because 

of the receiver.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then if you -- then if 

there -- if there are these great changes in 

circumstances so that now they -- medical care can be 

administered in something approaching a decent way, you 

could go back to the single-judge district court and 

say: I'm moving under 60(b). Circumstances have 

changed; it's no longer the case that it's impossible to 

render decent health care.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, I don't 

think we could get that relief from the single-judge 

district court, unless you're asking me to actually seek 

to remove the entirety of the claim. I mean, the order 

that says that we have to get to 137.5 percent of the 

design, the design capacity, within 2 years is a

three-judge district court decision.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you go back to that 

panel because it invited you to. It said if 

circumstances change, come back.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but that will always 

be the case, Justice Sotomayor. The fundamental 

question here is: Congress shifted dramatically the 

approach that you're supposed to take as a court of 

equity in this context. This is supposed to be a matter 

of last resort, which would mean that you would give the 

receiver a full opportunity to do what the receiver -­

JUSTICE BREYER: The receiver said the best 

statement that seemed to me to summarize it. It's in 

his brief on page 9. He has about two paragraphs. And 

as you read that two paragraphs, it sounds as if 

overcrowding is a big, big cause of this problem, which 

is horrendous, which if you think it's accurately 

described in the mental case in the first page, two 

paragraphs -- now, if that's a fair description from the 

record, it's a horrendous problem.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well -­

JUSTICE BREYER: What the receiver says is 

overcrowding is a big cause of it. And then he says: 

think we've discovered you actually can provide care, 

and certainly our plan and turnaround plan believes we

can provide constitutional levels of care no matter what 

the population is.

 So then you look to the care and turnaround 

plan and it says spend $8 billion building more 

buildings. And then the legislature rejected it. Okay?

 MR. PHILLIPS: And then -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, there we are. More 

time; what's supposed to happen?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, but, Justice Breyer, the 

legislature also approved a smaller but nevertheless 

multibillion-dollar construction program.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, it was 2.31 or 

something like that.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I mean, they 

approved -­

JUSTICE BREYER: And did they approve the 

2.3 -- is that in place, 2.35? 	 Did they approve that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, they did approve that -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So he said: We need 

8 -­

MR. PHILLIPS: -- and that money is being 

spent.

JUSTICE BREYER: And is there any evidence 

here that suggests that 2.35 is sufficient to cure the 

constitutional violation?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know whether it 

will get you there or not.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So I take it from your 

answer the answer is no, there is no evidence.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there is the evidence 

that the receiver asked for contempt for not getting the 

8 billion and withdrew that motion. So, obviously, 

there is some sense in which the receiver is reasonably 

satisfied with 2.35 billion as an opening gambit.

 But, again, all of this goes to what is, at 

least from my perspective, the fundamental question the 

court should have evaluated in the first instance, which 

is: Are we ready yet to give up hope at this point?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what he says -- what 

the receiver says about the 2.35, that it is a 

significant step farther. It is certainly better than 

no construction at all. However, that is not equivalent 

to a conclusion that that current compromise will result 

in sustainable constitutional health care at current 

population density levels.

 That's what he said about it. So -- so we 

have his views, and I'm back to my question: What else

is supposed to happen?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there's -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Which was your question 

initially.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer, when the 

receiver says that -- now remember, he says at current 

population levels. He doesn't suggest, and his brief is 

very clear, that it doesn't urge this Court to affirm 

the particular order in this case.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Phillips -­

MR. PHILLIPS: Can I -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Yes.

 MR. PHILLIPS: -- just finish this?

 And the reality is that the population 

levels have dropped pretty significantly since August, 

since the trial in this particular case. And given the 

actions by the legislature in A.B. 18 and the actions of 

the legislatures in A.B. 900, there are both a lot of 

expenditures on the table and substantial reductions in 

the population size. And so, therefore, even under the 

receiver's -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- do we have 

information about that substantial reduction? I mean, 

in this record, it just seems to be that it's -- no 

matter how many efforts have been made, the population

goes up. And now you say that the population has gone 

down. From what point in time and how much has it gone 

down?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it's down to around, as 

I understand it, about 147,000 from a high of around 165 

to 170,000, and it has dropped, as we know, because 

there has been a change in the good time credits. There 

has been a significant number of transfers. I mean, 

that was the purpose of the governor's proclamation 

declaring an emergency.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's possible that 

within the 2-year period, you're going to hit the mark 

if you -- that's what the lower court's -­

MR. PHILLIPS: I think it unlikely.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what the 

three-judge panel said, which is: If you implement most 

of the proposals being made, you are likely to hit the 

mark. So what you're saying is you're going to do it. 

And if you don't, they invited you to come back and -­

you really don't think that if you hit 140 percentage, 

that the court is going to order an immediate release of 

the 2.5 percent over the limit it set? It's going to 

ask you: What have you put into place to reach that 

level over what additional period of time?

of federalism answer and then a basic sort of factual 

point to be made here. Let me make the second one 

first, and then I want to come back to the -- what you 

may regard as rhetorical, but nevertheless I think 

important, which is that when we made our initial 

proposal to the three-judge court suggesting what we 

thought would be a reasonable reduction within a 

reasonable period of time, it was met with both a motion 

for contempt and summary rejection out of hand, 

notwithstanding that there was improvement at the 

time -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what are we fighting 

about? Are we fighting about that the plan was wrong, 

or are we fighting about that you're angry that you were 

told to do it in 2 years -- in 22 years, as opposed to 

do it in 25 years? Is that -- is that what you're 

objecting to?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No. I think the -- no, this 

goes to the federalism point.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can -- can you do it in 

5 years?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know. I -- you know, 

if -- if balancing all of the policies that the State 

has to take into account, can it get there and is that 

in the best interest of the State of California? If it

is, yes, then we can get there.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, the best interest 

of the State of California, isn't it to deliver adequate 

constitutional care to the people that it incarcerates? 

That's a constitutional obligation.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely. And California 

recognizes that.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So when are you going to 

get to that? When are you going to avoid the needless 

deaths that were reported in this record? When are you 

going to avoid or get around people sitting in their 

feces for days in a dazed state? When are you going to 

get to a point where you're going to deliver care that 

is going to be adequate?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But don't be rhetorical.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I'll do my best. Thank you, 

Your Honor.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. PHILLIPS: I mean, first of all, let's 

-- you know, if you look at the receiver's 2009 death 

review which came out in September 2010, it specifically 

says that there has been a significant downward trend 

over the past 4 years. The suicides -- the 25 suicides 

in '09 were 66 percent of the average for the preceding 

3 years, and the 9 homicides were 60 percent of the

average. There have been significant improvements.

 And the more important point in response to 

your specific question, Justice Sotomayor, is that the 

record in this case was cut off in August of 2008, and 

so what we have are -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, but the problem 

I have with that, Mr. Phillips, is that at some point 

the court has to say: You've been given enough time; 

the constitutional violation still persists, as the 

State itself acknowledges.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm not sure we've 

stated that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Overcrowding is the 

principal -- overcrowding is the principal cause, as 

experts have testified, and it's now time for a remedy.

 The court can't -- has to at some point 

focus on the remedy, and that's what it did, and that, 

it seemed to me, was a perfectly reasonable decision.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Kennedy, I agree with 

everything you say except -- and I even agree with the 

last statement, because, you know, you needed a 

significant remedy. There's no question about it. But 

you got a significant remedy when the receiver was 

appointed in 2005 and implemented a program in 2006.

plan and to try to implement his plan?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there's no -- Justice 

Kagan, there's no specific time frame. I mean, 

obviously, we believe that we are entitled to a 

reasonable opportunity to comply with the receiver's 

orders and to bring ourselves ultimately into compliance 

with the Constitution, and -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, at some point the 

State itself said that if it had, I think, 7 years, it 

could get down to 137.5 and didn't seem to object to 

that.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, that's --

Justice Kennedy, you know, given all of the other 

constraints, et cetera -- again, there's a fundamental 

difference between what you do under the hammer of a 

district court order, which is what we have under these 

circumstances, and what the State will do. That said, 

the State is absolutely committed.

 I mean, the -- again, to go back to what is 

the root cause of the constitutional violation, it's not 

overcrowding. I mean, when California violated the 

constitutional rights of the mentally ill in the 1990s,

the prisons weren't crowded. It was because there was a 

fundamental lack of attentiveness to medical care under 

those circumstances. And that's unfortunate, to be 

sure. More than that.

 But that was the reason. To go back to your 

point, Justice Kennedy, that's why the receiver, which 

is an extraordinary remedy. To confer upon a private 

individual the entire authority to run the California 

Department of Corrections, not just simply a facility or 

anything like that, but the entire Department of 

Corrections' medical and -- medical health provision, is 

incredible.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that 

officer himself said: I can't do this without as a 

first step reducing the population; nothing else is 

going to work until we reduce the population to the 

point where there is room for clinics, room for medical 

personnel to operate. I mean, that was the view of the 

district judge, the special master in one case, the 

receiver in the other case.

 Everybody -- they all agreed reducing the 

population is not going to cure it, not going to make 

everything perfect, but without doing that as a first 

step, nothing -- there will be no cure.

if you accept that, and I don't think that's precisely 

how I would interpret what the receiver said under these 

circumstances anyway, but even if you accept that, the 

idea of a 137-1/2 percent design cap that has to be 

implemented within fewer than 2 years is a remedy that's 

neither necessary nor sufficient. It is not aimed at 

the specific class. It doesn't remedy the specific 

Federal rights as required by the Prisoners Litigation 

Reform Act.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't get the class 

thing, because what -- you can't have a remedy just 

limited to the class. The class wants to have clinics. 

They want to have personnel who function someplace 

outside of a broom closet. So you can't deal with this 

problem by just dealing with the mentally ill and the 

people with medical problems. You have to provide space 

for facilities.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I think, Justice Ginsburg, 

the -- the fundamental point here is that it may 

eventually be that you have to get to that stage, but if 

you look at the receiver's reports since August 2008, 

which consistently analyzed this issue, and they say: 

And we have been able successfully to bring in very 

qualified personnel, and we have significantly larger 

numbers; we know there is construction in place; it may

not be as substantial as what I originally proposed; it 

is nevertheless very significant.

 And -- and Congress was very explicit that 

the remedy of a prisoner release order should be the 

remedy of last resort.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What would I look at to 

find this? It's a big record. What I did was I -- it 

refers to on-line evidence, and I went and looked at the 

pictures, and the pictures are pretty horrendous to me. 

And I would say page 10 of the religious group's brief, 

for example, shows you one of them.

 And what they're saying is, it's -- it's 

obvious. Just look at it. You cannot have mental 

health facilities that will stop people from killing 

themselves and you cannot have medical facilities that 

will stop staph and tubercular infection in conditions 

like this. And then you look at them.

 Now, you've looked at them. I've looked at 

them. And what is the answer to that? There's nothing 

in here that -- the special master said $8 billion is 

the answer.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well -­

close. So how can I -- or you if you were in my

that these three judges who have 200 pages of 

findings -- what would you say to -- as an answer to 

what I just said?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I would say that the 

Prisoners Litigation Reform Act has a series of very 

specific requirements that the Federal court has to 

comply with, and that in deciding to go to a three-judge 

district court in the first instance, you have to 

examine the orders that are in place and whether those 

orders have had a reasonable time within which to 

operate. And -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but the State -- the 

State did not claim that either order in either case has 

succeeded in achieving a remedy. You've never claimed 

that.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it depends on what you 

mean by -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and just if I could 

have your attention for a moment. I have this problem 

with the case: Overcrowding is, of course, always the 

cause. If I'm running a hotel -- if I'm looking at a 

highway system, I need highways, what's the number of 

cars? If the problem is bad service in a hotel, well, 

it's the number of employees per -- per guest. I mean, 

that's fairly simple.

Now, I recognize, of course, that Congress 

has -- had imposed a special duty on us. But I think it 

means that overcrowding must not be ordered unless that 

is the only efficacious remedy in -- in a permissible 

period of time. And it seems to me there is massive 

expert testimony to support that proposition on the part 

of -- of the prisoners.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I mean, it seems to me 

that, first of all, I'm not sure that's consistent with 

the language. It's the primary cause of the 

constitutional violation, not the primary impediment to 

the implementation of a specific remedy. So I think 

that's still a difficult and open question as to how to 

proceed.

 But it still strikes me that the sequence 

that Congress envisions and the one that would make the 

most sense and ultimately the one that hopefully would 

accommodate both the plaintiffs' interests and the 

State's interests, and the Department of Corrections' 

interests, is to allow the receiver to stay on a course 

that candidly I think will in fact get you there.

 I mean, again, one of the real flaws in this 

case, Justice Kennedy, is nobody doubts for a moment 

that there have been very significant violations of 

constitutional rights years gone by and, indeed, a

failure on the mental health side ultimately to get you

significant remedy.

 The reality is, is that in the course of the 

last 3 to 4 years under the guidance of the -- of the 

receiver, who coordinates with the special master on the 

mental health side and does it with the cooperation of 

the State of California, there have been significant -­

there has been significant movement in the right 

direction.

 And if the court had not jumped the gun and

used. You had quoted his statements.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, to be sure, although, 

candidly, we had -- we had referred to some of those 

same statements even in the jurisdictional statement in 

this litigation. This has been part of the case for 

quite some time.

 So I -- I don't know what motivated the 

special master to file an out-of-time brief -- or I 

mean, the receiver to file an out-of-time brief. But I 

understand -- you know, we didn't object to it so long 

as the Court was of a mind to hear from the receiver.

 But I do think the most important part of 

that, though, to keep in mind in this context is the 

receiver didn't ask for this Court to affirm. The 

receiver simply clarified certain statements that had 

been made and tried to say, as Justice Alito described, 

put them into some kind of context. And that's -- and 

that's fine, and we obviously don't have any quarrel 

with -- with that particular presentation.

 But I do think to say that the receiver has 

insisted that he cannot get to a constitutionally 

permissible result without the order that has been 

imposed in this particular case is -- is simply not 

consistent with either the record and certainly not 

consistent with that amicus brief.

concludes that it was appropriate to convene it, but 

137-1/2 percent is not narrowly tailored, it would be a 

different one. Either way, it will go back, obviously, 

to a court of equity. The receiver is in place. The 

receiver has a comprehensive plan in place which he is 

implementing as we speak.

 I mean, you know, one of the things that -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's one piece of it. 

You said something about the 2.35 million. They didn't 

come up with the 8 million, but they did come up with 

2.35 billion. And then I'm just looking at this brief 

for the receiver, and there's a footnote, page 11, 

footnote 3, that says: No, that money isn't there; it's 

dependent upon several approvals that have not yet been 

secured, and such approvals ultimately may not be 

forthcoming.

it has already been spent. The rest of it has already 

been earmarked for this particular purpose, and there is

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the receiver is saying 

it's not etched in stone. I understand that. But our 

assumption and our expectation and our belief is that 

that money is going to be used for construction. There 

are projects that are finished, there are projects that 

are under way, and there are project that are scheduled 

to begin within the next 6 weeks, all of which will be 

funded out of that $2.35 billion.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: On one project, the joint 

legislative budget committee said, no, we're not going 

to give you money for that.

 MR. PHILLIPS: They asked for additional 

information, to be sure. But the expectation, again, 

from the governor, both this governor and the 

governor-elect, is that that money will ultimately be 

approved and that that facility would be built. And 

we're moving along very rapidly to get that construction 

under way, because we're talking about enormous 

facilities under these particular circumstances, Justice

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, my trouble 

listening to you is that it seems as though you're 

asking us to re-find facts. You know, you have these 

judges who have been involved in these cases since the 

beginning, for 20 years in the Plata case, who thought: 

We've done everything we can, the receiver has done 

everything he can; this just isn't going anywhere and it 

won't go anywhere until we can address this root cause 

of the problem.

 And that was the view of the judges who had 

been closest to the cases from the beginning and the 

view of the three-judge court generally. So how can we 

reach a result essentially without, you know, re-finding 

the facts that they've been dealing with for 20 years?

 MR. PHILLIPS: The -- there -- the 

fundamental problem with the fact-finding in this -­

well, there are actually two fundamental problems. 

First of all, remember that the receiver gets appointed, 

and then 3 months later you get a motion for a 

three-judge court. The three-judge court convenes 

itself before the receiver has even finalized the 

comprehensive plan to bring everybody into compliance in 

the first instance.

 So the reality is that's -- that's the

fundamental legal error I'm asking this Court to 

correct. But even if you get beyond that and you're 

looking at the primary cause analysis, it seems to me 

that's -- that's at most -- at best, a mixed question of 

law and fact, and it's the kind of standard that this 

Court ought to analyze to determine in the first 

instance and on an independent review whether or not the 

overcrowding is, quote, "the primary cause of the 

violation."

 And what makes that inquiry particularly 

appropriate for this Court, as opposed to simply 

slavishly adhering -- deferring to the district court in 

this circumstance, is that the district court 

arbitrarily cut off the record in August of '08 and 

there have been enormous developments since then. And 

there were enormous developments -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain me 

something about that? It was confusing in the briefs, 

Mr. Phillips. I thought that the State had said: We 

don't want the plaintiffs to tour these facilities 

anymore. We don't want to have discovery go beyond -­

what was it -- some date in 2008.

 I thought that it was the State that was 

urging: We don't need any more discovery, we don't want 

any more inspection tours.

So how could -- how could the plaintiffs

enough, 2008 should be the cutoff?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there's a huge 

difference between not allowing formal tours and all of 

the rigamarole that goes with that, which is what the 

State specifically objected to. But what the State 

wanted to do and what the intervenors on our side in 

even greater vehemence wanted to do was to bring forward 

evidence that proved that in the interim period of time 

there have been, in fact, significant improvements.

 As I sit here today, Justice Kennedy, you 

said it's conceded that we're -- that we're in 

constitutional violation. It is conceded that we have 

been in constitutional violation. I don't know whether 

today we are in violation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then don't you have 

the burden? If -- if you have -- you concede that you 

have been in constitutional violation, then it seems to 

me you have the burden of showing that's no longer the

understand what the ordinary rule would be in a -- of a 

court of equity dealing with a constitutional violation. 

But we're talking about an order entered under the 

Prisoners Litigation Reform Act, and it's quite clear, 

the statute couldn't be any plainer, that it shifts the 

burden significantly onto the plaintiff when you are 

going to go for a remedy as extreme as insisting that 

somewhere between potentially 36,000 and 45,000 inmates 

be released within a -- within a 2-year period of time.

 Again, if you go back, you know, the 

receiver has not -- at the time that all of this took 

place, the receiver had been appointed. The receiver 

had devised a plan. The receiver is currently spending 

an enormous amount of money, $4 billion on health care, 

to get -- to get the system moving in the right 

direction, with the right attitude, in order to bring 

ourselves without question into constitutional 

compliance. The truth is we haven't really had an 

assessment of where we are in the constitutional 

compliance spectrum.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe -- you're 

talking about one of the cases, but the other one -- and 

it's the newer one, instituted in 2001. But what about 

the one that started out in 1990?

much -- a much more serious problem. I don't doubt 

that. But it seems -- and if the Court were to conclude 

ultimately that Coleman ought to go back for another 

analysis based on the problems there, I could understand 

that. And it would be a very different prisoner release 

order under those circumstances because then you'd have 

to take out all of the evidence with respect to Plata 

and let that play out.

 But even that, it seems to me, would be a 

mistake under these circumstances where the special 

master and the receiver have been in a sense joined at 

the hip in a variety of ways. And it only makes sense, 

because the -- the receiver is controlling the provision 

of medical care in the CDCR and the special master is 

taking care of or trying to promote a very small slice 

of that.

 So in the scheme of things, as you might 

expect, the receiver consistently gets the ultimate 

authority to make the decisions to help provide the kind 

of resources, both in quality and quantity and staff and 

construction and access to health care.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, this issue 

about evidence -- did you proffer to the judge anywhere 

in this record what the additional evidence it was that 

you wanted to show? I know that the decrease in

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you run the prisons. 

I presume that you could have yourself without discovery 

set forth a proffer for the court that says: We had a 

wait time between diagnosis and treatment that was 

60 days, 90 days, 120 days in the past, and we've 

reduced that down now to 2 weeks or whatever the reality 

is.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

And when the intervenor's counsel stood up in the

today as opposed to where it was way back when, the 

three-judge court, or at least one member of the

point.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that the district 

court invited you to proffer that evidence that went to

Amendment. Instead, it said: We'll take whatever you 

have to proffer to show that the remedy is 

inappropriate.

Sotomayor, there is, to my mind at least, a complete 

disconnect by saying, I'm not going to tell you exactly 

where the constitutional violation is today, we're not

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD SPECTER

 ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

 MR. SPECTER: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 For 20 years, the overcrowding crisis has 

caused prisoners suffering from psychosis and 

life-threatening illnesses to languish in their cells 

because treatment facilities have no room for them. 

Prisoners are committing suicide at a rate twice the 

national average, and more than two-thirds of those 

suicides are preventable. The absence of -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you talking about 

current figures or past? Tell us the date of the 

figures.

 MR. SPECTER: Sure. That's from the trial 

court's opinion, Your Honor. That's from the record.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I thought. 

How do you address your adversary's point -­

MR. SPECTER: Yes, ma'am.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that the adequacy of 

a remedy can't be measured unless you measure the state

of the situation at the time the remedy is imposed?

 MR. SPECTER: Well, I think, Your Honor, 

there was massive amounts of evidence about the 

constitutional violations that existed at the time that 

the remedy was imposed. And if we -- I can point to the 

jurisdictional statement 1 appendix, page 30a, the court 

said: "Nonetheless, as we describe below, fundamental 

unconstitutional deficiencies caused primarily by 

overcrowding continue to exist and" -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't take any 

evidence on the point, I thought.

 MR. SPECTER: No, Your Honor. I'm sorry, 

that's not correct, with all respect. They took massive 

amounts of evidence up to the day of trial about all the 

conditions as they relate to the remedy. And those 

conditions were -­

captured it. What the three-judge panel said is: Look, 

we're not going to -- you can't -- this isn't the place 

for you to come in and say everything's fine, it's -­

everything's constitutional.

 What the three-judge court did say is: We 

will consider -- and they did, in fact, consider -- all 

the evidence from the State. They had experts from the 

State, two of the prisons, in August of 2008. Those 

experts wrote reports, they testified, and they've 

testified about the conditions current. And one of 

them from the mental health side said -­

one-judge court, in the district court, wasn't it?

 MR. SPECTER: No, no. In the three-judge 

court -- the three-judge court closed evidence in 

December of 2008. We then argued the case after the 

post-trial briefing in February of 2009. Then the court 

came out with the tentative decision about 20 days 

later, and then in August of 2009, it issued the 

183-page opinion and the order that's at issue here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did -- I'm sorry. 

Let me just keep track here.

 The evidence was cut off when in 2008?

 MR. SPECTER: The trial closed in December 

of 2008, after all the parties had submitted all their 

evidence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. So -­

MR. SPECTER: Then there was post-trial 

briefing for a month. Then we had argument in 

February of that year. And then a few weeks later, they

case.

the intervenors -- that between October 2006 and October 

2010, the population of the adult facilities declined by 

14,832 inmates?

 MR. SPECTER: Well, I -- I agree with my 

friend Mr. Phillips that the population has declined by 

about 10,000 prisoners. Most of that decline has been 

due to a transfer to out-of-State prisons, and, true, 

there's some -- some amount of it has been as a result 

of the marginal increase in good time credits, which the 

State elected to pursue on its own.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the argument 

that there was evidence that should have been admitted 

but that was not, with reference to new construction?

 MR. SPECTER: Well, I don't -- there was no 

evidence that wasn't -- that was offered that wasn't 

considered by the three-judge panel, Your Honor. They 

considered all the evidence. Their 183-page opinion is 

scrupulous in considering all the evidence, both that 

supported the order and they distinguished the evidence 

and, in fact, made credibility determinations based on 

the evidence that -- that was contrary. But -­

constitutional violations relating to the provision of 

medical care in general and treatment for -- for mental 

illness?

 My understanding of the 137.5 percent figure 

is that that has to do with the total number of 

prisoners in the -- in the system in relation to design 

capacity; isn't that right?

 MR. SPECTER: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, what does the ruling -­

that doesn't speak to the number of personnel who are 

available in the system to attend to medical needs or 

mental illness. It doesn't speak to the extent of the 

facilities that are available for those purposes. It 

seems to be -- there seems to be a disconnect between 

those two. Could you explain why that is narrowly 

tailored?

 MR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor. There was -­

the court made findings that 137.5 percent was the 

maximum number of prisoners that -- of the capacity, of 

the design capacity of the prison, that the prison could 

have that would enable the State to provide -- to have

facilities, medication management -- be effective and

 JUSTICE ALITO: See, that's what I don't 

understand. You can have a -- could you not have a 

prison where the cells are somewhat crowded -- and 137.5 

percent of design capacity is not -­

MR. SPECTER: Right.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- is not unconstitutional 

in itself, is it?

 MR. SPECTER: No, it remedies -­

JUSTICE ALITO: You could have -­

MR. SPECTER: It's a remedy, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Or you could have a prison 

where the -- the cells themselves are crowded, and yet 

there are other facilities available for medical care 

and plenty of staff to attend to those things. So 

what's the connection?

 MR. SPECTER: Well, that's -- that's -- and 

you're right. If there were -- if the cells were 

crowded but the prison had all the other facilities 

available, then there might not be a problem. You have 

to -- well, I hope you can understand that in this case, 

the prisons were built to double-cell the prisoners, but 

they weren't built to provide 200 percent of health care 

needs. So as soon as they started to double-cell these 

prisoners, they could meet their literal housing needs

in the space of the cell, but they couldn't meet the 

needs of their health care.

 And that's why, Your Honor, the 

137.5 percent figure is reasonable, because the Court 

went almost a third overcrowding above what all the 

experts recommended.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But why order the release of 

around 40,000 prisoners, many of whom, perhaps the great 

majority of whom, are not going to be within a class in 

either of these lawsuits? Why order the release of all 

those people, rather than ordering the provision of the 

construction of facilities for medical care, facilities 

to treat mental illness, hiring of staff to treat mental 

illness? Why not go directly to the problem rather than 

address what seems to be a different issue altogether?

 MR. SPECTER: Well, I have two responses to 

that, and they're both a little separate.

 The first point: It's important to 

understand that this is not a release order. It's a 

population-crowding reduction order. The court is not 

ordering the State to throw open the gates of its doors 

and release people. They can reduce crowding through 

more transfers to out of State. To your construction 

point, if the State so chooses, it can construct new 

facilities to increase the capacity. And the

 The point about -­

JUSTICE ALITO: If all they do is to build 

more cells, they're not going to address the problem. 

So I -­

MR. SPECTER: Exactly. So that goes to the 

second part of your question, which is: Why don't they 

try other things, like ordering the prisons to hire more 

doctors, ordering better medication management, all of 

those kinds of things? And the answer to that is in the 

appendix to the Appellee's Coleman brief, which lists 70 

discrete orders which the Coleman court, single-judge 

Coleman court, tried over a period of 15 years, which 

have proven singularly to be ineffective. And that's 

why the court analyzed all those things; the trial court 

analyzed all these things, and it made a finding of fact 

that based on the statements by the special master, by 

the receiver's reports, and by the general state of the 

horrendous conditions which we have in these prisons, 

that those discrete orders would not solve the problem. 

And given the level of harm -­

JUSTICE ALITO: I -- I still don't get it. 

You're saying that they were ordered to do a variety of 

things that directly address the problem and they didn't

 JUSTICE ALITO: In order to -- in order to 

provide some kind of a remedy, we're going to order 

something else that doesn't address the problem -­

MR. SPECTER: No, that -­

JUSTICE ALITO: -- that these lawsuits aim 

at addressing.

 MR. SPECTER: No, Your Honor. To the 

contrary, Justice Alito, we -- I think the court 

believes based on the facts that it found that this 

would be an effective remedy. All of the testimony that 

they heard from experts from Texas, from Pennsylvania, 

from Washington State -- all of whom had suffered, had 

dealt with crowding in their prison systems, have said 

that when you reduce the crowding, that's the critical 

thing that you have to do now, because unless you reduce 

the crowding, nothing else is going to work. And the 

court found that that was exactly true.

 Nothing else over 20 years in one case and 

over 8 years in another case has worked. And -- and 

all -- as Justice Kennedy said, massive amounts of 

evidence show that the primary reason it hasn't worked 

is one singular word, overcrowding; and when you reduce 

overcrowding, the prison will be able to operate and

will be able to provide those services that it can't

 There will be less prisoners, so officers 

will be able to take them from one place to another to 

get treatment. There won't be so many lockdowns, which 

inhibit care.

of addressing the problem, and it has collateral 

consequences. If -- if I were a citizen of California,

crime -­

of that was, the number of murders, the number of rapes, 

the number of armed robberies, the number of assaults. 

You don't -- that's not going to happen in California?

 MR. SPECTER: Your Honor, this trial court 

found, based on 50 pages of its opinion, based on expert 

testimony not only from our experts but from the State's 

experts, from the intervenors' experts, they all came to 

the unanimous conclusion that there are methods that -­

by which you can reduce crowding which will not increase 

crime and that are safe.

 The Secretary of the Department of 

Corrections who was the secretary at the time of trial 

so testified that he was in favor, for example, of 

increasing prisoners' good time credits. That's one way 

to reduce crowding.

 And, moreover, there was statistical 

evidence saying -- looking at all the other States that 

had reduced their prison population over a period of 

about 15 years, and they all came to the same 

conclusion, all of those studies came to the same 

conclusion, which is there's no -- there is no increase

to reduce crowding. The governor himself wanted to 

reduce the prison population by 37,000. That was in one 

of his legislative enactments, and the secretary of 

corrections testified that those proposals were safe.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did he want to do it 

within the 2-year period the district court ordered?

 MR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor, he did. He 

submitted legislation to the legislature for that, and

5 years -­

 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- without any public safety 

problem? So why don't we let them take those 5 years?

 MR. SPECTER: Because, Your Honor, as 

Justice Ginsburg and others have been saying before, the 

constitutional violations have been ongoing for 

20 years. We're dealing here with cases of life and 

death and serious injury. And after all these years, in 

-- when they -- when they heard the evidence that said 

that population could be -- and they made the findings 

which the State doesn't argue are clearly erroneous -­

about conditions, some of the conditions current as of 

the day of the -- of the testimony. So it was very 

current, and nothing was excluded. That way, even if 

the court made a ruling which was error, which we don't 

believe it was, there was absolutely no prejudice.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What is -- what is the 

number? I mean, I -- I was puzzled by the same thing 

that Justice Sotomayor was. I read, on page 253 of the 

appendix, a conclusion where the district court said it 

is our conclusion that they can reduce this by how many 

people? What is it -- 30,000? It's a lot.

 MR. SPECTER: Thirty-five thousand.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Thirty-five thousand. That 

this could be done safely.

 MR. SPECTER: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Preceding page, whatever 

that was -- I have it -- it was 253.

 MR. SPECTER: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: There are about six pages 

where they summarize evidence from all kinds of 

criminologists that say, for example, there are 17,000 

technical parole violators that are being sent to prison 

who haven't committed additional crimes, and they could 

perhaps be released from some of the time that they're 

spending in prison. Then they go on to this good time,

be releasing the minimum amount -­

purposes of the remedy order. There was substantial

was necessary.

 MR. SPECTER: No, I -- I respectfully 

disagree with the record, Your Honor. The 145 figure 

came from a report by the former governor, Deukmejian, 

and a group that he organized, and they said that they 

could operate a crowded system at 145 percent of 

capacity. And that figure was high, the district court 

found, because it didn't take into account health care 

needs.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -­

MR. SPECTER: It didn't take into account 

health care needs, which is the issue here. And our 

experts testified that, because it didn't take into 

account health care needs, 130 percent was the -- was 

the better number. It's the number that the strike team 

had thought of, the -- the administration's own strike 

team. It is the number that these professional experts 

believed would be sufficient to remedy the population.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the experts -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The experts that -- who 

were testifying were quite aware of the fact that 

overcrowding related to the constitutional violations. 

That was their whole theory.

 MR. SPECTER: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And any number of them 

suggested that 145 would be sufficient.

 MR. SPECTER: I think there might have been 

only one; one expert suggested 145. Most of -- I think 

most -- the majority of the experts suggested 130. The 

court found -- and it has not been challenged here as 

clearly erroneous -- that the weight of the evidence 

went to 130. They wanted to do what you're saying, 

which was minimize the intrusion, maximize the 

population. So to -- even though they -- the court had 

ample basis to issue an order saying it should be 130, 

they said in an abundance of caution and to give -- to 

give the State the benefit of the doubt and to make 

sure, we're going to bump it up an extra 7.5 percent.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And did he say that at 

145 you could deliver health care safely?

 MR. SPECTER: He was equivocal on that 

point. He thought -- he said that at the outer reaches 

it might be true.

 But I want to emphasize that the district 

court has allowed the State to come back in at any time 

to modify its order and to modify this percentage point 

if the circumstances changed. So, since the -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Specter, there -­

there has been at least two significant changes. One is 

the good time credit. The California legislature did 

pass the law that upped the good time credits and also 

addressing the probationers and the parolees -­

violators to divert them from the system. Do you have 

any information about what effect that legislation that

year. I think it went into effect in July of last year,

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, do we -- do we know 

at all what effect it has had?

 MR. SPECTER: It has had a marginal effect 

on reducing the population. There have been no reports 

that it has led to an increase in crime.

 But to get back to my earlier point and your 

point, Justice Kennedy, about the -- the remedy and that 

it should be the least intrusive possible. This order 

is set to take effect over a 2-year period, and during 

that 2-year period, if Mr. Phillips is correct that the 

conditions are constitutional and that they can deliver 

services at 145 percent, then the State is free to come 

in and make a motion to -- to bring those changed 

circumstances to the court. And, if anything, this 

court has been incredibly sensitive to the -- to the 

needs and desires of the State, and it -- it was 

extremely reluctant to enter this order in the first 

place, and it would -- and it would bend over backwards 

to give the State discretion while attempting to -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I don't see a finding 

by the three-judge court that 145, is it, would not be 

an efficacious remedy. I know that it -­

 MR. SPECTER: Yes, Your Honor. I don't 

think -- I don't think it's explicitly said 145, but I 

think it discussed the 145 figure in the context of the 

-- of the fact that it didn't provide for health care 

services. So it discounted that a little bit and went 

down about 7 percent. But it came close to that figure, 

I believe.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask you a 

hypothetical question that I know is not your case? But 

let's say you had the district court entering an order 

saying you have to bring it down to 137.5 in 2 years. 

That will, as a practical matter, result in the release 

of 40,000 prisoners. The State comes back and makes a 

showing supported by experts saying, look, if you give 

us 4 years, we can reach the figure without releasing 

any prisoners.

 Do you think it would violate the Prison 

Litigation Reform Act for the district court to say: 

No, I want this done in 2 years, not 4 years, and we'll 

just have to deal with the fact there are going to be 

40,000 prisoners out on the streets.

implications of its decision. So, under those 

circumstances, it's -- under those hypothetical 

circumstances, there's always the possibility that, in 

those cases, the degree of public safety problems might 

outweigh the harm.

 That -- as you said, that's not this case. 

They found that we could do it. And they -- the 

three-judge panel found that the State could reduce the 

population safely. And there was no suggestion in -- in 

the record that this 2- or 4-year period would make that 

much of a difference.

 You have to put the 40,000 or 35,000 figure 

in context. California releases 120,000 prisoners every 

year on parole. That's a lot of prisoners. And the 

findings of the district courts are, even when 

California increases the number of parolees in the 

communities, that doesn't increase the crime rate.

State to say this is where I'm going to put my money.

through -­

now it's being transferred from the State legislature to 

Federal district courts throughout the State.

 MR. SPECTER: Well, I believe the Federal 

courts have an obligation to enforce the Constitution 

and the laws of the United States.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I believe 

that as well, counsel.

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What I'm saying is 

that you have conflicting orders from different district 

courts telling them you've got to comply with the 

Constitution by spending 8 billion here; and another

court saying, I've got another constitutional problem of 

my own, and you've got to spend 8 billion over there. 

What is the State supposed to do in that situation?

 MR. SPECTER: Well, my simple answer to your 

question, Your Honor -- and I don't mean to be 

flippant -- but they're -- they have an obligation to 

follow the Federal law, constitutional law and other 

laws. And if they're not, then the Federal court has an 

obligation to impose a remedy.

 In this particular case, the State has a 

choice. It can either incarcerate 140,000 prisoners in 

a system built for 80,000, or it can incarcerate a -- a 

lesser number. If it chooses to incarcerate 148,000 

prisoners in a space built for 80, it's going to incur 

certain obligations. And we believe, as I said in 

answer to Justice Breyer's question, the State could 

choose to use less restrictive punishments, alternative 

punishments, get a better bang for their buck, have more 

public safety.

 But that's -- if we -- if the court imposed 

that kind of a rule, then the State would be here saying 

it's -- it's violating comity provisions and making 

policy choices for the State which it shouldn't. I 

believe in this case, the court gave the State the 

maximum degree of flexibility to make all the policy

choices surrounding -- surrounding the incarceration of 

these prisoners. You just -- the Constitution prevents 

the State from incarcerating somebody and then not 

providing them the basic medical care they need to 

escape from the prison and not die before their sentence 

is out. And that's what we have here.

 Thank you.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you take the State's 

concession that it can meet a goal in 5 years and the 

Federal court order is 2 years, we're talking about 3 

years. Is there any indication of how fast the State's 

remedy would click in? Are we talking maybe about a 

5 percent differential for the last 3 years, or -­

MR. SPECTER: Well, there are a lot of 

things the State can do quickly. For instance, it can 

reform its parole system; it cannot re-incarcerate 

technical parole violators. It can -­

legislature that he reduce the prison population; he 

said it could be done safely by the same amount, roughly 

37,000 prisoners, in 2 years. So what the court found 

was basically what the governor had believed was safe.

 The 5-year -- the 5-year period is longer, 

and the 5-year period is longer because it takes time to 

construct the facilities that the -- that the State 

wants to construct. I believe that's the major 

difference between the two remedies. But the other 

methods -- the good time credits, parole reform, 

diversion -- those can be implemented very quickly, and 

those substantial reductions can be accomplished safely 

in that amount of time.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So should the court have 

said 2 years for everything but construction? Wouldn't 

that have been a more narrowly tailored remedy?

 MR. SPECTER: Well, the State -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that they -­

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 Just a few points. First of all, with 

respect to the state of the record and what was 

proffered and what was not proffered, if you look at the 

joint appendix at 2085, there's a specific proffer that 

is made by the intervenors in that context -- or I 

mean -- I'm sorry. There's a specific proffer made by 

the State of the -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. What page 

was that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: 2085. That's volume 6 of the 

-- and it is at that point where the plaintiffs, the 

intervening plaintiffs say we'd like to put on evidence 

of constitutional violations. And Judge Karlton says: 

Twice this court has said we will not receive that 

evidence. You've made a clear -- as clear a record as 

you can; please don't waste our time.

 And then later, at 2338, which is again in

volume 6, where we enter Mr. Dezember, who is the 

assistant secretary of CDCR in charge of health care, he 

specifically said -- I've read the -- I've read the 

Dezember declaration, and it will not be received to the 

extent that it says the State is in compliance.

 So we've made our efforts -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry -­

MR. PHILLIPS: -- and we were rebuffed.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know what the 

declaration said. Is the actual declaration in the 

record somewhere?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I believe the actual 

declaration is in the record, Justice Sotomayor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Phillips, sorry, but on 

a -- on a different subject. Does the State stand by 

its representation that it can do this without any 

public safety impact in 5 years?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I mean, we made that 

submission to the court, and we -- we believe that we 

could comply with it. That said -­

 MR. PHILLIPS: Look, I mean, the plaintiffs' 

counsel talks about all of the things that you can do, 

and if you -- if you look at 70a of the -- the 

jurisdictional statement appendix, it specifically says 

there's a line; above the line we can implement, and 

that will get you about 16,000 inmates, and below the 

line you need legislation in order to implement these 

things. But the reality is that anytime you say you're 

going to release 30,000 inmates in a very compressed 

period of time, I guarantee you that there's going to be 

more crime and people are going to die on the streets of 

California. I mean that -- there's no way out of that 

particular box.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But if there were 5 years, 

you think you could do it without any public safety 

impact in the way that you told the court you could?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I think so, but I'm still 

concerned, because the district court in this specific 

says -- said: We have not evaluated the -- the safety 

impact of each of the State's -- of the elements of the 

State's proposed plan.

 And it seems to me they had an obligation to 

do that.

The other point I want to make with respect 

to Justice Kennedy's question is that there is not a 

shred of evidence that 137.5 makes any sense whatsoever. 

That is a pulled-out-of-the-air number. Theirs was 

aspirational. None of that is based on what is the 

constitutional violation that exists at the time you 

adopt that particular percentage.

 And it seems to me that's the entire problem 

with this -- this exercise, which is to say we're going 

to fix this across the board, rather than what would 

make much more sense, which is to evaluate these matters 

facility by facility, to evaluate these matters on the 

basis of the various elements discrete elements of how 

you can reduce the prison population, and to do it in -­

in conjunction with a receiver who is in place who can 

help to implement this in a very systemic way and that 

will get us to where we want to get to.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why didn't you give 

the court that as your plan? The court gave you 

absolute discretion to implement the plan that you 

wanted; it said we don't want to do facility by 

facility, because we want you to figure out where you 

need to implement.

 So, your plan didn't do that; why? Either 

in your 5-year plan or in your 2-year plan.

in 2 years, period. That's the categorical rule. And 

the first time we went in to suggest something above 

137.5, Judge Henderson said: I'm not hearing that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
