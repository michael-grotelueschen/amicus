 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 07-591, Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts.

 Mr. Fisher.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In Crawford v. Washington, this Court made 

clear that the right to confrontation, at its core, is a 

protection against a system of trial by affidavit. It 

is an ancient procedural guarantee that requires the 

prosecution to prove its case through live witnesses who 

testify before the jury and who are subject to 

cross-examination.

 Introducing forensic laboratory reports, 

such as the certificates at issue in this case, is the 

modern equivalent of trial by affidavit. The documents 

are sworn formal statements. They are crafted 

purposefully for the express purpose of proving a fact 

that is an element of a criminal offense, and, as the 

State forthrightly admits in its brief, they are 

introduced in lieu of having the analyst called as a 

witness to the stand. They are therefore

quintessentially testimonial evidence.

 Massachusetts --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say -- you say 

"the analyst." I suppose it doesn't have to be the 

analyst but whoever they decide to call. So if you had 

a supervisor who runs the cocaine testing lab and he is 

the one whose report is submitted, I take it he is the 

one who would have to show up.

 MR. FISHER: That's right. Our position --

our position is that whoever the Commonwealth wants to 

use to prove the fact that they are trying to prove is 

the person that needs to take the stand. In this case, 

it would be the analyst.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you would ask --

if a supervisor did it, what would you ask the 

supervisor? You'd say, you know, did you -- did you do 

this? Can you testify to your own knowledge that this 

is what the analysis showed? And he would have to say, 

no, it was one of my subordinates who did it, but I can 

tell you he was a very reliable person. How would that 

-- I don't understand how that would work.

 MR. FISHER: I took the Chief Justice's 

hypothetical to be that the supervisor had actually done 

the testing, but if the supervisor had not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. No. No,

I'm saying that he would testify, I guess: I run the 

lab, these are the people I hire, they know you how to 

do these tests, and this guy did the test. And since he 

was the one that the Government decided to -- on whose 

affidavit they decided to rely, that's the only person 

you could get.

 Now, you could -- to impeach him, you say, 

well, did you do the test? No. But you say, well --

but I mean you don't have a right to an analyst at a 

particular level.

 MR. FISHER: That's right. There is no 

substantive right. I think everything you've said is 

right as far as it goes. It just depends what the 

Commonwealth wants to put in in terms of evidence.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose --

MR. FISHER: If they want to put in --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the tests were by 

John Smith, assistant lab technician, and you call John 

Smith, and you say, "Is this your signature?" "Yes." 

"Do you remember doing this test?" And he says, "I do 

thousands of tests. I don't remember. I'll tell you 

the way I always do them." I mean, is that what you 

want?

 MR. FISHER: Well, if that's what -- at a 

minimum, that's what we want, Justice Kennedy. This

Court has made clear in California --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's what you're 

usually going to get, isn't it?

 MR. FISHER: Well, we don't know what we are 

going to get. In some cases, unquestionably --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you know what you're 

going to get by looking, number one, at the States which 

allow this, where this happens all the time. You know 

what you're going to get in the States where the 

defendant -- where the defense can subpoena the witness.

 Now, if there are new tests, complex DNA 

tests and so forth, I suppose there is a lot to ask 

about. Standard blood alcohol, not much to ask about.

 MR. FISHER: But even in a test where the 

analyst doesn't remember and, as you put it, it's a 

standardized test, there are still plenty of questions 

the defendant might want to ask, such as what test was 

performed? We don't even know from the record what test 

was performed in this case. What's the error rate on 

that test? How do your protocols work? What are your 

experience and credentials in analyzing those? There's 

plenty of questions the defendant might ask.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You can raise all those 

questions from the fact of the -- from the document. 

Tell the jury, "This doesn't show what tests were

performed." It's there on the document.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think that's a choice 

that defense counsel could make, as the defense counsel 

always has a choice in a criminal case to decide whether 

to press the prosecution's evidence or to simply stay 

silent and then later argue at closing the prosecution 

hasn't given you enough to prove the case.

 But to the extent the Commonwealth is taking 

the position that cross-examining would be fruitless in 

a situation like this, the very basis of this Court's 

Crawford decision is that's not for courts to decide. 

It is up to the defense counsel to -- if he wishes, to 

insist on live testimony that he can cross-examine and 

then --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then why -- why 

isn't it an adequate substitute to say that, if the 

defendant wants this testimony, the defendant can call 

the analyst and cross-examine the analyst as an adverse 

witness?

 MR. FISHER: Well, three reasons, Justice 

Ginsburg: First, if that were correct, then I don't see 

anything that would stop the prosecution in every 

criminal case simply from putting a pile of affidavits 

on a judge's desk and saying it's up to the defense to 

call whatever witnesses he wants and cross-examine them.

But even as a matter of text and structure 

of the Constitution, as a textual matter, the right to 

confrontation is a passive right in the defendant's 

hands. It requires the prosecution to arrange for the 

confrontation, and that's bolstered structurally by the 

Compulsory Process Clause. Remember, the Compulsory 

Process Clause gives the defendant the very right that 

you just explained, that the defendant can subpoena 

witnesses into court and ask them questions. And surely 

the Confrontation Clause adds something on top of that.

 And I think this Court's decision in Taylor 

against Illinois is the best explanation of the 

difference between the two clauses. This Court said 

that the Confrontation Clause arises simply by the 

nature of adversary proceedings, and it's a -- it's a 

rule that governs the way the prosecution must introduce 

its case. As I said at the opening here, it's a 

requirement that the prosecution put its live witnesses 

on the stand for the jury to observe them. The defense, 

of course, has the decision whether to cross-examine 

those witnesses, or if witnesses are not called by the 

prosecution that he would wish to be part of the case, 

he can subpoena them. But we would vigorously oppose 

any attempt to shift the burden on the defense to call 

witnesses like this.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you would say that 

what they call the notice-and-demand type statute, that 

that's all right?

 MR. FISHER: There is a variety of 

notice-and-demand type statutes, Justice Ginsburg, and I 

think the law professors' brief lays it out the best of 

what we have before you. We agree with the Solicitor 

General that a plain notice-and-demand statute that 

requires the defense to do nothing more than assert his 

right in advance of trial to have the prosecution put a 

live witness on the stand would be constitutional, I 

think, under this Court's jurisprudence. Under the 

Compulsory Process Clause, under the jury right, there 

are plenty of constitutional rights that, with fair 

notice, a Defendant can be required to assert in advance 

of trial.

 Now, there are other types of statutes that 

other States call "notice and demand" that require 

something more of the defendant, whether it be that the 

defendant himself call the witness, whether it be the 

defendant himself make some kind of good faith or prima 

facie showing in order to have the prosecution call the 

witness. Those types of statutes, I think this Court, 

to the extent in this opinion it would mention 

notice-and-demand statutes, it would want to be careful

to leave for another day, because, again, we would agree 

with the Solicitor General that those would raise more 

difficult constitutional questions.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In your answer, you said, 

well, there would be this stack of affidavits and that's 

all the State would have to do. I think, Mr. Fisher, 

that was not quite responsive because the question here 

is whether or not there is an exception for business 

records. Nobody is talking about affidavits, witnesses, 

and so forth. We are talking about business records 

done in the ordinary course.

 It's true that it -- that the core principle 

is whether that confrontation is required, but the 

question is whether or not business records should be 

treated as something that are not testimony because they 

are done based on other protocols with other procedures 

where there is substantial insulation from the facts of 

the particular case because it's a routine scientific 

exercise.

 So I think your answer, I would agree, is 

responsive based on your theory of the case, but as a 

matter of practice and as a matter of the issue that's 

before the Court, I don't think it addresses it.

 MR. FISHER: Okay. Thank you.

 I -- I took Justice Ginsburg's question to

be asking whether giving the defendant the right to 

subpoena the witness would be adequate under the 

Confrontation Clause if these documents were 

testimonial.

 Now, your question is whether they might not 

be testimonial at all viewed through the lens of whether 

they are a business record.

 So, as a historical matter, I think it's 

plain that no documents prepared in contemplation of 

litigation were ever considered to be business records. 

And this Court's decision in Palmer v. Hoffman in 1943 I 

think lays that out very, very clearly.

 So there is no historical argument that 

business records would fit -- would be exempted from the 

testimonial rule as a class. And, of course, this Court 

said in Crawford v. Washington that even if a State 

under a modern hearsay exception, whether it be a 

business-record rule or in the State of Massachusetts's 

case a special, brand-new hearsay rule -- just because 

that might be okay in the run-of-the-mill cases doesn't 

exempt it from the right to confrontation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the railroad 

case was an accident report. This is a scientific 

analysis.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think that is best

characterized, with all due respect, as an argument for 

its reliability. And it may well be that judges and 

juries think that certain scientific processes yield 

more reliable results in terms of reports and testimony 

and assertions. But we think, again -- and this Court's 

decision in Crawford says quite strongly -- that a judge 

cannot decide just on the basis of reliability to exempt 

a given record or a class of records from the 

Confrontation Clause.

 And I think, Justice Kennedy, another 

analogy that makes it even more clear is police reports. 

Police reports, just like the lab report in this case, 

are -- are sworn documents created by public servants 

who are sworn to tell the truth, sworn to find evidence 

whether it exonerates, whether it incriminates, and to 

write up a report. And I don't think anyone has ever 

suggested that police reports describing a crime scene 

-- for example, no matter how objective the facts 

relayed, such as there is a blood stain on the carpet, 

there is -- the door was wide open when I got there --

those kinds of assertions would be exempted from the 

Confrontation Clause.

 It may well be that they are likely to be 

correct, that they are assertions of fact that can be 

verified, but we've never understood that to fall

outside of the ambit of the Confrontation Clause.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if you had what we can 

call an independent lab, that certainly-- you certainly 

can distinguish that from a police report. It's a 

line-drawing question, I'll admit, but I think it's 

easily distinguished.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think if you had -- in 

contrast to this case, if you had a laboratory that was 

a private lab being used by the police, that would raise 

the question whether police agents who are private 

individuals but -- but asked by the police to create 

something like this, would generate testimonial evidence 

just as well. And I think the answer would be yes.

 In fact, in Davis this Court already 

addressed the situation, although it reserved in the 

footnote, but it assumed that the 911 operator in that 

case, who was a private individual working for a private 

company hired by the -- by the police --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Fisher, how many States 

do things the way -- the way you would have them done? 

I mean, how many States don't have these -- these notice 

laws, but in fact bring in the analyst to -- to give the 

information?

 MR. FISHER: Well, let me give you a few 

categories, Justice Scalia.

There are six States, it is our 

understanding, including big populous States like 

California, Illinois and Georgia, that have no special 

hearsay law whatsoever, that bring in witnesses if 

defendants demand it.

 There is another category of States --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they bring in 

witnesses if -- if defendants demand, but --

MR. FISHER: I'm sorry, I misspoke. I 

misspoke. That in the ordinary course need to bring in 

witnesses. Now, that was --getting ahead to my next --

my next category, there are at least nine or ten other 

States that have the kind of bland notice-and-demand 

regime that I was discussing with Justice Ginsburg. And 

so that's another category.

 And then you have -- since Crawford there is 

another, I believe, five additional States where their 

State supreme courts have held that Crawford applies to 

lab reports like this. So at least for the past couple 

of years they have been doing it the way that we would 

urge.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I wonder -- and correct me 

if I'm wrong -- if you -- if you didn't state your case 

strongly enough with reference to California. I thought 

California followed the rule that you advocate here.

MR. FISHER: That's what I meant to say if I 

didn't say it that way. Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything else? I 

-- I think you're quite right that -- that, look, I 

can't find anything in the history that suggest lab 

reports would be admitted because they would be 

considered being prepared for trial. But business 

records are kept out.

 So we have here a source that's unlikely to 

be particularly biased, the University of Massachusetts 

labs. And we have the checks of the discipline, the 

scientific discipline. On the other hand, it's being 

prepared for this trial.

 So it seems to me some things go one way; 

some things go the other way. I don't know exactly what 

the predominant things are. That's what I'd like you to 

address as much as possible.

 And when I look at the definition of 

"business records hearsay exception" today, it seems to 

me that the "hearsay exception" does cover today some of 

the things under "business records" that would be 

prepared particularly for trial. You could have a 

company that goes and measures lines on the street, or 

tread marks, or a variety of things. And I guess they 

come in under the "business records exception." Do

they? I mean, is that right?

 MR. FISHER: They might, Justice Breyer, and 

I'd -- I'd be willing to assume for purposes of argument 

that they would. But to the extent that they would be 

offered by the prosecution in a criminal case, the fact 

that they were a business record would not answer the 

confrontation question as to whether --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, of course, it 

wouldn't.

 MR. FISHER: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And that's why -- and maybe 

you have nothing else you want to say on this point. 

It's the same as Justice Kennedy raised.

 MR. FISHER: I think I do, Justice --

JUSTICE BREYER: It seems like there are 

some things going one way, and some things going the 

other on the issue of whether to call it "testimonial."

 MR. FISHER: But I do want to -- with all 

respect, I did want to add something to what you said 

about the rigors of the lab or of science. It may well 

be that those add to the truth, the reliability of 

reports. Let me say two things about that.

 First of all, the Confrontation Clause 

doesn't exempt bishops and nuns, or -- or anyone who we 

know or who we would think just as well would obviously

be telling the truth. It's, again, for the defendant to 

decide and not for the court to decide whether 

cross-examination would be useful.

 But let me add to that, Justice Breyer, that 

the Innocence Project brief in this case and plenty of 

other sources widely available I think very, very, very 

persuasively explain that lab reports are not quite as 

reliable as we might want to think they are, and not --

JUSTICE BREYER: There have been bad 

instances. You are absolutely right.

 MR. FISHER: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But what -- what I'm trying 

to work out in my mind is not necessarily what happened 

in the year 1084. I'd -- I'd be quite interested in 

your views on what's a workable rule. And when I look 

across the country on this, it seems most States have 

worked with a rule that has allowed the defendant to 

call the witness if he wants. There is not a particular 

unfairness to that. If he can get ahold of the witness, 

no problem. But they said: We are not going to make 

the State do this because it's a waste of time, for the 

most part. It just delays the trial, and there is 

really nothing at issue.

 MR. FISHER: Well, to the extent that is the 

prominent practice, it's one that grew up under this

Court's Roberts jurisprudence.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's true.

 MR. FISHER: I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: But if I assume -- I'm 

really uncertain as to whether it has covered 

"testimonial" or not. And also, I'm not enamored 

particularly of seeing on a close question what happened 

in ancient history.

 MR. FISHER: I understand.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, is there 

anything else you want to add to me on those 

assumptions?

 MR. FISHER: Yes, that -- that, again, it is 

-- it is not for the court; it's for the defendant to 

decide. We think the definition of "testimonial" 

generally speaking ought to be that when a document is 

prepared in contemplation of prosecution, or more 

specifically in this case to prove a fact that is an 

element of a criminal case, because that's what these 

reports say, then they should fall under the 

Confrontation Clause.

 And to the extent that these are in some 

realms and in some places reliable pieces of evidence, 

there is every reason to believe it's not going to cause 

any problem, because defendants aren't going to want to

challenge them very often. If you look at the 

statistics in the law professors' brief, they say in 

States like California that -- first of all, we have a 

huge category of cases that go away in plea bargains. 

And then even within the category of cases that go to 

trial, it's 10 percent of the time or less --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, a good defense 

lawyer would love to have the guy there. The first 

thing you say is: Do you remember testing Mr. Diaz's 

sample? The guy is going to say no. Just as was 

pointed out, I, you know, test thousands of samples. 

Well, how long have you been working with the lab? You 

know, just what -- what was your scientific background? 

When did you -- how does this test work? You put three 

drops of the acid in there. It turns color, whatever it 

does. How do you know that? What is the chemical? I 

mean, you spend three hours with the guy until the jury 

just doesn't think there is anything to the case at all.

 MR. FISHER: Well, the best I can do to 

answer that, Mr. Chief Justice, is to say that 

empirically apparently that just doesn't happen. And I 

think the reason why is explained in some of the defense 

manuals that we have cited in our brief, which say that 

if your theory of the case has nothing to do with 

whether the scientific report being introduced by the

prosecution is correct or not, very often the defense 

isn't going to do itself any favors by -- by insisting 

that that person take the stand, recite his credentials, 

recite the testing, and recite the damning evidence.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What does that fact support 

-- why does that fact support your argument, that in all 

of those cases you're arguing for what's going to be an 

empty exercise?

 MR. FISHER: No, I would very much resist 

that it will always be an empty exercise.

 JUSTICE ALITO: No. But in -- in the 

instance where the defendant doesn't think it would be 

worthwhile to subpoena the -- the recordkeeper, the 

person who performed the test, but simply wants to put 

the prosecution through the effort of getting the person 

there to testify, it's -- what is achieved?

 MR. FISHER: Well, as I said, I think that 

through notice-and-demand regimes and stipulations, 

often that is not going to happen. But if it is 

achieved, what is achieved is the same thing that is 

achieved in any criminal trial where a defendant insists 

periodically that the prosecution be put to its proof.

 After all, we are talking about putting 

somebody away for many years in a typical --

point. So that - all right, go back to the plea 

bargaining, which is your first thing, which makes me a 

little nervous for the reason that I see this bargaining 

system as a system where the prosecutor makes a charge, 

the prosecutor controls the sentence, then the defense 

bar would like to have an added weapon, and this added 

weapon is if you actually go to trial, I'm going to 

insist that you call these people. You don't even know 

where they are. I'm not going to accept the lab report. 

And then maybe the prosecutor will lower the requirement 

or maybe the prosecutor raised it in the first place 

because he thought you would say something like that.

 So I'm not -- is there anything you can say 

about how this works in the presence of plea bargaining? 

Do we know any -- do we have any information on that?

 MR. FISHER: I don't know of any empirical 

study where you might say what the price of this is. Of 

course, it happens already every day with other 

witnesses. You're going to have to bring in other 

witnesses, and this is one more witness. But again, 

even in a case where that's all that's going on, it's no 

different than all the other legal rights the defendant 

has.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure it's one more 

witness. Labs are backed up with DNA. You know, the

Federal budget for the courts, for the Federal courts, 

is $6 billion. Well, $1 billion of that is spent under 

the Criminal Justice Act for experts and translators and 

counsels. This -- this is a very, very substantial 

burden if we tell every State in the country that 

every -- in every drug case you are -- the State must 

produce the expert.

 MR. FISHER: Remember, Justice Kennedy, 

that -- that if you look at the States where this 

exists, that's not what happens and that's not what we 

are insisting on. All we are insisting is that the 

prosecution in a case where the defendant demands it, 

whether it be through a notice and demand regime or 

whether it be because the prosecution simply calls the 

defense on the phone two weeks before trial and says, 

I'd like to do this through documentary evidence -- and 

then these repeat players remember who -- who -- one 

thing I think it's worth keeping in mind in all this, is 

that in the criminal justice system, by and large, 

especially in drug cases like this, we are talking about 

repeat players.

the defendants or the lawyers?

 MR. FISHER: -- by and large, Your Honor. 

They have every -- they have incentives not to, as you 

might say, yank the chain of the other side.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Fisher, I am interested 

in the history since that's what the Court held in 

Crawford, that the content of the Confrontation Clause 

is not what we would like it to be, but what it 

historically was when it was enshrined in the 

Constitution. As a matter of history, was there a 

business records exception, not from the hearsay rule 

but from the Confrontation Clause?

 MR. FISHER: Not that I'm aware of. The 

best -- the best source that I believe exists is the 

Wigmore treatise, which both sides have cited. It says 

there was a shop-book rule that allowed shop-book 

ledgers and entries at the common law. But there is 

no -- there's no suggestion that that was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't that a business 

records exception? I don't --

MR. FISHER: It is a business records 

exception, but it's not an exception to the right to 

confrontation because no one would have considered 

ordinary business records created without contemplation 

of litigation to be -- to be testimonial evidence. What

we have here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, wait. You say it's --

that business records would often or usually not be 

testimonial?

 MR. FISHER: I think all of the business 

records that were admissible at the time of the founding 

would have been nontestimonial.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would have been 

nontestimonial. So they'd come in on that basis, not 

because they were business records?

 MR. FISHER: In a criminal case -- well, the 

typical regime -- and I'm going to assume that it exists 

at the time of founding, but you need some evidentiary 

rule to get a piece of evidence in in the first place, 

whether it be business records or whether it be just an 

ordinary rule of relevance. But, yes, they would have 

been admissible at the time of -- ordinary business 

record like a shop book would have been admissible at 

the time of the founding, but would have not raised a 

confrontation problem even in a criminal cause because 

it would have been nontestimonial.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Fisher, I just want to 

be about -- clear about one thing. We are talking about 

drug cases primarily. But the rule that we are fighting 

about is not limited to drugs. Doesn't it apply to

laboratory reports on DNA, blood tests, all sorts of 

evidence? Isn't that correct?

 MR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Stevens. 

And you can you look at the Massachusetts own decisions. 

The State courts in Massachusetts already extended their 

rule in their day to ballistics tests, for example, 

which are notoriously unreliable in terms of empirical 

studies that have been -- that have been conducted about 

them. And my understanding -- I think you're right --

is that nothing in the Commonwealth's rule distinguishes 

one kind of forensic report from another.

 The United States is offering a slightly 

different analysis that appears to ask, to some degree, 

the degree of interpretation involved in a given 

forensic laboratory report. I don't know how you would 

administer that rule, but I can say that to whatever 

extent interpretation would be required, this is clearly 

on the interpretive side of the ledger.

 And again, if I could point the Court to a 

source for that, the Scientific Evidence treatise by 

Giannelli and Imwinkelried that the both parties cite at 

section 23.030(c) lays out the mass spectrometry way of 

testing for drugs that the Commonwealth tells you was 

the test used in this case and describes in great detail 

the amount of expertise, care, skill and interpretive

methods that need to be brought in that kind of a test.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we know that 

this was prepared in contemplation of litigation? I 

mean, let's suppose the lab occasionally does analyses 

for other -- research purposes. They get a sample, they 

want to know what it's -- they want to test it, however 

they do it. Are we just assuming that it's prepared in 

contemplation of litigation because it usually is, or --

you can imagine a situation where the analyst really has 

no idea, other than perhaps supposition, why he is being 

asked to test the sample.

 MR. FISHER: The easiest answer in this 

case, Mr. Chief Justice, is it's required by 

Massachusetts law that -- that these tests be done in 

contemplation of prosecution. The law itself says that 

the police officer can give it to an analyst, and the 

analyst can certify a report if it's to be used for law 

enforcement purposes. So there is a statutory 

requirement. Now, you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the question 

is it could be law enforcement purposes to test it for 

the police to use and educational programs that want the 

rookies to know what the cocaine looks like.

 MR. FISHER: Well, to the degree it's not 

answer ed in this case by statute, undoubtedly this

Court as it works through this jurisprudence will need 

to ask a question of common sense, whether the actors 

involved -- as this Court did in Davis -- whether the 

actors involved would understand what they are doing is 

creating evidence for a criminal case?

 If there are no more questions --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- I'm sorry. Go 

ahead.

 MR. FISHER: Okay. I'll reserve my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I -- may I just ask, 

you would extend this to a -- a breath test, a blood 

test, fingerprints, urinalysis? All of those would be 

covered by your position?

 MR. FISHER: To the extent that the 

prosecution wanted to introduce a report certifying a 

reporting result of a test, yes, it would be covered by 

ours.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you answered the 

question that a supervisor wouldn't be an adequate 

substitute for the analyst. But suppose the lab says: 

We are very busy in this place; could we schedule a 

deposition; we'll present the analyst at a time mutually 

agreeable to both sides, rather than have the analyst on 

the hook to show up on a trial date?

MR. FISHER: That would work to preserve the 

evidence in case the analyst became unavailable at the 

time of trial. And then under this Court's 

jurisprudence that deposition would be admissible.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But only if the analyst 

wasn't there on the day of trial?

 MR. FISHER: Then you -- then I don't think 

it would substitute for live testimony.

 But let me say one other way that this 

problem can be addressed by States is that they could 

have a supervisor take the stand and rely on raw data --

on raw data and give his or her explanation of raw data. 

It's just that the person cannot take the stand and 

relay somebody else's conclusion to the jury.

 And if there are no more questions, I'll 

reserve.

Mr. Fisher. We'll give you your full rebuttal time.

covered by the Confrontation Clause. That is, they are 

not the statement of a percipient witness who has 

observed past behavior of the defendant.

 Indeed, what they are are official records 

of objective identified -- it's independently verifiable 

facts that are -- that were admissible at common law.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What is your answer to 

Mr. Fisher's argument that if that proposition of yours 

is -- is -- is, in fact, sound in response to this case, 

the State can put in its entire case by -- in a 

circumstantial evidence case, by way of affidavit and, 

in effect, satisfy the Confrontation Clause by saying, 

well, you can call the witness as part of the defense 

case and cross-examine there?

 MS. COAKLEY: Because clearly, the kinds of 

affidavits that are the subject of Confrontation Clause 

analysis could not be submitted by that. I think this 

is an exception to that. And so --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then that's what you 

have got to explain to me. Why is it an exception?

 MS. COAKLEY: Because first of all, although 

the Court has not addressed it so far with Mr. Fisher, 

these are really not testimonial statements. None of 

the cases that have dealt with Confrontation Clause 

analysis -- before Ohio, through Ohio, through in fact

Giles -- deal with the kind of statement that we are 

talking about here. It's really a report of a scientist 

test.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what about the -- the 

blue car going down the street statement? In a 

circumstantial evidence case the witness comes in and 

says yes, I saw a blue car go down the street at 10 

o'clock. Is that testimonial?

 MS. COAKLEY: It is, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And the distinction between 

that and the lab report saying the substance that was 

shown to me which I analyzed was cocaine, what's the --

what's the distinction?

 MS. COAKLEY: In the first instance you have 

a witness to an event in a particular case that can be 

tied to, perhaps, behavior of the defendant that's 

deemed to be criminal. It's -- it's classic hearsay and 

subject to confrontation, if it's, you know, is going to 

be used by the prosecution.

 In this instance, though, we have a protocol 

set up by a State statute that indeed does test 

substances other than those definitely headed for 

litigation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see the difference 

between the two. I mean, the one, he saw the blue car

going down the street, which through other evidence can 

be connected to the defendant; and here the witness says 

this is cocaine, which through other evidence is going 

to be connected to the defendant. And in both cases 

that -- that connected fact is deemed essential by the 

prosecution for the conviction. I don't see the 

difference between the two.

 MS. COAKLEY: Well, I think there are 

several differences, Your Honor, but one of which is 

that it is identifiable and it can be verified outside 

of what the scope of the Confrontation Clause is. In 

other words, the defendant has a chance to test it ahead 

of time, have his own independent witness. This doesn't 

change. Whether it is cocaine before, during or after 

the trial is testable.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why --

MS. COAKLEY: And it's not true of a witness 

statement.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why does that make a 

difference? In other words, the -- Justice Scalia said 

a moment ago, you know, the -- the statement about the 

blue car is -- is tied in in the hypothetical case by 

another witness who said yes, at -- at 10:01 when I 

heard the gun go off there was a blue car there. In 

this case the cocaine is tied in by saying, yes, the

cocaine which I delivered to X, about which he has 

testified, is cocaine that I took out of the pocket of 

the defendant.

 There is -- there is a temporal and physical 

path worked out in both cases. And it seems to me your 

attempt to distinguish them is to say well, the temporal 

path can be extended by one more step in the cocaine 

case because you can take the cocaine or take something 

from the cocaine sample and let the defense expert 

testify to it; which of course is true, but I don't see 

what that has got to do with the Confrontation Clause or 

the definition of testimonial evidence.

 MS. COAKLEY: I -- I think that that's 

significant, Your Honor, because it can be tested and 

verified and isn't dependent upon a cross examination at 

trial.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But aren't you really 

saying that the confrontation right is therefore not so 

important because you have a greater opportunity in the 

cocaine case of coming up with -- with rebutting 

evidence, if indeed rebutting evidence can be found.

 In other words, if -- if -- if the State's 

witness is wrong, you've got a better shot at proving 

him wrong than in the blue car case. But if that is 

your argument, I don't see what it's got to do with --

with the basic confrontation right.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think I go back, Your 

Honor, to looking at all the kinds of statements that 

this Court has looked at within the scope of the 

Confrontation Clause. This kind of public record, 

official record, laboratory report, has never been the 

subject of this kind of analysis and indeed it's not 

sufficient.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, have we ever had --

have we ever had a -- a kind of lab report, public 

record kind of case in -- in which the record was 

prepared expressly for trial?

 MS. COAKLEY: I think that if you look at 

Dutton, for instance, and the concurring opinion by 

Justice Harlan talking about laboratory reports deemed 

to be whatever the analysis was, a business record, that 

would have been --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but Justice Harlan did 

not take the majority view. I mean you -- I don't know 

where you get authority for the proposition that the 

public record prepared for the purpose of litigation 

would have come in under the, in effect, the founding 

era -- or would have been outside the founding era 

definition of testimonial.

instance of a coroner's result -- not the coroner's 

verdict that involves Marian-type depositions, but the 

results of a coroner's verdict that says somebody is 

dead and this is the cause and manner and means of 

death -- would have been admissible at the time with --

that kind of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: For the indictment, not --

not as -- not as independent evidence in the 

prosecution. It would form the basis for the 

indictment, as I understand what the history is. It 

would not be introduced and -- and -- and shown to the 

jury as evidence that -- that indeed the cause of death 

was thus and so.

 MR. FISHER: But autopsy results -- my 

understanding, Your Honor, is that autopsy results --

again not a coroner's verdict, which -- in the reply 

brief we believe that counsel has conflated what would 

be a verdict between the fact of an official record, an 

autopsy report of the death, manner and means of 

death -- have been and still admissible.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me -- and tell 

me if this is not the way you want to argue. It seems 

to me to make your case you have to say of course this 

is hearsay; and the question is whether it's 

testimonial.

MS. COAKLEY: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it's not testimonial 

because these are laboratory protocols, subject to 

ongoing, objective, repeated standards; that's different 

from testimony that it was a blue car, which is specific 

to the case. That's the kind of framework of the 

argument you have to make.

 MS. COAKLEY: That's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that as a result of 

that it is not testimonial because "testimonial" is a 

legal term that's subject to interpretation. I -- I 

guess that's the argument you're making and that you 

have to make.

 MS. COAKLEY: Well, that's correct, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: As I see it.

 MS. COAKLEY: And I think that that is 

certainly consistent with the way in which this Court in 

looking at the series of cases from Crawford since, have 

looked at what a testimonial statement is. Admittedly, 

you haven't addressed this kind of statement, and I 

would argue because it doesn't fall within the principal 

evil that the Confrontation Clause is designed to 

prevent.

testimonial because it wasn't really directed to trial. 

This does seem more directed to trial, so then you have 

to tell us why even if it is, there are some independent 

guarantees of -- of reliability that means that we 

should say it's not testimonial as a legal matter.

 MS. COAKLEY: Well, I agree, Your Honor. I 

think that you cannot pull one of these qualities out 

and say that because it's prepared in anticipation of 

trial means that therefore it is testimonial. There 

have been several criteria that this Court has looked 

at, including -- there are other kinds of analogies to 

this that are akin to this kind of record. For 

instance, in an assault case, a gun which is the real 

evidence -- remember the cocaine is the real evidence 

here -- the Commonwealth would introduce a certificate 

saying this is a working gun, and that is in lieu of the 

analyst coming in. When we have to prove public way, 

when we have to prove school zone, when we have to prove 

in some instances --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Ballistics as well? You

would extend this to ballistic tests?

 MS. COAKLEY: If --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you don't have to 

bring in the ballistic expert? You can just --

MS. COAKLEY: Not to prove it's a working 

firearm, Your Honor. In order to make a comparison -- I 

would agree with counsel that once you get into the 

discretionary areas that you need to make comparisons 

and analysis, but this is not that case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that 

difference.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm looking at 

footnote 10 in your brief on page 30. And you concede 

that some interpretation of the machine-generated data 

ordinarily is required. Now why isn't that a suggestion 

that there is some leeway and subjective interpretation, 

and you might have different analysts coming out 

differently and so you need to get the fellow there and 

ask him well, how often do you -- how often do one of 

your fellow analysts disagree with your conclusion?

 Or this is subjective; I guess some people 

read it one way or the other one way; which way do you 

always read it? That kind of stuff.

 MS. COAKLEY: Well, interestingly, Your 

Honor, that argument wasn't raised in this case below

and really hasn't been raised in this case before the 

Court. In fact this is one of the straightforward 

objective tests that says you put this material into the 

machine, and the Solicitor General also deals with this. 

The 100 percent accuracy by and large from that result 

says this is cocaine; this is heroin, this is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I didn't -- I 

didn't go back and read the scientific treatise you 

cite, but you say some interpretation is required. So 

what type of interpretation?

 MS. COAKLEY: The interpretation that 

because of the way that the machine works, the chemicals 

are separated out. And so a chemist, if properly 

trained, can say by the separation of the chemicals 

these three, or four or whatever the elements are, equal 

cocaine.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do you have to have 

a machine? I mean, what about -- what about ballistics? 

"This bullet came from that gun." Does that involve 

sufficient discretion, sufficient judgment that the 

expert has to be there, while the blood -- blood or drug 

testing doesn't?

 It seems to me that's where you have to draw 

the line.

 MS. COAKLEY: Well, I believe that that's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And to say that that 

wasn't raised in the case, this is precisely the 

question we are going to have to decide if you're going 

to prevail. I don't think it helps to say it wasn't 

raised in the case.

 MS. COAKLEY: Well, I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: We are raising it.

 MS. COAKLEY: I agree, Your Honor. But that 

has to do with how satisfied the Court is whether here 

or in other jurisdictions that is a reliable result, and 

I hesitate to use the word "reliable." I don't mean it 

in the Ohio v. Roberts sense. We are talking about the 

scientific test that is or is not reliable, and 

therefore does it require some other test, whether 

Confrontation Clause or not?

 JUSTICE BREYER: How can we administer 

something like that? His point I think is, look, you 

can't make any distinction either of something that is 

evidence was prepared with an eye towards trial or it 

wasn't. And if it was prepared with an eye towards 

trial, well, then call the person and have him testify. 

That's it. And if that encompasses every test under the 

sun, so be it, because there is no way to draw a 

reasonable line.

 You start talking about reliability and

their amicus brief is filled with horror stories of how 

police labs or other labs have really been way off base 

and moreover really wrong. And you say, oh, distinguish 

between a police lab and University of Massachusetts? 

Try going down that road of which one is reliable, which 

one isn't reliable. How do we know?

 MS. COAKLEY: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's his point. No 

workable way to do it. There can be horrors on both --

in both areas, and so follow what the history was where 

there was no history on this being admissible.

 MS. COAKLEY: Your Honor, I disagree because 

the issues around many of those wrongful convictions 

related to suggestive identification procedures, other 

kinds of issues. I'm not aware of any wrongful 

convictions that came about because --

JUSTICE BREYER: Aren't there some things I 

read in the paper all the time, about these laboratories 

in various places, and they lost the results, they got 

it all wrong? That just doesn't happen?

 MS. COAKLEY: I'm not saying that, Your 

Honor, but I'm saying there are certain evils that the 

Confrontation Clause is designed to prevent. Either 

abuse at the laboratory stage or misconduct by 

prosecutors prior to trial or analysts is not one that

the Confrontation Clause is either designed to or is 

specifically very good at getting at.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? I know I prefer 

one thing, the custody. It's very important to know 

whether indeed this was the particular substance that 

was taken from the defendant. And to establish that, 

you have to establish a line of custody. And you can't 

do that without getting in the person who did the test.

 MS. COAKLEY: Well, Your Honor, I agree the 

chain of custody is crucial and it relates to the 

careful procedure that a police officer used, who by the 

way is the confrontation witness that you worry about 

because the behavior is the buying, selling, possession 

of drugs. The element of whether it is cocaine or not 

really becomes almost secondary to the case. The issue 

is was the behavior criminal? So the officer who seized 

the drugs is available for confrontation. The drug is 

then clearly marked so the Commonwealth has to create 

that chain of custody for the court, and indeed if the 

defendant, who is in the best position to think that 

perhaps this is involving something other than cocaine 

or heroin, has all the opportunities that he needs to 

make sure that he gets a fair trial.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He says -- the policeman 

says, "And I gave it to the University of Massachusetts

 MS. COAKLEY: And they marked it in a 

particular way that identified --

JUSTICE SCALIA: "And I watched when they 

marked it in a particular way."

 MS. COAKLEY: And the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How do I know that that 

thing is the one that got to the desk of the analyst who 

wrote this report?

 MS. COAKLEY: I think that whether you 

brought the analyst in or not, you would have the same 

establishment of the chain of custody and, indeed, that 

piece of evidence as to whether it's the same drug 

relates to the officer in this case testified the 

packaging. He could identify it. It comes back --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you say you can require 

witnesses to show that, right up to the analyst who did 

the testing, you can require witnesses to testify? All 

the way up to there but not the analyst himself?

 MS. COAKLEY: I think, Your Honor, that the 

issue between chain of custody and whether the 

Confrontation Clause is implicated are different issues 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you say that, it 

seems to me, because you are -- and I think consistently

-- making a distinction between credibility issues and 

reliability issues. And I think you are implicitly 

saying the Confrontation Clause is there to test 

credibility but not reliability.

 MS. COAKLEY: I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The machine is reliable; 

therefore, it's outside of confrontation. And I don't 

understand the validity of this distinction that is 

implicit in your answers.

 MS. COAKLEY: I think perhaps if the Court 

looks at accuracy rather than reliability and gets 

outside the realm of the kinds of statements --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, accuracy --

MS. COAKLEY: -- that we looked at.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- is an aspect of it.

 MS. COAKLEY: But accuracy goes to what this 

Court has always allowed in referring to, for instance, 

a business records exception or a public records 

exception. The reason they are admissible is precisely 

because we believe them to be accurate, and more 

importantly in this case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. No. They are 

admissible in criminal cases as far as the Confrontation 

Clause is concerned because they are not testimonial.

 MS. COAKLEY: And they are related, however,

Your Honor, because the roots of whether it's hearsay or 

not and the Confrontation Clause arguments come from the 

same concern that somebody get a fair trial, that he or 

she has the right to confront the witness --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We are back to Roberts 

then.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I do wish you would 

comment on the argument that the State of California --

a huge state with many, many drug prosecutions -- seems 

to get along all right under the rule that the 

Petitioner proposes.

 MS. COAKLEY: I did join the amicus brief, 

Your Honor. I believe and -- though I think it's too 

early to tell because I, certainly from my own 

experience, know that the number of cases that go to 

trial is not an indication of what the work is that is 

involved, and I know that in Massachusetts it would --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the State of California 

and other populous States have for, I take it, some 

number of years been able to function quite effectively 

under the rule that the Petitioner proposes, it seems to 

me that's something that you have to address.

 MS. COAKLEY: And I address that, Your 

Honor, by saying that for Massachusetts it would be an 

undue burden with very little benefit to the defendant.

that in California it's a workable rule and it's caused 

no problems?

 MS. COAKLEY: I -- I can't disagree with 

that, Your Honor. I don't have enough information about 

the way California works or doesn't work. I know that 

as a practical matter --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it seems to me it's 

a very important point.

 MS. COAKLEY: Well, as a practical matter in 

Massachusetts, it would mean that district court 

misdemeanor drug prosecutions would essentially grind to 

a halt, and the value to the defendant -- and this Court 

has looked at in Inadi and in other situations where 

there does not seem to be the real issue involved with 

Confrontation Clause.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you're predicting 

that grind to a halt, but there are going to be a large 

number that wash out because they are plea bargained. 

So they won't get into the picture at all. There will 

probably be a goodly number in which defense counsel 

will stipulate that the drug quantity -- the drug type 

was such and such and quantity such and such. So you 

don't know in how many cases the defendant would take

advantage of this confrontation right?

 MS. COAKLEY: No, and they often will not 

stipulate, Your Honor, until the day of trial when they 

realize that the chemist is there. That's from my own 

experience and that's a commonsensical rule. The 

question is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't these people have to 

appear before the same judge again and again? The point 

made these are repeat attorneys, and I don't think you 

make friends and influence people among judges by 

insisting upon testimony in criminal cases where it is 

obviously not needed.

 MS. COAKLEY: Well, two points, Your Honor: 

In Massachusetts, we do have a circuit court and a 

superior court so judges move around. And the second 

thing is that -- my experience is that defendants, 

whether appointed or otherwise, are extremely vigorous 

in protecting their rights, and if I were defense 

counsel and I had a strategic advantage, I would insist 

on it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you see any reason --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think California 

did not join the amicus brief.

notice-and-demand statute wouldn't satisfy your concern?

 MS. COAKLEY: Well, the -- the Petitioner 

agreed that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: A bland notice-and-demand 

statute --

MS. COAKLEY: We would argue that 

Massachusetts' statute is the functional equivalent of a 

notice-and-demand statute and complies with whatever 

concerns the Court may have about the right to 

confrontation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it's the 

central issue in the case? The defense says, "That 

stuff I was carrying was not cocaine. Either I was 

trying -- you know, I was going to stiff the person I 

was selling it to or whatever." That's the sole 

defense. That's not cocaine. All you've got to do is 

submit an affidavit from the lab guy saying, "I tested 

it; it is"?

 MS. COAKLEY: Well, from the prosecution's 

point of view that would be a bad strategic decision. 

That's an instance where you would bring in the analyst 

because you want to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's a non- answer. We 

are asking what's the rule?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA H. SCHERTLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

 MS. SCHERTLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The Confrontation Clause is not implicated 

when a human being merely authenticates for trial the 

instruments-generated result of a scientific test. That 

is because the direct output of an instrument is not 

testimonial and human assertions that merely establish

the foundation for admitting nontestimonial evidence do 

not themselves trigger Confrontation Clause rights.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe if you were 

just -- if you were just putting in the machine, the raw 

information from the machine. But here what speaks is 

the certification by the analyst, so you don't have 

simply a machine-generated result; you have a human 

person who seems to be testifying: I certify that this 

is an accurate report.

 MS. SCHERTLER: If I could draw an analogy, 

Justice Ginsburg, to a historical example that we think 

illustrates our point, historically records custodians 

-- public records custodians have been permitted to 

certify through, when they have express authority at the 

common law, and -- and into present day that they did a 

records search, that they found a document within the 

public records of an agency, and that the document that 

they are attaching is a true copy of what they found.

 Those are statements by humans that really 

set forth the conditions for -- under which the evidence 

is being presented to the jury.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But --

MS. SCHERTLER: But those have always been 

accepted.

for trial. It's not material that was generated 

precisely in order to prosecute an individual.

 MS. SCHERTLER: The underlying material in 

the public records case is not testimonial because it 

was not prepared for trial.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.

 MS. SCHERTLER: In this case, Justice 

Scalia, we would submit that the underlying material is 

also not testimonial, albeit for a separate reason; and 

that is that it is an instrument-generated result and 

therefore not the statement of a witness.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's, let's assume that 

it's critical to a particular murder prosecution what 

time the shot was fired, okay? And you mean to tell me 

if -- if somebody says I heard the clock strike 12 at 

the time the shot was fired, that would not be 

testimony? Yes, the clock is a machine, right?

 MS. SCHERTLER: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He is just reciting what 

the clock said.

 MS. SCHERTLER: My analogy would be, Justice 

Scalia, if that clock had in itself a trigger mechanism 

that would detect when a gunshot was fired; and if that 

clock delivered, as you have in the cases of a drug 

analysis, a result, a reading that one could submit into

court that says shot detected at 12 p.m., that that 

nontestimonial evidence could be submitted consistently 

with Confrontation Clause principles, but it would still 

require authentication.

 Some person may have to establish that this 

clock was set up, it was operating properly, it was 

calibrated the way it had to. Those all go to the same 

sorts of foundational facts that are akin to the public 

records certificate.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you make me think the 

public certificate. Let's imagine birth and death 

records. There is a whole building full of them; they 

are on microfiche. Now, I am not sure how Massachusetts 

works, but I suppose if you want to introduce one you 

call up the -- the keeper and the keeper looks it up, 

produces it, and has a separate piece of paper or maybe 

written beneath it which says: "This is a true copy of 

the," and you don't call in the keeper.

 Now that statement on a piece of paper, 

"this is a true copy of the birth certificate of John 

Smith," that was prepared specifically for this trial.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Yes, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So I take it that has 

nothing -- I mean we'll find out, but if they win, every 

one of those cases, every document you have to bring in

the person to make clear that the document that says 

that this is a copy of the document --

MS. SCHERTLER: Our --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that what -- is that the 

point?

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, that is -- that is our 

point. That it is too -- it is too simplified to say, 

as Petitioner does here, that if it's an affidavit or a 

certificate, and it's prepared for trial, that's the end 

of the analysis.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you have to have some 

boundaries, you have to have some framework, you have to 

have some explanation. You started talking about a 

machine. There is no machine in Justice Breyer's 

hypothetical, so it seems to me you have two different 

rationales floating around here and -- and neither are 

tethered to a specific rule.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, Justice Kennedy, this 

is why I would bring those two rules together. In the 

public records example, what you have is underlying 

evidence going into the jury that is nontestimonial. In 

that instance, it was because it was a public record not 

prepared for trial but has always been accepted from --

has always been viewed as nontestimonial.

 Your Honor is correct. In this case we

don't have that, but what we do have is an underlying 

evidentiary item that is nontestimonial for a separate 

purpose, and that is that it is a machine-generated 

result.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: You're going to work 

either. Because the person -- Sir Walter Raleigh's 

accusers wanted to testify about something that was 

nontestimonial: what happened on the day. So what we 

are looking for -- I mean, I agree with you that it is a 

very peculiar result that's going to have every public 

document in the United States suddenly have the keeper 

of that document having to come into court.

 On the other hand, I'm having a hard time 

figuring out what the distinction is between that and 

all these other things.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well -- yes, Justice Breyer. 

Let me just add that in the public records custodian 

situation, there is always the possibility that the 

public records custodian who is signing that certificate 

was careless, is a liar; and those certificates yet have 

always been viewed as simply foundational vehicles for 

getting to the jury nontestimonial evidence. The 

defense is not --

clarify one thing for me. Is the rule you're seeking 

one limited to tests performed by machines?

 MS. SCHERTLER: The rule that I have 

articulated so far, yes. It is -- it would be --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So would you agree the 

Confrontation Clause would apply if it were an 

independent expert's test -- test results and testimony.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Justice Stevens, we also 

have an alternative argument --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Just tell me yes or no.

 MS. SCHERTLER: No. I would not. Because 

we have an alternative --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, then we shouldn't 

talk about just machines.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, we hope to rely on one 

of the same arguments that Massachusetts does, which is 

that there was a broad exception at common law for 

official records, those created by public officers doing 

their duty.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me you have to 

do that because there is all sorts of machines that have 

to be interpreted. There -- a chromatic spectrum 

analysis; the person has to say what he saw there, what 

she saw there.

 MS. SCHERTLER: I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So just because the 

machine is involved it seems to me we cannot make a 

sensible rule based on that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And there was not a broad 

exception at common law for public records created in 

anticipation of criminal litigation.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, we have -- I mean, we 

have looked for that limitation in the authorities and 

we simply have not found it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Have you found cases where 

the material was admitted as a public record despite the 

fact that it was a public record created for 

prosecution?

 MR. FISHER: The difficulty with that, 

Justice Scalia, is I don't know of equivalent or 

comparable records that were being created at that time 

for purposes of litigation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: These other records, no, 

you haven't found them.

 MS. SCHERTLER: No. I have -- I have not.

 Yet, if I could go back to Justice Kennedy's 

question, there is no record here about how this test in 

particular was done, but there -- there -- I can tell 

the Court that actually technology in the controlled

substance area is to the point where an instrument does 

in fact provide an answer to the analyst. It provides a 

mass spectrum of the unknown and a --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes but the rule, the 

issue is not limited to drug cases. Murder cases, all 

sorts of cases where there is scientific evidence.

 MS. SCHERTLER: Well, the -- the narrower 

rule that we are discussing here would be limited to 

those situations in which the underlying evidence to be 

presented to the jury is nontestimonial because it is 

instrument-generated and did not require human analysis.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is your -- what 

is your answer to the question I posed to the Attorney 

General? The only issue in the case is whether the 

powder is or is not cocaine. You think you get by if 

the law says you can admit this with an affidavit?

 MS. SCHERTLER: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice for 

the following reason. Just as in the case of the 

records custodians, a defendant may believe that that is 

not an authentic record; and nothing about the rule we 

propose would prevent the defense from challenging the 

authenticity or the circumstances, the correctness of 

the testing procedures that were used.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you can't --

whether -- whether the Confrontation Clause requires 

that that challenge occur in the Government's case on 

cross-examination, or as in these record custodian's 

cases, if the defense wants to challenge the 

authenticity of the underlying nontestimonial evidence, 

he must do so in his case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you comment on the 

California experience, please?

 MS. SCHERTLER: I would -- I would be happy 

to, Justice Kennedy.

 I -- I don't have information about 

California. I do have information about the District of 

Columbia. And I can tell the court that in the time 

period since the District of Columbia Court of Appeals 

held that these sorts of certificates of analysis were 

testimonial, that the court appearances that have been 

required of DEA chemists at the Mid-Atlantic laboratory 

have increased by 500 percent, from seven to 10 

appearances per month to routinely over 50 per month, 

and that the corresponding time that it takes to analyze 

substance has increased.

 Thank you, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FISHER: Let me start, Your Honors: If 

there is any doubt remaining about the machine-generated 

theory that the Solicitor General was putting forward 

today, again I would refer the court back to the 

scientific evidence treatise.

 The raw data of a mass spectrometer looks --

looks something like a heart monitor. It's a printout 

of the squiggly line across the page that a person needs 

to look at and then analyze as to what it shows about 

the molecular composite of the substance that the 

machine was operating. We have no objection if 

prosecutors in criminal cases want to introduce machine 

generated data. They can do that.

 But what they can't do is introduce --

introduce affidavits certifying as to their -- you know, 

their interpretation of what a machine did or simply 

what a machine says, because there is no difference --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you say they could 

introduce the squiggly line and put on the stand an 

analyst who says what that squiggly line shows is that 

this was cocaine?

 MR. FISHER: They could do that, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your distinction

with the recordkeeper?

 MR. FISHER: Pardon me?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your distinction 

from your own theory of the recordkeeper? Does the 

recordkeeper all have to -- do they all have to testify 

to testify that this is indeed the record?

 MR. FISHER: My understanding of the common 

law on that, as the solicitor general put it, is that 

that was a foundational requirement that was not 

necessarily considered evidence.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, there's a 

hearsay -- there is a hearsay aspect. I'm not saying 

it's the only thing. There is a chain and so forth but, 

there is a hearsay aspect to that which you see, okay. 

The certificate says this is Joe Jones' birth 

certificate. That's what the -- now, that's that person 

outside of court who made that little piece of paper for 

purposes of this case. And moreover, the statement that 

it certifies to is directly relevant; indeed, the whole 

thing falls without it.

 So, are you going to say the same thing 

applies, your rule, and you have to call the 

recordkeeper in or not? And I think you're going to say 

not. And if you're going to say not, I want to know 

what the distinction is?

MR. FISHER: As a general matter, yes, our 

rule is consistent. Now, if you look at Wigmore, 

Wigmore --

JUSTICE BREYER: You are going to calling 

in -- you're going to --

MR. FISHER: I'm trying to answer. What 

Wigmore says is that something like a public 

recordkeeper's seal was not considered evidence, per se. 

It was a foundational requirement to put evidence in. 

And so, in this Court's words in the Dowdell case, it's 

something like a court reporter's transcript that goes 

up to a Court of Appeals and then is looked at. It's 

not considered evidence against a criminal defendant.

 Now, in stark contrast to this case where 

the document is expressly citing to a statute of 

Massachusetts law and saying this element of the 

criminal charge is satisfied. It is a very big 

difference.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The graph, spectrograph 

or -- or -- or the -- the chart is introduced. Chain of 

custody is either stipulated or established. Can a 

person who did not make the test testify as to what that 

line -- what that graph means, and would that be 

sufficient to convict?

 MR. FISHER: So long as chain of custody was

satisfied, yes, Justice Kennedy, that someone could take 

the stand and do that. But remember, the reports in 

this case do not just report -- even if you accepted the 

solicitor's general's version that they are reporting 

what the machine said about the substance, they also 

have a paragraph before that, and this goes to Justice 

Scalia's question, say, these are -- these are the 

substances that were taken from the defendant in this 

case and given to me by this officer, and so, that is 

additional information that is being sworn to in the 

affidavit in this case that is also testimony.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why don't you insist, even 

in that case, on the confrontation right to examine the 

person who actually conducted the test itself and 

generated the papers that the later expert testifies on 

in order to determine the admissibility of the -- of 

the -- the test results themselves?

 MR. FISHER: I think the defendant may have 

that right. I understood Justice Kennedy's hypothetical 

to suggest that that chain of custody was stipulated to 

or otherwise agreed.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. All I wanted to know 

was whether you were giving that away or not.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but chain of custody 

is -- is quite different from the quantitative analysis

and the professional opinion. My question is only chain 

of custody has been established, that's gone to the 

laboratory, the paper is produced, an outside witness 

testifies to what the paper means. I thought you said 

that that suffices.

 MR. FISHER: I did. So I think I'm --

here's what I'm saying.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you this. There 

are -- there are -- there are three possibility 

subjects: Chain of custody, conduct of test, 

significance or meaning of the squiggles. As I 

understand it, you have said if the chain of custody is 

established and if the squiggles are admitted in 

evidence, an expert who did not do the test can testify 

about the significance of the squiggles. But that 

leaves the question of the -- the evidence about the 

conduct of the test itself.

 And I understood you to say to me that you 

were not conceding that you did not have a -- a 

confrontation right to examine the person who did the 

test itself in order to determine admissibility.

 MR. FISHER: I think what we are doing here 

is disagreeing slightly over where chain of custody 

begins and ends. To the extent chain of custody gets 

you to the point at which the substance is put into the

machine, and that was stipulated to or otherwise not 

thought about, then, yes, the printout could be 

introduced into evidence and anyone could testify as to 

what that printout means. But to the extent that there 

was a gap between the drugs getting into the laboratory 

and being put into the machine by somebody that the 

defendant was not stipulating to, then whoever did 

that -- if the State were going to assert this is who 

did it and this is the drugs that we had -- that would 

be something that would be subject to cross-examination.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.
