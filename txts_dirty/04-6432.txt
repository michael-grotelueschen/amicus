 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument 

now in Aurelio Gonzalez v. James Crosby.

 Mr. Rashkind.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. RASHKIND

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. RASHKIND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 We confront today the Eleventh Circuit's 

categorical and jurisdictional prohibition of rule 60(b) 

in habeas corpus cases absent fraud. That is a rule that 

has been rejected by nearly all of the other circuits and, 

in fact, has been rejected by the United States in its 

amicus brief filed in this case.

 We urge the Court to adopt instead the approach 

of the other nine circuits that have commented on this 

issue, the functional approach, in which a court is deemed 

to examine each motion individually to determine whether 

or not the motion comports with both rule 60(b) and AEDPA.

 I think the test we proposed here is a fairly 

simple one, although I'm not sure in the briefing it comes 

across as being as simple as it really is, but the test we 

are proposing, as opposed to the test proposed by the 

United States, is the one being used in nearly all of the

other circuits and it has percolated through the system as 

one that seems to work very well. It's a two-part test 

and it's very simple I think. 

First, does the motion that's filed challenge 

the Federal judgment on a ground cognizable under one of 

the six prongs of rule 60(b)? If not, if it's really a 

new claim, if it is not within one of the six prongs of 

rule 60(b), then simply the district court denies it. 

If, on the other hand, the motion is a true 

60(b) motion, as ours was in this case, then the court 

goes to step two, which is to examine which is the six 

prongs is implicated, what is the jurisprudence regarding 

the six -- that particular prong, and how would it apply 

in this particular case. That's the functional approach 

that most of the circuits have been using. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: At that point when the court 

makes that examination under your rule and it comes to 

point six --

MR. RASHKIND: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- does it refer at any point 

or in any circumstance to AEDPA?

 MR. RASHKIND: It does not but -- but point six 

has been cabined by jurisprudence. Although point six 

appears to be a wide-open door for any motion to be filed 

and granted, the courts, even before AEDPA, have treated

category six as one that requires extraordinary 

circumstances. 

We have been able to quantify. Both an amicus 

who filed on behalf of the petitioner and the United 

States and the respondent have quantified the number of 

cases that have gone through the rule 60(b) process. 

There have only been, since AEDPA was passed, 28 

successful motions that we can quantify, that are 

published in any way. And we would like to think, at 

least, that if the State or the Federal Government thought 

there was an inappropriate application, it would have been 

raised on appeal and we'd have that statistic. 28 in the 

9-year history of the statute means fewer than 3 per year 

-- or slightly more than 3 per year for the whole country, 

a fraction for circuits. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, if we were to make 

clear that 60(b) is widely available, even category six, 

don't you think -- and as a result the AEDPA restrictions 

don't apply, don't you think that number would increase 

rather dramatically? 

MR. RASHKIND: I do not. And I do not because 

at this point apparently nine circuits are following the 

rule we propose, and so the statistics that both the 

respondent that we bring to you are that small, are that 

infinitesimal because the courts have always treated 60(b)

as a last ditch, extraordinary circumstances required. 

One can go through each of the six prongs and easily 

hypothesize examples that are appropriate, (b)(1), 

(b)(2) --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, there's no language in 

category six referring to extraordinary circumstances, any 

other reason justifying relief.

 MR. RASHKIND: The Court in the Ackermann 

decision -- there were two early decisions construing 

60(b). The first was the Klapprott decision in which the 

Court recognized that 60(b) is intended to correct the 

kind of errors that might occur that are important. The 

Ackermann decision followed a year later and said, 

however, this is not a wide-open door. Extraordinary 

circumstances are required. 

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But it's still very 

vague.

 MR. RASHKIND: It is but it isn't. It's vague 

in terms of reading the simple rule, but it's not vague if 

one considers the jurisprudence that surrounds the rule. 

One cannot ignore a half-century of -- of decisions, which 

have rejected 60(b)(6) and other 60(b) --

JUSTICE BREYER: All that is true, but I think 

that the court below and the other parties say -- almost 

everybody is on your side. However, they also note a

problem, and the problem is that given the very rigid 

structure of AEDPA and the imagination of lawyers, that if 

60(b) hasn't proved an escape hatch for getting around the 

AEDPA restriction, it will, and that what the lawyers will 

do is they will reconstruct what they'd like as a second 

habeas and put it in the form of a 60(b). 

And so I can accept everything you say, but if 

that in the back of my mind is a concern running around 

Congress in this way, what form of words could you put in 

to restrict 60(b) to its domain which is the domain in 

which it's been used so far? 

Now, the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation filed 

a brief in which they tried to do that. I thought that 

was a constructive effort. So what's your opinion --

MR. RASHKIND: Well, I would --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- about how best to do that?

 MR. RASHKIND: I would prefer to rely upon the 

Court's principles in this regard. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, but that's --

MR. RASHKIND: Rhines -- Rhines v. Weber is of 

good help here. Rhines v. Weber, that the Court delivered 

just very recently, considered the interaction of a rule 

and of AEDPA, and I thought it very clearly set forth 

three principles which work well within the test here. 

First, that there has to be good cause and good

cause, of course, is clear in the jurisprudence here, that 

we're talking about extraordinary circumstances, not a 

simple legal error. In this case, for example, the 

extraordinary circumstance is that, for all intents and 

purposes, my client has been denied his first petition of 

right because the court foreclosed the issues erroneously. 

So good cause is the first thing that I learned from 

Rhines.

 Secondly, that there have to be potentially 

meritorious underlying issues. Now, that's going to 

filter out a lot of the cases because you can't come into 

court with another issue that might not be good, it 

mightn't be an unexhausted issue, it might be --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's pretty flabby.

 MR. RASHKIND: -- one procedurally defaulted. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's pretty flabby. 

Potentially meritorious? Not probably, potentially.

 MR. RASHKIND: Well, it is -- it is the 

terminology used in Rhines. And what I'm trying to do 

here for the Court is to draw upon your own authority, the 

words you've spoken, as opposed to the test proposed by 

the Criminal Justice Foundation and by the United States, 

which are interesting tests but in no way depend upon the 

Court's own jurisprudence. I'm trying to offer the Court 

its own tests that have worked.

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But this is going to 

be taken up by some 800 district judges and a couple 

hundred appellate judges, and they're the ones who have 

the final say in most of these cases just because we 

decide so few.

 MR. RASHKIND: And I think that's why this test 

works.

 The third point would be that there be 

timeliness. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, aren't we dealing here 

with a time bar issue?

 MR. RASHKIND: We are. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I mean, there -- there was 

not a determination below, but an extraordinary amount of 

time expired before the application was made. Why would 

that count as some extraordinary circumstance? Why 

shouldn't the petitioner be stuck with the time bar? I 

don't see how this fits even under your proposed rule. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to ask the same 

question. It's about as pedestrian an issue as you could 

get. It comes up all the time. I mean, this is not a 

cosmic legal issue. 

MR. RASHKIND: It really isn't as pedestrian as 

it may have seemed. We underwent a change in the law, in 

AEDPA, that the Court has recognized is not fully clear.

And so this was one provision the Court had to clarify in 

Artuz v. Bennett, and there was a very small number of 

cases. I think we totaled eight in which relief was 

granted because district courts had incorrectly barred a 

petitioner from the first petition because it really 

wasn't a violation of -- of the statute of limitations. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- why did Florida deny 

relief in -- in the post-conviction? I mean, one reason 

that looks like it might apply is that Florida had a 2-

year statute of limitations and this was brought up 14 

years later. 

MR. RASHKIND: Well, it wasn't a 2-year statute 

of limitations, Your Honor. In fact, it was slightly 

different from the Federal statute of limitations as well. 

There is a provision that allows for newly discovered 

evidence to bypass the standard 2-year statute of 

limitations, which by the way, the Florida statute of 

limitations wasn't even adopted until well after my client 

was convicted. 

As you know, he says that he was told at his 

sentencing proceeding, you'll serve 13 years, thereabouts, 

on a 99-year sentence, and that induced his plea of guilty 

in this case. And when 13 years came about, he inquired 

what's happening and they said, no, that's not going to 

happen. You have a release date of 2057.

 And as I think the Court knows from its decision 

in Linz v. Mathis, Florida -- Florida statutes really 

changed in that way. Gain time was reduced gradually and 

then much more quickly so that someone who might have 

served 13 years in 1982 is really looking at serving the 

99. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying that counsel 

-- what -- what he alleges counsel told him was, in fact, 

accurate at the time counsel said it, that somebody who 

got a 99-year sentence wouldn't have to serve more than 13 

years?

 MR. RASHKIND: To be clear -- and -- and I want 

to be clear about his allegation is -- because he does not 

speak English -- that the interpreter told him this, and 

this was not during a plea colloquy. This was during 

discussions between the lawyer and the client through an 

interpreter in advance of the plea itself. And so his 

allegation has consistently been that that's what the 

interpreter told him his lawyer said. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But has that been 

determined --

MR. RASHKIND: No. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- by some court? That's the 

allegation --

MR. RASHKIND: Correct.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- pure and simple --

MR. RASHKIND: Correct. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- yet to be determined. 

MR. RASHKIND: And it's never been. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And so we have to know how 

the time bar element folds in here, and in an ordinary 

civil case, a time bar would be an adjudication on the 

merits. I mean, that -- that would end the case, and why 

would it be a different, more liberal rule in habeas?

 MR. RASHKIND: It is because that's the way the 

Court has treated the rule. The Court has always --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're -- you're saying it 

is extraordinary. 

MR. RASHKIND: In a different sense I'm saying 

it. In terms of computing whether a time bar is on the 

merits, the Court has not used that concept, which does 

relate to some sort of civil proceedings. Plaut would 

make it appear first to money judgment type cases. But 

the Court has not used that standard, for example, in 

Martinez-Villareal, has not used it in Slack v. McDaniel.

 Instead, the Court has not looked at the 

nomenclature of the order that dismissed the case or 

denied this case. Instead, the Court looks to did the --

the court below address the claims of the petitioner. And 

of course, a claim of statute of limitations is not a

claim of a petitioner. That's an affirmative defense of 

the State. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Counsel, what -- that --

that brings me to a question that I don't understand about 

your argument. It seems to me you're biting off more than 

you have to bite off here. Would you win on the following 

argument? And I will tell you in advance that it looks to 

me as though you would. But maybe there's some reason 

you're not making it. 

Number one, your statute of limitations claim is 

not the kind of claim that AEDPA is concerned with when it 

deals with limits on second and successive petitions.

 Number two, although a statute of limitations 

issue is on the merits, it is not on the merits in the 

second or successive petition category. In this case, you 

don't have to worry about making a -- an -- an AEDPA end 

run so far as second or successive goes, and therefore, 

60(b) can be used simply not as a wide-open door, but as a 

door that could be opened when your claim is a claim about 

a rule that barred you from getting into Federal court, 

which is what the statute of limitations rule does. 

That's all you're asking for. 

MR. RASHKIND: That's right. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: And finally, you have an 

extraordinary situation here because you have a later

determination in Artuz which declared the law not as a 

change in the law, but as what the law presumably meant 

from day one. 

As I understand it, if we accepted that 

argument, you would win. Do you agree?

 MR. RASHKIND: Yes, sir. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why don't you make that 

argument? 

MR. RASHKIND: I do make that argument, and to 

the extent -- and -- and I make that argument, but that 

argument was rejected in the court below which addressed 

it with a completely different approach. And so I begin 

in this Court by having to address where I was in the 

Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you go back to the 

district court before the Eleventh Circuit? You've now 

told me that the ground on which the Florida court denied 

relief was not based on the statute of limitations. 

Right?

 MR. RASHKIND: Correct. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the Federal court, what is 

the ground on which relief was denied and how would Artuz 

affect that decision? 

MR. RASHKIND: In the Federal court, the 

district judge said that the tolling provision would not

apply here because it was the district court's 

determination that it was untimely when filed in the State 

court. That was not, however, the position of the Florida 

courts. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but your -- your immediate 

concern is how do I get into a Federal court. Whether you 

win or lose once you get in there is another problem, but 

I -- as I understand it, that's not what we're dealing 

with here. And -- and the -- you -- you were kept out of 

the district court on a statute of limitations issue. If 

you can say -- if you argue all I've got in front of you, 

us, is a statute of limitations issue, that's all I want 

under -- to raise under 60(b) and I have an extraordinary 

claim here because of the subsequent Artuz decision, that 

will get you into Federal court, if we accept that 

argument. Whether -- whether you win or lose, once you 

get there, I don't know, and I don't know that that's 

before us.

 MR. RASHKIND: And it is not clear. I wish it 

were because that's precisely what my pro se client wrote 

in his rule 60(b) motion. He said I have been denied my 

right to a first petition because of an incorrect 

determination on the statute of limitations, that the 

Artuz decision makes clear that I was entitled to a 

tolling period that I was not awarded, and I would like

the judgment modified or reopened. And that's as clear as 

a pro se litigant can make that claim. That's what the 

claim has been from the very beginning, long before I was 

ever his counsel. 

JUSTICE BREYER: You -- you had a question. 

Remember my -- you were giving me the three principles to 

prevent the end run. 

MR. RASHKIND: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And the first was good cause. 

The second was potentially meritorious underlying issues, 

and the third is?

 MR. RASHKIND: No indication of dilatory tactics 

by the plaintiff. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you. 

MR. RASHKIND: And this is very helpful I think 

because it gives those three rules, which the Court has 

given us in Rhines, helped us and helped the district 

court to sort out the things that shouldn't be stopping or 

reopening proceedings. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May -- may I ask you a 

question that may be a little bit collateral? There was 

disagreement on the court of appeals, as I remember it, as 

to whether or not a COA requirement applies to a denial of 

a 60(b) motion. What is your view on that issue?

 MR. RASHKIND: Well, I actually argued and I do

believe that it shouldn't require a COA. And the reason 

is because -- part of the reason is because this case 

began before Slack v. McDaniel and continued after. And I 

think that's where Judge Tjoflat's opinion came from. How 

can someone whose case is dismissed procedurally ever get 

a COA? It's impossible because there's never going to be 

a constitutional issue. By virtue of the procedural 

ruling, the constitutional was not addressed. 

And Judge Tjoflat continued that dissenting 

position through the en banc decision, and I share the 

view that it is virtually impossible, if not completely 

impossible, in the typical case of a procedural resolution 

of the case, to ever get a COA. 

In this case, majority would point to the 

fact the my client did receive a certificate of 

appealability, but I don't think there are many others who 

will every get it because the question presented was, is a 

rule 60(b) still viable post AEDPA? And that question 

won't recur, certainly not after the Court rules here. 

And I think the very genuine concern that Judge Tjoflat 

had was and that he -- that he articulated is it's 

virtually impossible to get appellate review. 

One of the things we know about habeas corpus 

is --

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, we're not

talking about ordinary appellate review. We're talking 

about an appeal from an adverse decision by a Federal 

habeas court. 

MR. RASHKIND: Correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: So that isn't quite 

as strange as you make it sound. 

MR. RASHKIND: It is for this reason, Mr. Chief 

Justice. Before, you could file successive applications. 

In the early days of habeas corpus, you could file 

successive applications. And the reason given was there 

was no appeal. And so you could go from one judge to the 

next judge because there were no appeals. Then, of 

course, we had appeals, and the reason for having 

successive petitions would diminish. 

But what has happened to the appeal in a habeas 

corpus case is it has become so constrained that in many 

respects it doesn't exist, and that's what happened here. 

Here's my client who faces a situation in which he has 

clearly been thrown out of court improperly, and he goes 

to the court of appeals to have that decision reviewed and 

can't get past the gateway of the certificate of 

appealability. And so he has no opportunity to really 

have an appellate review. He has none.

 CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Well, but maybe that's 

what Congress wanted.

 MR. RASHKIND: I don't think Congress did intend 

that. When we looked --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But why isn't that always the 

case if it's time-barred?

 MR. RASHKIND: If it is time --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: If it's time-barred, you 

never have your chance to have the merits argued.

 MR. RASHKIND: Well, that's one of the ways in 

which a case could be dismissed procedurally, but it's not 

time-barred if the court rules it was erroneously. And 

that's the concern that I think my client has here. 

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: But at what point do we bring 

this all to a halt? I mean, there's always one more argument 

to make that the last court to rule against me was wrong.

 MR. RASHKIND: One of the nice things about rule 

60(b) is it really is a disciplined approach to a court 

examining its own mistakes. It isn't a wide-open door in 

any respect. It is a disciplined approach. There are six 

specific grounds, and even though the sixth one looks like 

it's wide-open, it certainly isn't under the jurisprudence 

of the Court. 

And so what this does is provide a very 

important opportunity for a judge to be able to look at an 

intervening decision from the Supreme Court of the United 

States and say, I have denied this person what Congress

wanted them to have. There's no question. One reads 

AEDPA and one thing is very clear. They -- Congress 

intended for a person who has exhausted claims, not 

procedurally defaulted them in State court, and has filed 

a timely petition, that person under 2254 is entitled to 

have the claim entertained. And when a court makes a 

mistake, a procedural mistake, that forgoes or eliminates 

the opportunity for review, and that's barely reviewable on 

appeal, depending on how the certificate of appealability 

may be phrased -- and often these folks are pro se -- I 

think what happens is 2254 has failed and what Congress 

intended to happen isn't going to happen. The person was 

entitled to one petition, one bite at the apple and never 

receives that bite at the apple. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, now, the Federal 

Government has a different proposed rule than yours. Are 

you going to comment on their proposal?

 MR. RASHKIND: I will. With due deference to my 

colleagues, it's 177 words long, over two pages. And 

that's why I thought that the approach that we brought to 

the Court from the other nine circuits is a simpler --

what I would call a simple two-step. 

Their approach actually can be read, as we did 

in our reply brief, to fit within our own rule, but I 

think the problem with the Government's rule is it is so

broad and it does not rely upon any of the Court's 

precedents in -- in its writing. And so what you do, if 

you adopt a rule like that, first of all, is create 

confusion. And secondly, what you do is you make a whole 

new set of rules that are separate and apart from what you 

-- the Court has previously done in its AEDPA 

jurisprudence. 

To be able to touch upon Slack v. McDaniel, to 

be able to draw upon Martinez-Villareal, to be able to 

take from Rhines v. Weber, create a formula and a package 

that's familiar to the courts, to take a rule that's 177 

words long that the Government puts together that I 

interpret as being favorable to my client and they 

interpret as being unfavorable to my client, I think just 

puts the kind of difficulty in the courts that this case 

should try to avoid. 

So my comment on it is that it may well, if it's 

read as we did in our reply brief, be the same thing that 

we're saying and what I refer to as a simple two-step 

test. And if not, it's just going to be a source of great 

confusion. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the -- you -- you 

said 60(b) fits this like a glove because it's the 

district court correcting its own errors. But it isn't 

usually -- 60(b) was framed with the idea of the district

court being the very first instance court. And here you 

will have the district court as the third going up the 

ladder. So -- and -- and given that the habeas rules say 

that -- that civil rules are applicable but have to be 

modified to be compatible with habeas jurisdiction. 

MR. RASHKIND: I think it's very important to 

realize that both rule 81 of the Federal Rules of Civil 

Procedure and rule 11 of the rules of habeas procedure, 

which the State would have us use as a constraint, really 

are the first things that tell us that there's supposed to 

be a functional approach. Both of those rules tell us 

that the rules apply to the extent that they're 

compatible, and so that's certainly not a categorical 

approach. That is a functional approach. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the Government, by 

the way, seems a broader rule than yours. The only thing 

it rules out is new legal claims or new evidence. I don't 

see anything in your -- tell me if I'm wrong, but I don't 

see anywhere where you say we should be able to bring a 

60(b) motion based on new legal claims or new evidence. 

MR. RASHKIND: New legal -- this is the part 

that I think we have to look both at 60(b) and the 

statute. New claims -- new claims -- are brought under 

2244(b)(2). Same claims are either going to be barred by 

(b)(1) or, if heard at all, under 60(b).

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it's even -- but I want 

to know why -- why -- there's some reason you don't like 

the Government, and -- and -- other than fact that they 

must hurt you in some way. I don't see how it hurts you. 

MR. RASHKIND: Well, I don't think it does, but 

they do. So that troubles me. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- make us --

MR. RASHKIND: They make an argument that under 

their test, my client should not prevail. I can make an 

argument under our test my client prevails. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And under their test too, you 

say it's applying the same rule of -- it's not a new 

claim. It's the same claim as -- as -- just that they --

shows that the district judge got it wrong.

 MR. RASHKIND: I think the heart of the 

Government's position is it requires a much more radical 

departure from general procedure than a simple change of 

law. But I don't think it's a simple change of law, for 

example, when it is an intervening decision that 

interprets a statute that was in effect and that the

mistake of not interpreting correctly is to effectively 

bar the first bite at the habeas apple. 

Now, the Government does not give that ground in 

their test, and I think it's important that the Court 

leave that door open. And that's why I think our test is 

better and theirs in inadequate. 

I think ultimately we come down to three issues 

that support the position that we're taking. Chief Judge 

Edmonson made note of this in his concurring and 

dissenting opinion. He was troubled that we were not 

giving effect to both laws that Congress had approved, 

60(b) and AEDPA. By virtue of the majority rule, 60(b) 

had been categorically eliminated. And I think the 

position we take before the Court today is that the Court 

should honor both provisions that Congress has adopted.

 May I reserve the balance of my time?

Rashkind.

 This case presents a fundamental inconsistency 

to this Court. Congress said through AEDPA that a habeas 

petitioner is to take all their claims, put them in one 

basket, bring them to court within 1 year, and a sovereign 

State is going to defend that judgment in Federal court 

one time. Rule 60(b) says, petitioner, use as many 

baskets as you need, take as long as you like, and the 

State, you're going to have to keep coming back over and 

over and over again.

 And this case here presents that -- that very 

problem. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that an exaggeration of 

how 60(b) works in practice? It isn't that every civil 

judgment can come back and back again with 60(b) motions. 

The district courts have been rather disciplined in 

handling 60(b) motions. So I think you have exaggerated 

what 60(b) does in the ordinary civil rules context.

 MR. KISE: Well, respectfully, Justice Ginsburg, 

I -- I would disagree with that in this sense. I would 

disagree with it in the sense that as Justice O'Connor 

pointed out, if this Court were to open that door, I think 

you would see that sort of abuse. I think you would see 

that sort of manipulation of the process. I think you 

would see that sort of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But have we seen it in the --

there are other circuits who do adopt that rule, aren't 

there? And have we seen the abuse you're describing?

 MR. KISE: We have not yet, but I would submit 

to Your Honor that that is because there is still this 

uncertainty because this case is here before this Court, 

and -- and because this has not yet been approved. If 

this is approved by this Court, then you're going to see 

sovereign States like Florida dragged back in here nearly 

25 years later --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that depends --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I had the same comment 

or the same reaction as Justice Ginsburg. Forget about 

the habeas area. Just in -- with general civil judgments, 

have there been Law Review articles saying that rule 60(b) 

undermines finality? People kept going back, back, and 

back. I -- I thought quite the opposite, that we were 

living very well with rule 60(b). 

MR. KISE: Well, in -- in the ordinary civil 

context, that's perhaps correct, Your Honor, but -- but 

this isn't the ordinary civil context. This is the habeas 

context. And Congress has said that this is the structure 

that we want to take. This is the rule that we want to 

take. And as this Court has recognized that -- that AEDPA 

was passed with -- with this enduring respect for 

finality, this respect for the sovereignty of States.

State, you're only going to have to come back here one 

time. You're only supposed to litigate one time, one --

all the claims in one basket. They're brought within 1 

year, and the State is to defend its judgment one time 

because --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But his -- his whole 

argument is you, State, get exactly what you're entitled 

to if I win on 60(b) because what I was entitled to and 

what you were entitled to was the 1-year statute but 

subject to the rule in Artuz. That's all you get, State. 

And what he is saying is, I want to get back into court so 

that I can have the statute of limitations -- the benefit 

of the statute of limitations as Artuz construed it. That 

means you, State, get what you want and I get my one 

chance. How is that an open door to the abuse that you're 

talking about? 

MR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, again, there --

there has to be some finality to the process, and -- and 

here what the petitioner got was at the time a 

perceptively correct view of the law. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: He got what Artuz said was an 

erroneous view of the statute of limitations. 

MR. KISE: 2 years after the district judge made 

his ruling in this particular case. And it -- it was in 

this particular case 2 years. It could be 10 years. It

that if --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And do you -- do you think that 

there is -- that there is this -- this sort of tidal wave 

of -- of erroneous statute of limitations determinations 

that, if Artuz is applied, will suddenly be coming 5, 10, 

and 20 years into Federal court? I mean, it -- it -- your 

argument, in relation to his particular claim seems 

exaggerated.

 MR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, it's not 

exaggerated when you look at it from the standpoint that 

-- that Congress intended us to be in court one time to 

defend this judgment in Federal court. We were there. He 

received a --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you were there for the 

purpose of getting him booted out. I mean, you didn't --

you didn't get into the merits of anything. 

MR. KISE: Well, he received a -- a final 

disposition on the non-technical procedural basis which 

was the applicable law at the time. He received that 

adjudication and --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it was not the 

applicable law at the time. The decision related back to 

before that hearing.

respectfully, eviscerate any -- any notion of -- of the 

statute of limitations --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No. Sometimes there are law-

changing decisions, but this was not a law-changing 

decision. It's a decision interpreting what the law was 

from the date of its enactment. 

MR. KISE: But based on that, Your Honor, then 

there would be no statute of limitations. If -- if that 

decision came out 10 years from now, we would then be back 

in this Court on a 60(b) motion, which I would submit is 

fundamentally inconsistent with what Congress intended. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: If there had been an Artuz 

violation and not every statute of limitations 

determination implicates Artuz.

 MR. KISE: That's correct, Your Honor. But at 

the same time, there may be some other mistake or some 

other excusable neglect or some other issue that comes up.

 I mean, what Congress intended to prevent is not 

just the successful filing of a 60(b) or the successful 

revisiting, if you will, of the judgment. It -- it 

intended to prevent the actual attempt itself. I mean, 

the idea is -- is that once this judgment is adjudicated, 

once we've had this adjudication, you are not to come 

back. You are not to --

principally concerned with -- Congress was concerned with 

two things. It was concerned with second and successive. 

That's not what is before us. Congress was also concerned 

with a 1-year statute of limitations. What is before us 

on that point is that this guy did not get the benefit of 

the statute of limitations that he had a right to get the 

benefit of, that there was a flat mistake of law. So by 

-- by recognizing his statute of limitations claim, we do 

not open the door to second and successive litigation. We 

open the door simply to Artuz problems on statute of 

limitations rulings and that's a pretty narrow category it 

seems to me. 

MR. KISE: But I would -- I would respectfully 

disagree with Your Honor's premise that -- that he -- he's 

not seeking to revisit an adjudicated petition. He did --

he is seeking, as -- as we see it, to --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. Sure, he does. And if 

it's second and successive, he's going to get thrown out 

again. 

MR. KISE: And we would submit that it is second 

and successive because it's seeking to revisit that 

adjudication, an adjudication that was had on a non-

technical procedural basis. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So that's the --

but that's what district courts are there for.

 MR. KISE: But -- but the Congress intended to 

take that discretion away from the district courts. 

2244(b)(1) says you will not look at it again, and 

2244(b)(3) says, in fact, that when you do go back to 

potentially revisit an issue, when you do go back to 

potentially look at a second or successive, that it's not 

even the same district judge that makes that 

determination. As in 60(b), you go back to the same 

judge. 2244(b)(3) says, no, a three-judge panel of a 

circuit court of appeals must first determine whether or 

not you even have a right to get in --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's also true of (b)(3).

 MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: And not even the Eleventh 

Circuit said (b)(3). And therefore, you want to say 

absolute, or are we really talking about which 60(b) 

motions escape the strictures of AEDPA?

 MR. KISE: Well, I -- I think we're talking 

about which 60(b)(3) motions -- or 60(b) motions do escape 

the strictures of AEDPA.

the court by the adverse party, to escape, but should your 

own witness turn out to have been committing his own fraud 

for whatever set of reasons, you can't.

 MR. KISE: Well, I would -- I would say why 

fraud -- to answer your question, Your Honor, why fraud --

let me back up first to the premise that -- that our 

position and the Government's position are that far apart. 

I would respectfully say that -- that we are not that far 

apart. I do not see that much light between the 

positions, although I know their brief leaves some room --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, under I guess the 

Government, you can bring everything under 60(b). By the 

way, if they do bring a motion to reopen under 60(b) 

because of change of law, they're almost bound to lose. 

There are hardly any cases which find that an adequate 

ground under 60(b). 

But they let you do anything under 60(b), I take 

it, as long as the claims presented do not -- as long as 

they are not trying to obtain relief on the basis of new 

legal claims or new evidence. 

Now, I just noticed there's another one here.

Do not support habeas relief. Maybe that's the problem. 

MR. KISE: Perhaps I --

JUSTICE BREYER: You explain. I -- I thought 

when I first read this, that this was quite broad, but I 

may not have read it perfectly.

 MR. KISE: Well, and I don't want to pretend to 

speak for the United States because -- because that --

that might cause me to misspeak. 

But to answer your question about why fraud is 

different, I -- I have three bases for why fraud is 

different and why we think that that exception is the 

right exception.

 One, this Court has said in the past that fraud 

is different than other things. In the Hazel case that's 

cited in Calderon, this Court has said that tampering with 

the administration of justice through fraud involves more 

than an injury to a single litigant. It is a wrong 

against the very institutions designed to safeguard the 

public, institutions that cannot tolerate fraud.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So is that also true if his own 

witness has committed the fraud?

 MR. KISE: Well, I -- I would -- our fraud 

exception that -- that we -- we are delineating here is 

material, intentional conduct that subverts the process. 

And it can't be just anyone, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MR. KISE: It needs to be someone in a position 

to subvert the process for -- for a purpose like the 

Government or the court if you -- if -- a judge that's 

been bribed in the unusual example of that, or -- or the 

-- the subornation of perjury in the Hazel sense. Those 

examples -- that would be fraud that I think is what this 

Court was talking about in Hazel --

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: What about a claim 

that a witness perjured himself, a witness for the 

government, during trial?

 MR. KISE: Well, a witness for -- a -- a claim 

that a witness for the government perjured himself during 

the trial would certainly implicate material, intentional 

conduct designed to subvert the process. And one of the 

advantages to using fraud is -- is that it is a familiar 

bright line, workable standard for district courts. And 

with fraud, you have to plead a little bit more 

particularly, and so you would avoid in some respects some 

of the question marks that would come up --

JUSTICE BREYER: And all I'm saying is exactly 

whatever criteria is met, that it happens to be his own 

witness, and sometimes your own witnesses do have their 

little games, you know, with prisoners, and so it's the 

same thing.

 MR. KISE: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: Does that not count too?

 MR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, I think that would 

leave so much room for mischief, it would not be possible 

to contain the potential for -- for abuse. I mean, if 

every jailhouse snitch were -- were subject to -- to the 

-- the 60(b) exception that we're -- we're articulating 

here, if every -- every petitioner could simply say, well, 

my own witness that I put up on the stand -- that -- that 

witness perjured himself or herself, then -- then the 

opportunity for mischief would abound, and we would be 

back in the same position that we would be in general with 

-- with States having to respond again. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kise, this may be 

important. Do you agree with Mr. Rashkind that in the 

Florida court the dismissal or the denial of relief was 

not on the Florida statute of limitations --

MR. KISE: No, Your Honor. We -- we would 

submit that it is on the statute of limitations, that --

that rule 3.850 provided the petitioner with 2 years 

within which to apply, and both of his petitions were 

dismissed on statute of limitations grounds. And I don't 

know that that matters --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not -- not clear 

from --

 MR. KISE: -- to the end result here, but -- but 

that -- that's our position. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not what the -- this 

is -- the -- the form of dismissal in the Florida Supreme 

Court doesn't tell us that. It just says something about 

allegations contained therein do not constitute legal 

grounds for granting the new trial. 

MR. KISE: Your Honor may be referring to the 

second 3.850 dismissal, and that second 3.850 didn't meet 

the requirements of the successive rule. There -- there 

was a first --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The first one was on the 

statute of limitations? 

MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor, and then the second 

one was also on the statute of limitations in addition to 

the fact that it did not meet the requirements of -- of 

the successive rule because it was essentially the same 

claim raised again. He raised the same claim a second 

time. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have that anyplace at 

-- in the papers before us, the first -- the first 

dismissal in the Florida -- in the Florida trial court?

 MR. KISE: I'm not sure exactly where it is in 

the appendix, Your Honor. Let me see. I -- I don't know 

that we do. I know we have reference to it, but I don't

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said --

MR. KISE: It is -- it is in the Eleventh 

Circuit opinion, I believe, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that it was based on the 

Florida 2-year statute of limitations. 

MR. KISE: Yes. I believe -- when I said 

opinion, I'm sorry. The Eleventh Circuit record, Your 

Honor. It is in the Eleventh Circuit record, the -- the 

decision of the Florida court. But it is not in the 

appendix before this Court.

 But returning again to Justice Breyer, because I 

don't think I finished my three reasons. 

The first was because this Court said and says 

fraud is different. 

The second is because there never was a first 

review in that sense. I mean, they never obtained the 

first review that they -- they were seeking. 

And the third is -- is the State's finality 

interest, which this Court has -- has recognized as -- as 

near paramount under certain circumstances, must yield 

where you have the presence of fraud. And -- and so 

that's why Florida maintains that this is the correct and 

-- and only exception. And -- and there are several 

reasons that we maintain that this is the correct and only

exception.

 The first and -- and most important, and -- and 

as I started this presentation, is that this is the only 

exception that preserves congressional intent. 

The second is -- is that AEDPA and rule 60(b) 

cannot coexist except in very narrow circumstances because 

they address the same subject matter in fundamentally 

different ways. 

And the third is, as I mentioned before, because 

the court --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But is it correct that they 

address the same subject matter? Isn't 60(b) directed at 

the integrity of the habeas proceeding, whereas AEDPA is 

directed at the integrity of the original conviction?

 MR. KISE: Well, I -- I would respectfully 

disagree with Your Honor because 2244(b)(1) does deal with 

the -- the revisiting of the Federal habeas petition. The 

2244(b)(1) specifically applies to the revisitation of the 

Federal habeas petition. And in -- in terms of how they 

deal with the same subject matter in different ways, as I 

began, AEDPA's whole purpose is to provide one basket of 

claims within 1 year so the State has to defend one time, 

and 60(b) allows for the potential -- and -- and I would 

submit to you more than just the potential if this Court 

were to approve a standard -- for -- for repetitive

claims, many baskets, many -- many years, and -- and many 

times that the State has to come back. 

And as I say, in this case the -- the principle 

of finality is all but abolished in this case and all be 

eviscerated simply by the fact that nearly 25 years later 

Florida is still in this Court defending this judgment 

that was based on a guilty plea, not even a -- a 

conviction. And -- and as this Court recognized, albeit 

not as part of the holding, but -- but mentioned in -- in 

Calderon with respect to the enduring respect for 

finality, this is something that has survived both direct 

and post-conviction review in the State court system.

 I mean, this is -- this is Federal review of a 

sovereign State's determination as to the application of 

its criminal laws, and Congress has made a policy 

determination that -- that that Federal review must be 

limited because State -- State exercise of its -- of its 

police power and -- and the enforcement of its judgments 

is something that needs to be respected.

 And Congress -- because the power to grant 

habeas is given by written law, Congress has the power to 

make that policy determination. And while the petitioner 

argues that 60(b) somehow strikes a balance, I would 

submit to this Court that Congress has already struck that 

balance. Congress has already made that determination.

There isn't another balance to be struck by the use of 

60(b), but that a balance has already been struck by 

Congress and Congress has made a determination that in 

most circumstances finality is going to trump. 

And this isn't a perfect system. There are 

going to be exceptions with any bright line rule. With 

any bright line rule that this Court has ever carved 

out --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't Congress rule -- rule 

out 60(b) in -- in death cases?

 MR. KISE: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Specifically 

rule out 60(b) --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, yes.

 MR. KISE: -- in -- in capital cases. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 

MR. KISE: I don't know -- under the statute? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. I may be wrong about 

having --

MR. KISE: I'm not certain. We -- we're 

submitting that the Congress under -- under AEDPA ruled 

out 60(b) in all cases with the exception of -- of the 

fraud. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was a special 

provision for capital cases.

 MR. KISE: I don't believe so, Your Honor.

 But with respect to the bright line rule that --

that we submit is necessary to effectuate congressional 

intent, as I was saying, that it's not a perfect system. 

And the petitioner can come up with all manner of examples 

that -- that seem to implicate various policy 

determinations about what should or should not happen in a 

given situation.

 But -- but our position -- and we believe the 

position of the Eleventh Circuit is -- is that Congress 

has already weighed that now. Congress has already made 

that determination. Congress has already told us where 

the line is going to be drawn and it's going to be drawn 

on the side of finality and it's going to be drawn on the 

side of respect for State sovereignty. 

And I would -- would also submit that -- that 

the Sixth Circuit test and the functional equivalent 

approach test that's advanced by the petitioner ignores 

really both the statute and it ignores reality. It 

ignores the statute because AEDPA tells us you can't 

revisit an adjudicated habeas petition unless there are 

certain limited circumstances that are met. And it 

ignores reality because the only reason to revisit a 

habeas petition is to ultimately revisit the underlying 

State court judgment. And the only purpose for being 

there is to ultimately get at that State court conviction

that is -- that is under siege.

 With respect to the coexistence, the petitioner 

made a point about this case is somehow like the Rhines 

case that was decided recently by this Court. But in the 

Rhines case, this Court was balancing the exhaustion 

requirements with the statute of limitations provisions. 

Here there's nothing to balance. Here this is just simply 

a prohibition. Congress says you cannot revisit except in 

these isolated, limited circumstances. And so rule 81, 

habeas rule 11, and this Court's decision in Pitchess all 

say that 60(b) does not trump if the habeas statute holds 

differently. 

And finally, the courts do need a bright line 

that's not subject to variance, as I mentioned earlier. 

This is a workable standard. They're familiar with fraud. 

It's well defined in the case law. It requires more 

particularized pleading which makes less room for 

mischief, and it -- it gives the courts an easily 

identifiable standard by which they can effectuate that 

congressional policy, that congressional policy of one 

basket of claims within 1 year and the State will come 

into this Federal court one time to defend its sovereign 

judgment. 

If there are no further questions, thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Kise.

simple, and that is a rule 60(b) motion that seeks to set 

aside a denial of habeas relief on the grounds that it was 

incorrectly decided is barred. That is the territory that 

AEDPA occupies. That includes, Justice Souter, not just 

determinations on the --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Would you say that again?

 MS. MILLETT: A rule 60(b) motion that seeks to 

set aside a final judgment denying Federal habeas relief 

on the grounds that it was incorrectly decided is a second 

or successive petition under AEDPA. It can proceed only 

under AEDPA's terms, which change not only the standards 

for a second decision, but the decision-maker, the 

gatekeeper. 

Justice Souter --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that a statement of when 

it's not available? I want to be sure I -- are you 

stating it positively or negatively?

 MS. MILLETT: It --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It is not available in the 

circumstance you described. Right?

determination. If you are seeking to upset a final 

determination, you are governed by 2244 not 60(b).

 If you are not seeking to upset a final 

determination, let me give you the two -- the two 

circumstances that come to mind right away. 

One is the fraud exception recognized by the 

court of appeals, and there could be similar errors like 

that -- and this is what we talk about in our brief -- that 

essentially vitiate the existence of a determination in 

the first place. They are that profound and that 

rudimentary. Then you are not upsetting what our system 

recognizes to be a determination and what Congress wanted 

you to have. 

The other exception is essentially 60(a), 

clerical -- you're not -- errors. You're not really 

upsetting anything. You're actually trying to implement 

or effectuate the actual ruling by the court of appeals.

 The only gap -- I'm not sure it's a gap at all 

after the argument here -- is that we don't limit it to 

fraud. We recognize that there are some other 

foundational, rudimentary, fundamental errors that 

conceivably could occur. I'm not aware of them happening, 

but something like a biased judge addressed by this Court 

in Toomey v. Ohio. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But now you're into -- I mean,

you can use a tone of voice. You know, it sounds very 

strong. But I thought 60(b)(6) is weird things happen, 

and 60(b)(1) is there are all kinds of mistakes. You 

know, some of them can just be accidental. The lawyer was 

hit by a trolley. And in fact, all of 60(b) is meant to 

capture that kind of thing. 

So it sounds like what you're saying is, sure, 

follow 60(b), maybe not the evidentiary, maybe not the new 

evidence part, follow it, but be sure you do so strictly. 

Are you saying more than that?

 MS. MILLETT: I am saying a lot more than that, 

and that is, first of all, because the vast majority of 

things that are covered by 60(b) do not qualify as 

tantamount to fraud or a biased judge. 

And -- and the second incredibly important thing 

is that Congress changed the decision-maker. Under 60(b), 

you have 645 individual district court judges applying the 

historic equity power to -- to overturn final judgments. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Where -- where do you disagree 

with Judge Carnes?

 MS. MILLETT: With Judge? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: With -- with the majority of 

-- in -- in the Eleventh Circuit. 

MS. MILLETT: If that opinion is read -- and I 

think fairly it has to be -- as saying only fraud and not

errors of similar magnitude like a biased judge or some 

other complete breakdown so that our system doesn't 

recognize that to be a judgment -- it's not what Congress 

thought it was giving you -- then that would be -- I can't 

tell you there's cases where this happens, but that -- but 

the -- the rationale for including fraud would exclude --

include some other similar errors of magnitude. That's 

our only --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, how do you apply it in 

this case, the Artuz problem? 

MS. MILLETT: In -- in this case, the Artuz 

problem is only an argument, and I -- we're not even 

accepting that it's accurate, but only an argument that 

the court made a mistake of law. A mistake of law is not 

a fundamental breakdown in our system. It does not mean 

the court didn't act as a court. This Court reverses in 

-- or vacates in about 75 percent of its cases. It doesn't 

mean all the lower courts were not operating as courts as 

we recognize them as at the same level of fraud. It's 

routine to have mistakes of law --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose Artuz had been 

decided and it was in the mail and the judge forgot to 

open his advance sheets that day. And so he goes back to 

his office, says, oh, my God. You know, I mean, a weird 

thing like that. And of course, he says nobody has been

hurt yet. I'll reopen it. Okay? Is that all right?

 MS. MILLETT: If he does it within 10 days under 

rule --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it's 10 days and a half.

 MS. MILLETT: 10 --

(Laughter.) 

MS. MILLETT: Then, Justice Breyer, the nature 

of lines is somebody falls on the other side sometimes. 

There's an appeal process to deal with exactly that. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And the reason that it's 

happened is because all the lawyers were hit by four 

trolleys. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, you see what I'm doing? 

I'm simply trying to find cases that fit within the 

language, but they're very weird and justice cries out for 

a reopening. Now, that's what it seems to me one is 

about. Two is about. Three doesn't really. Three you 

agree applies. Two may not apply. Three you agree 

applies. Four I think you probably agree applies or not 

at all. Five doesn't apply at all, and six is anything 

under the sun. 

MS. MILLETT: Justice Breyer, the problem is --

and -- and Justice Souter, you referenced this. There 

have been many references to this, that 60(b) is not a

problem. It's already cabined out there. In fact, it's 

not. It's abuse of discretion review in courts of 

appeals.

 We cite a case, Hamilton v. Newland, from the 

Ninth Circuit where they used 60(b)(6). The -- the 

petitioner filed his claims. They were clearly barred by 

the statute of limitations, not an Artuz problem. So he 

said, all right, I'm going back to Federal court with a 

60(b)(6) claim. I'm actually innocent. That puts me in 

60(b)(6). I admit actual innocence. It's -- it's a very 

weak claim. I can't been get relief on it. But the 

district court said, come on in. I'm going to decide your 

claims. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe --

MS. MILLETT: And the -- and the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- maybe the district court 

shouldn't have done that, but whatever -- whatever was 

wrong there, it was merely a classic application of -- of 

review of a statute of limitations point. There -- there 

was much else involved and maybe it was improper. 

My question, I guess, is why do you say that the 

-- why do you assume that the policy animating applying 

60(b) to a gatekeeping issue like statute of limitations, 

where there is an unusual circumstance as in Artuz, should 

be the same policy that animates applying 60(b), let's

say, when there is an attempt to -- to make an end run 

around the second and successive rules?

 The latter I think we can all understand pretty 

readily. I mean, it's very important. You've got the --

the -- AEDPA if you allow that.

 With respect to this kind of a statute of 

limitations problem, what the guy is asking for is what he 

was entitled to under AEDPA as a matter of timing and 

gatekeeping. Why is the policy under 60(b) the same in 

those two cases?

 MS. MILLETT: Justice Souter, there's two 

answers to that. The first is that this won't be -- it 

will be hard to limit this to a statute of limitations 

because the next argument is going to be procedural 

default, and the next argument is going to be 

misapplication of Teague's non-retroactivity principle, 

and the next one is going to be mistake in applying 

adequate, independent State grounds. 

The -- a bulk -- a huge percentage of Federal 

court decision-making in habeas cases is procedural rules 

because Federal habeas is not a roving commission for 

error correction. You have to -- at -- in the same breath 

that you establish a constitutional violation, you have to 

show it's proper for Federal courts to act. Procedural 

default and statute of limitations are as much your job to

show to have Federal relief as it is to show that 

something went wrong under the Constitution. It's a --

there's a dual character to Federal habeas relief. So 

this, in fact, is exactly part of the habeas -- this is 

part of the second or successive determinations that --

applications that Congress wanted to bar. 

And we have to step back and think about what 

would happen here. What we have is the State of Florida 

coming up 23 years after a guilty plea not because to 

defend -- once again, it's judgment. It's conviction not 

because of anything they did in the conduct of the trial, 

not because the guy claims to be actually innocent, but 

because almost 2 decades after the plea, a Federal court 

allegedly made a mistake of law that wasn't cleared up 

through the appellate process. That's not the point of 

Federal habeas corpus. That's not what it's supposed to 

be about.

 But if we open the door, if we let the camel's 

nose in the tent, a camel is going to come behind it, and 

it's going to be procedural default, non-retroactivity of 

Teague, and all of the multiple other grounds on which 

Federal habeas decisions are made by courts. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the Federal court make a 

mistake of -- of law if the -- if the Florida court 

dismissed under the Florida 2-year statute of limitations?

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But do you agree with Mr. 

Kise that the first dismissal in the Florida court, the 

first denial was on the Florida 2-year statute of 

limitations? 

MS. MILLETT: My -- the order from the court, my 

understanding, simply denied it on the grounds of legal 

insufficiency, and it didn't give a further explanation. 

It doesn't say what exact grounds was, but if you look to 

what was argued by Florida, they were arguing on 

timeliness. 

Thank you.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. RASHKIND

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. RASHKIND: Thank you, Your Honor. 

If I may begin by correcting what I think are 

two inadvertent mistakes, but important ones. 

Justice Ginsburg, in answer to your question 

about the first State habeas, these are -- these documents 

are contained in -- in your record. They're noted at 

joint appendix 2-5. 

The first State habeas was dismissed because it 

was not notarized. That's the sole basis for its 

dismissal: it was not notarized. 

The second one was brought and denied, and the 

court specifically notes, as we note in the yellow brief, 

footnote 7 on page 12, it set forth the -- the court's 

grounds. It says the motion does not state grounds for 

relief.

 At no point does Florida ever adopt the State's 

position that either of the petitions was untimely. The 

State court addressed them directly on the merits. 

Justice Breyer, if I may, I can actually 

hypothesize several examples under subsection (5), of 

subsection (4), and perhaps even subsection (2) of rule 

60(b), which would be permissible. For example, under 

(5), a judgment that should no longer have continuing

effect might be that the district court entered an 

alternative writ of habeas corpus, tried the defendant 

within 60 days or 90 days, or set him free. And when 

everyone gets back to State court, it becomes plainly 

apparent that can't be done within 60 days, and either the 

State or the defendant might go back and say, please, 

amend that order out of time. It's a final order. Please 

amend it to make it 180 days. 

We can come up with examples, I think, for each 

of the provisions, and I think that's really what's 

interesting about this rule. It is written in a way 

that's durable against AEDPA, and it conforms nicely with 

AEDPA. And it does not take a lot of extra thought, it 

does not take a lot more than adopting the Court's 

previous holdings for us to be able to make it workable 

within AEDPA.

 The fact that this case is now in its 25th year 

is a result of law and not of delay. Mr. Gonzalez alleges 

-- and no one has ever been able to say otherwise because 

we've never had a hearing -- that it took him 13 years to 

find out about the newly discovered evidence. He 

exhausted his claims for 4 years. He was only in Federal 

court for 1 year before the State raised a bar, a statute 

of limitations bar, which turns out to be incorrect. In 

the last 7 years, there's been litigation both in the

court of appeals and now before this Court caused by the 

State's argument that the case should have been dismissed 

on the statute of limitations. 

My client is not responsible for the fact that 

it's the 25th year, but what we do know about this case is 

he has approximately 76 years remaining on his 99-year 

sentence. And unless he gets one bite at the habeas 

apple, he has not gotten what Congress directed he 

receive. Congress made one thing clear in AEDPA, and I 

think it's a good thing, and that is, if a defendant goes 

through and does what he's supposed to do in State court, 

he does not procedurally default the issues, he exhausts 

fully, and he timely files a petition, that was the 

candidate Congress wanted to have to get habeas review. 

In this case Aurelio Gonzalez did all of those 

things, and he sits on the outside, having been told you 

get no bite at the apple, it's too late. And that's just 

plain wrong. And there's something wrong about that, and 

that's why there's rule 60(b). 

60(b) is nothing but a coalescence of many great 

writs that were designed for one purpose and one purpose 

alone and that was to correct mistakes in extraordinary 

circumstances. There can be no more extraordinary 

circumstance than that a person is denied their right to 

habeas review, and that's what's happened here. And we
