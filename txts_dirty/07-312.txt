versus Piccadilly Cafeterias.
 

6  Mr. Makar.
 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT D. MAKAR
 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 

9  MR. MAKAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 

please the Court: 

11  The virtues of reading Congress' grant of 

12 the stamp tax exemption, 1146(c), to only 

13 post-confirmation transfers is threefold. First, it's 

14 faithful to the language of the statute, which requires 

that there be a plan confirmed, as the courts in NVR and 

16 Hechinger have held, and draws a simple bright-line test 

17 at the point of confirmation, at which point the 

18 bankruptcy judge has the power to grant that tax 

19 exemption.

 It's also based upon the principle that 

21 taxation exemption statutes, which this is a case 

22 involving one, must be narrowly construed if they are to 

23 stay under principles of federalism. It also avoids the 

24 intrusion into the State's tax system, keeping in mind 

the important fact that approximately three-quarters of 

3

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 these Chapter 11 cases never get to plan confirmation. 

2 Instead, in three quarters of the cases you have, as in 

3 Lamie and in the Hartford case, you may have a case 

4 convert to Chapter 7 or have it be dismissed.

 So a pre-confirmation tax exemption granted 

6 by the bankruptcy judge at any point prior to 

7 confirmation --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand that. 

9 If it's never confirmed, then I guess the tax is okay, 

isn't it? 

11  MR. MAKAR: Well, Justice Breyer, what 

12 happens in these situations is that a -- for example, a 

13 363 sale order where the property is being sold, in that 

14 order there is an exemption granted by the bankruptcy 

judge. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: But so what? Isn't that --

17 I mean, I assume that's totally illegal, that you get --

18 I thought we're talking about this provision where 

19 everybody agrees that it has to be under a plan 

confirmed under section 1129. So if there's no plan 

21 confirmed, I don't know how you would fall within this 

22 exemption. 

23  MR. MAKAR: Well, that's our point exactly, 

24 Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. If it's your point 

4

1 exactly, then I guess I must agree with that. I'll hear 

2 from the other side. Except I thought your point was it 

3 makes it difference whether the transfer takes place 

4 before the plan is confirmed or after. So I may be just 

confused about that. 

6  MR. MAKAR: Well, what happens in these 

7 situations before confirmation where there is a 363 

8 order that transfers, that the bankruptcy court then 

9 says this is entitled to an exemption, at that point in 

time the State of Florida or whatever State is denied 

11 the revenue that would otherwise --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, I'm asking you 

13 this. You then concede -- let me for my own point of 

14 view; forget what the -- maybe I'm confused about the 

facts or maybe I'm not. But let's suppose there is a 

16 plan and it is confirmed. The transfer, however, took 

17 place a month earlier where a private group of creditors 

18 came together, every creditor, with the debtor and they 

19 worked out a sale tomorrow, and they transferred the 

assets tomorrow. Four months later, the plan that 

21 includes every word of that goes before the bankruptcy 

22 judge, the bankruptcy judge thoroughly understands the 

23 situation, and he says: I confirm the plan. 

24  Now, under those -- in that circumstance, I 

guess you now are -- are you prepared to concede that 

5

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 Florida cannot tax? 

2  MR. MAKAR: No, Your Honor. 

3  JUSTICE BREYER: Of course not. So then --

4 then the fact that there is no plan seems to me 

irrelevant, that situation, from the present case. 

6  So now let's look at this case, where there 

7 is a plan and it is confirmed. My question, going back 

8 to what I thought the facts are, is this: Imagine the 

9 situation I've just described -- thorough investigation 

later by the bankruptcy judge; plan including it is 

11 confirmed. And you say if the transfer took place first 

12 you can assert your tax, but if the transfer took place 

13 second, after the plan, you can't. 

14  And my question, if I'm right on my 

assumption, is I'd like you to provide a reason why any 

16 human being, a reasonable human being, would want to 

17 make that distinction? 

18  Why would anyone want to say we want to give 

19 all the money to the creditors and not let Florida get 

some if it takes place, the transfer, after the 

21 confirmation, but would think differently about it and 

22 would want Florida to get some if the transfer takes 

23 place before the confirmation, which confirmation 

24 describes everything in depth, is thoroughly 

investigated, et cetera? What reason could there be for 

6

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 such a distinction?
 

2  MR. MAKAR: Well, two things,
 

3 Justice Breyer. First of all, the Bankruptcy Code speak
 

4 in terms of a -- 1146(c) speaks in terms of a "plan
 

confirmed." 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not speaking of the 

7 language for the moment. I want you to forget about the 

8 language and assume the language is ambiguous. That's a 

9 different question. My question is, assuming that the 

language is ambiguous, as every lower court has found, 

11 assuming that, however, is there any reason why a 

12 reasonable human being would make this distinction? 

13 That's my question. And there may be an answer, but I 

14 want to know what answer is.

 MR. MAKAR: Sure. In this context --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you could say this 

17 was Congress, right? 

18  MR. MAKAR: I'm sorry? 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: That is not an answer.

 (Laughter.) 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: I would appreciate an 

22 answer to the question. 

23  MR. MAKAR: Well, Justice Breyer, I think 

24 the practical reason is Congress has created a 

structured Bankruptcy Code, in which there is a plan 

7
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 confirmation process structure that Congress has 

2 provided here. And in this particular case, and in 

3 perhaps the hypothetical, this was done outside the plan 

4 confirmation process. In other words, this sale was 

done even before a plan was even filed. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose one of the 

7 reasons would be how far do you go back? I mean, you go 

8 back three years and say, well, you know, the bankruptcy 

9 judge can say, part of what I'm confirming is the sale 

that took place three years ago, so you can file for a 

11 refund, I guess. 

12  MR. MAKAR: Well, that's the fundamental 

13 problem we have. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: That's the problem? If 

that's the problem, I thought that there had to be a 

16 filing for bankruptcy before any of this kicks in. 

17  MR. MAKAR: Well, there certainly is. There 

18 has to be a filing for --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then the answer 

can't be you could go back 50 years. The answer would 

21 have to be you go back until the filing for bankruptcy. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why does there 

23 have to be -- there has to be a filing for bankruptcy 

24 before you get a plan confirmed, but I didn't understand 

that to be the threshold before -- what does that mean, 

8

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 there has to be a filing for bankruptcy? That the 

2 confirmation of the plan can't go back before that? 

3  MR. MAKAR: Well --

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It goes back before 

then in a lot of cases to look for preferential 

6 transfers and things like that. 

7  MR. MAKAR: Well, sure, but here what we 

8 have is the language of the statute, 1146(c), is keyed 

9 in to a key event, which is plan confirmation, the plan 

confirmed. The authority for the bankruptcy judge to 

11 grant the tax --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 

13 answer to Justice Breyer was saying there's another key 

14 event and that's the filing of the petition for 

bankruptcy. 

16  MR. MAKAR: Well, that has -- I don't see 

17 that as having any relevance as to the authority of the 

18 bankruptcy judge to grant the tax exemption. The 

19 question I understood was how far back can can you go? 

And our position on that is opening this up to 

21 pre-confirmation transfers creates all sorts of 

22 problems. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: What? That's what I want 

24 to know. And I'll add a qualification. I'd say I would 

read into this a context, and the context is the whole 

9
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 section that gives the exemption from the State law only 

2 kicks in when you file for bankruptcy. 

3  So, I -- now, it's my question. I guess I 

4 could make the hypothetical the the way I want to make 

it, and the way I want to make it is that this section 

6 applies once it kicks in, the bankruptcy filing, and it 

7 does not distinguish between the pre- and the 

8 post-confirmation, you know, where the confirmation 

9 takes place after the transfer or the transfer after the 

confirmation. 

11  You're arguing to the contrary. And what I 

12 want to know is what reason there is? Do I have to 

13 repeat the question? 

14  MR. MAKAR: No. No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the reason? That's 

16 what I want you to focus on, for making that 

17 distinction. 

18  MR. MAKAR: Well, as I understand the 

19 question, Justice Breyer, you're concerned about the 

pre-confirmation transfer that ultimately gets wrapped 

21 into a plan that's ultimately confirmed and why 

22 shouldn't that be occurring? Our position --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what the whole case 

24 is about.

 MR. MAKAR: Right. And that's the language 

10
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 of the statute in our view provides that the authority 

2 flows from the confirmed plan. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: He wants a reason why that 

4 might be. Do you know many instances in which Congress 

has set up a system in which you cannot determine 

6 whether a State tax is valid or invalid until some 

7 future event at an indeterminate time which may be three 

8 years later? Is that customary --

9  MR. MAKAR: No, in fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for someone not to know 

11 whether the tax is payable or not for sure until three 

12 years later? 

13  MR. MAKAR: No, that's exactly our argument. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that a good reason?

 MR. MAKAR: That's our argument, which is 

16 that it is -- is not narrowly construing the statute. 

17 It's broadly construing it, as the Eleventh Circuit 

18 found --

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's another 

assumption then that was in Justice Breyer's question 

21 about, well, you have to have the petition, the 

22 bankruptcy petition. But in this very case wasn't the 

23 sale -- wasn't the basic arrangement made the day before 

24 the petition was filed?

 MR. MAKAR: Right. This appears to be one 

11
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 of those so-called pre-packaged plans where it was 

2 arranged and was sort of put together outside a formal 

3 plan confirmation process. Under the Bankruptcy Code, 

4 typically there's the filing of the petition --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Absolutely. 

6  MR. MAKAR: -- and filing of the plan --

7  JUSTICE STEVENS: You were asked, and I 

8 think tried to answer and never got your answer out, and 

9 I'd like to hear: What is it you were saying about 

cases in which pre-confirmation transfers are made and 

11 the tax exemption is made? Did you start to tell us 

12 that you might never recover the tax later on? Or what 

13 kind of a problem does it create? 

14  MR. MAKAR: That's precisely my point. In 

three-quarters of these cases approximately, these 

16 exemptions can be given. 

17  JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but then the question 

18 is, can you nevertheless, in an untimely fashion, 

19 eventually get the tax imposed and the tax collected?

 MR. MAKAR: Possibly. If it's in escrow, 

21 possibly. It takes a tremendous amount of monitoring in 

22 these cases. There's a problem with notice. The State 

23 doesn't get notice. 

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there also instances 

-- and, again, I'm interested in Justice Breyer's 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 question and Justice Stevens's question, the practical 

2 reasons that might have prompted the statute to be drawn 

3 in the way that you say it's been drawn. Are there also 

4 instances where a transaction goes through and is later 

unwound, is later set aside? So that the tax has to be 

6 refunded? 

7  MR. MAKAR: Yes. I mean, that could be a 

8 possibility. That's our position, that this is sort of 

9 turning this into a refund statute, perhaps in some 

instances, by allowing all these pre-confirmation 

11 transfers to be eligible for the exemption, keeping in 

12 mind that this whole question in this case is: Are 

13 preconfirmation transfers ever eligible? We don't think 

14 they -- that they are because, as the courts in NVR and 

Hechinger said, the natural, simple, bright-line test is 

16 if you get to plan confirmation, if you've gone through 

17 the process that Congress has established, and you get a 

18 plan confirmed, then the transfer of the security --

19 this is not a securities case -- but the transfer of the 

property has at that point been exempt from the tax. 

21  So in our view, the purpose of the statute 

22 would be thwarted by allowing all these pre-confirmation 

23 exemptions. As I say, in 25 percent of the cases 

24 perhaps you will get the plan confirmed, and perhaps --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I'm not 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 sure I understand the practical consequences of your
 

2 position. I assume that if you're right, people who
 

3 have an interest in buying the bankrupt business will
 

4 wait or have to wait until after confirmation of the
 

plan, because the tax liability is going to save them a 

6 lot of money. Is it going to work in that case? 

7  MR. MAKAR: Work in the sense that --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, will the 

9 effect of your plan be that it will discourage people 

who come along and want to buy a bankrupt business? 

11  MR. MAKAR: No. I think we have to put this 

12 in context. What we have is a Chapter 11 

13 reorganization. And then Chapter 7 of course is 

14 liquidation, which is typically where the assets of the 

company would be liquidated and sold off, and you have a 

16 trustee. Here we have a different context. This 

17 reorganization -- Congress established this 

18 reorganization process. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But are you not -- are 

you questioning -- what I understand to be the case, 

21 it's not at all uncommon for a Chapter 11 these days to 

22 have the 363(b) sale of property, then have some kind of 

23 global settlement, and then distribute all the assets, 

24 never have any kind of reorganization. And I didn't 

understand that it was necessary to kick the case over 

14

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 into Chapter 7. 

2  Aren't there many cases filed under Chapter 

3 11 that end up with no reorganization? 

4  MR. MAKAR: There are a number. There are a 

number. And I'm not sure exactly the number, but it's a 

6 small but growing percentage in which the debtors are 

7 taking advantage of Chapter 11 to liquidate rather than 

8 go through Chapter 7. And there's reasons for that. It 

9 may be that the debtor in possession of the company has 

greater control than a trustee would and so forth. 

11  Our point is that this is -- in this 

12 liquidation context, it's basically trying to hammer a 

13 Chapter 7 peg into a Chapter 11 hole, because what is 

14 happening here is the tax exemption that Congress has 

set up here, which should be narrowly construed in favor 

16 of the State, is being broadly expanded. In fact, what 

17 the Eleventh Circuit did below --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: What harm is done? Could 

19 you tell us in just a few words, what's the harm? 

That's what Justice Breyer's concerned about. 

21  MR. MAKAR: Well, the harm, Justice Scalia, 

22 is that in these instances -- as I said, in cases where 

23 he exemption is being granted unjustifiably, the State 

24 has to expend resources on litigation. And there is now 

a new test, and there has -- it is going back to court, 

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 and there is --

2  JUSTICE BREYER: And it's not the 

3 litigation. What you've said so far is, at least as I 

4 have taken it in, that the practical harm is the 

following: There will be a certain number of transfers 

6 that take place after the filing, but before the actual 

7 confirmation; and in respect to those transfers, the 

8 State is left in a position of uncertainty. 

9  You don't know if you can assert your tax or 

not assert your tax until that transfer is later 

11 confirmed as part of the confirmed plan or not. 

12  That's what I take it as you're having said. 

13 And then I think I'll hear in a minute somebody say, but 

14 that kind of uncertainty is rife in the tax laws. It 

often occurs that a taxing authority is not certain 

16 about how to characterize a transaction until later 

17 events take place which are part of, or related to, the 

18 transaction; and the IRS and all the State tax 

19 departments survive.

 So if I'm right in guessing that, discuss. 

21  (Laughter.) 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: That's all I can say. 

23  MR. MAKAR: The notice provision is one. 

24 The State may not get notice. For example in NVR, 

there's 5,000-and-something transfers of property that 

16

1 happened in the State of Florida that we never get 

2 notice of to object to them. If it is in a 363 context, 

3 we probably don't get notice because we don't own the 

4 property that is being transferred.

 All this pre-confirmation effort and 

6 expenditure of resources on -- the State has to monitor 

7 these --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: What about the solvency of 

9 the person who has tentatively been declared exempt from 

your tax; so, therefore, you can't go get him right 

11 away? This is not the ordinary citizen. This is 

12 somebody who is on the edge of bankruptcy. You would 

13 normally want to get your money out of him as soon as 

14 possible before he squanders what is left, right?

 MR. MAKAR: Well, I --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: And would it -- would it 

17 not happen with some frequency that, even though you 

18 could have collected the tax three years earlier, by the 

19 time it turns out for sure that there's never going to 

be a Chapter 11 confirmation --

21  JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't the tax imposed on 

22 the purchaser, not the bankrupt's estate? 

23  MR. MAKAR: I'm sorry, sir? 

24  JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't the tax imposed on 

the purchaser, rather than the bankrupt's estate?

1  MR. MAKAR: Under -- under Florida law it is 

2 imposed upon the transaction and is repaid by the buyer 

3 or the seller. But on the question here --

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What I don't understand 

about the -- how the Florida system works, I thought you 

6 don't get -- you don't get the transfer recorded until 

7 you pay the tax. I thought that's what Florida law was. 

8  MR. MAKAR: That's correct. But here what 

9 is happening is with the pre-confirmation orders that 

are coming out with regularity, those are being used to 

11 prevent the taxes from being paid and the recordation 

12 of --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Why can't you just say 

14 that? Why can't you say, you want to record this 

taxation, pay the tax. And when you come in later, 

16 because it was confirmed, show us the paper. We'll give 

17 you the money back. 

18  How does that interfere with -- with 

19 anything?

 MR. MAKAR: Well, it becomes an 

21 administrative burden. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Why is it an administrative 

23 burden? The burden is entirely on the people who want 

24 their money back. They come in. They file a piece of 

paper. It says Federal bankruptcy judge signed, plan 

18

1 confirmed, and it would take, I guess, a few minutes to 

2 read through it to see they're telling the truth, which 

3 you always have the problem in a tax, and then you give 

4 them their money back.

 MR. MAKAR: Well, again, what is happening 

6 with these orders being granted, sometimes the State 

7 doesn't even know about it, and sometimes --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, you can't file 

9 it if they don't tell the State. So if they're not 

going to tell you, they're not going to have their 

11 transfer recorded. 

12  I mean, look, we're going into this, and on 

13 the other side, of course, there is the following 

14 consideration: That there are creditors who are owed a 

lot of money; and all these creditors are in a room; and 

16 they think, if I can sell these assets tomorrow, I'm 

17 going to get a lot more money than I will if I have to 

18 wait for six months. That's why we want to go through 

19 with this.

 Now isn't that an important bankruptcy 

21 interest, to make the creditors more whole? 

22  MR. MAKAR: Well, the State of Florida 

23 doesn't want to stand in the way of -- nor do the other 

24 States -- in the way of maximizing the value of the 

estate.

1  And in the situation here we're talking 

2 about a very small tax. It's only imposed in this 

3 limited context as to when a confirmation plan comes out 

4 in Chapter 11.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Makar, you were going 

6 to address, I take it, the assumption that 

7 Justice Breyer has asked you to make, which is that the 

8 language here is ambiguous. And your position is, I 

9 take it, that "confirmed" means "confirmed"?

 MR. MAKAR: Well, absolutely. I don't 

11 concede away our first argument. I think it's very 

12 powerful, which is that the language of the statute, 

13 itself, put in the context of this Chapter 11 

14 confirmation process, read in its context, which is from 

the post-confirmation section, powerfully supports the 

16 position that this is a post-confirmation transfer 

17 exemption. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand 

19 why this is a big deal. Assuming that was news to me, 

that this only arises after the filing of a bankruptcy 

21 petition, and you are looking forward to confirmation of 

22 the plan, this tax only applies at the transfer of 

23 title. 

24  Why don't you just get your deal together 

and just say, well, the closing is going to be the day

1 after confirmation of the bankruptcy plan? 

2  MR. MAKAR: Well -- and then --

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's when you 

4 transfer title, and that's when you have to pay the 

stamp tax.
 

6  MR. MAKAR: Well, that, in the ordinary
 

7 course of things, is what the statute envisions.
 

8 That's, of course, not what happened here, but that's
 

9 the ordinary course. And this exemption --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sometimes don't they want 

11 the transfer to be effective whether or not there is a 

12 later confirmation? I thought that that was the 

13 assumption here: That some of these transfers they want 

14 to be effective whether or not a confirmation occurs 

later. 

16  MR. MAKAR: Well, and that's what happens in 

17 some of these cases that are transferred to Chapter 7 or 

18 dismissed, where they get the tax exemption and then get 

19 out of the Chapter 11 whirl, having gotten the tax 

exemption, leaving the State to have to unravel what has 

21 been done. 

22  That's the beauty and simplicity of the 

23 bright-line rule of Hechinger and NVR, which is that the 

24 language of the statute says post -- it says confirmed 

plan. So it is at that point that the authority of the 

21

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 bankruptcy judge to grant the exemption -- the exemption 

2 exists and, thereby, makes it self-executing in the 

3 sense that the plan is confirmed. The order of 

4 confirmation provides the authority for the exemption; 

and from that point forward it works with -- with 

6 simplicity. It is a very straightforward application of 

7 the statute. 

8  And it's the most natural reading of the 

9 statute, as well. So I don't want the Court to at all 

feel as if I'm conceding ground on the language of the 

11 statute or the structure of the code and how it applies 

12 here. 

13  What I'm -- where I think there may be some 

14 confusion is simply that in these three-quarters of the 

cases these exemptions are being granted, and it is a 

16 problem for the States to have to go out there and to 

17 track them down and figure out what's going on in these 

18 cases and try to unravel the exemption. So it is in 

19 that regard that I -- if one of the exemptions --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask this 

21 question? I guess this has been the rule in Florida for 

22 awhile. There's a problem, and has the problem been 

23 that you actually don't get the money? Or is it an 

24 administrative problem, keeping track of things and 

finding out whether or not you are entitled to it?

1  MR. MAKAR: Justice Stevens, it could be 

2 both. I think it could that be we don't know about it, 

3 so we don't get the money. It gets filed, and then we 

4 don't -- the order is filed with the clerk of court, 

and, therefore, the money isn't received --

6  JUSTICE STEVENS: Are there any studies 

7 showing how much money you've actually lost by this 

8 practice? 

9  MR. MAKAR: No. We've looked at it to see 

if there's any data. There's nothing that I can give to 

11 you with any reliability. I would say, anecdotally, 

12 that it is in the low millions rather than the --

13 obviously the stamp tax in the State of Florida has been 

14 in the billions of dollars overall; but that's not the 

issue here. So -- but it is quite a few millions of 

16 dollars that we believe is --

17  JUSTICE STEVENS: Did I understand you 

18 correctly? You say you have, in fact, lost millions of 

19 dollars from the failure to get access under this rule?

 MR. MAKAR: Anecdotally, yes. As I said, 

21 this is in conversations with the Department of Revenue 

22 and so forth. There's just no hard data. That's one of 

23 the problems in this area, since -- I did provide the 

24 Court with some data about the number of plans that are 

confirmed versus dismissed, and so forth, and the number

1 of filings. We have about a thousand --

2  JUSTICE STEVENS: It would seem to me that, 

3 normally, because you do require recording, that there 

4 would be -- it wouldn't be all that difficult to keep 

track of all these cases in which there had been 

6 transferred pre-confirmation transfers. And if you did 

7 you have some filed in the computer that had them all 

8 there, as soon as the -- if the confirmation did not 

9 occur, you could just go ahead and send out the bills.

 MR. MAKAR: Well, that system does not 

11 exist. I don't know how difficult it would be. I would 

12 suspect -- things sound simple sometimes in theory, and 

13 then in practice they become very difficult in a State 

14 as populous as --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess your point is 

16 that, as a whole, the virtue of the stamp tax is that it 

17 is virtually automatic on recording, and you don't have 

18 to send out notices, and so forth. 

19  MR. MAKAR: Well, absolutely. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The whole point of the 

21 stamp tax. 

22  MR. MAKAR: Absolutely, and it makes it at 

23 that point in time certain. And the virtue, again, of

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How long does it 

2 typically take from the filing of the petition to 

3 confirmation of the bankruptcy plan? 

4  MR. MAKAR: Mr. Chief Justice, the study I 

cited to the Court about the number of cases it could 

6 be -- has data in there. It looks to be -- it 

7 was 4,000, or something along this line. It looks to be 

8 like the average is about -- I think it is around 450 to 

9 600 days. I would have to pull the data and look real 

closely. But that's on average. Some can be very 

11 quick; some can take longer, depending on 

12 the complexity. 

13  A pre-packaged plan like the one we have 

14 before us here, it's not clear here why they couldn't 

have had the plan confirmed before the transfer. This 

16 wasn't a perishable commodity or things along those 

17 lines. But there is not a whole lot of data. 

18  JUSTICE STEVENS: Is it -- another question 

19 I had: Is it not true that even under your rule there 

will be a number of cases that, even though it was clear 

21 that the transaction was after the confirmation, there's 

22 an issue as to whether it was under the plan? 

23  MR. MAKAR: That issue could actually arise; 

24 and that was the Jacoby case that, in our view, sort of 

spawned a lot of the problems here.

1  There may be some issues arising 

2 post-confirmation. We concede that. That -- but that's 

3 going to be less often than if we have the range of 

4 pre-confirmation. Because if we have the range of 

pre-confirmation transfers now being subject to 

6 litigation, it's going to be at least multiples of -- in 

7 terms of the burden on the State. 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I had one question as to 

9 operation of the tax in Florida.

 Suppose a transaction -- there's no 

11 bankruptcy. A transaction is completed. Stamps are 

12 paid. There is then a suit to rescind the transaction 

13 on the ground of fraud or mistake. Do you get your 

14 money back from the stamp tax?

 MR. MAKAR: There is a refund mechanism for 

16 certain situations. I'm not sure if that one would be 

17 covered, but I believe it would be. There are -- there 

18 are some me mechanisms to get a refund back under the 

19 State's systems.

 If there are no further questions, I will 

21 reserve my time for rebuttal. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1  MR. BRUNSTAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

2 please the Court: 

3  The scarcest and most precious commodity in 

4 a Chapter 11 case is cash.  Without cash, you cannot 

even get to confirmation. 

6  The way in which most debtors generate the 

7 cash necessary to get to confirmation, to pay all of the 

8 things that have to be paid in cash on confirmation is 

9 through asset sales.

 In fact, this tax exemption is more 

11 important for pre-confirmation transfers to the 

12 confirmation process than post-confirmation transfers. 

13  Here in this case, if you look at the joint 

14 appendix page 127, you can see the things that had to be 

paid on confirmation of this plan, including 

16 administrative expenses. 

17  In section 1129, Congress set forth the rule 

18 that certain things have to be paid in cash. Every 

19 dollar that is spent to pay a stamp tax cannot be used 

to pay employee claims, cannot be used to pay for goods 

21 and services the debtor desperately needs to reorganize, 

22 and cannot be offered to creditors to get their vote in 

23 favor of the plan. 

24  There is no reason, no reasonable reason why 

Congress would have wanted to allow the exemption for a

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 thousand-dollar transfer that occurs after confirmation, 

2 but not to a ten-million-dollar transfer that occurs 

3 just prior to confirmation. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Because you don't know 

whether that second one will ever be a sale under a 

6 plan, which is what the code requires. It has to be a 

7 transfer under a plan. And when it occurs, you don't 

8 know whether it is going to be an under plan or not. 

9  MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, Justice Scalia, I think 

that depends on how you define the term "under." And, 

11 getting back to your prior question --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: At the time it occurs it 

13 doesn't matter how you define the term. There is no way 

14 at the time it occurs to say that this is a transfer 

under a plan. There hasn't been a confirmed plan. 

16  MR. BRUNSTAD: There has not been a 

17 confirmed plan, but there is often --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: It requires under a plan 

19 confirmed.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, it requires that there 

21 be a plan confirmed. Now, it doesn't say "confirmed 

22 plan." Where Congress intended to foreclose discussion, 

23 it says --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: It says "a plan confirmed." 

How do you know at the time the transfer is made whether 

28

1 it is under a plan confirmed? 

2  MR. BRUNSTAD: You don't necessarily know, 

3 Justice Scalia. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't at all know.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: In fact, you do know, I 

6 presume, on the statistics that the odds are three to 

7 one against there being a confirmed plan. 

8  MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Souter, but that 

9 underscores how difficult it is to confirm plans in 

Chapter 7, why Congress wanted to make it easier by 

11 providing this tax relief. You need cash to confirm. 

12 For example, the administrative expenses --

13  JUSTICE SOUTER: I am -- I don't quite 

14 follow the leap you just made.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, the whole purpose of 

16 1146(a) is tax relief. It is tax relief to provide more 

17 dollars for other Chapter 11 purposes. You cannot 

18 confirm a plan without hard, cold cash. 

19  In the LTD bankruptcy, the administrative 

expenses that had to be paid in full prior to the 

21 effective date of the plan were north of $200 million. 

22 This really makes a difference. This is a live, 

23 flesh-and-blood problem. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought, Mr. Brunstad, 

that the question was asked: So the State is not going 

29
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 to get its tax at the time of the asset transfer, 

2 because the cash is needed to eventually have a plan 

3 that works. So the State doesn't get its tax. 

4  And then it turns out that there is no plan; 

that the case is dismissed. What happens then? Florida 

6 has to get back -- at that point gets the tax that it 

7 wanted up front? 

8  MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Ginsburg, the 

9 practice is to escrow the funds so they will be 

available as an administrative expense if it turns out 

11 there is no confirmed plan. 

12  In addition, this is no different than any 

13 other asset sale in bankruptcy where if the tax 

14 exemption is not allowed, they claim it as an 

administrative expense. 

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: They are all paid up 

17 front, but they are put into escrow. Is that what you 

18 are telling me? 

19  MR. BRUNSTAD: That is the practice, 

Justice Ginsburg. And the reason why Florida is never 

21 harmed is because the procedures are the same whether it 

22 is a Chapter 11 case or Chapter 7. They have to come to 

23 the bankruptcy court and file a request for payment of 

24 this kind of tax anyway.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So there is no case, to

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 your knowledge -- not millions of dollars, but there is 

2 no case, to your knowledge, where, in fact, people 

3 transferred the assets; they thought there would be a 

4 plan confirmed; there was no plan confirmed; and then 

the State was not paid? 

6  MR. BRUNSTAD: None that I'm aware of, 

7 Justice Breyer. And here is why that shouldn't happen. 

8 It is theoretically possible, but here is why that 

9 should not happen.

 Because when the -- a transfer is made under 

11 section 360(c) -- excuse me, 363 -- the transfers are 

12 made free and clear of all claims in interest. That's 

13 what section 363 provides. 

14  If the State wants to get its tax, in the 

ordinary course it comes into the bankruptcy court 

16 anyway, just as Florida did in this case, to file a 

17 request for payment of the tax. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: You would have no reason to 

19 know the answer to that question. You are not the 

State. 

21  The State has told us that millions of 

22 dollars have been lost in taxes not recovered. 

23  MR. BRUNSTAD: That's because the exemption 

24 applies, Justice Scalia. The courts apply this 

exemption in Chapter 11. It is only applied in Chapter 

31

1 11, not Chapter 7. 

2  JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't it odd that the --

3 isn't it odd that the Congress would have required, we 

4 will assume, this escrow procedure when the odds are 

three to one against the non-taxability? 

6  It seems to me that just as matter of simple 

7 efficiency, they would not have required this elaborate 

8 procedure when the odds are that the procedure would be 

9 to no avail to the bankruptcy State -- the State.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Souter, because 

11 the purpose of Chapter 11, as we know, is to facilitate 

12 reorganization, rehabilitation, saving jobs. It is very 

13 difficult. Congress understood it would be difficult. 

14 That's why it made Chapter 11 more liberal than former 

Chapter 10 under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898. That's why 

16 we have this tax relief, to provide more dollars that 

17 are available to make that process actually work. This 

18 is a real flesh-and-blood problem. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it often the 

case -- and I don't know, but is it often the case that 

21 the people who are engaged in one these asset purchases 

22 are, in fact, the creditors themselves? In other words, 

23 they are owed a lot of money and said, well, let's --

24 basically, let's take over the business and run it 

ourselves?

1  MR. BRUNSTAD: Sometimes, Chief Justice 

2 Roberts, but not often. And the reason why we have 

3 these asset sales quickly in bankruptcy, think of the 

4 warehouse of the bananas. If you file bankruptcy, you 

have got to sell those bananas right away. You can't 

6 wait for months and months and months until the plan is 

7 confirmed, because there's nothing left to sell. 

8  Here we have a business which we call the 

9 melting ice cube. It an operating business with 

employees, but we've got to get it into the hands of 

11 somebody with capital quickly. Otherwise, this business 

12 is going to be -- shut its doors. All of those people 

13 will be let go. That's why we had a quick sale here: 

14 To preserve value, to preserve jobs.

 We couldn't wait until the plan-confirmation 

16 process played out. And, in fact, there could not have 

17 been a confirmed plan without the sale because the 

18 creditors were fighting too hard about who was going to 

19 get what. We had to have the sale first, and we had to 

do it quickly to maximize the value, preserve the 

21 business, save the jobs. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I assume that 

23 the creditors have an interest in that as well. I don't 

24 know how -- I mean, they are the ones who could move 

quickly to get the confirmation of the plan, because 

33

1 they are the ones whose interests have to be addressed 

2 before the plan can be confirmed. 

3  So wouldn't they have an interest in the 

4 melting bananas, or whatever?

 (Laughter.) 

6  MR. BRUNSTAD: Chief Justice Roberts, the 

7 answer to that question is that the creditors have 

8 diverse interests. Secure creditors often want to 

9 liquidate quickly. They want to get their collateral 

liquidated because they may be paid in full out of that. 

11 That may leave nothing for the unsecured creditors, the 

12 tort victims, the employees who have wage claims, the 

13 Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. 

14  In order for there to be cash for those 

entities, a more negotiated sale or a different process 

16 might have to be followed. That's what happened in this 

17 case. There was enough to pay the secured creditors in 

18 full and give a 45 to 50 percent distribution to 

19 unsecured creditors, including the Pension Benefit 

Guaranty Corporation. 

21  JUSTICE ALITO: You say the test is whether 

22 it is instrumental. A transfer has to be instrumental 

23 to the plan, is that correct? 

24  MR. BRUNSTAD: That is a standard that we 

offer, Justice Alito. 

34

1  JUSTICE ALITO: That is different from 

2 "necessary"? 

3  MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, it is. It is -- it is 

4 more open.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what does it mean? 

6  MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, basically, Justice 

7 Alito, it encompasses almost any pre-confirmation 

8 transfer. It's a wide open standard. I want to be up 

9 front about that. You could say -- you could use a 

dictionary definition of under in accordance with, it's 

11 about the same. It would cover all of pre-petition --

12 I'm sorry -- the pre-confirmation transfers where you 

13 ultimately have a confirmed plan, because all of them 

14 will be generating cash that make confirmation possible.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand your 

16 arguments about the desirability. How do you squeeze it 

17 into the statutory language? 

18  MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, a couple --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under a plan and 

you're suggesting that it's under the plan before there 

21 is a plan. 

22  MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, the standard -- the 

23 test at 1146(a) requires that there be a plan confirmed 

24 under section 1129. So we have three parts of the 

statute. We have an incident of transfer, that's 

35
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 undisputed. We do in this case have a plan confirmed 

2 under section 1129. And we do, in fact, have a stamp 

3 tax. The question --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: You missed the crucial --

the crucial part. The transfer has to be under a plan 

6 confirmed. I mean, that's the troublesome language. 

7 The transfer has to be under a plan confirmed. 

8  MR. BRUNSTAD: But we know, Justice Scalia, 

9 that in -- where the same language is used, in section 

365(g), it cannot possibly mean post-confirmation 

11 events. It cannot possibly. Because section 365(g) 

12 addresses assumptions or rejections of executory 

13 contracts under a plan confirmed under Chapter 11. That 

14 cannot happen post confirmation because, as this Court 

said properly in Bildisco, assumption or rejection must 

16 occur prior to confirmation of a plan. 

17  So the same language used elsewhere in the 

18 statute, exactly the same, cannot possibly mean 

19 post-confirmation. It must mean something else. And we 

think it means a transfer that occurs either before or 

21 after confirmation as long as you have a confirmed plan. 

22  Now, it's also critical that where Congress 

23 intended to foreclose the debate to require that there 

24 be a plan first, such as in section 1142(b) or section 

511(b), Congress said "under a confirmed plan." You

1 cannot insert a verb between confirmed and plan, where 

2 it's confirmed plan. 

3  In this section, Congress -- in 1146(a), 

4 Congress said plan confirmed under section 1129. Does 

that mean plan that has been confirmed, plan that may be 

6 confirmed, plan that is confirmed? It's ambiguous. 

7 It's ambiguous. 

8  Again, in section 1142(b), Congress 

9 expressly dealt with transfers under a plan -- under a 

confirmed plan. And in context, that distinct language 

11 means there was a plan first, and then it authorizes 

12 parties under the plan to make the transfers that are 

13 authorized under the confirmed plan. 

14  JUSTICE SOUTER: Is it relevant, as your 

friend on the other side pointed out, that the 

16 particular section in question occurs within the statute 

17 under the general heading of "Post-Confirmation 

18 Matters"? 

19  MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Souter. And 

here's why. We know, for example, in section 

21 1145(c)(2), which is also part of subchapter 3, that 

22 expressly applies to an exemption for sales of 

23 securities between the petition date and the 

24 confirmation date.

 In addition, section 1146(b) itself allows

1 for requests for determination of the tax effects of the 

2 plan before the confirmation date. So we know for a 

3 fact that the rules in subpart 3, some of them apply to 

4 pre-confirmation periods, requests, and exemptions.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't the -- isn't the 

6 normal reading, if we're going to give any weight to the 

7 placement in the statute at all -- and I think we're 

8 entitled to give some, that unless there is the kind of 

9 clarity that you've just been describing in these two 

exceptions, that, in fact, the placement there indicates 

11 that it is dealing with a post-confirmation matter? 

12  MR. BRUNSTAD: I think it is entitled to 

13 some weight, Justice Souter, but I think it is 

14 completely undercut by some of the very provisions of 

subchapter 3 by their terms apply to pre-confirmation 

16 events. 

17  Similarly, some the provisions of subchapter 

18 2, section 1127(b) applies expressly to 

19 post-confirmation matters. Congress was not consistent 

in placement -- placing things exclusively under one 

21 heading or another. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Brunstad, there's an 

23 aspect of the way this looks that I don't understand, 

24 and you're an expert in this area. Perhaps you can 

explain it to me.

1  You have one of these 363(b) sales of 

2 property, and then you have a global settlement with the 

3 creditors. What function does the plan serve after you 

4 have all that? The assets have been sold. The 

creditors have made a settlement. There's going to be 

6 no reorganization; whatever there is, is going to be 

7 distributed. 

8  What is the function of having a plan after 

9 all that confirmed? I know one purpose of it is that 

you avoid paying the stamp tax. But is there any other 

11 purpose once you have already settled that the sale is 

12 made, the creditors agree on how it's going to 

13 be divided up? What is the function that the plan 

14 serves?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: That's an excellent question, 

16 Justice Ginsburg. The answer is, I think, important. 

17 And there is an excellent answer, and that is, whereas 

18 Chapter 7 liquidations are sort of off-the-rack, Chapter 

19 11 liquidations are custom-made. The plan is 

custom-made and tailored to the particular assets and 

21 circumstances of the particular case. 

22  The assets that were sold in this case was 

23 not all the assets to be sold, Justice Ginsburg. That 

24 often happens. And this plan provides for the orderly 

liquidation in a specific way of the assets that 

39

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 weren't, in fact, sold. 

2  There also are all kinds of claims that have 

3 to be resolved and dealt with. This plan, in a 

4 customized way, dealt with with the resolution of those 

claims -- the PBGC liabilities, tort liabilities, all 

6 different kinds of liabilities and concerns -- in a much 

7 more efficient and tailor-made way than could have 

8 happened if the case had been converted to an 

9 off-the-rack Chapter 7 case.

 There is a test which the lawyers and the 

11 courts apply as to whether we should stay in Chapter 11 

12 when the situation has been that most of the assets have 

13 been sold or whether we should convert to Chapter 7, and 

14 that is whether it's in the best interests of the 

creditors and the best interests of the estate to stay 

16 in the Chapter 11. 

17  That test was met here. It was clearly in 

18 the best interest to stay in the Chapter 11, because we 

19 got that customized procedure: A plan administrator who 

was appointed subsequently who is continuing to 

21 liquidate assets and distribute the proceeds. We have 

22 all kinds of benefits. 

23  Now, it is not possible to confirm a Chapter 

24 11 plan simply to escape tax liabilities. Section 1129 

says you cannot confirm a plan if the primary purpose is 

40
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 to escape tax liabilities. So there is a protection for 

2 the State there as well. 

3  Here, of course, the primary purpose of 

4 confirming the plan was not just to he avoid tax 

liabilities. It was to do all these other 

6 administrative things in a custom-made way. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the section you 

8 mentioned earlier that uses "under" in a sense that 

9 clearly applies to pre-confirmation?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Section 365(g), 

11 Justice Scalia. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm looking for it, and I 

13 can't --

14  MR. BRUNSTAD: We quote it in part on page 

38 of our brief. And it is quoted in part on page 17 of 

16 the Petitioner's brief. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Did you make that argument 

18 there? 

19  MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes. Yes, Justice Scalia. 

On pages 38 and -- 37, 38, and 39, we specifically talk 

21 about section 365(g)(1), and we cite the Bildisco case 

22 and specifically made the point --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: How does that provision 

24 read? Do you have it quoted here?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: I do, Justice Scalia. Let me 

41
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 quote it for you exactly. Section 365(g) deals with 

2 what the effect of a rejection -- I'm sorry -- effect of 

3 breaching an executory contract is. And there are two 

4 subparts, 365(g)(1), which provides: "If such contract 

or lease has not been assumed under this section or" --

6 here's the language that is the same -- "under a plan 

7 confirmed under Chapter 11." 

8  So, if the contract or lease has not been 

9 assumed or -- under this section, section 365, or under 

a plan confirmed under Chapter 11, then the breach is 

11 basically deemed to have existed just immediately prior 

12 to the filing of the bankruptcy case. 

13  It is exactly the same language. And it is 

14 also in (g)(2), the same language is used yet again.

 It cannot be the case that the election to 

16 assume or reject an executory contract can occur 

17 post-confirmation. It cannot. Why? Because, as this 

18 Court explained in Bildisco, the assumption or rejection 

19 must occur prior to confirmation, up until the point of 

confirmation, is the language this Court used. The 

21 lower court decision, the TWA case, et cetera, all say 

22 exactly the same thing. And there's an important reason 

23 for that. 

24  The standard for assumption or rejection, 

even if it is elected in a plan, is you have to satisfy 

42
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 section 365. And that has to be done through a court 

2 order, through a court proceeding that has to occur 

3 essentially before the court actually confirms the plan. 

4  So the same language used --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why? Why? 

6  MR. BRUNSTAD: Because the debtor has to 

7 elect -- the debtor has to make a decision before 

8 confirmation so we know what's going to happen to the 

9 property, and so the creditor can timely final a claim 

if it is going to be rejection, because the creditor 

11 does not file a claim for rejection damages for 

12 rejection of the contract until the assumption or 

13 rejection is determined. That particular thing is 

14 postponed.

 But we must know that prior to confirmation 

16 because we have to know how to treat the creditor's 

17 claim; if we have to pay that creditor significant 

18 money, what's going to happen to the property. For 

19 example, Justice Souter, suppose it is a contract to 

purchase a Boeing 767 for $600 million. The debtor 

21 might file for bankruptcy, one of the airlines files for 

22 bankruptcy and might have to decide whether to honor 

23 that obligation or to reject that obligation, assume it 

24 or reject. We need to have that information. We need 

to know if the debtor is going to have to pay that $600 

43

1 million before confirmation. We can't wait until after 

2 because it's too important to the plan. It's too 

3 important in dealing with the asset. 

4  That's why all the courts, including this 

one, have said you must make the assumption-or-rejection 

6 election up until confirmation, never after. So it 

7 can't be the case that the specific language "under a 

8 plan confirmed under Chapter 11" as used in section 365 

9 refers to post-confirmation, but that is in fact the 

same language used in section 1146. 

11  Now, contrast that with the language used in 

12 sections 1142(b) or 511(b), which talks about a 

13 "confirmed plan." And, in context, that language 

14 clearly means a plan comes first. Congress could have 

used that same formulation in section 1146(a); it chose 

16 not to. And under Russello and the other precedents of 

17 this Court's canons of construction, we should give that 

18 semantic choice its deference. And, again, there's a 

19 reason. So a statute --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your argument there 

21 is that "under a plan confirmed" means something 

22 different than "under a confirmed plan"? 

23  MR. BRUNSTAD: In context, yes, Chief 

24 Justice Roberts. And if you look at section 1142(b), I 

think you can -- you can actually see in context why 

44

5

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 that so clearly means -- that so clearly means the plan 

2 comes first and then is confirmed. But again, it's 

3 different language that is used. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- do you 

agree with the proposition that you only go back so far 

6 as the filing of the petition? Well, what in your 

7 argument suggests that that's a logical stopping point? 

8 It seems to me that if you don't take the date of 

9 confirmation, I don't know why all of your policy 

arguments wouldn't cause you to go back further. 

11  MR. BRUNSTAD: By statute, Chief Justice 

12 Roberts, section 103 provides that the provisions of 

13 Chapter 11, in Chapter 11, including section 1146, apply 

14 only in a Chapter 11 case. There is no case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but we've 

16 already shown a willingness to abandon that type of 

17 limitation with "under a plan confirmed." So, you know, 

18 the consideration of the prior transfer is going to take 

19 place in the context of a bankruptcy case.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: The only sections that apply 

21 basically to pre-bankruptcy, pre-petition matters, are 

22 the avoidance powers in section, for example, the 

23 preference actions in section 547, the fraudulent 

24 transfer provisions in section 548. Those things 

expressly apply to pre-bankruptcy events, and they say,

1 before the -- "90 days before the commencement of the 

2 case," those kinds of things. When Congress wanted to 

3 reach back before the petition date, it used very 

4 specific terms of the art, very specific authorization.

 Nothing like that appears anywhere in 

6 section 1146(a), and for good reason. It's very clear, 

7 and every court to have looked at this has so held, that 

8 1146(a) does not apply before the case is commenced. 

9 And that makes sense because the purpose is to give tax 

relief to facilitate the Chapter 11 process. You want 

11 to have cash available --

12  JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just ask this. As 

13 a practical matter does the judge, the bankruptcy judge, 

14 enter some kind of an order approving the transfer, even 

though it's pre-confirmation, an order to establish the 

16 tax exemption? 

17  MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Stevens. In 

18 fact, that has to happen. 

19  JUSTICE STEVENS: So it would have to be 

after the filing of the bankruptcy proceeding. 

21  MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Stevens, it 

22 must. And under section 363, the Bankruptcy Court must 

23 approve sales like this on notice to creditors, which 

24 would include the State. And here, in fact, what 

happened is consistent with what happens in almost every 

46

1 bankruptcy case. Because the State has an interest, a 

2 taxing interest, in the transfer, the State will get 

3 notice, which Florida gave here. They have an 

4 opportunity to come and object if they wish to, which 

they did here. 

6  There are actually more protections for the 

7 State for pre-confirmation transfers than 

8 post-confirmation transfers. After the confirmation of 

9 the plan, the Bankruptcy Court's work is essentially 

done, and then you're just out in the world under the 

11 plan and the debtor is making sales and transfers. 

12 There isn't the opportunity for the State to come in and 

13 actually object to things as there is pre-confirmation. 

14  So here the State actually has more 

protections for the pre-confirmation sale --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you know 

17 whether to pay the tax or not? I mean, you know that 

18 the bankruptcy petition has been filed, but you really 

19 don't know whether there's going to be a plan confirmed 

under Chapter 11. How do you know whether to pay or 

21 not? 

22  MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, for example --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I assume there are 

24 penalties if you don't pay on time.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: There's a very practical 

47

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 reason for that question, Chief Justice Roberts, and 

2 that is in this case the Bankruptcy Court specifically 

3 determined in his order, judge in his order, that the 

4 exemption would apply. So that was determined in the 

order. Of course --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But this doesn't 

7 happen for some time down the road, right? 

8  MR. BRUNSTAD: Well --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Up to, I guess -- we 

were told up to 400 days. 

11  MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, you can't have a sale 

12 until the Bankruptcy Court approves it. In the process 

13 of approval, the Bankruptcy Court was asked and made the 

14 determination that 1146(a) would apply. Now, what 

happens then is the State can come in and has the right 

16 to file a request for payment of administrative expense 

17 and the funds are escrowed, because if in fact there 

18 ends up not being a confirmed Chapter 11 plan, then the 

19 State is entitled to its tax, and the money is then paid 

to the State, its request for payment of administrative 

21 expenses is allowed, and it gets is money. But this can 

22 make --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's always escrowed? Is 

24 that --

MR. BRUNSTAD: It's not always escrowed,

1 Justice Scalia. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a uniform practice? 

3  MR. BRUNSTAD: That is the practice, but 

4 it's not uniform because in some cases there's no need 

for an escrow. There are some cases in which we know 

6 there's going to be enough cash available that the State 

7 will be paid, so we don't need that safety. But the 

8 State can always ask for it, and if the State asks for 

9 it I'm almost certain in most cases it will get it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it relevant that this is 

11 a tax-exemption provision? 

12  MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, I think it's relevant 

13 in the sense that Congress was clearly intending here to 

14 grant tax relief to Chapter 11 debtors to facilitate the 

Chapter 11 process. It's not a tax exemption, Justice 

16 Alito, in the sense of, for example, an exemption to a 

17 revenue-raising provision. In other words, you could 

18 have a State statute that says: The purpose of the 

19 statute is to raise taxes and we'll create exemptions. 

That's one context. And there it might make sense to 

21 say: Well, look, while the overall purpose of the 

22 statute is to raise revenue, we might construe the 

23 exceptions to that purpose narrowly. 

24  Here the purpose of Chapter 11 is to 

facilitate the Chapter 11 process. So I think we

1 construe this revenue-raising -- I'm sorry -- this tax 

2 relief measure consistent with that overall purpose. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why shouldn't we look to 

4 see how it was in the Internal Revenue Code with respect 

to the Federal State tax exemption? That I think leaves 

6 no room for argument. This case might be argued either 

7 way about does it apply to preconfirmed plan asset 

8 transfers? But as I understand it, this section 4382(b) 

9 was limited to post-confirmation transfers, that is 

transfers made within five years after confirmation of 

11 the plan. 

12  MR. BRUNSTAD: That's the limitation that 

13 the United States wanted to add to section 267 of the 

14 Bankruptcy Act of 1898. Congress did not grant the 

United States' request. The United States said this is 

16 administratively too difficult to administer, and 

17 Congress rejected that testimony from the representative 

18 of the Treasury and enacted section 267 over the 

19 objection of the United States.

 Now, the United States after the Excise Tax 

21 Reduction Act, I think of 1965, does not really have 

22 many excise taxes. And so the testimony of the 

23 Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Code -- Revenue 

24 Service in 1978, when the Bankruptcy Code was being 

adopted, was that the United States doesn't really care

 MR. BRUNSTAD: That one I'm not certain of, 

16 Justice Ginsburg. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that said that 

18 the tax exemption was limited to transfers 

19 post-confirmation.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Ginsburg. There 

21 the three -- the history of the development of the 

22 statute is section 77(b)(F) and then went to section 267 

23 and then went to section 1146. That's the direct --

1 the State, and it's at page 17, mentions the 

2 now-repealed 4382(b). 

3  MR. BRUNSTAD: That may, Justice Ginsburg, 

4 have been a mirror provision. Before 1938, the 

tax-exemption provisions under the Bankruptcy Code were 

6 mirrored. There was a provision in the Bankruptcy Act 

7 in section 77(b)(F). There were also mirroring 

8 provisions under the bankruptcy -- under the Internal 

9 Revenue Code. Those were eliminated and instead we just 

have section 267 under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, which 

11 dealt with the exemption in bankruptcy. 

12  Justice Ginsburg, I think that, going back 

13 to your earlier point, I think it's important to 

14 underscore that the context of this case is different 

from other contexts in which the discussion of how we 

16 should construe a tax exemption applies. I think the 

17 Court here should apply the analysis that it applied in 

18 Dolan, where the Court was considering application of a 

19 similar canon of narrow construction, and the Court 

said: Well, in construing the Federal Tort Claims Act, 

21 in juxtaposition to this concept that we construe 

22 waivers of sovereign immunity narrowly, we don't apply 

23 that because that would basically run afoul of the 

24 purpose of the Federal Tort Claims Act provisions.

 The same thing here. The proper rule of

1 resolution where we have an ambiguous statute is to look 

2 to the purpose of the statute, and the purpose here is 

3 to make Chapter 11 easier by granting tax relief. And I 

4 think that, consistent with that purpose, the Court 

should construe section 1146(a) --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I? 

7  MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Scalia? 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, we've said in 

9 other opinions no -- no statute pursues its purposes at 

all costs. And the limitations contained in a statute 

11 are as much a part of its purpose as the broad purpose 

12 that you just mentioned. I mean, if a -- if a "plan 

13 confirmed" means a plan confirmed, that limitation is 

14 part of the purpose no less than the broad purpose that 

you express. 

16  MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, that -- that's true in 

17 general, Justice Scalia, but if Congress had really 

18 wanted to narrow the purpose here to post-confirmation, 

19 it would have surely used the temporal limitations it 

used, for example in section 1127, where the Court said 

21 before -- the Congress said before confirmation you do 

22 this; after confirmation you do that. That is a -- that 

23 is a standard legislative technique used throughout the 

24 Bankruptcy Code that was not used in section 8.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe, but "under a plan

4 the Court stated in Ardestani, quote, "The word 'under' 

has many dictionary definitions, and we must draw its 

6 meaning from its context," close quote. And under 

7 Robinson, the Court looked to, where there was an 

8 ambiguous statute, the purpose as the way to resolve the 

9 ambiguity, and I submit that should happen here.

 MR. MAKAR: This provision 365(g) says the

13 not under a section under a plan. What that means is 

14 that it's deemed rejected if, at the time of plan 

confirmation -- not before, but at the time of plan 

16 confirmation. If it's not in the plan, it's deemed a 

17 rejection, rejected. That's merely a -- an instrument 

18 to say when the contract is -- is deemed rejected. If 

19 it's in the plan it's not rejected. If it's not in the 

plan -- it doesn't get --

1 is in a different context, which is saying that the 

2 rejection is -- constitutes a breach but gas not been 

3 assumed, and at that point it has not been assumed, but 

4 at the point of confirmation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I can understand -- just 

6 taking a quick look at 365(g), why it serves a different 

7 purpose and a different function. 

8  But the Respondent's point was, you have to 

9 interpret "under" differently under your view, under 

365, than under the statute at issue. 

11  Do you agree with that? 

12  MR. MAKAR: No. No. Because under a plan 

13 confirmed in 365(g) relates to point of confirmation or 

14 beyond, and we believe under 1146(c) or under 1146(a, 

Congress has readopted it. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your argument is 

17 that you don't have a rejection of the executory conduct 

18 -- contract -- until the plan is confirmed? That's 

19 what Congress --

MR. MAKAR: That's what -- I'm sorry yes. 

21 That's -- at that point. That doesn't undermine the 

22 argument that under a plan confirmed, 1146(c) means at 

23 the point of confirmation or beyond. 

24  The most natural reading of 1146(c) is to 

provide this post-confirmation transfer exemption. No

1 one is contesting that. That's the natural reading of 

2 the -- of the statute. 

3  And the point here of there being more 

4 protection and, for example, is simply not the case. 

The State is not on notice ob many of these transfers as 

6 an MVR. Those were transfers that were outside the 

7 ordinary course of business. We would give not notice 

8 of that. And in the ordinary course of 363 practice, 

9 parties that have an interest in the property -- the 

State doesn't- -- do not get notice of that proceeding. 

11 So that -- this notion that there's more protection in 

12 pre-confirmation than post-confirmation is just 

13 unsupportable. 

14  In -- in conclusion, Your Honors, this is a 

tax exemption statute, and under this Court's principles 

16 it should be narrowly construed. It shouldn't be 

17 expanded to this pre-confirmation transfers with all the 

18 problems it creates, in the three quarters of cases that 

19 don't get confirmed, and have all these intrusions upon 

them, but -- local governments in their collection of 

21 the stamp tax. For that reason we ask the Eleventh 

22 Circuit be reversed. Thank you. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

24 The case is submitted.
