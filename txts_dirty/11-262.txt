CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 11-262, Reichle v. Howards. 

Mr. Gallagher. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN R. GALLAGHER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. GALLAGHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

The issue before the Court today is whether 

Secret Service agents who are prepared to take a bullet 

for the Vice President must also be prepared to take a 

retaliatory arrest lawsuit, even when they have probable 

cause to make an arrest. Respondent in this case seeks 

personal money damages against two U.S. Secret Service 

agents who arrested him, allegedly with a retaliatory 

motive, after he lied to them about whether he touched 

Vice President Cheney. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: There's just a little bit 

of noise in the courtroom, and I'm -- I have a little 

bit of difficulty hearing your very opening statement. 

MR. GALLAGHER: Sure. 

The Respondent in this case seeks personal 

money damages against three -- against two --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Yes.

MR. GALLAGHER: -- U.S. Secret Service 

agents who arrested him, allegedly with a retaliatory 

motive, after he lied to them about whether he touched 

Vice President Cheney. There are three reasons why 

these agents should not be held personally liable. 

First, the absence of probable cause should 

be a required element of a retaliatory arrest claim. 

Thus, this Court is called upon to answer the question 

that it left open in Hartman v. Moore. 

Second, U.S. Secret Service agents acting in 

their protective capacity should be entitled to a 

qualified immunity when they make an arrest with 

probable cause. Indeed, to view it any other way would 

be to subject Secret Service agents to the potential of 

retaliatory arrest claims based upon a mere allegation 

of retaliatory animus, something this Court has 

steadfastly refused to do, and for good reason: Because 

retaliatory animus is easy to allege and hard to 

disprove. 

And, third, regardless of whether this Court 

decides to extend the Hartman rule, the law in 2006, at 

the time of the arrest was not clearly established, thus 

entitling the agents to qualified immunity.

understand --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the probable 

cause? What was the probable cause for the arrest? 

MR. GALLAGHER: Justice Ginsburg, the Tenth 

Circuit found that the probable cause that -- that 

underlies its opinion was a 10001 -- a 1001 violation, 

lying to a Federal agent. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Explain that to me. 

That's a false statement to a government officer, but 

that's not the reason -- 1001 wasn't the reason that 

these officers had to arrest. They -- there was a 

question of assaulting the Vice President, and I think 

that the charge that eventually was made in the State 

court was harassment. So, there's no indication that 

these officers had 1001 anywhere in their minds. 

MR. GALLAGHER: Well, two points, Justice 

Ginsburg: First of all, under Devenpeck, officers are 

not required to give all of the reasons behind an 

arrest. But, second, and I think perhaps more 

importantly in this case, when Agent Reichle contacted 

Mr. Howards and made the arrest, Mr. Howards had lied to 

him. That was relevant to a Secret Service agent's 

assessment of the risk of the situation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do they have to give -- at 

least when you stop a car, the test is whether there was

probable cause, not whether that was the reason that the 

officer stopped the car. 

MR. GALLAGHER: That's correct, 

Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: There was a broken 

taillight. There existed probable cause, whether that 

was the basis on which he acted or not. Now -- is it 

any different when --

MR. GALLAGHER: I don't think it's any 

different --

JUSTICE SCALIA: With respect to an arrest? 

MR. GALLAGHER: Yes, with respect to an 

arrest. This is – 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So long as they have good 

reason for an arrest, it doesn't matter. 

MR. GALLAGHER: Absolutely. That's an 

objective --

JUSTICE BREYER: That -- we've never held 

that in respect to a claim that the real reason the 

police arrested was retaliation against, for example, a 

picket sign having an unpopular point of view or a 

statement having an unpopular point of view. That is, 

this Court has never held that it overcomes an arrest 

where there's a claim of retaliatory First Amendment 

action; is that right?

MR. GALLAGHER: That's right, and --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And what you're 

saying is your first reason is that we should say that. 

And the -- the question I wanted to ask you there is, 

you make a very strong case where the President and Vice 

President are involved, the need to protect them, but 

the rule that you there adopt is a rule that will apply 

to every police officer, anyone who arrests anyone 

anywhere in the country, and no matter how clear it is 

that the motive was retaliation against a point of view, 

that individual will be protected from a Bivens action. 

So, it sounds as if your first claim -- the 

remedy sweeps well beyond the need that you sketch. And 

so, I'd like your response to that. 

MR. GALLAGHER: Justice Breyer, I think it 

has to do with the determination in the Tenth Circuit 

and the fact that the -- the Tenth Circuit's decision to 

extend Devenpeck to these facts was not the subject of a 

cross-appeal. So, the issue that you -- you posit is 

not an issue that's before the Court. It was --

JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. I'm 

just saying if I agree with you on your first that if 

there is a probable cause for an arrest, then wouldn't I 

have to say there is no retaliatory First Amendment 

claim when a border officer chases into Arizona a person

with whom he politically disagrees, and there are 14 

bishops who will say he cared about nothing but his 

political disagreement? And there's nothing to the 

contrary, and he says: Oh, I happened to notice -- at 

trial -- that when he left he reached out and snatched a 

$5 bill that was in the till. And so, I had probable 

cause to arrest him. 

End of case. Now, that sounds very 

far-reaching, and I don't know that I'm prepared to do 

that. So, therefore, is there another way you might win 

your case, or should I do that? 

MR. GALLAGHER: Well, let me answer both of 

those questions. What you've outlined is essentially 

footnote 10 from the Hartman case. That's the footnote 

that says what do you do if the -- if the person that 

initiated the prosecution says, I did it for a -- a 

retaliatory reason? And the Court side-stepped that 

issue. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MR. GALLAGHER: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And, of course, Hartman 

dealt with prosecutions. But people all the time don't 

arrest others. Policemen frequently don't arrest people 

for everything they might arrest them for. I mean 

jaywalking, to take an example. Or all kinds of

things where they just normally don't arrest somebody. 

You might -- or I'm sure you didn't, but I might 

sometimes have driven 60 miles an hour in a 55-mile 

zone. And I shouldn't even admit this. I hope I get 

away with it. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: But -- but you see, it's 

different arrests and prosecutions. 

MR. GALLAGHER: Well, I – it certainly, 

it's different, but the Devenpeck standard --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it different? You --

you acknowledge that prosecutors always prosecute, that 

they never exercise discretion and say, oh, what the 

heck, you know? 

MR. GALLAGHER: Certainly, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: All the time. All the 

time. I don't know that it's any less frequent than --

than an officer deciding not to arrest. 

MR. GALLAGHER: And Justice --

Justice Breyer, I think that the difficulty with your 

hypothetical is, especially with regard to Secret 

Service agents, who perform -- when they're engaging in 

their protective functions, they're essentially --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's exactly what 

Justice Breyer is saying. Okay? Which is, as I 

understand it -- and there's some literature that talks 

about should we be treating misdemeanor arrests 

different than felony arrests, because there's less 

discretion that an officer would have with respect to 

arresting someone for a felony than for misdemeanors or 

criminal fines, because like jaywalking, policemen don't 

arrest you for jaywalking unless they're either on a 

ticket binge or because there's something about you that 

they don't like. 

MR. GALLAGHER: Sure. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, if that something 

about you they don't like is that you're wearing an 

antiwar armband, are we going to let that plaintiff not 

recover, because somehow we need to protect police 

officers so much, in the discretionary use of this vast 

power they have to arrest that we're going to permit 

them to trample the First Amendment, essentially? 

Or are we going to say, in the normal 

situation there is a First Amendment claim, even with 

probable cause, if you can prove that it's the 

motivating factor for the arrest; but we treat Secret 

Service differently? 

And I think that was the point

Justice Breyer's getting to, and the one I'm most 

interested in. 

MR. GALLAGHER: Okay. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we don't extend. 

Hartman, how do we in a principled way deal with the 

unique needs of the Secret Service? 

MR. GALLAGHER: Let me -- let me briefly 

address the first half of the question, and then I'll 

address the second half. The first half, when --

Justice Sotomayor, when you suggest that police officers 

could trample on the First Amendment, it's important to 

remember we still have probable cause as the -- as the 

principal picture here. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you're jaywalking, 

there's probable cause. 

MR. GALLAGHER: But probable cause is the 

Fourth Amendment standard specified by the Framers of 

the Constitution. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but what does it 

have to do with violating the First Amendment? Meaning, 

if police officers have discretion and they would not 

otherwise arrest you except for their dislike of your 

speech, that's a violation of your right to free speech, 

isn't it? 

MR. GALLAGHER: Well, I'm not sure that that

is exactly the case. Again it gets back to this 

footnote 10 in Hartman, which -- which, there -- Hartman 

can be read two different ways. It can be read as 

saying that the elements of the constitutional tort 

itself require the absence of probable cause, or it can 

be read as saying the elements of the cause of action. 

But let me -- let me address the second question. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We can go to that 

question later. 

MR. GALLAGHER: Yes. And the second 

question has to do with Secret Service agents, because 

Secret Service agents, unlike police officers performing 

law enforcement functions, when Secret Service agents are 

acting in a protective capacity, they are protecting our 

Nation's leaders and they are doing so in a very public 

way, and they are also doing so in a way that is 

essentially a free speech zone. 

Virtually everyone that a Secret Service 

agent encounters when he's protecting the President or 

the Vice President can allege that they're engaged in 

free speech. So, for Secret Service agents in 

particular, they -- they can legitimately evaluate what 

someone is saying in order to determine a particular 

threat level. And because of that, Secret Service 

agents have a similar sort of complexity of causation to

the -- the situation addressed in the Hartman case. 

Now, in Hartman, clearly it was a one -- it 

was a two-individual causation situation, but with 

regard to Secret Service agents, the causation is 

similarly complex because Secret Service agents can 

legitimately take into account what someone is saying in 

order to determine a threat level. 

Regardless of whether the Court decides to 

extend the Hartman case, it's absolutely clear that the 

law in 2006, in June of 2006 when the agents made this 

arrest, was not clearly established. The Hartman case 

was handed down in early 2006. It had only been on the 

books about 3 months when the arrest was made. For that 

reason, Secret Service agents should be entitled to a 

qualified immunity in this case because the law was not 

clearly established. 

With regard to the -- the formulation of 

qualified immunity that we are asking for, we believe 

that it is important for Secret Service agents acting in 

this protective capacity to have the requisite breathing 

room in order to make decisions in life-or-death or 

imminent-threat situations. In fact, the qualified 

immunity that we're advocating is particularly important 

at the margins, particularly important in situations 

where it's not clear what a Secret Service agent can do

or should do, where a Secret Service agent has to make a 

snap decision in order to determine whether someone's a 

threat and then act appropriately. 

The Court in the Atwater case noted that the 

object of -- of the Court's cases has been to draw 

standards sufficiently clear and simple to be applied 

with a fair prospect of surviving judicial 

second-guessing, months and even years after the -- the 

arrests are made. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're not suggesting 

absolute immunity? 

MR. GALLAGHER: No, we are suggesting a 

qualified immunity that's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's a different kind 

of qualified immunity? 

MR. GALLAGHER: It's certainly different 

from the Harlow type of qualified immunity. It is an 

immunity that is contingent upon having -- contingent 

upon the Secret Service agent being -- acting in a 

protective capacity and having probable cause to make 

the arrest. But, certainly, once the immunity attaches, 

it would be -- it would be full immunity from a claim. 

The Court noted earlier this term, in 

Ryburn v. Huff case, that judges should be cautious 

about second-guessing a police officer's assessment made

on the scene of the danger presented by a particular 

situation. We think that this case aptly demonstrates a 

situation in which Secret Service agents made very --

very difficult decisions on the spot, and they should 

not be second-guessed by the Court. 

Finally, with regard to the -- whether 

qualified immunity is -- was clearly established in June 

of 2006, the Ninth Circuit -- the primary case relied 

upon by the Tenth Circuit was the Skoog case. The Skoog 

case was the case that the Tenth Circuit relied upon in 

holding that Hartman should not be extended. 

It's important, though, when you review the 

Skoog case to -- to read the entire case, because the 

Skoog court, after concluding that -- that Hartman 

should not be extended, still proceeded with the 

qualified immunity analysis to determine whether the law 

was clearly established at the time of the incident. 

And what the Skoog case concluded was -- it looked at --

it looked at the nature of the right. 

And, you know, we know from the 

Anderson v. Creighton case that this Court has said it's 

important when focusing on constitutional rights not to 

look at the 30,000-foot level, not to look at the high 

level, but to look at the contours of the right. And 

that's what the Skoog case did.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

I'd like to start off addressing the Secret 

Service in particular because that's the principal 

focus, although I take the point that there are 

questions about applying the rule in a broader context. 

But I think understanding why the rule makes sense in 

the context of Secret Service agents and law enforcement 

officers who are performing similar protective functions 

would help inform why it makes sense to broaden the rule 

as well. What the Secret Service --

I'll pick up on the point that Petitioners' 

counsel was making, which is that it's legitimate in 

this context for Secret Service agents to take into 

account expressive activity in determining whether the 

circumstances warrant a discretionary exercise of the 

power to arrest. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I assume you would 

include U.S. marshals?

MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: F.B.I. agents? So, 

you're talking about protective details. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct. And that's 

why I wouldn't limit it to the Secret Service in 

particular. I think what happens in a lot of these 

contexts is that it's natural for these individuals to 

encounter First Amendment activity by the public, and 

it's legitimate for them to react to First Amendment 

activity in deciding whether the circumstances warrant 

an arrest. 

And the problem arises because it's very 

difficult to distinguish between, on one hand, a 

legitimate consideration of expressive activity as 

evidencing the sort of threat that warrants a response 

from an illegitimate consideration of expressive 

activity borne of a motive to suppress a viewpoint. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does your rule apply 

regardless of the degree of animus that the agent is 

alleged to have had as to the particular view being 

expressed? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: I think it would, 

Justice Kennedy, because we would have an 

across-the-board, no-probable-cause requirement of the 

kind that the Court applied in the retaliatory

prosecution context in Hartman. 

Now, I think your -- the question of the 

degree of animus asserted by the agent on the scene is 

exactly why these are complicated factual questions. 

Those kinds of allegations can be made, and then you're 

going to have a trial where the agent is on the stand, 

and the jury is going to have a very difficult time, and 

the agent is going to have a difficult time explaining 

why it is that he acted legitimately based on expressive 

activity because he felt that there was a threat to the 

person he was trying to protect, as opposed to 

explaining that he didn't act in order to suppress the 

viewpoint that was being asserted. 

These kinds of allegations can often be 

made. And, in fact, they can even be manufactured at 

the scene by an intelligent person who's going to be the 

subject of an arrest. And I think that complicated 

question of causation is exactly why it makes sense to 

apply in this context the same objective screening in 

the form of a no-probable-cause requirement in Hartman 

to this context of retaliatory arrest. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is there any difference 

if -- when ordinary policemen are policing an authorized 

demonstration --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- in front of this Court 

or anywhere for that matter? The people making the 

demonstration have -- have the same motivation and can 

make the same assertion of, oh, the only reason you 

arrested me was because you didn't like what I was --

what I was talking about. So, why should that situation 

be different? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct, 

Justice Scalia, and that was going to be my next point. 

Once we understand why it is that it makes sense to 

apply this rule in the context of officers who engage in 

this sort of critical public protective functions of the 

Secret Service, I think we understand why it also makes 

sense to apply it in other situations, because law 

enforcement can legitimately take into account 

expressive activity when they're engaged in functions 

such as crowd control. 

And in those contexts as well, it's going to 

be difficult to disaggregate the legitimate 

consideration of expressive activity as evidencing a 

threat --

JUSTICE BREYER: Illegitimate? You just --

MR. SRINIVASAN: -- from an illegitimate 

desire to suppress a viewpoint. Sorry.

JUSTICE BREYER: Do you want -- do you want 

the same rule of automatic, you know, immunity -- it's

unfortunately, but how far do you extend it? You say 

extend it to everything. To jaywalking, to 

persecutions, to, you know -- that's what's making me a

MR. SRINIVASAN: Right, and I can understand 

the basis for the nervousness. I guess the question for 

the Court is whether the benefits of having an 

administrable across-the-board rule outweigh the costs 

of trying to forge some sort exceptions to deal with 

extreme hypotheticals. And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have a sense of

those jurisdictions that permit them -- I know they're

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And with what frequency? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: We've done an unscientific 

search, but to use the same time frame of reference that 

the Court used in Hartman, which is looking back 

25 years, if you do a sort of standard Westlaw search, 

what you'll see is there's roughly a hundred court of 

appeals cases and 450 or so district court cases

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's -- a non-felony. 

I'm sure it's in the millions. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: It's -- the -- I'm sure 

there are scores and scores of arrests. That's correct. 

And, of course, all we're talking about is the cases 

that get to the point where you have an opinion that can 

be -- that can be found. And there's the obvious point 

that, depending on what the Court does here, you may see 

a proliferation of -- of those claims. And we certainly 

hope that wouldn't be the case. 

But I think on -- in -- on the question of 

whether it makes sense to have an across-the-board rule, 

I guess I would echo what Petitioners' counsel was 

suggesting, which is you can have the same set of 

considerations in the retaliatory prosecution context 

because prosecutors do act with -- by hypothesis, with 

illicit motives in some situations. 

And the Court considered whether the 

benefits of having an across-the-board rule outweigh the 

costs of forging an exception to deal with extreme 

circumstances. And what the Court said was: We want to 

have a rule that's designed to deal with the mine run of

cases; we don't want to have a rule that has an 

exceptional-circumstances exception because in that --

at that point, there will be a great deal of litigation 

concerning what cases fit within of the exception and 

what cases don't. 

And what the Court said was that's rather 

like designing a retirement plan to deal with the 

possibility that someone might win the lottery. That's 

in footnote 10 of Hartman. And I think similar 

considerations would weigh -- counsel in favor of 

applying an across-the-board objective, 

no-probable-cause screen in this context as well. And I 

think it's important to understand that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though this -- I 

think in Hartman, Justice Souter gave two specific 

reasons, neither of which apply in this context. I 

mean, this is -- it's the prosecutor who institutes the 

charges, but the suit is not against the prosecutor, who 

would be absolutely immune. So, that is not in this 

picture. Here we have one officer. 

So, it would certainly be an extension of 

Hartman because the reason that Hartman gave for the 

rule was tied to -- very much tied to prosecution rather 

than arrest. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I -- with respect,

Justice Ginsburg, I think this case is of a piece with 

Hartman in two relevant respects. Your Honor is quite 

correct that Justice Souter's opinion focused on the 

fact that you have two individuals in play. You can 

have that situation here, but we don't base it on that. 

What the opinion was getting to was that 

that creates complex issues of causation in the 

prosecution context. And I think it was the complex 

causation that really drove the need to have an 

objective across-the-board rule. 

You have the same kind of complex causation 

problem here, for the reasons that I've explained, which 

is that it's extremely difficult to disentangle a 

legitimate desire to act -- to suppress danger, of which 

speech is evidence, from an illegitimate desire to 

suppress a viewpoint. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You might apply the same 

immunity for selective enforcement based on race? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: The same immunity? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: No. The -- they -- I think 

the Court's decision in Whren, for example, supposes 

that even though you have probable cause, you can have 

an equal protection claim if the proof could be made --

and this is very important. In the equal protection

context, including for race, there is a different 

objective screen in place, and it's a stringent 

objective screen that this Court announced in Armstrong, 

which is that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm aware of the 

reservation in Whren. Why should there be a difference 

in the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection and First 

Amendment speech? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think part -- part 

of the reason is this, that in -- with the First 

Amendment, expressive activity can legitimately be taken 

into account precisely because it can manifest a danger, 

whereas with race in the ordinary case, I think the 

reason why we have these principles in the race context 

is it's ordinarily not a relevant consideration. 

And the Armstrong rule is designed to 

distinguish between circumstances in -- in which race 

was the motivation and in which race wasn't the 

motivation. And it serves that purpose well. But it 

doesn't work so well in this context, because here First 

Amendment activity can legitimately be taken into 

account; when, as in this case, a Secret Service agent 

overhears an individual say that he's going to ask the 

Vice President how many babies he's killed, it makes all 

the sense in the world for the Secret Service to focus

their attention on that person. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what about for 

crowd control? You want to extend it to crowd control 

as well. What difference does the First Amendment make 

there? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think it's -- the 

nature, intensity, and vehemence with which the First 

Amendment activity is being engaged in can inform an 

officer on whether the circumstances present the kind of 

danger that warrants a law enforcement response. 

So, I -- and when a law enforcement officer 

does that, he's going to be subject to potential 

liability if an individual says: Look, you weren't 

reacting against me because of the way I was expressing 

my views; you were acting -- reacting against me because 

you disagree with my views and you wanted to suppress 

them. 

And that's a very hard thing to disentangle. 

And it not only has that problem at the back end, but it 

results in a problem at the front end as well, because 

what happens at the front end is that officers at the 

very outer margins might have in the back of their mind 

a concern that if they acted based on their best 

intuitions about what kind of law enforcement response 

is warranted, they might later be subject to suit based

So, I can't give you an answer one way -- one way or the 

other. 

I did want to make one additional point, 

Justice Ginsburg, in response to the question you posed 

about the applicability of Hartman, which is that at one 

level it applies, the rule should apply, because the 

same concern with complex causation is at issue here at 

well -- as well. 

But the other way to think about the 

applicability of Hartman is to -- is to put these cases 

on a spectrum. On one end, you have what the Court in 

Hartman identified as a standard retaliation case, of 

which the Court identified public employment as the 

archetypal example. And on the other end, you have 

retaliatory prosecution, where the Court thought that 

there were sufficient concerns about complicated 

causation that it made sense to have an across-the-board 

objective rule.

Now, the question could be where does 

retaliatory arrest fit within that spectrum? Is it on 

the retaliatory prosecution side or is it on the public 

employment side? And for a couple of reasons, I think 

it fits decidedly within the retaliatory prosecution 

side. 

One is the one I've given, which is that 

speech can legitimately be taken into account. And so, 

it creates complex causation. But the other one is in 

some sense the flip side of that, which is that in the 

-- in public employment context, the standard fact 

pattern is going to involve a long-term relationship 

between an employer and an employee, during which time 

there's been no adverse action; the employee then 

engages in some sort of expressive activity, in the 

aftermath of which the employer undertakes some adverse 

action such as a termination. 

Now, in that context it makes sense to infer 

that there may well be an illegitimate speech --

speech-suppressive motivation at work, because you have 

in some sense a control period in the interactions 

between the employer and the employee that pre-dated the 

expressive activity. 

That's not the case when you're dealing with 

law enforcement. In the law enforcement context in the

main, this is a one-time interaction between an officer 

and a suspect, the arrestee. You don't have the prior 

relationship that acts as a control. And so, you have 

to ask the question whether, based on that one-time 

relationship, is there a basis for inferring that a 

speech-suppressive motivation was at work? 

And here, because it can be legitimate for 

an officer to take into account speech in deciding 

whether this situation is the kind of one in which a law 

enforcement response is warranted, it makes sense, 

unlike in the public employment context, to apply the 

same objective across-the-board screen in the form of a 

no-probable-cause requirement that you have in 

prosecutions. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I go back to the 

probable cause, the question I asked before? It's not 

like the taillight. 1001 came up in court. I -- this 

situation may well have warranted probable cause for 

assault, probable cause for harassment. But where did 

-- but the 1001 was not the -- was in no one's mind. It 

does seem quite strange. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: It was not, Your Honor. Of 

course, that's exactly what happens in the Fourth 

Amendment context. That's -- that was the issue before 

the Court in Devenpeck, and the Court explained in

Devenpeck why it makes sense to have an objective 

probable cause inquiry rather than a subjective one. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But doesn't it matter 

that it's something that comes up only in court; it's 

not something that -- I mean, why wasn't the natural --

well, one would expect probable cause to arrest because 

it was an assault or harassment -- the actual charges 

that were made? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't know the reason 

that a -- I don't know the precise contours of the 

harassment charges in State court that were made. I 

think that they mapped on in some measure to the 

assault, the assault that was suspected by the -- by 

Officer Reichle, who effected the arrest. 

Now, I think the concern with importing some 

sort of subjective probable cause dimension into the 

inquiry -- if you asked, you know, what offense did the 

officer in fact have in mind, it's the same concerns 

that drove the Court to apply an objective rule in 

Devenpeck, including, for example, that you would have 

dis-uniformity, in that similarly situated individuals 

would be treated differently based purely on what 

happens to have been in an officer's mind. 

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. LANE 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. LANE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

I think what we have here is a solution 

being offered by the Government, and now we have to go 

find the problem. And I think that's what 

Justice Breyer's question was directed at here. 

I have done, not a scientific search, but I 

can take credit for a little bit of science involved in 

determining how many such cases arise. And at page 13 

of our brief, we cite in footnote 8 that a search with 

no time limitations whatsoever going back in LEXIS with 

the words "Bivens" or "1983," "retaliatory arrest," not 

limited to protective details, shows 15 reported Federal 

appellate cases, with no time limitations whatsoever. 

So, we have a solution, but we really don't 

have a problem. The only Secret Service case that this 

Court has ever heard that I'm aware of involving 

anything remotely like this is Hunter v. Bryant. So, 

this is not a significant problem. 

This also factually is probably not the best 

case for them to be making their argument that we need 

some sort of special rules that apply to the Secret

Service, given the facts of this case, where Mr. Howards

him on the back, telling him what a great job he's 

doing.

bag, right?

said your policies are disgusting, that person touches

We have got to look into the subjective mind 

of the agent. That's where Justice Ginsburg's questions

violation. 

The agents on scene in deposition said we 

arrested him because of the way he approached the Vice 

President -- not a crime -- and his demeanor. We

a State charge of harassment.  Nobody ever said 1001

were you doing? And the whole country is in mourning.

MR. LANE: Correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: We understand that. And, 

therefore, it's a matter of concern that the -- if you 

have a rule of law that says to the agents, when you 

hear someone who says how many babies are you going to 

kill that day, I'm going to ask the Vice President, I'm 

going to touch him, I am going to then tell them a lie 

when they ask me if I touched him -- that's cause for 

concern. 

MR. LANE: Absolutely. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, if there's a 

lawsuit, the agency will say we just can't do it. We 

can't do it. We can't use that as a basis for stopping 

that individual. 

MR. LANE: Well, that --

JUSTICE BREYER: All that poses a problem. 

Now, you're -- and I -- I think -- I recognize it as 

a problem. I'm not saying I have the solution. 

MR. LANE: Well, I think you hit on the 

solution as part of the problem you just expressed, and 

that is, can they stop this individual? And the answer 

is "absolutely yes." They have every arrow in their 

quiver, under Terry v. Ohio. They can stop him if they 

perceive a threat. They can force him to open up his 

opaque bag. They can force him to show them what's in

They can wand him with a metal-detecting wand. They can

JUSTICE SCALIA: And it wouldn't be a 

violation of the First Amendment if they only did that 

because they didn't like the ideas he was expressing? 

MR. LANE: They are allowed --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wouldn't that be a 

violation of the First Amendment? 

MR. LANE: They are allowed to take 

reasonable steps under Terry, under every conceivable 

case that this Court's ever decided. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though they're doing 

it for -- they do it for a racial reason, would that be 

okay? 

MR. LANE: No. No. What I'm saying --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course not. I don't see 

how your -- your First Amendment exception doesn't apply 

to those things as well as to --

MR. LANE: It would. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to the arrest. 

MR. LANE: It would. If he could prove that

speech and it was motivated -- and I know this -- Your

But if he could prove that the Terry stop 

was motivated by -- in an effort to punish him for his 

free speech, yes, that would be a cause of action as 

well. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what you have, 

under your theory, a person should put on his car a 

bumper sticker that says "I hate the police" and then 

every time they're pulled over, they will have --

certainly a plausible case is you violated my First 

Amendment rights. It's not because I was going 60 miles 

an hour; it's because of my bumper sticker. 

MR. LANE: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the police 

officer -- at that point, he says, you know, I can't 

give a ticket to this guy without being hauled into 

court on personal liability because he's got a credible 

case that it was for First Amendment grounds. 

MR. LANE: Well, I think we can look at 

the -- as I've said, the arrows in the quiver of the 

Court to weed out those kinds of cases. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. You've 

already got the officer in court. I mean, you get a 

speeding ticket, and most times they don't show up 

because they have got other things to do. Now he's got

MR. LANE: Well, I mean, litigious 

plaintiffs are a consistent problem across the board 

under many contexts. And there's really -- you know, 

there's almost nothing that can be done. This Court has 

taken steps to cut back prison litigation that's 

frivolous, things of that nature. 

But, yes, if -- the heightened pleading 

standard this Court enunciated in Iqbal: You can't just 

come up with conclusory allegations. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Well, 

this --

MR. LANE: You have to have facts in support 

that that's why they stopped me, because of my bumper 

sticker. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that -- is that a 

case that you could state?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He pulled me over, 

he gave me a speeding ticket, but the only reason he 

picked me out is because I had a bumper sticker saying

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why doesn't it go to 

trial? And -- well, does it go -- I mean, do you get 

depose the police officer? You know, why did you stop 

him? Did you stop anybody else for going 65 miles an 

hour that day? 

MR. LANE: Well, I mean, these evidentiary 

questions have to be first of all supported in a 

pleading with heightened scrutiny under Iqbal. 

Conclusions are not simply enough. You have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a conclusion. I 

mean, if -- if he didn't have the bumper sticker and you 

asserted in the pleading he stopped me because he knows 

I hate the police, that's a conclusion. But if you have 

the bumper sticker, he says, you know, I had the bumper 

sticker, and that's why he stopped me. 

MR. LANE: Well, let me give the flip side 

of that and say if the police officer did stop him 

because of the bumper sticker, he should go to trial. 

He should be held accountable for that. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, the only way you 

can find out is you put in the evidence -- here's the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then all of a 

sudden -- I don't know why everybody doesn't have a 

bumper sticker. 

MR. LANE: Theoretically, every single 

person who has ever been arrested for any crime could 

raise a first amendment retaliation lawsuit. Every 

convicted murderer doing time throughout this country 

could do that. They don't, however. There is -- there 

is not a rush to the courthouse of retaliatory arrest 

claims because the pleading requirements are heightened. 

Qualified immunity for over a hundred years has 

protected the Secret Service. They've been protecting 

the executive branch --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, say, though, that in 

the case of the President, what you're hearing is, as 

you well know, that the combination of disparate 

political views and risk is unlike other situations. 

And I don't know if they can prove it or you could prove 

the contrary, but that's -- that's a claim. And I can't 

say there's nothing to it.

So, let me suggest to you another arrow 

which – I’ll ask you what you think of this arrow, and 

the answer's going to be not much, but I'm interested 

in hearing --

MR. LANE: Go ahead. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- your reason. 

MR. LANE: I'm ready. 

JUSTICE BREYER: In -- in Hartman, Justice 

Ginsburg and I dissent. 

MR. LANE: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And we referred to a D.C. 

Circuit case. And in the D.C. Circuit, it said -- it 

talked about rare cases "where strong motive evidence 

combines with weak probable cause to support a finding 

that the prosecution would not have occurred but for 

the ... animus." Now, so far, you think "fine." 

But suppose you were to say because of the 

factors that have just been mentioned where the 

President's at stake, the courts -- where his life is at 

stake, the President's -- the courts will not infer once 

probable cause exists that it's weak. And the courts 

will not infer from the simple presence of political 

disagreement that the motive of retaliation is strong, 

which in fact would produce a very limited extension of 

Hartman to the case of protecting the President of the

And now, I know you're not going to agree 

with that, and I'm trying it out and I'm not saying I 

agree with it, but I want to see what you -- how you 

react. 

MR. LANE: Well, let's take a look at the 

facts of this case. The Tenth Circuit found there was 

probable cause for a 1001 violation. But was there 

probable cause -- is there a great body of 

circumstantial evidence surrounding this case that would 

point to probable cause which should be considered in 

deciding how this case proceeds? We have the agent in 

charge of the protective detail, Agent Lee, standing 8 

inches away from Vice President Cheney when this entire 

encounter occurs. Agent Lee testified he saw no crime 

committed. We had numerous agents --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. 

MR. LANE: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's go past that for a 

second. What was it that the arresting agent said or 

did that showed the animus? Meaning, because that 

another officer actually saw it and understood himself 

what he thought doesn't mean that this agent who was 

told that there had been a touching had that 

information.

MR. LANE: The evidence --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, I know collective 

knowledge is a theory in a lot of cases, but let's deal 

with the facts of this case. What's the animus? 

MR. LANE: Well, there were discrete First 

Amendment episodes that occurred in the context of this 

case. One was testified to by Mr. Howards in his 

deposition, that when he first of all was approached by 

Agent Reichle, Agent Reichle said, "I want to talk to 

you," and flashed his badge, and Mr. Howards declined 

the invitation to talk to Agent Reichle. That, 

according to Mr. Howards, angered Agent Reichle. That 

is a First Amendment significant event in and of itself. 

Steve Howards testified that he then was 

asked by Agent Reichle: We want to talk to you about 

assaulting the Vice President. And his response was: I 

didn't assault the Vice President; I merely criticized 

his policies in Iraq, and if you don't want him 

criticized publicly he should stay in his undisclosed 

location. Or words to that effect. 

Again, Mr. Howards testified that angered 

Agent Reichle. At that point, the cuffs went on. And I 

think that is circumstantial evidence in support of the 

animus for what -- what was going on. Agent Reichle was 

on notice as to what Howards had said to the Vice

President --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How does all of that 

prove your point of animus in light of the undisputed 

fact that he lied about touching the Vice President? 

MR. LANE: Well, again --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that's the --

MR. LANE: -- lying to the Vice President is 

what we look at on a Fourth Amendment analysis, because 

what's in Reichle's actual mind under Devenpeck is 

irrelevant. So, yes, there was probable cause, but was 

Reichle himself directing his animus at Mr. Howards and 

arrested him? We have to look into what was actually in 

his mind, and that was not in his mind. A 1001 

violation was not in his mind. We looked -- what was in 

his mind? And we've already said what was in his mind 

is he approached the Vice President, he criticized him 

publicly --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You do understand that 

this case is inviting the questions the Chief Justice 

asked, which -- and which -- as Justice Breyer and some 

of us are concerned about, which is what your adversary 

has described as First Amendment voicing is going to be 

a part of many, many arrests.

outside of the one that you proposed by your 

adversaries, that probable cause is the line? 

MR. LANE: Well, that line --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That doesn't enmesh the 

police in a constant barrage of claims that just because 

they angered a police officer, that's why they were 

arrested. 

MR. LANE: Well, first of all, there has not 

been this constant barrage. Hartman has only applied 

until -- I mean, this Court decided Hartman in 2006 for 

retaliatory prosecutions. There has not been a run on 

the courthouse on retaliatory arrests --

JUSTICE ALITO: Would you --

MR. LANE: -- either before Hartman or 

after. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Would you acknowledge that 

the Secret Service faces a different situation from 

ordinary police officers in conducting their daily 

activities, in that Secret Service agents may 

legitimately take into account First Amendment activity 

by someone who is in the vicinity of the President or 

the Vice President in assessing the degree of danger the 

person presents? 

MR. LANE: This may not help my case, but 

I'll go further than that and I'll say any police

officer has an absolute right to listen to what any 

protester is saying and consider what is being said in 

terms of assessing the level of threat that that 

protester poses. 

But as I said in this case, they had every 

right to stop Mr. Howards, to do a Terry stop on him, 

because they were concerned about him. And reasonable 

cause for concern under Terry is the standard. You 

don't need probable cause to pat someone down under 

Terry. It's simply if a reasonable officer would be 

concerned. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Again, I don't understand 

why you -- why you say that they're immune from the 

charge of First Amendment retaliation for that but not 

immune from the charge of First Amendment -- I mean --

MR. LANE: I'm not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If you say they're doing it 

on First Amendment grounds for the one, they're doing it 

on the First Amendment grounds for the other. Why is 

either one okay? 

MR. LANE: I'm not saying that they're 

immune on a Terry pat down if it's done in retaliation 

for free speech. I'm simply saying that would make it a 

much more difficult case for any protester to go to a --

to go to court and say the only reason he patted me down

Amendment analysis and not the Fourth Amendment analysis 

at this point. First Amendment analysis --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they didn't 

arrest him -- they didn't arrest until after he lied, 

right? 

MR. LANE: But it was never in their minds. 

They testified. That didn't have anything to do -- that 

is the Tenth Circuit's post hoc rationale under 

Devenbeck, which -- Devenpeck -- which says you -- if 

there's any objective probable cause that the Tenth 

Circuit or this Court or any other court can concoct, 

post hoc, even though it wasn't in the officer's mind, 

that's good enough to arrest somebody. That's -- that 

probable cause. All right? 

But in First Amendment analysis, it can't be 

an objective standard. There -- objective standards are 

clean, they are nice, they -- they create bright lines. 

But when we are looking at a First Amendment violation, 

we have to got to be able to get into subjective intent 

of the officer at -- on the scene. 

JUSTICE ALITO: And when you say that, that 

means that almost all of these cases have to go to

JUSTICE ALITO: I engaged in First Amendment

standard, where -- and, in fact, in Butz, this Court 

held that a firm application of rules of civil procedure 

will always prevent frivolous claims and meritless 

litigation from occurring in situations exactly like 

this. And that's true. A firm application of the rules

this Court has decided some incredibly difficulty cases. 

Snyder v. Phelps, authored by Your Honor, very difficult 

case. Could it be side-stepped, by -- you know, 

somebody steps off a curb and is thereby jaywalking? 

Are we limiting --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One thing about your 

analysis that concerns me is that you seem to have a 

very black-and-white view of what's going on in the 

officer's mind: Did you stop -- did you arrest him 

because of retaliation or was it because of legitimate 

security? 

And I suspect that the people engaged in 

this type of thing have intuition. I mean, they don't 

sit there and say, well, let's see; is it because he 

says he didn't like the war in Iraq, or is because he's 

wandering around, looks like he's looking for something, 

with a -- with a bag? I mean, I assume they sort have 

experience and they calculate all this in and say I've 

got to do something. And how do you parse those 

different motivations? 

MR. LANE: Well, what I say about that 

is that -- and, again, I know this is not an answer that 

you're probably going to like, because this means a 

trial is involved, but this is what juries do on a daily 

basis throughout this country, in every criminal case.

What is the subjective intent of the defendant? In 

every civil case, is this an intentional act, a knowing 

act, a reckless act, a negligent act? That's what 

juries do. 

And if there's enough evidence to get this 

case to trial -- and I would posit it that in this case, 

where you have agent after agent after agent who saw the 

encounter up close and personal with the Vice President 

and Mr. Howards, none of whom saw any evidence of any 

criminal activity by Mr. Howards, all of whom let Mr. 

Howards walk away from the scene, that's good evidence 

that --

in fact, don't like the answer is because what the agent 

is now going to have to factor -- in addition to the 

hostility of the views, the touching of the Vice 

President, the lying about it, the wandering around with 

the bag -- is in the back of his mind, you know, if I'm 

wrong, I may be held personally liable in damages for 

taking some action that some jury somewhere is going to 

say was based on retaliation rather than my obligation 

to protect the Vice President. 

MR. LANE: Well, I mean, theoretically yes, 

that could be a problem. And I am quite certain that 

certain civil litigants -- just as in criminal cases,

people are wrongly accused of things that they didn't 

do, they end up in a trial, and sometimes juries get the 

wrong results and an injustice occurs. 

We can't fix all those problems when it's 

not really a significant problem. There are no run on 

the courtrooms around the land of these kinds of cases 

arising. We don't need to have any rules that 

specifically pertain to the Secret Service when, to my 

knowledge, this Court has had one Secret Service case in 

its entire history, and there are 15 appellate reported 

Federal decisions regarding retaliatory arrests, 

period --

JUSTICE ALITO: Which -- is there a record 

of retaliatory arrests by Secret Service agents against 

people who say things that are critical of the President 

and the Vice President? 

MR. LANE: The only way I know to look for 

that is on Westlaw or LEXIS. And Mr. Srinivasan 

indicated that they found 100 or 400 cases. We did a 

search like that. We came up with the same number. We 

dug down into those cases. And in terms of actual 

litigated retaliatory arrest cases, we found 15 total. 

That's not scientific, but that's the best I've got for 

you at this point. 

And I don't know if there is a repository of

where we can find that or not. But this -- and I 

started this argument by saying this is a solution in 

search of a problem. The Secret Service has adequately 

done their jobs beautifully over -- for over a century. 

And there is no reason to put some different rule down 

on the Secret Service. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we lost a couple of 

Presidents, didn't we? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. LANE: Well, they're doing the best they 

can. I mean, that's -- I understand that. But it is --

it is a serious, serious issue to curtail the First 

Amendment. 

Consider the situation where you actually 

do -- and I believe this is that case -- you have Secret 

Service agents who deserve to be taken to a trial 

because they have gone out of their way to punish 

someone for their free speech. 

What do you do about those guys? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's ambivalent. I 

mean, suppose it turns out you have this trial. We know 

what words were spoken. Get to the trial; it turns out 

Reichle is a strong opponent of the war in Vietnam. 

Then, end of trial, right? 

MR. LANE: You know, that would be a fact to

be considered by the jury. I could lose this trial when 

we go back, if we get a trial. That's what -- that's 

what jury trials are all about, Justice Ginsburg. 

And I'm not saying that I have to show 

evidence to this Court that I'm going to win the trial 

before I win this case. The issue simply is, can we 

sacrifice the First Amendment? You know, does a 

litterbug lose their right to have First Amendment free 

speech, does a jaywalker lose their right to have First 

Amendment free speech because probable cause exists to 

believe they've committed some offense? And you'll have 

officers ostensibly enforcing litter laws and jaywalking 

laws and blocking-the-sidewalk laws, and First Amendment 

is essentially evaded. 

A hundred years of jurisprudence, courageous 

jurisprudence, many times by this Court, goes by the 

boards because somebody is a litterbug. I just don't 

see that as the solution to this problem, and I also 

don't see that the Secret Service needs some enhanced 

protection from this Court when this has never been and 

is not now any kind of a serious problem. 

The status quo is Mount Healthy. It has 

worked for decades, and it should continue to work. And 

if these agents get tagged in this case, maybe they 

deserved to get tagged in this case, because the First

Amendment is extremely important. And I don't denigrate 

the job of law enforcement or these agents in any way. 

I'm simply saying that when the First 

Amendment is at stake, I think -- and the law has been 

working just fine throughout decades, to extend the no 

probable cause in Hartman to on-street encounters where 

there is no complex causation chain, where the main 

actor in Hartman was immune completely from lawsuit --

the prosecutor in Hartman could not be sued under any 

circumstances, nor could the prosecutor in Hartman be 

questioned in deposition under our traditions. We don't 

question prosecutors in depositions about why they made 

decisions to go ahead and prosecute. So, this Court 

stepped back in Hartman and said that's a different 

story. 

But on-street encounters -- if you extend 

the no-probable-cause requirement to on-street 

encounters, any rogue police officer, or Secret Service 

agent, who wants to can ostensibly enforce any number of 

legal violations -- 1 mile an hour over the speed limit, 

you're going to jail allegedly for going 1 mile an hour 

over the speed limit; or under Atwater, for not wearing 

a seat belt -- when the real reason is your bumper 

sticker. 

If you can prove that, they should go to
