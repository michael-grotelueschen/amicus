(11:14 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear 

argument next in Case 08-1569, United States v. O'Brien. 

Mr. Horwich. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN HORWICH 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. HORWICH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Section 924(c)(1) starts by defining a 

single crime of using or carrying a firearm during and 

in relation to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking 

crime. 

Next, it addresses sentencing, and it does 

that by giving the judge some rules to channel his 

discretion in particular cases, and among those is a 

requirement that a, quote, “person convicted of a 

violation” … “shall be sentenced” to a greater minimum 

sentence when the firearm is of a particular type. 

And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well wait. There’s --

there’s some sentencing stuff in -- in the first part 

as well. There’s sentencing stuff in (A). You can't 

say that (A) deals only with elements and (B) deals 

with sentencing.

MR. HORWICH: Well, no, and, of course --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, (A) says, "shall be 

sentenced to 5 years." Or to 7 years, or to 10 years. 

So there’s sentencing stuff in (A). 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I agree with you that 

the phrase "be sentenced" certainly appears in (A) as 

well. To the extent a statute is going to direct a 

particular sentence, it’s going to use those words. 

But I think the -- we’re relying a lot 

more on the language in the beginning of subparagraph (B), 

that says, "if the firearm possessed by a person convicted 

of a violation," which necessarily presupposes, then, that 

there has been a conviction --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So does -- so does the language 

of (A)(ii) and (A)(iii), which is the same language: “if 

the firearm is brandished”; “if the firearm is 

discharged” -- they all apply to a conviction for carrying 

the firearm. There has to be a conviction before those 

things apply. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I agree. That's true. 

That is certainly an accurate statement --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So that makes (A) the same 

as (B). And -- and you don't claim that the elements in (A) 

are just sentencing elements, do you? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I certainly don't claim

that they -- that the elements in the principal 

paragraph of (A) are. The point I’m -- the point I'm 

trying to make is that, with respect to firearm type, 

which is at issue here, is that the firearm type 

provisions are introduced by specific language that 

says -- that tells the reader these are relevant to a 

person convicted of a violation; these are not relevant 

to whether --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but you’re 

forgetting the words of this subsection. I mean --

MR. HORWICH: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the subsection would be 

(B) itself. If you're convicted of carrying a machinegun, 

you get -- I'm sorry -- a short-barrel rifle, et cetera, 

you get 10 years. If it's a machinegun, you get 30. 

What's -- what's irrational about reading 

the statute that way when it uses the word "subsection"? 

It didn't use "subparagraph." 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I agree it doesn't use 

"subparagraph." And "subsection" certainly in 

conventional use in drafting would refer actually to 

924(c) as a whole. 

But -- but looking to the word "this 

subsection," Justice Sotomayor, is not -- is not useful 

for distinguishing among the elements and the sentencing

factors, because of course there are, I think --

certainly this Court's holding in Harris says that the 

brandishing and the discharge provisions are sentencing 

factors. They are part of this subsection. 

All the courts of appeals have held, and 

it's the entirely natural inference of the recidivism 

provisions in subparagraph (C), which is also part of 

this subsection, are -- are themselves sentencing 

factors. So saying that something is in this subsection 

means that it might be part of a violation doesn't 

actually answer what is or is not part of the violation 

versus --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But still and all, if -- if 

Congress were being precise and if the statute is to be 

read the way you suggest, the introduction to capital 

(B) should have been "if the firearm possessed by a 

person convicted of a violation of paragraph (A) above," 

and then pick it up, "is," so forth. 

Right? I mean, that would -- would be more 

precise. 

MR. HORWICH: That -- that I think would be so 

precise that we wouldn't be here discussing it today. I 

agree with that. 

But, of course, Congress has also used that 

same reference to “subsection” throughout -- throughout the

entire statute, even if it's not being used in the most 

precise sense, in the sense that a violation of this 

subsection appears in subparagraph (C), it appears in 

subparagraph (D), which is not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MR. HORWICH: -- which is not then to say that 

this subsection -- that everything in this subsection is an 

element. The Court has held otherwise already. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess I agree with you 

that if (B) is -- if (B) is an element, (C) would be an 

element, too. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, that certainly would be 

the inference. And that would be quite contrary to the 

traditional treatment of recidivism. 

But, more generally, the tradition that 

Congress is working within in this new statute -- which, 

I want to point out, is significantly different in -- in 

a very substantive way from the old statute -- that the 

new statute proscribes a statutory maximum of life in 

all cases. That is different from the old statute. The 

old statute --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is this to do -- I 

mean, the obvious question, to me, is -- since I wrote 

the -- I think I wrote the opinion in Castillo -- is we 

looked at the language of the statute, very similar to

this, and we said: Machinegun means a separate crime. 

And they recodified it. And it looks to me as if all 

they did was take the things that we previously said 

were separate crimes and put them in (B), and take the 

things that are obviously sentencing factors and put 

them in (A) and (C). 

All right. Now, that's what it looks like 

if you just read the statute. I didn't find anything in 

the history that suggested any other intent. So why do 

you think that that change makes the difference? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I think there are --

there are several specific changes that Congress made. 

And I think it would be, perhaps, useful to look at the 

old statute and the new one, the old statute and the new 

one together and see why the things that -- that the 

Court said in Castillo are gone in the new one. So the 

old statute is in the petition appendix at 11a. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. HORWICH: And then the new statute is in 

the appendix to the government's opening brief at 1a and 

2a, so you can look at them side by side. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't the old one in your 

brief, too, in your --

MR. HORWICH: It is. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's 3a of the government's

brief. 

MR. NORWICH: It is, although, of course, 

you have to turn the page, and I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Okay. 

MR. HORWICH: Perhaps it's helpful to look 

at them next to each other, because the differences are 

quite stark --

JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. 

MR. HOWICH: -- when you do that. 

So the first thing is, as you suggested, 

Justice Breyer, the firearm type provisions were moved. 

But I think that that move signals something contrary to 

what this Court had perceived in Castillo. In Castillo, 

the firearm type provisions were part of the initial 

sentence that defined the elements. The sentence is 

rolling along, talking about using or carrying a 

firearm, and then in the same breath it goes on to start 

talking about specific weapons. And that is what, in my 

reading of Castillo, drove the Court's impression that 

the they -- that the machinegun provision there should be 

an element. 

The difference in the new statute is -- is 

that Congress has moved it away, textually, 

conceptually, structurally, away from the elements, 

which ought to suggest that Congress doesn't think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it didn't. It kept 

in (A) the subdivisions of use and brandishing, which 

we all agree are elements of the crime. So I don't know 

what it means to say that it moved it away from the 

elements. It mixed up in (A) elements and sentencing 

factors, and so what we have to discern was, did it 

intend to make (B) sentencing factors or not? 

And I think what Justice Breyer was asking 

you: What in the legislative history shows that? Where 

do we read, outside of Castillo, a conclusion that 

somehow Congress radically changed the assumptions we 

identified in Castillo, which is historically it's not a 

sentencing element? 

MR. HORWICH: So a few answers there. 

First of all, in the new -- in the new 

structure of the statute, on the government's view, the 

elements finish in the principal paragraph, and then --

then we're into sentencing factors. So brandishing and 

discharge were held in Harris and acknowledged in Dean 

to be sentencing factors. So we are sort of, at that 

point, on to sentencing factors. 

So I take from what this Court said in 

Harris, about the separation of brandishing and discharge 

from the elements in the principal paragraph to indicate 

that they are sentencing factors, would apply even more

strongly to subparagraph (C), which is even farther 

away. There’s -- there’s a period, a structural break, 

a new sentence. The thought in the principal paragraph is 

certainly complete. We’ve already been through some 

other sentencing factors, and now we’re --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, except that with --

with (C), you -- you could say that traditionally 

recidivism has been a sentencing factor, and you cannot 

say with respect to (B) that whether it's a 

short-barreled rifle or a machinegun has traditionally 

been a sentencing factor. To the contrary, it was an 

element. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I disagree with that, 

Justice Scalia, because the tradition, as I understand 

it, is relevant because it might indicate what Congress 

was thinking or what suppositions it had in mind when it 

passed a statute. 

And there’s a very -- there was a very 

different tradition at the time of the 1986 enactment of 

the old statute and the 1998 enactment of the new one, 

which is -- the big difference is that the sentencing 

guidelines came into effect in between those two times. 

And the sentencing guidelines -- sentencing 

guideline 2K2.1, the principal determinant of base 

offense level in the sentencing guidelines for

firearm-centric offenses in the Federal criminal law, was 

firearm type. So it was unmistakably that -- it was 

unmistakable at the time in 1998 when Congress enacted 

these -- these firearm-type provisions, that the 

sentencing guidelines were already making firearm type a 

sentencing consideration for the judge. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's -- let's talk about 

the guidelines. Without the application of (B), the 

guidelines would provide for a much shorter sentence, 

wouldn't they? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, the guidelines -- as 

before and as now for this offense, the guidelines level 

is the minimum. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The guidelines -- do you 

think that if under the guidelines the sentence was 

30 years because of a machinegun, do you think that that 

would be upheld? 

MR. HORWICH: I'm sorry. And your -- if I 

understand you --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think it would be 

upheld as a reasonable sentence under our Booker/Fanfan 

theory of -- of how the guidelines are to be applied? 

MR. HORWICH: A reasonable -- well, 

certainly courts have, since Booker, imposed even up to 

a life sentence for offenses that did not otherwise

trigger the elevated minimums. There’s at least one 

case in the few years since Booker that implied a --

that imposed a life sentence for a -- for an offense 

that would have been subject only to the base 5-year 

maximum. There are several that imposed -- imposed a 

life sentence for --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is the life 

sentence maximum, by the way? I -- you say this is a 

minimum. It's just a mandatory minimum because the 

maximum is specified to be life. Where is that specified? 

MR. HORWICH: The -- the maximum is not 

textually in the statute, but all courts that have looked 

at this have understood that. Certainly, it seems to be 

the supposition of this Court's statutory holding in Harris 

that the nature of -- the structure of this -- of the 

sentencing provision here is that there's a life maximum, 

and then the firearm --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where do you get 

the life maximum? I -- I'm reading through, and there's 

-- it mentions nothing about life. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, it is certainly the 

case, if we simply take (a)(1) --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And if it mentions nothing 

about life, then these are not mandatory minimums. To 

the contrary, they are -- they are new maximums.

crime was? Is it the attempted robbery or whatever it was? 

Is that -- because this is -- you're -- you’re saying this

MR. HORWICH: Well, I wouldn't describe it 

as an add-on. It is a separate Federal crime, in -- in 

the sense -- in the sense that it is bad enough and 

dangerous enough to commit a drug trafficking offense 

or engage in a crime of --

Amendment problem with reading a statute this way,

unlimited maximum when Congress hasn't specified it, and

implied maximum term here is -- is life. Congress --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't there a Sixth 

Amendment problem with not knowing what you are exposed

become de facto the maximum? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think what you are 

exposed to, as I read the statute, (c)(1)(A) does not 

impose a new sentence at all. It just says there will 

be added to whatever the sentence is for the crime of 

violence or the drug trafficking crime -- there will be 

added to that sentence. Then it says you’ll add 7 

years; you’ll add 25 years; you’ll add 30 years. 

Those are not mandatory minimums. Those are 

add-ons to the sentence provided by the substantive 

crime to which (c)(1)(A) refers. That way, the whole 

thing makes sense. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I don't think it would 

make sense to treat them, as you are describing them, as 

add-ons. There’s no question that this -- that this 

statute defines an offense that someone can be convicted 

of. That certainly is the implication of this Court's 

holding in Deal. It is a separate offense which 

therefore should carry its own punishment. And the 

contrast --

punishment provided for such crime of violence, et

MR. HORWICH: -- particular determinate 

sentences. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. HORWICH: If Congress had wanted to 

continue that approach, I assume it would have kept that 

language. It didn't. It changed the language. The new 

language says "be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 

not less than 5 years," which leaves -- which leaves --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It says “in addition to” at 

the end of (c)(1)(A): “Who, in furtherance … possesses a 

firearm shall, in addition to the punishment provided 

for by such crime of violence, be sentenced to” 5 

years, 7 years, 10 years. And then if the 

firearm, blah, blah, blah, is blah, blah, blah -- since 

your -- I assume that that introductory language "in 

addition to the punishment provided for" is implicit in

separate conviction of this separate offense. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MR. HORWICH: And that then it is a 

separate -- then from there it is a question what is the 

appropriate sentence for a conviction on the offense 

described in 924(c)(1), which is to say, well, it's a 

term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years, which 

holds open --

JUSTICE SCALIA: In addition to the term 

that’s -- that exists for the substantive offense. 

MR. HORWICH: I -- I agree. And if you look 

in subparagraph (D)(ii) it says that the term of 

imprisonment imposed under this subsection shall run 

consecutive to the other one, which -- which again shows 

that -- that the considerations for sentencing in this

a separate question what the sentence on the 924(c) --

JUSTICE BREYER: To make your life a little 

more complicated and difficult, though perhaps it makes 

it easier, we reach the questions that Justice Scalia 

was raising, I think, and they are important only if you 

win, only if we say that it is a sentencing factor. If 

it is a new crime, we don't have any problem, because if 

it's a new crime, the jury has to find the fact. 

But if it's a sentencing factor, then we get

into the problem of Harris versus Apprendi. And then you 

have to decide whether it's maximum, minimum, et cetera. 

But in Harris, I said that I thought Apprendi does cover 

mandatory minimums, but I don't accept Apprendi. Well, 

at some point I guess I have to accept Apprendi, because 

it's the law and has been for some time. 

So if and in fact, unfortunately for 

everyone, I was -- it was 5-4 in that, I think, so my vote 

mattered, and I don't know what other people think 

but in -- on this Court. But if that becomes an issue, 

if that should become an issue about whether mandatory 

minimums are treated like the maximums for Apprendi 

purposes, should we reset the case for argument? Or do 

you feel, in your opinion that -- that you’ve had 

enough of an argument because you devoted two or three 

pages to this topic? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, to answer -- well, first 

of all, there certainly has not been in -- in the 

briefing or argument here, any opportunity for this Court 

to consider what it would need to consider to overrule 

McMillan. We’re not talking about overruling Harris. 

We’re talking about overruling McMillan. And --

Apprendi did significantly change McMillan, but that’s --

would be my -- my second point, is that -- is that since 

-- I think it has been become clearer since Harris that 

the rule in McMillan and the rule in Apprendi coexist 

quite well and coexist in a principled fashion, and 

that there is -- and that there is no -- Harris was 

correct in light of Apprendi, which is -- which is in 

the following respect. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Does the government believe 

that it has sufficiently argued this, or would you suggest 

on the government's behalf that if it becomes an issue 

it's set for reargument? That was really my question. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, yes, we would certainly 

want to set it for reargument --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the right answer. 

MR. HORWICH: -- obviously. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. HORWICH: But -- but I -- again, I don't 

even think that's necessary. Respondents have offered 

nothing in the way of a justification for overruling 

Harris. And again, the distinction is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why can't we just say, as 

Judge Boudin did, they weren't -- this revision was on 

the books before Castillo was decided, so obviously 

Congress wasn't trying to adjust the statute in response 

to Castillo. And they -- they made it read more easily.

We know the one thing Congress was concerned with was adding 

possession, which was not there before. So they added 

possession. They made it more readable. 

Some of the concerns that were expressed in 

Castillo are certainly present here. There is a huge 

jump from a 5-year add-on to a 30-year add-on for -- for 

the machinegun. So why don't we just say, well, this 

statute has been revised, but it wasn't in response to 

Castillo? It's not all that different. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I disagree that it's 

not all that different. And -- and for the following 

three -- for three reasons. First of all, setting aside 

my disagreement with Justice Scalia, if you accept that 

the statutory maximum is life, as I believe every court 

to have confronted this understands it to be, then this 

statute belongs to an entirely different tradition than 

the tradition that Castillo belonged to, which is to 

say that this statute -- the -- the role of firearm type 

in this statute is to channel the sentencing judge's 

discretion by ruling out certain low sentences when 

certain facts are present, such as the presence of a 

machinegun. 

That is something that when Congress wants 

to channel --

maximum? 

MR. HORWICH: No, I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In -- to the person who 

would otherwise, in the judge's discretion, qualify for a 

lower sentence, doesn't it become that person's maximum 

once you have indiscretion? 

MR. HORWICH: I disagree with that because 

the principle -- the background -- the basic principle 

behind Apprendi and our criminal law is that what you 

can rely on is what Congress has said in the statute or 

in -- as Booker holds --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What you can rely on in 

an indeterminate sentencing regime without a minimum is 

that you’ve got a statutory maximum, whatever it may 

be, but a judge's discretion to start from zero. If 

that judge was inclined to give you zero, isn't the 

minimum then your statutory maximum? You're -- because 

that's what the judge has to give you. 

MR. HORWICH: I disagree with that, because 

it is not the only thing the judge can give you. The 

full range of punishment above those minimums is 

available. I was indicating earlier that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and only got one out. 

MR. HORWICH: Right, and perhaps only 

half of that one, which is -- which is that in the -- on 

the question of -- of tradition, Congress apparently 

exclusively uses sentencing factors when it wants to do 

nothing more than give some rules to the judge to 

channel his discretion with minimum sentences. We 

observed this in our opening brief, and Respondents said 

nothing in response. 

As far as we know, every time Congress wants 

to channel a sentencing judge's discretion, it does it 

with a sentencing factor. That is a difference. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. Number two? 

MR. HORWICH: Number two is that the -- is 

that the -- the -- the linguistic change here, the 

textual change, the fact that subparagraph (D) says "a 

person convicted of a violation of this subsection." 

That presupposes there has been a conviction, that the 

jury has been charged with whatever the elements of the 

offense are and that now what's going to be stated in 

clauses (B)(i) and (B)(ii) are things that are relevant 

at sentencing. 

And then the third -- and then the third 

point is -- is that -- is essentially the structural

change from -- that I alluded to earlier, of moving 

firearm type wholly away from the elements of the 

offense. That made a difference to this Court in 

Harris. It is -- it would be, I think, irreconcilable 

with this Court's holding in Harris to say that 

brandishing and discharge have been moved far enough 

away from the elements to make them sentencing factors, 

or rather are stated far enough away from the elements, 

structurally separated enough to make them 

sentencing factors, but then to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Those are all -- all 

three of those are -- are pretty subtle ways for 

Congress to change the view in Castillo. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I would agree that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Moving something 

from the body of the paragraph to a separate section and 

so on. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I would -- I would point 

out -- of course, one has to -- one has to recognize what 

Congress had before it when it -- when it made the 

change, which is to say, when it -- when it embarked on 

these revisions, there was a one-to-one circuit split on 

the question. And by the time it had finished making 

the changes, it was actually three to one in favor of 

sentencing factor interpretation in the old statute.

Now, I agree that if Castillo had been on

might be a basis to say that Congress was acquiescing in 

that interpretation. But it's -- it's -- Congress was 

certainly concerned with much more substantial issues in 

the revisions. And the fact that it did not comment 

further should not be a reason to -- to not pay 

attention to the structural and textural changes that it 

did make.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

I think it's important at the outset to set 

the context for this case. The government cannot point 

to a single defendant under this provision for the 

conduct at issue who has ever received more than 

10 years in prison absent the use of a machinegun. 

We cited a long string of cases in the

O'Brien brief and the government's response in its reply 

brief was silent. So, therefore, the government is here 

today claiming that it is entitled, based on the fact of 

a machinegun, to get 20 years more than any defendant 

that perpetrated this conduct has ever gotten, and 

indeed 18 more years than the government itself asked 

the district judge in this case for, once the machinegun 

provision was off the table, under the guise that this 

is nothing more than a sentencing factor. 

We think that this Court's statutory 

interpretation jurisprudence as well, if necessary, this 

Court's constitutional jurisprudence foreclose such a 

result. 

Let me start with statutory interpretation. 

On the government's theory in 1998, Congress stepped in 

and took a statute that made machinegun use an element 

and transformed it into -- into a sentencing factor. In 

other words, Congress, without a peep, a mutter, or 

anything, and in -- in the course of doing something 

entirely different, which was reacting to this Court's 

Bailey decision, stepped in and took a fact that 

formerly had to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable 

doubt to trigger a 30-year sentence and left that same 

sentence in place but now allowed it to be proved to a 

judge by a preponderance, based on a presentence report,

and, indeed, according to the government, also stripped 

away the mens rea requirement that attached to the 

statute when it was an element. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the short --

what is it, the one that gets 10 years, the 

short-barreled rifle? That's -- that's -- those two 

are together in the statute, and you said that it would 

be startling because of the difference between 10 years 

and the 30 years, but the short-barreled rifle is the 

same amount of time in discharging, and discharging is a 

sentencing factor. 

MR. FISHER: We think, Justice Ginsburg, 

that if this Court had to construe that statute in a 

different case, that provision, it would find it's still 

an element. Now, I grant that it’s a difference, a 

very significant difference between 10 and 30 years, but 

structurally it is an element. 

And I think an -- a good way to go about 

understanding this -- I heard my -- my opponent today say 

that this would be indistinguishable from Harris or fly 

in the face of Harris. 

Well, there's three very important 

differences between the machinegun provision at issue 

here and the discharge provision in Dean and the 

brandishing provision in Harris. The first difference

is that this an entirely separate subparagraph. 

Now, if you imagine somebody amending the 

statute and wanting to accomplish what the government 

says was accomplished here, why wouldn't the firearm 

type provisions just have been (iv) and (v) under 

capital letter (A)? They’re not. 

What the draftsperson did instead is break 

them out into an entirely separate, stand-alone 

provision. As the AUSA described it, when he charged 

them in the alternative in the district of 

Massachusetts, he said I think it's a greater and lesser 

offense situation. And that's what we think. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I guess I'm not 

following the ball here. I thought the government had 

conceded that sub (i), sub (ii), sub (iii) under (A) are 

not sentencing factors but are elements. Is that not --

MR. FISHER: I don't understand that to be 

what the government has said. I believe the 

government's argument is that the big paragraph with 

capital letter (A) sets forth the elements, and then sub 

(i), (ii), and (iii) are merely sentencing factors. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, they have to because 

that's what Harris said, brandished --

sentencing factor. 

MR. FISHER: That's right. That's right, 

Justice Ginsburg. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's even worse, 

then. I agree with you. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. FISHER: So what sub (B) does, as I 

said, is it creates a greater offense, and so, it’s 

broken out in a way that incorporates the earlier 

elements up above in the main paragraph by using the 

phrase: If a “firearm possessed by a person 

convicted of a violation of this subsection.” 

That phrase, we believe, incorporates the 

earlier elements. Remember in Harris this Court 

emphasized that the brandishing provision just kept 

going in the sentence and did not incorporate earlier 

elements. 

So when the government stands here today and 

says, well, when you incorporate the earlier elements, 

that shows it’s a sentencing factor, too, it seems to me a 

situation of heads, I win; tails, you lose. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, their -- their -- their 

basic argument is look at the statute. (A) has what is 

undoubtedly a set of sentencing factors. Brandishing and 

discharging are as traditional as they come. Then look

at (C), and you find some other ones that are sentencing 

factors, because recidivism is as traditional as it 

comes. And between those two they put (B). 

So since the neighbors, (A) and (C), are 

certainly sentencing, they must have meant (B) to be a 

sentencing factor, too. I -- as I understand it, that 

is one of their basic arguments. 

MR. FISHER: Right. And let me -- let me 

give two responses to that. First of all, if you --

if you look again at the appendix of the government's 

main brief, which is 1a and 2a, the guts of the 

statute is the “use or carry” language or “possesses a firearm” 

language in the main paragraph. 

And then, the -- from the “possessed” language 

down through sub (iii), what you have is the Bailey fix 

right there. So, then what happens --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And you believe there is a 

background of life sentence? You agree with the 

government that --

MR. FISHER: I don't think that’s 

necessarily the case, Justice Scalia. This Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it either is or 

isn't. You --

MR. FISHER: -- has said a couple of times 

that this is a theoretical maximum sentence, but, surely,

if nothing else, the Sentencing Reform Act sets a 

maximum sentence here if it's not just a straight 

determinant sentence. 

And we've argued at length in the O'Brien 

brief that the reasonableness requirement under 3553 of 

the Sentencing Reform Act would have to set a maximum 

sentence. And for the reason I said at the outset, 

given that no one has ever received more than 10 years 

absent a machinegun here, certainly that maximum 

sentence would be far less than life and far less than 

30 years. But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the -- I don't want 

to interrupt your nice organization here. But what is 

the principle, the general rule, that you articulate to 

support the distinction between 30 being necessarily an 

element and 7 a sentencing factor? What's the general 

rule here? 

MR. FISHER: Let me answer it --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than, this is 

just --

MR. FISHER: If I might say one more --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- other than how awful this is. 

MR. FISHER: If I might say one more 

sentence to Justice Breyer, and then I’ll answer that.

MR. FISHER: Justice Breyer, the other thing 

I'd point out is that, so therefore, once you make the 

Bailey fix, you just come -- in the old statute, then 

you come to the machinegun provision, and you just leave 

it where it was. And, in fact, there are plenty of 

statutes that we’ve cited in both briefs where there are 

elements in the middle, sandwiched between sentencing 

factors. 

Now, Justice Kennedy, you asked the general 

principle. The general principle is this, at least in 

terms of this Court's Sixth Amendment law, is that: The 

critical question to ask is whether the defendant could 

receive the sentence the government seeks without the 

fact at issue. 

Seven years is a sentence the defendant here 

could receive without the machinegun finding. Thirty years 

is absolutely off bounds. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that just based on 

empirical studies or is there guideline support for 

that? 

MR. FISHER: There is both, Your Honor. Of 

course, the guidelines are not binding --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand. I understand 

that.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Could 

otherwise receive under what? The sentence -- you say 

7 years is a sentence he could otherwise receive. 

MR. FISHER: Under the facts that either we 

prove to the jury or are admitted by the defendant. 

So -- so in this case, the defendant could receive 7 

years, and we've conceded that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: There must be some 

statutory provision that you -- that you -- that you 

rely upon. 

MR. FISHER: Oh, certainly, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does 7 years come 

from? 

MR. FISHER: Seven years comes from -- comes 

from the statute, for brandishing, which is what both 

defendants had admitted that they did. Seven years --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but we know 

that's a sentencing factor. 

MR. FISHER: But they've admitted it. So 

they've waived any Sixth Amendment right as to that 

sentencing factor. We're willing to concede that. But 

then you go to the guidelines, which sets a 

7-year -- a 7-year recommended sentence.

Under this Court's jurisprudence following 

Booker, we know that we take that recommendation and we 

plug it into section 3553(a), which, if you want the 

statutory language, directs that a sentence “no greater 

than necessary to serve the following factors” be 

introduced -- I'm sorry, be imposed. And when you look 

at those factors, disparity is a factor this Court has 

left in place and emphasized at every term since Booker, 

and the guideline sentence. And when you put -- plug 

those things into the facts here, we simply suggest 

there is no way that it would be upheld as substantively 

reasonable if the defendant got 30 years absent the 

machinegun fact here. 

And we’ve also cited in our brief several 

places where the government itself makes this -- the 

mirror image of the argument that I'm making in the 

post-Booker, Gall, Rita world, when judges deviate 

downward from the guidelines. They emphasize -- we 

quoted one Eleventh Circuit case in our brief where the 

government got overturned, as substantively unreasonable, 

a downward variance from a guideline recommendation, 

because no defendant had ever received such a low 

sentence. 

But I don't have to, of course, hang my hat 

on this -- on the strict application of Apprendi here.

We think there's also an even deeper problem that 

predates this Court's Apprendi jurisprudence, which was 

flagged by this Court as early as McMillan, where this 

Court said that if what Congress does is step in 

and manipulate the elements of a crime in order 

to relieve the government of its obligation to prove 

ordinary and traditional elements, then we have a pure 

due process problem, irrespective of any Sixth Amendment 

problem. 

Now, this Court has never found such a 

problem, but I would emphasize that the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do we find it with 

this statute, if there’s a 10-year minimum/maximum 

under (A) subdivision (iii) if the firearm is 

discharged, and it's 10 years; and if it's a 

short-barreled rifle under (B), it's also an equal 

amount, of 10 years? I think that's what 

Justice Ginsburg was pointing to. 

So the question I have for you is: How do 

we find substantive unreasonableness? 

MR. FISHER: How do we find substantively 

unreasonable after Booker? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Unreasonableness, that 

there was an act of manipulation here, or intent to 

manipulate.

MR. FISHER: Well, if you’re asking me the 

question -- I want to be sure I understand and answer the 

question. If you’re asking me how applying the 

principle this Court first articulated in McMillan, and 

you apply it here --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly. 

MR. FISHER: I don't think you have to look 

any further -- well, there is two places you can look. 

You can look both at the intent of Congress and the 

effect of what it did. 

The intent of Congress, at least as 

hypothesized by the Solicitor General, is laid out at 

page 33 of its merits brief, where it says: What 

Congress was intending to do here is, quote, "simplify 

and streamline guilt-stage proceedings" by relieving the 

government of its burden to prove this case -- this fact 

beyond a reasonable doubt to the judge. So that strikes 

one as, as this Court put it in Harris, an intent to 

evade the ordinary requirements in the Fifth and Sixth 

Amendments. 

Then, as to effect, you can look at what 

I've also -- what I've already emphasized, which is that 

this sentence simply is not otherwise available, absent 

that fact. And that, on its own, ought to tell this Court 

that it's dealing with an element.

But if it wants to dig even deeper, it could 

-- it could describe it in terms of a 20-year increase 

over what the defendant would otherwise get or what, 

indeed, as we’ve said, anyone has ever gotten for this act, 

absent a machinegun. It could do it in terms of percentage 

and say it's 83 percent higher; the Court used the phrase once, 

"tail wagging the dog." I don't think it matters 

exactly what exact avenue this Court would pick. Again, 

if it were doing a constitutional analysis -- I’m 

speaking right now constitutionally instead of 

statutorily -- it would all end up at the same place. 

But I want to make sure that I understood 

your question also, with due respect to you, Justice 

Ginsburg, because what I was talking about was 10 years under 

(A)(iii), of course, is a sentencing factor, as this Court 

held in Dean, whereas under (B)(i), the same length of a 

sentence might be an element. That was a matter -- that 

was a statutory answer, and I think, as a matter of 

statutory construction, which is, of course, the first 

thing you're going to address in this case, what we 

think we can win on without even reaching the 

constitutional questions. And the differences would be, 

apart from the same sentence, you have the structural 

difference that I've emphasized. You have the tradition. 

And let me say a word about tradition, if I

might. The government emphasizes the guidelines and 

other kinds of statutes. When this Court applies the 

tradition canon that it established in Almendarez-Torres 

and Castillo, I don't know why you have to look any 

further than Castillo itself to answer the tradition 

question. In Jones, as this Court put it, the reason we 

look to tradition is because if it's a close case, we’re 

going to not assume that Congress intended a radical 

departure from past practice. Well, the past practice 

here is absolutely unequivocal. This Court held in 

Castillo, 9-0, that Congress intended this to be an 

element. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the Court's --

the Court's opinion in Castillo quite carefully noted 

that it wasn't addressing this statute. I think it's a 

little bit of a bait-and-switch to say that, well, 

Castillo decides this case. 

MR. FISHER: I don't contend that Castillo 

absolutely decides the case. My contention that I was 

trying to make is that when this Court looks to 

tradition for purposes of construing the new amendments, 

that Castillo gives the answer on -- at least on 

tradition, at least as applying that particular 

question. Because Congress, we know, intended it to be 

an element at least until 1998.

But I think that even -- even if you were to 

step back from the Castillo analysis itself and the 

Castillo factors themselves, you would also, I think, do 

well to give -- again, not dispositive, but -- but 

careful treatment to Castillo, because Congress steps 

in, of course, and amends statutes all the time. They 

step in and they amend one portion of a statute, and 

while they are at it, we know from the manuals that we've 

cited and from the examples in the back of the O'Brien 

brief that Congress often, while they’re amending one 

part, they reorganize or reword other parts of the 

statute. 

And this Court, across its statutory 

interpretation jurisprudence, within criminal law and 

outside, has always said that once we say the law means 

something, we're not going to assume that Congress 

changed the law unless we get some sort of clear 

indication from Congress that it -- that it intended to 

change the law. 

Now, here, as I think has been emphasized, 

but I’ll just reiterate, there’s not a peep of 

anything in the legislative history or anything to 

suggest that Congress was -- was intending to change the 

law here. And, in fact, it's not even a mere silence 

case. We know quite clearly and affirmatively that

Congress was intending to do something entirely 

different, which was respond to this Court's Bailey 

decision. 

But even in the language -- and the only 

thing I think the Solicitor General even has for it in 

this case is the language and structure, which are some 

different words and different placement that it can at 

least build an argument off of, because the other four 

of the five Castillo factors are entirely unchanged. 

But even the language, we submit, is a far cry from the 

kind of change this Court ought to require before it 

does a 180-degree switch as to what it had said the 

prior law meant. 

Just for purposes of stability in the law, 

if nothing else, I think this -- it behooves this Court 

to take its prior decisions seriously and to -- and to 

engage in a dialogue with Congress that encourages 

Congress to be clear when it wants to change what the 

prior law is. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The prior statute -- which 

was 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1), right? That did deal with 

short-barreled rifle, short-barreled shotgun, 

machinegun, and so forth, but that's -- that provision 

didn't say anything about brandishing or discharge. 

Where -- what was -- how were they treated under the

prior law? 

MR. FISHER: They -- as you say, they were 

not in the statute itself. My understanding is that 

judges as -- on an ad hoc basis, would have treated 

those as sentencing factors. 

And what Congress did -- when it came in to 

respond to this Court's Bailey decision, I think it 

codified all of the different manners of using the gun 

in the context of one of these crimes. So it not just 

dealt with, yes, possessing ought to be covered, but it 

talked about other manners, brandishing and discharging. 

In Castillo, this Court emphasized again the big 

difference between manner of using a gun and the type of 

firearm which lies at the core of this offense. 

If I would turn -- if I would leave the 

Court with nothing else, let me emphasize again to the 

Court the difference between this statute, which I think 

the government wants you to think is no different in 

intent, effect, or operation than the two that this 

Court prior -- dealt with in Harris, as a matter of both 

statutory construction and constitutional law, and in 

McMillan, as a matter of constitutional law. 

What this Court emphasized in both of those 

cases was that there was a preexisting law on the books 

that criminalized certain activity. And then a

legislature later stepped in and set a mandatory minimum 

for a particular fact that could accompany the crime at 

issue. And it did so in a very minor way. For example, 

in Pennsylvania, the various crimes covered by the 

firearm mandatory minimum in that case gave 10-, 20-year 

sentences routinely, and all the Pennsylvania 

legislature did was step in and say: If he uses a gun, 

we want at least 5 years. And in Harris, as I've 

just emphasized, I think, in discussing with 

Justice Scalia, the Court dealt with a bump of just 2 

years. Again, what judges were already customarily 

doing, I think, under the statute. 

Here, this is entirely and dramatically 

different. Here, the fact allows a sentence -- indeed, 

requires a sentence -- that is 20 years longer than 

anyone has ever gotten for this conduct at issue. That 

is a difference not just -- it's not a minor difference. 

It is a categorically different difference that we think 

is enough, combined with other principles of statutory 

and constitutional interpretation, to -- I'm sorry, 

statutory interpretation to resolve this case on the 

statute alone. 

But if you need to look to the Constitution, 

we think that the Sixth Amendment, either as the 

bright-line rule articulated in Apprendi dictates that

any fact that allows a greater sentence than the 

defendant could otherwise receive is subject to the 

Sixth Amendment, or sort of plain, pure due process, 

tail-that-wags-the-dog analysis, that this Court 

emphasized in McMillan -- either of those would be 

enough, and indeed require, a finding of 

unconstitutionality here and a finding this Court 

can avoid. 

And if nothing else, Justice Breyer, I would 

say that we think that this case can be resolved on statutory 

grounds. We think there are narrower constitutional 

arguments that would either require reading it narrowly 

or striking it down if you had to, on even narrower 

grounds. But if nothing else, then we would ask this 

Court to revisit Harris, if necessary. 

We don't think it's necessary to resolve the 

case for us here, but we think that would be appropriate 

if it -- if it needed to get there. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a collateral point: 

Does the government have to show, or does the -- don't 

you have to find that the machinegun is operable? 

MR. FISHER: I assume so, but I don't know 

the specific answer to that, Justice Kennedy. What 

there is a dispute about, of course, is whether the --

if it were a sentencing factor, whether the government

has to prove knowledge. And we do emphasize that that 

would be an alternative basis for this Court to decide 

this case, by saying you at least have to prove 

knowledge even if it’s a sentencing factor. 

And let me just leave you with this, unless 

there are any further questions: The government makes a 

couple points in its reply brief suggesting that certain 

arguments were not preserved or made properly in this 

case. The knowledge argument that I just referred to is 

raised in the brief in opposition for Mr. O'Brien at 

pages 23 to 25. So under rule 15 of this Court, that 

argument was properly presented at the cert stage. You 

will also find that argument at pages 34 to 37 of the Joint 

Appendix. 

Also with respect to the Sixth Amendment 

substantive reasonableness as-applied argument, the 

government suggests that for some reason, that would be 

inappropriate for this Court to reach or rely on. 

Again, we disagree. First of all, we can't understand 

why it would be inappropriate to reach or rely on that 

constitutional argument, whereas it is apparently 

appropriate for this Court to address the McMillan 

argument or the “overrule Harris” argument. They’re 

all three constitutional arguments that are present in 

this case. And, again, if there were any doubt they

were raised below, pages 38 and 39 of Mr. Burgess's 

First Circuit brief, pages 32 to 35 of Mr. O'Brien's 

First Circuit brief, and in the brief in opposition, 

which the government, in its reply brief at the cert 

stage, responded to without claiming any error or any 

waiver problems. So we think absolutely all the 

arguments that are made in the blue -- in the red briefs 

are clearly before you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN HORWICH 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. HORWICH: Thank you. 

Justice Kennedy, just to answer your 

question: The definition of "firearm" in 921(a)(3) 

includes a weapon that is designed to expel a 

projectile, so one that can be restored to do so also 

qualifies as a firearm for purposes of the statute. 

My friend made the comment that brandishing 

and discharge would have been treated, under the old 

statute, as sentencing factors. But they couldn't be,

because the old statute had determinant sentences, and 

brandishing and discharge weren't relevant to it. So 

there wouldn't be a higher sentence for those. 

And that -- that reveals sort of a basic 

flaw in this notion that somehow those can be treated as 

sentencing factors, but Congress wasn't embarking on a 

general litany of sentencing factors. Congress inserted 

those to be sentencing factors, as the Court recognized 

in Harris. Then what it did is move the firearm-type 

provisions next in line, because that's what it thought 

of them as, not as elements. It moved them away. And 

then it goes on to recidivism, which is also a sentencing 

factor. 

So the overall result, then, of the statute 

is that it's sort of an instruction manual. The first 

thing that comes up is the elements; that's what the 

judge uses to charge the jury or take a plea. That 

ends. The statute takes up the next topic, which is 

sentencing. The judge needs to ascertain the limits of 

his discretion. And then the statute ends with some 

technical considerations. 

That -- that approach is entirely in line 

with the sentencing factor tradition, and that's --

that seems to be what Congress intended. But my friend's 

understanding of the statute is sort of this disorganized

jumble, and he's making very much of the idea that when 

Congress revises a statute, it tries to confront -- it 

tries to make it better, on his view. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there anything 

other -- do we have anything other than the statute 

itself? When I looked at the statute itself, I thought, 

well, all that's happened here is nobody's thought of 

this issue at all; nobody's read Castillo. What really 

happened is somebody in the legislative drafting section 

was focusing on what he said they were focusing on, 

Bailey, and then they have a form manual. So they 

followed the form manual. 

Now, is there anything to suggest that isn't 

what happened? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, there is no legislative 

history, but there is the fact that the form manual says 

if you’re going to embark on this, here are some ideas 

for how to do it. But it doesn't tell you -- it does 

not tell Congress substantively what it should do. 

Someone had to make a choice to write that introductory 

language, "a person convicted of a violation." And that 

is what Congress passed, and so Congress intended that 

those things, firearm type, that follow that are 

relevant after the person has been convicted of a 

violation.

One final answer to your question 

Justice Scalia, about the life maximum. This Court 

held -- in Custis v. United States interpreted the same 

language, “not less than” a certain number of years. 

That's in 924(e) of the Armed Career Criminal Act. The 

Court held that to have a life maximum sentence there. 

So I think the same would apply -- the same would apply 

here. 

And so the final thing I would want the 

Court to take away then from this is that Congress is 

using firearm type to channel a sentencing judge's 

discretion. The life maximum exists in all cases. 

There have been cases sentenced up to life even where 

that was far above the minimum. And when Congress does 

that, it uses a sentencing factor. It doesn't create 

greater and lesser included offenses for the jury; it 

does it by addressing the person who is in charge of 

sentencing, which is the judge, and giving him a rule of 

decision. That's what the text and the structure 

indicate here and that's what the Court should hold. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
