 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument next 

in Global Crossing Telecommunications versus Metrophones 

Telecommunications. Mr. Fisher.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FISHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Complaints alleging violations of the FCC's 

pay phone compensation regulations allege just that, 

violations of regulations. The regulatory violations do 

not give rise to private cause of action under section 

206 and 207 of the Communications Act. The proper point 

of departure in this case begins at section 276. There 

Congress directed the FCC to create a system guaranteeing 

pay phone providers compensation for the services that 

they provide to callers who make dial around calls. 

There can be little doubt that the FCC has ample 

authority to enforce the system it created 

administratively.

 But nothing in Section 276 or anywhere else 

in the Act contemplates that violations of the FCC's 

implementing regulations should give rise to a private 

cause of action for damages in Federal court.

Accordingly, this Court should reverse the Ninth 

Circuit's decision allowing pay phone operators to bring 

through the back door the kinds of cases that Congress 

declined to allow through the front.

 There's nothing upsetting about reaching 

that result here. The Communications Act quite sensibly 

limits private damages actions in Federal court to those 

alleging violations of the Act itself. And claims that 

long distance providers -- I'm sorry -- claims that long 

distance providers have violated the pay phone 

compensation regulations require the parsing and the 

application of the extraordinarily complex and 

ever-changing FCC rules and regulations and orders.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Fisher, may I ask you this 

question? In your view, did the regulations create a 

legally enforceable obligation?

 MR. FISHER: Yes, Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And where may that obligation be 

enforced?

 MR. FISHER: Our position is that can be fully 

enforced in the FCC. And in fact, the FCC is hearing 

complaints like this all the time.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: By means of a private action 

before the FCC?

 MR. FISHER: Yes, by means of an administrative

action before the FCC.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Where the carrier -- where they 

would file a complaint saying you owe us X dollars, and 

the agency could order them to pay X dollars.

 MR. FISHER: That's right. And if you look at the 

Sprint amicus brief at page 23, the brief cites several 

cases just like this one that the FCC has fully 

adjudicated and in some cases awarded damages.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And is the obligation 

enforceable in State court?

 MR. FISHER: No, we believe -- of course, this 

Court did not grant certiorari --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that. I'm curious 

to know what your view is.

 MR. FISHER: If this Court holds there is no 

private cause of action in Federal court, then it is not 

enforceable in state court either. Our position is that 

there is only an administrative remedy that's available.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the administrative remedy 

that you just conceded is a counterpart to a private 

right of action, or isn't it? Would you get the same 

thing? I complained to the agency, and say, I didn't get 

-- the pay phone provider wasn't paid, and X under the 

commission's regulations was supposed to pay it. So I 

complained against X. Could I get before the FCC exactly

what I could get in court, so that we're only talking 

about which form is proper, or is there a difference in 

the remedy?

 MR. FISHER: In terms of damages, we're talking 

about exactly the same thing, Justice Ginsburg. The only 

difference between being in Federal court as opposed to 

the agency is that if you're in Federal court, the 

Communications Act has a fee shifting provision. And we 

think that further underscores the Congress's scheme 

here, which is to reserve Federal court actions for 

serious violations of the Communications Act, and that's 

where fee shifting kicks in. Ordinary --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And before the agency, you 

don't get counsel fees?

 MR. FISHER: That's right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Fisher, I realize you don't 

concede, in fact, quite to the contrary, you deny that 

the failure to pay the full rate is -- could be 

considered a practice here. But let's assume for the 

sake of argument that it is a practice within the meaning 

of the text. 

If the -- if the agency had explicitly said, what 

we are doing here in defining this practice as unlawful 

or unjust, is to define it as such within the meaning of, 

what is it, 201(b), so they make explicit reference to

the statute and they say, we are fleshing out the 

statute, would your position be the same?

 MR. FISHER: I think that's very much what the 

Commission is contending here Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it wasn't textually as nice 

as that?

 MR. FISHER: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they have made it that, 

haven't they, in a later regulation? Haven't they said 

just that.

 MR. FISHER: In a later order, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: In a later order, yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume in the reg itself, 

they were that precise. Would your position be exactly 

the same?

 MR. FISHER: Yes. The result would be the same. 

And I think you're asking me to put aside for the moment 

whether the FCC was correct in saying it was a covered 

practice.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure.

 MR. FISHER: And in terms of the FCC calling this 

unjust and unreasonable, the problem with that is that 

the only reason the FCC has ever given that this is 

unjust and unreasonable is because it violates its 

regulations. And if there's one thing we know from the

structure of the Communications Act, it's that for 

something to be remedial in Federal court, in other 

words -- and if we know something violates 201, it is 

remediable.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. FISHER: It has to be.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You invite me to change the 

hypothetical, then, by jacking it up in this respect. 

The FCC gives the reason. And it says, the reason it's 

unjust and unreasonable is that the carriers are getting 

a free ride on the pay phones, et cetera.

 So they fill in the gap that you claim. 

They have a reason. Would your answer or your position 

still be the same?

 MR. FISHER: Yes, because the reasoning the FCC 

would give simply would not be a permissible construction 

of the terms unjust and unreasonable in 201(b).

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Are there any times under any 

circumstances that you can think of in which the FCC can 

adequately and validly define a practice as unjust and 

unreasonable within the meaning of the statute so that, 

in fact, in applying the statute, we would follow -- be 

bound to follow the regs?

 MR. FISHER: Of course, in the vast majority. Let 

me give you some examples, and then I'll distinguish it

from this case. The easiest example is rate of return 

regulations that the FCC can pronounce. So the FCC can 

say how much long distance companies are able to charge 

for certain services. Fleshing out the amount that they 

can charge so that they're not in effect gouging 

consumers is a regulation that this Court could look to, 

but --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But why can't they pass a 

regulation that says don't gouge pay phone operators?

 MR. FISHER: Well, that goes to the heart of this 

case, Justice Souter, in the kind of regulations that we 

have. What we have here is not the FCC telling long 

distance providers to give pay phone operators money that 

long distance operators ought to owe pay phone operators. 

The money that's at issue here, the 24 cents per 

call is the money that callers owe the pay phone 

operators. If you look back at the D.C. Circuit's 

decision --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do they? I mean, the 

statute of the United States says that -- I think I'm 

correct -- the statute of the United States says they 

can't be required, the caller cannot be required to put 

in the quarter in order to get the 800 number and so on.

 So as a matter of law, don't we have to say that 

the, in practical terms, the caller doesn't owe?

Somebody owes. Somebody ought to pay for the use of this 

facility. But Congress has said it is not the end user.

 MR. FISHER: You are right, Justice Souter, 

insofar as we're trying to capture the money here for 

essentially the equipment rental or the access fee that 

the caller is availing himself of. But Congress has not 

said that money cannot rest on the caller's shoulders. 

All Congress says in Section 226 is that the caller 

cannot be required to pay in advance. 

The FCC during its rulemaking proceedings actually 

considered two alternatives where the caller would have 

paid in full compliance with Section 226. One would be 

the caller paying with a later billing device like a 

credit card, billing it to their home phone number. 

Another option the FCC considered would have been 

where the long distance providers would have billed 

customers on behalf of the pay phone operators. Either 

way, the customer would have paid. Even the respondent 

in his brief openly --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the customer is going to 

pay if, in fact, the long distance carrier is the one who 

has to make the immediate payment, because that payment 

is going to be figured in the long distance rate. So 

that ultimately, the end user is going to pay for the 

service he gets, and Congress is simply saying, the way

to make this thing work in a sensible and simple way is 

to require the long distance carrier to make the 

reimbursement. 

The economic end result is exactly the same as it 

would have been if they had said, well, you can send a 

bill for 25 cents to the end user.

 MR. FISHER: The economic result may be the same, 

but with all due respect, Congress has not decreed that 

the administrative system work this way.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It hasn't decreed 

otherwise.

 MR. FISHER: It hasn't decreed otherwise. 

Congress essentially --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that the classic situation 

in which agencies are supposed to figure out what to do?

 MR. FISHER: Congress gave the FCC power in 276 to 

come up with a plan. But this case, as the Ninth Circuit 

decided it is not under 276, it is under 201, so the 

question is whether failing to comply with the 

administrative plan --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, as I understand it, it came 

to the conclusion not that they were not acting under 

276, but that, in fact, the cause of action has to refer 

back to 201.

 MR. FISHER: That's right. I'm sorry. It brings

us back to the question that you asked: Whether the 

Ninth Circuit, or the FCC for that matter, can shoehorn 

this into 201 as an unjust and unreasonable practice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In your answer for why 

they can't, Justice Souter's comment is a classic, this 

is what administrative agencies do all the time in 

typical rate regulations. They make a determination that 

utility shareholders have to bear this cost. The rate 

payers can bear this cost. And at the end of the day, it 

is a determination that a rate is reasonable or 

unreasonable.

 And it seems to me that that is just what is 

involved here. I don't know why their determination 

about how to allocate who has to collect the rates, and 

whether they can pass them on or not makes it an 

impermissible interpretation of what's unjust or 

unreasonable under 201.

 MR. FISHER: Well, Chief Justice Roberts, the FCC 

was unquestionably acting under 276 when it did this. So 

the question is whether you can go back to 201. And as I 

said, you need to start with section 206 and 207 because 

we're in Federal court. And that says that violations of 

the Act are remediable but not of regulations, in 

contrast to numerous other sections. 

So the question in asking whether it violates 201,

it has to be something more than simply the FCC's 

regulation wasn't followed. And we need to ask ourselves 

what kind of regulation is it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are rate making regulations 

issued under 201, do they purport to be the FCC's 

definition of what is just and reasonable compensation?

 MR. FISHER: That's right. That's what I conceded 

to Justice Souter earlier.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They are issued under 201.

 MR. FISHER: I think largely they are.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So they are an interpretation of 

the statutory language in 201.

 MR. FISHER: That's right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you say this one is not.

 MR. FISHER: That's right. And this Court can 

look several places, but it can first look to 

these -- this regulatory regime that was created, which 

was always thought of as being triggered by section 276. 

And then asking --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say it was always 

thought of as being triggered by 276, did the FCC 

reference 201 in issuing its determination that a failure 

to follow these regulations was unjust and unreasonable?

 MR. FISHER: In its order, it references 276 and 

201. In the regulations -- I thought I was being asked

about the regulations -- it leads with 276.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose it issued the regulation 

after notice and comment, and said -- violation of the 

pay phone order is an unjust and unreasonable practice, 

would the case be different?

 MR. FISHER: No, it wouldn't be. And I think I 

want to flesh out and make sure I've gotten across the 

distinction between the rate making --

JUSTICE BREYER: You haven't. Maybe -- if this 

doesn't clarify it. I think everyone has about the same 

question. You have a bunch of pay phone operators. And 

if the AT&T were charging them too much, I think everybody 

would say that the FCC can say, hey, that's too much. You 

owe them 2 cents a call refund, and everybody would agree 

that the people who are hurt could go into court and bring 

a lawsuit and get the 2 cents. Right under 47 U.S.C. 

201(b).

 Now, the only difference here seems to be that it 

wasn't AT&T that was charging, in my example, too much. 

They weren't paying what they owed. They should have 

paid what they owed. And that, says the FCC, is, under 

201(b), an unreasonable practice. And, therefore, go in 

and collect it in court. Now, what is the answer to 

that?

 So far I have heard nothing that suggests

that this couldn't be an unreasonable practice under 

201(b), which is just what the FCC said it was. Now, 

what's wrong with what I said? I'm simply trying to 

focus you upon what I think is the question that's 

bothering some of us.

 MR. FISHER: There are two things that are wrong 

with that, Justice Breyer. The first thing is that in 

contrast to ordinary rate making regulations, here, in 

the absence of regulations, long distance providers would 

owe pay phone operators zero. There's no reason why long 

distance providers would give money to pay phone 

operators.

 The 24 cents here is to capture what callers 

owe the pay phone operators. And so the FCC has come up 

with an administrative system. But there's nothing 

unjust or unreasonable about long distance providers not 

giving money to pay phone operators before the regulatory 

regime drops into place, whereas there is plenty that is 

unjust and unreasonable about overcharging, for example 

JUSTICE BREYER: So, my answer -- not answer, but 

my characterization of what you have just said is that the 

FCC did say it was an unreasonable practice. But in your 

view, it was not an unreasonable practice not to pay.

 And you want us to go back and second-guess, which

we could, if their view of unreasonable practice is 

unreasonable itself. And I guess you would have to 

overturn it. I didn't know that was what the case was 

about, but are you saying now that that's the issue? 

They said it was an unreasonable practice not to pay this 

money, you think it is a reasonable practice not to pay 

the money. There is a dispute. That's what we should 

do.

 MR. FISHER: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then what should we do?

 MR. FISHER: Well, what you should do is reverse 

the Ninth Circuit.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You say it would be a reasonable 

practice not to pay the money, but for the existence of 

the regulation.

 MR. FISHER: That's exactly right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Just like AT&T when, in fact --

or any other utility that, in fact, runs into situations 

every day of the week, where but for an FCC regulation, 

they would not be overcharging, because they have a way 

of doing it that isn't on its face unjust. But the FCC 

writes some regulations and now it is unjust. So I guess 

to take that argument would overturn, I guess, about a 

hundred years of rate making law. Wouldn't it?

 MR. FISHER: No, it wouldn't. Justice Scalia, I

think, has captained that position. And what we're 

saying is the FCC can pick a fair rate once it is 

something that long distance providers or any common 

carrier ought to be compensating somebody for. But what 

we are saying here is, this is a purely administrative 

creature. And then it gets to the second reason why --

JUSTICE BREYER: So in other words, you are saying 

-- I think it is common that the FCC might write some 

accounting rules, for example. And they might say, 

before these accounting rules, Mr. Bell's system in San 

Francisco, you could charge people 8 cents a call. But 

given the way we set up the accounting rules, we think 

this month you have to do 7 cents in the first six 

months, 7 cents, in the next six months, 9 cents. And 

any deviation from that is unreasonable. And the company 

does deviate. I would have always thought when they do 

deviate, they are behaving unreasonably, and someone who 

pays too much could go into court and get money back.

 Am I wrong about that?

 MR. FISHER: No, you would have been right, 

Justice Breyer. We're not asking -- even the Louisiana 

Public Service Commission is another example of 

something. And that brings me -- I think I should go 

back to what --

about the accounting rules. What would they be issued 

under? Would they be issued under 201?

 MR. FISHER: They might. The question that we 

would ask is whether it affects carriers' relationships 

to their customers. Now, under Justice Breyer's 

hypothetical, and this is the Louisiana Public Service 

Commission --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me accounting rules 

-- in order to decide what is just and reasonable, you 

have to have accounting rules. So the accounting rules 

fit very comfortably under 201.

 MR. FISHER: I don't think we're disagreeing. 

What I want to do is distinguish those from the case we 

have here, and go back to Justice Souter's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: May I focus your return to me? 

Because I want to take up with where your answer to 

Justice Scalia left off. As I understand it, you were 

saying that the rate in this case is unreasonable because 

the party or the person who is responsible for the use of 

the pay phone facilities is the person who's making the 

call, not the long distance carrier.

 My question to you is, isn't that simply a choice 

of characterization? Because another way of looking at 

it would be that the person who makes the call wants to 

use long distance facilities to get to the person he

wants to talk to. And, therefore, the long distance 

facility in every pay phone case is using the pay phone 

in order to get the customer to what the long distance 

facility provides.

 Why then isn't it just as fair to characterize the 

use of the pay phone here as for the benefit of the 

carrier as for the benefit of the customer? And if that 

is just as fair, doesn't that end the distinction that 

you drew with Justice Scalia saying that it is not fair 

in this case.

 MR. FISHER: No, for two reasons. The first is --

I just want to be clear, we are not challenging the FCC's 

authority to have created the regulatory regime it did 

under 276. So the FCC could well have picked, as it did, 

long distance providers to be on the ultimate hook here.

 But the reason -- but the problem with saying that 

-- I'm sorry. I lost the train of thought in your 

question.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: My question is simply, you can 

say -- one way of looking at this transaction is, it is 

the guy making the call who's using it. Another way is 

to say the long distance facilities carrier is using it 

to get the call to the long distance facility. If you 

look at it in way B, doesn't your argument for 

unreasonableness disappear?

MR. FISHER: Thank you. That would be an entirely 

different case than the one we have here, Justice Souter. 

The 24 cents that the respondent is seeking to recoup 

here, if you go back and look at the regulatory system --

and that's what they are asking for, is the 24 cents that 

the FCC regulations entitle us to -- was calculated -- in 

fact, the D.C. Circuit made the FCC go through this 

exercise three times to get it right. So to calculate 

that 24 cents, it is purely a function of the amount of 

money that the caller owes the pay phone operator.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What difference does that make? 

What difference does that make? The use of the phone is 

of a value of 24 cents. But the value of using the phone 

is a value not only to the caller, but to the long 

distance provider who couldn't provide anything to the 

caller without the pay phone? Why isn't the alternative 

characterization just as easy, regardless of how they get 

to 24 cents?

 MR. FISHER: I think another way to perhaps 

characterize your position is, why is this like a 

commission that they are seeking. And the reason why is 

because that number may be very different than 24 cents. 

If there was such a commission that could exist, it would 

be far less. And the respondents are not seeking that 

amount of money.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Excuse me, but aren't you arguing 

with the 24 cents, as opposed to creating an argument 

about what is the proper characterization of the 

transaction?

 MR. FISHER: I don't think so. All I'm saying is 

if you started with trying to compensate pay phone 

operators for the service they provide -- that you're 

characterizing as the service they provide to long 

distance carriers, you end up with a far different 

number. Who knows what you would end up with. Probably 

end up with zero. Because take an example of somebody 

who rents a cell phone for the weekend. They might make 

lots of long distance calls on the cell phone, but nobody 

has ever thought that a long distance carrier ought to be 

kicking back money, for example, to the store that rented 

the cell phone to the customer over the weekend.

 And I want to return, I think in Justice Breyer's 

question --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The reason is that the store that 

rents the cell phone is getting rental income from the 

cell phone. And in the case of the pay phone, the pay 

phone operator is going to get zero, unless there is some 

such scheme as this.

 MR. FISHER: Right, but then we're back to the 

rental income question, and the question of whether it

would be unjust or unreasonable for long distance 

providers, absent the regulations, to be the ones paying 

that rental income.

 And the answer, we submit, is no. And the problem 

that I think we've gotten off on a couple times brings us 

back, I think, to the assumption you asked me to make at 

the beginning of the argument, that something is a 

covered practice under the Act.

 And so another way to understand the distinction 

between the accounting rules, the rate making exercises 

and all the rest in this case is that section 201(b) of 

the Act doesn't cover everything in connection with a 

communications service. It only covers certain practices 

in connection. And the history, as well as the text and 

structure, shows that it regulates common carriers acting 

as such.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't cover certain 

practices in connection. It covers all practices in 

connection.

 MR. FISHER: I think we agree with respondent, Mr. 

Chief Justice, that in looking at 201(b), you have the 

word such communication practices. And to understand 

what that is referring to, you look back up at 201(a) and 

see the universe. Now, the beginning of 201(a) is what 

we colloquially call the carrier customer section of the

Act. And that's the core of 201(b), which says that when 

a common carrier is providing service, it needs to act 

justly and reasonably. Here -- and with accounting and 

rate making and all the rest, those are things that 

affect rates and service to customers.

 What we have in this case is something very 

different. This is a carrier-carrier relationship. So 

you need to look somewhere else. And what respondent 

says is you look to the end of 201(a), which talks about 

physical interconnections between carriers. But the 

problem with that argument, and the reason why this falls 

outside 201(b), even if it is somehow unjust and 

unreasonable, is that the carrier-carrier relationships 

are governed only when the FCC has ordered physical 

interconnection.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are saying that, 

putting aside 276, it would clearly be impermissible for 

the FCC to say one way that long distance carriers 

provide service to their customers is when those 

customers use pay phones; and, therefore, we're setting 

up this rate regime in connection with that service. You 

would say that would be outside the scope of 201(a)?

 MR. FISHER: As we're still talking generically, I 

don't think it necessarily would be. Because it could 

regulate the relationship between long distance providers

and their customers. I mean, that's the core of what 201 

is about. It's about how much they can charge, what kind 

of practices they can have in relationship to their 

customers. But here we're not talking about a long 

distance provider that is a common carrier in 

relationship to its customers or in relation to its rates 

and practices.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's actually -- that's, I 

think, your strong -- to me that was the strongest 

argument. When I finished reading it, I thought, well, 

so what. You know, I mean, can you see why I thought 

that? I mean, today's rule is different. It is true 

that you don't have simply a single telephone company 

providing service ultimately directly to the customer. 

You have everything mixed up. And there are a lot of 

inter-carrier things. Language covers it. Purpose 

covers it. Facts and circumstances change.

 MR. FISHER: We submit it is a not a "so what," 

Justice Breyer. Because section 201(b) is broad, but 

it's not all-encompassing. And Congress plenty of times 

in section 276, and in lots of other sections of the 

Communications Act, has responded to modern necessity by 

giving the FCC expanded jurisdiction, just as it did, as 

I said here, in section 276. 

But our core position here is that when Congress

expands the FCC's authority, and it doesn't create a 

concomitant Federal right of action along with it, it is 

telling the FCC to handle these things administratively, 

use its expertise, craft regulations and enforce them 

accordingly.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Fisher, can I go back to the 

first question I asked you? Would the FCC have had 

authority to create an administrative remedy that had a 

fee shifting provision in it?

 MR. FISHER: The FCC might have that authority. 

Section 154(i), as well as other sections in the Act, 

give the Commission broad authority in crafting its 

administrative enforcement regimes. I haven't focused on 

that exact question, but it might well be able to say 

that in order to have this properly enforced, we need to 

have fee shifting.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It could certainly impose 

penalties of some kind.

 MR. FISHER: Yes, it could, and the FCC could 

double fine -- the FCC could do lots of things. That's 

our very purpose, is that the FCC ought to be the single 

forum deciding what kind of an enforcement mechanism is 

best, not leaving it to Federal courts across the 

country. And as Ninth Circuit invites, state court 

rulings across the country with varying rules.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.,

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. ENGLERT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court:

 It is not particularly unusual for the grants of 

authority in the FCC -- to the FCC throughout the 

Communications Act to be enforceable through the 

provisions of section 201(b) barring unjust or 

unreasonable charges, classifications, rates, or 

practices.

 Justice Scalia asked a question during Mr. 

Fisher's argument about, what about the accounting rules? 

Would they be prescribed under section 201? They would 

be prescribed under section 220, which is the provision 

of the Act that governs accounting. And they would also 

be prescribed under the last sentence of section 201, 

which is the general authority given to the FCC to 

promulgate all of its rules. 

But nothing in those facts would keep a violation 

of those rules from being enforced as an unjust or 

unreasonable practice under Section 201(b).

JUSTICE SCALIA: What can't -- what can't be 

sucked in under section 201? I mean, once the FCC issues 

a regulation, it's easy to say that any violation of that 

regulation is unjust. And that's what's happened here. 

And this just makes a farce of the provision that says 

the only private causes of action are for violations of 

the statute and not for violations of the regulation. 

It seems to me if this thing, 276, can get sucked 

into 201 simply by reason of the fact that failing to 

obey an FCC regulation is unjust, that provision is a 

nullity.

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor, first of all, the 

FCC has never argued, and we have never argued that all 

FCC regulations are enforceable through a private right 

of action. I mean, to give an example, as --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I'm saying you'd have to 

argue that if the theory you're propounding for this case 

is correct. Violation of an FCC regulation is unjust. 

Failing to comply with an FCC regulation is unjust.

 MR. ENGLERT: No, no, Your Honor. The phrase 

unjust or unreasonable is a classic phrase delegating to 

the administrative agency the authority to make the 

determinations in the first instance of what's just and 

reasonable. If, for example, there were a violation of 

the regulation forbidding giving credits to political

candidates, the FCC could decide in the first instance 

whether the violation of that regulation rises to the 

order of unjust or unreasonable.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So can -- every FCC regulation 

can be enforceable by private action? All the FCC has to 

say is that violation of this regulation is unjust.

 MR. ENGLERT: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No?

 MR. ENGLERT: There are also examples of things 

that fall outside of charges, classification, rates or 

practices. There are examples in the case law. There 

are old ICC cases in which providing a particular type of 

boxcar was deemed not to be a charge, classification, 

rate -- held not to be a charge, classification, rate or 

practice. 

There is a recent D.C. Circuit case involving an 

attempt to dictate, in the FERC context, to an energy 

company who can be on its board of directors.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But at least -- at least any FCC 

regulations relating to charges, practices -- and you 

want to interpret practices very broadly --

classifications, and regulations for and in connection 

with communication service, all of those regulations can 

be sued upon in Federal court with all the diverse and 

contradictory rulings that that will produce, so long as

the FCC says that the failure to obey this regulation is, 

in our view, unjust.

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor, let's start with 

statutory text. Section 206 says that there is a damages 

action for anything in this Act declared to be unlawful. 

Section 201(b) says unjust or unreasonable 

classifications, practices, et cetera, are declared to be 

unlawful. So we have a very precise match in statutory 

text between 201(b) and 206. 

Now, what Mr. Fisher's argument amounts to is to 

say that if it is covered in a regulation, it is exempted 

from being called an unjust or unreasonable charge, 

classification, practice, et cetera, because that would 

allow the FCC to enforce too much. But if we start with 

the text Congress enacted, there is a precise match 

between 201(b) and 206. 

And to say that that which the FCC hasn't 

regulated is more subject to judicial review --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think he's saying that. 

I don't think he's saying that if it is covered under 

regulation, it can't be unjust. Some regulations do 

relate to justness and reasonableness, but not 276. 

I think what he's saying is 276 established a scheme. 

It didn't have to be this scheme. It could have been 

some other scheme. Nothing in the nature of things says

that the long distance carrier has to be the one liable 

for this. 

It rather was simply imposed by the FCC. That's 

fine. But to say that it would be unjust for them not to 

do that is just unreal, unless you're going to allow any 

violation of any FCC regulation to be unjust.

 MR. ENGLERT: Your Honor, our position doesn't 

require us to argue that it would have been unjust for 

the FCC to adopt some other scheme. Our position is that 

once the scheme is in place, it is unjust to depart from 

that scheme in the way Global Crossing did, just as once 

a scheme of rate regulation is in place, even though 

there could be many different schemes of rate regulation, 

it may be unjust or unreasonable to charge a higher rate 

than that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the rate regulation is -- is 

established in order to determine what reasonableness and 

justness requires. And 276 is something quite different.

 MR. ENGLERT: I respectfully disagree, Your Honor. 

276 is, asks -- was a delegation by Congress to the 

agency to fill in the details of a plan to make sure that 

pay phone service providers were fairly compensated, a 

phrase not very different from just and reasonable, for 

each and every completed interstate and intrastate pay 

phone call. They really fit quite nicely together as

opposed to being in tension with one another.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is it possible -- I was worried 

somewhat about, I think, the problem Justice Scalia 

raised, that old regulations become unjust and 

unreasonable. And then I thought, no, but tell me if 

this is right. That they're going to fall within 201(b) 

only if a violation is unjust and unreasonable.

 Now, we could say, and moreover, the FCC has to 

find that a violation of these rates is unjust and 

unreasonable, that is, it has to focus on it, make that 

determination. And then, of course, that determination 

has to be a reasonable interpretation. In other words, 

it can't just call anything unjust and unreasonable --

MR. ENGLERT: That's right. The usual --

JUSTICE BREYER: And it has to focus on the fact 

that their doing so will create this private remedy in 

the courts.

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: That that -- if you have that 

tough -- which I haven't seen anywhere, but I mean, if 

you had that tough a requirement, so they actually have 

to focus on it, it would tend to minimize the problem of 

a thousand different actions in ten thousand different 

courts and a big mess.

unjust and unreasonable? I'm certain you can't squeeze 

any rate -- it is not the case that any and every 

regulation can be -- fall within.

 MR. ENGLERT: No, that's right. The usual Chevron 

limitations apply. And in your question, Justice Breyer, 

you added to the usual Chevron limitations that the FCC 

has to focus on --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah --

MR. ENGLERT: Well, that's fine. Here the FCC did 

focus on it and is criticized for having focused on the 

consequences for judicial action.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but reasonably 

criticized for it. I would have thought your answer 

would be unjust or unreasonable has, for generations, 

been given a very expansive reading. And you don't need 

to say that the FCC has to do what typically I would have 

thought was a job for a court, which is to determine 

whether there's a private right of action to bring its 

action within a boilerplate term like unjust or 

unreasonable.

 I would have thought the contact point was what I 

was talking about with Mr. Fisher earlier, which is 

whether or not this is such communication service under 

201(a), which is -- which is, again, I suppose, something 

that the agency gets deference on. But it would seem to

me, that's where the limitation would come.

 MR. ENGLERT: Mr. Chief Justice, let me address 

the interplay between 201(b) and 201(a), because Mr. 

Fisher has simply misunderstood our position. 

We cited the second half of section 201(a) not to 

say it applies of its own force here, but to say that it 

disproves the contention that the communications services 

referred to in the phrase such communications service in 

201(b) have to be limited to carrier-customer relations, 

because 201(a) isn't limited to carrier-customer 

relations. 

Yes, all 201(a) does of its own force is allow the 

prescribing of through routes and interconnections. But 

there is no possible way to read 201(b) as limited to 

carrier-carrier communications in light of the full 

breadth of practices covered by 201(b). So that's the 

reason to cite 201(a) is simply to disprove Mr. Fisher's 

contention about the limits on 201(b).

 The phrase such communications service is actually 

used in 201(a) and in 201(b), and the antecedent in the 

first few words of 201(a), the such communications 

service, is interstate or foreign communication by wire 

or radio. So 201(b) isn't necessarily restricted to 

either carrier-carrier or carrier-customer relations, but 

such communication service relates back to all

communication by wire or radio, which is what we have 

here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but wait. Wait. 

Wait. It says to furnish such communications service, is 

what (a) says. And they don't furnish such 

communications service to your client.

 MR. ENGLERT: No, but -- well, that's debatable, 

but what 201(b) refers to, in any event, is in connection 

with --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Such communications service.

 MR. ENGLERT: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I would think that would mean 

such communications service that was furnished.

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, they have furnished a 

communications service to a customer, not to us, but to a 

customer. So again, this is connected with that 

communications service. And as the colloquy with Justice 

Souter earlier touched on, the caller pays sooner or 

later. 

Under the FCC's regulatory scheme, and in part 

because of the prohibition on advanced caller payment in 

226(e)(2), what happens is the long distance carrier gets 

the money, and they're saying there's no private right of 

action to make them give it back. In other words, the 

world would look quite different without a regulatory

scheme, but it would not be a regulatory scheme in which 

they get all the money they are currently purporting to 

keep. 

Now, Mr. Chief Justice, you also asked a question 

about the flash point on whether the FCC was improperly 

or suspiciously commenting on the scope of the private 

right of action as opposed to interpreting a substantive 

provision. The private right of action provisions are 

206 through 208, the provisions that let the complainant 

go to either court or the Commission. 

The FCC said nothing controversial about the scope 

of 206 through 208. The controversy is over the scope of 

201(b), which is a substantive provision. But once you 

have something brought within the scope of 201(b), after 

the application of traditional tools of statutory 

construction with Chevron deference, the private right of 

action follows automatically under 206 and 207. 

It is not a matter of the FCC reaching out to say, 

we are going to create a private right of action. It is 

a matter of the FCC construing a substantive term with

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think that's 

right, but that's also why I guess I don't regard it as 

particularly helpful that the FCC opines on what the 

consequences of its determination that something is

unjust or unreasonable under the statute are, with

 MR. ENGLERT: Well, it may not be particularly 

helpful, but it is surely not particularly harmful. And 

they did have a reason --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, except that it is none of 

their business.

 MR. ENGLERT: If they were trying to construe --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We --

MR. ENGLERT: -- 206 through 208, Your Honor, I 

might agree. But they construed 201(b) and commented on 

the consequence. And this is quite important, that it is 

their business, because 208 is the provision under which 

each and every one of those Commission proceedings cited 

in the Sprint brief, which Mr. Fisher alluded to, has 

proceeded before the agency. 208, just like 206, 

requires a violation of the Act, so it is very much their 

business to decide whether these pay phone controversies 

state violations of the Act. If they don't, the 

Commission has absolutely no power to proceed under 208, 

which is the only provision under which any 

administrative proceeding has ever gone forward.

 There are some arguments made here that they 

clearly have the authority to proceed administratively 

even if you can't go to court, but Mr. Fisher hasn't

identified the source of that authority. And the sources 

identified in the brief are section 4(i), which has been 

problematic, and others -- and other sections on which 

the FCC has never relied on in this setting, and some 

kind of divination of an action within Section 276 

itself. 

The question was put at one point to Mr. Fisher, 

could the FCC mandate fee-shifting as part of this 

administrative remedy it's going to create. Well, if you 

read 276 broadly, it's giving the Commission great powers 

to create administrative remedies, notwithstanding 208, 

which was supposed to be the administrative provision, 

then maybe anything goes. But we're getting awfully far 

from the statute that Congress wrote and giving the FCC 

awfully expansive powers to construe 276, while also 

denying the FCC rather mundane powers to construe rather 

ordinary phrases of administrative law, "unjust or 

unreasonable," in 201(b). 

Now, with respect to the question of whether this 

is a practice in connection with a communications 

service, Mr. Fisher argues strenuously that it is not.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just be sure I understand 

your argument on 208. You're saying that 208, like the 

earlier provision of the statute, requires a violation of 

the statute, not just regulations, in order for there to

be an administrative remedy.

 MR. ENGLERT: Yes, Justice Stevens, and section 

207 expressly gives the complainant a choice of forums.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So the same statutory 

requirement for the remedy that your opponent challenges 

is the one he acknowledges is available.

 MR. ENGLERT: That's correct, and in fact, Global 

Crossing -- Global Crossing went so far as to argue 

before the Ninth Circuit that there is no administrative 

remedy, that there's simply nothing to do except get 

fines under sections 502 and 503, and has reversed its 

position before this Court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you should be arguing, 

then, that we should give Chevron deference to the 

Commission's interpretation of Section 208. And once we 

do that, if 208 governs this thing, then so does 206.

 MR. ENGLERT: I'm happy to make that argument.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you should be.

 MR. ENGLERT: With respect to the question whether 

practices are limited to carrier-customer relations, I've 

already touched on that by talking about the interplay 

between 201(a) and 201(b). But there's another angle of 

approach for that issue, which is that in the Louisiana 

Service -- Louisiana Public Service Commission case, this 

Court was asked to draw the inference, just as it has

been in this Court, from other provisions in the 

Communications Act, that those phrases always refer to 

carrier-customer relations. 

And the Court said, no, that phrase can also refer 

to depreciation rules, so it's not limited to 

carrier-customer relations, the inference from other 

provisions of the Act doesn't flow. And the reason is 

there are words of limitation when those words, "charges, 

classifications, rates or practices" are used in those 

other sections that make it clear that they apply only to 

tariffed services. You find no such words of limitation 

in 201(a) and 201(b) -- or in 201(b), excuse me. 

Now, there remains the argument that there's a 

mismatch between section 201 and the relevant regulations 

because the regulations apply to intrastate as well as 

interstate calls, and section 201 applies to interstate 

or foreign communications. 

That argument appears for the very first time in 

merits briefing in this Court. It wasn't made below. It 

wasn't made in the cert petition. It wasn't made to the 

agency. And that's a problem, because the limits of the 

FCC's ability to regulate jurisdictionally mixed 

communications depend on factual determinations, factual 

determinations neither the agency nor even the lower 

courts have ever been given a chance to make.

But had this issue been raised in a timely 

fashion, I suggest that it would have been appropriate 

for the FCC to reach intrastate as well as interstate 

communications because long distance -- dial-around calls 

are overwhelmingly long distance, overwhelmingly 

interstate, and it is difficult to sort out which calls 

are which. In fact, the seven years of rulemaking the 

FCC underwent in this case largely were because of the 

difficulties of keeping track of particular pay phone 

calls.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I saw that argument. I 

have to say I don't understand it. Why is it so 

difficult? I get a bill every month that easily sorts 

out which are interstate and which are intrastate.

 MR. ENGLERT: Sorting one call from one carrier 

that has a relationship with you is not difficult, or 

sorting 100 calls from a carrier that has a relationship 

with you is not difficult. 

But when you go from a PSP to an inter-exchange 

carrier to a switch-based reseller, matching up the 

information of all three is -- has proven, in practice, 

to be quite difficult. And it's especially difficult in 

an era in which you can't just tell by area codes, for 

example, whether something is interstate. If I dial 202 

to 202, I may be dialing someone's cell phone out of

state. 

Now, the judgment below could be explained 

on the alternative ground that a violation of the 

regulations constitutes a violation of section 276. 

Before I even get to the substantive discussion, let me 

respond to the absolutely groundless claim that that 

argument has been abandoned. Global Crossing cites a 

bunch of cases involving section 1291 appeals in which 

people didn't appeal a particular order after final 

judgment, and says that's an abandonment of the claim. 

That's both correct and irrelevant. This is 

a 1292(b) appeal and there is no final judgment on any 

claim in this case, certainly not on the 276 claim, so my 

client certainly hasn't abandoned it. 

My client was also a party to Greene and lost 

Greene and has argued the merits of the section 276 

position all along. On the merits, section 276 contains 

rights-creating language that creates a concrete monetary 

entitlement, focuses on the party benefitted, and does 

not have an aggregate focus. Global Closing doesn't even 

try to defend the Ninth and D.C. Circuits' reasoning that 

the statute does not contain rights-creating language. 

That leaves the tricky question whether a 

violation of the regs can be deemed a violation of the 

Act itself when Congress specified only the right, but

didn't specify what fair compensation was, and didn't 

specify who had to pay the compensation. 

In that respect, I think Alexander v. Sandoval, 

though it's been cited against us repeatedly, is actually 

helpful to our position. That case says it's meaningless 

talk about a violation of the regs separate from a 

violation of the Act, and that a Congress that intends an 

Act to be enforced intends the regulations filling out 

the Act to be enforced. 

I think the theory of Chevron itself is also 

helpful to our position in this regard, because the point 

of Chevron is that the use of broad language constitutes 

an administrative -- a delegation of authority to the 

administrative agency, not just to fill in details, but 

to give definitive content to a statute whose direct 

content is less than definitive. 

So it is perfectly appropriate to talk about this 

statute, section 276, and its rights-creating language as 

ordering the FCC not just to create a plan, but ordering 

the FCC to create a plan that has a particular goal such 

that violation of that goal can be deemed a violation of 

section 276 itself.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

 MR. FELDMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 

the Court: 

There is no dispute in this case that under 

sections 206 through 208 of the Communications Act, a 

party damaged by any violation of the Communications Act 

may bring an action either in Federal court or before the 

Commission to obtain damages. The scope of the remedies 

before the Commission under the kind of standard primary 

provision of the Act that deals with damages, 208, and 

207 mentions it as well, the scope of the action before 

the Commission and before the court is exactly the same. 

Now, because petitioner's -- therefore, if --

well, because petitioner's failure to pay fair 

compensation to respondent was an unjust or unreasonable 

practice --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just ask this. Is it the 

same with respect to fee-shifting?

 MR. FELDMAN: No. The Act in 207 -- I believe 

it's 207 -- specifically says that you may, the court may 

award attorneys' fees in an action in court. It doesn't 

provide that -- there's no similar provision for actions 

before the Commission. But the scope of the kind of

thing that Congress decided that a complainant could 

bring either to the Commission or to court is exactly the 

same. There's no way to drive a wedge between them. 

There are other provisions of the Act, as Mr. 

Fisher said, where Congress specifically authorized the 

Commission -- an action before the Commission for 

damages. But those are -- those provisions which 

Mr. Fisher cited are in section 226, which do not have to 

do with common carriers. They have to do with automatic 

dialing, with do-not-call lists, with things like that, 

where the person who's violating it is definitely not the 

-- never going to be a common carrier. 

In those provisions, Congress found it necessary 

to say, okay, we have to now give you the authority to 

create a damage action. 

But in other provisions, where you are dealing 

with common carrier, 206 through 208 provides Congress's 

determination of what the scope of a damage action should 

be either before the Commission or before a court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have a position on 

whether or not Chevron deference is owed to the 

Commission's determination of whether or not their action 

creates or gives rise to a right of action?

 MR. FELDMAN: I think that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There are two different,

it seems to me, two different Chevron questions. The one 

is the deference on its interpretation of what's unjust 

and unreasonable. The other is the question of whether 

or not they have anything to say about whether that means 

there is a private right of action in court.

 MR. FELDMAN: I think that -- I guess we don't 

have a position on whether 276, independent of 201, would 

be sufficient to have a prior right of action under 206 

through 208. But as for 201(b), once -- the FCC does 

certainly gets deference, has gotten deference for a 

hundred years for its determination of what is an unjust 

and unreasonable practice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's never gotten 

deference, at least I guess from this Court, on whether 

or not there is or is not a right -- whether there is a 

right of action to enforce its regulations.

 MR. FELDMAN: No, and I don't think the FCC here 

is claiming that there's a right of action to enforce its 

regulations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but they're certainly 

entitled to deference as to whether an administrative 

action can be brought under 208.

 MR. FELDMAN: That's correct, and that's why under 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Once you say that it can, then a

court action can be brought under 206.

 MR. FELDMAN: That's correct. That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you think we don't owe them 

deference for 206, but we do for 208. And if you give 

deference for 208, 206 automatically decides itself.

 MR. FELDMAN: Right. But 208, like 206 -- maybe 

I'm not understanding the question. Both provisions 

address only violations of the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. FELDMAN: So in order for the FCC to decide 

that there's an action either before the agency or the 

court, it has to identify a violation of the statute. 

Here it's identified 201(b) as being the provision that's 

violated. It's absolutely standard for a hundred years 

that -- I mean, Mr. Fisher says, well, you can't look at 

201(b) and decide who is supposed to pay and how much 

they're supposed to pay. That is absolutely standard 

from the very beginning of the Interstate Commerce Act, 

that you can't look at the words "just and reasonable" 

and decide whether a rate was just and reasonable or the 

practices that a carrier is using are just and 

reasonable. In fact, the whole --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is your position -- I want to be 

sure I understand you. Your position on the two 

different questions that the Chief asked you is, they get

deference on question one. And with respect to question 

two, it follows from the plain text of the statute.

 MR. FELDMAN: That's correct, that's correct. I 

would add also, with respect to the Commission's 

determination about what is just and reasonable, it was 

not just a question of saying that a violation of the 

regulations is just and reasonable. The Commission was 

charged here with the responsibility for adopting a 

compensation scheme that would provide for fair 

compensation for each pay phone operator for each and 

every call. And it spent a number of years and a number 

of different attempts working out what is a fair 

compensation. 

I would submit that all of that reasoning about 

what is a fair compensation scheme is also reasoning why 

it's unjust and unreasonable for a carrier not to pay the 

compensation. It's not just simply a question of an ipse 

dixit, it's a question of years of rulemaking and working 

out what the scheme should be, so it's fair. 

Once it did that, it didn't require a lot of 

explanation for why a failure to pay fair compensation 

that had been worked out over this period of time, a 

failure to pay that was unjust and unreasonable.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you making the point that 

Chief Judge Ginsburg made in the D.C. Circuit that it is

necessarily unjust and unreasonable to refuse to pay a 

charge that is fair and reasonable?

 MR. FELDMAN: Yes. I'm really expanding on that 

point, that it didn't -- the FCC has always gotten 

deference for what -- determining what is unjust and 

unreasonable under the Act. And it didn't require a 

great deal of explanation. The FCC's explanation here 

was more than adequate in light of its years of 

explanation about why this -- this scheme with these 

rates and these carriers and the primary economic 

beneficiary being the one who pays. All of that were 

reasons why this was fair compensation. 

Once it decided all of that, it didn't take much 

to say that a failure to pay fair compensation is unjust 

and unreasonable. That was adequately explained and 

didn't require a huge additional amount of explanation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What -- sorry, go ahead.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you would have a 

different position here if 276 said something like, we 

think there ought to be more pay phones; in order to 

promote investment in pay phones, we're going to have 

this scheme. In other words, it has nothing to do with 

whether it's fair or not, it's a subsidy. Then you'd say 

that could be something that's not covered by the "just 

and reasonable" provision?

MR. FELDMAN: I think in that case also, I would 

probably be here arguing that maybe if the FCC had 

determined that it's necessary, for whatever regulations 

they came up with under that scheme, in order for the Act 

to function correctly, that they have to be complied 

with. I think I would also argue that that was unjust 

and unreasonable. 

But this case, if the question is, did the 

FCC adequately explain what it did here, I think that all 

of the years of explanation of why something is fair are 

also reasons why it was unjust and unreasonable not to 

pay the compensation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there regulations, FCC 

regulations, the violation of which would not be unfair 

and unreasonable?

 MR. FELDMAN: I think there probably are. Mr. 

Englert mentioned a couple. I mean, there's probably 

numerous ones that wouldn't be. And in fact, the 

question about most FCC action, or at least a lot of FCC 

action, regulations, adjudications, and so on, most of 

them have to do with carriers' obligations, and most of 

them are things that have to do with what's unjust and 

unreasonable under the Act. And they've been enforced 

for years, in the -- you know, from the very early cases 

under the Interstate Commerce Act.

Mr. Fisher also suggested that there's a 

difficulty with numerous district courts deciding these 

issues as opposed to the FCC. Well, I would suggest that 

Congress decided that these kinds of actions can go 

either to district court or to the FCC. And in fact, by 

making damages actions, the scope of damages actions, as 

opposed to other remedies, co-extensive, did anticipate 

that there would be that result. The primary 

jurisdiction --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Depending upon how broadly you 

think Congress intends regulations to be sucked into the 

terms of this statute. I mean, your interpretation means 

Sandoval really didn't say a heck of a lot.

 MR. FELDMAN: I don't think that that's correct. 

It means that in the context of a statute that gives the 

agency authority -- that prohibits unjust and 

unreasonable action, which was not the case in 

Sandoval --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but you could say any 

violation of a regulation is unjust.

 MR. FELDMAN: No. I think it is possible that the 

FCC could determine that any violation of a regulation is 

unjust, and the FCC is entitled to deference for its 

determinations about what is unjust and unreasonable, 

that's been --

standards. But, in fact, when you look at questions of 

what's just and unreasonable over the years, it is -- it 

has always been the case that the agency entrusted with 

determining that and getting the communications system 

working or getting common carrier systems -- common 

carriers to fulfill their obligations, does have a lot of 

leeway in determining what is unjust and unreasonable in 

that context.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FISHER: Thank you. Let me begin, Mr. Chief 

Justice, with your question about whether the FCC can 

opine on remedies. All you need to do is look to what 

the FCC was telling everybody it was deciding in these 

order proceedings. It was deciding, and asked for notice 

and comment, on whether PSPs have a remedy for violations 

of the pay phone regulations. That is cited everywhere

in the briefs. It never asked for notice and comments, 

or considered whether failure to pay under the 

regulations is a violation of 201(b). 

So the question this Court needs to ask itself is 

when the FCC, by its own acknowledgment, until now, is 

simply opining on the presence of a Federal court remedy, 

whether it gets deference simply because it hangs the 

hook on a substantive provision of the statute. 

Now, there are three problems with what the FCC 

has done in construing section 201. The first is that 

this is not a covered practice, because I want to make 

clear our position, it's that the FCC has plenty of 

authority with respect to carrier-customer relationships, 

but not with respect to carrier-supplier relationships. 

And that's what we have here. 

On unjust and unreasonable, I think we need to 

unpack two separate questions. One is whether the rate 

the FCC chose is reasonable, whether the amount of money 

that it said needs to be put into pay phone operators' 

pockets is a fair and reasonable choice. We have no 

dispute about that. And we think that in and of itself 

could generate deference. 

But the FCC's determination to put the payment 

obligation on long distance carriers simply can't be 

shoehorned into the unjust and unreasonable phrase in

201(b), because if that's -- the only reason why 

anything, us failing to pay the money, would be because 

of the regulations. 

And you hear it again and again in their argument, 

the FCC having concluded that long distance companies are 

the ones that pay, the failure to pay is unjust and 

unreasonable. There's no way to get there without the 

regulations, and that's what distinguishes --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not true. You can 

say that this is a way you make a lot of money from your 

customers that you wouldn't otherwise make, because if 

there wasn't a pay phone there, they wouldn't be able to 

use your service.

 MR. FISHER: The FCC might have said that, but as 

I said to Justice Souter, that would be a very different 

proceeding and a very different scheme than we have here, 

and a very different dollar figure or cent figure that 

the FCC might have come up with when it was trying to 

encapsulate that figure, which we think is zero, but 

under your reasoning may be something very small. But 

that would be a very different case.

 Two more things. One is, on the jurisdictional 

mismatch question, Mr. Chief Justice, you are exactly 

right. It is not hard -- there are plenty of hard things 

in this case, but figuring out whether a call is

interstate or intrastate is not one of them. 

All you need to know is where the call originated from, 

and the number that was dialed, and pay phone operators 

have that information.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the cell phone 

example?

 MR. FISHER: This is a pay phone case. So all you 

need to know is the cell phone number and 

that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't know, the 

cell phone holder may be right next to the pay phone or 

he may be across the country.

 MR. FISHER: I think it still constitutes a long 

distance call, depending on where the cell phone owner 

lives. And that's still an easy thing to figure out, 

where the area code is. 

Finally, Justice Stevens, you asked a question 

about the co-extensive nature of the remedies under 206 

and 208. We don't dispute that the statute itself is 

co-extensive. What we're saying is that 276 gives the 

FCC more than ample authority to do what it's doing. 

Nobody has denied that, and so we think that that's the 

place to look for the FCC to craft the arrangement under 

Southwestern Cable. Combined with section 154(i), the 

FCC would have ample authority to do that.
