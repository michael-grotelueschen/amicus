 JUSTICE STEVENS: The Court will hear 

argument in Warner-Lambert against Kimberly Kent.

 Mr. Phillips, whenever you're ready we will be 

happy to hear you?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Justice Stevens, 

and may it please the Court:

 Six years ago, this Court in Buckman 

recognized that policing fraud against Federal agencies 

is hardly a field the states have traditionally 

occupied. Based on that premise, this Court in Buckman 

struck down a novel State tort that was based on the 

whole concept of fraud on the FDA.

 And the Court concluded that that tortious 

analysis as a matter of State law would inevitably 

conflict with the FDA's responsibility to police fraud. 

A responsibility that the Court recognized was 

essentially cradle to grave covered by Federal law. It 

arises out of Federal law, it is regulated by Federal 

law and it is ultimately terminated by Federal law.

 Michigan has adopted a unique product 

liability statute, and on the one hand confers a very

broad immunity of defense against all product liability 

claims for manufacturers who comply with the FDA's 

requirements.

 But then on the other hand, withdraws that 

immunity for the defense, this is PDA App. 42A, if the 

manufacturer intentionally withholds from or 

misrepresents to the United States Food and Drug 

Administration information concerning the drug that is 

required to be submitted pursuant to -- and then it goes 

and lists very specific provisions of the Food, Drug, 

and Cosmetic Act -- and the drug would not have been 

approved or the Food and Drug Administration would have 

withdrawn approval.

 It is difficult for me to imagine a statute 

that would more consciously and openly tread into 

exactly the same territory that this Court declared in 

Buckman as a matter of exclusive Federal and concern not 

available to the states to regulate.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Phillips, what if the 

statute didn't have that provision, but it just said you 

can bring a State tort action when the conditions 

approved by the FDA for the marketing of this drug have 

not been complied with? That's all it says. Now, would 

you knowledge that that -- that that suit could be 

brought?

MR. PHILLIPS: I will acknowledge that's a 

fundamentally different issue, Justice Scalia, because 

there you are talking about what duties are owed to the 

public that are enforced by the FDA and potentially are 

enforceable by the states as well.

 But here we're talking about duties that are 

owed from the manufacturer exclusively --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a duty that is defined 

by the FDA. And I didn't hear your answer. Would that 

suit be allowable or not?

 MR. PHILLIPS: That suit would not be 

barred, I don't think, by Buckman. I think the question 

there will really go to what the Court is going to 

decide next term in Wyeth as to how far when if you have 

FDA approval of certain activities that that has the 

effect of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't seem to me --

what I worry about is that if we say in this case it 

treads too much into the FDA's own responsibility to say 

what material should have been provided to the FDA, it 

seems to me the next what could be more central to the 

FDA -- to the FDA's job than determining whether the 

conditions the FDA prescribed for the marketing of the 

drug have indeed been observed? That's central as well.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't think it is an

unreasonable next step, but it is clearly the next step 

that has to be taken. Because what this Court decided 

in Buckman -- and it's central and candidly we are here 

seeking a very narrow ruling from the Court is that when 

you're defining the relationship between the 

manufacturer and the seller of the drugs and the FDA in 

terms of the disclosure of information to that entity 

and the determination both whether that information is 

adequate to allow the agency to perform its business and 

then, more fundamentally, whether or not the agency is 

acting in accordance with its own exclusive authority to 

decide how to proceed --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But one can also reason in 

the opposite direction; that is to say, one can know 

from the medical devices portion of the FDA that 

Congress has no objection to private tort actions 

that -- where the medical device manufacturer has not 

observed the requirements that the FDA's approval 

impose, right? We know from that section that Congress 

has no objection to that there.

 You can probably guess that Congress has no 

objection to it in the -- in the drug field as well as 

the medical devices field. And if I make that guess, 

what is so different about having a jury second-guess 

the provision of information portion?

MR. PHILLIPS: It seems to me that the same 

argument you just made, Justice Scalia, would have led 

the Court to the opposite result in Buckman, because 

what's the -- you know, if Congress didn't care about 

allowing State tort law to be -- to serve as the 

enforcement mechanism, then why wouldn't you allow them 

to do that in that context as well?

 And this Court said the reason is because 

there is a very uniquely Federal interest in taking care 

of the business and the relationship between those two 

entities.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, It is -- it is more 

of a stick in the eye of the Federal Government to 

create a cause of action that consists of defrauding the 

Federal Government, which is what was at issue in 

Buckman. The very cause of action was providing false 

information to the FDA. Here the cause of action is a 

standard tort cause of action for marketing a defective 

product.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, when you say "here" 

what we're talking -- what we're talking about here is a 

very unique State statute that is the sole basis on 

which the tort liability is set aside.

 We're not -- we're not pre-empting the 

underlying tort claims by the Federal law that's at

issue in this case. The State statute pre-empts the 

common law court claims. That first portion of the 

defense wipes those out. So it's not pre-emption of the 

traditional State law cause of action, as the Second 

Circuit wrongly evaluated it. What we're talking about 

here is a provision that in the most exquisite terms 

says: Allow the State, either by the court or the 

juries, to evaluate the adequacy of the information that 

the FDA required.

 And it's important to understand how that 

plays out, because what it says is pursuant to those 

statutes. It specifically identifies provisions in the 

statutes. It doesn't say anything about how the FDA --

how the FDA interprets those statutes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, isn't --

isn't the standard -- in the standard tort claim, no 

Michigan statute, but a defense that's available to a 

drug manufacturer who is charged with putting on the 

market a defective drug, its regulatory compliance, 

right?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so the State of 

Michigan has said: Drug dealers -- I'm sorry -- drug 

sellers --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- drug manufacturers, we 

are going to give you an invigorated defense. Instead 

of just saying you show regulatory compliance, we're 

going to take you off the hook altogether, except if you 

didn't come clean with the FDA, if you withheld 

information or misrepresented information.

 It seems to me that what -- you could say 

this is just like Buckman, but you could also say this 

is giving the manufacturer an invigorated regulatory 

compliance defense.

 So why shouldn't it be looked at as the 

second, rather than the first?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think what you're 

basically arguing for is an argument I think one of the 

amici made on the other side, which is: Does the 

greater power include the lesser power? That is, if we 

had the authority not to give you a defense in the first 

place, don't we have the authority to use this as a 

lever in order to allow us essentially to undertake to 

regulate in precisely the same way the FDA would?

 And the answer is: No, because this is not 

a situation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're arguing an 

unconstitutional condition, in effect.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think it is an

unconstitutional condition. But I think the bottom line 

is it's not a question of us taking the bad with the 

good. The problem here is that the Federal Government 

has an independent interest, and it is the Federal 

Government's independent interest that is being 

essentially wiped away.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you're right in your 

argument, the Michigan statute provided two things: One 

good for the manufacturer, immunity; two, a 

qualification on it. It seems to me that those two 

can't be unstuck. So to strike out one, as was done in 

the Sixth Circuit case, and not the other is certainly 

not faithful to the Michigan legislature that put these 

two things together.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Ginsburg, that's 

clearly a question of State law. I mean, that's a 

severability issue to be sure. And I -- but I think 

it's not fair to condemn the way the Sixth Circuit 

analyzed this case.

 What the Sixth Circuit said is if it's still 

available to the State to come in after the FDA has both 

found that there has been a material deception of one 

sort or another and that the FDA has decided to withdraw 

the product as a consequence of that, and that -- and 

then State law is allowed to come in and enforce product

liability claims under those circumstances, that the 

legislature would have been perfectly satisfied with 

that arrangement.

 And, candidly, that is precisely what we 

have asked for before both the Second Circuit and this 

Court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, May I ask 

this question that's related to Justice Ginsburg's, but 

not the same. You are saying that the defense is not 

pre-empted; the response to the defense is what is 

pre-empted here.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Correct.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What if you didn't have a 

statute at all and you just had a common law lawsuit in 

which you defended on the ground of compliance with the 

Federal statute shows, the Federal program, shows a lack 

of negligence. And then it then came back with the 

rebuttal: Yes, but your compliance was tainted by 

fraud, the same kind of thing. Would that response be 

pre-empted in a common law lawsuit?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I think the question goes to 

how far that response goes. If you in fact instructed, 

if the trial judge instructed the jury that if it found, 

and then just quoted the language of the statute that 

there's no, then I'd say, yes, that is pre-empted in

precisely the same way.

 And the language the Court used in Buckman 

was "critical element." If the FDA's regulatory 

authority is a critical element of the case, then, yes, 

it is pre-empted.

 Whether or not -- whether evidence by itself 

would be a critical element is harder to tell.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just finish with 

one other thought before --

MR. PHILLIPS: Sure.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: In one of your arguments 

and the government's argument, this is very burdensome 

to the FDA because we have all this litigation. In all 

the years we have had this kind of tort litigation, has 

this issue ever proved to be burdensome to the 

government in any of these -- these attempts to make out 

this charge and this defense?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I mean, the government is 

probably in a better position to evaluate that than I 

am. But, you know --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Because It seems to me 

that we have three or four States that have these 

statutes.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But most States don't have

these statutes. I wonder if the problem is really as 

serious as everybody --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think what the Court 

said in Buckman about that probably applies equally 

here, which is that, rather than look to see whether 

there is, in fact, going to be an interference, we ought 

to recognize that this is a territory that is locked off 

exclusively to the Federal Government's control, and we 

shouldn't -- and there shouldn't be that external pull, 

the extraneous pull, that State law provides under these 

circumstances.

 And the same logic obviously applied here 

would say: We don't wait until there's a serious 

interference with how the FDA is trying to do its job; 

we try to prevent that because there's no -- there's no 

legitimate State interest to be served here.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think there can 

also be the same argument for pre-empting the section, 

the subpart (b) of Michigan statute, the bribery 

exception?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No. I think there's a 

difference between the bribery statute, because again 

that doesn't go to the direct relationship between the 

manufacturer or the seller or the regulated entity and 

the FDA itself. That goes to the relationship

between -- that -- that is governed by a different set 

of laws.

 And I think it's traditionally been the case 

that States are in fact entitled to enforce laws against 

bribery of Federal officials. So I don't think the same 

-- as I say, what I'm looking for here is an extremely 

narrow ruling from this Court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about the defense 

itself, which says that the defense is available if not 

only the drug was approved for safety and efficacy, but 

also if the drug and its labeling were in compliance 

with the FDA's approval at the time the drug left the 

control of the manufacturer?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it wrong to say that 

that's -- you know, that that's interfering with the 

FDA's bailiwick?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think when the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you going to let a jury 

decide that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I'm not going to let a 

jury decide that.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. PHILLIPS: What the district court found 

here, obviously, was that there was compliance, because

the other side didn't challenge the compliance.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Uh-huh.

 MR. PHILLIPS: And, candidly, I think that 

is going to happen 99.999 percent of the time, because 

that's not going to be the issue.

 But, you know, could it eventually be a 

problem if a State jury -- if a State court were to 

decide that there hasn't been compliance? It seems to 

me that's much closer, again, to what you're going to 

take up again next term in Wyeth.

 I think that is a legitimate issue, but it's 

a very different one from the question of how do you 

regulate the relationship between a -- the regulated 

entity and the FDA in terms of the information flow that 

goes between those two entities.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me what you 

are saying is: We're going to win this case even if 

there were no pre-emption.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Even if there is no 

pre-emption on -- on the -- well, I hope I win this case 

regardless.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because they have such a 

burden of proving that the drug wouldn't, in fact, have 

been withdrawn and so forth.

would have won this case on the merits of it?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, clearly we know 

that the FDA didn't withdrew this as a consequence of 

fraud. So in that sense, I suppose you're right, but --

but the reality is that the more fundamental problem 

remains, whether or not these kinds of statutes are 

still out there, are going to create this -- as the 

Court said -- extraneous pull.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Let's just say you use 

something like primary jurisdiction said that they 

actually have to -- to withdraw it. Now, if the FDA --

this is what Justice Stevens said in his concurring 

opinion, which I thought had a lot to be said for it --

that if you had a system where the FDA did withdraw it 

and found fraud, you could ask them, and then nothing 

wrong with the plaintiff going ahead there.

 MR. PHILLIPS: We don't have any problem 

with that, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You don't have any problem.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, we were very --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's not --

MR. PHILLIPS: If the Court wanted to go 

that way, that's fine. I don't think it's presented in 

this case, but that wouldn't present any problem for us.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER,

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. JOSEFFER: Justice Stevens, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Michigan statute presents the same 

conflict this Court found in Buckman, because it 

requires the determination of fraud on the FDA as a 

necessary predicate for establishing liability. And as 

this Court explained in Buckman, the relationship 

between a Federal agency and the entities it regulates 

is inherently Federal. And that's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Does your argument carry to 

the point of the same argument when regulatory 

compliance is raised as a defense, or regulatory 

violation is raised as a ground for liability?

 MR. JOSEFFER: It could depend, because in 

our view what's pre-empted here is a State court 

determination -- under Buckman, what's pre-empted is a

State court determination of whether the FDA was 

defrauded as part of FDA's approval process. So, for 

example, under any circumstance, if a jury is being 

instructed to find whether FDA was defrauded as part of 

the approval process, we'd say there's pre-emption.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, whenever you --

whenever you raise FDA compliance, there is at least the 

potential for a response that they -- they defrauded the 

FDA; they didn't tell them what they should have, and --

you know, vice versa, when -- when it's raised on the 

other side.

 So you always have the potential there for 

-- for just what concerns you, don't you?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well -- and what we would say 

is not pre-empted -- I mean, it's hard to analyze this 

in the abstract without a record as to what a jury was 

actually being asked to do. But if you had a situation 

where it was, say, a design defect claim, and the jury 

was being asked to decide whether this design is 

defective, and that's what it's looking at, and in 

connection with that the jury is instructed that two 

relevant things it can consider are, first, the fact of 

FDA's approval determination and, second, the 

circumstances surrounding that approval determination, 

then that by itself, we would say, is not pre-empted by

Buckman, really for two reasons. One is that 

pre-emption normally applies to legal theories, such as 

claims or defenses, not the mere admissibility of 

evidence; and the second is that FDA's core prerogatives 

here, as the administrator of its own drug approval 

process, are to determine whether it has been defrauded 

and what to do about that. And if the jury is not being 

asked to find those things, but instead is just 

considering evidence in connection with something else, 

we would say that that is what's not pre-empted.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So it's the withdrawal 

element, withdrawal of approval that kills it here?

 MR. JOSEFFER: That's part of it but not all 

of it. I mean, in our view, FDA, as the administrator 

of its own approval process, needs absolute discretion 

to determine what must be submitted to it as part of its 

own approval process, whether it is misled as part of 

its own approval process; whether as you said it would 

have made a different determination in the absence of 

any fraud.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if you get beyond the 

element of what the FDA would have done if it had known, 

then it seems to me you get into an issue which is 

likely to arise by -- whenever, by one side or the 

other, the question of regulatory approval is -- is

offered as a mere matter of evidence.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, if it really is a mere 

matter of evidence, and that's not what the jury is be 

asked to find -- and by the way, it's not at all clear 

that there's -- that there's -- it's settled common law 

tradition in this type of litigation, because the 

context here, where a Federal agency does a 

product-specific approval based in part on a submission 

of information from a manufacturer, that's not a --

that's a question that, first, is of relatively modern 

vintage and, second, is not terribly common. So there's 

not really a uniform, deeply rooted common law tradition 

here. But if all we were talking about was the mere 

admissibility of evidence, we would agree that that was 

not pre-empted. But if you look at --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that's what you've 

got here, except that the mere admissibility of the 

evidence turns in part on what the -- the FDA would have 

done.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, no --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But essentially -- I mean 

you -- the fact is the evidence of the FDA approval is 

made admissible and conclusive, and whether that in fact 

may be admitted is subject to the -- what is it --

clause (b) that you object to, but it comes down to a

question of admissibility.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, it's not because the 

statute expressly requires, as a predicate for 

liability, a finding that the information disclosure 

requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act 

were violated. The jury has to find what was required 

to be submitted to FDA, was it submitted to FDA and was 

FDA misled? And if you had a State administrative 

agency that was set up to tell companies what they must 

or must not submit to FDA, as part of FDA's own approval 

process, the conflict with FDA's ability to administer 

its own approval process would be manifest. And it's no 

different -- as in Regal, the juries instead of agencies 

would be making those determinations in individual 

cases.

 And if I could illustrate the concern which 

this Court explained in Buckman, it's that -- just two 

FDA regulations. The first explains that the technical 

section of a new drug application must provide 

information and data in sufficient detail to permit the 

agency to make a knowledgeable judgment. Now, because 

that is an extremely subjective standard, another FDA 

regulation -- and by the way, these are on pages 142a 

and 186a of the petition appendix -- the second goes on 

to explain that the type and quantity of information

that must be submitted to FDA necessarily depends on the 

particular drug.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this sort of 

general question? Apart from Buckman itself, which 

describes a very serious theoretical problem, as I 

understand it, there must have been a fair amount of 

litigation over the years where the regulatory 

compliance defense was raised or challenged or so forth. 

Is there -- are there any reported cases describing the 

magnitude of the problem to the government, when the --

as the result of debate about these issues?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Nothing that -- that that's 

beyond the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The whole theoretical 

problem.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, it's also a relatively 

new problem, and what -- because -- because it's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The litigation is not, not 

new.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Right, but the 

product-specific approvals, and the desire to probe into 

the circumstances surrounding a product-specific 

approval, is of relatively modern vintage. And Buckman 

itself stands for the proposition that that was not a 

traditional State inquiry at that time. And Buckman

certainly has not encouraged a significant increase in 

such litigation since then. So this is something that 

there's not been a whole lot of.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Leaving aside Buckman, 

what's your strongest case in support of your position? 

Besides that it is a new problem.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, it is. It's a novel 

type of situation where you're -- where you're talking 

about the Federal Government's prerogatives to 

administer its own approval processes. There hasn't 

been a lot of State court litigation on this, in part 

because it's so obviously a Federal matter. I mean, if 

a State supreme court wanted to tell litigants, private 

litigants before this Court what they could and couldn't 

say in their briefs to this Court, the conflict would be 

obvious and therefore the State supreme court would 

never do it. And you have a similar problem here where 

the State is essentially telling companies what they 

must or must not be telling FDA, and there's just an 

obvious intrusion there with FDA's ability to administer 

its own approval process.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Joseffer, let's 

assume that -- that you're right. The Second Circuit, 

because it thought your position it was wrong, never got 

to the severance question. It had been decided by some

intermediate appellate court. But would it not be 

appropriate then to leave it to the Second Circuit on 

remand, if it chooses to use the Michigan certification 

process to say, well, we want to find out from the 

Michigan Supreme Court whether they think that the sweet 

stays, but the bitter goes?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Right. And, I mean, as you 

know, we don't have a position on the State law 

severability question, because our concern here is 

protecting FDA's prerogative to administer its own 

process, not with whether the plaintiff or defendant 

ultimately wins.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It was decided by the Sixth 

Circuit, wasn't it?

 MR. JOSEFFER: It was. And one of the 

things that that brings up, in the Sixth Circuit it was 

actually the plaintiff who was advocating Federal 

pre-emption there, because she thought that she would 

then win on severability analysis and would thereby 

knock out the entire State statute. What that 

underscores is that the unusual Federal pre-emption 

question here is not necessarily one that is even bad 

for plaintiffs. It just protects the important Federal 

prerogative of FDA's ability to administer its own drug 

approval process.

But -- but to answer your question, I mean, 

we don't have a question -- a position on that analysis, 

but I mean, among the procedural options that are 

available, as you said, I mean, you're right. Michigan 

does have a State certification process that, if people 

thought appropriate, could be used.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This -- this tracks 

somewhat Justice Stevens' question. Do we know in this 

case, would this have taken two or three days of 

testimony? Was there discovery? Was it a thousand 

documents? Or three documents?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Right. I mean, this case was 

resolved promptly on a motion to dismiss. But if you 

were going to seriously litigate the question, you would 

have to know -- in order to put this in context, to 

determine things like withholding and materiality --

you'd have to know everything that FDA had before it, 

what FDA thought was required as part of that process. 

You would then have to, I suppose, depose FDA witnesses 

as to what they would have found to be misleading and 

what decisions they might have made in hypothetical 

circumstances.

 And those are incredibly intrusive inquiries 

that, one, distort manufacturers' incentives in dealing 

with FDA in the first place; two, if this was seriously

going to be litigated would require, I assume, quite a 

lot of discovery from FDA, which we would resist, but 

that's not to say that we would necessarily succeed in 

our objections.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask would you -- is 

the bribery exception also pre-empted, do you think?

 MR. JOSEFFER: That's a -- there's a very 

different analysis there.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand. Do you 

think --

MR. JOSEFFER: But we do think that that 

would be pre-empted because -- for a slightly different 

reason, which is that the relationship between -- the 

bribery of a Federal official in connection with his 

Federal duties is obviously a matter of paramount 

Federal concern, and when the -- especially when the 

State is looking at that for purposes of essentially 

second-guessing the validity of a regulatory 

determination that FDA had made --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing the -- supposing 

the official pleaded guilty to bribery. Would it be 

pre-empted then?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Obviously, it still gets much 

closer, and at that point, I'm not sure that it would 

be.

actual experience with any of these cases.

 MR. JOSEFFER: You know, what I was going to 

say is there are a lot of interesting issues surrounding 

this case, but none of them actually seem to be 

presented in this case, because here -- I mean, the 

statute clearly requires a determination of fraud on the 

FDA, including all the elements I mentioned, as a 

necessary predicate for recovery; and, two, FDA has not 

made such a determination.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. ZIEVE: Justice Stevens, and may it 

please the Court:

 Warner-Lambert marketed a defective product. 

It withheld information about the injury the product 

could cause, and the product caused injury to a great 

many patients, including Respondents. They sued 

Warner-Lambert alleging traditional State law claims, 

such as product defect and failure to warn. I'd like 

to begin by explaining why the misrepresentation

exception to the Michigan defense does not implicate the 

concerns that were raised by the Court in Buckman. 

Specifically, the Court in Buckman identified three 

problems or concerns that it thought warranted 

pre-emption in that case: That the claim alleged would 

cause companies to submit too much information and slow 

down the 510(k) process; that the claim alleged might 

cause companies not to submit products for approval 

because of concern about off-label use; and that the 

claim would cause an unwarranted intrusion on the FDA's 

decisionmaking about how to police and enforce fraud 

against it.

 So the question is: Does the Michigan law 

implicate these three concerns any more than traditional 

State tort litigation against a drug company?

 I'll start with what I think are the easy 

ones. For three reasons, the Michigan statute creates 

no incentive for manufacturers to submit unnecessary 

information to the FDA. Unlike the streamlined 510(k) 

clearance process that was at issue in Buckman, in this 

case we have a drug approval. Drugs are required to go 

through a comprehensive pre-market approval process. 

The regulations require submission of, "all available 

information about the safety of a drug, including 

demonstrated or potential adverse effects." I was

quoting from 314.50(b)(5). As Warner-Lambert points out 

in its brief, a typical new drug application can be 

thousands of pages long. So there's not really -- not 

only is there not evidence that this 12-year-old statute 

will lead companies to submit information that the FDA 

doesn't want and doesn't need; but it's really unclear 

what such evidence would be because, after all, 

companies are required to submit all safety information 

to the FDA, and it's safety information that would be 

relevant to a finding under the Michigan exception.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The converse of that is 

that the discovery is exhaustive and quite burdensome. 

I mean, you're trying to say, well, don't worry; there's 

thousands of documents here; they won't be submitting 

anything else. But, on the other hand, that cuts 

against you when we're talking about the intrusiveness 

on the Federal scheme because you have to have Federal 

regulators go back through all of this stuff again.

 MS. ZIEVE: No, Your Honor. The discovery 

in a case like this -- there is no evidence to suggest 

it would be any broader or more burdensome than 

discovery in a typical product liability case against a 

drug company.

 In that regard, Mr. Joseffer is wrong that 

there was no discovery in this case. These cases are

part of a multidistrict litigation and there was a 

significant amount of discovery.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All that makes -- makes it 

worse, in a sense, because what you're saying to me 

anyway -- and you can explain why I'm not right -- that 

all of the three things that you mentioned are only 

aspects of something much more fundamental that 

underlies all these cases -- Medtronics, drugs, all of 

them. You came up and began and said this drug has side 

effects that hurt people. And that's a risk when you 

have a drug, and it's a terrible thing if the drug hurts 

people.

 There's a risk on the other side. There are 

people who are dying or seriously sick, and if you don't 

get the drug to them they die. So there's a problem. 

You've got to get drugs to people and at the same time 

the drug can't hurt them.

 Now, who would you rather have make the 

decision as to whether this drug is, on balance, going 

to save people or, on balance, going to hurt people? An 

expert agency, on the one hand, or 12 people pulled 

randomly for a jury role who see before them only the 

people whom the drug hurt and don't see those who need 

the drug to cure them?

 Now, that it seems to me is Congress's

fundamental choice, and Congress has opted for the 

agency. And that's why we're here --

MS. ZIEVE: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- because you want the 

jury to do it. And it seems to me, reading Buckman, 

that Buckman says the agency should do it. So that's 

what underlies all my reactions to this, and I might as 

well get it right out so that you can answer.

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, I think I have a -- State 

law torts suits aren't seeking to make a determination 

about whether the product should have gone on the 

market. The purpose of the State law tort suit is to 

compensate injured patients. That's a fundamentally 

different role. It's complementary to the FDA's role, 

but it's different. And I think your question, though, 

really goes more to the broader issues that the Court 

will consider next term.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Ms. Zieve, it doesn't 

object to a system where the -- a court -- the State 

would come in and give you your tort suit if it's really 

true that the agency would withdraw this drug. But what 

you want is to be able to convince the jury that there 

was fraud in a situation where the agency doesn't say 

there was fraud. So what you're doing is removing a 

drug from the market that they want out there.

Now, that's the theory of Buckman. The 

theory of Buckman is --

MS. ZIEVE: But that is not --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- they want to save people 

whom you say they shouldn't because the drug shouldn't 

be there. I overstate it slightly. So, explain to me 

why.

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, this case doesn't seek to 

pull Rezulin from the market. Well, first of all, 

Rezulin was pulled from the market seven years ago. But 

that is not the goal of this case. The goal of this 

case is to pay -- to get compensation for people who 

suffered serious liver damage, every single one of them. 

About a third of the patient-respondents died from the 

liver damage caused by Rezulin, and what they're seeking 

here is not a regulatory remedy; they're seeking damages 

and compensation for that.

 And the -- the place where we started with 

the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your premise still is, is 

that the drug should not have been marketed, or is that 

your premise?

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, under Michigan law, the

different, but the premise on which you operate is that 

the drug should not have been sold.

 MS. ZIEVE: The -- if I can just back up to 

-- to the structure of the Michigan statute --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You can back up as long as 

you want as long as you come forward and answer.

 (Laughter.)

 MS. ZIEVE: I promise will.

 (Laughter.)

 MS. ZIEVE: The Michigan statute takes as 

its starting point the notion that Federal approval is 

reliable evidence that a drug company has satisfied the 

duty -- State law duties of care owed to patients, and 

then it says: But there are a couple of situations 

where that reliability is drawn into question.

 So, if the company bribes the FDA or the if 

the company misrepresented important information to the 

FDA, then the approval is no longer a sufficient basis 

on which we can just say that approval in and of itself 

means that the manufacturer satisfied State law duties.

 And so, the -- the purpose of the finding 

about whether there was misrepresentation and what the 

results of it might have been is not to police 

enforcement with FDA requirements, and it is not to 

force the drug off the market. It is only a hurdle that

the plaintiff has to get past so it can litigate -- he 

or she can litigate her State law claim the same way 

plaintiffs will be litigating those claims, and did 

litigate those claims, with respect to Rezulin in States 

across the country.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Aren't you going to tell 

this jury that the drug should not have been on the 

market?

 MS. ZIEVE: Yes. In Michigan they will have 

to present evidence that if the company had been honest 

with the FDA, the product wouldn't have been approved. 

The discovery in this case shows that it doesn't -- at 

least in this case, that wouldn't present a big problem.

 First of all, there is evidence in this 

case, testimony from the medical officer who reviewed 

the information, that Rezulin would not have been 

approved as a standalone therapy, that it is infused 

without insulin or another drug, if the company hadn't 

lied about -- withheld adverse event reports.

 But certainly in the typical case a lot of 

the information that comes out with respect to what went 

on before the FDA, not only is it submitted in product 

liability cases in the first instance by the 

manufacturer to show all of the hurdles they had to go 

through to get on the market, doesn't that show our

product was safe, but a lot of it you can get in 

discovery from the company, themselves, as happened in 

this case. A lot of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought under the 

Michigan scheme you don't have to show that. You just 

show approval, and that's the end of the case in 

Michigan.

 MS. ZIEVE: There are no Michigan cases 

explaining just what you need to show to satisfy the 

defense, so it is unclear whether you have to show that 

you met -- if it is the right chemical formula, with the 

label originally approved, or does compliance with 

approval mean that you also had to show -- one of the 

terms of approval is that you continued to update your 

label when you become aware of new safety information; 

would you have to show -- a manufacturer have to show 

that to show that the defense was satisfied.

 There's no cases under Michigan law which 

tell us --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that you 

could prove that the -- an exception to the defense 

applies and still lose your lawsuit?

 MS. ZIEVE: Absolutely, we could. Showing 

that the exception applies is just the first step to 

being able to litigate this case the way plaintiffs

litigated these cases in California, and Illinois, and 

New York, and other States.

 There was Rezulin litigation throughout the 

country. And, again, the point about discovery is that 

the broad discovery that was done, a lot from 

Warner-Lambert, some from the FDA, that was no different 

discovery really than would be required under Michigan. 

It's all there.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Would you explain why you 

think Mr. Joseffer was wrong when he argued that having 

a jury decide whether the FDA would have approved the 

drug or would have withdrawn it from the market if 

additional or different information had been supplied is 

incorrect?

 Doesn't that -- wouldn't that very seriously 

interfere with what the FDA is doing?

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, of course, in the specific 

facts of this case it wouldn't, because Rezulin is off 

the market and unapproved. But even as a general matter 

it doesn't affect FDA's regulation because, as I said in 

response to Justice Stevens, the effect of making that 

showing and the jury agreeing that the product wouldn't 

have been approved is -- there's no regulatory effect. 

The effect is that the plaintiff can then go ahead and 

litigate her case like she could in any other State.

And that's why -- that's because what 

Michigan is doing is not policing enforcement. It is 

just defining the parameters of the compliance --

JUSTICE ALITO: There wouldn't be discovery 

of internal processes within the FDA? There wouldn't be 

experts testifying about what the FDA would or would not 

have done?

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, the parties may seek 

discovery. There hasn't been enough Michigan litigation 

for us to know exactly how it would work; but, 

certainly, the courts in Michigan should be trusted to 

use their discretion to keep discovery under control as 

they do in every case. The Rezulin litigation --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't -- in this case 

one of the charges was that the original FDA examiner 

had recommended against approval for this drug, and then 

something happened inside the FDA, and that examiner was 

taken off the matter, and another one who approved it 

was put on?

 Isn't that the kind of thing that the FDA 

would want to police itself and not have State courts 

look into?

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, those are some of the 

background facts that happened here. But I don't think 

those are the facts that go to a showing of what the FDA

would have done if Warner-Lambert had made honest 

disclosures, because actually those facts tend to 

suggest that the FDA did know what was going on.

 But later the second medical officer, the 

one who did recommend approval -- the approval came in 

two stages. One was for use as a combination therapy 

with insulin and another drug called Metformin, and 

later there was an approval for use of Rezulin on its 

own.

 That is the use that happened to affect all 

of my clients, and that's the use where we already have 

a medical officer who testified that the agency would 

not have approved for that use if the company hadn't 

withheld safety information.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what evidence would 

you introduce to prove the -- to prove the exception if 

the Second Circuit's decision stands?

 MS. ZIEVE: Deposition testimony from that 

medical officer, for example. There are e-mails. We 

cited a couple of e-mails in the red brief of things 

that were stated at the time: One an e-mail to 

Warner-Lambert and one from a medical officer to his 

superior talking about the way in which Warner-Lambert 

made it harder -- to be kind to -- for them to assess 

what the true safety profile of the drug was.

There is -- as I said, there was a very 

large amount of Rezulin discovery done in the MDL, most 

of which is under a protective order. So I don't know 

everything that's in there, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The question is: Would 

we be disrupting the FDA by taking depositions of 

examiners to find out what went on at the FDA?

 MS. ZIEVE: No more so than product 

liability litigation in any other State. As I said, the 

deposition that happened in this case, the plaintiff's 

committee asked -- they negotiated discovery with the 

FDA in the Rezulin cases in general, not looking at 

Michigan specifically at all. They got some discovery 

from the FDA and the deposition of the medical officer.

 There's also a lot of information about 

approved drugs that the FDA posts as a matter of course 

on its website, including the medical officer reviews 

that form the basis for the approval decision.

 But even in other cases, for instance, the 

Vioxx MDL that was pending in Louisiana, the -- in that 

case the FDA wasn't as interested in negotiating, and 

there was motions to suppress and a motion to compel. 

And the judge had to decide whether to allow an FDA 

medical officer to be deposed; and in that case, did.

 There are other cases where the FDA has not

wanted discovery and has successfully opposed it. The 

FDA has regulations about that, and there's no evidence 

that it's burdening the FDA to cooperate to some degree 

in discovery or the judges are allowing plaintiffs to 

overrun the FDA with requests they can't handle. But, 

more importantly --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume -- I assume -- you 

don't stop between sentences, so I hate to interrupt 

you.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that if this drug 

were still on the market, you could bring forward the 

information that you have alluded to about the 

withholding of necessary data by Warner-Lambert, and the 

FDA would certainly be able to consider that and decide 

whether sanctions were necessary, withdrawing of the 

drug was necessary.

 In this case, the drug has already been 

withdrawn. So I assume the FDA has at least a reduced 

incentive to go into these questions. I guess they 

still would want to go into them if Warner-Lambert were 

really a bad actor. They could impose some sanctions, 

couldn't they, even though the drug was already 

withdrawn?

 MS. ZIEVE: I don't know if they still

could, but presumably sometime in the past they could 

have.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think we could have 

two different rules: One for drugs that are still out 

there and one for drugs that have since been withdrawn? 

Because I frankly see little incentive for the FDA, you 

know, to go back over past mistakes. The drug now 

having been withdrawn, it doesn't matter.

 But if the drug was still out there, it 

seems to me you could come forward, and I would be much 

less sympathetic to what you're trying to do. You could 

trust the FDA to do the job.

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, the job the FDA is going 

to do, even if it agrees with a plaintiff, is to 

sanction the company, perhaps, or to ask it for 

different information. It does have the ability to 

withdraw approval --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but once it sanctions 

the Plaintiff, the Government can't make the argument 

you are interfering; you are second-guessing the FDA.

 The FDA would have said: You didn't give us 

information that was necessary; and had we known this, 

we wouldn't have gone ahead.

 MS. ZIEVE: There's no way for a plaintiff 

to compel the FDA to look into a situation of a

manufacturer being dishonest for the -- or to -- even if 

the FDA starts a process for a plaintiff to compel the 

agency to make a finding that the company 

withheld material information, and we would not have 

approved it otherwise.

 And even if the agency chose to do that, it 

wouldn't be of any help to the plaintiff because the 

plaintiff's family is seeking compensation because the 

breadwinner is dead, or the person is impeded in their 

ability to make a living in the future and has huge 

medical bills now.

 And the FDA's finding that, yes, the company 

really acted badly isn't going to do anything to help 

that -- that family.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but it will lead to 

the drug being withdrawn, in which case there may be 

just as many people on the other side who are dying, 

dead, no breadwinner, et cetera, because they didn't get 

a necessary drug. And that's why what worries me is 

what happens if the jury is wrong?

 You are absolutely right when you say you 

cannot make the FDA go into this matter and withdraw a 

drug; and they are absolutely right when they say we 

cannot promise you that juries will be right.

JUSTICE BREYER: So the the question is: 

Who is more likely to be right?

 MS. ZIEVE: With respect, I don't think 

that's the question, because if the jury -- if a 

Michigan jury is wrong about what would have happened if 

Warner-Lambert hadn't acted so badly, the result is that 

Ms. Kent and the other Plaintiffs get to litigate their 

claims. The result is not -- there is no regulatory --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then you think they should 

be able to litigate a claim where the FDA has approved a 

drug.

 Now, is that the law in most places? Where 

the FDA has approved a drug for use and the doctor 

follows the label and the label is all okay, is it the 

case that somebody can come in and say, despite that, 

this drug is on balance harmful, and I get compensation?

 This is a serious question. I'm not sure 

how it works.

 MS. ZIEVE: That is the law in every State.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's been contested, 

and we are going to hear that case next term.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the next issue.

 MS. ZIEVE: That's right.

JUSTICE BREYER: I see.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- at least since the 

1930's, State tort litigation of the very kind that 

Justice Breyer has described has gone on. Isn't that 

so? That you -- even though the FDA has approved a 

drug, an injured party can say this was a defective 

drug, and the manufacturer says regulatory compliance. 

That's a defense. And you would say it's a defense, but 

not a conclusive defense.

 MS. ZIEVE: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's how -- that's how 

MS. ZIEVE: Yes. The FDA approval, Federal 

approval, and State tort actions have co-existed since 

1938.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? That's where I am 

missing you. Why, then, does Michigan even have this 

thing? In other words, why -- you are saying if they 

didn't have it at all, you would go ahead and bring your 

tort action.

 MS. ZIEVE: That's right. Michigan chose --

JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.

 MS. ZIEVE: -- to -- not to create a new 

claim as the plaintiffs tried to do in Buckman, but, 

rather, to take a traditional claim and restrict

plaintiff's ability to prevail on it.

 This is not an expansion of State tort law. 

It is a considerable narrowing of State tort law.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, would you say that 

my characterization of it when Mr. Phillips was 

presenting his case, that this is an invigorated 

regulatory compliance defense, that it is more 

favorable, far more favorable, to the manufacturer than 

the standard regulatory compliance because it says that 

the manufacturer is immune, totally immune, unless --

and then the exception that we are debating here.

 But it is a deliberately pro-manufacturer 

measure. It gives the manufacturer an immunity that the 

regulatory compliance defense does not.

 MS. ZIEVE: And I would go even further. 

It's not just pro-manufacturer. This statute is the 

most deferential to the FDA of any State tort law in the 

country. Other States will allow a manufacturer to 

present evidence of compliance to show the product 

wasn't defective, and that's non-dispositive evidence in 

almost every State.

 And then a plaintiff can come back and say: 

Oh, but look, they didn't comply in these ways. And 

that wouldn't be dispositive either in most States.

 But only in Michigan not only is the

manufacturer's compliance defense dispositive in the 

majority of cases, but the evidence of non-compliance 

isn't even allowed as a rebuttal unless the plaintiff 

can show that it actually was a material non-compliance 

that would have made a difference.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And in your view could a 

State prohibit introduction of evidence by the defendant 

that the drug was approved by the FDA?

 MS. ZIEVE: Only to the extent that they 

simply thought it wasn't relevant. And there are 

States that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And all they say in the 

statute: We just think -- they just think this is 

irrelevant.

 MS. ZIEVE: Sure. And there are States that 

don't allow compliance --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I don't think that's 

consistent with your position. There's no doubt about 

that.

 MS. ZIEVE: There are States that don't 

allow compliance evidence if the plaintiff shows 

material misrepresentation, "material" being that it 

could have -- could have influenced the agency without a 

finding that it did or would have influenced the agency, 

but just that it was pertinent information.

And in those cases, this is discussed in 

common -- either the restatement. In such a case some 

States would say that the compliance evidence then can't 

come in. And it is sort of the same theory as 

Michigan's, but just not as strict against the 

plaintiffs, that if you can't trust the -- the 

compliance evidence isn't relevant. It's not meaningful 

if you can't trust it. Because the --

JUSTICE BREYER: So to me, which is a good 

answer, is you are saying: Look at the basic tort 

system here. And if you can do that, you can do this. 

Is that -- do you see where I'm --

MS. ZIEVE: If -- if the traditional tort 

system as it exists in most every State is not 

pre-empted, then Michigan's statute is not pre-empted.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Zieve, how many 

States have a statute like Michigan's?

 MS. ZIEVE: The Michigan statute is unique 

with respect to the finding -- the requirement that 

there be a finding of how the FDA would have acted if 

the manufacturer had not made certain representations.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No other State does that?

 MS. ZIEVE: Texas has a similar statute 

except it doesn't have that last element. And one of 

the questions on severability is whether -- if you think

just that element is pre-empted, whether you can --

whether Michigan would want to sever that one element.

 And then there are a number of States that 

limit punitive damages liability but along the lines of 

Texas, not Michigan. So, again, that last element is 

not required.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But was there any 

experience with this in Michigan? How many years was it 

in operation before the Sixth Circuit decision?

 MS. ZIEVE: I believe it went into effect in 

March of '96. So, seven years.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have there been many 

trials to test this theory that it would be disruptive, 

that --

MS. ZIEVE: We were unable to find any 

reported cases or Westlaw discussion of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the Sixth Circuit 

case? It must have involved this, no?

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, in the Sixth Circuit the 

plaintiff said: We can't prove the exception, but it is 

pre-empted and not severable. So we -- so that the the 

statute would fall.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. What is your 

position on severability? Why shouldn't we -- you know, 

we usually accept the circuit court's determination as

to what the State law is. Michigan is in the Sixth 

Circuit. And I think it's overwhelmingly likely that 

the Second Circuit would defer to the Sixth Circuit's 

view. Don't you think?

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, in footnote 4 of the 

Second Circuit's decision, Justice Calabrezze points out 

that certification to the Michigan Supreme Court would 

also be an option, and an option that the court doesn't 

-- that court didn't even get to.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The discussion in the 

Sixth Circuit was not very extensive on this point, on 

this --

MS. ZIEVE: No, it wasn't. And this Court 

has no -- has no practice with respect to deferring to 

State law questions that were decided by courts of 

appeals in a different case. That is, this case didn't 

come to the Court from the Sixth Circuit.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I want to be sure I 

understand something. In the other case, the plaintiff 

is the one who argued there was pre-emption, and the 

whole statute was invalid, and not the defendant.

 MS. ZIEVE: That's right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I see. I missed that.

 MS. ZIEVE: Yes. It was a good try. But I

tied to the reason --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So the defendants kind of 

take the risk when they make the argument they are 

making. They have a chance to either lose or win.

 MS. ZIEVE: Well, that's right. I mean, I 

think the fact that Michigan is such a pro-manufacturer 

State --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If there is no 

severability, the defense is gone, period.

 MS. ZIEVE: That's right.

 The -- and the reason for severability, 

though, was quite tied to the whole reason why we think 

there's not preemption in the first place, which is that 

the statute really needs to be looked at as a whole. 

You can't -- you can't understand what the exception is 

trying to accomplish without putting it in the context 

of the statute. After all, it is -- it's subparagraph 

(8) of subsection (5) of the Michigan statute.

 If the Court has no further questions,

Hopefully, I'll give you back some of that time, so you 

can get to lunch.

 Justice Kennedy, I think the best case for 

us without Buckman would have been Hoyle versus United 

Technologies. That's a case involving again a uniquely 

federal interest. And the advantage of that particular 

case is it also reflects that pre-emption is not an all 

or nothing proposition. You can preempt out the 

specific parts that is offensive and retain the part of 

State law that is not offensive. And that's precisely 

what we're trying to do in this case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There was special 

consideration because of military considerations.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think that's what 

made it a uniquely Federal interest. But I don't know 

that it's any more a uniquely Federal interest than this 

one. At least this is the way the Court has analyzed 

both of them in Buckman.

 Justice Ginsburg, with respect to 

severability, I think, frankly, the Second Circuit 

already answered the question. They said that we would 

defer to the Sixth Circuit under Factors and then 

analyze certification. And it concluded that, given the 

clarity of the Sixth Circuit's decision in Garcia, that 

there's nothing left to be decided on that issue.

MR. PHILLIPS: I would suggest you read the 

Petition Appendix 14a, where it says on the one hand, 

under Factors we are bound to follow Garcia's 

conclusions as to questions of Michigan State law, and 

then the footnote reflects that the Sixth Circuit in 

Garcia had clearly decided the severability issue here. 

So, frankly, if --

it isn't a very thoroughly reasoned discussion. It's a 

is very -- it's just one paragraph.

 MR. PHILLIPS: To be sure. But on the other 

hand, it does seem to me that it spoke specifically to 

the issue and recognized the right outcome.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, because it is 

odd -- I mean, it is odd that you'd have a statute that 

says: Manufacturer, we're going to give you immunity, 

but there's an exception. They seem so tied together

the sweet and get rid of the bitter. And it seems to me 

that there is -- that there was no discussion of that in 

the Sixth Circuit.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, but there is a discussion 

of that in the Sixth Circuit decision. Garcia 

specifically deals with that, because it says the bitter 

that you have to take is if the FDA in fact makes all of 

the very specific and intricate findings that are 

required by the exception and concludes that the product 

should be withdrawn for fraud, then in fact you get the 

bitter, which is that the lawsuit goes forward under 

those circumstances, and that that's the reasonable 

compromise that the State legislature had in mind or 

would have been satisfied with.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is 

whether the legislature would have passed the statute 

that it did if in a case like this one the manufacturer 

could have the immunity without the exception.

 MR. PHILLIPS: All I'm saying is I think the 

Court addressed that in Garcia and specifically 

concluded that the legislature in fact would have passed 

that; And that traditionally, the Second Circuit would 

defer, as would this Court.

not to change their mind. I mean, they did say that 

they're bound by this by Garcia as to questions of State 

law.

 Justice Scalia, I'd like to answer your 

question about if we were going forward with respect to 

withdrawal as opposed to looking back. I mean, the FDA 

still has the authority to order disgorgement, to order 

restitution for victims. I think the notion that the 

FDA is indifferent to claims of fraud is just -- is 

flatly offensive. The reality is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Does restitution for 

victims include damages?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, whatever injuries --

yeah, I mean, I don't know exactly what the sweep of 

restitution would be, but disgorgement of profits would 

certainly provide a mechanism for providing --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you're not talking

about profits when you have an injured -- a patient who 

died as a result of malpractice or something. That's 

not disgorgement of profits. That's damages.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I understand that. All I'm 

suggesting, Justice Stevens, is that there are remedial 

mechanisms still available to the FDA if in fact it 

concluded that there was some problem, and that those --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It couldn't give recovery 

to a class action of a couple of hundred plaintiffs who 

were injured, could it? No such remedy under the FDA, 

or am I wrong on that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, as I understood the 

FDA's position is that they have pretty broad remedial 

authority and that it extends to some form of 

restitution to the victims. So I --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The government told us in 

its brief that the FDA has no system for addressing 

public complaints -- this was in their brief at page 

24 -- because that would divert attention from their 

primary mission. So there's no action for fraud that 

one can bring to the FDA.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, there is a 

provision for citizen petitions that exists, that's 

cited. So, yes, there is a mechanism.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But The FDA doesn't have

to do anything about it?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. It entertains it. 

In point of fact, there was a petition filed by Public 

Citizen to withdraw Rezulin in this specific case, and 

it was reviewed and it was rejected for exactly the 

reason Justice Breyer identified, because if you took it 

off the market, people would die. That was the concern 

that drove the FDA to say: We're not going to do that 

under these circumstances.

 If there are no further questions, Your 

Honors.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The case is taken under 

advisement.

 (Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
