CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 11-864, Comcast 

Corporation v. Behrend. 

Mr. Estrada. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL ESTRADA 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. ESTRADA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

The Third Circuit held in this case that the 

assessment of the adequacy of expert evidence offered in 

support of class certification is a merits question that 

has no place in the class certification inquiry. 

According to the Third Circuit and to the 

plaintiffs in this Court, what is sufficient is for the 

proponents of class certification to point to some 

abstract methodology, such as econometrics or regression 

analysis, that conceivably might be applied to the 

problem at hand in a way in which, in the fullness of 

time, will evolve into admissible evidence by the time 

of the class trial. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Estrada, you are 

limiting your argument to the determination of damages, 

as I understand it.

MR. ESTRADA: I think you limited my 

argument to determination of damages, Justice Ginsburg. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because the -- because 

the Third Circuit agreed that, as far as any antitrust 

impact --

MR. ESTRADA: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that could be 

established on a class basis. 

MR. ESTRADA: We -- we, obviously -- as is 

obvious from our cert petition, we do not agree with 

that. For purposes of inquiring into the damages 

question in this Court, I think we have to assume that 

that is so. I think it doesn't change the 

outcome with --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why -- why not? 

Because, generally -- and at least it's my impression --

that in class certifications, if the liability question 

can be adjudicated on a class basis, then the damages 

question may be adjudicated individually. 

Take a -- take a Title VII case. A 

liability -- a pattern of practice of discrimination, 

therefore, liability, but damages can be assessed on an 

individual basis. So why isn't bifurcation possible 

here?

MR. ESTRADA: Well, let me make two points 

in response to that question, Justice Ginsburg: One 

about what the legal standards are, and -- you know, the 

second one, which is as important, about what the record 

in this case is. 

With respect to the first point, what the 

rule asks us to look at is not questions of damages 

versus liability, but whether the common questions 

predominate over those that are individual to the class 

members. 

I don't disagree, and it is not my position 

today that there may be cases in which individual 

damages questions are consistent with class 

certification. But as the lower courts have recognized, 

it is not the case that all damages questions may -- may 

remain individual consistently with class certification. 

Indeed, the 1966 advisory notes expressly 

say that questions of damages with respect to class 

members may or may not predominate in cases like this; 

i.e., antitrust class actions. Let --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Estrada, doesn't 

Justice Ginsburg's question actually point out that 

the -- the law that both district court and the 

circuit court used in this case was actually quite 

favorable to you?

Unlike some courts, both the district court 

and the circuit court said that the plaintiffs needed to 

show that there was a class-wide measurement of damages. 

And then in addition, both courts said, really, it 

was -- the burden was on the plaintiffs to demonstrate 

that that class-wide measure of damages existed. 

Now, I understand that you have problems 

with the way in which the plaintiffs met that burden. 

You say that they didn't meet that burden. But it seems 

to me that the legal standard that was used was exactly 

the legal standard that you wanted, that the plaintiffs 

had to come in and show, by a preponderance, that they 

had a class-wide way to measure damages in this case. 

MR. ESTRADA: I don't think that's right, 

Justice Kagan. I think we can have a healthy debate 

about whether the district court did what you just 

finished saying. I think there can be no debate that 

the court of appeals did so because, repeatedly, 

throughout its opinion, said that the questions as to 

the adequacy of whether they had complied with the 

Hydrogen Peroxide Standard was a merits question that 

was for later adjudication in this case. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, here's what the 

district court said. "The experts' opinions raise 

substantial issues of fact and credibility that we are

required to resolve to decide the pending motion." That 

is the motion for class certification. 

"Having rigorously analyzed the experts' 

reports, we conclude that the class has met its burden 

to demonstrate that the element of antitrust impact is 

capable of proof at trial through evidence that is 

common to the class and that there is a common 

methodology available to measure and quantify damages on 

a class-wide basis." 

So that seems to me exactly what you say 

they should have done. Now, you disagree with their 

ultimate determination, but not with the statement of 

the law. 

MR. ESTRADA: Well, I think that it is true 

that our position in the district court was that 

Hydrogen Peroxide controlled and that the district court 

correctly stated the holding of the Third Circuit ruling 

in that case. 

Beyond that, I don't think that we do agree, 

because, in the Third Circuit, once the case got there, 

we got a rule of law saying that, although this court 

prescribed the rule amendment, 23(f), precisely to 

enable courts of appeals to review whether the district 

court got it right for important policy questions, that 

the job of the court of appeals under 23(f) can be fully

discharged by saying that providence will provide; we'll 

think about it in the morning. And that is not 

consistent with the proposition that the correct law was 

applied in the lower courts. 

Furthermore, although the district court did 

enounce the correct standard in reflecting the holding 

of Hydrogen Peroxide, it is far from apparent -- and 

this is part of our point to the Third Circuit -- excuse 

me -- to the Third Circuit -- which was not actually 

heard on the merits, that what he did was different from 

simply saying that econometrics and regression analysis 

are well-established methodologies for dealing with 

problems of this kind. 

And I will ask you to -- to look at the top 

of page 145 of the Pet. App., where you can look at 

discussions -- no, I'm sorry, it's 131, in footnote 

24 -- where the district court made clear that his 

understanding of the capable class-wide proof involved 

the inquiry whether the plaintiffs actually had evidence 

that reflected the methodologies that had been used in 

this case -- in these kinds of cases. 

He says, "It is undisputed that multiple 

regression analysis is an acceptable and widely 

recognized statistical tool for cases of this kind." 

So at a very general level, I don't have a

disagreement with you that, in many cases where there is 

error, the district court started out with the right 

foot. I don't agree with you that the correct standard 

either was applied by the district court or was even 

attempted by the court of appeals. 

Now, if we were to go to the merits of the 

question -- and to answer -- you know, the second part 

of the question that I started out with 

Justice Ginsburg -- keep in mind that, even on the 

assumption that the district court accepted that there 

was common class proof of antitrust impact, that is not 

the same as accepting -- and I don't think the district 

court accepted -- that there was common class-wide proof 

that the impact for every individual was the same. 

And that is a key point about what the 

theory of impact here was. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't have to be the 

same for every member of the class. As the dissenting 

judge pointed out, you can have subclasses. 

MR. ESTRADA: Well -- and I'm happy to also 

deal with that question. There are cases, indeed, in 

which -- you know, the variances of the classes can be 

dealt with, with subclasses. No one on the plaintiffs' 

side has actually asserted here that the record would 

allow this. And Mr. Jordan pointed out there is

considerable basis for skepticism in thinking that that 

could ever be accomplished because we are talking about 

649 franchise areas with different competitive 

conditions. 

But if you go back to -- to the theory of 

impact -- and the theory of impact was that RCN, this 

putative overbuilder, was -- you know, the little engine 

that could, that it was going to radiate out to the 

entire DMA area and completely overbuild the area. So 

the theory of impact was, if you drop a stone in the 

water, you are going to have ripples all the way out, so 

you have ripples as to every member of the class. It 

doesn't mean that every ripple is the same. 

So -- so that the key question for the 

damages issue in front of you now is whether what 

McClave came up with was an adequate methodology for 

measuring the size of the ripple --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I did -- are there cases 

in the -- in the ordinary course of class actions -- I 

know they are all different -- where the district court 

can find that common questions do predominate, without 

addressing the question whether damages can be proven on 

a class-wide basis? Or are they always interlinked? 

MR. ESTRADA: No, I think the text of 

(b)(20) -- of (b)(3) expressly requires that questions,

whether they be damages or liability that are common to 

the class, predominate over those that are individual as 

to class members. And I -- I fully accept -- and I am 

not arguing -- that the mere fact that there may be 

individual damages questions precludes class 

certification. 

I am actually arguing for the flip side of 

that issue, which is that just because it -- it may not 

be preclusive in certain cases doesn't mean that it is 

preclusive in no case. 

I would refer the Court to the Fifth 

Circuit's opinion by Judge Garwood in the Bell v. AT&T 

case, which was, like this, an antitrust case, where the 

Fifth Circuit acknowledged that, in many of these cases, 

it's almost hornbook law that there may be individual 

issues that would not preclude class cert, but that 

there are certain cases in which -- you know, the theory 

of injury and -- and the proof that would be needed to 

make it out is so sui generous and individualized --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I completely agree 

with hornbook law. Three pipe manufacturers get 

together and, in January, fix their prices, all right? 

MR. ESTRADA: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Fourteen wholesalers want 

to show that, and each has different damages because

they bought different amounts of pipe. 

MR. ESTRADA: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Hornbook law: Certify the 

class and leave the damages issues for later. 

MR. ESTRADA: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: This case, this case, 

hornbook law: Section 2 forbids monopolization. It is 

absolutely clear Comcast has that power. That's why 

they're -- that's why they're regulated. And, indeed, 

they engage in things that show that they did not 

achieve that through skill, foresight, and industry. 

What things? And now, we have a list of 

four. And the district court says exactly what? If we 

prove monopolization, which is relevant to all these 

people in the class, then what we do is we later look 

into how much that monopolization raised the prices 

above competitive levels. And I offer a model to look 

at the competitive levels and look at what happened over 

here, and there we are, it will help. Okay? 

Now, hornbook law, whether that's so or not 

so is a matter for later, but see first if there is 

liability. Okay. That's their argument. What's the 

answer? 

MR. ESTRADA: Well, I mean, the answer is --

I will take your first example, and, in fact, I was

going to give -- you know, the example of a case that I 

had that was similar where -- you know, three plastic 

cup manufacturers met in -- you know, some airport and 

fixed -- you know, the prices. 

Now, this is like saying you fixing -- you 

know, the price of widgets. There is a preexisting 

but-for world, and the question as to who bought what 

when is not really a question of adjudication, but of 

computation. And those are the types of cases where the 

courts say that the individual damages questions really 

do not preclude a -- a certification. 

Now, your second example may or may not be 

suitable for class treatment. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, here, since what they 

are saying is they have two theories, Section 1, the 

agreements to keep other people out of this area are 

unlawful in themselves. Question 2 is whether they 

contribute to monopolization. Okay? 

MR. ESTRADA: No, but -- but the question --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's the legal issue 

of liability. Now, if they're right, why isn't the 

measure of damages just what you said? We look to the 

people who are subject to the monopoly power, and we 

work out how much above the competitive level they had 

to pay.

MR. ESTRADA: But the legal --

JUSTICE BREYER: Some paid some; some paid 

another. We have some experts in to try to make that 

computation. Sounds the same to me. 

MR. ESTRADA: No, but it isn't because one 

key point that is missing from the hypothetical, 

Justice Breyer, is exactly what the theory of liability 

that is present in this case is, as the case comes to 

the Court. They had four theories of possible --

JUSTICE BREYER: I saw the four theories, 

and it seems to me that we are now on the theory of 

the -- one of the pieces of exclusionary conduct was 

agreement through various mergers, et cetera, that 

potential competitors would not come in and compete. 

Now, I don't know why the judge struck out 

the other one, the number 2. But number 3 and Number 4, 

I can see it. But on monopolization theory, that's not 

relevant to damages. Throughout, we assume that the 

regulator is doing a terrible job; otherwise, the prices 

wouldn't be so high in the first place. 

But what's the difference in this case? 

just didn't hear it, and I put that to show you how it 

seemed to me there is very similar. The difference --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is? 

MR. ESTRADA: -- basically starts with the 

actual point of antitrust law, whether these people 

are -- actually are potential competitors. It's not 

actually relevant to the class certifications that we 

face today. 

But I don't accept, for present purposes or 

for later, that these people that already have different 

clusters of cable service that were simply aggregated in 

these transactions actually were actual potential 

competitors. They were not --

liability. 

MR. ESTRADA: Well, you are right --

JUSTICE BREYER: You have the right to prove 

that they weren't, fine. 

MR. ESTRADA: I just said that. But the 

point is that, as the case comes to the -- to the Court, 

the question is whether the class that was certified by 

the district court and validated in its own way by the 

court of appeals is one that is consistent and fits 

reliably with the legal theory that the plaintiffs are 

allowed to pursue --

something so contrary to the facts, but the fact is that

theory they are permitted to pursue. It is that this 

overbuilder, RCN, would have radiator -- radiated out 

through the DMA area. 

Now, you may think that they should have

1 been allowed to pursue some other different theory. 

2 It's not the case that you have in front of you. And 

3 the fact is that -- that -- that as the case comes to 

4 the Court, the theory that remains is based on the 

proposition that RCN was going to be the overbuilder 

6 that -- that was going to impact prices. Well, two --

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. --

8  MR. ESTRADA: If I could just finish? 

9  Two things follow from that. You know, the 

first one which is directly pertinent to the issue here 

11 is that the McClave model purported to compute damages 

12 that were not limited to overbuilding and that, in fact, 

13 expressly measured overbuilding only as to 5 out of the 

14 16 counties. The damage model just does not fit the 

legal theory that stays in the case. 

16  The second aspect of it is that, as a 

17 question of the factual fit with the record in the case, 

18 the transactions that added the largest number of 

19 subscribers here occurred in 2000 and very early 2001. 

The record in this case includes public announcements by 

21 RCN, repeated by the FCC in its competition review, that 

22 they were not going to franchise any new franchises. So 

23 there is a basic question of lack of fit between the ipse 

24 dixit of the expert and -- you know, the record in this case.

case comes to the Court, I guess I wonder why any of 

this is relevant. You mentioned earlier -- you 

mentioned earlier that we reformulated the question 

presented in this case. And we reformulated in a way 

which said that what we wanted to talk about was whether 

a district court at a class certification stage has to 

conduct a Daubert inquiry, in other words, has to decide 

on the admissibility of expert testimony relating to 

class-wide damages. 

And -- you know, it would not be crazy to 

surmise that we reformulated the question because we 

wanted to present -- we wanted to decide a legal 

question, rather than a question about who was right as 

to this particular expert's report and how strong it 

was. And it turns out that, as to that legal question, 

your clients waived their -- their argument that this 

was inadmissible evidence. 

So -- so what do we do in that circumstance? 

MR. ESTRADA: Well, I don't agree with you 

that we waived. And -- you know, we covered this in, I 

think, three or pages in the reply brief, with all of 

the citations as to how we challenged the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you challenged the 

probity, Mr. Estrada. You said Comcast said it had no 

objection to McClave's qualification as an expert. So

what you were talking about was the probity of this 

report, not the admissibility. 

MR. ESTRADA: No, that is not right, Justice 

Ginsburg. Daubert and its progeny really encompasses 

three distinct prongs. One of them is, of course, the 

qualifications of the expert. The second one is the --

the -- the reliability of the methodology. And the 

third is fit. 

And all we said at the -- at the class 

hearing is that we had no objection to the proposition 

that these people have Ph.D.'s, which indeed they do. 

But the issue still was, both in the district court and 

in the court of appeals, one that we urged that the 

methodology was not relevant and did not --

JUSTICE KAGAN: The district court, 

Mr. Estrada, clearly understood you to be making an 

argument about weight and not about admissibility. And 

indeed, the district court in open court -- and -- and 

it's in the transcript -- suggests that it's doing 

something different from holding a Daubert hearing, 

explains how it's different from holding a Daubert 

hearing, and both lawyers agree to that statement. 

MR. ESTRADA: Well, but I think we -- we 

agree that he needed to conduct more than a Daubert 

hearing because we agree with the holding of the Seventh

Circuit in American Honda, that the question at the 

class cert hearing is not solely one of whether the 

evidence would be admissible, but also one of -- of 

whether the district judge himself is persuaded that 

this is class-wide proof that has not been impeached in 

his own mind. 

And so -- you know, the mere fact that we 

all understood that what should have been ruled on at 

the class cert hearing encompassed more than pure 

Daubert admissibility, is actually part of our complaint 

here. 

I mean, I think, if you read what the 

district court did, he basically looked at his job as 

looking at whether the model was capable, as in 

literally capable, of -- of -- of establishing -- you 

know, the facts that the plaintiffs say it establishes, 

without really weighing in his own mind whether it had 

been shown to be fit and -- you know, reliable. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Estrada, it seems like a 

remarkable proposition, honestly, especially with a 

client like yours that is well-lawyered. It seems like 

a remarkable proposition that somebody -- a party can 

say, we have objections about the weight of this 

evidence.

strong expert report, and that -- and that we -- and 

that the Court should then infer that there is an 

objection to admissibility of evidence, as opposed, 

again, to the weight and strength of evidence. 

I mean, surely, a district court confronted 

with an argument about the weight and strength of 

evidence does not have to say, oh, I better go hold a 

Daubert hearing to rule on admissibility even though 

nobody's asked me --

MR. ESTRADA: But, Justice Kagan --

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- to rule on admissibility. 

MR. ESTRADA: But, Justice Kagan, I mean, I 

think we could go through chapter and verse to 

everything that we put in the reply brief. But I think, 

in fairness, I have to point out to you that we never 

said that our objection was to the weight and not to the 

admissibility. 

We agree that these people have properly 

scholarly credentials. And after that, as we say in the 

reply brief with citations to the record, we said, this 

model is so unreliable that it is just not usable, 

period, full stop. We went to the Third Circuit and 

said, this is not evidence of any kind, much less --

actually be sort of silly to engage in a motion to 

strike the evidence that we are asking the district 

judge to consider, in order to decide whether it 

actually is reliable. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Estrada, could you 

pronounce for me or give me the legal rule as you want 

us to articulate it? Let me get you out of Daubert, 

okay? Because I think you really can't deny that you 

never raised the word "Daubert" below until the very 

end. Your fight before the district court was on the 

probity of the model, not on a Daubert issue, correct? 

MR. ESTRADA: I don't think that's fair 

because I think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did you use the word 

"Daubert" before the district court? 

MR. ESTRADA: We cited Daubert cases in the 

court of appeals. We did say to the district court that 

the model was not usable. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. So you didn't use 

"Daubert" below --

MR. ESTRADA: I think that's fair.

Tell me how and what rule we announce, so 

that district courts find an expert's evidence 

probative, the other side argues it's not, and when does 

the district court let the jury decide between the two? 

MR. ESTRADA: There --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where is the line that 

the district court draws between class certification and 

merits adjudication, so that, at some point, it goes to 

the jury? 

MR. ESTRADA: There are two things that the 

district court has to do, and both involve an assessment 

of the validity or, as you would put it, probity of the 

expert evidence -- you know, the first one keeps in mind 

that the focus of the class certification hearing is to 

decide whether the -- this case should be tried as a 

class. 

And therefore, the first question that the 

district court has to ask is, even if I think that this 

is not ready now, do they have a methodology that 

sufficiently fits the facts and is reliably based on a 

scientific method, so that these people will be capable 

of proving class-wide this issue at trial. That's not 

enough.

I suppose, or else, we wouldn't have reformulated the

question this way, right? 

MR. ESTRADA: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the way you put the 

question initially, and we reformulated it to be a 

Daubert question. 

MR. ESTRADA: I was -- I was going to point 

out, by reference to one of your opinions, 

Justice Scalia, that there is a question sort of based 

on the Williams case, 504 U.S., as to -- you know, the 

extent to which these issues are open to the Respondent 

to challenge as well. 

Because by the time we framed the cert 

petition -- even though we framed it in terms of 

Daubert, it was abundantly clear, as we pointed out in 

the reply brief, that we were challenging the fit and 

the reliability of the methodology. And there was nary 

a word in the -- in the brief in opposition that 

actually took issue with that. 

On the faith of that, you reformulated the 

question. Your ruling in Williams would say that that 

issue is now over and that we move to the consideration 

of the merits. 

And I would like to reserve the remainder of 

my time for rebuttal. 

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Barnett. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY BARNETT 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. BARNETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan, you are 

exactly right. The petition for certiorari was framed 

not, as counsel just misspoke, in terms of Daubert, but 

it was framed in terms of whether you have to go into --

whether the district court and the court of appeals have 

to deal with merits issues, and that question was what 

was reformulated. 

And to get a sense of how profoundly 

uninterested Comcast was in Daubert and in arguing 

weight and probativeness, as opposed to admissibility, 

which is the question before this Court, they never, 

ever cited Daubert. They didn't cite it in the district 

court. They didn't cite it in the court of appeals. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: One of my -- one of my 

questions in the case is this: There was a question to 

Mr. Estrada with reference to a jury trial. But 

there's -- there's -- the judge doesn't really have a 

gate -- what do you call it -- a gatekeeper function 

here. There is no -- there's no jury.

And if the judge admits the evidence and if 

it turns out that that doesn't meet the standard of 

reliability, then he can exclude it. I don't -- I don't 

see why the judge has to say, all right, now, first, I'm 

going to do Daubert, and next, I'm going to do whether 

this is reliable. 

This is just a magic words approach, it 

seems to me. 

MR. BARNETT: I don't think it is a magic 

word approach at all, Your Honor, because it has 

tremendous significance to people who are actually 

litigating the case. It's -- I submit that it is 

disrespectful to a district judge not to object on 

Daubert grounds and then complain that what he did was 

completely unusable in the court. 

They cited Daubert and Rule 702, 50 -- I 

quit counting at 50, but it was only after the -- the 

question was reframed not to deal with merits questions, 

but to deal with Daubert specifically. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I take it there 

is no argument over whether or not the expert is 

qualified. 

MR. BARNETT: Indeed, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The question is just 

whether his -- his theory makes any sense.

MR. BARNETT: That's true. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the -- and the 

Petitioner says it doesn't. 

MR. BARNETT: But, Justice Kennedy, it's 

also the case that the judge saying, do you have any 

objections to this witness as an expert, that's about as 

big an invitation you can get that, if you have got a 

Daubert objection, you better make it now -- you need to 

make it now. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Mr. Barnett, I -- I 

can think of -- my initial reaction -- it has been an 

awful long time since I have been in the courtroom --

is -- is that that's whether or not this man is -- is 

qualified to give an opinion. 

MR. BARNETT: That was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Step one. The next 

thing is does this opinion make any sense? 

MR. BARNETT: The second step is using 

the -- the Court's opinions in Daubert, as well as in 

Carmichael, as well as in Joiner, which the Court has 

held applies to all kinds of expert testimony in Federal 

court. The district judge has an obligation to serve as 

a gatekeeper, whether there is a jury in the box or not. 

On a preliminary injunction, the court, if 

there is a proper Daubert objection, must make the

objection at that time. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. Do you 

think -- that -- that's why I am trying to get away from 

the magic words. Why do you disagree with the simple 

proposition that a district court, by whatever magic 

words it uses, has to come to the conclusion that the 

expert's testimony is persuasive? And isn't that, at 

bottom line, a judgment that it's reliable and 

probative? 

MR. BARNETT: I completely agree, Justice 

Sotomayor. And we -- we embrace whatever Daubert 

standard anybody wants to apply retroactively. But the 

main point is Judge Padova --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are not 

disagreeing with your adversary on a legal standard. 

Every judge on a -- this is the simple way I formulate 

the rule -- every judge before he certifies -- he or she 

certifies a class, has to decide whether the methods 

being used are probative and relevant, sufficient to 

prove common -- common questions of damages. 

MR. BARNETT: Justice Sotomayor, I agree 

with that proposition if there is a proper objection 

made, such that the district court is put on notice that 

he or she needs to do the work.

hearing to ask specific questions about, what about, 

well, there is one of the four mechanisms that the 

anticompetitive conduct translated into sky high prices 

throughout the Philadelphia DMA. 

JUSTICE ALITO: In this case, why doesn't 

the question of probative value subsume the Daubert 

question? 

MR. BARNETT: I don't think it does, Your 

Honor. And, again, it's not magic words. Trial 

lawyers -- and I have been on this case for almost 10 

years now -- once you say Daubert or once you say 702 or 

once you say, I object, it's not reliable, at the time, 

contemporaneously, the district judge has an opportunity 

to fix whatever the problem is. And the other side has 

a chance to fix whatever the problem is, too. 

JUSTICE ALITO: But if the problem is -- let 

me ask my question in a different way. If the problem 

is that the model that is being -- that was used by the 

expert does not fit the theory of liability that remains 

in the case, would that -- what is the difference in 

determining probative value there and determining 

whether it comes in under Daubert? I don't understand 

it.

not an admissibility question. So, I mean, that's what 

the question is before the Court. That is definitely 

not an admissibility question. It's a question of 

probativeness. And you can analyze it however you want 

to under a clearly erroneous test, which is what applies 

both under a Daubert standard, as well as a class 

certification, where the judge is --

this Court has said it's okay not to object. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We are -- we are 

having an elaborate discussion, and you did in -- in the 

briefs, about whether or not this was a claim that was 

waived below. No court has addressed that yet. We're a 

court of review, not first view. 

So it seems to me that one option for the 

Court, since we did reformulate the question, is to 

answer the question and then send it back for the court 

to determine whether or not the parties adequately 

preserved that option or not -- that objection or not. 

MR. BARNETT: Your Honor, I agree that 

that's one of the options that Your Honor has. But of 

course, it goes back with all the scuffs and scars and 

mess-ups that preceded it up until today. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, fine. I mean, 

and the district court, presumably, can decide based on 

the proceedings and all that below, all the scars and 

mess-ups, whether or not it was adequately preserved or 

not.

monopolize the widget business. That business has 

monopolized because they achieved the power to raise 

price above the competitive level through exclusionary 

practices. For example, United Fruit used to pour 

garbage on the ships of its competitors. 

Now, we have here a class of people who have 

been injured by their monopoly power -- and here they 

are, and you give a list. The judge says to the other 

side, how do you know that's the right list? Well, we 

know; here's how we know. We have an expert here who 

has used a model to pick out the right people who were 

injured by the monopoly power -- its exercise. And the 

other side says, no, that model is no good. 

Well, if it genuinely is no good and really 

worthless, then I guess you haven't shown these are the 

right people for the class. And I think that's what 

they're saying. And so the response to that is, to 

answer this question, do we have to go look at the 

model? I mean, on its face, it seems okay. I don't 

know. I haven't looked at the record. And --

power? And you have to have some way of picking them 

out, and you have chosen this model as a way. So I

worthless.

of the basic misconceptions that this case comes into

Dr. McClave was talking about a causal connection

He was estimating, whatever the -- whatever 

the anticompetitive conduct is, whatever the judge or

for the sky-high prices throughout the Philadelphia 

area -- whatever it is, this is an accurate reflection 

of the damages on a class-wide basis aggregated across

the one who said this is the anticompetitive conduct,

It was Dr. McClave's job to figure out, well, what's the 

harm to the class as a result of that chain of events? 

You are right, Your Honor, that --

Justice Scalia, that Judge -- Judge Padova excluded 

three of the four mechanisms that Dr. Williams talked 

about as having a causal connection. And it turns out 

Dr. Williams --

was based only on the one that the court accepted?

about what the anticompetitive conduct was. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't be agnostic about 

what the anticompetitive conduct is, if you are going to 

do -- if you're going to do an analysis of what are the 

consequences of the -- of the anticompetitive conduct, 

you have to know the anticompetitive conduct you are 

talking about.

no question that the conduct that caused the harm is the 

clustering behavior that Comcast engaged in over a 

decade's time. 

What is not clear -- was not clear, but is 

now, because Judge Padova has told us, which of the 

mechanisms that Dr. Williams formulated as possible 

causes of the -- the possible engines that resulted in 

the prices going way up. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And I guess, in a 

monopolization case, it is not the case that you have to 

trace the damages to the exclusionary conduct. 

MR. BARNETT: Exactly. 

JUSTICE BREYER: In a classical class 

of -- Section 2 case, the damages are caused by the 

monopolization, which lacks skill, foresight, and 

industry justification. So the fact that he omitted 

three, but kept one has nothing to do with damages in 

a classical Section 2 case, is that right? 

MR. BARNETT: Exactly right, Justice Breyer. 

And maybe, if you think of it as the possibility of -- I 

think of in terms of engines. There is an engine that 

is causing something. Maybe it's --

JUSTICE BREYER: But here is the difficulty 

that I am having, a little technical, but -- but it --

this is a regulated industry.

JUSTICE BREYER: And because it's a

doing one of the worst jobs in history. They are 

willing to come in and overbuild and everything, so he 

must be letting prices -- all right. Suppose the judge 

or lawyer were to find, that's okay, it doesn't matter, 

all we're interested in is what Justice Scalia says. 

Then, if that were true, from looking at the 

footnote on this, I guess you'd take this model, and you 

would simply subtract or add to the base, which is 

supposed to be the competitively priced districts. 

MR. BARNETT: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: The districts that also 

have satellite. 

MR. BARNETT: Indeed. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And that shouldn't be tough 

to do, but I don't know if it's tough to do, and I don't 

see how we're ever going to find out.

done. In fact --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know. How would 

you answer such a question?

It's in -- actually in the court of appeals 

record AO 01533 through 34, it is stated there that you 

can take off of the DBS -- if you don't like the DBS 

penetration screen, then you can turn it off, and 

damages are still, as we have established since -- when 

Comcast -- when they finally did file a Daubert motion, 

would be something like $550 million on a class-wide 

basis. 

So that is in the record, as well as there 

is ample evidence, Exhibit 82, which shows 23 different 

iterations of the damages models, including damages 

models that Dr. Chipty on the Comcast side put together, 

slicing and dicing all of this data to show that, no 

matter how you slice it and dice it, almost, if you did 

it in any kind of a fair way that the Federal Judicial 

Center recognizes as a reliable type of methodology, you 

are going to have significant damages across the class 

for each class member throughout the time period. 

The other thing I would like --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Barnett -- I'm sorry. 

Go ahead. 

MR. BARNETT: No, Your Honor. I was about 

to change that subject. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. Then I will.

JUSTICE KAGAN: I am still in search of a 

legal question that anybody disagrees about here. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE KAGAN: You know, I read before the 

district court statement of the standard, now all points 

of the circuit court statement of the standard, where 

the circuit court says, "The inquiry for a district 

court at the class certification stage is whether the 

plaintiffs have demonstrated" -- burden is on you -- "by 

a preponderance of the evidence that they will be able 

to measure damages on a class-wide basis using common 

proof." 

The parties both agree with that statement 

of the standard. It seems to me that the parties also 

both agree -- and this goes back to Justice Sotomayor's 

question -- that if the Daubert question had not been 

waived, that if -- if Comcast had objected to the 

admissibility of this expert report, that, indeed, the 

court would -- should have held a hearing on the 

admissibility of the expert report. 

So this is a case where it seems to me that, 

except for the question of how good the expert report 

is, none of the parties have any adversarial difference 

as to the appropriate legal standard. And -- you know, 

usually, we decide cases based on disagreements about

law. And here, I can't find one. 

Is there any? Do you disagree with 

Mr. Estrada on any statement of the legal standard? 

MR. BARNETT: I -- I do not, Your Honor, and 

I think Justice -- Judge Padova got it exactly right. 

You read the -- the standard that he applied. In fact, 

if anything, it's a tougher standard than should be the 

test. But we're -- we embrace that test and we are 

happy about it, and we don't disagree with Mr. Estrada. 

And this is what I was about to change 

subject to a little bit, the two misconceptions that 

fundamentally affect Comcast's view of the world --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, before you do that, 

let me ask a question related to what Justice Kagan just 

asked. If we were to answer the question presented as 

reformulated, I take it your answer would be that a 

district court under those circumstances may not certify 

a class action; is that right? 

MR. BARNETT: If there is a proper 

objection, properly and timely presented, it's preserved 

up through the appellate courts and all the things that 

you need to do in order to be fair to the judge, as well 

as make sure you get it -- give it as good a chance to 

be right as possible, the answer would be yes. But

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, then the only 

remaining question is whether the issue was in the case 

as a factual -- as a matter of the record here; isn't 

that right? 

MR. BARNETT: Well, if the issue of 

admissibility is in the case, I don't think it is. If 

evidence comes in -- again, this is -- this was not a 

bunch of expert reports that were just piled up on 

the -- in chambers, and Judge Padova went through them. 

He actually, at their request, had a four-day hearing, 

and then a fifth day, where he posed a series -- I think 

it was a four-page letter where the judge says, I'm 

concerned about this, I'm concerned about that, y'all 

come back and tell me why it's okay. 

And what --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could this report be 

probative if it did not satisfy Daubert? 

MR. BARNETT: The answer, Your Honor -- and 

my source is Section 274 of Trial and Corpus Juris 

Secundum, well-recognized in this Court, no doubt. It 

says that, if it's in the record, if it comes in 

unobjected to, it has whatever probative value the 

court -- the trier-of-fact chooses to place on it. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That the court as the 

trier-of-fact chooses to -- that the -- not reserved to

cases where there's a jury? Is that --

MR. BARNETT: No, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that, as I 

indicated before, that the whole question of weight and 

admissibility is somewhat less important when the trial 

judge is not the gatekeeper. The trial judge, at the 

end of the day, can hear the testimony and say, you 

know, I admitted this testimony, but it doesn't make any 

sense, it doesn't work. 

MR. BARNETT: What's happening, Your Honor, 

is you have got to satisfy -- Rule 23(b)(3) says the 

judge has to make findings. That's one of the few 

parts of Rule 23 that talks about findings. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he does what I said, 

but then he has 100 pages of findings. 

MR. BARNETT: Yes, Your Honor. But he's --

he's acting as a gatekeeper, and what he's doing -- or 

she's doing is projecting, what's this trial going to 

look like, based on the evidence in front of me? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, I think that's where 

we disagree. The judge has to make a determination 

that, in his view, the -- the class can be certified. 

MR. BARNETT: Absolutely. He does. And

factual inquiries as -- as to the damages alleged and 

the cause of the injury and whether or not there is a 

common -- whether or not there's a commonality. 

MR. BARNETT: The -- Justice Kennedy, the 

district judge asks, prove to me -- to the plaintiff, 

that you can prove it at trial, prove to me now that, at 

trial, you will be able to submit a damages model that 

passes muster, under Daubert or whatever test there is, 

depending on what the objections are. 

So the judge is acting in a gatekeeper role, 

right then, kind of projecting into the future about 

what am I going to do when the jury's in the box --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's not -- I'll 

think about it, but that's not my understanding. I 

thought the judge has to make a determination that, in 

the next case we are going to hear this morning, that 

the representation is material or it affects the market. 

The judge has to make that conclusion, make that 

finding. 

MR. BARNETT: And the finding that the judge 

makes, based on preponderance of the evidence, 

plaintiffs have shown to me that, more likely than not, 

at trial, plaintiffs will be able to show, on a 

class-wide basis, some evidence, enough to get a verdict 

that could be upheld, enough that satisfies to some

evidence or whatever the test is at trial, that shows 

damages on a class-wide basis. 

So the judge isn't saying, this is it, you 

can't fix it, you can't change it, you can't modify it, 

you can't enhance it between now and trial. He says 

that you can do it. You have shown to me -- to my 

satisfaction, that, more likely than not, that the 

evidence that you will present to the jury at trial is 

going to be admissible, and it's going to be 

sufficiently persuasive if the jury chooses to accept 

it. 

And this is where -- I really want to get to 

this about the merits. This -- I think there is a great 

deal of confusion about what Judge Aldisert meant in the 

Third Circuit when he talked about the merits. 

Comcast, each time construes, when he uses 

the word "merits," talk about incantation of magic 

words, that that means whether it's good or bad, that 

that is what Judge Aldisert was talking about. That is 

not what he was talking about at all. He was talking 

about trial on the merits. He was saying that, right 

now, we don't have to decide whether this model is 

perfect. It's enough. 

The test -- this issue isn't before us 

because it's been waived, Daubert and all that, but if

were presented in a proper case, then observation is it 

doesn't have to be perfect, and it can be enhanced 

between now -- which is supposed to happen at an early, 

practicable time -- and trial, so that the jury can see 

it.

court found when it accepted your expert's theory as

MR. BARNETT: What Judge --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do you think that

MR. BARNETT: What Judge Padova found was 

that the McClave damages model is persuasive to him --

sufficiently persuasive to him, that it could be used at 

trial to prove damages on a class-wide basis. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so what does 

"sufficiently persuasive" mean? 

MR. BARNETT: That more likely than not --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It sounds nice, but more 

likely than not --

MR. BARNETT: More likely than not that it 

will be admissible at trial, and it will meet the

it's I'm convinced that you're right. And that's what 

Judge Aldisert was talking about. 

He said, it's not time for us to say Comcast 

wins or plaintiffs win, based on all this evidence. The 

only thing that's really before the court is whether, 

more likely than not, the plaintiffs have presented a 

model -- we're talking about a model in this case. It 

could be a different issue in a different case. In the 

the Amgen case that's coming up, it could be a different 

issue. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Barnett, this is on a 

different issue, but you had originally suggested that 

you had -- that the motion -- that the settlement that's 

looming was a reason that this Court ought not to decide 

this case. But do you now agree that, given the 

district court's denial of your motion to enforce the 

settlement, that the proposed settlement has no bearing 

on this Court's consideration of the case? 

MR. BARNETT: At this time, Your Honor, I 

think -- I think it has no bearing on what this Court 

does or does not do in this case. It is something that 

we would have the right to appeal at an appropriate 

time, but we're not doing that now.

something that can be used at trial, one way to capture 

that is whether or not this evidence is usable, right? 

MR. BARNETT: I would not say that. And

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: More likely than not 

whether it can be used at trial, that sounds like, is it 

usable? 

MR. BARNETT: Well, the reason I'm 

hesitating is because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know the 

reason you're hesitating.

MR. BARNETT: Well -- and also, it's because 

it's something you don't know. When that word was used, 

"unusable," in court, they were talking about common 

impact. That's what that was about. That was what that 

discussion was about. It wasn't about this model. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, there 

matters for the trier of fact to determine at the merits 

stage, but under -- under Daubert and under Rule 702, 

the judge has to say that the evidence is relevant to 

the task at hand, and it has a reliable foundation.

in academia. Then he hears all the testimony, and he 

says, It just doesn't work here. 

MR. BARNETT: And Judge Padova could have 

done that, but he didn't do that. I think he was 

persuaded by the evidence that Dr. McClave put on, and 

he rejected -- because we know from his 81-page opinion 

that he rejected an awful lot of what Comcast's experts 

said. 

So he -- he could have made that 

determination. And this is why it's an -- if we're 

talking -- if we're not dealing just with an 

admissibility issue that's been forfeited away, we're 

dealing with abuse of discretion and clearly erroneous. 

And this is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I'm not sure what I 

just described is not Daubert. 

MR. BARNETT: Your Honor, if you're in a 

trial court and somebody says Daubert or somebody says 

Rule 702 or somebody says I object to this expert's 

testimony, that has profound significance. And, again, 

I think it's -- it's almost disrespectful to the 

district court to say, it's okay, although this -- this 

question wasn't on the test that you had when you were 

trying to decide the case, we're going to add the 

question to the test, and by the way, you flunked it.

unreliable or not probative evidence. That's really the 

bottom line question. 

MR. BARNETT: I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does it commit legal 

error when it finds something that's unreliable and 

unpersuasive -- or unprobative? 

MR. BARNETT: Well, Your Honor, I agree. 

And of course, that's not the issue in the case because 

Judge Padova was convinced it was reliable. And there's 

plenty of proof that there was. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I think that's a 

fair reading of what he said --

MR. BARNETT: Right.

edges and all the -- where everything is done properly

Why -- whether it's an expert or a lay witness 

testifying, wouldn't you apply that same standard to 

anybody's testimony? 

MR. BARNETT: Justice Sotomayor, let me --

let me just give you an example. There were a bunch of 

issues that the dissenting judge raised, including the 

overbuilding screen, a particular kind of market screen, 

mathematical averages. If -- in the DBS penetration 

screen, if he had raised any of those, if there had been 

a whisper of a hint of a suggestion, of a thought, of 

those things in the district court, we'd have been 

all over that. And we would have proved that it was 

false, that those -- that those statements are untrue. 

And we know that's accurate because, as I 

just read to you from the -- the court of appeals 

record, the DBS screen can, in fact, be taken off, 

eliminated from the sample, and you still have 

$550 million worth of damages on a class-wide basis. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. --

MR. BARNETT: And the reason we got to that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Estrada, you have five minutes 

remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL ESTRADA 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. ESTRADA: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Let me -- let me start with the proposition 

which I continue to find startling, that a damages model 

can stand up to examination on the theory that it is not 

linked to any theory of anticompetitive conduct. Now, 

the theory seems to be that what the McClave model is 

intended to do is to isolate competitive markets 

elsewhere that are competitive in some sense, come to 

the conclusion that the Philadelphia DMA is somehow less 

competitive, and charge whatever the expert says is the 

difference to Comcast. 

But that has a fundamental failure, as a

has to be certainly linked to illegal conduct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? Is that 

what Learned Hand said? Is -- is that what Alcoa holds? 

Is that United Fruit holds when they bomb their 

competitor's ship and achieve monopolization? That the 

only people who can get damages are the people who run 

the ship and were bombed --

MR. ESTRADA: No, I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- who bought those 

bananas? I didn't know that. But besides, if you're 

right, which I tend to doubt, but I'll look it up, if 

you're right --

MR. ESTRADA: Story Parchment. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, all right. Fine. 

I'll look that up. If you're right and as they pointed 

out, it's still one of the easiest things in the world 

to simply change the base for this model. Instead of 

the base being those businesses or homeowners who 

received their service at competitive prices, we say --

we modify it by including those who received services 

where DBS was involved, and that'll be a higher price, 

and we subtract that price from the price they paid 

where there was overbuilding threatened. 

Now, that'll be a new number. They say it 

was a new number. And I think anybody running a model

could do that, but I promise you, I don't know. And to 

know whether you're right on that, or they're right, I 

will have to get into the model-building business, where 

I am not an expert. 

MR. ESTRADA: Well, no. I think all you 

have to do is whether the proponent -- is to ask whether 

the proponent of class certification has discharged his 

duty under this Court's cases, to come forward with 

evidence that is persuasive under the point whether the 

case as a whole can be tried as a class. You don't have 

to become an econometrician. You have to know enough to 

assess whether the record that has been proffered is 

probative on the question before the Court. 

Here, it isn't. And one of the reasons it 

isn't is because they came to the hearing in class 

certification in the fall of 2009 after full merits 

discovery. The papers -- we said to them, we have full 

merits discovery, this model does not work. We had 

variants of not usable. Every word -- I can read it 

all, Justice Kagan, if it's worth taking the time. You 

know, the flaws preclude its use, it's not to be 

accepted, it's not usable, it does not result in a valid 

methodology that can be used. 

And so, having said all of that, we said, 

this model is bunk. You have full class merits

discovery. You have plenty of opportunity to come up 

with a better model. Nothing. 

We go to the court of appeals. It is 

affirmed. Then it goes back to the -- to the district 

court for further trial proceedings. The district 

court, having read the court of appeals' opinion, 

invites them to submit the evolutionary model that the 

court of appeals had in mind. Nothing. We are still 

sticking with our story, McClave's the guy. 

And so they have had every conceivable 

opportunity to develop a model. Why haven't they done 

that, Justice Breyer? Oh, maybe because there is a 

problem in the record. You can take all of the maps in 

the record, which are part of the field supplemental 

appendix, and you can see the different areas of 

penetration for DBS -- you know, has different rates of 

penetration all over the class area. 

Same thing for RCN and FiOS. And you can 

look at what -- what the market penetration is in each 

franchise area. Consider that each of them is a 

different licensing authority, that the overbuilding 

would have to go to franchise by franchise and radiate 

out in the fullness of time. And I don't know if there 

is an econometrician that can combine all of that into a 

single class or subclasses.

They haven't identified one. And the key 

point for the resolution of the case in front of you, 

Justice Kagan, is that the question that comes here is 

whether a class that is more expansive than the one that 

you -- that you certified in Wal-Mart can possibly be 

certified where there is no evidence that is tied to the 

record in the case that is reliably probative that a 

class would exist. 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
