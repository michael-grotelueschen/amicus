 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in case 06-593, Long Island Care at Home versus 

Coke.

 Mr. Farr.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. FARR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor 

Standards Act, Congress made one thing very clear, that 

it wanted the Department of Labor to define the 

boundaries and fill in the details of the companionship 

services exemption. And I think that has two important 

implications for this case.

 First of all, when the Department has filled 

in the details, after notice and comment rulemaking, its 

regulations should receive Chevron deference as long as 

they are permissible implementation of the statute.

 Second, and particularly specific to this 

case, if there are ambiguities in the regulations, or as 

we have here, an apparent facial inconsistency, the 

court should accept the Secretary's resolution of that 

ambiguity provided that it is a reasonable one. And

here we submit it's not only a reasonable one, it is by 

far the most sensible one.

 Now I'd actually like to turn, if I may, to 

the second issue first, because I think that's the 

source of a lot of the concern in this case.

 Plainly the two regulations, section 10 --

552.109(a), which is the regulation directly at issue 

before this Court, and 552.3, which is the regulation 

relied on heavily by the Second Circuit to strike down 

the present regulation, have some inconsistency between 

them.

 But it is also plain that the Department 

could not have intended to say at one and the same time 

that the only employers entitled use the exemption were 

homeowners and then say in another section promulgated 

at the same time that also third-party employers are 

entitled to the exemption. So the question is, how does 

one resolve this apparent inconsistency?

 And the Secretary says, well, the only 

regulation that we promulgated that, in fact, deals 

specifically with the issue of third-party employment is 

552.109(a), which is in fact headed Third-Party 

Employment.

 And that section 552.3, while containing 

some language that might be read to address that issue,

in fact deals with several other topics. Specifically 

it deals with the topic of what kinds of jobs are 

involved in domestic service, maids, chauffeurs, 

footmen, et cetera; where those have to be performed, in 

a private home; and in fact, somewhat more than that, in 

the private home of the person receiving the services.

 So it's not enough, for example, for 

somebody to conduct a service like laundry or baby 

sitting in his or her own house, it has to be in the 

house of the person receiving the services.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the words were 

home of the person who employs, not who receives the 

services but who employs.

 MR. FARR: Oh, that's correct, 

Justice Ginsburg. The literal language is not 

specifically what I was saying. What I'm talking about 

is the Secretary's attempt to resolve what is an 

apparent inconsistency between the literal language in 

552.3 and the literal language of section 552.109(a).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: By -- reading out the 

words "of the person who employs" her?

 MR. FARR: Well, essentially reading them to 

say they, they were not intended to address directly the 

subject of third party employment which is the subject 

addressed in 109(a). And I think if one is -- even

leaving aside the question of deference to the Secretary 

for a moment, Justice Ginsburg, if one is simply talking 

about making a fair resolution of these conflicting 

provisions from the ground up, it seems to me the first 

thing that one would do is apply the canon that the 

specific provision controls the general.

 And if one looks at the two provisions, 

section 109(a) is a provision that deals with one thing 

and one thing only: that is third party employment.

 And it says explicitly and straight out that 

persons who are employed by third-party employers are --

or third-party employers who employ persons performing 

domestic services are entitled to the exemption.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought it also 

addressed, unlike the more general regulation, just 

people who have companionship services. So if you have 

a maid or a cook or a footman, who doesn't provide 

companionship, then 109 is inapplicable.

 MR. FARR: That would be true. Now that 

would be inapplicable --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What's a footman? I don't 

even know what a footman is.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is a footman?

 MR. FARR: I think that may be beyond my

expertise, Justice Scalia.

 The -- of course that doesn't address 

anything beyond companionship services, of course, 

because there is not an exemption beyond that. And 

that's one of the interesting things about 552.3. In 

addition to generally dealing with this question of what 

kind of jobs are domestic service, it is, in fact, going 

well beyond anything that is necessary to a discussion 

of the exemption for companionship services, because 

jobs like chauffeurs, and maids, and all of that are not 

subject to the exemption. So it really looking at what 

552.3 is doing despite the couple of words that -- at 

the beginning of it, is giving a general definition of 

what constitutes domestic employment, what constitutes 

domestic services for purposes not only of the exemption 

but, in fact, really for the purposes of coverage as 

well.

 And the Department has taken that position. 

It says this is, in fact, the only definition of 

domestic service that we have in the regulations, and it 

is not just intended to be limited to the particular 

situation of the exemption. It applies more broadly 

than that to coverage as well.

 So I think in all those senses, 

Justice Kennedy, 109 is a very specific provision, 552.3

deals with a number of other subjects.

 Now, one other thing on the statutory 

interpretation part is that the reading of 552.3 that 

Respondent offers also leads to the problem that 

essentially sets up a tension with another one of the 

regulations which is 552.101(a). 552.101(a) which I'm 

sorry -- I don't have the right page number here -- it 

is on page 77a of the appendix to the petition -- has, 

carries over the language from 552.3 about in the home 

of the employer that Justice Ginsburg referred to. But 

then it also says that this includes people who are 

commonly referred to as private household workers.

 And the one thing we know from the 

Department of Labor submissions to Congress in 1974 and 

also from what the Department has said before this Court 

is that that term at the time was defined by the 

Department and known by Congress to constitute more than 

just employees employed by the homeowner. There was a 

special second category for people who worked in the 

home of the homeowner at the homeowner's request but 

were employed by a third party agency.

 Now somewhere underlying all of this 

question, I think, is statutory interpretation and 

indeed all of Respondent's arguments against deference 

to the Department is a basic underlying premise, which

is that Congress really would not have wanted, even if 

it didn't say so, for the exemption to apply to 

employees who work for third parties.

 And I would just like to suggest that there 

really is no basis for thinking that Congress would have 

wanted that.

 First of all, third participate employers 

such as private agencies provide services for the 

particular group of people which Congress was trying to 

assist with this exemption. People who by reason of age 

or disability are unable to care for themselves. 

Agencies acting as the employers specifically can do the 

hiring, they can do the vetting and the screening, the 

background screening for employees. They can provide 

necessary paperwork, filing Social Security documents 

and things like that.

 So, in fact, for Congress to have some sort 

of bias against covered enterprises seems a little bit 

unusual.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Farr, I'm not sure I 

followed your argument with regard to 552,101(a).

 MR. FARR: Uh-huh. Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Page 77a as you said.

 But what is your argument there? I mean, 

that seems to, that seems to reinforce the provision

that you say we should ignore or at least should accept 

the Secretary's reinterpretation of.

 MR. FARR: Well perhaps, perhaps I wasn't as 

clear as I intended to be. It does, as I indicated, 

have the language about the private home of the 

employer.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.

 MR. FARR: However, the -- the preceding 

sentence says the term, referring to the term that is at 

issue in 552.3, domestic service employment, includes 

persons who are frequently referred to as private 

household workers. The fact is that those two 

statements are inconsistent with each other. The term 

cannot be limited to employees of the home owner and 

also include persons who are frequently referred to as 

private household workers, at least if one means all the 

persons referred to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah. I see. Is that 

clear in the -- in the specific Senate report that is 

referred to here?

 MR. FARR: In the specific Senate report, in 

both the '73 and the '74 reports --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This, the one that's cited 

in the regulation itself. Because I -- otherwise, I 

don't, I ignore those things. That's cited in the

regulation. Does that report say it?

 MR. FARR: What? The report uses the term 

private households workers frequently interchangeably 

with the term domestic employees. That is what is clear 

from the report itself.

 Now, the Department of Labor when it was 

reporting to Congress, as Congress has required it to 

do, the Department of Labor used the term private 

households workers, specifically defined in there by the 

Department, to say this means not just employees 

employed by the homeowner but also people who are 

employed by third parties.

 So I think it is a fair assumption that when 

the Senate report was using that phrase, it was using it 

in the same manner that the Department of Labor reports 

have. And, in fact, at one point in the -- moving 

further backward in the legislative history, Senator 

Dominick actually quoted that language, the definition 

from the Department of Labor, on the Senate floor during 

the debates.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the 

Department of Labor's first take on this was that the 

exemption did not apply to third-party employers. That 

was the original Department of Labor position, wasn't 

it?

MR. FARR: No, Justice Ginsburg. I believe 

that's correct. There was a, an opinion letter from the 

Department in November of 1975 -- this is an opinion 

letter that's cited at page 21 of the Solicitor 

General's brief -- which specifically stated that the 

exemption applied whether the employee was an employee 

of the homeowner or of a public or private --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm referring to the 

notice and comment rulemaking in which you place great 

stock. I thought the original notice and comment 

rulemaking said the exemption does not apply to 

third-party employers.

 MR. FARR: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg. I 

misunderstood the time frame we were dealing with. In 

the notice of proposed rulemaking, actually I would 

disagree with that characterization also. The notice of 

proposed rulemaking made a division among third-party 

employers. It said the exemption would not be available 

to those third-party employers who were covered 

enterprises but it would be available to those who were 

not covered enterprises.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. Does the 

notice of proposed rulemaking set forth the agency's 

position?

 MR. FARR: No, it does not.

They're just floating an idea. You know --

MR. FARR: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Run it up the flagpole, see 

if --

MR. FARR: Well, that it solicited comments 

on that proposal. And after the comments, it changed 

its position to say no, in fact, all third-party 

employers will be exempt.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And -- and there was no 

further discussion of it after -- after it sent out the 

notice of proposed ruling that said third party 

employees will not be exempt, and then it said they will 

be exempt, did it give reasons for the change?

 MR. FARR: Yes, if I can just -- if I can 

quibble with the premise of the question. The first 

time it said some third-party employers would be exempt 

and some wouldn't. Then when it changed --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Some would be the ones 

that qualified as -- what is the phrase, enterprises 

engaged in commerce?

 MR. FARR: That's correct -- those would be 

the ones under the proposed rulemaking that would have 

been denied the exemption. When in fact -- when, in 

fact, the Labor Department said no, in fact, the

exemption should apply to all third-party employers, it 

said it found that more consistent with the statutory 

language. And it also said it was more consistent with 

what it had done under other regulations which had been 

passed under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Farr, would you agree 

that the position expressed in the notice itself would 

have -- in the original notice would have been 

consistent with the statutory language?

 MR. FARR: I'm not sure of that, 

Justice Stevens, to be honest with you. I mean one of 

the difficulties here in answering that is that I think, 

because the Department has such broad authority under 

213(a)(15) to define and delimit the term, I think 

what's consistent with the statute has expanded 

somewhat.

 On the other hand, I have to say I don't 

really see where there would be in the language of the 

statute any basis for drawing a distinction between 

different kinds of third-party employers. The 

phraseology in the coverage provisions, the phraseology 

in the exemption provisions, really doesn't allow for 

that in terms of any sort of statutory interpretation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well there would be a 

basis in terms of the size of the third-party employers.

MR. FARR: I mean, it's possible, but as I 

say, the -- I mean, among the difficulties that covered 

enterprises is not just corporations and big and small 

corporations. Covered enterprises beginning in 1974 

includes state and local governments. So what Congress 

would have been addressing here, if it had been squarely 

facing the issue, would have not just been the question 

of how to treat large and small corporations, but 

whether it wanted to deny the exemption to covered 

enterprises such as state and local agencies who, in 

fact, do provide a lot of the direct employees who 

provide companionship care. They have a lot of 

employees who actually go into homes and care for people 

who are employed by state and local governments. And I 

think it would be a little bit unusual for Congress, who 

is reasonably solicitous of state interests, to deny 

them an exemption that would have been of considerable 

importance to them. As the State of -- or the City of 

New York brief points out, this is a very extensive 

endeavor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Were they covered before, 

before there was any provision that dealt with household 

workers? If state and localities were considered 

enterprises engaged in commerce, then presumably they 

were -- they had no exemption before, their companion

care people, just as household workers, would be covered 

by the Fair Labor Standards Act.

 MR. FARR: No, but I think, Justice 

Ginsburg, the important point is they were not covered 

prior to 1974. There were certain --

JUSTICE SOUTER: They were not treated as 

covered enterprises.

 MR. FARR: That's correct. They were --

they were, if they worked in schools or institutions 

like hospitals. Other than that, they were not until 

1974. That's exactly correct. This, in fact, would 

have been denying them an exception at the very time 

that for other occupations aside from companionship 

services, they were first having coverage applied to 

them.

 If there are no further questions, I'd like 

to reserve the remainder of my time.

applies by its terms to any employee employed in 

domestic service employment to provide companionship 

services for the aged or infirm. The Act imposes no 

limitation based on the identity of the employer. And 

the Agency's regulation of 552.109 extending the 

exception to employees of third parties is entitled to 

deference.

 The Department expressly invoked its 

statutory rulemaking authority in adopting Section 109, 

552.109. It utilized ed notice and comment rulemaking 

procedures both in 1975 and each time it considered 

amending the regulation. And States and care providers 

have relied upon it in devising systems to provide 

appropriate services to the aged and the infirm.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the Department 

of Labor had enacted its regulations as originally 

proposed, those regulations would have been invalid?

 MR. SALMONS: No, I don't think so, Your 

Honor. If you're referring to the initial proposed 

rulemaking that would have exempted only some third 

parties, we think that would have been a permissible 

reading of the exemption given the fact that the 

Secretary is provided very broad defined limit 

authority. But we certainly think there's nothing in 

that exemption that precludes the construction that's

been adopted here. In fact, we think it is the most 

consistent with that language.

 The language of 5523 upon which Respondent 

relies does not change that conclusion. While if read 

in isolation that language could require that domestic 

service employees have to provide their services in the 

home of the employer, it should be not -- it should not 

be given that reading for the reasons explained in the 

Department's 2005 advisory memorandum.

 The Department's construction of its own 

regulations contained in that memorandum is itself 

entitled to deference under Our and Seminole Rock and 

its construction harmonizes the various provisions at 

issue here far better than Respondent's reading of 553 

does.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The statute treats 

together babysitters and elder care people, but I take 

it the babysitters if they were working for an agency 

rather than for the householders, there wouldn't be any 

exemption? Is that right?

 MR. SALMONS: That's correct, and that's 

tied to a specific term that only applies to the 

exemption as to babysitters. The only thing that's 

exempt with regard to babysitters is babysitting on a 

casual basis. Congress certainly could have included a

casual basis requirement with regard to the exemption 

for companionship services. We think it's very notable 

that it did not and we read from that that Congress 

wanted all domestic service employees providing 

companionship services to be exempt, and we think that's 

most consistent with the goal of ensuring that those 

individuals who most need this type of care have the 

opportunity to receive them at a reasonable cost.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it odd that this --

the basic thing about the '74 legislation, it was going 

to add to the Fair Labor Standards Act people who were 

not covered before. So it added household workers. And 

yet you say that, while Congress had its mind trained on 

adding people, it also subtracted people who were 

covered before, took them out, removed them from the 

coverage of the Act.

 MR. SALMONS: Well, we think that that is 

the consequence of the companionship services exemption, 

but we don't think that's odd based on the Department of 

Labor's view of what the purpose of that exemption is 

and based on the textual difference between, for 

example, the exemption for baby sitting services and the 

exemption for companionship services.

 The exemption here expresses no limitation 

based on the identity of the employer and we think it

was well within the agency's discretion to conclude that 

what Congress had in mind here was a categorical 

exemption based on the type of services that are being 

provided; and while that may mean that there are certain 

workers who are now exempt who were not previously 

exempt, that's because Congress for the first time in 

1974 focused on this problem of companionship services 

being provided to those who cannot care for themselves; 

and we think that follows from the text, and for the 

reasons Congress adopted that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Salmons, can I ask you 

a question about the importance of the whole litigation. 

Am I correct in believing that there's a provision in 

the law that protects the defendants from damages 

liability if they relied in good faith on the 

regulation, so that what we're really talking about is 

whether the regulation would apply in the future rather 

than there being a damage issue in the case?

 MR. SALMONS: Well, there is a safe harbor 

provision that allows for reliance by employers on a 

statement by the agency.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That would clearly apply 

to this case, would it not?

 MR. FARR: We certainly think it would. I 

take it Respondents in this case would disagree and

would point to the language of 552.3. I'm not sure, for 

example, how the Second Circuit would have resolved that 

question, given the way it viewed the statute here. But 

we do think that that would apply and so I think one 

view of that would be it's largely prospective.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So in your view we're 

really faced with a question of whether the regulation 

should be given prospective effect.

 MR. SALMONS: I'm sorry? What would be 

given prospective effect?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: As to whether the 

Government's position should be given prospective effect 

because the past liability doesn't -- the damage 

liability just doesn't exist.

 MR. SALMONS: Well, that is our view. 

Again, I think that would be an issue that would be 

litigated and I'm sure litigated heavily in the hundreds 

of cases that are being filed under this provision. And 

I think it's -- one of the concerns I think of the 

agency here was to provide a clear statement with regard 

to how these seemingly conflicting provisions of the 

regulation are to be reconciled and applied.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not seemingly 

conflicted. They conflict.

issue with that. I think that there are a variety of 

things that point to the conclusion that the language in 

552.3 that refers to "in the home of the employer" 

simply cannot be read literally. It was borrowed from 

the Social Security context and if read the way 

Respondents do we think would raise a serious question 

about the scope of coverage because the agency has 

always viewed 552.3, notwithstanding the initial line 

that says "For purposes of the exemption," to provide 

the relevant definition for coverage as well. And no 

party, or amici for that matter, before this Court nor 

the Department thinks that there's a difference between 

the identity of the employer for purposes of coverage. 

And we also think, given the language in 101 that refers 

to private household workers, the definition of which 

was provided to Congress in a report by the Department 

of Labor and is relied upon in the advisory memorandum 

in 2005, which clearly applies to third party employers, 

suggests that 553 cannot be read literally.

 And of course we know that at the same time 

that the agency adopted 552.3 it felt the need to adopt 

a specific regulation dealing with the question of 

third-party employment which would not be relevant --

which would not be necessary under Respondent's reading.

 If the Court has no further questions --

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD C. BECKER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. BECKER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 On October 1, 1974, just five months after 

the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act took 

effect, the Department of Labor exercised its delegated 

law-making function to define this term "domestic 

service employment," which exists in the companionship 

exemption and nowhere else in the amendments. And they 

defined its clearly and explicitly to apply only to 

companions and baby sitters employed by the household.

 At the same time, DOL provided a persuasive 

explanation for that definition. The Department found 

that such companions and baby sitters when employed by 

covered enterprises had been covered prior to the 

amendments and that it could not have been Congress' 

purpose, when amendments were explicitly designed to 

extend coverage, to at the same time contract coverage. 

The very preamble to the Act states that the purposes of 

the amendments are to expand the coverage of the Act. 

Therefore, the DOL itself concluded in October of 1974

that it was not the purpose of those amendments to deny 

the Act's protection to previously covered domestic 

service employees.

 The definition in 552.3, which expressly 

applies only to the exemption, conflicts directly with 

the final third-party regulation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Was that later?

 MR. BECKER: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: How much later?

 MR. BECKER: The final regulations were 

promulgated in February of 2005.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I thought that the 

provision that was -- what is the number -- - where they 

say 552.109; that didn't appear anywhere until many 

years later.

 MR. BECKER: No, no, Your Honor. That was 

in the final regulations, which were promulgated in 

February -- excuse me -- in 1975, not 2005.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, you read --

MR. BECKER: In the final regulations.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You read 3 and 3 says what 

you said it says. All right. How much later did they 

promulgate 109?

 MR. BECKER: That was in the final 

regulations in February of 75.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The same time that 

552.3 was finally promulgated.

 MR. BECKER: That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They came out 

together, right?

 MR. BECKER: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I thought. So 

the same day they say, 3, you have to have these 

domestic workers employed by the old lady who's sick, 

and then in 109 they say you don't.

 MR. BECKER: That's correct. There's a 

direct conflict.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, why is 

that a conflict? Let's imagine -- it sounds like a 

conflict. But it's easy for me to imagine a regulation 

that says birds for purposes of this are animals that 

fly, and then 15 pages later it says, but by the way, 

penguins don't and they're still covered. I mean, why 

is that a conflict? There are lots of specific 

situations. If I read that, I would have thought, well, 

okay, they have an exception.

 MR. BECKER: Your Honor, the definitional 

regulation, 552.3, explicitly defines a term used only 

in the companionship services exemption, "domestic 

service employment." And it defines it clearly and

explicitly to apply only to employment by the household.

 Therefore, there is a direct conflict with 

the so-called third party employer regulation, which 

appears to say that the exemption can apply to employees 

employed by third parties.

 The importance of the conflict is twofold. 

One, when the original regulation was proposed the 

Department provided a persuasive explanation. Congress 

surely didn't intend to contract coverage in amendments 

designed explicitly to expand coverage.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Did Congress intend to 

cover, which I guess is a growing situation, that there 

is an old woman or man and they're very sick and they 

live in their house, there's only one way to keep them 

from having to go to an institution. Their children 

hire a companion to look after them. Now, that's a 

third party.

 MR. BECKER: Your Honor, that question has 

been posed by some of the amici and it is a good 

question, but not the question before you.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Because?

 MR. BECKER: And I submit that if the 

Department construed section 552.3 to say when our words 

say "employed by the household" that could include a 

broader notion of the household, for example a son or

daughter living outside the household, that might be a 

permissible construction of the Department's own 

regulation. But the construction which simply takes 

those words --

JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say that. It 

says "about, in or about a private home of the person by 

whom he is employed." I live in San Francisco. My 

mother lives in Massachusetts. Now, if I hire a 

companion to live in Massachusetts, that companion does 

not work about a private home of the person, me, by whom 

she is employed. So if we're being literal and if you 

win this case, I don't see how -- and I'm worried about 

this, obviously -- however -- and I think it's probably 

very common, that all over the country it's the family, 

the children, the grandchildren, an aunt, an uncle, 

maybe a good friend, maybe they're not even related, who 

is paying for a companion for an old, sick person so 

they don't have to be brought to an institution.

 And if you win this case, it seems to me 

suddenly there will be millions of people who will be 

unable to do it and, hence, millions of sick people who 

will move to institutions. Now, if I were to say that 

that isn't totally a legal point, it is of course a 

legal point because it's a question of what people 

intended, but a worrisome point, I would be telling the

truth. It is a very worrisome point.

 MR. BECKER: It's a very important question 

of public policy and therefore let me answer in two 

ways. One, I think there is a proper procedure even 

under the existing regulations to address that concern. 

The elderly individual that you're concerned about who 

is severely disabled and thus needs this care, the child 

or family member who is employing the companion to care 

for them could do so as their guardian, and therefore as 

a technical legal matter would be doing so, the 

employment would be by the person who resides in the 

home.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't take a whole lot 

of imagination for Justice Breyer to give the money to 

his mother, who could then hire.

 MR. BECKER: Exactly.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, a clever lawyer 

would think of that, I think.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. BECKER: A clever lawyer could do this.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And perhaps there are 

people, lawyers in the Government, who try to see 

through that kind of thing.

 MR. BECKER: But let me answer the second --

JUSTICE BREYER: And there are many -- maybe

Justice Scalia has the answer.

 MR. BECKER: Let me answer a second way to 

what is a serious concern. And the second way the 

situation could be dealt with is by the Department of 

Labor. They could look at their regulations and say, 

the industry has changed and therefore, in a way which 

could certainly be consistent with Congress's intent 

because it would not be withdrawing coverage from a 

previously covered employee who was employed by an 

enterprise, we could say that the exemption applies to 

companions and baby sitters employed by private 

individuals, including the homeowner, the son or 

daughter, etcetera.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You're saying it's 

permissible to change the rules because the industry has 

changed. Is it not possible that the industry changed 

at about the time the statute was enacted? That the 

prevalence of third-party employers is something that 

really developed later?

 MR. BECKER: As an empirical matter, that is 

clearly the case, Justice Stevens. However, we know 

several things about Congress in 1974. We know that the 

enterprise coverage was relatively new. They adopted it 

in 1961, expanded it in 1966, and indeed expanded these 

very amendments in 1974. So Congress was aware of the

prior coverage. We know that the Department of Labor, 

in the very reports which have been cited by the 

petitioner, stated both in January of 1973 and in 

January of 1974 in their reports to Congress on the Act, 

stated that there was prior coverage of domestics 

employed by third parties. We know there was 

enforcement activity by the Department of Labor against 

such third-party employers.

 So while the industry has certainly changed, 

there were enterprises who employed domestics, including 

companions, in 1974, and Congress was aware of it and 

stated over and over again in the preamble, in the 

committee reports, which indeed, the House committee 

report said, "Our intention is to expand the act to the 

extent of Federal power."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- putting aside 

-- putting 552.109 aside, how is 552.3 a plausible 

interpretation of the statute?

 MR. BECKER: Your Honor, we think it is the 

most plausible interpretation for the following reasons:

 Number one, contrary to what has been 

suggested, the language in the exemption is not 

identical to the language in the extension provision 

extending the minimum wage and overtime requirements. 

There is an important difference, and that difference is

the word employment. Now that's important for several 

reasons. Number one, of course, coverage provisions are 

to be read broadly and exemptions narrowly. So there's 

an additional word that can and would suggest it should 

be read as a term of limitation.

 Number two, that difference must be given 

significance, if possible. The word should not be read 

to mean the same as the coverage provisions when it 

doesn't exist in the coverage provisions.

 And number three, we should avoid 

redundancy. There is a reading of that unique language, 

"domestic service employment", which makes sense and in 

fact, is exactly the reading given by the Department.

 Congress did not intend to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What employment 

would someone who's hired by a third party be engaged in 

if not domestic service employment?

 MR. BECKER: The word domestic service 

employment is not necessary to describe what you 

described, Mr. Chief Justice. If that is what the 

Congress intended to describe, it could have said simply 

an employee employed to provide companionship services.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it could have said a 

lot of things. But I find it -- you're hanging your 

case upon the proposition that there is a difference

between domestic service employment and employed in 

domestic service employment.

 Wow. You know, I just don't see how there's 

any difference in those two at all.

 MR. BECKER: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying we have to 

find some difference no matter how imaginative the 

difference might be. If there were a difference, I'm 

not sure it's the difference that you're arguing for.

 MR. BECKER: What I'm suggesting is not that 

our case relies or hangs on that word. What I'm 

suggesting is if that word, that phrase, "domestic 

service employment", is given the definition which the 

Department of Labor itself gave it, it avoids reading 

two phrases which are different to mean the same thing. 

It avoids redundancy. And moreover, it is wholly 

consistent with every other piece of evidence we have 

about Congress's intent.

 Even the Department of Labor suggested it 

surely could not have been Congress's intent to retract 

coverage. The definition is consistent with that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you what your 

proposal is with regard to the contradictory 

regulations, 552.3 and 552. -- what is it, 109?

 I think they are contradictory.

Now, the Agency has come up with a solution. 

We will interpret the former quite unrealistically to 

mean something that it doesn't seem to us to say but --

you know -- close enough for government work.

 What is your solution for solving the 

inconsistency? Are both of the regulations bad?

 MR. BECKER: My solution, Your Honor, has 

two parts but leads to the same conclusion. Our 

solution is that in applying the Act, which is the 

question here, does the Act apply to Ms. Coke's 

employment, this Court should apply the definitional 

regulations for two reasons, the definitional regulation 

for two reasons. One, it is the regulation, which no 

one disputes, and was promulgated in the exercise of the 

Department's law making function. The Department 

expressly defined and delimited its term "domestic 

service employment" in 552.3 and expressly said it was 

not doing so in the third-party regulation. So it's 

entitled to greater deference for that reason. But 

moreover --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What's your other reason?

 MR. BECKER: It is the only definition which 

makes sense, which doesn't lead to a whole series of 

problems.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because of employed and

domestic employment versus --

MR. BECKER: For --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- domestic service?

 MR. BECKER: For the following five reasons, 

Your Honor. One, it avoids reading a term in the 

statute, not only a term in the regulation but a term in 

the statute, completely out of the statute. And that is 

the term "employment".

 Secondly, as the Department found, it is 

consistent with what was Congress's clear intent, to 

expand and not to contract coverage.

 Thirdly, if one looks at the debates, and 

there was extensive and vigorous debate about these 

amendments, the exclusive focus in Congress was the 

household. The opponents were exclusively concerned 

with the extension of coverage to the households. So 

applying the exemption to protect only household 

employees is wholly consistent with what was Congress's 

exclusive --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're getting into 

arguments now that are not about the regulation but 

they're about the statute. I'm assuming that we have 

regulations that are entitled to deference. And you 

have two regulations that are conflicting. Now, how do 

you decide which one prevails? Counsel for the other

side says the specific governs the general, certainly an 

ancient prescription.

 Counsel also says that this is an agency 

regulation. The agency is given great deference in the 

interpretation of it own regulations. And even if the 

agency had said well, you know, they do conflict, we 

admit it, they totally conflict, we won't even try to 

reinterpret 552.3, we think that's the one that's wrong, 

why wouldn't we accept their statement to that effect?

 MR. BECKER: Your Honor, of course setting 

aside, as you do, our argument that Congress has 

specific intent on this question, looking only at the 

regulation --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's statutory. I just 

want to focus on the regulation arguments, not the 

statutory --

MR. BECKER: Let me answer in several ways. 

First, this Court has clearly held that an agency does 

not have unbounded discretion to construe its own 

regulations. When the terms of the regulations are 

unambiguous, they cannot be construed away. Now here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They aren't unambiguous. 

They contradict each other. The agency has to do 

something about it, and here the agency made a choice. 

Even if I assume the choice was, we're going to

disregard 552.3, we're going to strike out those words, 

they were the mistake. One or the other had to be the 

mistake. We decided it was this one. Why shouldn't we 

take their word on it?

 MR. BECKER: Again, for two reasons, Your 

Honor. There's a difference between conflict and 

ambiguity. The words are unambiguous, and it's not 

simply the -- there's two sets of words which they 

attempt to read out of the regulation, one of the 

unambiguous words that require employment by the person 

who's living in the home, and the other is the prefatory 

language which says the regulation only applies to the 

exemption. So in the guise of deference, the Solicitor 

General and the petitioners actually suggest to this 

Court that it should take apart the regulation and 

ignore two of its three operative provisions.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But if they're flatly 

contradictory, doesn't your argument have to be that 

.109(a) has lesser status? That's what it boils down 

to, isn't it?

 MR. BECKER: That is certainly my primary 

argument, that this statute is relatively unique in that 

it vested two very different sorts of authority in the 

Department of Labor, one a clear law making authority to 

actually define and delimit, to specify what the terms

in the law mean --

JUSTICE ALITO: I'm talking about what you 

think the Department of Labor was doing when it 

promulgated 109(a). It was thinking in effect the 

following: We have the power to issue a regulation here 

that has the force and effect of law, and we're going to 

go through the procedure that would be necessary to 

issue such a regulation. But we're not invoking that 

power here because we want this interpretation which we 

think is the correct interpretation of the statute not 

to be followed -- not to get as much deference from the 

courts as it would if we were invoking our power.

 Does that make any sense? That an agency 

would proceed in that way?

 MR. BECKER: Your Honor, it not only makes 

sense, it's been the Department's pattern since the Act 

was adopted. That is, the Department since the Act was 

adopted has split its regulations into those under the 

exemptions -- for example the primary exemption for 

professional, executive and administrative employees --

has split its regulations under those exemptions into 

those which define and delimit, into those which do not 

define and delimit, or other general statements that 

apply to their interpretation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but interpretive

regulations are in other areas wholly valid before the 

courts and entitled to Chevron deference, at least if 

they're adopted by notice and comment rulemaking. You 

know, we have nothing, what should I say, subordinate 

about interpretive regulations. In fact, probably most 

of the significant regulations of the most important 

agencies are interpretive regulations.

 MR. BECKER: The important difference here, 

Justice Scalia, is the statute. The statute, like the 

tax statute which was interpreted by this Court in Vogel 

and Rowan, creates two types of authority. And not only 

under the Fair Labor Standards Act, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that you say 

it creates two types, but there is no indication that it 

intended one type of authority to be entitled to less 

respect from the courts than the other. What do you 

rely on for that?

 MR. BECKER: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is the proposition 

that an interpretive regulation is somehow not a 

full-fledged binding regulation?

 MR. BECKER: Well, let me qualify the 

question, if I might. The Petitioner would suggest that 

we're relying on simply a label, this is in the 

interpretive section and the other is in the general

regulation section. Far from it. We are relying on a 

very clear statement both in the regulations, 552.2(c), 

as well as in both the proposed regulations and the 

final regulations, which clearly state that only those 

in Part A define and delimit. Why is that an important 

distinction? It's an important distinction because 

Congress clearly meant these two grants to be different. 

Otherwise, why would it have granted an express power to 

define and delimit which would otherwise be redundant of 

the general rulemaking authority?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They're different but not 

necessarily of different -- entitled to different 

respect from the courts. A defined -- what is it, 

define and delimit? These are regulations that don't 

even purport to be an interpretation of any language in 

the statute, but the use of authority given to the 

agency to cut out certain areas, to say the -- this rule 

won't apply to companies over this -- that can't 

possibly be an interpretation of the statute.

 So Congress says we're going to give the 

agency that authority. In addition, of course, we're 

going to give this agency the authority that every other 

agency has, which is to interpret -- interpret the 

language of the statute.

 MR. BECKER: Well, Your Honor, I think we

can safely assume in 1974 when Congress created these 

two types of authority, it did so with knowledge of the 

law. And this Court, if you compare its decision in 

Addison to its decision in Skidmore, clearly itself 

distinguished between the exercise of those two 

different interpretive or rulemaking authority. Clearly 

in Addison, construing a very similar term in a 

different exemption, giving the Department of Labor the 

power to define a particular term in the exemption, said 

that is law making authority. And we will follow what 

the Department of Labor says unless it's clearly 

inconsistent with the statutory -- with Congress's 

intent.

 In Skidmore, where that type of expressed 

delegated law making authority to define and delimit was 

not at issue, the Court said we will record only that 

degree of deference to which the regulation --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Skidmore was before a 

rather significant case called Chevron.

 MR. BECKER: Absolutely, Your Honor. But it 

was also before the 1974 amendment. So if the question 

is, what was Congress intending in creating two types of 

rulemaking authority, the power to define and delimit, 

and the general rulemaking authority, I think we need to 

consider Congress's intent at that time.

JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean we're going to 

divide all administrative law now into those -- those 

regulations -- those provisions that were adopted by 

Congress pre-Chevron and those adopted by Congress 

post-Chevron, and for the ones adopted pre-Chevron we're 

going to treat regulation as essentially suggestions by 

the agency which we give Skidmore deference to, and the 

ones after Chevron, we're going to treat differently. 

Do you have any case of ours that suggests something 

like that, which seems to me a very strange manner of 

proceeding?

 MR. BECKER: Let me answer in two ways, Your 

Honor. One, it would not be any case. Here we have a 

particular statutory scheme that is contrary to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ought not to get as 

much deference from the courts.

 MR. BECKER: Here we have a case essentially 

described by Justice Kennedy in & Haga, where we have a 

different statutory scheme combined with a explicit 

statement by the Agency as to which part of that scheme 

the Agency is operating under. But the case I would 

cite, or the cases would be Rolo and Rove which have not

possibly they had -- they promulgated the whole thing 

pursuant to the rulemaking power under that particular 

statute, because that's what it says in 552.2. It says 

"this part" -- it doesn't say subpart, it says part --

and part is 552. And both regs we are talking about are 

in the part. And B says interpretations, but they don't 

mean interpretive rules, because when you look at those 

interpretations, they have a whole lot of numbers in 

them, and divide by 32. Nobody thinks that Congress 

meant in this statute divide by 32, as opposed by divide 

by 33.

 So as I read that, I thought the whole thing 

is promulgated pursuant to their rulemaking authority; 

Part A has more general things. Part B has more 

specific things. Where am I wrong?

 MR. BECKER: Well, I think the question, 

Your Honor, is which of the regulations were promulgated 

pursuant to the specific authority --

JUSTICE BREYER: All of them. All of them 

is what it says unless I missed something.

 MR. BECKER: Well, I think what you missed 

is that a simple citation to the exemption does not 

translate into an exercise of the power to define and 

delimit. Because the Department was very, very specific 

as to when it was exercising that power. In 552.2(c) it

says the definitions required by the legislation are 

provided in the following sections and it enumerates 

them and does not include the third-party regulation.

 Now Petitioners would suggest well, that's 

just a definition. They also have the power to delimit. 

However, both the notice of proposed rulemaking and the 

notice of final rulemaking said that we are exercising 

our power to define and delimit in subpart A.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I got the point.

 MR. BECKER: But part B is different.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why are you sure 

there's a conflict in the first place? You know, 552.3 

says that the term domestic service employment refers to 

services performed in the home of the employer. It 

doesn't say it only refers to that. And then you go 

down and 109 says it also includes employees who are 

employed by a third party.

 I mean, can't they be reconciled in that 

way.

 MR. BECKER: I don't think so, Your Honor. 

And its certainly not the way that the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not the way the 

Agency has done it. But you don't think we should defer 

to them, anyway. So --

(Laughter.)

 MR. BECKER: That's correct. But the 

regulation -- 552.3 defines the statutory term which 

only exists in the exemption, domestic service 

employment.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but it says it 

refers to something. It doesn't say as many of these 

regulations and statutes do, is, you know, it is defined 

as.

 And particularly when you're confronted with 

what would otherwise be a conflict, maybe refers to 

should be read to mean includes rather than is defined 

as.

 MR. BECKER: Well, I think we have to read 

the definitional regulations together. That is, all of 

the terms in the exemption, companionship services, 

babysitting services, casual basis, domestic service 

employment, are all defined in the set of regulations, 

point 3, point 4, point 5, point 6. And it is clear 

from the prefatory language of each one that what the 

Department of Labor intended to do was define the terms 

in the statute.

 And so when it said that that term refers 

to --

interesting when you look at -- I mean, they're -- it's 

a good point.  It's interesting when you look at the 

other definitions, the babysitting, it says this 

provision shall mean. Here it just says it refers to.

 Let's see, the other ones -- casual basis, 

shall mean. Companionship services, shall mean.

 This one doesn't say shall mean. It says it 

refers to this. I'm just wondering if that's something 

that suggests it's not intended to be as exclusive as 

the other definitions.

 MR. BECKER: I do not believe so, Your 

Honor. It is an exercise of the power to define the 

term and I don't think we can take that language "refers 

to" to be non-exclusive. When the Department said 

referred it was defining a statutory term as it said it 

was. If we have any doubt about what the Department 

intended, it actually of course reiterated that 

definition under the interpretive classification. And 

it again said that the term refers to, is defined as, 

employment by the household. If we had any doubt --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Becker --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There it says 

--there it says includes. And if you're talking about 

552.101, there it says the term includes persons 

frequently referred to as private household workers.

MR. BECKER: I'm referring to an earlier 

provision of the same regulation, not the reference to 

private household workers, but where it states that the 

definition includes those individuals who are employed 

by the household, that is in 552.101(a). But if we had 

any further doubt, the -- that regulation refers to, as 

its source of the language, the regulation adopted under 

the Social Security Act, now 20 CFR 404.1057. It was 

originally numbered differently, but at the time, in 

1974, that regulation which was explicitly the source of 

the language the Department of Labor used, said not 

once, not twice, but three times, that the individual 

had to be employed by the household.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. -- Mr. Becker, if 

there is room for the Agency to read this statute either 

way, one way that the third party employee would come 

under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the other that they 

would not, would be treated the same way as the person 

employed by the elderly person himself or herself, but 

if the concern of Congress in making this exemption was 

for the householder with limited funds, if the Agency is 

subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, it's going to 

end up being the householder paying for it anyway.

 So why isn't the most reasonable 

interpretation of what Congress meant by the exemption

that the exemption would apply across the board, so that 

all workers in this category would be exempt?

 MR. BECKER: Your Honor, setting aside, of 

course, all the reasons about Congress's intent in 552.3 

which we've already explained, we would not say that 

that there is any credible evidence in the legislative 

history or the text of the Act to suggest that cost was 

a factor.

 And let me explain why. The Department for 

the first time when it promulgated its advisory 

memorandum suggested this was the basis of the third 

party regulation. It said nothing of the sort in 1975. 

As support for the assertion it cited four isolated 

comments in the legislative history. None of them 

except the last -- and there is only one of t-h-e-m 

related in any way to the exemption. The one that 

related to the exemption in fact directly supports our 

position, because it describes those people who are not 

within the exemption as the professional domestics.

 So we don't think that there's any basis for 

suggesting that cost was the underlying rationale; and, 

in fact, it is really implausible. Because at the same 

time, for example, Congress extended the provisions of 

the Act which covered nursing homes. At the same time, 

as has been pointed out, Congress only exempted casual

concerned about cost, in creating this babysitter and 

companionship exemption, the primary intended 

beneficiaries of that would have been working families 

where both people worked and therefore who require a

authority and the more general authority to enact 

necessary rules and regulation. But, in fact, as 

Justice Breyer pointed out in his question, both grants 

of authority were invoked by the Department when it 

enacted both regulations simultaneously, not limited to 

either subpart A or subpart B, and for the reasons that 

Justice Alito points out, it is a very odd thing to 

attribute to the Department to say that it would 

exercise two different legislative powers in different 

parts of the -- of the regulations.

 There's no reason it would do that. The 

subpart B regulations clearly are regulations that 

delimit the terms of the exemption in 213(a)(15). 

There's no question about that. So why in fact if it 

was doing what Congress authorized it to do under 

213(a)(15), would it instead of relying on the grant of 

authority in that provision, rely on some other general 

grant of authority? It makes no logical sense to 

attribute that to the Department.

 And it seems to me, in -- excuse me -- in 

fact, that that argument points up one of the 

difficulties here. It seems to me that the arguments 

here are a way of simply trying to push the Department 

aside so that the courts can ultimately do the final job 

of exposition on this exemption. Not only contrary to

where is ambiguity in the statute, or room for 

interpretation, the agencies are given the opportunity 

to do that within reasonable bounds; it is also contrary 

to the statute.

 It is clear as I said at the beginning of my 

argument, the Department was the agency chosen by 

Congress to do the work of defining and delimiting the 

exception.
