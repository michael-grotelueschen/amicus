 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

McNellie, Rini, Kramer, & Ulrich.

 Mr. Russell.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. RUSSELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Congress rarely makes ignorance of the law a 

defense to civil liability, and the Fair Debt Collection 

Practices Act is no exception to that rule. While it 

may seem unfair to hold defendants in some sense 

strictly liable for legal mistakes in the civil context, 

the accumulated wisdoms of generations of legal practice 

has been that attempting to fix that unfairness through 

a mistake of law defense causes more harm than it 

prevents.

 And as a consequence, in light of that 

subtle understanding, courts should not read a Federal 

statute to establish a mistake of law defense, unless 

Congress quite plainly makes that intent to do so clear. 

And in this case, nothing in the text, structure, or the 

history of the bona fide error provision of the FDCPA

indicates such an intent.

 I could begin with the -- the text of the 

statute. It is not enough under the bona fide error 

provision that the defendant's violation be in good 

faith, that it have been bona fide.

 There is an additional element, that the 

defendant has to show that the violation was not 

intentional. And in common legal discourse, a violation 

is not rendered unintentional simply because the 

defendant misunderstood the legal consequences of its 

actions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think -- reading 

"intentional" the way you just articulated is absolutely 

right, but when you add -- I don't see what work "bona 

fide error" does in the statute, if "intentional" should 

be read in this case to mean what you say.

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, I think it captures the 

circumstance in which somebody makes a mistake of fact, 

but does so and with -- not in good faith. I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you say: Well, 

intentional means you meant to send out the document; 

you meant to serve it; in other words, no specific 

intent requirement. But if -- a bona fide error, it 

seems, doesn't make the activity not intentional under 

the traditional understanding of intentional.

MR. RUSSELL: But I think that's right. I 

think both provisions do separate work, and so that if 

all it took to show that something wasn't intentional is 

that you didn't mean to violate the law, it would be 

very difficult to understand what work "bona fide" was 

doing in that circumstance.

 And I think Congress included the bona fide 

requirement in order to capture instances in which 

people make factual mistakes, but not in good faith.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I really don't think that 

the -- the word that we're wrestling with here is the --

the word "intentional." It seems to me it's the word 

"violation," because violation -- when it says the 

violation was intentional or unintentional, does 

"violation" mean the act that constitutes a violation of 

the law, or does "violation" mean the -- the fact of 

violating the law?

 MR. RUSSELL: I think that is the central 

question here and it is Respondents' best argument. I 

think that the word "violation" is best understood to 

refer to the act. That is how this Court has construed 

that word in the statutory phrase "knowing violation" in 

a number of cases, and that's how the courts of appeals 

have construed the term "intentional" -- or "intentional 

violation" in the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural

Workers Protection Act, which we cited in our brief.

 I did mention in our brief that it is a less 

usual formulation, "intentional violation," and at the 

time we wrote our briefs we weren't able to find any 

cases from this Court construing that particular term.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So what -- the part that's 

worrying me most is where the lawyer is the debt 

collector. All right? So he's within the act, and he 

has a client of debt collectors, and the clients all 

say: Please go collect the debt. And they say: We 

want to do this, like in this -- suppose in this case, 

they say: Tell us if you don't owe it; ask them to 

write a letter to that effect; we won't collect it; now, 

is that legal?

 And the lawyer looks up everything in sight 

and says, yes, it's legal. And then that's what he 

thinks. All the circuits have said this. And then he 

asks the FTC and they say, yes, it's legal. So there he 

is. Everybody's told him it's legal. And lo and 

behold, this Court, surprisingly, holds the opposite. 

Well, he shouldn't be liable. And if he has to worry 

about that, he can never defend his client. The only 

answer is: Whatever the man says who is opposed to your 

client, that's what you have to do. That can't be the 

meaning of this statute.

MR. RUSSELL: Well, let me address the 

hypothetical, to make sure I understand it. If we're 

talking -- well, first of all, if we are talking about a 

case in which they've asked the opinion of the FTC, they 

are entitled to the safe harbor defense, because 

Congress specifically --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. What the FTC said 

is: We won't give you one.

 MR. RUSSELL: Okay. Well, in that 

circumstance, I think it's important to distinguish 

between lawyers who are simply giving advice to debt 

collector clients -- they're not covered by the act. 

It's only when the lawyer engages in debt collection 

activities himself. And a lot of the time the debt --

the lawyer is simply --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Does litigation constitute 

debt -- debt collection activity?

 MR. RUSSELL: Yes. This Court held in 

Heintz that litigation can be a form of --

JUSTICE BREYER: So he is a lawyer 

litigating for a client. That was my hypothetical.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. RUSSELL: In that circumstance -- in 

that circumstance, I think yes, the lawyer can be held

liable for -- for mistakes. But to the extent this 

Court --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's not a mistake. The 

point is, in a sense, that any decent lawyer would say 

that's what the law was; that sometimes lawyers get 

surprised because courts don't always act the way they 

think is reasonable.

 MR. RUSSELL: And when that happens, their 

clients are almost never protected from liability, for 

-- because they did what their lawyers reasonably told 

them to. And the antitrust --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why aren't they in good 

faith?

 MR. RUSSELL: The lawyer?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Both.

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, certainly, because there 

generally is a mistake of law defense.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, but that's in your view 

of it. I am saying that the opposite view of it is that 

your view of it puts lawyers in an impossible position, 

let alone the client.

 MR. RUSSELL: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: It -- it's not just that 

it's unfair. It's worse than unfair. The lawyer is 

under an obligation to represent his client, and he

cannot do anything but tell the client: Just pay money 

to this particular plaintiff whose view of the law is 

totally contrary to every circuit court that's ever 

decided it. Now, how can you put lawyers in that 

position?

 MR. RUSSELL: I think the lawyers are not in 

a terribly different position than is, for example, the 

executive of a company that has a fiduciary duty to its 

shareholders to maximize profits and is considering a 

venture that could violate the antitrust laws. And in 

that circumstance, they have to make a calculated 

judgment, because the antitrust laws don't have a 

mistake of law defense. And neither does any other 

civil --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you are sort of 

begging the question there. I mean, the antitrust laws 

also don't have a bona fide error defense, and the 

question is whether that includes a legal mistake 

defense.

 MR. RUSSELL: That's right. And my -- my 

point simply is that you shouldn't read that defense as 

necessarily creating a mistake of law defense simply 

because you think it's so unfair, because that 

unfairness is simply common.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But it -- but it suggests

that you would like a -- a sensible interpretation of 

this that avoids the result I said, if possible. And 

there is a different way of going about it, which is you 

could say that a bona fide error in respect to a lawyer 

imposes much higher standards on that lawyer than it 

does on most -- and it's simply a client -- that before 

you can call an error bona fide, that lawyer really has 

to look into it. He has to have asked the FTC. He has 

to have gotten -- and made an effort to get a letter 

back. And if there are one or two circuits that hold 

the other way, well, where? And if you don't, you are 

not bona fide.

 Now, that would get to virtually the same 

place but it would protect the lawyer against true legal 

surprise.

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, I do think that if you 

disagree with us, that's the better reading than the 

second. That's not the reading most courts have given. 

It's not the reading that the Sixth Circuit gave in this 

case.

 But I think there is every reason to think 

that if Congress was concerned about the especially 

problematic application of this statute to lawyer 

conduct and particularly to litigation conduct, it would 

have expected courts to deal with that in different way,

and not through the bona fide error defense, which, 

after all, applies to lawyer who are engaging in the 

same conduct as lay debt collectors and to nonlawyers 

alike. It's a very blunt instrument for dealing with 

this problem.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One -- one of the 

things you have to include on this initial communication 

is the name of the creditor, right?

 MR. RUSSELL: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So let's say 

the bank that is the creditor is being sold or taken 

over. And, you know, you have heard that, well, they 

have merged, but, you know, the closing date of the 

merger is two months later or whatever. It's just not 

clear what the name of the creditor is. So you -- you 

are not a lawyer, but you are trying to collect the 

debt, and you go -- you fill in, I -- it's either A or 

B, and you say: I think it's A, and you fill it in and 

it turns out that it's -- it's B. Let's say that's a 

bona fide error. Okay?

 But if you are sitting there as the debt 

collector and you say: I don't know if it's A or B. 

And you say: I know; I'll call the lawyer. You call 

the lawyer and the lawyer says: Oh, it's -- it's B -- I 

mean, it's -- it's A. And you put down A and it turns

out it's wrong, aren't -- you are in a worse position if 

you ask the lawyer than if you didn't, right?

 MR. RUSSELL: No, because in either 

circumstance it would be a factual error. It would be 

subject to the bona fide error defense.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it's a -- it's a 

legal -- the lawyer looks at it and says: Well, you 

know, the merger is not going to close for whatever, but 

I think it's still this bank.  And it turns out his 

legal analysis of who the creditor is was wrong.

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, again, I'm not sure that 

that's a legal -- but assuming that it is a legal 

mistake --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MR. RUSSELL: -- I think that the client is 

not -- I mean, if it's a legal mistake, it's a legal 

mistake for the client as well as the lawyer, and I 

think either one of them would be in the same position.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if the client 

just says: I'm not going to ask the lawyer; I'm just 

going to make -- I think it's A -- it's a bona fide 

error, but it's an error -- he gets the benefit of that 

position. But if he asks the lawyer, he doesn't get the 

benefit.

wouldn't get benefit under either circumstance, because 

it would be a mistake of law and the statute doesn't 

cover it.

 If I could finish my answer --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who the -- who the 

creditor is is necessarily a mistake of law, rather than 

fact?

 MR. RUSSELL: No. That's why I -- I 

initially told you I thought it was a mistake of fact, 

and that would be a mistake of fact for the lawyer or 

the client. And I think actually, in that scenario --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is it a 

mistake of fact if the lawyer does legal research to 

find it out?

says: Well, it depends upon the date of the closing of 

the merger, not the announcement.

concerned about applying the law to lawyers and to 

litigation, it's much more likely that Congress intended 

the Court to deal with that in a tailored way by 

interpreting the substantive provisions of the statute 

with that particular problem in mind.

 Knowing that Congress didn't have litigation 

conduct specifically in mind when it enacted this 

statute, because at the time lawyers were excluded from 

the act altogether, and keeping in mind in addition that 

Congress presumably didn't intend the act to 

unreasonably interfere with litigation collection 

methods, and the constitutional aspects --

JUSTICE BREYER: So how -- how do we do 

that? Because you see, you are quite right. The client 

runs the same risk in antitrust law in a whole other lot 

of areas. Absolutely right. But once you bring the 

lawyer into it, the lawyer has what he doesn't have in 

an antitrust case under your reading, which is an 

incentive to distort the law in order to protect his own 

pocketbook. And that is, to me, a big problem.

 So you say there is -- there is a -- a way 

around that. And what?

 MR. RUSSELL: And that is to recognize that, 

as this Court held in Heintz, that Congress didn't 

intend for every unsuccessful lawsuit to result in

liability under this statute. Plaintiffs have to point 

to some particular provision of the statute that was 

violated by what the lawyer did in litigation.

 And for example, the lawyer makes a mistake 

about the statute of limitations. Some courts have held 

that that constitutes a violation of the provisions 

against deceptive practices or unconscionable collection 

practices --

JUSTICE BREYER: The lawyer writes a letter 

to the client. The first thing the lawyer tries to do 

is to settle the case. "Dear Client: Please send me 

the money, and by the way, if you don't owe it, tell me 

in writing."

 Okay? That's what the lawyer does. That's 

a legal activity. It's at the heart of practicing law, 

because nobody goes to court anymore. And -- though he 

will, if necessary, so he's part of this.

 Now, how do we get out of this problem that 

I'm putting? I'm really looking for an answer to that, 

because I think it's a big problem.

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, typically -- I don't 

know that that's a uniquely lawyerly activity. Lay debt 

collectors do that all the time.

 But to the extent you think that Congress 

could not have intended that kind of activity to be

subject to liability when somebody makes a reasonable 

legal error, I think it's more likely that Congress 

intended you to look at what provision of the statute 

are they saying was violated and construe that provision 

in a way that is consistent with your expectations about 

what Congress would have meant, rather than providing --

rather than, you know, taking the bona fide error 

provision to do that work, when the bona fide error 

provision is much broader and would apply to all kinds 

of mistakes of law, including having this consequence of 

basically giving debt collectors the opportunity to take 

the narrowest possible construction of -- of consumers' 

rights, as long as the -- the question is unsettled.

 The other reason to think that Congress 

wouldn't have intended this to be the solution to that 

problem is that at the time they wrote the bona fide 

error defense, lawyers weren't included, so this could 

not have been Congress' intended solution to that 

particular problem.

 And at the time Congress used this language, 

it was borrowing it from the Truth in Lending Act, where 

it had an established meaning in the circuit courts as 

not including the mistake of law defense, and that 

remained the interpretation of the Fair Debt Collection 

Practices Act provision as well, for -- for nearly

 It wasn't until 2002 that the court of 

appeals first suggested that it did not extend to legal 

mistakes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, if the district 

court were to say: You violated the act; this was a 

mistake of law not covered, but I'm not awarding 

statutory damages because --

MR. RUSSELL: I think they --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in this case, just 

for the reasons here, you did something the Sixth 

Circuit -- or that the circuit law said was permissible, 

so you didn't do it -- you did it intentionally because 

you did the violation of the act, but it was based on a 

mistake of law.

 MR. RUSSELL: I do think that that's a 

perfectly permissible exercise of discretion. Congress 

gave the district court discretion with respect to 

statutory damages, and that's another way of dealing 

with this problem.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about 

attorneys' fees?

 MR. RUSSELL: No, the attorneys' fees is not 

discretionary in that sense.

though, to think that Congress knew how to make a 

mistake of law defense clearly and did not do so here.

 Congress did provide, in effect, a mistake 

of law defense to civil penalties. The civil penalties 

provision that applies to this statute, which is at 

15 U.S.C. 45(m)(1), and that's quoted in relevant part 

on page 24 of the blue brief, provides for very serious 

civil penalties for somebody who acts with actual 

knowledge or knowledge fairly implied that the act was 

prohibited.

 And I think that provision shows two things. 

One, it shows that Congress knows how to make an 

express -- how to expressly speak to a defendant's 

knowledge of the unlawfulness of his conduct.

 And in addition, it shows that Congress 

treated knowledge of unlawfulness as an aggravating 

circumstance, as something deserving of special 

punishment, rather than, as Respondents would have it, 

most of the time being a minimum prerequisite for any 

liability at all.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Congress wrote this 

statute to -- to have a cottage industry of litigation. 

These were attorneys --

a way, to encourage private enforcement, to be sure.  It 

enacted statutory damages and fee shifting because it 

understood that this was an industry in which there was 

a particular risk of very aggressive and harmful 

practices, in part because debt collectors don't rely on 

the good will of the consumers they deal with in order 

to prosper. And so all of the economic incentives in 

the industry push people to aggressive practices, and 

Congress wanted this statute to be a counterweight to 

that.

 And as in many circumstances, Congress 

enacts statutory language and puts up requirements and 

holds people to them civilly because the -- the general 

rule in our legal system is that the risk and the cost 

of a legal mistake is generally allocated to the 

lawbreaker in the civil context and not to the people's 

whose rights have been violated. And there is no reason 

to think that Congress was acting particularly 

differently here.

 We were speaking earlier on about the words 

"intentional violation," and I wanted to bring to the 

Court's attention the fact that after we filed our 

brief, and in fact, last night, we -- we did find a case 

in which this Court construed that term, and we notified 

Respondents' counsel and the United States. And I just

want to give you the cite so you can look at it. It's 

Ellis v. United States, 206 U.S. 246. The relevant 

passage is at page 257. It's a 1907 opinion from 

Justice Holmes.

 And it's consistent with the way that the 

Court has construed the phrase "knowing violation" in a 

number of contexts, including in -- in the criminal 

context, where it's much more common for Congress to 

make a mistake of law a defense to liability.

 I mentioned before that that kind of history 

of the development of the statute -- I think it's also 

worth noting, Justice Breyer, that at the time, Congress 

withdrew the attorney exemption from the act. It was 

the uniform opinion of the courts of appeals at that 

time and all the district courts that the language of 

the bona fide error defense did not create a mistake of 

law defense. And again, Congress had no reason to 

expect that in subjecting the attorneys to that 

statutory regime, that the bona fide error provision 

would be the solution to any special problems.

 And Congress has also shown itself to be 

attentive to this special area of concern. In 2006, it 

made a tailored adjustment to the statute to make clear 

that pleadings are not an initial communication 

triggering the validation notice requirement. And I

think that demonstrates that Congress is -- is on top of 

this issue, and it stands at the ready to make 

adjustments that are necessary to make this legal system 

operate in a way that both makes sense, but nonetheless 

gives effect to their intent to treat attorney debt 

collectors on a par with regular debt collectors who are 

not attorneys.

 I should also mention, Justice Breyer, to 

the extent there are some really intractable problems 

with respect to the act application to attorneys, 

there -- there is ongoing litigation in the lower courts 

about the Noerr-Pennington doctrine about how the 

constitutional implications of regulating in-court 

activity apply to the Court's interpretation of the 

statutory provisions.

 And again, I think it's more likely that 

that is the solution Congress would have intended, an 

interpretive solution --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, maybe your colleague 

can, but how -- so they define a -- the reasonable error 

falls in is because he's a person who regularly collects 

or attempts to collect consumer debts owed to a -- you 

know, owed to another person. That's pretty broad. 

That doesn't come about until '86. You are saying the 

bona fide language there is before, in '77?

statutes of limitations. I think it's very open to 

dispute whether attempting to collect a debt on which

deceptive practice, because there's not a -- all it does

MR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I would like, if I may, to pick up with a 

point that Mr. Russell made, which is that the FDCPA is 

of a piece with most civil regulatory statutes, in that 

it makes knowledge of the law an aggravating factor and 

subjects violators who know that they are violating a 

law subject to substantial civil penalties of up to 

$16,000 per day. But it doesn't completely excuse 

violations based on a lack of knowledge of the law. In 

order to be excused, the violation must have resulted 

from a bona fide error and meet all three elements of 

the bona fide error defense.

 We think that two of those elements are not 

satisfied by the Respondents' error in this case.

 First, legal errors, for the reason Mr. 

Russell explained, aren't unintentional. Justice Scalia 

asked about whether the phrase "the violation is not 

intentional" is a signal in that respect. We think that 

the work that that phrase, "the violation was not 

intentional," does in this circumstance is to show that 

the portion of the debt collector's conduct that 

triggers the violation of the statute, it was -- is what 

must be unintentional.

 Let me illustrate that with an example.

Under the statute, a debt collector who places a call to 

a debtor at home after 9:00 at night may well violate 

the statute; likely does violate the statute. So what 

must be unintentional for that debt collector to make 

out the bona fide error defense is not that the 

telephone call had been -- had been placed 

unintentionally, but rather that the debt collector 

didn't have knowledge, for example, because of an error 

about what time zone the debtor lives in.

 The -- the debt collector didn't know that 

the call was being placed after 9:00 at night. That is 

an unintentional error, and it is excused under the 

statute if the debt collector can also show that it 

maintains procedures reasonably adapted to prevent any 

such errors.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And your example of that 

couldn't happen, because if you were calling debtors, 

you should certainly check what time of evening the call 

is. So you get over the first problem, but then on the 

second problem, the second -- how could that possibly be 

careful procedure, if you don't even check to see what 

time zone the person is in?

 MR. JAY: Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, 

if -- if you check, but due to a keyboarding error, for 

example, Arizona is entered as Alabama or an error in

time zone is entered in whatever record is being 

consulting by the debt collector, that's the kind of 

factual error, a clerical, bookkeeping type error 

that -- that Congress had in mind when it created this 

defense. And it bears repeating that Congress has 

created this -- this defense in identical terms in a 

number of other statutes; federal agencies have 

construed the identical language in a number of other 

statutes. And never has Congress or a federal agency 

contemplated that one of these defenses would, in fact, 

encompass legal errors.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know why when 

Congress codified that law errors don't count, codified 

that for the Truth in Lending Act purposes, it didn't 

make the corresponding change in the others?

 MR. JAY: We don't have a specific 

indication, Justice Ginsburg, why it didn't go back and 

revise every other statute that -- that already had such 

a defense. But I think that the answer is simply that 

Congress was revising the Truth in Lending Act in a 

statute called the Truth in Lending Simplification Act, 

and the -- the statute in which that was passed didn't 

make any other -- any other changes to non-financial 

statutes. It didn't reopen the Federal -- Fair Debt 

Collection Practice Act in any other way. In fact, the

relevant portion of the FDCPA, Section 1692k, hasn't 

been amended in any way since Congress first enacted it 

in 1977.

 So we think that the relevance of the 1980 

amendment to TILA is simply this: It's part of a 

consistent pattern by Congress and by the agencies such 

as the Department of Housing and Urban Development and 

the Federal Reserve Board that interpret statutes with 

identical or very similar bona fide error provisions to 

say: Errors of law are not what Congress or the agency 

had in mind.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Even if the -- even if the 

error of law is completely reasonable? Let's say in 

this case the Sixth Circuit had a case directly on 

point. Still, it was just too bad.

 MR. JAY: Well, I think, Justice Alito, 

that that is not uncommon under any civil statute, that 

when a court of appeals has precedent on point, that 

there is always a possibility that that precedent will 

be reversed.

 Now, of course, this statute has a very 

short statute of limitations. It's one year. And if 

there's some possibility that the law will change down 

the road, that short statute of limitations will prevent 

most violations from being reconsidered down the road

 MR. JAY: Well, the debt collection industry

Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And why is that? 

Because it's a little difficult dealing with the FTC 

bureaucracy and getting an answer from them in a 

reasonable time?

 MR. JAY: I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that 

first, even if this were relevant to what Congress 

intended the -- how Congress intended the adviser 

opinion process to work when it wrote this provision in 

1977, that the debt collection industry, as we pointed 

out in our brief -- if you ask the FTC for an adviser 

opinion, and it sides against the requester, which, 

incidentally, in none of these four opinions has it ever 

done -- in each case it sided with the requester -- but 

if it sides against, then the requester is on notice of 

the law. And the requester is going to be -- as I 

mentioned at the outset, the requester is going to be in 

the category of -- for heightened penalties, because it 

will be very difficult to suggest that you don't know 

the law.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are saying 

that the debt collection industry doesn't does ask the 

FTC, which would be a safe harbor for them, because if 

they get a bad answer, they may not follow it and then 

they may be subject to heightened penalties?

 MR. JAY: Well, I'm saying, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that the -- that they would 

understandably prefer to ask their own lawyer for an 

opinion if the -- if this Court were to agree with the 

Respondent's position and affirm the Sixth Circuit. 

They would be able to ask their own lawyer, get a 

private opinion, and if the opinion is favorable, then 

they are home free under the bona fide error defense.

 If -- if it's an -- if it's adverse advice, 

they may need -- even if they disregard the advice, they 

may never need to disclose the opinion at all, whereas 

the FTC advisory opinion process clarifies the law for 

the benefit of the entire field. Those opinions are 

public. They are published and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there are 

four of them. I don't care how public they are. There 

are four of them over the past 10 years. It's not a 

very reliable or usable effort to clarify the law and

that you can't look simply at the number of responses 

without looking at the number of inquiries. And I am 

confident that if this Court, as we urge that it do, 

reverses the Sixth Circuit and makes clear that asking 

your own lawyer for an opinion is not going to be a safe 

harbor defense under Subsection C, that there will be 

increased use of the -- of the safe harbor defense that 

Congress actually wrote into the statute in Subsection 

E.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we know what the time 

interval was? You said there were seven requests for 

affirmative responses. How long did it take from when 

the request was made until the FTC responded?

 MR. JAY: In the four that were granted, 

three of them took three to four months. The fourth is 

an exception, and that -- that's the one cited in the 

retail collection attorneys' amicus brief.

 That is an exception because the request was 

originally submitted as a comment in a pending 

rulemaking conducted by the FTC and a number of other 

agencies. The FTC agreed to take that comment in the 

rulemaking and act on it an advisory opinion under the 

FDCPA so that it wouldn't have to wait for the other 

agencies to agree with its view, and so that one took 

considerably longer. But the average processing time is

three to four months.

 And of course the FTC makes a number of 

other informal guidance avenues available, if what the 

debt collector wants is simply a quick answer and not a 

formal safe harbor with the imprimatur of the 

Commission. One can -- the Commission staff has 

published guidance, and indeed, the Commission staff is 

available over the telephone --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if that's wrong, 

it doesn't do you any good.

 MR. JAY: If that's wrong, it doesn't confer 

the safe harbor. But that's up to the debt collector, 

Mr. Chief Justice. If you -- if you want an informal 

opinion, you can get one very quickly. If you want the 

safe harbor, that requires the imprimatur of the 

commissioners, and that takes a bit longer.

 We don't think that's at all inconsistent 

with what Congress intended, and we do think that 

Congress intended that this be the primary avenue. And 

if you look at the advisory opinion provision of the 

Truth in Lending Act, we think that illustrates it.

 At the time Congress enacted the FDCPA, the 

Truth in Lending Act advisory opinion provision had only 

been on the books for a couple of years, but it had 

already filled more than 100 pages of the Code of

Federal Regulations with advisory opinions. And we 

think that that's how Congress intended for the law 

under this statute to be clarified as well, not in a way 

that effectively confers qualified immunity on debt 

collectors whenever there is an ambiguity in the law.

 We think that that is reinforced as well by 

a substantive aspect of the statute, which is that 

Congress recognized -- and this is in particular in the 

legislative history at page 18 in footnote 9 of our 

brief -- that the debt collection industry is extremely 

aggressive and looks for loopholes whenever they exist.

 So the substantive prohibitions of the 

statute, especially 1692d, e, and f, are written in such 

a way that they contain broad, substantive prohibitions 

that are illustrated by examples, but those examples 

expressly are illustrative and not exclusive. Congress 

would not have wanted a debt collector to be able to 

say: Well, gee, this -- this practice is not expressly 

addressed by the statute and has not yet expressly been 

addressed by any judicial opinion, and to say: Well, 

that law is not clearly established.

 We think it's -- may I finish the 

sentence Mr. Chief Justice? We think, instead, that 

Congress would have recognized that the purpose of this 

statute is to protect the unsophisticated debtor, and

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE S. COAKLEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. COAKLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The starting point for discerning 

congressional intent is the text of the statute. The 

Respondents submit that in a review of the text of this 

statute, all of the components may be read plainly to 

include the bona fide error defense, to include legal 

error, starting with the words that the Court was 

discussing with Mr. Russell and Mr. Jay, "violation not 

intentional," moving on to "violation resulting from a 

bona fide error," then "the maintenance of procedures 

reasonably adapted."

 The Sixth Circuit and the trial court and --

have construed this statute in a plain-meaning analysis; 

that is to say, they start with the plain meaning of 

each of those words and construe them in their context. 

They did not find an ambiguity. They did not find an

absurdity. They found that each of those -- each of 

those components may be squared with a -- with a legal 

error analysis.

 Petitioner even concedes with respect to the 

element of "violation not intentional" that our 

interpretation is, quote, "not linguistically 

impossible," end quote.

 What -- what Petitioner has done is to avoid 

the conventional standards of -- of congressional -- I 

mean, of statutory interpretation, which is the 

plain meaning from Lamie, and moving, then, outward if 

necessary. And they have opted instead for looking at 

unrelated statutes such as TILA, then going to the safe 

harbor, and then pulling the words "violation" and 

"intentional" out of the first prong, taking them out of 

context, taking them out of order, and then applying 

them to this maxim, "ignorance of the law." Even --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And also saying -- and 

then this sentence is what I would like to have your 

response on, that there is no statute -- Federal statute 

that makes mistake of law a defense. So this would be 

highly extraordinary, and if that's what Congress meant 

to do, to make something that ordinarily is no defense a 

defense, we would expect Congress to do so expressly.

their argument, that it is unprecedented. But their 

unprecedented argument gets them nowhere. That is one 

of the panoply of arguments that is outside the plain 

meaning that they go to to say well, this is 

unprecedented; Congress couldn't have intended this.

 There are reports that read the TILA bona 

fide error to mean legal error at one point in time, so 

it wasn't unprecedented to the extent of that, and what 

did Congress do with respect to TILA? In 1980, they 

didn't like the interpretation that they were getting 

with respect to legal error from the TILA error, which 

is a totally different statute, and so they reacted by 

amending TILA to say no legal error in TILA.

 They did not correspondingly amend the 

FDCPA, which shows Congress's intent to distinguish the 

two statutes.

Heintz decision, that they intended for debt collectors 

to have an automatic defense if they just called up a

Heintz decision which made lawyers debt collectors, and 

so now we are in this quandary about a lawyer's good 

faith. But -- but if we start with what was understood 

at the time, do you think that this language was 

intended to give debt collectors immunity by simply 

calling a lawyer?

 MR. COAKLEY: Well -- it was absolutely 

meant to protect debt collectors, however, that term was 

defined in 1977, which included lay debt collectors. In 

1986 it went up a level when we added lawyers, and the 

exemption went out and in 1995 it went up another level 

when we added litigating lawyers.

 But most certainly it went back to 1977 and 

included lay debt collectors, and lay debt collectors 

didn't get a "get out of jail free" card here by just 

pulling up the bona fide error defense and saying I'm 

done. They are subject to the three rigors of the bona 

fide error defense. They have to prove that the 

violation was not intentional -- that the violation --

MR. COAKLEY: No, but --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even if the lawyer made 

a mistake, if the debt collector relies, you know, I 

have a reputable law firm, they are well educated, they 

tell me they do legal research, that -- I can assume 

that, so why don't I have a "get out of jail" card?

 MR. COAKLEY: The unfairness of this 

statute, as Justice Breyer indicated in his commentary 

with Mr. Russell, is -- is exemplified by your question. 

If a lay debt collector calls a lawyer in the 1977 to 

1986 round and asks a lawyer for an interpretation of 

this act, and he base -- he relies upon that and acts 

accordingly, per their interpretation only applying to 

clerical error, that lay debt collector who relied upon 

advice of counsel is out of luck if the decision goes 

against the lay debt collector, because he or she has no 

error of law as a defense. So it goes up, the levels of 

unfairness go up as the time goes on.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's true of antitrust 

defendants, too.

 MR. COAKLEY: But in this, Your Honor, there 

is a -- there is a bona fide error defense that has been 

crafted into this statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I see that. Is it --

is it -- what do you think of the idea that your

opponent here has suggested that the way to deal with 

the lawyer's problem that I mentioned is simply read the 

substantive provisions, so that there is no violation 

for ordinary legal activity where they have gone and 

asked the FTC or you know, all the things that are 

against them? What you would have to do.

 That isn't so hard to do as I first thought, 

because the words that seem to make -- the primary words 

of what is outlawed are the words "unfair or 

unconscionable means." Now I -- I doubt -- you would 

know -- I doubt that there are other words in the 

statute that forbid lawyers from doing anything that 

really shouldn't be forbidden. I mean, they shouldn't 

call people up in the middle of the night and harass 

them and so forth.

 But -- but you could read unfair and 

unconscionable means to say that where a lawyer is 

really hit by surprise, you know, all the circuits were 

against him, the FTC wouldn't give him an opinion, that 

he no longer is acting unfairly and unconscionably. 

What about that?

 MR. COAKLEY: Justice Breyer, I don't think 

that gives credence to the 1977 focus when lawyers were 

not part of the statute. Certainly your example 

heightens the unfairness of it once lawyers come in in

1995 through Heintz as a litigating lawyer. Certainly a 

lawyer has -- it creates this irreconcilable conflict of 

interest that you alluded to in your discussion with Mr. 

Russell. That puts the lawyer between the proverbial 

rock and a hard place. He either -- he or she either 

chooses to follow the law and risk --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's right. I was seeing 

a special problem with lawyers.  Call -- the unfairness 

problem that you are talking about, call that the 

antitrust problem, because it is just as much. But I 

saw the special problem of putting the lawyer in the 

impossible situation that you've just described.

 Now it's with respect to that problem that 

he offers the cure of reading the words "unconscionable" 

and what is it? "Unconscionable and unfair means." 

Read those words to exempt the lawyer when he's in the 

dilemma I discussed, and therefore the lawyer will not 

have an incentive to -- to skew his advice.

 MR. COAKLEY: I believe that the lawyer 

would be just subject to the rigors of the bona fide 

error defense, the way any other debt collector as 

defined from 1977 forward would be.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose it would 

make interpretation of the act a little more difficult.

somebody else does it, you know, two weeks later, that 

doesn't have the same -- he says, well, look, it's not 

unconscionable, but it turns out it is, in his case.

 And it would have to be -- the opinion would 

have to clarify the law by saying, this is normally 

unconscionable but we are going to say it's not here 

because of this activity that is unlikely to happen.

 MR. COAKLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, I believe 

this would be part of the inquiry that a lawyer would be 

faced in trying to prove the affirmative defense of bona 

fide error in a legal situation, and that -- that would 

be part of the good faith analysis, part of the 

reasonable procedures that he would present to the 

court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could we do that in the 

context of this case? Because we are talking on a 

highly abstract level. This is a statute that required 

a validation notice, and for the most part the 

validation notice that was sent to the debtor is exactly 

the words of the statute.

 But the lawyer added two words that are not 

in this statute, "in writing." Where did that come 

from? We are told this was not the model form that was

the statute had the words in writing, does the first

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Coakley, one of your 

earlier statements confused me. You relied upon the 

fact that TILA was amended in 1980 to provide that legal 

errors are not covered by the TILA defense, and I think 

you -- I think you describe that as -- as changing the 

law to -- to provide that -- that legal errors were not 

covered.

 But as I understood the situation, every 

court of appeals to have construed TILA prior to 1980 

had held that legal errors were not -- were not 

included, as -- as your opponent says, they are not 

included here. So the amendment to TILA was just an 

affirmation of the judicial interpretation of the 

language similar to the language here.

 MR. COAKLEY: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then your 

prior statement was very misleading.

 MR. COAKLEY: Well, to the extent that there 

were two different -- two different analyses or 

interpretations that had emerged before 1980 that led 

the Congress to -- in 1980, enact or to amend TILA, 

otherwise, as pointed out in the Herrera case in our 

brief, if everything was so settled in 1980, why would 

there be a need to clarify the definition of bona fide 

error under TILA, and -- and if it was clarified in 1980 

under the FDCPA, then why didn't they take the step and 

clarify it in the FDCPA from 1980 to 2010, especially 

when Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA: There is no basis for 

saying that the amendment was overturning -- changing 

the prior meaning of TILA. There is no basis for saying 

that. All you had were just a few district court 

opinions, and all the courts of appeals have come out 

the other way.

 MR. COAKLEY: Your Honor, the -- the 

Petitioner's position was that the case law was uniform 

at the time, and our position is the case law was not

uniform at the time. There were cases that had taken an 

opposite approach to the court of appeals decision on --

on TILA, and that is what led to Congress reacting in 

1980 to specifically exclude legal error from the TILA 

defense and has -- Congress has --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why doesn't that just 

mean that Congress wants to confirm that the judges --

the majority of judges who -- who had held that it 

didn't -- that errors of law were not a defense, that 

they were right, it's not changing -- changing anything. 

It's just confirming that the majority view is right.

 MR. COAKLEY: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the 

case law says that the law has to be settled, and as we 

pointed out in our brief, it was not settled, and the 

courts, afterwards, have reflected that there was no 

settlement, and that that's one of the reasons why the 

error portion of the TILA bona fide error was -- was 

clarified, as the Petitioner puts it, to say this 

excludes any interpretations of legal -- of legal -- of 

the legal interpretations of TILA.

 And then there was no -- whether you call it 

a clarification, whether you call it a ratification, 

whether you call it an amendment, it doesn't matter, 

Congress didn't then similarly amend the FDCPA to be

 MR. COAKLEY: Justice Ginsburg, I believe 

that the -- the words "bona fide error" in the TILA 

statute were being construed, although not by courts of 

appeals, to reasonably read the bona fide error 

encompasses legal error.

 There was a change -- change -- a 

clarification, whatever, in 1980, to specifically say, 

bona fide error does not include legal interpretations 

of TILA, and that was then never clarified, ratified, or 

whatever, nothing was done to the FDCPA at that time,

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that a -- a 

mistake of law has to be substantively reasonable in 

order to fall within this defense, and if so, where do 

you get that? Where do you find that in the statute?

 MR. COAKLEY: The statute doesn't refer to 

substantively or procedurally, Justice Alito, the 

statute refers to bona fide error and the maintenance of 

procedures reasonably adapted. As a -- as a -- as 

either a lay debt collector or as a lawyer debt 

collector, they must establish good faith in attempting 

to comply with the law as it existed at the time.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose that a lawyer 

spends a whole week researching a question, but arrives 

at a conclusion that is plainly incorrect, does not, 

therefore, intend to violate the statute and proceeds in 

good faith. Would that -- how would that work out?

preponderance of the evidence. If he doesn't prove all 

of the prongs, he's out. If he proves all of the 

prongs, he's in, and if he creates an issue of fact on 

one of the three prongs, than he's going back to the 

district court for a fact-finding analysis, which turns 

out to be the -- you know, this statute has not proved 

to be unworkable.

 And if I could follow up to Justice Scalia's 

and Justice Ginsburg's query about the -- the -- and 

Justice Sotomayor's -- about the interpretation of the 

words "TILA" versus "FDCPA," I think a review of the 

cases of the Seventh and Tenth Circuits is instructive 

because the Seventh Circuit was one of the circuits 

that, under TILA, had -- had interpreted the word to 

mean clerical error only. The Tenth Circuit -- and the 

tenth circuit as well.

 Now, today, under interpreting the FDCPA 

bona fide error, they have abrogated that meaning in 

TILA and have come around to this means legal error 

under the FDCPA.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Could you answer one 

question -- I'm just a little confused about. One 

statute has the defense in expressly. The other

reason why Congress would have wanted to provide a 

mistake of law defense under TILA and not in this --

this -- in this case? Why would it treat them 

differently?

 MR. COAKLEY: There -- there are 

differences -- substantial differences, Justice Stevens, 

in the TILA and in the FDCPA statute, starting with the 

purposes of the statute, starting with the construction 

of the statute, one, TILA has a criminal liability, TILA 

has life lines that the debt collector doesn't have in 

the FDCPA, TILA dealing -- is dealing with disclosure of 

financial information, TILA has regulations, as opposed 

to no regulations --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I would think all -- which 

way do these cut? I mean, the fact that there is 

criminal liability under TILA would seem to me to cut in 

precisely the opposite direction. You would want to 

provide excuses of bona fide errors of law, I would 

think. Why -- am I missing something here?

 MR. COAKLEY: The -- no, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would think --

MR. COAKLEY: It's a -- it's a distinction 

between why -- in trying to answer Justice Stevens' 

question, it's a distinction why TILA would be 

interpreted differently by the -- than the FDCPA.

there a greater need for the mistake of law defense 

under one statute, rather than the other, I sort of --

MR. COAKLEY: Given --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- have the same problem 

Justice Scalia expressed.

 MR. COAKLEY: Given -- well, given the 

purpose of TILA, and TILA dealing with computational 

errors, regulation C, Truth in Lending, they -- they 

amend -- they amended TILA -- I mean, I'm sorry. 

Originally TILA didn't have a bona fide error and then 

they amended it so as to -- before it was enacted -- so 

as to cover this area to provide for the computational 

error. Because it's so fraught with mathematical errors 

and the like.

 That is not the situation in the FDCPA. And 

that is precisely the reasoning that is the Seventh and 

Tenth Circuit have noted, and the case of Frye that we 

have cited in our brief has noted, as the distinction 

between these two statutes, and why one could be 

interpreted this way and the FDCPA could be reasonably 

interpreted the other way.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I -- but I share 

Justice Scalia's concern, I mean the -- the ways in 

which they are different would suggest you need the 

legal mistake defense more in TILA than you do in the 

FDCPA.

 MR. COAKLEY: Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I 

don't believe that that is consistent with the purpose 

of -- of TILA. And certainly lawyers are not -- lawyers 

are not creditors under TILA. And -- so that's a 

distinction between the -- the two statutes. And 

further, the -- there is an administrative penalty under 

the FDCPA that -- the $16,000 a day, but the bona fide 

error does not apply to that. So there is no 

inconsistency between the administrative penalties under 

the FDCPA and the civil penalties under the FDCPA.

 And in -- and in truth, the -- the statutes 

are -- are significantly different.

consistent on this point, and as admitted to by the 

Petitioners, there have been four advisory opinions from

 JUSTICE BREYER: How many have asked?

 MR. COAKLEY: I don't know how many have 

asked.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it seems to me 

that's the obvious solution to the problem, that --

until you hold they are not -- they are liable for 

mistake of law, but anyone can write to the FTC ahead of 

time and -- and get a safe harbor.

 It's -- so I don't know what we could do to 

suggest maybe that mechanism, which is built into the 

statute, should be used.

 MR. COAKLEY: I think that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't Mr. Jay tell us 

there were seven requests? Are you disputing that?

 MR. COAKLEY: I am not disputing that, 

Justice Ginsburg. What I am basically saying is it 

really doesn't make any difference, because the truth 

with respect to the FTC and the safe harbor defense and 

the FDCPA, that Mr. Jay does not argue that one is 

superfluous to the other; the Petitioner argues that one 

makes the other superfluous -- neither are superfluous 

to the other.

if you do say there is -- unless you have mistake of law 

defense, aren't going to happen. Because all that has 

to happen is that people write to the FTC and they get

its face applies prospectively. The FDCPA bona fide 

error defense --

defense applies retrospectively.

your request.

 MR. COAKLEY: I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is not an 

atypical issue in dealing with government agencies.

 MR. COAKLEY: And -- yes, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and the penultimate paragraph in there: For the 

foregoing reasons your request for advisory opinion does

not satisfy either the prerequisites described, well --

and accordingly we can't -- grant it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Coakley, why do you 

need a safe harbor if there is no store? I mean what is 

the purpose of -- of having this procedure, however 

inefficient it may be, what is the purpose of having it 

unless you were going to be liable if you make a mistake 

of law?

 MR. COAKLEY: The safe harbor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You are talking about a 

safe harbor rule. Leave the harbor.

 MR. COAKLEY: Justice Scalia, as it worked 

out the safe harbor is neither safe nor a harbor, but 

that's not the perspective that we have to look at it. 

We have to look at it from 1997, it was for a 

prospective course of conduct that gives the debt 

collector categorical --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What does that have to do 

-- what does that have to do with anything, whether it's 

prospective or not? The point is what benefit does it 

give to the person who is asking? If the person is not 

going to be liable for a bona fide mistake, why would he 

ever use it?

 MR. COAKLEY: Well, there are reasons why a 

debt collector may use it if he has time and he needs

the prospective letter from the FTC. In -- in reality 

debt collector's going to go to the bona fide error 

because it's retrospective, although there is risk with 

the bona fide error, because it's not the categorical 

immunity that the safe harbor gives. And there's --

they're not inconsistent.

 The safe harbor is not a --a statutory 

interpretation why you should drive a meaning into the 

bona fide error provision that is not apparent on its 

face.

 I would say in closing that Justice Breyer, 

your -- your comments earlier are just right. This is 

worse -- a reading, the safe harbor, reading the bona 

fide error provision to exclude legal error is worse 

than unfair.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, now I do see -- which 

is why I asked the question, I asked to get an answer, 

and the answer now seems to be floating around the FTC 

idea. It's -- seven letters, that isn't very much. I 

just wonder if the -- if the bar in this area, and their 

clients, if they made an effort, might be able to get 

the financing for the FTC so they could have enough 

people to respond quickly to the letter.

question about unprecedented. In -- in truth, what 

would really be unprecedented here would be for this 

Court to construe the bona fide error defense so that a 

lawyer or a debt collector who is giving advice to his 

client to follow a particular way of action, and the law 

was unsettled, for that lawyer to be subject to -- to be 

punished for personal liability. And we think that the 

bona fide error clearly under Lamie encompasses --

JUSTICE SCALIA: There are severe limits on 

the liability, aren't there? Isn't there a thousand --

isn't it a $1,000 limit?

 MR. COAKLEY: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not big bucks for an 

attorney, is it?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. COAKLEY: But let that -- well, maybe 

for the prior group that was up here, but I don't --

(Laughter.)

 MR. COAKLEY: It's big in Cleveland.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This isn't -- this is a 

class action, wasn't it? It was brought as a class 

action?

 MR. COAKLEY: This is definitely a class 

action. This is a class action that wants all of the 

validation notices that were sent out by this law firm

to -- that included the words "in writing" in it for 

that period, and further than that, they wanted the 

financial information from the law firm, the financials 

because, under the class action provision, it's $500,000 

or 1% of the net worth of the firm, which is ever less.

 So the request was made of my client, give 

me the financials of your law firm, and for some reason, 

my client did, but this -- the statute was not meant to 

punish lay debt collectors, including lawyers.

 The bona fide error defense is the shield, 

and we ask the court to affirm the judgment of the Sixth 

Circuit Court of Appeals.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.
