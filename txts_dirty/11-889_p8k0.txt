3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

4 argument next this morning in Case 11-889, Tarrant 

Regional Water District v. Herrmann. 

6  Mr. Rothfeld? 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

11  In the Red River Compact, Oklahoma agreed 

12 that Texas would be allowed to use a specified quantity 

13 of water that is located in Oklahoma. Oklahoma is now 

14 trying to back out of that bargain. 

What its argument to this Court in support 

16 of its position is essentially that the Court should 

17 disregard language that appears in the Red River Compact 

18 because that language is superfluous, that the Court 

19 should read into the Compact language that does not 

appear there, and that the Court should not give the 

21 text of the Compact what Oklahoma in its brief describes 

22 as "talismanic significance." 

23  Our very different view is that the plain 

24 text of the Compact must control. 

Now, in the Red River Compact, Texas and 

3

Official 

1 Oklahoma, along with Louisiana and Arkansas, agreed to 

2 allocate among themselves the waters of the Red River 

3 Basin. The Compact divides that basin into large areas 

4 called reaches and subdivides the reaches into 

subbasins. As to some of those areas, the Compact 

6 expressly allocates entitlement to water by State line. 

7 It says that the States may use the water within their 

8 boundaries exclusively. 

9  But in the section of the Compact which is 

at issue here, Reach 2, Subbasin 5, the Compact uses a 

11 very different and unique language. That section --

12 that subbasin includes the territory of all -- three of 

13 the four compacting States. The boundaries of that 

14 subbasin are drawn not by State lines, but by reference 

to the -- the last downside dam sites before tributaries 

16 to the Red River Basin -- Red River flow into the river 

17 itself. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rothfeld, we are told 

19 that in other compacts when they really mean to give one 

State the right to take another State's water, the 

21 provision in the compact is much clearer, much more 

22 definite. 

23  This clause, the one that you rely on, is 

24 kind of sketchy, isn't it? Doesn't say how they're 

going to get it, if they're going to pay for it.

1 There's a lot to be filled in. 

2  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, the provision that we 

3 are relying on, I would say is not sketchy at all. It 

4 is quite clear that all four of the compacting States 

are in the language of the Compact, have equal rights to 

6 the use of water, defined water in a defined area of the 

7 subbasin, so long as no State uses more than 25 percent 

8 of the water. That -- that is quite express as to what 

9 is required. 

In -- it's difficult to read that language 

11 to mean anything other than that the States can take --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the exact language? 

13 Do you want to read the exact language just to refresh 

14 our recollection? 

MR. CLEMENT: The exact language -- it appears 

16 -- it is reprinted on page 8 of the blue brief in the 

17 indented text, and it says, "Within this -- within this 

18 subbasin, the signatory States have equal rights to the 

19 use of," and then it defines the water that they have the 

rights to the use of, "at times of normal flow" -- with 

21 the flow of the Red River at 3,000 cubic feet per second 

22 at the Arkansas/Louisiana border -- "provided that no 

23 State is entitled to more than 25 percent of the water in 

24 excess of this amount." 

So the -- the gist of the language is States

1 have -- all -- all four signatory States have equal 

2 rights to the use of --

3  JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say that. It 

4 says, "No State is entitled to more than 25 percent." 

It doesn't say -- I mean that language doesn't say what 

6 happens if in fact there's a State that because of 

7 cliffs or something can't get the 25 percent to which it 

8 is entitled. It just doesn't say anything about it. 

9  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I have to disagree with 

that. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say something 

12 about it? 

13  MR. ROTHFELD: It says that -- the section 

14 is designed to allocate the water of the subbasin, and 

it says, "Within the subbasin, States have equal rights 

16 to use of the runoff." That's the first part of it. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

18  MR. ROTHFELD: The second part of it then 

19 says, "provided that no State is entitled to more than 

25 percent" --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Does that mean 

22 that a State can, when it can't get its pipeline to the 

23 river, go into some other State and take the water out 

24 of that other State? I mean, I would have thought, if 

that was their intent, there would be a mechanism for

1 doing it. That you'd have some authority set up by the 

2 Compact that would decide where, whether it's really 

3 true, and how are we supposed to do it, and there is no 

4 such mechanism, rather if there is such a right, which 

it doesn't say anything about, it's left to the State 

6 courts in different States to try to do what is an 

7 extremely complex and controversial administrative job. 

8  MR. ROTHFELD: A couple points to say about 

9 that. First of all, it is not at all a complex job. 

JUSTICE BREYER: It's not at all complex 

11 when Oklahoma is going to say, Texas, go run the pipe to 

12 the south of the Red River, and Texas is going to say, 

13 I'm sorry, we can't get there, there's too much cactus. 

14 And then they're going to say, don't you know that, in 

fact, when you put your pipeline into Oklahoma, you are 

16 going to be taking part of the 25 percent that belongs 

17 to us. 

18  And Texas will say, no, we aren't. And then 

19 we'll have to have a way of measuring how much goes into 

the river at different places and what are all these 

21 different pipelines are going to take out. You 

22 understand what I'm saying. 

23  MR. ROTHFELD: Right. But --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: I would have thought a 

mechanism would be set up to do that and there is none.

Official 

1  MR. ROTHFELD: Okay. Again, several things 

2 about that. First of all, in all these other compacts 

3 to which Justice Ginsburg alludes that are cited by our 

4 opponents, which expressly allow for cross-border --

virtually none of them provide any of the kinds of 

6 details that you are describing. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. But they do say 

8 expressly, and I don't know what the terrain is like in 

9 the other areas. And here it does not say anything 

about it. That's why I think we're here in the Court 

11 because all it says is you can't take more than 

12 25 percent. It doesn't say what happens when Texas is 

13 unable to get its 25 percent from the south. I'm now 

14 repeating myself, but you point to the language that 

says what I just say is not consistent with the 

16 language. 

17  MR. ROTHFELD: What I say -- I guess I will 

18 say two things about that. One, I think what you just 

19 say is, in fact, with respect, is not consistent with 

the language. I think that --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Which language is it not 

22 consistent with? 

23  MR. ROTHFELD: Equal rights to use of 

24 specified water. It -- the -- the subbasin is defined, 

again, not by State lines, it's defined by -- by 

8
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 downstream dam sites. So it has created a pool of water 


2 in the -- in this subbasin, and it says that all four 


3 States have equal rights to use of this water, provided 


4 that none takes more than 25 percent. 


It seems to me that on the face of it, that 


6 is saying State lines are not relevant and that what we 


7 are looking at is a pool of water the States can come 


8 and get it. And it is particularly so --


9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. 


MR. ROTHFELD: If I may just -- I'm sorry. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. Finish. But I --

12  MR. ROTHFELD: And I think to the extent 

13 that there could be any ambiguity in the -- in that 

14 language viewed in isolation, in the context of the rest 

of the Compact, there are places where the drafters of 

16 the Compact, in fact, did refer to State lines. They 

17 said that States are entitled to use the water within 

18 their State boundaries, in the respective States may use 

19 the water within their boundaries. They did not -- the 

framers did not use that language in this provision. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think under your 

22 argument, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, that 

23 Louisiana could decide it doesn't want to wait for the 

24 flow of water to come to it, and it could just go right 

into Oklahoma, in which it shares no border, and I don't

1 know how it's going to do that, and take its 25 percent. 

2 Does that make sense in terms of the language? 

3  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I will say two things 

4 to that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, you're talking 

6 about Texas, but Texas shares a border and so it may be 

7 a little easier to cross the borderline. But what's 

8 Louisiana going to do? 

9  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, let me make two points 

about that. 

11  First of all, I think that not only does it 

12 make sense in the language, it's compelled by the 

13 language because the language says within this subbasin 

14 all four States have equal rights. Separately, there is 

another separate reach. Reach V of the -- the Compact 

16 is Louisiana's, and so the water flows into Louisiana. 

17 When the water gets to Louisiana, it's no longer within 

18 the subbasin, it's somewhere else. 

19  So the plain language of the Compact compels 

the reading -- compels the -- the point that Louisiana 

21 could take its water from within the subbasin. 

22  Now, could it do that? The subbasin runs 

23 through to Arkansas to Louisiana, so it could go to 

24 Louisiana --

JUSTICE BREYER: Go back to the first one 

10
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official 

1 because what you have done is you've pushed me back to 

2 the equal rights. And now if I am going to fight you on 

3 it, I have to say the equal rights to water means equal 

4 rights to water arising within its boundaries. And all 

you have to say is equal rights to water arising 

6 anywhere in the subbasin. 

7  And if I just heard that, then I might say 

8 okay, I think yours is a little better. But -- but we 

9 have this enormous administrative mess that would seem 

to be created, and both those interpretations seem 

11 possible. 

12  So let's go back to that and let me hear 

13 quite clearly, now that I've focused it, what's the 

14 answer? 

MR. ROTHFELD: If I may just finish with 

16 Justice Sotomayor and I will turn to that? 

17  I think the second answer to the question 

18 is, the States are going to take the water from the 

19 closest point where they can get it. And so Louisiana 

is not going to go to Oklahoma. If it's going to go 

21 into Subbasin 5, it's going to go to Arkansas directly 

22 across the State line. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- how does it do it? 

24 Does it have to apply to Texas? 

MR. ROTHFELD: It has to apply to 

11

Official 

1 whichever --


2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: To Oklahoma. 


3  MR. ROTHFELD: If it's going to Oklahoma, 


4 and this is partially responsive to Justice Breyer, it 


would have to apply to the water authorities within 

6 Oklahoma. So what is going on here, Tarrant, the Texas 

7 water district, is applying to the Oklahoma Water 

8 Resources Board. It will seek a permit. This will 

9 operate precisely in the same way as if an Oklahoma 

applicant is seeking a permit. 

11  You will go to -- you will go and say, I 

12 want to take water out of this point. The Water 

13 Resources Board will apply its ordinary standards to 

14 determine whether or not that can be granted. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Who -- who erects the 

16 facilities to accomplish this diversion? 

17  MR. ROTHFELD: Tarrant presumably will do 

18 that. If Tarrant needs to obtain rights of way, 

19 Oklahoma law provides for exercise of eminent domain, or 

Tarrant can simply purchase the property to do that. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's -- it's my 

22 understanding that there is a place where Texas can put 

23 a line into the river, and then a subset of that 

24 question is, the main stem of the river, through --

without going through Oklahoma property, other than 

12

1 perhaps just the bank itself. 

2  MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that I think is not 

3 correct as a factual matter. The -- the Red River lies 

4 entirely within Oklahoma, and so Oklahoma, in order to 

get water out of the main stem, if -- if Texas were to 

6 do that, it would have to go into Oklahoma. And -- and 

7 in fact, this is in response to -- in part to what --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you say entirely 

9 within Oklahoma, just because of ownership of the bank? 

MR. ROTHFELD: Because --

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or because of there's also 

12 some intervening property between Texas and the bank 

13 that Oklahoma owns? 

14  MR. ROTHFELD: The -- the border between 

Oklahoma and Texas is the south vegetation line of the 

16 Red River, so therefore it is out of the river past the 

17 bank to the vegetation line. So in order to get water 

18 out of the main stem, Oklahoma and -- Texas would have 

19 to go into Oklahoma. Now, there is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do -- do the current laws 

21 prohibit that --

22  MR. ROTHFELD: Oklahoma's current laws 

23 would, I would think, prevent --

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: At any point? 

MR. ROTHFELD: At any point, because the 

13

Official 

1 laws that Tarrant is challenging here are laws that are 

2 discriminatory Oklahoma laws that prevent any use of 

3 water originating in Oklahoma outside. 

4  JUSTICE ALITO: When you say Texas has the 

right to go into Oklahoma, just -- just think about that 

6 phrase. That's -- that's very striking. I mean, it 

7 sounds like they are going to send in the National Guard 

8 or the Texas Rangers. 

9  MR. ROTHFELD: Right. And that -- if I may, 

Justice Alito, that is -- that's a very misleading way 

11 of looking at it. And I think Oklahoma's brief suggests 

12 that the Texas Rangers are going to descend on Tulsa and 

13 seize the water. That is not what -- what is 

14 contemplated. 

JUSTICE ALITO: But you were saying that 

16 Oklahoma -- that Texas has the right to force Oklahoma 

17 to take private property in Oklahoma by eminent 

18 domain if necessary. 

19  MR. ROTHFELD: No, I -- there is an -- there 

is an Oklahoma statute that says in order to -- someone 

21 who has a permit to obtain water can exercise eminent 

22 domain. An Oklahoma person can do this. A Texas person 

23 can do this. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does -- how does 

Oklahoma apply its law in this situation? I assume

1 there is normal priorities and they will get 

2 applications from a lot of people. But they have to --

3 what do they have to give Texas? Up to 25 percent? 

4  I mean, they can't just say -- deny it 

because another Oklahoma user has priority, or all this. 

6 How does that fit in with the existing administrative 

7 structure? 

8  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, Oklahoma cannot use 

9 more than 25 percent of the water within the subbasin. 

I think that our friends concede that because the 

11 language of the Compact says no State is entitled to 

12 more than 25 percent. 

13  Within each State's 25 percent allocation, a 

14 resident water user of the State will apply to the 

Oklahoma -- if they are seeking to take their water from 

16 Oklahoma, it will apply to the Oklahoma Water Resources 

17 Board, which will assess that permit precisely as it 

18 assesses permits from Oklahoma residents. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's got to give 

Texas at least up to its 25 percent, right? 

21  MR. ROTHFELD: If -- if there is a request 

22 for that much water from a Texas user, and the Texas 

23 user has priority as a permit applicant against others 

24 who are seeking to take water from this particular --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess what I'm

1 asking is, does the Compact give Texas special priority 

2 apart from what Oklahoma -- Oklahoma's priorities would 

3 be? 

4  MR. ROTHFELD: No, it does not. It's --

all -- all the Compact says is that Texas is entitled to 

6 take water from within the subbasin, its 25 percent. 

7 Now when it applies in a particular place, as Tarrant 

8 has done here, it's going to apply -- be consistent with 

9 the Oklahoma -- Water Resources Board permit application 

policies, as it has done. 

11  The resources board will assess that permit 

12 application just as it would assess an application 

13 from --

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: And what does that mean 

exactly? What would Oklahoma do to evaluate that 

16 application and to compare it to other applications from 

17 Oklahomans, and also maybe to compare it -- maybe there 

18 is more than one Texas application. 

19  How does the Oklahoma board make those 

decisions? 

21  MR. ROTHFELD: It -- a permit applicant 

22 submits an application, which has to demonstrate that it 

23 satisfies the standards for obtaining the water. That 

24 will be assessed on its merits by the Water Resources 

Board.

tell me what the Oklahoma board is going to do. I mean, 

6 why doesn't the Oklahoma board just say, you know, 

7 sorry, we like Oklahomans? Would that be all right? 

8  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that is their current 

9 policy. That would not be all right. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: What -- what -- what 

11 different kind of priorities do they have to use, and 

12 why do they have to use them, as I think -- somewhere 

13 along the lines of what the Chief Justice was asking? 

14  MR. ROTHFELD: I suppose there -- there are 

two points there. One is, if there is enough water to 

16 go around for everyone, as in fact there is, then they 

17 simply assess it in terms of priority in time. Whoever 

18 makes the first application will get it. 

19  However, Oklahoma can only get 25 -- use 

25 percent of the water. And therefore, Texas has the 

21 right, so long as there is water available and Texas has 

22 not used its 25 percent of the subbasin water. Texas 

23 has the right to seek that anywhere it can get it in the 

24 subbasin.

3  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL, 

4  FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

6  MS. O'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

7 it please the Court: 

8  The court of appeals concluded that Oklahoma 

9 may categorically foreclose Texas water users from 

accessing Reach II Subbasin 5 water in Oklahoma, and the 

11 court reached that conclusion for reasons that in the 

12 view of the United States are wrong. 

13  First, the Court of Appeals erred in 

14 applying a presumption against preemption to determine 

whether the challenged Oklahoma laws conflict with the 

16 Compact. The rationale for that presumption where it 

17 has been applied is one of federalism, but the States 

18 themselves created the terms of the interstate Compact, 

19 and respect for the States as sovereigns in that context 

requires enforcement of the Compact according to its 

21 terms. 

22  Second, the court of appeals relied on 

23 general Compact provisions to conclude that the Compact 

24 gives States unrestricted authority to regulate the 

water within their boundaries. But the general 

18
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 provisions of the Compact make clear that a State's 


2 regulation of water has to be consistent with the 


3 allocations made under the Compact, and each State's 


4 obligations under the Compact. 


JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I am not quite 

6 sure I agree with your reading of the Court of Appeals' 

7 opinion. It seems to me the Court of Appeals' opinion 

8 is consistent with the Respondents' argument that they 

9 looked at the terms of the Compact. 

And it seems to me that you may be right 

11 that the Compact either says you get the water or you 

12 don't, and the dormant Commerce Clause is just 

13 irrelevant. But I read the opinion of the court of 

14 appeals as being quite consistent with that proposition. 

You win or you lose, up or down, under the Compact. The 

16 dormant Commerce Clause doesn't -- just doesn't have 

17 much to do with it. 

18  MS. O'CONNELL: Well, we agree with that. 

19 We don't think that the dormant Commerce Clause comes 

into play here. We think that whether Texas can access 

21 the water in Oklahoma through the Oklahoma permitting 

22 process depends entirely on whether the Compact gives 

23 them that right or not. 

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's the way I 

read the analytic approach of the court of appeals at

1 39A, when it starts talking about the point of --

2 Section 5.05. 

3  MS. O'CONNELL: Right. And we don't 

4 disagree with that, that the -- that the commerce clause 

shouldn't come into play here. 

6  Where we disagree with the Court of Appeals 

7 is with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that, 

8 regardless of whether a State law would frustrate the 

9 purpose or pose an obstacle to a State obtaining its 

share of water under the Compact, that that State law 

11 should prevail under the Compact. So the Compact makes 

12 clear that those general provisions preserving State 

13 water law need to be consistent with each State's 

14 obligations under the Compact. 

And if I could --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, where, if 

17 you're relying on the Compact and its language, where do 

18 you come up with this idea that States first have to try 

19 to get their 25 percent from water within their borders? 

I don't see that anywhere. 

21  MS. O'CONNELL: Well, first of all, we think 

22 that that's an issue that, if the Court decided that --

23 that there are errors in the Court of Appeals' opinion 

24 that should be corrected, we think that's something the 

court of -- that the lower courts could consider on

1 remand. 

2  But I'll tell you where it comes from, which 

3 is Sections 2.01 and 2.10(a) of the Compact, which 

4 preserve the application of State water law. Section 

2.01 says that, "Each State may freely administer water 

6 rights and uses in accordance with the laws of that 

7 State, but that such -- such uses shall be subject to 

8 the availability of water in accordance with the 

9 Compact." 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it seems to me 

11 that you like some provisions of State law, but not 

12 others. 

13  MS. O'CONNELL: No. What we're saying is 

14 that if there's a State law that conflicts with the 

allocation or poses an obstacle to the allocation of 

16 water under the Compact, then it's preempted. 

17  But, for example, if Texas could access 

18 25 percent of the water from within its State, then 

19 the -- the application of a State law that would bar 

Texas water users from obtaining a portion of its water 

21 in Oklahoma wouldn't necessarily be preempted because it 

22 wouldn't pose an obstacle to the allocation. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do --

24 what do you do with a situation -- let's say there's 

Oklahoma water available to Tarrant that is closer than

1 the water they would get from somewhere else in Texas. 

2 Do they have to incur the additional expense to get 

3 Texas water, or can they take the cheaper route and get 

4 Oklahoma water? 

MS. O'CONNELL: Well, we think -- again, we 

6 think this is a -- an issue for the court of -- for the 

7 lower courts to look at on remand, but we think there's 

8 a -- there's a good argument to be made that, so long as 

9 Texas could access 25 percent of the water within its 

boundaries, then application of an Oklahoma law that 

11 would prohibit Texas from going through the Oklahoma 

12 permitting process wouldn't necessarily be preempted. 

13  And again, we -- these -- these -- there are 

14 lots of issues, as we point out in our brief and we did 

at the invitation stage, that would need to be 

16 addressed, perhaps, in further proceedings or perhaps 

17 before the --

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. O'Connell, isn't that a 

19 reason why we shouldn't accept your basic view? I mean, 

if -- if you think of all the issues that you laid out 

21 that are going to have to be decided and the difficulty 

22 of those issues -- I mean, you read this brief that you 

23 submitted, it gives you kind of a headache. That --

24 that -- you know, and it -- it suggests how difficult 

the process is.

1  And then you look at this provision, and 

2 maybe this provision can be read as an entitlement, but 

3 it can just as easily, as -- as Justice Breyer 

4 suggested, be read as a cap, "no more than 25 percent." 

So as between those two possible readings, 

6 the complexity of your way of reading this, which would 

7 have -- why? 

8  MS. O'CONNELL: Justice Kagan, I'd like to, 

9 if I could, go to the second point, which is on the --

the -- whether you read this as a 25 percent entitlement 

11 or a cap, and I would like to point the Court, not just 

12 to the language of the Compact, which we think weighs in 

13 favor of the idea that each right -- each State has an 

14 equal right and that the -- the equal right to use the 

water in the subbasin implies an equal right, not just 

16 an opportunity. 

17  But the interpretive comments that follow 

18 Section 5.05(b) -- this is at page 30 of the is Joint 

19 Appendix -- refer to a "right." The first full 

paragraph there says, "When the flows" -- I'm sorry, 

21 it's the -- the second line. "If the States have 

22 competing uses and the amount of water available in 

23 excess of 3,000 cubic feet per second cannot satisfy all 

24 such uses, each State will honor the other State's right 

to 25 percent of the excess flow."

1  The Red River Compact Commission also 

2 approved rules and regulations, and those say -- they're 

3 on page, I think, 19 of the Joint Appendix. I might 

4 have that page -- yeah, I have that page wrong. 

But the -- the Red River Compact 


6 Commission's rules and regulations say that when the 


7 flow is above 12,000 cubic feet per second, so that 


8 Louisiana could get its 3,000 cubic feet per second, 


9 "each of the signatory States shall be entitled to 


25 percent of the total runoff in undesignated flow." 

11  So I think it -- it's pretty clear that 

12 based on the -- both the text of the Compact and the 

13 interpretive comments in the rules that the Red River 

14 Compact Commission came up with, that there is not just 

that you can take whatever is in your borders even if 

16 that doesn't amount to 25 percent, but -- but that each 

17 State is entitled to 25 percent of the water, and that 

18 if that involves going into another State within this 

19 geographic area that's not defined with respect to State 

boundaries, then that is permissible under the Compact. 

21  And as the Petitioner pointed out, when the 

22 States wanted to impose a State boundary restriction in 

23 the Compact, they did so. There are several subbasins 

24 that span more than one geographic -- or more than one 

State, and the Compact in those provisions says that you

1 can take whatever you want within your boundaries. 

2  And I also don't think that this is going to 

3 be particularly troublesome to administer. I mean, 

4 there may need to be some further proceedings on that, 

but Oklahoma law provides the backdrop for what would 

6 happen when a Texas water user goes in to -- to ask for 

7 a permit to appropriate and divert water from within 

8 Oklahoma. 

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: And what does that mean? 

What would Oklahoma do? 

11  MS. O'CONNELL: Well, the Oklahoma Water 

12 Resources Board would just apply its normal procedures 

13 and laws to determine whether this particular use of 

14 water could be put to beneficial use. If -- they would 

just apply whatever laws they would apply to any 

16 applicant, regardless of whether they are from Texas or 

17 Oklahoma. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, people keep on saying 

19 that, and I -- I guess I just still don't understand 

quite what it means. 

21  MS. O'CONNELL: Well --

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, let's say Oklahoma, 

23 the board is sitting there and it gets lots of 

24 applications from Oklahoma users. And let's say it also 

gets multiple applications from Texas users. That it's

1 not just one county, it's four counties. What does 

2 Oklahoma do to -- to decide who gets the water? 

3  MS. O'CONNELL: Well, I think just as -- as 

4 Petitioner's counsel pointed out, there's a -- a 

priority in water law, where whoever submits the 

6 application first would -- would get the water if it's 

7 available and they can put it to beneficial use. 

8  And I -- and I -- the Court shouldn't be 

9 concerned. I know all -- I know there are amicus briefs 

submitted by other Texas entities that would like to 

11 have water from this particular subbasin as well. 

12 They're all part of the same Region C, and they -- I 

13 think they have some way to work it out. It's not --

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't understand 

your answer. If -- if you're correct, wouldn't the 

16 Oklahoma board have to give priority to the Texas 

17 applicants in order to make sure that Texas got its 

18 share of the water? 

19  It couldn't just treat -- it couldn't just 

be indifferent as to whether it was an Oklahoma or Texas 

21 applicant. 

22  MS. O'CONNELL: That -- true, to the extent 

23 that Texas was not receiving its water. I mean, 

24 under -- under our theory, which we think could be 

developed more in the lower courts, if Texas was already

1 receiving 25 percent of the water, then Oklahoma would 

2 not have to give it any kind of special priority. But 

3 if it -- if it was not, then the Oklahoma Water 

4 Resources Board would treat it just like an Oklahoma 

applicant. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: Is it correct that -- that 

7 there are reservoirs in Texas that flow into -- from 

8 which water is released into the Red River? 

9  MS. O'CONNELL: Yes. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. And --

11  MS. O'CONNELL: And in Oklahoma as well. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: And what if Texas didn't --

13 what if Texas could get -- could -- could release that 

14 water and increase the flow of the river, but it chose 

not to do so, so it could take other water out of the 

16 river? 

17  MS. O'CONNELL: This -- this is the last 

18 point made in the Respondent's brief --

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Yeah. 

MS. O'CONNELL: -- and -- and the response 

21 to that would just be that all of the States would have 

22 the opportunity to do that. In fact, the whole subbasin 

23 is defined by the last major dam site on the tributaries 

24 that are running in. So Oklahoma could do the same 

thing.

1  And also, when the reservoirs are full, 

2 they're full. It's not like Texas could keep all of the 

3 water that's -- that's there from flowing into the 

4 bottom portion of that tributary. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, we're only 

6 considering the instance where there isn't enough water 

7 to meet the 25 percent in Texas. And in that instance, 

8 I guess there are 50,000 places, not just in Oklahoma, 

9 but also in Arkansas, where they might get some. 

And all my question, and I think that was 

11 being asked, is there anything else you want to say as 

12 to why that's an easy matter to decide? 

13  MS. O'CONNELL: Well, I -- it's -- we don't 

14 think it needs to be decided in this particular 

proceeding. 

16  I think there are two errors that the Court 

17 of Appeals made in applying a presumption against 

18 preemption and in concluding that a Texas water user 

19 could never divert water from outside of its State. 

Those could be developed -- those additional problems 

21 could be dealt with by the Oklahoma Water Resources 

22 Board or as you said, perhaps in the original action.

1  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

2  MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

3 and may it please the Court: 

4  If I could just address two sort of factual 

questions. 

6  Under the -- the actual Red River Boundary 

7 Compact, the lawyer for Tarrant was wrong. There's 

8 actually a strip called Shawnee Creek, from the Denison 

9 Dam to the Shawnee Creek, that actually belongs to 

Texas. So there's a piece of the Red River in this very 

11 subbasin that is -- it's in the express Boundary 

12 Compact. 

13  Moreover, all of the Red River and Lake 

14 Texoma that is in Texas is part of the main stem, and 

that is not only in the land of Texas, Texas users draw 

16 water, quite a lot of water, from Lake Texoma. So 

17 that's two places on the main stem. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are they licensed? 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I'm sure -- you're --

you're saying that the State of Texas can take water 

21 directly from the main stem? 

22  MS. BLATT: It can and does. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's my point, yeah. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Anywhere close to of 

the 25 percent they claim entitlement to?

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was hoping you

4  (Laughter.) 

MS. BLATT: Who knows? Texas has more than 

6 a dozen fresh tributaries running from Subbasin 2 and 

7 Subbasin 4. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm talking about 

9 Subbasin 5. 

MS. BLATT: Subbasin 5, these are all --

11 excuse me -- these are tributaries that run into 

12 Subbasin 5. There is more than a dozen tributaries in 

13 Subbasin 5. 

14  For 30 years no one has ever kept track of 

any kind of accounting whatsoever, so when we say, "who 

16 knows," that is the way the drafters -- it's not only 

17 the way the drafters intended, but that has been the 

18 state of play for 30 years. 

19  So nobody -- and in the laws of Louisiana 

and Arkansas don't even track diversions. So --

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just to be clear, in your 

22 view, Texas can, without going on Oklahoma property, 

23 take water from the main stem in Basin 5? 

24  MS. BLATT: In Subbasin 5, there is only up 

from Denison Dam east to Shawnee Creek. So that's just

1 anywhere from a half a mile to three-quarters. It runs 

2 from the -- from the middle of the channel. 

3  East -- excuse me, west is Lake Texoma, and 

4 if you want to look at the map, it's a big old lake. 

That is a lot of water. And they definitely do take --

6 and that's in the brief -- they take lots of water from 

7 that lake from the Texas side. 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But my question was, can 

9 they take it from the main stem --

MS. BLATT: Only in that -- that little slip 

11 of land to Shawnee Creek. It's -- it's a part of 

12 Texas --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that the part that, 

14 under their allegation at least, is saline? 

MS. BLATT: Well, again, they drink the 

16 water in Subbasin 5. 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Is that the 

18 part that --

they're -- footnote 3 and footnote 4, their water 


6 planning documents, say this is a -- quite a -- a 


7 drinkable source of water. 


8  JUSTICE SCALIA: When they --


9  MS. BLATT: I understand they think it's 


salty, but they drink it. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: When they take water from 

12 the main stream of the Red River, how do they know how 

13 much of that water is from Reach V? 

14  MS. BLATT: Well, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They are -- they are 

16 entitled to -- to no more than 25 percent from Reach V. 

17 Is everything that -- that comes into Texas in the main 

18 channel of the Red River water from Reach V? 

19  MS. BLATT: So if you look at the -- if you 

look at the map in the red brief that's got all the --

21 the colors, and the pink is Subbasin 5. So where they 

22 divert water from is all up and down those blue 

23 tributaries that are in pink south of the Red River.

know --

6  MS. BLATT: So they -- and then if you look 

7 at that -- that blue lake that looks like a dragon, that 

8 is also where they are -- they are taking water. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: What --

MS. BLATT: That just happens to be in Reach 

11 I. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Reach I. Okay. 

13  MS. BLATT: But their water planning 

14 documents show that all the water in the pink on the 

Texas side is a very valuable source of drinking water. 

16 And if you see, all the way down to Lake Texarkana, they 

17 can -- they are taking that water, too. 

18  And when we say about what we know, no one 

19 has ever done any accounting because the Equal Rights 

Clause has always been read as equal rights to the use 

21 of the water without prejudice to or from each other's 

22 State, and, in that sense, it means that if one State 

23 took an earlier use of the water, it wouldn't gain a 

24 priority indefinitely over the other States.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it never -- it

1 never says that. I mean, that's why we have a case. It 

2 never says it has to be from your State. 

3  And I appreciate your -- the focus in your 

4 argument on State sovereignty, but this is an interstate 

Compact. And the whole point of interstate compacts is 

6 that we have to -- each State has to give up a little 

7 here or a little there to solve a problem. 

8  So I -- I guess it's -- I don't know why 

9 these basic principles of State sovereignty apply in the 

context of an interstate compact. 

11  MS. BLATT: Right. I mean, it is our 

12 position that the States would have never agreed to this 

13 extraordinary right without an -- an unequivocal 

14 explicit statement. 

But I do think it is absolutely critical to 

16 understand that what they are asking for is 

17 unprecedented, Mr. Chief Justice. There has never been 

18 a cross-border diversion, ever, under any State water 

19 compact. And the two examples they cite in their reply 

brief are inexplicable -- absolutely inexplicable. They 

21 cite the Niobrara Compact with no cite. They -- they 

22 cite the Compact, but they never say there has been a 

23 cross-border diversion. 

24  And if you look on the map --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Say that again, because

1 we have a green brief that gives us samples of 

2 provisions for cross border. 

3  MS. BLATT: Yeah, under explicit right. 

4 There has never been a cross-border diversion without an 

explicit statement. Not only --

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because there have been 

7 many, many --

8  MS. BLATT: Many with explicit statements 

9 and then the essential bells and whistles as to eminent 

domain, points of diversion, and which choice of law. 

11  And what they tried to say because we have 

12 been saying all along how unprecedented this would be to 

13 sort of read in silence on borders, they tried to come 

14 up with two examples in their reply brief. 

And that's what I'm talking about. The 

16 reply brief is not only -- is devoid of a citation, but 

17 Nebraska and Wyoming told both us, and Wyoming told 

18 Tarrant's counsel, that there have never been 

19 diversions. And Nebraska was quite -- like, wow, we 

hadn't known that. And it shows the danger of their 

21 position. They think if it's silent as to borders, the 

22 State of Wyoming can go hundreds of miles into Nebraska 

23 and take the water across the border. 

24  The other example they cite is fascinating 

because it's a lawsuit before you. They cite the Rio

3 the notion that Texas can't go into New Mexico. It's 

4 New Mexico has a downstream delivery. So --

JUSTICE BREYER: But there was a point, it 

6 seems to me, to favor them, which is go back to 1970 --

7 the '70s, when they drafted this. 

8  MS. BLATT: I'm there. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: So they are in the room, 

and there are representatives of all four States, and as 

11 they say, okay, there is going to be more than 3,000 feet, 

12 what happens? And Louisiana would say, we want at least 

13 25 percent, done. Arkansas, 25 percent, done. 

14 Oklahoma, same, done. Texas, same, done. 

But everybody in the room knows that Texas 

16 could never get more than 12 percent within its borders. 

17 And since it could never get 12 -- more than 12 percent, 

18 Louisiana would be sitting there with not really 

19 25 percent but with 38. And so -- so -- - - - - --

MS. BLATT: But with all due -- sorry. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: -- that would suggest that, 

22 hey, no, they all knew this and so they meant there must 

23 be some way for Texas to get the extra. Otherwise, why

MS. BLATT: There's no -- because there's no 

16 evidence there was any discussion about any State and 

17 whether -- Texas never complained. No one ever said 

18 Texas couldn't get its water.

easy thing to check going back to 1970 --

1  MS. BLATT: We did. They did in their 


2 brief, and they came up with an 11 to 16 percent. Our 


3 engineers ran the numbers after correcting their 


4 three-series method -- methodological errors, and we 


came up with 29 percent. 

6  They -- they double-counted streams. They 

7 forgot that Subbasin 5 is not only runoff but also rain. 

8 And then -- this one's humorous -- they didn't count the 

9 excess. So all the -- all the math that they did 

favored Texas, so the math didn't come out that way. 

11  But what's interesting about the Tarrant's 

12 view in juxtaposing with the United States' view, 

13 Tarrant's view is it could have all the water, but they 

14 could get all of it still from Oklahoma. So Louisiana, 

Arkansas, and -- and Texas could come take all their 

16 share from Oklahoma, forcing Oklahoma to have to go 

17 south. 

18  Now the United States' view, and this is 

19 I -- they read a border limitation in there. They say, 

look, borders are here, but if Texas really needs it,

4 we've never claimed this. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do you think is 

6 the remedy? Meaning --

7  MS. BLATT: The remedy? 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- let me just posit 

9 the point, okay? I understand your point to the Chief 

that there's been no proof that Texas doesn't get its 

11 25 percent or that it couldn't get it from the main stem 

12 or somewhere. I accept that. 

13  But let's, for the hypothetical, say that 

14 there's a major drought and Texas can't get it from its 

portion. What's its remedy? 

16  MS. BLATT: Okay. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18 getting --

19  MS. BLATT: Okay. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21  MS. BLATT: Yeah. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24  MS. BLATT: Okay. 

Here -- Yeah. 

So that -- that it's not 

-- 25 percent --

So let's --

-- as the Compact 

It's the last statement. 

The Compact no way, no how entitles the parties to equal

1 25 percent. It just doesn't say equal rights to a 


2 numerical share. It doesn't say equal rights to a 


3 numerical quantity. 


4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It says, "shall have 


equal rights to the use of runoff originating in 

6 Subbasin 5." 

7  MS. BLATT: Right. And you and I could have 

8 equal rights to the use of the family car or equal 

9 rights to the use of the highway. That doesn't tell me 

anything about how many hours I can spend on the 

11 highway. 

12  But here's the problem. The real problem is 

13 with the cap. Okay? Their view is that the first 

14 clause gives you an absolute equal right to a fixed 

25 percent, no exceptions. But then you have this 

16 provided clause which does no work for them. The 

17 provided clause, which says you don't get any more than 

18 25 percent, they are saying, well, by definition, if you 

19 get exactly 25 percent, the State can take no more than 

25 percent. So they actually just sort of combine the 

21 two. 

22  The other -- I hate to point this out 

23 because I -- I feel a lot of affinity for the United 

24 States, but their proof --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are representing 

MS. BLATT: I am, but I used to work for 

They say well, we're guaranteed an equal 

11 25 percent share, and they cite the compliance rules on 

12 page 19. And entertainingly so, the rules that they 

13 cite just disprove what they said. 

14  The first rule they cite only gave 3 States. 

They divided it by 3 instead of 4. Their view, the 

16 United States' view, is there's a guarantee of 

17 25 percent of any amount that's in excess of 3,000. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, this is a -- a 

19 perfectly legitimate argument for you to make, but I 

want to go back to Justice Sotomayor's question. 

21  At least as I understood it, it's this, I 

22 want you to assume -- I know you don't agree with 

23 that -- I want you to assume that the Compact gives 

24 Texas a right to 25 percent of the -- of the excess --

of the water above the cubic foot.

1  MS. BLATT: The excess, yeah. 

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I want you to assume that. 

3 Now, wouldn't the Compact be meaningless if Texas 

4 couldn't actually reach that water? 

MS. BLATT: That is -- that is the United 

6 States' view, and they'd have to go above it. What they 

7 would have to do, which no one else -- no one has 

8 done -- and I think the drafters thought it was 

9 ultimately impossible because of Arkansas and Louisiana, 

is call for an accounting and actually figure out what 

11 the total was, figure out what the excess was, divvy up 

12 the 4 shares, do exactly what Tarrant wants I guess to 

13 happen, which has never happened, and it's not clear to 

14 the drafters of the compliance rules that it could in 

fact ever happen because of the riparian laws of 

16 Arkansas and Louisiana. 

17  But -- so in other words, if we lost this 

18 case, which is probably why Tarrant is disavowing the 

19 United States' view, is Texas would be in quite of a 

pickle trying to prove they couldn't get their 

21 25 percent. And so I read Tarrant as saying, don't you 

22 dare send us back to try to prove that. We want to be 

23 able to go whole hog into Oklahoma. 

24  And if I could get to the point that Justice 

Kagan was talking about, what's on the ground happening,

1 and why Oklahoma would have never agreed to this type of 

2 cross-border right because what Tarrant is doing is 

3 exploiting Oklahoma's law, which proceeds on the 

4 assumption that water in Oklahoma is a public trust 

that's held for the exclusive benefits of Oklahoma. 

6  And there are three ways where Oklahoma 

7 would not have agreed to this, and it would have been 

8 carefully articulated in a Compact. 

9  The first is prior appropriation. There are 

4 Texas entities that have signed up for permits: The 

11 Upper Trinity, the North Texas Municipal Water District, 

12 Irving and Tarrant. And poor Oklahoma City got 

13 sandwiched in the middle. It beat -- it beat Trinity to 

14 the permit office by 24 hours. 

And so not surprisingly, it's open season 

16 for Oklahoma water, all of north Texas has come in and 

17 sought a permit and there's priority. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's the same 

19 problem. Even if you take within State, all of these 

people, if they were applying for water in Texas as 

21 well, there'd be the same issue there. One of them 

22 would beat the other one. It's a question of priority. 

23 You're just claiming that everybody from Oklahoma should 

24 have -- well, not absolute priority, but --

MS. BLATT: Well, I have two points. First, 

43
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 had -- had Oklahoma seen this coming, since they hadn't 

2 heard about this until Tarrant filed its application, 

3 Oklahoma City certainly would have gotten in line 

4 faster. And second of all, the whole point of this 

Compact -- and if you think about your equitable 

6 apportionment doctrines, which whoever gets to the water 

7 first gets a prior -- gets a priority permanently --

8 this was the point of the Compact. Louisiana and 

9 Arkansas wouldn't have to develop their water, Texas and 

Oklahoma were much more economically developed States, 

11 and the equal rights prevented a race to the permit 

12 office. 

13  Let me get to the second aspect what's a 

14 problem, and that is, compacts usually spell out the 

points of diversion. The last place Oklahoma would have 

16 picked as the point of diversion is the Kiamichi River, 

17 and Tarrant is saying, not surprisingly, it's the most 

18 desirable. 

19  And the third is the eminent domain. 

Eminent domain law in Oklahoma proceeds on the 

21 assumption that those are Oklahomans who got the permit, 

22 and thus can exercise a core sovereign power, and 

23 Tarrant, not surprisingly, would like to come in and do 

24 that.

 And none of this is happening with the

2 vote out of office the Tarrant officials. It cannot 

3 vote out of office the Upper Trinity or the North Texas 

4 Municipal Water District. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Blatt, does Oklahoma 

6 law in any circumstance permit an appropriation of 

7 water -- water in Oklahoma for out-of-State use? 

8  MS. BLATT: Well, it's -- if it's compacted 

9 water, you have to get legislative approval and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Just here and now, does 

11 Oklahoma ever --

12  MS. BLATT: Yes, it can. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- permit out-of-State 

14 use of its water? 

MS. BLATT: It has not. It could, but 

16 the -- but Tarrant is correct that there are facial 

17 differences with respect to out-of-State. So 

18 out-of-State users would have to get the water going 

19 faster, it's subject to a review. And there's a 

statement in there that you need to look and see if 

21 there's a better use for Oklahoma. 

22  Now, I hope you ask them this because I 

23 gather their view is under the dormant Commerce Clause 

24 is all of those laws are constitutional with respect to 

99 percent of the Compact, which is it's allocated to --

45

1 to Oklahoma for its free and unrestricted use. So 

2 they're basically saying there's 1 percent of this 

3 Compact that's unconstitutional. 

4  And not only is it 1 percent, the minute it 

drops below 3,000, all of a sudden, it became. And on 

6 this, we'd like to talk to the Russello principle. I 

7 also hope you ask them, this is on page 15A of -- 14A of 

8 the 15A brief. There are border references arbitrarily 

9 and they're missing, they're there. It's completely 

inconsistent. 

11  And this -- their view would make complete 

12 mincemeat out of 4 other provisions of the Compact. And 

13 ironically, it would march a lot of States into Texas. 

14 But back to (b) -- (b)(2) and 5.05(c) operate identical 

in that they're basically downstream delivery, where all 

16 States have to release 40 percent of the water 

17 downstream. So they -- they're the same. They're 

18 absolutely identical. 

19  You hold on to 60, you let 40 percent go. 

But only (c) contains that border reference. Only (c) 

21 says, "within their respective States." And yet even in 

22 (c), it's completely redundant and unnecessary because 

23 you can't release water from without your State.

2 sorry -- of the red brief. So only (c) says within 


3 their respective States, but (b)(2) is the exact same 


4 functioning provision, and it's missing the border 


reference. And I -- you don't have time now to ask the 

6 United States' view, but I think the United States would 

7 agree with us that if you give this border thing kind of 

8 the magical meaning, borders kind of appear and 

9 disappear with the water flow, which is very strange. 

Tarrant thinks that there's some heretofore 

11 unheard of crediting system, but they don't have an 

12 explanation on how (b)(2) and (c) -- but more 

13 importantly, if you could just turn to 9A for just a 

14 minute, which is 402, I want to walk you through this --

I'm sorry, 401(b). This is a provision that -- this is 

16 water wholly within Texas. And you don't have to 

17 understand much to know that Texas keeps 60, Oklahoma 

18 gets 40. 

19  So you have a big chunk of Texas, and Texas 

is allocated 60 and Oklahoma is allocated 40. Now, 

21 under Tarrant's view, because this is silent as to 

22 borders and because Oklahoma is not in this Reach, it's 

23 not actually located within the subbasin, Oklahoma 

24 either is entitled to or has to go get all of its water 

from Texas. And this pattern repeats itself -- this is

1 on page 41 of our brief -- throughout the Compact, where

4 entertaining. 

I can't tell if they think Louisiana can go 

6 into Oklahoma or has to move one inch up to the border 

7 to take it out as opposed to just waiting, but under 

8 this view -- and again, it repeats itself throughout the 

9 contract -- the State that's not in the basin because 

there are no borders and because, I guess under their 

11 view, the only way that Oklahoma to get its water would 

12 be to go into Texas, and that's why they're sort of 

13 taking this bit about, oh, this Russello principle, if 

14 it's here, it must mean -- it must have had 

significance, would make a complete mess of the Compact. 

16  If I could also just turn to the remand of 

17 the United States. I just wanted to make -- to make 

18 three points. And that is, I do think it is significant 

19 that it's pointed -- it is addressed to a problem that 

Texas itself has never asserted. They're saying well, 

21 poor Texas can't get its water. And remember, Texas is 

22 upstream, so this sort of poor Texas is only to Texas. 

23 No other State is going to have this problem because the 

24 rest are downstream.

subconsciously or unconsciously or unintentionally

7  JUSTICE BREYER: In Subbasin 1, that's

4 all work? 

MS. BLATT: Justice Breyer, you have to 


6 trust me. There has never been an accounting ever, 


7 ever, ever, ever under this Compact. 


8  JUSTICE BREYER: So, so -- - in other 


9 words --


MS. BLATT: No measurements have ever been 

11 taken with respect to this. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. So that -- I don't 

13 know how that cuts because certainly the people who drew 

14 this must have thought at least in those other 

provisions they are going to develop a measurement 

16 system in case of controversy. 

17  MS. BLATT: Well, there are gauges. So 

18 they -- I mean, it would not be impossible, although 

19 very expensive. And just so you know, Section 211, and 

in the interpretive comments of 211, the State said the 

21 last thing we want is this accounting because it's 

22 expensive and burdensome. And Louisiana and Arkansas, 

23 if you look at the minutes, they are complaining because 

24 their laws are not set up for accounting. They are 

riparian States, so they don't track diversions. They

what you just said, "They're riparian States, so they 

6 don't track diversions." 

7  MS. BLATT: Okay. So when you comment --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does that follow? 

9  MS. BLATT: Right. Okay. So in the -- the 

Oklahoma and Texas, in their permitting system, what 

11 they permit, they track how much you take under the 

12 permit. They measure. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

14  MS. BLATT: Louisiana, if you are a 

landowner, you just draw from the water and it's a --

16 it's a voluntary reporting system, so you don't 

17 necessarily have to tell the State how much you took 

18 out. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

MS. BLATT: So one is a permitting system, 

21 and in Louisiana and Arkansas -- and, I think, again, 

22 the minutes just talk about we hope Louisiana and 

23 Arkansas will develop their laws to do better tracking 

24 of diversions. But again, this would be the problem of 

an accounting.

4  JUSTICE BREYER: The relevant legal 

argument, I think, is look at what you just cited to us 

6 about this Reach in the subbasin. 60 percent goes to 

7 Texas, 40 percent to Oklahoma. 

8  MS. BLATT: Right. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, they've never 

measured it. That's because they never fought about it, 

11 I guess. And now we have a fight. So why is it any 

12 easier to develop the necessary measuring system 

13 there --

14  MS. BLATT: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- than it would be here? 

16  MS. BLATT: -- the disaster --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: And that argues against you 

18 because your main point, really, is that this is all too 

19 complicated --

MS. BLATT: Justice Breyer, the disaster 

21 would be and the affront to sovereignty is throughout 

22 the Compact, not so much the measuring that's a problem. 

23 Oklahoma would be able to insist on crossing Texas's 

24 borders to draw that 40 percent. And no one has ever, 

ever envisioned any of the Compact as not applying 

52

1 borders. It's not so much the measurement. 

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought that 

3 was what your -- the other side does envision, that it 

4 doesn't -- it's not bound by the borders, but it's bound 

by the agreement, the Compact. Compacts compromise the 

6 individual State sovereignty. That's the whole point of 

7 them. 

8  MS. BLATT: Okay. But if their view -- I 

9 mean, it is that they have to -- again, our view is that 

if they had wanted, like all the other cross-border 

11 rights, to allow for an extraordinary right, they would 

12 have made an explicit statement and then spelled out 

13 exactly what that meant, most importantly the point of 

14 diversion. Here, at most you have silence on the issue. 

Now, the government reads into borders 

16 sometimes because they say you do have borders unless 

17 there is a need. Under Tarrant's view, which I think is 

18 the most jarring and remarkable view, this is all a 

19 borderless common, and every State could have 

criss-crossing pipelines into every State because you 

21 don't have an exhaustion requirement. So Texas, even 

22 though it's got plenty of water in its fresh water 

23 streams and currently uses them, could take their whole 

24 25 percent from Oklahoma. Oklahoma could take its whole 

25 percent from Texas. Arkansas could come into

2  And I think the United States thought, no, 


3 that doesn't make too much sense. Let's at least make 


4 Texas exhaust. 


But the provision -- the Compact doesn't say 

6 this. Again, the United States and Tarrant proceed on 

7 the assumption that there is a numerical share, that 

8 it's equal rights to an exact 25 percent, exact 

9 25 percent. Well, that's not what it says. It just 

says equal rights to the use subject to a cap, and we 

11 think a cap by limiting the use is not a guarantee that 

12 you can reach the cap, much less that you can cross 

13 borders to reach the cap. 

14  And if I could just make one more sense --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Blatt, the solicitor 

16 general here today spoke of lots of different examples 

17 where the language of entitlement and rights was used. 

18 Do you have a view as -- as to that? 

19  MS. BLATT: So they -- you mean the two 

compliance rules they cited? They cited -- so they 

21 say -- that's what I was saying that was sort of sad is 

22 because what they cited disproved what they were trying 

23 to assert it for. 

24  So if you -- you don't even have to read 

the -- you don't even have to read the compliance rules.

1 Just read page 19 of their brief. They say in the same 

2 sentence that we have an equal -- there's an equal right 

3 to one-fourth of an excess above 3,000. So that means 

4 you take whatever is above 3,000 and divide by four 

equally. And then they cite a provision that only 

6 divides by 3. And then the next provision they cite 

7 didn't divide the excess, it divided the total water. 

8  I don't know why they -- it's inexplicable. 

9 I can't tell you why they did that. 

And the only other thing I want to say on 

11 the extrinsic evidence, and I do think -- if you think 

12 there's any ambiguity in here, which I think there 

13 clearly is, you have 30 years of post ratification, 

14 which the States immediately did long-term water 

planning without so mentioning of this right. And 

16 Tarrant actually offered to buy the same water for 

17 $1.7 billion in 2002, which is a little bit inconsistent 

18 with the notion that they had this right all along. 

19 They just, in 18 months of negotiating history, never 

mentioned that they thought they owned the water, they 

21 were actually offering to pay 1.7 million. And the 

22 amicus brief filed by the Tribes, on page 4, says we 

23 were at the negotiating table and we never heard Tarrant 

24 mention this right.

 And the other thing, I do think the water

1 planning documents are highly significant because not so 


2 much Louisiana and Arkansas, but Oklahoma and Texas take

4 appropriation systems. There are hundreds of thousands 


of pages on the Internet and none of them mention this 


6 right. Again, they cited something in their reply 


7 brief, but if you go look at it, it doesn't come close 


8 to mentioning a right of Subbasin 5. Again, ironically

have to actually buy the water.

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how do you deal with 

8 all the provisions she was mentioning with respect to 

9 the 60/40 division? I can't make rhyme or reason of 

those provisions that don't use within State boundaries, 

11 but it has to mean that. 

12  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I don't think that it 

13 has to mean that. If Oklahoma wants to enter Texas to 

14 take -- if it makes more sense for them to do it, they 

can. If not, they can just wait for the water to flow 

16 down. 

17  I think one thing which -- which Ms. Blatt 

18 did not address is the practicalities of how Subbasin 5 

19 operates. If you look at the map that was pointed out 

to you, Subbasin 5, which is what we're talking about 

21 here, is a very wide -- hundreds of miles wide, but 

22 extremely narrow. It's 10 to 20 miles wide -- north to 

23 south for most of its length. 

24  The reason the drafters drew this is because 

the States all take -- the assumption was all of the 

57

1 water in this Subbasin was going to be surplus water, 


2 literally excess water. The States all take the water 


3 that they want to use outside of Subbasin 5, and so 


4 the -- the allocations that Ms. Blatt was referring to 


by Oklahoma are all in Subbasin 1, they are not in 

6 Subbasin 5. The water that flows into Subbasin 5 is 

7 water that the States assumed was going to be surplus. 

8 And so it would make no sense, having divided this water 

9 evenly between the compacting States, to think that the 

drafters would have required a water user in Texas at 

11 the far west end, which would get its portion of the 

12 25 percent share two miles across the border in 

13 Oklahoma, instead to have to go 200 miles to the east to 

14 get it out of Texas. 

That is not what the drafters intended to 

16 accomplish by this. They created, by the plain terms of 

17 the -- of the language, a common pool of water defined 

18 by dam site, not by State line, and gave each State 

19 equal rights to access that water so long as they did 

not use more than 25 percent. 

21  Your response to a question which was raised 

22 by Justice Kagan both to me and Ms. Blatt, I think the 

23 practical application of this is very simple. One 

24 simply has to apply to the permitting authorities, 

wherever you're submitting your application from, they

1 will apply their ordinary standards. The Oklahoma Water 

2 Resources Board does that now for applications from 

3 within Oklahoma, it can do it just as well for 

4 applications from Texas or other from other States. 

And, again, the practicality of this is, 

6 water users are going to want to use water as close to 

7 where they are located as they can. They're going to go 

8 right across the State line within Subbasin 5 if that's 

9 the place to get the water. It makes no sense to 

require them to go hundreds of miles distant to get it. 

11  Ms. Blatt suggested that we are reading the 

12 25 percent limitation out of the Compact. I think her 

13 reading reads the equal rights language out of the 

14 Compact. They read the Subbasin 5 language as being all 

capped and no entitlement. It does two things. It 

16 gives equal rights to the water, and then says that you 

17 can't take more than 25 percent within your State. So 

18 it's designed to do two things. It's designed to give 

19 you an entitlement and to say you can only use 

25 percent of it. 

21  And finally, Ms. Blatt raised questions of 

22 -- of sovereignty and political concern. As the Chief 

23 Justice suggested, this is a Compact that's an agreement 

24 between coordinate sovereigns. They have decided what 

they want to do. And the thing that gives respect to

1 sovereignty is to write -- is to read the plain language 

2 of the Compact as the framers wrote it. Again, they spent 

3 25 years writing it. They took considerable care, as 

4 you can tell if you look at the negotiating history, in 

using the words for each provision. Those words should 

6 be given meaning. 

7  If there are no further questions. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

11 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
