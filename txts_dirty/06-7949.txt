 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in Case 06-7949, Gall v. United States.

 Mr. Green.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. GREEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 When Judge Robert W. Pratt of the Southern 

District of Iowa sentenced Brian Michael Gall on May 27, 

2005, he found Mr. Gall to be an individual who had 

fully rehabilitated himself by having voluntarily 

withdrawn from a conspiracy five years earlier, by 

remaining crime-free throughout that period, by having 

rid himself of his addictions, by having graduated from 

college, by having learned a trade, by having built a 

successful and thriving business.

 Judge Pratt carefully weighed the Section 

3553(a) factors and in a ten-page sentencing memorandum 

set forth cogent reasons why a sentence of probation 

would better fit the purposes and factors specified in 

Section 3553(a) than a sentence of incarceration.

 The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed 

that judgment on the basis of the extraordinary

circumstances test that we would ask the Court to 

overturn today.

 The Eighth Circuit substituted its judgment 

for that of Judge Pratt, saying that Judge Pratt had 

placed too much weight on Mr. Gall's voluntary 

withdrawal from the conspiracy and in so doing had not 

satisfied or overcome the extraordinariness barrier.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If it had been the other 

way around and the district court had said what 

appellate court said and the appellate court had said 

what the district court said, what would you be arguing?

 MR. GREEN: Certainly, Justice Kennedy, I 

would probably be arguing something of the reverse.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. GREEN: It is -- it is an abuse of 

discretion --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you can see the 

systemic concern. I mean, it's just not always going to 

be the case that the district judge is the one to give 

more leniency.

 MR. GREEN: Yes, that's certainly true, but 

in this instance an abuse of discretion standard 

applies.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I thought it was your 

argument that if any rational judge could impose the

sentence that's imposed, then that sentence has to be 

sustained. So you're saying that either the district 

court or the Eighth Circuit here was irrational?

 MR. GREEN: No. I wouldn't say -- well, let 

me -- the district court was certainly not irrational in 

our view.

 JUSTICE ALITO: No. But in answer to 

Justice Kennedy's question, you hesitated in saying 

that, if the district court had taken the approach of 

the court of appeals, that would also have to be 

sustained. But under your analysis wouldn't it have to 

be unless you're going to argue --

MR. GREEN: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- that that approach is 

irrational?

 MR. GREEN: It would have to be. I 

hesitated because there -- there might be instances in 

which, as indeed the government admits in its brief, 

that the reasons and the facts and circumstances don't 

logically cohere with the sentence that's given.

 In other words, if all of the circumstances 

and facts point a certain way -- in this instance, for 

example, they point to a downward departure -- and 

suddenly the judge goes up to the statutory max, that 

might be an instance in which a court of appeals could

say no reasonable judge would have imposed that 

sentence. There doesn't seem to be a reason for doing 

so.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the Eighth 

Circuit, laying aside the extraordinary circumstances 

test, saying the judge, the sentencing judge gave credit 

for his leaving the conspiracy, but he didn't blow the 

whistle, so the conspiracy continued. He could have 

stopped the conspiracy.

 And, similarly, yes, he rehabilitated 

himself, but he earned some 30 to $40,000 in the drug 

business, and that aided his rehabilitation, and maybe 

there's some kind of obligation to pay back.

 So could a court of appeals try to instruct 

district judges and say: Now, in this factor, leaving a 

conspiracy, we want district judges to be aware of the 

difference between one who leaves and blows the whistle 

and one who lets it continue; and, similarly, one who 

uses the ill-gotten gains to set himself up in business.

 MR. GREEN: Justice Ginsburg, when someone 

leaves the conspiracy and blows the whistle, typically, 

that individual is not charged. The Department of 

Justice, for example, in its Antitrust Division says 

that if a corporation or individual comes to it and 

blows the whistle on, say, a price-fixing conspiracy,

that individual is never charged to begin with.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sure 

that's not always true. I mean, if the leader of some 

vast conspiracy is the one who blows the whistle, I 

suspect he may well be charged anyway.

 MR. GREEN: That's true, Your Honor. There 

are instances in which --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Lex Luthor might.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. GREEN: Yes, but the point is that 

blowing the whistle is -- is not only a voluntary 

withdrawal, but also something so far beyond the bounds 

of what prosecutors typically see that that individual, 

typically or generally is the individual that receives 

immunity or amnesty in the case.

 To respond to the second part of your 

question, with respect to the amount of money that 

Mr. Gall made, he did not use it, and there's no 

information in the record that indicates that he built 

his business on the basis of the use of that money.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is no indication 

that he gave it back, or there was no fine attached to 

it.

 MR. GREEN: No, there was not, and in part 

because, as the sealed volume of the appendix

demonstrates, Mr. Gall did not at that point have money 

to pay a fine.

 Remember that he was -- he left the 

conspiracy in September of 2000. He was not approached 

by agents until late 2003. He was not charged until 

2004 and was not sentenced until 2005.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you don't -- you 

don't have to answer all of these things for your case, 

do you?

 MR. GREEN: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're not saying that a 

reasonable person couldn't have found the opposite. 

You're just saying that a reasonable person could have 

found what this district judge found.

 MR. GREEN: That's exactly right, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So why don't you just 

swallow all these things and say, yeah, I suppose the 

court of appeals could say that, but --

MR. GREEN: I -- I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- but my point stands?

 MR. GREEN: Yeah, well, I'm happy to swallow 

in that sense.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. GREEN: There's no doubt about the fact

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, what's 

left of the appellate review? I mean, under your theory 

is there any substantive review for the appellate court 

or is it all just procedural under -- putting aside your 

logical coherence point, which --

MR. GREEN: There is -- there isn't much 

left besides the fact that it is abuse of discretion 

review. That there is no robust substantive component 

to -- to reasonableness review of sentences, is really a 

complaint about abuse of discretion review.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And that's the problem.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In a typical abuse 

of discretion review, you still have -- for example, if 

you have a judge in -- well, let's say you have a judge; 

in one case he says because this is a -- a young 

defendant, I'm going to give him a lighter sentence; and 

in the next case says, you know, I don't think age is a 

factor that I should consider in the case; in the next 

case he says it is and then not. Each -- all of those 

cases, I take it, are upheld under your view on 

appellate review.

 MR. GREEN: Not necessarily. I think if --

if a judge --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there can be

substantive review for consideration of age?

 MR. GREEN: Not necessarily for 

consideration of age, but a court of appeals could say 

to -- to such a judge -- and I am sure that one of the 

parties would point this out, would say you considered 

it last time; you didn't consider it. You've been 

seesawing back and forth on this. The court of appeals 

could say --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, so at the same 

time --

MR. GREEN: -- explain why --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if you have two 

district judges in the same courthouse and the one says, 

when I have a young defendant I always -- I forget 

whether the term is "vary" or "depart" -- but I always 

go down, and the next judge says, I never consider age. 

Those -- both of those are upheld under your view, I 

take it?

 MR. GREEN: Yes, both -- both would be 

upheld.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Now, why --

MR GREEN: If somebody said --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why wouldn't the judge in, 

as it were, the second case give some consideration, be 

required under abuse review to give some consideration,

to what is sort of the norm in that circuit so that he 

doesn't stand out as either a "let-them-loose" judge or 

a hanging judge?  Doesn't abuse of discretion at least 

require a broader view than simply the -- literally the 

case before the court?

 MR. GREEN: Well, it does require a broader 

view, and certainly a judge could --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And wouldn't there be at 

least under the Chief Justices's hypothetical, wouldn't 

there be a possibility of looking to those other cases 

rather than just automatically affirming on -- on abuse 

review?

 MR. GREEN: There would be.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. GREEN: And I was about to add --

JUSTICE ALITO: Would the judge have to 

consider the cases from the judge's district or from the 

circuit or from the whole country?

 MR. GREEN: I would -- I would imagine a 

judge would want to look at -- at cases from the whole 

country.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that exactly 

MR. GREEN: Certainly they have --

what the Sentencing Commission did in establishing the 

Guidelines?

 MR. GREEN: It did in establishing the 

Guidelines. There are disputes about whether the 

commissioners actually modified the guidelines on the 

basis of what judges have actually done.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It looked at them. It 

didn't necessarily follow them.

 MR. GREEN: Exactly.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: With white collar crime, 

for example, it went vastly higher than what had been 

the practice.

 MR. GREEN: That's -- that's exactly right, 

Justice Scalia. So there is a component to this in 

which a judge might want to look through legal database, 

for example, or even a blog or something like that, and 

look and see --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Going back to the Chief 

Justice's hypothetical and the colloquy you had with him 

with the hypothetical, the two different judges in the 

statement district or the same circuit that treat age 

differently, if the Congress saw that would the Congress 

be able to say anything about that, do anything about 

that to stop the disparity?

 MR. GREEN: Certainly.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Consistently with the 

Sixth Amendment?

 MR. GREEN: Certainly. And one of our 

responses, Justice Kennedy, to the issue of there not 

being a robust component of substantiveness -- or --

excuse me -- of substantive review of sentences if that 

Congress can fix that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How?

 MR. GREEN: If the unwarranted --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How can it fix the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: One question. Why 

couldn't, if there is some kind of substantive standard 

of reasonableness, why couldn't a court of appeals in a 

particular circuit say that -- if one judge relies on 

age, 19, and the other judges do not, why couldn't the 

court of appeals say that one of those two positions is 

unreasonable?

 MR. GREEN: A court of appeals could, yes, I 

think it could that. They could ask an explanation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: There could be a common --

sort of a common law of reasonableness developed through 

the public process?

 MR. GREEN: I think that's correct. A 

common law --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And another circuit would

develop the opposite. I mean, this circuit would say 

that 17 is unreasonable. The other circuit would say 

that 19 is unreasonable. And we would have to sort out 

all those things ultimately, right?

 MR. GREEN: That's -- that's correct Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: In kind of a sentencing 

review court?

 MR. GREEN: Yes. Yes, and that is -- that 

is one danger of the extraordinary circumstances test. 

In fact, there's two dangers in that --

JUSTICE ALITO: Could Congress pass a 

statute that says age is not relevant in sentencing 

except in extraordinary circumstances? Would that be a 

violation of the Sixth Amendment?

 MR. GREEN: I believe that Congress could 

pass such a statute, yes. But -- but -- I hesitate to 

add that, to the extent that there is a constitutional 

grounding for individualized sentencing and age is a key 

factor with respect to individualized sentencing, I -- I 

want to hesitate and I want to waver. I'm not sure --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you said -- you said 

before that, and very definitely, that Congress could 

fix the case of where one judge said, I'm always lenient 

on 17-year-olds and the other said, I throw the book at

him. You said yes, Congress could fix that. Well, how 

other than in the way that Justice Alito just proposed?

 MR. GREEN: Well, in response to that 

question and your earlier question, Justice Ginsburg, 

certainly Congress could, to fix the entire problem 

here, could adopt the solution that we proposed in 

Booker and in Fanfan that to say that -- that in order 

to enhance a sentence at all, that has -- it has to be a 

fact found by the jury, what's so-called Blakelyizing of 

the Guidelines. That's one way to do it.

 Congress could also, as has been suggested 

and I believe legislation has been introduced on this, 

they could make the Guidelines essentially topless, so 

that there -- so that there was complete --

JUSTICE ALITO: If Congress can pass a 

statute without violating the Sixth Amendment saying age 

is ordinarily not relevant, then could Congress delegate 

to an expert agency the authority to make that decision 

without violating the Sixth Amendment?

 MR. GREEN: No, I don't think that it could. 

Any time Congress --

JUSTICE ALITO: Based on what? Why could it 

-- why can't it delegate the authority if it can do it 

itself?

 MR. GREEN: Well, it could delegate the

authority. There's no doubt about it. And this Court 

has said it's all right for Congress to delegate the 

authority to the commission. But the problem, Justice 

Alito, comes whenever we limit the statutory continuum 

from zero to the statutory maximum sentence, if we 

overlay a consideration. If on the extraordinary 

circumstances test we make the Guidelines the benchmark 

and we tether or we measure from the Guidelines, we have 

then set a kind of statutory range.

 If Congress says to a commission, we want 

you to develop a kind of mini-guideline based upon age, 

we think that there might be departure in some 

circumstances but not other circumstances, that might be 

an instance where we are setting a kind of ceiling and a 

floor and a range within the otherwise broader statutory 

continuum. That's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Green, I 

understood you to respond to Justice Souter's question 

that courts of appeals could consider a broader range of 

cases in deciding whether it's an abuse of discretion in 

a particular case.

 MR. GREEN: Certainly.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, if they can 

consider a broader range of cases, what's so bad about 

suggesting that if a particular case is way out of what

their broad review shows, if the broad review shows that 

in most cases this type of defendant gets 5 years and in 

this particular case, the judge gave him 30 years or 

gave him zero, what's wrong with suggesting that that is 

a factor they should at least start with in saying 

something's unusual about this case, we ought to take 

closer look?

 MR. GREEN: In that instance, though, we run 

into the problem that Justice Scalia identified and that 

problem is we start to get limitations based upon 

certain factors, and the courts of appeals --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, what's 

the point of looking at the broad range of cases if they 

can't do anything about it?

 MR. GREEN: To see whether -- the point is 

to see whether or not the reasons that are offered in 

those cases turn out to be valid, cogent --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is it right to 

say if the broad range shows that most of these 

defendants get a sentence of 10 years in jail and in 

this case the person got probation, that the court 

should look for some reasons to explain what the 

difference, to justify the difference?

 MR. GREEN: Certainly the court should look 

at the reasons and should look to see whether or not the

reasons are rationally grounded in Section 3553(a). But 

our position is once they are, that's -- that's the end 

of the matter.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, all these 

questions only -- only apply to departures downward from 

the Guidelines, and if you ask the same question with 

regard to departures upward you do run into 

constitutional problems when the -- when courts of 

appeals begin to establish certain facts that have to be 

found in order to move upward or -- yes, certain facts 

that justify moving upward.

 So you end up with a quite skewered system 

in which there is -- there is vigorous hearty review of 

departures downward, but -- but very, very slight review 

of departures upward.

 MR. GREEN: That -- that's correct, and 

that's essentially the kind of system that we've got 

now. This is not a fulsome abuse of discretion review 

throughout the range of sentencing.

 What we have now is a -- on this 

extraordinary circumstances test is a -- and this case 

is a perfect example of substitution of judgment.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What in your view would 

be -- would fail the abuse of discretion test? If we 

have a sentence of -- what was the guideline range?

MR. GREEN: 30 to 37 months, Justice 

Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the judge gives no 

prison time, three years probation. What would it take 

to be -- describe what an abuse of discretion would be?

 MR. GREEN: Well, there are a couple of 

examples out there. One, this case Poynter out of, out 

of the Sixth Circuit, where the judge went all the way 

up to the absolute statutory max in a child 

pornography -- or rather, a child molestation case, on 

the ground that, first, the statutory max will take care 

of any unwarranted disparity. That's not -- that's not 

really a cogent reason and that would be an abuse of 

discretion.

 We have another case out of the -- recently 

out of the Eleventh Circuit, Valdes, in which -- in 

which the court departed upwards on the ground of the 

fact that the check that had been written that -- the 

fraudulent check that had been written, had been written 

to the district court. And so the court was angry that 

its own court had been -- or the neighboring court had 

been duped.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think that's 

unreasonable?

 MR. GREEN: I do think that's unreasonable,

Your Honor. I'll go that far. I'll admit that much. 

Certainly that's not like the famous Yankees and Red Sox 

example. That's not rationally grounded in Section 

3553(a) factors.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, we've been 

talking about a lot of hypotheticals. Is there any 

dispute, any claim that any of the facts on which the 

district judge relied in this case were improper --

MR. GREEN: No.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- that they were out of 

harmony with what's done throughout the country?

 MR. GREEN: No, none whatsoever, Your Honor. 

In fact, we pointed at the end of our merits brief, page 

35 and 36, we point to other cases where courts have 

given lenient sentences because of a voluntary 

rehabilitative effort by the defendant. And the Eighth 

Circuit Court of Appeals said in no way -- or indicated 

in no way did Judge Pratt rely on improper factors in 

deciding the sentence. It had a complaint about his 

reliance on age, but really that was a --

JUSTICE BREYER: What in your opinion is 

supposed to happen if we have Guidelines, a part of 

3553(a), a part of it -- voluntary or not, they're 

referred to, so -- and I understand how you would deal 

with this. If the district judge's sentence rests upon

his view of the facts, the appeals court is supposed to 

say it's the district judge that counts here.

 MR. GREEN: That's right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I can understand if it's a 

question of judgment, a matter of judgment about this 

case the court of appeals is supposed to say: District 

judge, it's your view that matters here.

 Now, the difficult matter is, suppose that 

this district judge says: I don't approve of the way 

Guidelines treat a certain class of people and I am 

going to have a different sentence because I don't like 

what they do. And now there are several situations: 

one, different from his fellow judges in the same court; 

two, different from other judges across the country; 

three, different from what the Guidelines did initially; 

four, different from what the Guidelines say after the 

commission has over and over and over reconsidered the 

same matter.

 All right, that I find difficult and I'd 

like your view.

 MR. GREEN: I would find such an absolute 

policy disagreement difficult as well, Justice Breyer. 

And the reason why it's difficult is because it is not 

sentencing in accordance with Section 3553(a). Section 

3553(a) requires consideration of the individual

characteristics of the defendant and the facts and

 In Koon, this Court --

JUSTICE BREYER: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

 I think what you're saying is that -- which 

is the subject of the next case, really --

MR. GREEN: Exactly.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But I want to know your 

view of it. Too. I want to know your view of it, too, 

because what I want to figure out here by the end of 

today is what are the words that should be written in 

your opinion by this Court that will lead to 

considerable discretion on part of the district judge 

but not totally, not to the point where the uniformity 

goal is easily destroyed.

 That's what I'm asking your view on, and I'd 

like your view and the SG's view and everyone else who's 

arguing today.

 MR. GREEN: The words should be these with 

respect to policy judgments: The district court may 

consider policy disagreements with the Sentencing 

Guidelines or may disagree with the policies stated in 

the Sentencing Guidelines or underlying those 

Guidelines, as long as that disagreement is rationally 

or reasonably grounded in the facts of the case, that it

fits the circumstances of the case.

 And in so doing --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You're saying 

they can't disagree with the policy. They can only --

only say there are special facts in this case that were 

not taken into account in the policy. But you're saying 

they are bound by the policy set forth in the 

Guidelines. That's not my understanding of either 

Apprendi or Booker.

 MR. GREEN: Yes and no. The yes part is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which yes and which no?

 MR. GREEN: Okay. The yes -- the yes part 

is that -- that it is in accordance with the -- the 

majority opinion in Rita and other cases, there is an 

invitation to district courts to reconsider if they 

find -- if they so find it necessary, the facts -- or 

rather, excuse me, the policies as articulated in the 

Sentencing Guidelines. They are free to do that.

 But under Section 3553(a), Justice Scalia, 

that has to be rationally grounded in the case before 

them. This --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be relevant to 

the case, Of course.

 MR. GREEN: Certainly.

MR. GREEN: Relevance and rational --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you mean 

by rationally grounded in the case before them. Let's 

take the question of whether you should give higher 

sentences for crack cocaine than for powder cocaine. 

Why can't the district court simply disagree with the 

fact that the Guidelines said you should give a 100 

times more for the one than for the other? Why can't 

the district court just say, that seems to me a very 

erroneous judgment by -- by the Sentencing Commission?

 MR. GREEN: If the district court applied 

that as a policy across all cases that come before it 

involving crack or powder cocaine, Justice Scalia, that 

is an abdication of the district court's duty under 

Section 3553(a). And under this Court's opinion --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. It must follow the 

Guidelines,

 MR. GREEN: No, no, I'm not, I'm not saying 

that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It just has to consider 

them. It did consider them and said: I disagree with 

that judgment of the Guidelines.

 MR. GREEN: Yes, it has to -- it does not 

have to follow the Guidelines and it can disagree, but 

it has to tie that disagreement to the facts of the

case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: This case involves cocaine.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying -- you're 

saying two things. You're saying it's got to follow the 

Guidelines -- it can depart from the Guidelines, but 

it's got to do so based on the facts of this case or in 

some way relevant to the facts of this case. And when 

you put that latter criterion in there, what you're 

saying, and I think this was Justice Scalia's concern, 

you're really saying you've got to find that this case 

is somehow an outlier to the broad range of cases so 

that the policy does not fit. And that's a different 

thing from a general disagreement with the policy 

itself.

 Isn't that what you are saying?

 MR. GREEN: No, because I don't think a 

district judge would have to find that the case was 

somehow an outlier.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then what is it in the 

facts of this case that is crucial to the appropriate 

determination?

 MR. GREEN: Well, the facts of a case where 

there's a disagreement with a policy might be, for 

example, the policy might be -- let's take embezzlement 

because I don't want to tread on my colleague's

argument. Let's take embezzlement --

JUSTICE ALITO: Maybe you could take age. 

What is there about the age of this defendant? He was a 

21-year-old college student? Now maybe age is generally 

a factor that should be considered as a basis for 

leniency. Maybe it's not. But it's a policy question. 

What is there about the facts of this case that -- that 

changes that?

 MR. GREEN: Age is a good example. Justice 

-- or, excuse me -- Judge Pratt in his sentencing 

memorandum, said -- cited studies that show that young 

people's risk inhibition behavior is not quite as well 

developed as people later on, and that recidivism drops 

remarkably as you move forward into your 20s.

 Now, he did not rely on that argument in 

order to impose the sentence he did. He used that as a 

contrast to say this where is Brian Gall was when he was 

a member of this conspiracy and look at where he has 

gotten to, having fully rehabilitated himself.

 So that is a means by which a judge can say, 

you know, the policy of the Guidelines may be that age 

should be a discouraged factor, but it could be relevant 

in cases.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. But if the reasoning 

that you just articulated is reasoning that should be

accepted, it's reasoning that should be accepted in 

every case. And it -- i.e., the mind is less -- the 

brain is less developed in the case of everyone under a 

certain age.

 And that amounts, in effect, to a rejection 

of the policy for a certain swath of individuals, 

relatively young individuals, for whom the judge is 

saying age is relevant, the policy says age is not.

 That's rejection of the policy.

 MR. GREEN: But not necessarily, because a 

district judge who is looking the defendant in the eye, 

and is the best placed judicial actor to make that 

decision, may say I see a 21-year-old in front of me who 

is uniquely mature. That is a -- that is a 

quintessential multifarious, pleading, narrow, shifting 

fact; the district judge may make the decision.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You're saying that if a 

judge disagrees as a general matter of policy, once in a 

while he could make an exception to his disagreement. 

But it's still, it seems to me, on your reasoning, that 

he has rejected the policy with respect to a certain 

class of defendant.

 MR. GREEN: Well, he -- he may have rejected 

it -- if -- I wouldn't even -- dare say that in a 

multiplicity of cases. He may have rejected it in this

particular case and said, I see a defendant in front of 

me who is immature, as mature as the other defendants, 

and this study backs me up.

 And I'd like to reserve the reminder of my 

time for rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll give you 

rebuttal time, Mr. Green, but I just have one question.

 I think we've gotten off the track a little 

bit. The question presented is about the extraordinary 

circumstances test and proportionality review. We've 

been talking a lot about what district court judges can 

do. What's wrong with, whatever you want to call it, 

saying if something is out of the norm, you ought to 

have some good reason for being out of the norm?

 MR. GREEN: I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the only 

question presented in this case.

 MR. GREEN: Because it -- because it sets a 

presumptive sentence and that presumptive sentence is 

exactly like -- is the Guideline sentence. And it says 

to the district court: You must overcome a presumption 

against a sentence that is some unspecified distance 

from -- from the Guidelines. We don't know because we 

can't estimate exactly how far it's from.

 But what happens, and what will quickly

happen, is that there's going to be a kind of -- maybe 

in the Eighth Circuit it's one standard deviation; maybe 

in the Second Circuit it's two standard deviations. But 

pretty soon we are going to have a kind of Guidelines 

with a penumbra beyond which you can't go.

 It is, as was indicated in the Rita opinion, 

a presumption of unreasonableness.  It says to the 

district court, you're making a risk if you go outside 

the Guidelines.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN,

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 Appellate courts confronted with the task of 

conducting reasonableness review need some benchmarks 

for how to distinguish between sentences that are 

outside the Guidelines and reasonable and sentences that 

are outside the Guidelines and are not.

 The question presented here is whether an 

appellate court can reasonably decide that it should 

take a harder look at a case that is significantly or

extraordinarily outside the Guidelines and look to see 

whether that sentence is supported by --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Excuse me, may I ask this 

question because it comes up throughout your brief, and 

you've used percentages to decide when a case is 

sufficiently outside the Guidelines to justify a special 

hard look. You used the term "dramatically" in your 

brief. At what percentage point is the threshold that 

this standard of review kicks in?

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens, we don't have 

a fixed percentage. We don't endorse that kind of 

analysis.

 I think that the appropriate way to look at 

it is to see all different factors converging in order 

to determine whether it warrants this harder look. It 

could be a different type of sentence. Here you have a 

probation sentence as opposed to a prison sentence when 

the Guidelines call for up to three years of 

imprisonment.

 It could be couched in the number of levels 

that the judge has --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So you do not rely on a 

percentage as kind of the magic basic test?

 MR. DREEBEN: I don't. But I would say --

of appeals seem to.

 MR. DREEBEN: The courts of appeals have 

generally relied on a "I know it when I see it" kind of 

approach, which I think is reasonable in this area of 

the law, because you see sentences that are simply out 

of kilter with what the Guidelines range is, and it 

raises a question in the court's mind, why?

 If you saw a judge who said the Guidelines 

range here is 30 to 37 months for petitioner and I'm 

going to sentence him to 24 months and the judge gives 

the same reasons as he gave here, no court of appeals is 

going to think this requires a particularly hard look or 

any greater justification than what the judge did. The 

court will understand that that's what abuse of 

discretion review means in an advisory system.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if the 

sentencing judge simply disagrees with the Guidelines? 

He just simply disagrees with the severity of the 

sentence that the Guidelines impose? He's free to do 

that, isn't he?

 MR. DREEBEN: He is, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And so long as that 

disagreement is reasonable, so long as another 

sentencing commission might indeed have imposed a lower 

sentence -- for antitrust violations, if indeed all the

Federal Courts before -- before the Guidelines came into 

effect were rarely imposing any prison sentences, how 

could you say it would be unreasonable for a district 

judge to say, I simply agrees with what the 

Guidelines -- with what the Sentencing Commission did, 

and I agree with all of those sentencing courts before 

then, which thought -- which thought only in a rare case 

should there be jail time? How could you possibly say 

that that's unreasonable?

 MR. DREEBEN: Because, Justice Scalia, I 

start with a fundamentally different concept of 

reasonableness review than merely is it possible to 

articulate a reasoned basis for sentencing the defendant 

that way.

 I start with the proposition that this Court 

adopted reasonableness review in Booker as a means of 

helping to achieve Congress's objective of increased 

uniformity without attempting to attain the degree of 

uniformity that had prevailed under the mandatory --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But we also made it very 

clear that the Guidelines are advisory, and there is --

there is no way to a maintain that with the -- with the 

kind of approach that you're offering. They aren't 

advisory. They're pretty much mandatory. You depart 

too much and you'll be called to account.

MR. DREEBEN: I think there's a difference, 

Justice Scalia, from saying that the Guidelines are 

advisory and therefore a court can give a different 

sentence than what the Guidelines call for, and saying 

that basically advisory guidelines means the judge can 

do whatever policy judgment the judge wants, without 

regard to what degree of variance you achieve. From --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You cannot disagree on 

policy with the Guidelines, then, at least not 

fundamentally?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, you can disagree 

fundamentally, and I think at one level every variance 

is a disagreement with the sentence that the Guidelines 

would produce.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know how that --

that fits in with your prior statement.

 MR. DREEBEN: It fits in with my prior 

statement because what'S at issue in a case like this is 

not whether the judge can disagree with the judgment of 

the Guidelines and say youth matters, but whether the 

judge can do so to such an extent that the result is 

unwarranted disparity beyond what needs to be tolerated 

in order to achieve a system that complies with the 

Sixth Amendment.

a fairness component to the Guidelines in reasonableness 

review.

 MR. DREEBEN: I'm saying that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: When you start talking 

about disparity, you're talking about a fairness across 

a range of sentencing that is actually imposed.

 So you're saying -- I think you're saying, 

there's got to be a kind of substantive fairness 

component to it.

 MR. DREEBEN: There has to be a substantive 

fairness component, Justice Souter, and I think that 

there has to be a substantive excessiveness component. 

In other words --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's kind after 

subset, isn't it?

 MR. DREEBEN: I actually view it as the 

broader category but I think the two of them work 

together.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. DREEBEN: This is the fundamental 

difference that I think exists between what Petitioner 

is offering and what the government is offering. We all 

agree that irrational sentences and procedurally 

defective sentences are to be set aside on 

reasonableness review. But where we disagree, I think,

is whether a judge on a court of appeals panel can look 

at the results reached by the district judge and 

conclude, this is an excessive sentence on the facts of 

this case.

 We think that the judge can do that on a 

court of appeals and that in order to determine whether 

a sentence is excessive, a starting point is to compare 

what the judge did to what the Guidelines range does.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then you're 

just blowing smoke when you say that the Guidelines are 

advisory. What you're saying is the criterion for 

fairness is the Guidelines and if you go too far one 

side or the other of the Guidelines, you're not being 

fair. That -- that's not -- that's not advisory. 

That's the Guidelines as a criterion of sentencing.

 MR. DREEBEN: Unless, Justice Scalia, the 

judge offers sufficiently cogent, persuasive reasons so 

that the court of appeals concludes that this is indeed 

a reasonable sentence, given the reasons that the judge 

has articulated as a matter of policy and the facts 

before him.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he did that here. He 

said, you know, I think a young person like this --

other people may feel differently, but I think somebody 

at 21 really is -- is not -- his brain isn't fully

formed and we should give him another chance.

 MR. DREEBEN: He -- he did say that Justice 

Scalia. But appellate review is conducted through the 

lens of 3553(a) and 3553(a) directs the judge to 

consider a variety of things in addition to the history 

and characteristics of the defendant, which is where 

youth comes in. It also directs the court to consider 

the severity of the offense and the need for just 

punishment. It directs the court to consider deterrence 

considerations, and it directs the court to consider the 

need to avoid unwarranted disparities between similarly 

situated defendants, and that's where this court fell 

down.

 It's not that what the court said was wholly 

unreasonable, although in one respect, I think, with the 

emphasis on withdrawal for the reasons that Justice 

Ginsburg mentioned, the judge did overstate the point. 

But the judge lost sight of the fact that this is a 

defendant who over a 7-month period engaged in a 

sustained drug conspiracy at age 21, not as an 

adolescent, and made 30 to $40,000 for that.

 And the result is that this judge 

concluded that defendant --

there are any facts that would have justified probation

for this particular crime?

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes. I think that there are 

cases throughout the Federal system that have resulted 

in probation for defendants who committed similar crimes 

to this, maybe not as severe as this defendant. I'm not 

sure --

between the facts in this case and the ones which you 

would find acceptable?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the ones that, I think, 

have been the most appealing for probation sentences are 

cases in which the defendant's culpability is very low. 

The defendant played a minor role in the offense, 

perhaps assisting a boyfriend or a friend --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm asking about whether 

in cases exactly involving the crime we have here, 

whether any such cases would justify probation, where 

the culpability was exactly the same as there was here.

 MR. DREEBEN: The only cases that I can 

think of -- and I was trying to get to this point, 

Justice Stevens -- are ones in which courts conclude 

there are compelling family circumstances where 

individuals will be very badly hurt in the defendant's 

family if no one is available to take care of them, and 

the defendant has really devoted his activities to doing

that, and there's no replacement; and the costs to 

society would be too high in those circumstances, courts 

have concluded, to justify a sentence of imprisonment.

 I'm not saying that Petitioner is the most 

culpable defendant that could be sentenced under this 

statute. This is a statute that carries a range --

JUSTICE BREYER: This is exactly the kind of 

case, though, that I think would give tremendous 

discretion to the district judge. Because, as I just 

listened to you, you are listing a whole lot of features 

of it that are very case-specific, that require thorough 

knowledge of fact and thorough knowledge of the kind of 

judgment, a kind of individualized judgment, that 

sentencing judges are supposed to do.

 And that's what's worrying me about the test 

that the circuit court gives here. It lumps together 

things like what you just talked about with other things 

like: I don't agree with the policy of the guideline, 

itself. And this is a typical case and, therefore, I 

think we should look to try to find ways to unpack the 

sentence that it used, the statement -- you know, the 

worse it is, the worse the harder you look, et cetera, 

because that doesn't tell us much at all.

 It suggests a proportionate test, 

mathematical, which must be wrong. It must be wrong

because the same degree of departure could result from a 

view of an abuse of a vulnerable victim as could result 

from a total misunderstanding of what robbery is about.

 Now, it's not the percentage there that 

matters. It's the rationale. It is what the judge did. 

And can you unpack it? We just did in the last 

discussion try to unpack that, and we continue in the 

next case to try to do it.

 What we want -- I think what we want -- is 

to interpret that word "reasonable" so that we get back 

to a situation where judges do depart when they have 

something unusual and maybe occasionally when they think 

the guideline wasn't considered properly, and then the 

iterative process takes over, going back to the 

commission. Now, how do we get there?

 MR. DREEBEN: Let me try to draw one 

distinction and make a point about proportionality that 

I think is not encompassed within what you said.

 There is a distinction between a judge 

forming a view based on the defendant's character and 

behavior in front of the court and the history as 

revealed in the presentence report where the judge has 

an institutional advantage over an appellate court for 

obvious reasons. And this was recognized in Koon versus 

United States. It hasn't changed today.

On the other hand, a district court has a 

disadvantage, really, in formulating broad policy as 

compared to the Sentencing Commission. Because the 

Sentencing Commission has the ability to absorb vast 

amounts of data and to consider the views of all 

segments of the criminal justice community and to 

respond to Congress. And it is really the component of 

the sentencing process where you would expect broad 

policy to be, as an initial matter, best formulated. 

Now --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We should probably make 

them mandatory.

 MR. DREEBEN: As I said to Justice Scalia, 

they're not mandatory, and the judge does have the 

freedom to challenge the judgment that the Sentencing 

Commission has drawn. But on appellate review, the 

normal factors that go into which institutional actor is 

best situated to decide a question tilts in favor of a 

more rigorous form of review for pure policy 

disagreements for not only the reason that the 

Sentencing Commission is better, but for the reason that 

if you license all district courts to come up with their 

own broad, abstract policies, you end up with 474 

sentencing commissions who are operating --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, on that ground I

understand perfectly, and were we to write that into a 

paragraph in the opinion, this case still, would it not, 

be the strongest case imaginable for discretion to the 

district judge?

 MR. DREEBEN: I hope not, Justice Breyer. 

And I hope to --

JUSTICE BREYER: You did, but I wanted to 

know what you were going to say.

 MR. DREEBEN: As I said, the Section 3553(a) 

process is a holistic one. There are seven different 

factors listed in Section 3553(a); and the commission, 

when it formulated the Guidelines, looked at the same 

sorts of factors and attempted to balance them.

 This judge here did not devote particularly 

significant consideration at all to the fact that 

Petitioner sold 10,000 ecstasy pills, which have the 

potential for causing significant harm.

 And he earned a great deal of money out of 

it. He didn't give the money back. He may have 

invested it in the house that he bought.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm sure that the 

prosecutor argued that, and the judge heard it, and he 

listed what thought were the key factors.

 You made a distinction between a sentence 

could be rational but not reasonable. And I'm

accustomed to understanding rationality review as 

equivalent to reasonableness review, but you made a 

distinction between those two. So I get your idea of 

rationality passes the lunatic test. What is 

reasonableness?

 MR. DREEBEN: Reasonableness requires more 

of a balance of the policies and a consideration of the 

overall goal of the system of achieving uniformity.

 And I think perhaps the best way to 

illustrate the point is through a hypothetical similar 

to the one that Justice Kennedy posed. Suppose that a 

district judge, confronting Petitioner, said: You were 

a college student. You had every advantage in life. 

You were 21; you weren't a kid. You made $40,000 over 

seven months. And when it suited you, you pulled out, 

and you did nothing to disrupt the conspiracy.

 Now, I have a statutory range here of zero 

to 20. And, although the guidelines call only for 30 to 

37 months, I think you should go to jail for 15 years.

 I don't see Petitioner as really offering a 

court of appeals or the criminal-justice system as a 

whole a way for someone to step in and say that's 

excessive. It doesn't leave room to make reasoned 

distinctions among the kinds of defendants who violate 

this statute, and it doesn't provide any check on

aberrant or outlier outcomes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We're trying to development 

a rule here that can be applied sensibly by all the 

courts of appeals when they are reviewing the 

innumerable sentences of federal district judges.

 And you have -- you haven't given me a rule. 

I have no idea -- if I were sitting on the court of 

appeals, I would have no idea when I can do it and when 

I can't do it.

 The notion of reasonableness, you know, 

whether a reasonable person could have given a sentence 

of this sort despite the fact that it is not what the 

Sentencing Commission did, that's -- that's something 

you can work with, but I don't understand what your rule 

is.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, the competing 

rule of mere rationality or the judge did something 

that's reasonable is pretty much a one-way ticket to 

disparity. Because it means that every district judge 

would get the opportunity to say: I've seen the 

guidelines, but I don't agree; and, as a result, I'm 

giving the 15-year sentence to Mr. Gall versus all the 

way down to probation, and the courts of appeals would 

have to affirm both.

 Now, I am trying --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't say -- I 

wouldn't say that. There are -- there are certain --

certain limits where you would -- the example you gave 

of that kind of an acceleration of the penalty, and I 

can see giving this person no jail time whatever would 

be extreme.

 But if you are trying to get a narrow range 

of sentences out of the guidelines, it seems to me 

you're just working in opposition to what our opinions 

have said which is that the guidelines are advisory. 

And they're not mandatory.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the question I think 

here is how advisory do they have to be in order to 

comply with this Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence 

and the remedial opinion in Booker, as I understand it, 

answered that question by saying they're not mandatory, 

but the features of the appellate review and continued 

existence of the sentencing commission are going to work 

significantly to achieving Congress's objectives of 

increased uniformity. And the nine courts of appeals 

that have adopted proportionality review, even if they 

may have used slightly different words to express it, 

are -- I think, responding to a fundamental intuition, 

which is how do I know if the sentence in front of me is 

likely to be significantly outside the norm.

And second, if it is, should I not look for 

more to sustain it than a sentence that's co-extensive 

with the guidelines sentence.

 I think this case is really the counterpart 

case to the Rita case that the Court decided last term 

when that judgment of the sentencing court and the 

district judge -- the sentencing commission and the 

district judge coincide, courts of appeals can assume 

it's likely, although not definitely true -- but likely 

that the sentence is a reasonable one. But when the 

sentence is significantly outside what the guidelines 

would call for on an average case of that type --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, you are 

saying that you admit there's no presumption of 

unreasonable merely because it is outside but there is a 

presumption of reasonable if it dramatically or 

significantly is outside and you don't define 

dramatically or significantly?

 MR. DREEBEN: I am not able to give the 

Court a rigid definition of it.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You are not able to give 

any definition. You disavow a percentage. You just 

come up with nothing else. Just the word dramatically. 

You do say it is a presumption at that point by --

for as a presumption, but if the Court wants to conclude 

that it does function like a presumption, I would still 

submit it is a perfectly valid presumption under these 

circumstances.

 It is not that the court of appeals --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you should --

I'm sorry. But I mean -- the only purpose of the 

presumption under your view is to trigger some inquiry 

into the reasons.

 MR. DREEBEN: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under 3553(a), 

district courts have to provide reasons anyway, right.

 MR. DREEBEN: They do.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if there is no 

explanation of the reasons it is going to be invalid 

under the statute, quite apart from any presumption of 

unreasonableness.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the presumption of 

unreasonableness goes a little bit farther than that, 

Mr. Chief Justice, because it allows the court of 

appeals to take notice that this is a sentence that if 

upheld holds the potential for unwarranted disparity. 

And it may be that the sentence doesn't pose that risk 

at all. But the reasons that the judge gave to justify 

that sentence should be somewhat commensurate or

proportionate to the degree of the variance, otherwise 

you're basically back to a system where so long as the 

judge can go through the facts of the case and give a 

rational explanation of why a sentence should be at that 

level, there's nothing for the appellate court to do but 

to affirm.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't that always true? 

A judge should always give reasons commensurate with the 

problem. So what if we added by saying remember give 

reasons commensurate with the problem? I see something 

we've lost. What we've lost is we've sort of pulled 

across the screen here a rather murky curtain called 

"something of a presumption," which we can't quite 

define, which will lead to lawyers making endless 

arguments about whether this murky curtain -- they're on 

one side of it or the other. So let's sweep its aside. 

Let's get to the underlying facts.

 MR. DREEBEN: What you'd be doing I think, 

Justice Breyer, is sweeping aside the approach that nine 

circuits have taken.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's correct.

 MR. DREEBEN: Which have usefully 

facilitated their appellate review. They didn't select 

the standard because they drew it out of an opinion from 

this Court. They selected the standard because they

considered it essentially a rule of reason. The rule 

being that under an advisory guideline system, we must 

accept that there will be considerably less uniformity 

than under a mandatory system. That's appropriate. But 

we don't have to accept the proposition that materially 

outlier sentences that are not supported by an adequate 

explanation should stand. And if the courts of appeals 

are told, you go back to the drawing board now, you 

can't use any kind of proportionality test, I think 

unless the Court gives them something that will allow 

them to distinguish between a materially out of 

guideline sentence that is reasonable and one that is 

not, the ultimate result will be every district judge 

knowing that in their courtroom, they can decide 

whatever they like about the fundamental policies of 

sentences, and it will stand.

 The reason why the sentencing guidelines 

system was originally adopted was to eliminate each 

district judge operating purely on that judge's 

philosophy.

 JUSTICE BREYER: We were making progress? I 

thought our last discussion -- we were making progress 

on this very point, where we have the judgmental 

matters, the fact finding matters, and the pure policy 

matters, and we distinguished the latter from the first

two?

 If you were a district judge, wouldn't you 

find it more enlightening to talk in those terms?

 MR. DREEBEN: No. I think that what the 

district judges need to understand is that they're not 

bound by the guidelines, but the guidelines remain 

something that is a reference point, that if deviations 

or variances are warranted, they should be explained, 

and they should be explained in a way that's consistent 

with the degree of the variance. Because the 

alternative of wholesale abdication to the district 

judge to assess the individual facts of the case means 

that one district judge can conclude that a defendant 

like Mr. Gall warrants probation, and another one can 

conclude that he warrants 10 or 15 years, and there'll 

be no remedy on appeal because it will all be very 

case-specific. It won't be policy driven disagreements. 

Most of what goes on in Federal sentencing is not 

fundamentally a deep-rooted policy disagreement of the 

nature of the kind that Justice Scalia and I were 

discussing, about whether white collar defendants should 

go to jail at all.

 Most of it is about how do the particular 

features of this individual defendant match up with the 

policy considerations --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, can I ask 

another question? I go back to percentages for just --

to illustrate the point. You say that the justification 

has to be responsive to the extent of the departure. 

And you -- you kind of disavow percentages that trigger 

-- you say substantial. But how do you measure the 

strength of justifications? For example in this case, 

there were four or five justifications -- withdrawal 

from a conspiracy, youth, that he got over alcoholism, 

so forth. Is the judge supposed to put a percentage 

value on each of those justifications and see if they 

add up to the percentage? And if not, aren't you 

comparing oranges and apples?

 MR. DREEBEN: It is more of a wholistic and 

judgmental process than a mathematical one, Justice 

Stevens. And I am reluctant to offer percentages 

because I don't want to be mistaken for saying there is 

some litmus test with superguidelines, ranges -- but I 

can say that courts of appeals that find a variance to 

warrant a substantial or extraordinary justification are 

typically looking at 40 to 50 to 60 percent away from 

the guidelines range, not sentences that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that call for a 40 to 

50 percent justification?

 MR. DREEBEN: It calls for one that makes

sense given the degree of the various --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But don't you read the 

court of appeals opinions as in effect saying we've got 

to get a percentage that matches the percentage of 

departure?

 MR. DREEBEN: Linguistically, the words used 

are, you need a compelling reason for an extraordinary 

departure -- an extraordinary reason for an 

extraordinary departure or variance. So in that sense, 

I agree with you. But the court of appeals have not 

attempted to create a mathematical grid, because such an 

exercise would be both contrary to the notion of 

advisory guidelines, and also one that is inherently 

arbitrary. And that's why I said that it is 

unfortunately more in the nature of, I know it when I 

see it, but I don't think that this is as bad as the 

predicament the Court found itself in in obscenity 

cases, because it really isn't that hard to tell the 

difference between a variance that is a few months 

outside the range or even a variance in the facts of 

this Gall case, say down to 15 months, and a sentence 

that just wipes out all prison time altogether.

 I don't think the Court should have any 

difficulty saying that if a judge is just going to wipe 

out all prison time --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you -- if it 

wipes it out entirely, does that make this case 

different or like a case in which the maximum was say --

was 30 years instead of 30 months? Are they both to be 

judged by the same standard on the justification?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, in this case, because 

the government believes that the guidelines provide a 

reference point for proportionality review, a sentence 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing the guidelines 

provided 30 years? Would the justification for 

probation in that case have to be just as strong as in

really irrelevant --

percentage is irrelevant, if you said it has to be 

stronger in that case.

substantial period of imprisonment, and a judge says, I

just don't think the culpability of white collar 

offenders ever warrants sending them to jail, I think 

the better approach is you have them go out and make 

speeches to fellow potential defendants about how 

terrible their experience was, that is something that's 

going to produce a very widespread potential for 

disparity.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, you're --

you're arguing hereby in a case where the departure was 

downward, but you're -- the principle you apply, you 

would apply for upward departures as well?

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't there get to be a 

constitutional problem where -- where the court which is 

establishing these -- these ranges that you want has 

held, after a series of decisions, that basically you 

cannot get 30 percent over -- over the guideline range 

unless particular facts exist? And it has specified 

those -- those facts in prior decisions. At that point, 

in order to go 30, you know, 30 percent above the 

guidelines, that fact becomes necessary for the 

conviction and -- or for the sentence, and, therefore, 

you would need the jury to find it.

review should in effect construct their own guidelines 

system. They should respond to the reasons and the 

facts that are before them.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what common law 

adjudication always amounts to. By trial and error, one 

case, the next case, you eventually end up knowing what 

is necessary in order to give 30 -- 30 percent over.

 Unless you're accomplishing that, I don't 

know what you're accomplishing.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I -- I think you're not 

accomplishing that kind of a common law system in 

reasonableness review for many of the reasons that the 

Court has already identified in describing why an 

abuse-of-discretion approach is warranted. The court of 

appeals will not be saying that this is the maximum 

sentence you could give on these facts. It would say 

these -- this is an unreasonable or a reasonable 

sentence based on the policy considerations that the 

judge articulated and the facts that he relied on.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He said this fact is okay. 

You can go 30 percent above with this fact. So then in 

the next case, the district judge says, I find that this 

fact exists and therefore you get 30 percent above the 

max, and the court of appeals affirms, but the jury has 

never found that fact.

MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia, I think 

that the fundamental question of whether there is 

substantive reasonableness review for excessiveness was 

settled in the Rita an opinion in which -- Rita 

recognized that Booker contemplated --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It left open -- it left 

open case-by-case adjudication. It left -- application 

review. And I'm saying that in the application review 

of that case, you'd have to say you needed a jury 

finding.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, my response -- and if I 

could answer Mr. Chief Justice -- is that the 

fundamental point of this Court's Apprendi line of cases 

is that, so long as the statutory maximum is legally 

available to the judge, the judge can find facts within 

that range that justify the sentence, and that's all the 

Booker remedial opinion authorizes judges to do.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Dreeben.

 Mr. Green, you have a minute remaining. Why 

don't you take three?

Most bluntly, an I-know-it-when-I-see-it 

test or a holistic test is not likely to generate much 

in the way of warranted uniformity either.

 Justice Scalia, you pointed out, in your 

question about whether this sentence was excessive or 

not on the basis of the -- of the facts, that the 

government is blowing smoke with respect to its 

statement that the guidelines is purely advisory. Well, 

it's not only doing that; it's removing the exercise of 

discretion by the district judge.

 It's saying to the district judge, you must 

demonstrate to us facts. You must come to us with facts 

that not only consist of explanations of reasons but are 

sufficiently persuasive or compelling to overcome our 

natural resistance to an outside-the-guidelines 

sentence.

 That I submit is, as articulated earlier, 

making the guidelines presumptive. And it imposes a 

fact-finding requirement that is in violation of the 

Sixth Amendment.

 Justice Ginsburg, you asked about whether 

the prosecutor had, in fact, heard all of the evidence 

with respect to -- or stated all the evidence to the 

district court with respect to Mr. Gall. The answer to 

that question is he most certainly did. And I agree

with my colleague that this case is the mirror of Rita. 

In Rita, the district judge was presented with a wealth 

of facts about Mr. Rita's prior good works, his military 

service, et cetera.

 Here, the district judge was again presented 

with a wealth of facts with respect to Mr. Gall's 

voluntary rehabilitation, with respect to his having 

grown, developed, and established a business and rid 

himself of crime and drugs. And this district judge 

exercised his discretion to go down on the basis of 

those facts and imposed a sentence of probation.

 And, Justice Stevens, the Eighth Circuit, 

even before the Guidelines, even before the Booker case, 

in 1993, in 1999, in cases called One Star and Decora 

respectively, went down from even higher levels to 

probation based upon the particular facts of the case.

 We would ask the Court to overturn the 

judgment of the Eighth Circuit and abandon the 

extraordinary circumstances test.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you Mr. Green. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
