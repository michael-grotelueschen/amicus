 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in case 05-1284, Watson versus Philip Morris 

Companies. 

Mr. Frederick.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The Eighth Circuit held that Philip Morris 

is subject to such specific and detailed regulations by 

the Federal Trade Commission that it is entitled to 

remove this purely State law case from State court to 

Federal court under the Federal officer removal statute. 

That holding is erroneous and should be reversed for at 

least three reasons.

 First, the court articulated the wrong test 

for determining when a person is acting under a Federal 

officer.

 Second, the court misunderstood the Federal 

Trade Commission's regulatory regime with respect to the 

marketing of so-called light cigarettes.

 And third, the court's approach ignores the 

long history and purposes of the federal officer removal

provision to protect the Federal Government operations 

from interference by State court proceedings.

 In this case, and in this Court, Philip 

Morris largely abandons the Eighth Circuit's rationale 

and offers an alternate ground of affirmance. It should 

be rejected. The FTC has not delegated authority to 

conduct testing to Philip Morris, and the complaint in 

any event challenges only the company's marketing and 

not its testing of so-called light cigarettes.

 Now with respect to the first point, the 

Eighth Circuit applied and articulated the wrong test 

for determining when a person is acting under a federal 

officer. The proper test, as this Court's case in the 

City of Greenwood versus Peacock Casey elucidates, is 

when the person is aiding or acting on behalf of the 

Federal officer in a subordinate role in the officer's 

discharge of official functions. That is not what is 

happening here.

 What is happening here is that the Federal 

Trade Commission for a time conducted testing on the tar 

and nicotine levels of cigarettes and stopped doing so. 

Philip Morris asserts that that sequence of events 

caused, in effect, a delegation of this authority. But 

what is really happening is that Philip Morris --

document or statement --

MR. FREDERICK: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that constitutes the 

delegation?

 MR. FREDERICK: No. There is nothing, 

Justice Scalia. There is no regulation, this is no 

order, there is no policy statement, there is no 

statement by the chairman of the FTC before Congress. 

There is nothing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's perfectly 

all right for them to adopt a new method of testing tar 

and nicotine that yields numbers that are far lower than 

the Government's method, and to publish an ad saying 

these are our tar and nicotine figures, and the FTC 

would have no problem with that?

 MR. FREDERICK: Mr. Chief Justice, the 

answer to your question is no. And the reason is that 

what the FTC did at the time was, it determined that 

this particular Cambridge filter method was the 

preferred method for ascertaining the level of tar and 

nicotine in cigarettes. And in the D.C. Circuit 

opinion of Federal --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not just the 

preferred method, but presumably the only one they would 

allow. If you used another one, they would bring a

deceptive trade practices action very quickly.

 MR. FREDERICK: That is correct. But what 

was clear in the Brown & Williamson case decided by the 

D.C. Circuit, a panel of Judges Bork, Scalia and 

Edwards --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They still might 

have gotten it right.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. FREDERICK: They most assuredly did get 

it right, Mr. Chief Justice. What they held was that 

that method, the Cambridge filter method, had not been 

done according to rulemaking, a trade regulation rule; 

and that, therefore, there might be a testing mechanism 

that would be different and better, but that with 

respect to undertaking the deception analysis, which is 

what the FTC is charged by -- with doing under Section 5 

of the Federal Trade Commission -- Federal Trade Act, it 

had to determine whether or not there would be some 

method that the cigarette makers were attempting to use 

that would be deceptive; and what the court in the D.C. 

Circuit held was that there was no other method that had 

been determined at that time. There had been no 

statement or proposed rule made by the FTC, and so for 

purposes of determining deception, that was the best 

that could be done, while leaving open the possibility

that the FTC would promulgate the appropriate --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I understand 

you have a dispute about whether that is this case, but 

there are many areas where the Government requires 

testing of products. You know, the strength of seat 

belts and stuff, and they specify very precise means to 

which those tests have to be conducted.

 And if someone, a manufacturer is complying 

with those requirements, and a challenge is brought, 

saying something to the effect that that test doesn't 

give you a good measure or something, in that situation 

would this removal provision apply?

 MR. FREDERICK: No. Because that's merely 

compliance with rule and not aiding or acting on behalf 

of the Government officer in a subordinate relationship 

in the discharge of function.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the 

Government says you've got to test your cars, you know, 

every three months or something, and you've got to send 

us the results of a random -- random test?

 MR. FREDERICK: The reporting of results 

doesn't change the hypothetical. That's also compliance 

with the law, and that happens all the time in the 

Government. The Department of Labor, the Department of 

Commerce, the Federal Reserve, all of those agencies

routinely require reporting on the part of industry.

 But the reporting of information does not 

transform a regulated entity into a Federal officer for 

purposes of these cases. And the court's cases are 

highly instructive in this regard. Beginning with the 

act of 1815 that began the Federal officer removal, the 

court's cases have held that when a person is deemed to 

be acting under, the person is acting in a subordinate 

relationship to the Federal officer, merely complying 

with the law does not transform a regulated entity into 

someone subordinate to the officer.

 And that subordinate relationship is what is 

critical to understanding when in other contexts someone 

might have a better claim to being a person acting under 

a Federal officer than Philip Morris can assert in this 

case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That is -- this is 

certainly not your revenue officer needing help from a 

citizen or the Federal agent going to close down a still 

during Prohibition. But what about the Government 

contractor cases that are cited, the Agent Orange was 

one example?

 MR. FREDERICK: The Government contractor 

cases present a quite distinct set of issues that, of 

course, is not present in this case because there is no

contract between the Federal Trade Commission and Philip 

Morris. But I think that the proper way of looking at 

Government contractors is to look at contextually what 

is the nature of the contract? Does the contract 

provide for ongoing supervision by the Federal officer 

and give the Federal officer the power to change or 

alter the conduct of the contracting party? Otherwise, 

mere specifications, detailed as they might be, 

constitute simply compliance with the terms of the 

contract rather than a subordinate relationship.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do all these contracting 

cases involve the contractor imposing law upon somebody, 

executing law? On behalf of the Government?

 MR. FREDERICK: In a couple --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Because that's your test. 

I mean, and if that is the proper test, it ought to 

apply in the Government contractor situation, too.

 So, for example, the Government can hire a 

private company run prisons; but that would be the 

Government hiring somebody to perform Government --

Government functions. Now, do all of those -- a 

function that remain as Government function, keeping the 

incarcerated incarcerated. Now do, do all of the 

contract cases involve that?

 MR. FREDERICK: No. I think and that's why

it would be --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --

MR. FREDERICK: -- a mistake for the Court 

to either categorically say all Government contractors 

are in or all Government contractors are out.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that puts a whole new 

theory on your --

MR. FREDERICK: No, it doesn't.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.

 MR. FREDERICK: Because my theory is that 

the person acting under has to be aiding or acting on 

behalf of a Federal officer in a subordinate 

relationship in the performance of the officer's 

official functions. And in the case of some Government 

contractors, like the chauffeur in Maryland versus 

Soper, for instance, who was an employee of the Reliable 

Transfer Company, he was hired by the Maryland Director 

of Prohibition to serve with the agents when they went 

out doing their investigations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And he was acting under 

color of law as you've described that in your petitions? 

I don't think so.

 MR. FREDERICK: That's a different question, 

Justice Scalia. The question of under color of office

as the statute defines it depends on the nature of the 

acts and whether there is a causal relationship between 

the acts that are charged by the State in the State case 

and the actions of the people involved.

 In the Soper case, the problem wasn't the 

color of office, because the chauffeur was out with the 

four agents, and when there was a death that they 

stumbled upon, the question arose what were the nature 

of the facts, not whether the chauffeur was acting under 

color of office. That would be a distinct inquiry not 

related specifically to whether a person is acting 

under, but that's the third part of this question.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I, I it seems to me 

color of office, you say color of office, it means that 

its appearance to somebody else is that -- that he is 

being an official. And I would think that that requires 

the fact that he's assisting a Government agent in 

enforcing the law against somebody.

 MR. FREDERICK: And in the Medicare context 

this happens. Blue Cross-Blue Shield, hired out by the 

Government to pursuant to a very detailed contract to 

engage in intermediary payments, and audits, forming 

Government functions. I think that is a paradigmatic 

instance where the Government consists -- and has 

ongoing supervisory relationship and a control over the

conduct as it is implementing the Government's function.

 The Government employment example, like 

Soper, where the chauffeur is hired and brought into 

work with the agents, they're having a ongoing 

supervisory relationship, telling him where to drive, 

what to do, where to go. They are able to alter his 

conduct in the same way.

 In many procurement instances, that is not 

true.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: How, how do you 

distinguish your Blue Cross example from the instance 

where drug companies are doing testing required by the 

FDA?

 MR. FREDERICK: That's compliance with the 

regulation. There are all sorts of instances, 

Justice Kennedy, where industry is required to do 

certain things before they can bring their product to 

market. That's not acting --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Blue Cross is different 

because there they are acting as an intermediary of the 

Government?

 MR. FREDERICK: They are performing a 

function at the Government's direction for the 

Government. The Government used to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that doesn't

seem to be a distinction. The drug companies -- the 

Government wants to make sure that drugs are safe and 

effective and so they issue regulations saying here's 

how you have to test it. They're just, you could say, 

delegating the testing to the companies.

 MR. FREDERICK: No. Compliance doesn't 

constitute a delegation, Mr. Chief Justice. And the 

reason is quite clear from the fact that the Code of 

Federal Regulations is full of all sorts of very 

specific instructions to industry actors. But when they 

comply with those rules they are not acting on behalf of 

the Government. They are simply fulfilling a legal 

obligation that all Americans have to fulfill when 

confronted with a question of Federal law.

 The situation for acting under is different, 

and in the Medicaid context, there's a very special 

bureaucracy that has been created under the Secretary of 

Health and Human Services to perform Government 

functions that used to be performed that are now 

contracted out to Blue Cross-Blue Shield, and I 

acknowledge that that is a very different kind of 

situation.

 But the Government, of course, in a 

multi-trillion-dollar budget purchases all sorts of 

items all the time. Many of them are off the shelf.

And others are subject to very specific and detailed 

specifications.

 But the compliance by a contractor with 

specific and detailed instructions would not itself 

transform that entity into a person acting under a 

Federal officer.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's a difference 

between you are providing products and complying with 

testing. In other words, and if, in fact, the 

Government specifies precisely how the testing is 

supposed to be done to determine whether it, the 

Government, will approve the marketing of a particular 

drug, and the challenge, the litigation is to the 

testing. Somebody sues as drugs company and says you 

know, you tested this drug wrong, we think you should 

have tested it some other way, and the drug company says 

the Government told us how to test it -- why in that 

situation aren't they acting under a Government 

official?

 MR. FREDERICK: Because it would be 

transforming a preemption defense into an opportunity to 

use a Federal officer removal to have a case from State 

court to Federal court. This Court has said many times 

that preemption is an issue that can be decided by State 

courts, and the mere fact that someone is complying with

detailed Federal regulations, and therefore is able to 

claim the cause of action is preempted as a result of 

those Federal regulations, does not transform the person 

into a person acting under a Federal officer.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just out of curiosity, 

what, what happens to the, the employees of the private 

companies that run prisons? Could they removed under 

this provision?

 MR. FREDERICK: It depends on the nature of 

the contract, Justice Scalia. The things that the Court 

would look at would depend --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They either run the prison 

for a State, or for the Federal Government.

 MR. FREDERICK: What the Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- or the Federal 

Government.

 MR. FREDERICK: What the Court would look at 

is whether there is a ongoing supervisory relationship 

and whether the Federal officer has the power to 

transform or alter the conduct. If those circumstances 

are met, then there would be a very strong argument that 

the person is acting under the Federal officer.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the prison case, 

there's not any if about it. A State, municipality, has 

a contract with a private entrepreneur to run a prison.

One question that I think must have come up 

in that context comes under the 1983 action in --

against a, a prison guard, a privately hired prison 

guard.

 MR. FREDERICK: Of course, this Court has 

held that in that context there is not State action in 

that particular circumstance. In fact, in the Third 

Circuit, Philip Morris defended its actions against a 

very similar claim regarding its marketing, that it was 

not a State actor for purposes of a Bivens action or a 

Section 1983 claim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the test here? Is 

that the test here? If it is State action, it is 

covered by this statute. If it isn't, it is not?

 MR. FREDERICK: There -- that would 

certainly be a simple way to determine whether a person 

is acting under a Federal officer, if it meets the 

entwinement test articulated by this Court in that case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But suppose it doesn't.

 MR. FREDERICK: If it doesn't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Should I conclude it 

therefore is not covered?

 MR. FREDERICK: No, I think that the proper 

standard, Justice Scalia, as I've said, is whether there 

is a ongoing supervisory relationship and the Government

has the power to alter the actor's conduct. If those 

two conditions are met then a person can be said to be 

acting under the Federal officer within the meaning of 

this statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't follow that. The 

Government is always altering people's conduct when it 

regulates them.

 MR. FREDERICK: But not on a basis that is I 

think appropriate to understand a subordinate 

relationship. The fact that there is alteration through 

Government regulation is simply compliance with law. 

But to be acting under within the meaning of this 

Court's cases -- and I would direct the Court to the 

Greenwood case, which the other side basically 

ignores -- in that case, in footnotes 17 and 20, this 

Court made clear that the phrase "acting under" is 

acting in that kind of subordinate relationship in the 

execution of laws. Compliance is insufficient. 

Otherwise, it would blow the whole statute apart. 

Everybody in a regulated industry would able to remove 

under the Federal officer statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Has it been done? I 

mean, this is -- I don't recall any case like this. Are 

there other product liability cases that are removed 

from State court to Federal Court on a similar basis?

MR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, in our 

cert papers, and we didn't repeat them in our merits 

papers, we give examples where a window blinds 

manufacturer, a medical device manufacturer, a whole 

series of others, a bank, a credit union, have attempted 

-- after the Eighth Circuit's decision in this case have 

removed cases to Federal court on the grounds that they 

are Federal officers because they are subjected to far 

more extensive regulations than Philip Morris.

 In fact, if you turn to volume 16 of the 

Code of Federal Regulations and turn to part 408, 

there's a heading, and it says Deceptive Unfair 

Advertising of Cigarettes For Health Benefits. Then 

underneath it it says "intentionally left blank." And 

the argument that these other entities have made is 

there are no Federal regulations concerning the 

marketing of "light" cigarettes but there are 

regulations concerning our products. So therefore, we 

must be a Federal officer because the regime governing 

us is far more specific and detailed than it is for 

cigarettes.

 If I could reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Frederick.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN, 

ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING PETITIONERS

 MR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court.

 Manufacturers of cars, drugs, medical 

devices, pesticides, home appliances and numerous other 

consumer good market their products in accordance with 

detailed and specific Federal Government regulation.

 If that in a colorable preemption defense 

were sufficient to trigger removal, then it would create 

the potential for a very major shift of traditional 

State law litigation from State to Federal court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do they test their products 

before they're marketed under rigid Federal testing 

regulations which are supervised by the Federal 

Government?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: Let me talk about -- there 

are, there are numerous testing requirements. The 

automobile industry has to test for fuel efficiency; it 

has to test for crash testing under very specific 

requirements. The home appliances have to be tested for 

energy efficiency under Federal requirements --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is the Government 

supervising those?

be, which is what, what is argued is the case here?

compliance with Federal law.

 They are not acting under Federal officers

meaning of this statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- what 

about USDA food inspection? Isn't a lot of that 

delegated to the producers rather than the Government 

officials?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: The Government --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you still get a 

Government stamp.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: You can have different 

situations. And I'm not sure about the precise one 

you're talking about. But you can have situations and 

the FAA is one, where the FAA has a statute which says 

you can delegate to third parties inspecting aircrafts, 

and the Agency certifies through regulation that this 

person is inspecting as a representative of the FAA. 

Now that's a varied situation. In that kind of 

situation the person would acting under. But if the 

person is simply complying with Federal requirements 

about how to test, that is private behavior, acting on 

their own behalf, in order to further the marketing of

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you are a 

federally certified inspector you are acting under --

MR. GORNSTEIN: Certified as a 

representative of the FAA, yes, you are.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about private 

transportation of mail? Is the private contractor who's 

carrying U.S. mail, is that person -- could he remove a 

case under this provision.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: The standard for contracts 

is some contracts are in and some contracts are out in 

our minds, depending on whether the -- they are subject 

to the guidance, supervision, or control of federal 

officers. And so if they are performing a service on 

behalf of the federal government and they are subject to 

control or supervision, then they could be acting under 

federal officers.

 Now the situation here, the test that the 

court of appeals used, simply acting in conformity with 

detailed and specific Federal regulation, is one that 

would lead, as I said, to a very substantial change in 

where State court claims have been litigated up until 

now.

Senate or maybe the Executive Branch, for that matter, 

closely supervises my preparation and service of that 

food. Am I acting under, even though I'm not assisting 

the Government in any governmental function at all? 

Don't you have to be assisting in the performance of a 

governmental function?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: But the problem with that, 

what you're saying, is the 1948 statute expanded it all 

Federal officers. So if Federal officers were running 

that cafeteria, those Federal officers could remove 

because they are performing a duty under Federal law to 

provide that service to Federal employees.

 Now, once the statute expanded out in 1948 

to cover Federal officers who perform any function, not 

just enforcement functions, it carried with it persons 

who act under Federal officers in performing those very 

same functions. So if the Federal Government hired an 

employee to serve food who was acting under a Federal 

officer who was responsible for the delivery of food, 

that person would be acting under a Federal officer 

within the meaning of this statute, assuming that the 

person was subject to the control, guidance, and 

oversight in the delivery of that food.

 Now, this case is very far from the 

historical examples of citizens being called upon by

revenue laws or the chauffeur who was, under a Federal 

employment contract, who then -- assisted revenue 

officers in carrying out a raid on a distillery, or the 

military corporal who was involved in assisting Federal 

officers in making an arrest.

 Those are the historical examples. They 

point to the principle that you are talking about people 

who are in a subordinate position and who are acting on 

behalf of or otherwise assisting Federal officers in 

carrying out their duties.

 As for the alternative ground for affirmance 

here, that is that there has been a delegation, testing 

delegation of authority, there has been no delegation of 

authority. It is unusual for the Government to delegate 

out its own regulatory responsibilities to the very 

industry it is regulating and it didn't do that here. 

What the Government did is that it had at one time its 

own testing program. It eliminated that testing program 

altogether, which had not been required by statute but 

was simply the result of a commission vote. And after 

that, the industry continued to carry on the very 

testing that it had been doing all along as a result of 

an agreement among industry participants. Now, even if

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't care what 

kind of testing they do? They can change the method and 

change the way to resolve --

MR. GORNSTEIN: Actually, the Federal Trade 

Commission cannot require the particular testing method. 

But even if you assume it could, Mr. Chief Justice, that 

would simply be a regulatory condition on the marketing 

of a product. And acting in accordance with a 

regulatory condition on the marketing of a product is 

not acting under a Federal officer, for the reasons I've 

discussed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gornstein, was there 

any Government litigation against the cigarette 

companies?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: There has been Government 

litigation against the cigarette companies for 

allegations that are very similar to the complaint in 

this case except that it is being brought under the RICO 

statute. That litigation is pending in the D.C. Circuit 

and the basic allegation, one of the allegations of the 

complaint, is that the cigarette companies have falsely 

marketed their products as being lest dangerous than 

other products when, in fact, they are not.

there was a delegation of authority here, it would not

 What this complaint says is that these --

that the Respondent here engaged in deceptive

would cheat the test and then marketing the cigarettes

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The heart of this lawsuit is that official 

FTC tar and nicotine ratings generated by testing 

performed by Respondents under the FTC's supervision and 

transmitted to the public in Respondent's advertising at 

the FTC's insistence is misleading; therefore, the 

creation and transmission of the allegedly misleading 

data for which Respondents are being sued were acts 

performed by Respondents to assist the FTC in performing 

its official responsibilities.

regulation saying you've got publish these measurements?

 MR. OLSON: No. The FTC did not do it 

through a regulation. If the Court were to look at 

pages 93 to 110 of the Joint Appendix, you would see 

testimony by the Chairman of the FTC and the head of the 

consumer protection part of the FTC saying: We chose 

not to do it by regulation because we found that it was 

much more efficient, much more fast, and much for 

effective to force the tobacco companies into what is 

called a voluntary agreement requiring precisely that 

information.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if one of the companies 

had said, we're sick of doing this, we don't like the 

numbers we're getting, whatever, we're just not going to 

do it, presumably if we, you know, accept that testimony 

at face value, the FTC would have moved and said, okay, 

I guess we're going to have to have a reg or a statute 

or what-not. During that period of time, the company 

wouldn't be committing any offense?

 MR. OLSON: Yes, it would. In a 1978 

advisory opinion, which is found on pages 202 of the 

joint appendix, the FTC stated categorically -- and the 

joint appendix, by the way, Justice Souter, is full of 

exactly what I'm talking about. The FTC said tar values 

in cigarette advertising must be consistent with the

latest FTC number and stated that it would be deceptive 

to advertise higher numbers or lower numbers or 

different numbers. In other words, the enforcement 

wouldn't be through the enactment of a regulation. The 

FTC -- again, I refer to the testimony of the Chairman 

of the FTC: The FTC does things this way because --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What is this -- I'm just 

not following it. What is the source of the so-called 

"FTC number" to which advertising must conform?

 MR. OLSON: The source of the FTC number is 

the FTC test, alternatively called the Cambridge filter 

test.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The Cambridge test, yes.

 MR. OLSON: But the FTC calls it the FTC 

test. It was devised by the FTC. It has a specific set 

of requirements. The FTC itself performed that test for 

a number of years. Then in 1987 the test was 

transmitted -- the FTC stopped doing it and allowed the 

industry to do it itself because the -- again, in that 

same testimony by the Chairman of the Commission, he 

said that: It will be more effective and easier for us, 

and we can use our funds for other purposes if the 

industry does it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I understand that. But if

we're not going to give any numbers, we're simply going 

to say "Smoke Marlboros," and the FTC wanted numbers and 

they wanted the numbers in accordance with the Cambridge 

testing method, they would then have had to regulate, 

adopt a regulation, or get Congress to pass a statute.

 MR. OLSON: It's fairly -- what happened, 

it's fairly clear from what the FTC has said, they would 

bring an action for deceptive advertising if there was 

anything involved in the marketing of those cigarettes 

that had to do with tar and nicotine levels.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Now, in my hypo they 

just say: Look, we're just going to say "Smoke 

Marlboros." We're not going to say the nicotine is low 

or anything. The FTC would not at that point have any 

basis to charge a violation?

 MR. OLSON: No, they wouldn't. But that is 

not of course this case. This case involves --

JUSTICE SOUTER: All I'm getting at is the 

FTC had no basis other than a voluntary agreement to 

require them to publish any numbers or to publish any 

numbers in accordance with the Cambridge --

MR. OLSON: The history of that is set forth 

in the record and it's clear.

announced a proposed rule. It then sent a letter to the 

tobacco companies saying, it would be much easier for us 

and much easier for you to enter into a voluntary 

agreement. It gave them 30 days to come up with a 

voluntary agreement. They produced an agreement which 

the FTC rejected because it allowed certain flexibility 

with respect to the testing and didn't adhere 

specifically to the FTC test that you're referring to.

 It rejected that first agreement. The 

tobacco companies came back with another agreement. The 

FTC accepted that agreement and said that it would 

enforce the voluntary agreement against the tobacco 

companies and if they deviated from it they'd return to 

the rulemaking process.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Again, you're talking 

about an agency that has set certain standards that the 

entity its regulating must meet. They must meet all 

kinds of requirements for certain kinds of tests by 

OSHA, say, for example. Think of pesticides, think of 

hazardous substance -- quite precise tests that the 

Government says you must make this test before you 

market that dangerous product.

 I don't see how cigarettes are any different 

from hazardous wastes, pesticides, just the vast number 

of potentially dangerous to health products that are

marketed and the Government says: We're not going to 

let you put those things out on the market unless you go 

through a certain testing regimen. That doesn't make 

the party an agent of the Government for the testing 

purposes.

 MR. OLSON: Let me see if I can answer that 

question, Justice Ginsburg. This is not merely 

compliance with the rule. This is not merely testing of 

products. The FTC created the standard. It created the 

testing mechanism. It performed the tests according to 

very detailed criteria. Those tests are now performed 

by the industry for the FTC. Those test results must be 

reported to the FTC. The FTC then reports those results 

to Congress and publishes them in the Federal Register 

as the official FTC tobacco ratings, and then the FTC 

requires --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They are called FTC 

ratings?

 MR. OLSON: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And they are called -- in 

the regulations it's called the FTC test, even after it 

has been done by the companies?

it?

 MR. OLSON: It's not careless. They are 

pronouncing the facts.

 And in a case that you participated in in 

the D.C. Circuit, the brief in that case, the Brown and 

Williamson case that was mentioned before Justice Bork 

wrote the opinion, in that brief I counted -- I stopped 

counting about 10 or 12 times after the words "the FTC 

test methodology," the "FTC official ratings," the FTC 

this, the FTC that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there must be many 

times when an agency prescribes a test that a regulated 

party must comply with. It's still a relationship of a 

regulator, the FTC, sets standards that the regulated 

party has to meet. I just don't see -- it could be 

called "the FTC test," but it's a test for what? Are 

you complying with the law when you're manufacturing and 

marketing this product?

 MR. OLSON: Let me try again, 

Justice Ginsburg. If the FTC had said to four local 

hospitals, please perform this test according to this 

specification for us, the FTC, and then give us these 

results, which we will then publish as the FTC official 

ratings of cigarettes, and then if those hospitals were 

sued because the testing and the results were alleged to

that that case could be removed under the Federal

JUSTICE SOUTER: What if in your hypo the 

Government came along and said, in order to run your 

hospital, you've got to disclose certain facts. 

Otherwise we're going to shut it down. And those facts 

from that point on are like your hypo. Would your 

conclusion then follow, that they were acting under?

 MR. OLSON: No. It would be a vastly 

different situation.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't that the 

situation that we've got here?

 MR. OLSON: The difference, the difference 

is, is that, A, the test is, is -- the FTC and the 

record is full of this, too; the FTC set a goal for 

itself very early in the regulatory process. It wanted 

consumers to purchase lower tar and nicotine cigarettes. 

Now how was it going to accomplish that, the FTC goal? 

It devised this test. It made it official FTC test. 

Official FTC ratings. What this is doing is 

conscripting in a way or accepting here's what the --

be tempted to quit if there was only the heavy kind. 

But to say that, the light cigarettes were forced on the 

cigarette companies by the FTC certainly --

MR. OLSON: Well, in, in 29 -- this is in 

the record. The FTC set forth goals, it's 29 Federal 

Register 530, in -- on January 22, 1964, that the FTC 

described its goal as to encourage the development of 

less hazardous cigarettes. That was done in conjunction 

with a earlier or a contemporaneous -- nearly 

contemporaneous Surgeon General report which is reported 

at joint appendix pages 57 to 60, that the Government 

had as its goal the responsible promotion of cigarettes 

low in tar and nicotine. Now I'm not saying --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, any product that 

the Government supervises, certainly the Government 

would want to promote a safer -- I mean, think of a jet 

ski. Think of -- products are marketed because people 

want them, and off course the Government as supervisor 

will want to encourage a safer product. But let me ask 

you a different question, Mr. Olson.

 The removal area has been really closely 

guarded by Congress. You know it's not easy to get a 

case out of State court and move it to the Federal 

court. In fact, Congress has said if the Federal court 

shifts it back, no matter how wrong a that decision was,

it stays in the State court.

 One can't remove -- you may have a wonderful 

Federal defense, a preemption defense. You can't remove 

on that basis. You may have a counterclaim, so you're 

really the same as a plaintiff. You can't remove on the 

basis of a counterclaim.

 Well, Congress has been so careful to let 

the State courts do State tort litigation. Then we are 

supposed to read into a Federal officer removal statute, 

that kind of, the removal of a State tort case from 

State court to Federal court? Because that's quite the 

fashion.

 MR. OLSON: The Government says that the 

test is -- is, that if an individual, private actor, is 

assisting the Federal Government in performing the 

official Government function, the case is appropriate to 

be removed. That is what the Government says section 

1441(a)(1) means. This Court has said that section 

shall be liberally construed, not narrow or limited in 

its construction, and not frustrated by a narrow, 

grudging interpretation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is this right? If I have 

it -- I'm using sort of a silly example to explain it to 

myself. But I'm thinking the FDA -- or no, the

in red apples not being red. So they say we hire 

thousands of apple lookers, and the apple lookers look 

at all the apples and they devise a redness test which 

is really fabulous, you know, very precise.

 MR. OLSON: The apple lookers' device?

 JUSTICE BREYER: No. The FDA. The FDA has 

the apple looking redness test, and the apple lookers 

apply the test. And if you pass the test, you can say 

red apple, and if you don't pass the test you don't. 

Now I'll give you two different things that happen. One 

day because of budget cuts the FDA hires a lipstick 

company to look, because they're experts on redness; 

they know how to perform a test.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: The other possibility is 

they say to the apple companies, you do your own 

looking. Now I think there'd be the difference that 

you're trying to argue, and I don't think it cuts or 

you. Because in the first case, what they've done is 

hire somebody to perform a governmental function. In 

the second case, what they've done is to the people who 

are regulated and have the interest, in announcing they 

have red apples, they've said, you do it yourself.

why; he said it's better undertaken by private

JUSTICE BREYER: That wouldn't be relevant, 

because the -- the problem with the, with the approach 

that you're taking, as I see it, would be that, that 

there are probably a lot of instances where a regulated 

firm, the regulation meaning yes/no, market/not market; 

yes/no, advertise/not advertise, performs all kinds of 

tests to see if it is yes or no.

 And if you're going to start taking that 

kind of firm and breaking it apart to say whether it's 

doing the testing part or some other part, you're really 

opening the gates.

 MR. OLSON: But we're -- we're not. We're 

suggesting -- you're -- what you're doing in your 

question and your statement is to disaggregate the 

pieces of the process here. Here it is the FTC's goal, 

it's FTC's method; it's the FTC's test which is 

supervised but done by the companies. And then it

becomes the FTC official ratings which they then must 

transmit to the company in their advertising. And now 

they're sued because those ratings that they've done 

according, for the FTC, according to the FTC standards, 

are alleged to be misleading.

 So it's -- it's not possible to disaggregate 

it. It is a whole spectrum; the testing itself and the 

reporting -- is done by the industry because the 

FTC wants it as its official numbers, and it wants its 

official numbers given to the consumers. And it is 

setting an advisory opinion, even if you tell them that 

your cigarettes have higher tar or lower tar, if you 

don't report our numbers, you will be sued for deceptive 

advertising.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So what you are 

saying is that this function is so separable and it is 

so much a FTC function and it is so much like delegating 

it to the third party that did nothing of the testing, 

that even if you delegate it to the second party which 

does testing and then benefits from the testing, that's 

still not enough to take it out.

 MR. OLSON: What I was saying in answer --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that -- have I got that 

right?

 MR. OLSON: I think so. Let me restate it,

because I think I understand what you've said.

 And I think what I was trying to say with 

respect to Justice Ginsburg's question, if the -- all 

those private hospitals did it, I think the Government 

would admit, the Federal -- and then is there an 

exception in the statute? If the regulated entity, in 

this case the tobacco company, does it rather than the 

hospital? And there's nothing in the statute that says 

that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No. But I -- so, so to use 

my silly example, I mean, it is like the lipstick 

company. You're saying, well if they did it to the 

lipstick company it would be clearly that they're the 

Government agent. And it is so technical, so 

governmental, so heavily involved with the Government 

for testing, that even though you give it to the apple 

growers themselves, they are still Government agents 

when they perform it.

 MR. OLSON: The Agency decided they are any 

JUSTICE BREYER: I, I see the argument now.

 MR. OLSON: Yeah.

authority ever, that you found for that?

MR. OLSON: This is, as the Eighth Circuit 

said, a very unusual situation. But the closest 

analogies are, are to the Government contractor cases. 

And by the way, it doesn't require a contract to be 

acting under the supervision. I heard the Government 

say that what you had to have is someone supervised by 

the Government with the Government's power to alter the 

actor's conduct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well there's one 

different. If you're doing it for the Government, the 

Government says we want Agent Orange; we know it's a 

very dangerous substance. So they give you an order; 

we're going to make very precise specifications. But 

you're doing it for us. We, the Government, want that, 

and so we are going to put tight controls on your 

manufacturing it for us.

 A little was different from a commercial 

company going out to sell market goods to the public at 

large?

 MR. OLSON: Justice, I understand there's a 

distinction. Because the Government is the actual 

consumer of that product. But here the Government 

announced that its goals were to accomplish a market in 

lower tar cigarettes. And it said with respect to the 

testing, it's better undertaken by private researchers.

So it was fulfilling the Government's desire to have 

something they could save the money, if they close down 

the laboratory, they said in this testimony, we'll use 

the money for enforcement pumps against the cigarette 

company. We can regulate and determine, fulfill the 

official functions of the Government more effectively, 

more efficiently if we do it this way.

 So it is the Government's objective. It is 

the Government's results they are seeking to obtain. 

And they've conscripted voluntarily the industry to do 

the thing for it and then it calls it its official 

results.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Have, have they imposed its 

official -- has it imposed, the FTC, its official 

results on any company that was not a participant in 

this -- in this testing lab?

 MR. OLSON: I don't know the answer to that. 

I think the answer is no. I think that what, what the 

FTC was able to accomplish at that time was to get every 

-- the major players in the marketplace with respect to 

participation in this. I don't know --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Your case would be stronger 

if they weren't doing it just for themselves. If in 

fact that they were doing it for the FTC who imposed it 

even on somebody else.

MR. OLSON: That's the private hospital

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah.

 MR. OLSON: I don't know that it would be 

stronger. Why would it be weaker --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Because here you're doing 

it for yourself. You want to advertise low -- low --

low tar cases. And the FTC says the only way we'll let 

you do it, the only way we'll let do you that 

advertising is if you test them pursuant to this, this 

system that we established.

 And you say okay. We'll test them pursuant 

to the system you've established and -- and everybody 

goes happily away.

 MR. OLSON: Well, that happens to be --

there happens to be a coincidence of what the Government 

wants to accomplish and what the industry is willing to 

and wants to accomplish. I'll accept that. So does 

that mean there's an exception to the Federal officer 

removal statute, if the person who is asked to help the 

Government, does help the Government, is sued because 

his actions in helping the Government occasioned someone 

to bring a law suit?

the complaint in this case, testing is a small part of 

it. They're complaining about the modification of the 

tobacco blend, the weight, rod length, the 

circumference, use of reconstituted tobacco sheets. In 

other words there's a lot going on here in the complaint 

here besides the testing. And if the Government is in 

no way specifying the tobacco blend, the weight, the 

length, all these other things that are allegedly part 

of the manipulation to affect the figures.

 MR. OLSON: Well, in the first place if 

there's anything in the complaint that allows a removal 

then the case can be removed. That's the Exxon versus 

Allapattah case that the Court decided just a couple of 

terms ago. But secondly, let me address directly what 

you are saying.

 Throughout the complaint, in the complaint 

itself, I found references to the testing machine or 

method eight times in the complaint. They say -- they 

complain about representations that cigarettes contain 

less tar and nicotine than regular cigarettes. They 

base that on the test results. They then say as 

measured by the industry standard testing apparatus.

 And let me refer to what the Petitioners 

said in their motion to remand to the State court. They 

complained -- they said the basis of this complaint is

misleading low tar and nicotine ratings as measured by 

the company's testing procedures. That's in the 

Petitioners' motion to remand. Furthermore, the 

district court interpreted the complaint precisely the 

way we are explaining this to the Court today. The 

district court said that over and over again, words of 

the district court at page 42a of the petition appendix, 

the court concludes that the FTC's regulation of the 

cigarette companies' testing and advertising cuts to the 

heart of the plaintiff's lawsuit.

 Well, the heart of the plaintiff's lawsuit 

is testing and advertising. The testing is required by 

the FTC. The results of the testings are the FTC's 

numbers. And the advertising contains the FTC's numbers 

because the FTC requires it. The circuit court 

interpreted --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the company is doing 

it so it can stay in business and market this product, 

not as a service to the U.S. Government.

 MR. OLSON: I don't deny that the -- the 

Respondents in this case are engaged in industry. A 

regulated industry by the FTC. And that's correct, 

Justice Ginsburg.

 I don't think there's an exception. And the 

Government hasn't suggested there's an exception in the

Federal officer removal statute because someone happens 

to be in the industry which is asked to help the 

Government perform a particular function. There is no 

logic to that, and it certainly would be not a liberal 

interpretation of the Federal officer removal statute.

 The circuit court also said the very -- and 

I think this is worth noting, at page 15a of the 

appendix to the cert petition, the very combination the 

plaintiff challenges as deceptive is the same 

combination the FTC requires not to be -- to put in your 

advertising in order not to be deceptive.

 So what is required by the FTC of the 

plaintiffs, the advertising of these test -- official 

test results -- is precisely what the Petitioners say, 

and the Petitioners say is deceptive. That's the basis 

for their lawsuit.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well that's a good, that's 

a good preemption argument.

 MR. OLSON: If the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure it has much 

bearing upon whether --

MR. OLSON: Well, it is a good preemption 

argument, Justice Scalia. That will be played out 

either in the State court, depending upon how you rule, 

or the Federal court. But it's -- that's the nexus and

the color of Federal authority that you talked about in 

your dissenting opinion in that Acker case.

 The Court in the Acker case, Jefferson 

County versus Acker, said that the allegations in the 

petition and in the removal petition must be -- and 

especially since they weren't challenged in this case, 

the factual allegations and the characterization of the 

complaint were not challenged in this case -- must be 

accepted as true by this Court. And Chief Justice 

Roberts, it's not only the allegations in the complaint 

and the characterization in the removal petition, but 

it's what the district court decided the complaint said.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I know all that's involved 

here is the forum and removal; but if we were to rule 

for you that there' is Federal officer status here, 

would that effect any of the substantive determinations 

on the preemption question, etcetera?

 MR. OLSON: No, I don't think so. I think 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's just a forum 

question?

 MR. OLSON: Yes, it is. And this is an 

appropriate case for evaluation of the conduct of the 

person acting --

Is there anything in the complaint that alleges you 

didn't perform the tests properly?

 MR. OLSON: Yes. Yes. There is. But as I 

said, that is not -- I mean, the part of the complaint, 

as the district court saw it and the circuit court saw 

it, is much more than that. It's the testing and so on 

and so forth. And I don't think it would make any 

difference because even if there's an allegation, which 

there is in the complaint, that the test was manipulated 

or gained or circumvented, it goes back to whether it's 

a good test or not.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand 

your response to Justice Kennedy. If we determine that 

you're acting under the direction of a Federal officer, 

that would seem to me highly pertinent on the merits of 

a preemption argument. So it would not be just the 

forum, but kind of getting into the preemption merits.

 MR. OLSON: Well, it may perhaps be. But 

what, it's an interpretation of the statute. I don't 

think there's any doubt about that anyway, Chief Justice 

Roberts, because it's clear that what was being done 

here is something that the FTC wanted done in the way 

the FTC wanted it done. I don't know how the -- I 

believe that the preemption argument is very, very 

strong, because the lawsuit, the substance, the guts,

the core, the heart of the lawsuit, as the district 

court said and the Eighth Circuit said is, you're doing 

what the FTC required you to do, and the plaintiffs say 

that it's deceptive.

 And by the way, it's very clear from the 

record in the joint appendix and in the district court 

decision and in the remand in the motion -- the motion 

to -- the petition to remove, that the FTC knew exactly 

the deficiencies that are alleged in the complaint.

 The FTC has been aware of the fact that 

people smoke differently, that cigarette -- the design 

of a cigarette may affect the outcome of the test. But 

what the FTC, knowing that full well, said, well, people 

might smoke things differently and you might get more 

tar and nicotine than the FTC ratings produce. And the 

FTC with full awareness said, we understand all that, 

but what we want is for the consumers to have an ability 

to compare this cigarette with this cigarette, and we 

have devised a test that will allow you to compare an 

apple to an apple. Now there are other things that will 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It all comes back to me 

now, that case you mentioned. Lip drape, that was the 

lip drape case, wasn't it, where people smoke

the filter when their lips -- the lip drape. The naked 

lip drape.

 MR. OLSON: That is the case. I don't know 

if you've charactered it the same way I did, but the 

apples to apples thing is tied in with your 

hypothetical, Justice Breyer, about the apple 

inspectors.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is it the apple institute 

who's doing the testing?

 MR. OLSON: It's the Tobacco Institute 

testing facility --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I said apple institute. 

You know, that seemed to me to be the case where it was 

the apple institute or whatever it was that was the 

delegate, and then they applied the test, and the people 

they were applying the test to weren't.

 MR. OLSON: It's a facility of the tobacco 

industry. The FTC perceives it as -- these industries 

-- and these companies, and as I said, even the 

petitioners in their remand petition are challenging the 

low tar and nicotine rate measured by the company's 

testing procedures. So yes, I'd like to have it be 

something different but it isn't something different. 

It is what the companies have done, and through this 

mechanism.

This case comes down to the fact that the 

FTC wanted certain things done. It decided how certain 

things would be done. It calls the results of those the 

official FTC ratings. It wants those ratings delivered 

to the people. And the tobacco companies have done that 

and they're being sued because they say -- because that 

information which they're delivering, that they're 

creating and delivering at the request of the 

Government, is alleged to be deceptive. This is the 

perfect case for a removal under the federal officer 

removal statute.

reason, Justice Scalia. For decades, the cigarette 

companies were rightly perceived as deceiving the public 

about the health content of their products.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now the FTC told us 

why they did it. They did it because they could save 

the money by having the industry do it rather than them 

doing it.

 MR. FREDERICK: They also said, Mr. Chief 

Justice, that they expected the companies to police each 

other, which is exactly what happened when the Barclay 

cigarette came up. Philip Morris was the one that 

complained and said that cigarette doesn't comply, it's 

been manipulating the FTC Cambridge filter method. So 

the FTC found a cheaper way to do regulation.

a Federal officer. Thank you.
