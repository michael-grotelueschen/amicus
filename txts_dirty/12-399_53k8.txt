3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 12-399, Adoptive 

Couple v. Baby Girl. 

6  Ms. Blatt? 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

11  All parties agree that even if the birth 

12 father is a parent under the Indian Child Welfare Act, 

13 the State court decision below awarding custody to the 

14 father must nonetheless be reversed unless Sections 

1912(d) or (f) create custodial rights that the father 

16 concededly does not have under State law. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you suggesting -- I 

18 don't know that the parties -- I know that the 

19 government has said that (f) doesn't apply to the 

father, but (d) does, so there's not a full concession 

21 on your point. But putting that aside, if it is a 

22 father who has visitation rights, and exercising all of 

23 his support obligations, is it your position that --

24 that because that father's not a custodian, he has no 

protections whatsoever under (d) or (e)?

1  The State can come and take the child away 

2 from an unfit mother or father if they're the ones with 

3 custody, and that responsible parent who only has 

4 visiting rights has no protections under (d), (e), or 

(f)? 

6  MS. BLATT: Well, under State law --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not asking about 

8 State law --

9  MS. BLATT: Right. I think that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I'm asking about 

11 Federal law. 

12  MS. BLATT: Yes, Federal law, which 

13 requires custodial rights, would protect a father who 

14 has visitation, i.e., custodial rights under State law. 

So in other words, that -- that is to say, 

16 if a father --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, (d) doesn't talk 

18 about custodial rights. I do agree that (f) talks about 

19 continued --

MS. BLATT: Right. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- custody. 

22  MS. BLATT: Okay. So let's talk about (d) 

23 because I think we are in agreement that the Respondents 

24 would have to agree that they either need to win under 

(d) or (f), and we can talk about Section 1915, but

1 that's not a basis for father. 

2  But section (d) -- and I'm reading from the 

3 blue brief at 8a says that it requires the party seeking 

4 the termination of parental rights to provide, quote, 

"remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed 

6 to prevent the breakup of the Indian family." 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you don't think 

8 that a parent with custody -- well, you do think a 

9 parent with custody is the only definition of family, 

but why wouldn't a noncustodial parent with visitation 

11 rights be considered a family with that child? 

12  MS. BLATT: My understanding under State 

13 law, a parent who --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not going to State 

law --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could -- could I 

17 hear her answer, please? 

18  MS. BLATT: Yes. 

19  So the answer is, a parent with visitation 

rights has custody, so he's protected. 

21  Under State law, if you're paying child 

22 support and you bring a paternity action and sue for 

23 visitation rights, that's a petition for custody. So 

24 all a birth dad needs to do to protect himself is to 

acquire legal rights.

1  This father had no legal rights whatsoever, 

2 parental or custodial, and the word "breakup," even the 

3 other side concedes, it's discontinuance of an existing 

4 legal relationship. There was no legal relationship 

between this child and the birth father or his 

6 relatives. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there is a support 

8 obligation on that unwed father. 

9  MS. BLATT: No. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't that a 

11 parental right? It's one of the parental rights the 

12 States enforce whether or not you want to provide 

13 support or not. 

14  MS. BLATT: If a child is being adopted, by 

definition, the -- the adoptive family would be 

16 providing support. But let's take the -- let's take 

17 what a -- again, the definition of breakup. There is no 

18 familial legal custodial parental relationship that 

19 either this father or the -- or his parents -- his 

extended family had with this child. 

21  This adoption no more broke up an Indian 

22 family than his -- than this Hispanic sole custodial 

23 birth mother had raised the child herself. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do you do with 

the States that do give unwed fathers the -- that don't 

7

1 support their children and who don't have an ongoing 

2 relationship the right to be considered first for 

3 adoption? Why should we follow the definitions of South 

4 Carolina or those other States? Why shouldn't we just 

give it a Federal meaning? 

6  MS. BLATT: Because there's --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As --

8  MS. BLATT: Because there's nothing in this 

9 Act that anyone can point to that was a basis for 

transferring custody to this father. At most, there is 

11 an obligation, an exhaustion obligation, that if a 

12 custodial parent has something like a drug abuse problem 

13 the State has to remediate before the family is broken 

14 up. 

What is so extraordinary about this case, 

16 particularly the United States' position, is that the 

17 adoptive parents' failure to remediate a dad meant that 

18 the child got custody of the dad. So if this dad had 

19 had a drug problem because there was no treatment of him 

the court held, well, that's a basis for giving the dad 

21 custody. 

22  But there's no language in the statute that 

23 even remotely suggests that it's a rights-creating 

24 provision. All of both of (d), (e), and (f) are 

protections that assume existing rights and then make it

1 harder to terminate those rights. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Your -- your argument 

3 assumes that the phrase in the statute "to prevent the 

4 breakup of the Indian family" only applies where --

where the father has custody. I don't -- I don't know 

6 why that should be true. If -- if that's what Congress 

7 meant, they could have put it much more narrowly. They 

8 had a very broad phrase, "to prevent the break up of an 

9 Indian family." And this guy is -- is the father of the 

child --

11  MS. BLATT: So he --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and they're taking the 

13 child away from him even though he wants it. 

14  MS. BLATT: Okay. But when you --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that -- that is not the 

16 breakup of -- of an Indian family? 

17  MS. BLATT: The only relationship the dad 

18 had is one of biology. And, Justice Scalia, you cannot 

19 logically break up that biological relationship, nor can 

you provide remedial services to prevent the breakup of 

21 that biological relationship. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see. You're 

23 reading -- you're reading "Indian family" to mean 

24 something more than -- than a biological relationship, 

right? You're going to hang a lot of -- a lot of other

1 ornaments on that phrase? 

2  MS. BLATT: Well, I'm hanging -- I'm hanging 

3 a lot on two things. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it seems to me he's 

the father, the other woman's the mother, that's the --

6 that's the Indian family, the father, the mother, and 

7 the kid. 

8  MS. BLATT: He has a biological link that 

9 under State law was equivalent to a sperm donor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: He's the father. He's the 

11 father. 

12  MS. BLATT: And so is a sperm donor under 

13 your definition. He's a biological father and nothing 

14 else in the eyes of State law. And under that view --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This isn't State law. This 

16 is a Federal statute which uses an expansive phrase, 

17 "the breakup of the Indian family." 

18  MS. BLATT: Right. And there is no Indian 

19 family here. The only breakup --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the difference 

21 with a sperm donor? I mean, I know that you raise that 

22 in your brief. But going back to Justice Scalia's 

23 point, if the choice is between a mother, a biological 

24 father, or a stranger, and if the father's fit, why do 

you think that the Federal statute requires that it be 

10

1 given to a stranger rather than to the biological father 

2 when the statute defines "parent" as the biological 

3 father? 

4  MS. BLATT: And assuming all biological 

fathers that are acknowledged or established are swept 

6 in, which would include any biological father, the only 

7 stranger in this case was the birth father, who 

8 expressly repudiated all parental rights and had no 

9 custodial rights. So again, the problem the other side 

has --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he didn't. I mean, 

12 he -- he said that he was prepared to surrender rights 

13 to the mother, but not to a stranger. And when the 

14 issue of adoption came up, he said, "Yes, I want to 

assert my parental rights." 

16  MS. BLATT: It was too late. There's not a 

17 single State law that lets a dad, birth dad, hold that 

18 kind of veto power over a woman. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does it -- where is 

there a reference in the definition of "parent" to a 

21 State law? I see the -- which is the section that 

22 defines a parent? 

23  MS. BLATT: Section 1903(9). But even 

24 assuming -- which is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

Official 

1  MS. BLATT: -- on page 4A. Whether it's a 

2 Federal definition or a State law definition, I think 

3 everyone agrees you've got to at least look at some sort 

4 of State law. But even if it's just a bare fact of 

paternity, meaning a biological link is established, 

6 they still have to have a basis for an extraordinary 

7 award of a transfer of custody when there's been no best 

8 interest determination and you have a dad who's a 

9 complete stranger with no -- no parental rights 

whatsoever. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It says a parent means a 

12 biological parent of an Indian child and he fits that 

13 definition. And then the next section -- the next 

14 sentence doesn't have any reference to State law. 

MS. BLATT: That's right. And again, 

16 assuming he is a parent -- they -- they need to win both 

17 points, Justice Ginsburg. He needs to be a parent. 

18  Now, if you're an ICWA parent, which means 

19 if you want to accept this definition of "all 

biological," you do have rights under the Federal Act of 

21 getting notice and a right to counsel, and the tribe 

22 would have a right to intervene. The question is, is 

23 there a basis for transferring custody under (d) or (f). 

24 (F) is the one that requires continuing custody. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Ms. Blatt, if he's a

1 parent, why wouldn't some provision in 1912 give him 

2 some rights? In other words, what's the point of making 

3 him a parent under that definitional section if he 

4 doesn't get any of the protections that 1912 provides 

for when to terminate rights? 

6  MS. BLATT: Because this -- this Act is not 

7 about creating rights that didn't otherwise exist. It's 

8 about protecting rights and making it harder to 

9 terminate rights that already exist. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But what's the point of 

11 labeling a parent if he gets no parental rights 

12 under the statute and if the termination provisions 

13 don't apply to him? 

14  MS. BLATT: Notice, right to counsel, and 

heightened consent requirements. So the mother here, 

16 the birth mother is a parent, so she had a right to 

17 notice, right to counsel, and heightened consent 

18 requirements. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: But what is he supposed 

to --

21  MS. BLATT: So those are very significant. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how are they 

23 significant? I mean, I'm trying to understand this 

24 because if you get notice, but then you have nothing to 

say in the proceeding because the statute gives you no

1 rights and the statute doesn't provide any standards for 

2 terminating those rights --

3  MS. BLATT: Right. 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- what are you supposed to 

do once you get notice? 

6  MS. BLATT: Justice Kagan, just because he's 

7 in the door as a parent, that doesn't mean the statute 

8 let him leave out the back door with the child when 

9 there was no, no determination with respect to -- I 

mean, any kind -- it would be unprecedented to think 

11 that because you had a failure to remediate to prevent 

12 the breakup of an Indian family, that's a basis for 

13 awarding custody? And that's the United States' view, 

14 which is --

JUSTICE KAGAN: I think you're not answering 

16 the question of what's the point of labeling him a 

17 parent if he gets none of the protections that the Act 

18 provides to a parent? 

19  MS. BLATT: You're assuming that this entire 

Act was to make sure unwed dads who are Indian got more 

21 time than non-Indian dads to veto adoptions, and that 

22 had -- that's not even remotely the purpose of this. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, wait, wait, wait. 

24 Isn't your answer 1915(a) still applies?

considerable right. 

6  MS. BLATT: Well, 19 --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, they'll have to go 

8 through a set and decide. They have to give it to him 

9 unless -- unless something overcomes the preference or 

there is good cause to the contrary. 

11  MS. BLATT: He's not -- he didn't seek to 

12 adopt the child and he's not one of the preferred 

13 parties. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you're thinking about 

this case. I'm thinking in general. I think the 

16 question --

17  MS. BLATT: Well, no -- no father is a 

18 preferred party under 1915. No father can -- can assert 

19 1915. That is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But doesn't 1915 preclude 

21 the adoptive parents because they're not in the preferred 

22 category? If 1915(a) precludes the adoption, then the 

23 adoptive parents would have no legal basis for objecting 

24 to an award to the father. 

MS. BLATT: Right. Well, we have three 

15

Official 

1 responses. First, we -- that provision assumes that 


2 somebody actually in that -- in that statute stepped up 


3 to adopt the child, and no one did here. 


4  Second, it would raise grave constitutional 


concerns. I mean, just look at (a)(3) on the other 

6 Indian families if Congress presumptively presumed that 

7 a non-Indian parent was unfit to raise any child with 

8 any amount of Indian blood. And so it would either have 

9 to -- it's either not implicated here or resolved by good 

cause. Otherwise, you do have an extraordinary reading, 

11 Justice Ginsburg, of a statute that would override a 

12 birth mother's right to choose the adoptive parents for 

13 her child. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it your position 

that the preference is absolute or is it simply a factor 

16 to be considered with the other -- in other words, if 

17 every other factor suggests that the best interests of 

18 the child are served by placement with the adoptive 

19 couple, does the preference under 1915(a) trump all 

those other interests? 

21  MS. BLATT: It's not our view. Our view is 

22 you would have -- you absolutely would have had good 

23 cause with -- here when you had the 27 months and also 

24 the mother's choice. The tribe's position is that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not listed under

1 the -- there are guidelines for what constitutes good 

2 cause. 

3  MS. BLATT: The best interests of the child 

4 is not listed under the government's guidelines, which 

again is extraordinary. It's also extraordinary that 

6 any other adopt -- any other Indian would get a 

7 preference whether or not that Indian had the same 

8 tribal member. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: In -- in your view, at 

what point, at what date did the Indian father lose the 

11 right to ask for custody? Because he changed his mind 

12 in -- in January, there was about a 5-day period there. 

13  MS. BLATT: Yeah. 

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: The adoption proceedings 

had not concluded. 

16  MS. BLATT: Right. 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And at this point he said, 

18 in effect, I've changed my mind. 

19  MS. BLATT: So State law is you have to 

support the mother during pregnancy or at birth. So the 

21 cases are pretty clear that the father can't wait till 

22 he learns of the adoption. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the State law 

24 determines when his rights under the Federal Act end? 

MS. BLATT: No. State law determines just

1 when you have parental rights to begin with. So its 

2 there's no question that this particular dad, had State 

3 law applied, the adoption would have gone forward and 

4 his rights would have been terminated by virtue of his 

lack of a right to -- to object to the adoption. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless we believe that the 

7 Federal statute determines when he has parental rights 

8 by defining "parent" to include a biological father. 

9  MS. BLATT: Yes, but you still have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's the case, then 

11 what you said doesn't apply. 

12  MS. BLATT: -- custodial rights, though. 

13 That's not a basis for granting him custodial rights. 

14 This -- again, the -- we can talk about (f), but I think 

(f) is pretty obvious that that assumes 

16 preexisting custody to be continued. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I wanted you to talk 

18 about (f). Are you going to say something about that 

19 or --

MS. BLATT: Yes, and I do --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- are you going to leave 

22 it to the government? 

23  MS. BLATT: No. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't agree with the 

government's position, do you?

Official 

1  MS. BLATT: Well, the government agrees with 

2 us on (f). But if you read (d), by the way, it is 

3 inextricably intertwined with (e) and (f). It's talking 

4 about the breakup of a removal proceeding under (f) or a 

foster care proceeding under (e), and the government 

6 concedes that neither of those provisions create rights; 

7 they just make it harder to terminate the custodial 

8 rights of a parent who has custody that can be 

9 continued. 

The other side doesn't really have a 

11 definition of "custody" or "continue" that would sweep 

12 in a dad without any parental rights. And I do just 

13 want to say in terms of looking, taking one step back. 

14 This is not the case that Congress had in mind when it 

passed the Act to halt the depletion of the tribal 

16 population. This involves accretion and conscripting 

17 other people's children to grow the tribal population 

18 based solely on a biological link. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Blatt, continuing on the 

assumption that this man is a parent under the statutory 

21 definition, what your argument seems to be suggesting is 

22 that there are really two classes of parents under the 

23 statute, right, that everybody is labeled a parent, but 

24 then there are the parents who get the protections of --

of the termination of rights provision and the parents

2  And I'm just wondering why if this statute 

3 creates two classes of parents it didn't say that in a 

4 more upfront kind of way? 

MS. BLATT: Yes. 

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: It seems a strange thing to 

7 read into a statute in this sort of backhanded way that 

8 there are really two kinds of parents. 

9  MS. BLATT: Well, I think it's rather 

completely upside down that this entire statute, with 20 

11 or 24 references to removal, custody, return of child to 

12 the parent, is somehow being read to create rights.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

23  MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

But for the application of ICWA, two things

1 would be crystal clear: The birth father would have 

2 absolutely no parental or custodial rights under State 

3 law or the Constitution; and second, the baby girl would 

4 be entitled to a custodial determination that focused on 

her best interests. 

6  Now, the lower courts --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do you do with the 

8 lower court's determination that one of the factors of 

9 the best interest calculus was the Federal policy to 

ensure that Indian children, children of biological 

11 Indian parents, at least one, should be raised with 

12 their parents? Because the lower court said it thought 

13 it was in the best interest of this child to stay with 

14 its birth father, in light of the Federal policy. So I 

disagree with your colleague that there wasn't a best 

16 interest --

17  MR. CLEMENT: Justice Sotomayor, would that 

18 it were true that the Federal preference was one factor 

19 in a multifactor test that looked at this child in her 

best interest. That did not happen here. And if you 

21 have any doubt about that, look at page 40a of the 

22 petition appendix. And what the lower court --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do I do with the 

24 lower court's finding that this father, despite not 

being married to his prior lover, had children, was

2 the child? What do we with -- why are you --

3  MR. CLEMENT: What you do with that, Justice 

4 Sotomayor, is you look what context those findings were 

made. Those findings were made in the context of 

6 1912(f), and the court specifically said that for those 

7 purposes all I can look at is the birth father and 

8 whether this new custodial relationship, beyond a 

9 reasonable doubt, would pose a serious harm to the girl. 

And what he --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But they looked at 

12 something else that everybody's ignoring --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Please finish. Let's 

14 finish. 

MR. CLEMENT: What the court specifically 

16 said is they looked at the expert testimony of how it 

17 would cause trauma, despair, anxiety, depression on this 

18 baby girl to be taken from her parents, and the court 

19 specifically said all of that was legally irrelevant 

because 1912(f) only lets you look at the harm from the 

21 new custodial relationship. It doesn't let you look at 

22 any harm from the breakup of the previous custodial 

23 relationship. 

24  And all of that would make sense if you were 

talking about 912(f)'s application to the situations

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, and even in that 


3 sense, serious emotional and physical damage is a much 


4 different threshold than the best interests of the 


child, even on the statutory terms. 


6  MR. CLEMENT: It's miles away. And it's the 


7 appropriate standard when you're taking somebody who has 


8 existing legal custody and depriving them of it. But 


9 everywhere in the law, including ICWA, when you make an 


initial placement of a child in a new custodial setting, 

11 you don't do that unless you look at the child's best 

12 interest. 

13  And look at 1916(a) of ICWA, which is the only 

14 provision in the Act that specifically contemplates a 

child being placed in a new custodial setting. It talks 

16 about what happens if you have an adoption and then the 

17 adoptive parents for some reason terminate their rights 

18 and then you send the child back to their original 

19 Indian custodian. And in that situation, recognizing 

that when there's been a break of custody, you don't 

21 just send somebody off to a -- a new setting based on 

22 beyond a reasonable doubt; you look at the best 

23 interests of the child. And that's --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Clement, can I go 

back to that best interest calculus? There's two

Official 

1 timeframes in my mind to look at: In January, when he 

2 asserted his parental rights and 2 years later when the 

3 trial was heard. If there's serious emotional harm, I 

4 think the court below said, we're not looking at what 

happens at the time we're deciding the custody issue 

6 because otherwise, we're going to give custody by 

7 estoppel. 

8  We're going to encourage people to hold on 

9 to kids and create the serious physical harm. In 

January, when he asserted his rights, that's what we're 

11 looking at. What was in the best interests of the child 

12 at the time the issue was raised, and that was 4 or 5 

13 months after the birth of the child. 

14  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I'm 

here representing the guardian who represents the best 

16 interest of the child. From the child's perspective, 

17 the child really doesn't care whose fault it was when 

18 they were brought in one custodial situation or another. 

19  They just want a determination that focuses 

on at the relevant time, that time, what's in their best 

21 interest. And so in the same way that we think if you 

22 rule in our favor and you remand to the lower court that 

23 there has to be a best interest determination that takes 

24 into account the current situation, notwithstanding that 

that would be on the hypothesis that the last 15 months

1 of custody were based on a legal misunderstanding, we 

2 still think this girl --

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So we're going to freeze 

4 it at that point or are we going to freeze it today, 

after the child's been with his -- with her father for 2 

6 years? 

7  MR. CLEMENT: You freeze it at the time that 

8 somebody's talking about --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't want to be that 

judge, by the way. 

11  MR. CLEMENT: You freeze it at the time that 

12 somebody's talking about changing a custodial situation. 

13 But what is so tragic here is that the lower court 

14 applied 1912(d) and (f), which are clearly designed for 

a situation when you're contemplating transferring 

16 custody away from an existing custodial relationship. 

17 They looked at that and applied those inapposite 

18 standards to create a transfer to somebody with new 

19 custody. 

Now, the Solicitor --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about now, when you 

22 said the best interest. Now the child has been some 

23 15 months with the father. So if a best interest 

24 calculus is made now, you would have to take into 

account uprooting that relationship, would you not?

1  MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg. 

2 We're not here to try to say that anybody is entitled to 

3 automatic custody of this child based on some legal 

4 rule. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- and I take it 

6 you'll say that that goes back to this South Carolina 

7 court if you prevail? 

8  MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely. And I would hope 

9 with instructions to please make that determination as 

quickly as humanly possible. 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the best interest of 

12 the child is the uniformly accepted standard in State 

13 courts, and if we forget constitutional avoidance 

14 problems which I -- I think exist here, is there 

anything in the statute that allows us to import the 

16 best interests of the child into the statutory language, 

17 or do we have to just rely on constitutional avoidance 

18 and -- and really rewrite the statute? 

19  MR. CLEMENT: Well, a couple of things, 

Justice Kennedy. If you got to the point of applying 

21 1915(a) and the placement preferences -- and we agree 

22 with Petitioners that they're not squarely applicable 

23 here because the birth father's argument was not that I 

24 get to adopt, but that I have an entitlement -- if you 

got to that, I think the good cause standard gives you a 

26

1 vehicle for importing a lot of best interest standards. 

2  I also think you could look --

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though -- even 

4 though the guidelines to what's good cause do not 

include best interest. 


6  MR. CLEMENT: That's right, but even the 


7 Justice Department doesn't say that the guidelines are 


8 binding or entitled to anything more than Skidmore 


9 deference, and I'd take constitutional avoidance over 


Skidmore deference any day. 

11  But the second thing I would put on the 

12 table is I think the fact that 1916(a) tells you that 

13 the one time you are thinking about transferring 

14 custody, Congress looked to the best interest standard. 

That's a clear hint that if you are talking about 

16 transferring custody you should look to the best 

17 interests. 

18  And, again, I think it's imperative to look 

19 at 1912(d), (e), and (f). As the government and the 

Solicitor General recognizes, they all contemplate 

21 continued custody, (e) and (f) do. 

22  Now, then the government turns around and 

23 says, well, but (d) was a basis for what the lower court 

24 did, which is to transfer custody. With all due respect 

to the government, (d) makes even less sense as a basis 

27

1 for transferring custody than (f). At least (f) has 

2 some standard designed for some transfer of custody. It 

3 happens to be the wrong transfer. It's the transfer 

4 away from continuing custody out and it's beyond a 

reasonable doubt. 

6  But (d) has no standard to satisfy. And 

7 their position is that because this birth father was not 

8 presented with remedial and rehabilitative services, 

9 therefore, because he didn't get remedial services that 

presumably he needed, he gets the child. That's crazy. 

11  And what it shows is that 12(d) assumes that 

12 it's like an exhaustion requirement, and unless and 

13 until these services are provided you preserve the 

14 status quo ante. But the lower court didn't preserve 

the status quo ante. The lower court ordered this poor 

16 girl sent to somebody who, at least under state law and 

17 just a matter of practicality, is a stranger to her. 

18  And nowhere in the law do you see any child 

19 being transferred to a new custodial arrangement without 

a best interest determination. And why did it happen 

21 here? It happened here because of ICWA, which by its 

22 terms does not apply to these situations, and it 

23 happened because of 3/256ths of Cherokee blood. 

24  Now, the Justice Department back in 1978 

recognized there were profound constitutional problems

1 with the statute. Then-Assistant Assistant Attorney 

2 General, later Judge, Patricia Wald, told Congress that 

3 there were applications of the statute that raised equal 

4 protection problems because they treated people 

differently solely on the basis of race. 

6  One of the things she pointed to is what she 

7 point -- described as "the (b) portion of the definition 

8 of 'Indian child.'" And that's what makes this child an 

9 Indian child here, its biology, its biology combined 

with the fact that the tribe, based on a racial 

11 classification, thinks that somebody with 325 --

12 1 percent Indian blood is enough to make them a 

13 tribal -- a tribal member, eligible for tribal 

14 membership. 

And as a result of that, her whole world 

16 changes and this whole inquiry changes. It goes from an 

17 inquiry focused on her best interests and it changes to 

18 a focus on the birth father and whether or not beyond a 

19 reasonable doubt there is a clear and present danger. 

Again, that is --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: So what do we do about 

22 that? 

23  MR. CLEMENT: You correct the lower court.

6 parent in the statute, it only makes sense to prove 

7 something more than bare paternity. 

8  Or you could do it by recognizing that if 

9 somebody gets in the front door of this statute based on 

bare paternity, you have to interpret provisions like 

11 (d), (e), and (f) with sensitivity to the fact that 

12 under that reading just because you are a parent doesn't 

13 mean you have these kind of extraordinary rights.

19 and may it please the Court: 

It is simply false to say that this child's 

21 custody was transferred without a best interest 

22 determination, as is apparent from any reading of the 

23 lower court decisions in this case. 

24  Both of the State courts here looked very 

closely at the situation here and they found, in their

1 words, that the father here was a "fit, devoted, and 


2 loving father," and they said expressly and found 


3 expressly as a factual matter that it was in the best 


4 interest of this child. 


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that's 

6 correct under the Act? Where in the Act does it say 

7 that you need to consider whether or not the father is 

8 a -- would be a good parent? I thought your reading was 

9 that it doesn't matter, all that matters is that he has 

in his case 3/128ths Cherokee blood. 

11  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I think that there 

12 is some confusion as to exactly what the State courts 

13 did here and what ICWA does. ICWA does not assign 

14 custody. ICWA -- ICWA addresses the question whether or 

not the parental rights of -- of a parent of an Indian 

16 child can be terminated. The courts here, both courts, 

17 correctly held that under the plain application of ICWA, 

18 under Section 1912(d), as discussed by Justices 

19 Sotomayor and Scalia, clearly parental rights could not 

be terminated. 

21  The question then arose, what happens to the 

22 child? And the court then, because there were a natural 

23 parent with intact parental rights, applied the usual 

24 rule that there is a strong presumption that a fit 

parent, natural parent, who wants to exercise custody

6 is irrelevant? I don't understand your argument. 

7  MR. ROTHFELD: No, no, Your Honor. I -- I 

8 think that the analysis of the South Carolina Supreme 

9 Court was exactly right in this -- in -- in those terms. 

The court applied ICWA, the Federal statute. The 

11 question was, could the parental rights of this parent 

12 be terminated? This -- everyone concedes this is an 

13 Indian child. ICWA applies because of that. 

14  The question then is, can the parental 

rights be terminated? Sections 1912(e) and (f) address 

16 that question -- (d), (e), and (f). And --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you apply a "best 

18 interest of the child" standard to a termination of 

19 parental rights? 

MR. ROTHFELD: No, not in the --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, can -- can -- I 

22 know a lot of kids that would be better off with 

23 different parents.

(f) apply, in your opinion, to this case or not? 


6  MR. ROTHFELD: Yes, it -- in our opinion, 


7 both (d) and (f) apply. 


8  JUSTICE BREYER: And (f) has something of 


9 the best interest standard tilted towards the Indian 


parent.

MR. ROTHFELD: I think that that's right, 

16 but I -- but I would add the -- the caveat that it's not 

17 a best interest in the sense of we are going to apply 

18 this standard to determine custody. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: So in your view the best 

interest standard does not apply, but rather (f) 

21 applies?

Official 

1  MR. ROTHFELD: Correct, but with this 

2 addition, what it applies for is the question whether or 

3 not the rights of this parent can be terminated. 

4 Whether the parental rights of the parent can be 

terminated. And so --

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how does (f) apply? 

7 It says "continued custody." That seems to assume that 

8 custody exists. 

9  MR. ROTHFELD: That is -- that is the other 

side's argument. Our response is that there is a 

11 definitional provision in ICWA that says that a child 

12 custody proceeding is one that includes a proceeding 

13 leading to the termination of parental rights. Parental 

14 rights are defined to be broadly as the parent-child 

relationship. 

16  And so we think in context (f) means that 

17 it's the termination of the parent-child relationship is 

18 what has to be considered. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: So your argument is not that 

"continued" means something different from the normal 

21 language, your argument is that "custody" means 

22 something different from its normal language. 

23  MR. ROTHFELD: Our argument is that 

24 "custody" means what Congress said "child custody 

proceeding" means, which is termination of the

1 parent-child relationship. And so we think that 

2 continuation of a relationship -- the question is under 

3 (f) would that be harmful for the child? But I should 

4 quickly say that (f) is only one part of the argument 

here. As Justices Sotomayor and Scalia began the 

6 discussion with Ms. Blatt, (d) also applies. (D) says 

7 nothing at all about custody. The question under --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could -- could I go 

9 back to what you just said about (f)? You think custody 

covers someone who has never had custody of the child 

11 because it refers to something beyond the accepted 

12 definition? 

13  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- again, the 

14 definition of "child custody proceeding" in ICWA 

includes a proceeding leading to the termination of 

16 parental rights. Parental rights --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But (f) doesn't say 

18 "child custody proceeding." It says "continued custody 

19 of the child." 

MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that's true, but I 

21 think that has to be interpreted within the context of 

22 the definitional provision and what Congress had in mind 

23 when it referred to child custody proceeding. 

24  But I think -- you know, (f), as I say, is 

only a portion of the argument here. And to return to

8 or may not be higher than other States. 

9  I mean, in -- in -- some States may have

But I think -- I think the crucial point is

17 parental rights under -- under (f) is whether or not, as 

18 Justice Scalia says, the rights of a biological parent 

19 can be terminated, which is not sort of the ordinary 

best interest determination when you're choosing between 

21 two people who are strangers to the child. So --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is not -- (f) 

23 is not about terminating parental rights. It's about 

24 what -- I mean, it's about custody, right?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In what proceeding, 

6 the adoption proceeding or custody determination? 

7  MR. ROTHFELD: Any proceeding which is aimed 

8 at the termination of parental rights. The adoption 

9 proceeding here cannot go forward, all concede, unless 

parental rights are terminated. And so if parental 

11 rights cannot be terminated under either (d) or (f), 

12 this adoption cannot go forward and we are in a 

13 different place. 

14  I think that's what -- exactly what the 

South Carolina Supreme Court said. It said, we're going 

16 to apply -- we're going to look to ICWA to see can we 

17 terminate the parental rights of this natural father. 

18 And as Justice Scalia says, that is central. There is a 

19 natural parent here who wants custody. Can his -- can 

his claim for custody be denied and can his parental 

21 rights be terminated? 

22  To determine that, Congress has put Federal 

23 standards in place in ICWA, in (d) and (f), and we have 

24 to say both of those have been satisfied here.

1 An Indian child is someone who is either a member of a 


2 tribe or eligible, and is the biological child of a 


3 member of an Indian tribe. 


4  MR. ROTHFELD: That is correct. 


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So return to what is 

6 a hypothetical question and not what the statute 

7 provides. Under your argument, a tribe that did not 

8 require any blood requirement, but simply enrollment, 

9 could be considered an Indian child. 

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, the -- the child would 

11 have to be a -- would have to be biological parents --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, yes, you have 

13 somebody who has no Indian blood, he enrolls in my 

14 hypothetical tribe, has a biological child. That child 

would be an Indian child and the father would be 

16 entitled to the protections you're arguing for. 

17  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that's -- that's true 

18 in theory. But of course, A, that is not our case. B, 

19 if that were to occur and whether or not that would be 

sort of a legitimate basis for determining membership of 

21 a -- in an Indian tribe I think would be --

22  JUSTICE BREYER: But that is a problem. 

23 Because, look, I mean, as it appears in this case is he 

24 had three Cherokee ancestors at the time of George 

Washington's father. All right? Now, you say, oh,

1 well, that's a different issue. 

2  But I don't see how to decide that case 

3 without thinking about this issue because if your view 

4 is taken and you accept that definition, a - a woman who 

is a rape victim who has never seen the father could, 

6 would, in fact, be at risk under this statute that the 

7 child would be taken and given to the father who has 

8 never seen it and probably just got out of prison, all 

9 right? And you don't know that this beyond reasonable 

doubt standard would satisfy that. 

11  Now, that's obviously something I find 

12 disturbing, as a person and also as a judge, because 

13 we're trying to interpret the statute to avoid results 

14 that would be very far out, at least. And -- and that's 

what I want you to tell me. How do I prevent that kind 

16 of risk through an interpretation of the statute? 

17  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, let me answer both that 

18 question and the Chief Justice's question which I think 

19 have similar responses. As to the rape victim, I am 

confident that an application of Section 1912(f) would 

21 lead to termination of that father's parental rights, 

22 and so he would never be in the picture as a possible --

23 well, the question whether or not custody of someone who 

24 has engaged in such conduct could lead to serious 

physical or emotional damage to the child, I think there

1 will be no difficulty in reaching that conclusion. 

2  But on the question of could a tribe 

3 establish some manipulative type of -- of membership 

4 criteria, it's significant that that is not this case 

because --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Aren't there Federal 

7 definitions of approvals of tribes? Not every group of 

8 native Americans who get together can call themselves a 

9 tribe. 

MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is quite right.

12 conditions of that a condition of blood and not -- not 

13 of voluntary membership?

2  MR. ROTHFELD: But it has always been the 

3 Cherokee membership criterion that if someone who can 

4 trace their lineal ancestry to some -- to a person who 

is on the Dawes Rolls is a member. No one has ever 

6 questioned that that is a legitimate basis for 

7 establishing tribal citizenship. And so --

8  JUSTICE ALITO: But what if a tribe makes 

9 eligibility available for anybody who, as a result of a 

DNA test, can establish any Indian ancestry, no matter 

11 how slight? 

12  MR. ROTHFELD: I think that that would lead 

13 to the question posed by Justice Scalia. Whether or not 

14 that would be a legitimate basis for establishing --

JUSTICE ALITO: No, it's different from his. 

16 He says it's -- it has to be based on blood. This would 

17 be based on blood. 

18  MR. ROTHFELD: But I -- I think it leads to 

19 his question that there is a Federal element to 

recognition of an Indian tribe. And I think whether or 

21 not tribal membership criteria so far depart from the 

22 traditional understanding of what constitutes a tribe as

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there are two 

2 forms of the EIFD doctrine, the existing Indian family 

3 doctrine. One applies directly to this case, what's the 

4 status of an unwed father, and they seem, under that 

doctrine, to apply the definition that a parent who 

6 hasn't been involved in the care during pregnancy is not 

7 a father. 

8  But the other side of the doctrine is the 

9 one that addresses, I think, the Chief's concern, which 

is you don't only have Indian blood, but you've been a 

11 father who's actually been a member of an Indian tribe, 

12 an active member. 

13  We don't have to reach that separate issue 

14 here, that EIFD -- that part of the EIFD doctrine. 

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I guess I'll give you 

16 two answers to that. First, in this case, there has 

17 been a finding by the family court that this father has 

18 significant ties to the Cherokee Nation. And so if one 

19 could think that that was part of the test under ICWA, 

it is certainly satisfied here. 

21  I -- I would go further than that and say 

22 that I think the vast majority of State courts have 

23 correctly rejected that theory because --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't disagree. 

MR. ROTHFELD: It -- it would be sort of

1 beyond the judicial competence to determine whether or 

2 not a particular person is Indian enough to qualify for 

3 treatment as a father of an Indian child under -- under 

4 ICWA. 

Just to nail this down, as to the particular 

6 membership criteria of the Cherokee Nation, no one has 

7 ever suggested, our opponents here do not suggest that 

8 that is, in any sense, illegitimate or not a traditional 

9 basis for establishing membership in an Indian tribe. 

So if one can imagine wild hypotheticals of 

11 the sort that Justice Alito and the Chief Justice have 

12 suggested, they are not present here, and those would 

13 present political questions to be addressed by Congress 

14 or addressed by the executive branch. 

In this case, again, the State courts found 

16 that ICWA should be applied to allow a natural father to 

17 raise his child. Those courts found that was in the 

18 best interests of the child to be raised by their 

19 natural parent because that parent was a fit, was a 

loving, was a devoted parent in the words of -- of the 

21 lower courts. Those conclusions were quite clearly 

22 correct. 

23  And if I can turn to something which 

24 attracted some attention from Justice Scalia and Justice 

Sotomayor in their exchanges with Ms. Blatt, the

1 application of Section 1912(d) and whether or not the 


2 parental rights of this -- this father, who 


3 unquestionably satisfies the definition of parent in 


4 ICWA, Section 1912(d) says that parental rights cannot 


be terminated unless remedial efforts have been made, 

6 rehabilitative efforts have been made to fix a family 

7 that is broken in some respect. 

8  And Ms. Blatt suggests that that does not 

9 apply here because there was no Indian family. I think 

what Justice Scalia said was absolutely right. There 

11 unquestionably was a family here in the ordinary sense. 

12 There was a mother, there was a father, there was their 

13 little girl, there were grandparents who very much 

14 wanted to be involved in the life of this child, who 

knit socks for her. There's no question --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is my recollection correct 

17 that -- that he had offered to -- to marry the mother, 

18 and she rejected that? 

19  MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is quite 

correct. I think that the genesis of this case, they --

21 they were an engaged couple and the mother broke the 

22 engagement. The father wanted, very much wanted to 

23 marry the mother, wanted to --

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that there's 

some ambiguity there because one reason why he wanted to

2  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, there -- there are 


3 disputed facts as to what was going on, and so I don't 


4 want to hinge a lot on this. But I think it is quite 


clear the father -- they were engaged, the father wanted 

6 to marry the mother. 

7  The father's testimony -- and the family 

8 court found, so we're not talking about simply, you 

9 know, assertions here. The family court found that the 

father was excited by the pregnancy, was looking forward 

11 to the birth of the child, that he wanted to marry the 

12 mother so that she would qualify for military health 

13 benefits. The father at the time --

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He was excited, but 

there is no doubt he paid nothing during the pregnancy 

16 and nothing at the time of the birth, right, to support 

17 the child or the mother? 

18  MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is true. But 

19 I -- I am --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So he was excited by 

21 it, he just didn't want to take any responsibility.

4 judges all by themselves every day have these difficult 

problems. If we could appoint King Solomon, who was the 

6 first domestic relations judge, as special master, we 

7 could do it. But we can't do it. 

8  MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that -- that --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY. But what we have -- what 

we have here is a question of a Federal statute which, 

11 as I must understand it, displaces the ordinary best 

12 interest determinations of the State courts. Would you 

13 agree with that? 

14  MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I would agree that 

Congress indicated that part of the best interest 

16 inquiry for an Indian child concerns -- takes account of 

17 their status as an Indian child, and Congress made a 

18 factual determination -- the fact that --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know why you make 

that concession. I mean, your client has been deprived 

21 of parental rights. I do not know that -- that it is 

22 traditional to decide whether a parent will be deprived 

23 of parental rights by assessing what is in the best 

24 interest of the child. 

That seems to me quite --

7 respect to that --


8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under South Carolina law 


9 in this adoption proceeding, the -- if it had not been 


for the statute, the best interest of the child standard 

11 would not have applied? 

12  MR. ROTHFELD: I think there are three 

13 things that are going on here. 

14  Had ICWA not applied here at all, then the 

father would have had no right to object to the 

16 adoption, so the adoption would have gone forward had it 

17 not been for ICWA. 

18  However, as Justice Scalia says correctly, 

19 when a natural parent is involved, and the natural 

parent has rights that have not yet been terminated, as 

21 this parent's have not, then ordinarily a best interest 

22 inquiry --

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: He would be out under 

24 South Carolina law because he didn't support the child 

during the pregnancy.

1  MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I have to disagree with 

2 that, Justice Ginsburg. The family court judge found 

3 that his parental rights could not be terminated as a 

4 matter of South Carolina law, as well as a matter of 

ICWA law. And so we think it is quite clear that this 

6 father's right would not be terminated. 

7  As Justice Scalia says, in the ordinary 

8 course, while we're not engaged in a free-floating best 

9 interest inquiry, one would say whether or not a -- a 

profound showing of parental neglect or insufficiency 

11 has been made to terminate those rights. If it cannot, 

12 then that father should get custody. 

13  In response to what Justice Kennedy had 

14 asked about --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Termination of parental 

16 rights requires a showing that it's an unfit parent, 

17 which is quite --

18  MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is absolutely 

19 right, and no such showing has been made or could be 

made in this case.

1 situation here and found that this father, far from

3 who had created a safe, satisfactory and -- and loving

Under ordinary South Carolina standards, 

6 once one gets past ICWA, parental rights cannot be 

7 terminated in a situation of this sort, the parental 

8 rights, as Justice Scalia says, of a natural parent, who 

9 had --

11 have come out the same way under purely South Carolina 

12 law, then why are we here?

1 "parent" under the Act because I think a lot flows from 

2 that. The Act provides that a parent -- a parent of an 

3 Indian child is the -- if it's the biological parent, 

4 except where the child -- or where the parent -- paternity 

has not been established or acknowledged. 


6  Here, the -- the father's paternity was 


7 acknowledged and established, both courts below found. 


8 As a consequence, he has not simply a biological 


9 relationship to the child, he has a legal relationship 


to the child, created under Federal law.

once -- in the unwed father situation, once the father 

6 establishes or acknowledges paternity, the father has a 

7 legal relationship, not just the --

8  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, family law is 

9 traditionally a State province, but your argument is 

that Federal law can take a traditional family law term 

11 like "parent" and perhaps others and give it a meaning 

12 that is very different from its traditional meaning or 

13 its meaning under State law? 

14  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, several things about 

that. 

16  JUSTICE ALITO: Strike the "traditional" 

17 meaning, but its meaning under State law. 

18  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, several things about 

19 that. First, there are States -- the Casey amicus brief 

in footnote 7 identifies a number of States which 

21 recognize parental rights for a parent who has 

22 established or acknowledged citizenship. So the State 

23 law varies on that. 

24  And this was the -- one of the very problems 

Congress was concerned about with respect to Indian 

53

1 children because --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. I didn't understand. 

3 Citizenship, who has acknowledged citizenship? 

4  MR. KNEEDLER: I'm sorry. I meant to say 

paternity. Sorry. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I understand now. 

7  MR. KNEEDLER: What you have here -- what 

8 you have here are people who are citizens of two 

9 separate sovereigns. An Indian tribe is a sovereign and 

a State. Congress tried to accommodate those competing 

11 interests by leaving the cases in State court, letting 

12 them be subject to State law, but subject to minimum 

13 standards to protect the people who are citizens -- or 

14 eligible for citizenship in the Indian tribe. 

That is a classic implementation of 

16 Congress's plenary responsibility in the Federal trust 

17 and guardianship for Indians, and nothing could be more 

18 at the core of tribal self-determination and tribal 

19 survival than the determination of tribal membership and 

the care about what happens to Indian children. 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Kneedler, let's say 

22 you're right that this man is a parent under the terms 

23 of the Act, so not just a biological father, but also he 

24 has a legal status as parent under this Act. And then 

1912 says, well, this is how you go about terminating 

54

1 parental rights, right? 

2  But then your argument suggests that one of 

3 these clauses applies to him and the other one doesn't, 

4 even though he's a parent. But you're saying he only 

gets some of the protections, that there are really two 

6 classes of parents, custodial parents and non. 

7  So where does that come from? 

8  MR. KNEEDLER: I think it's not two classes 

9 of parents. It comes from the text of (f) itself, which 

talks about continued custody, which we -- we think 

11 means that (f) applies -- it presupposes that there is 

12 custody to continue. And that's just a condition on the 

13 termination of parental rights. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a very strange way 

to put it. I mean, just -- just in passing in the 

16 sentence, that "the continued custody." I mean, you 

17 would think if that's what they meant, they would say, 

18 "where the child" is -- "is within the custody of a 

19 parent, comma, no termination of parental rights may be 

ordered, in the absence of a determination," blah, blah, 

21 blah, blah, blah. 

22  It doesn't say that. It says, "No 

23 termination may be ordered in absence of a 

24 determination, including testimony of a qualified 

expert, that the continued custody of the child by the

1 parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in 


2 serious emotional." 


3  When it's -- when it's framed that way, I 


4 am -- I am inclined to believe that the "continued 


custody" means looks to the future, the continuing 


6 custody by this person in the future. To read into it 


7 the fact that -- that the whole provision only applies 


8 to someone who is then in custody of the child, that's 


9 very strange. That's -- that's not the way somebody 


would write a provision like that. 

11  MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I grant you it is 

12 somewhat awkwardly written, but we think the sense of it 

13 is -- is that because this is -- as this Court noted in 

14 the Santosky decision, this is a very unusual statutory 

provision with respect to the burden of proof. 

16  And there is some logic for Congress 

17 applying this -- this -- where there is a custodial --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: But doesn't it happen, in 

19 your interpretation, unlike the two parties who have an 

interpretation I can understand, that -- remember my 

21 hypothetical, which I deliberately made dramatic. We 

22 can think of a whole range of things short of that where 

23 the father has seen the mother never, perhaps, or sperm 

24 donors for very short periods of time, and under your 

interpretation where there is an ongoing relationship,

1 even a short one, at least they can't give the child to 

2 the father where it would be very harmful to the -- to 

3 the child. 

4  But under your interpretation, the one 

category of people who is exempt from that are the 

6 category of fathers who've never seen the mother. 

7 Who've seen the mother a very short time. Who may be in 

8 -- they're not even subject to looking to see if it's 

9 very harmful to the child. 

So I just -- am I right about your 

11 interpretation having that effect? And if it does have 

12 that effect, what's the justification for it? 

13  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the -- there's 

14 several -- several things about that with respect to the 

rapist and the sperm donor. In the 35-year history of

as you're suggesting because state law standards still 

6 apply, and under state law standard under Santosky, 

7 there has to be clear and convincing evidence to 

8 terminate -- to apply the State termination of parental 

9 rights provisions, which is what the family court did in 

this case. 

11  This is -- this is a Federal overlay, an 

12 additional requirement. 

13  If I could, though, move on to --

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: But as a Federal overlay, 

Mr. Kneedler, I mean, does it make sense to sort of 

16 split apart (d) and (f) in this way? Because (d) is the 

17 curing provision that says you have to take steps to try 

18 to cure this parent and, you know, to try to make him or 

19 her a better parent. And then (f) says here's the

21 curative efforts have failed. Right? 

22  So to -- to use -- to have the curative 

23 provision but not the standard just seems to -- to make 

24 a -- a mess of the statute.

1 think so because custody is in the one and -- and not in 

2 the other. (D) speaks of breakup of -- of the family 

3 relationship. And I think there, the family 

4 relationship because it -- it speaks of termination of 

parental rights, which is in turn defined in the Act as 

6 anything that terminates the parent-child relationship, 

7 which -- which can be much broader than -- than whether 

8 the parent actually has custody, which is the word 

9 that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the whole thrust of 

11 it, you -- this is directed to providing remedial 

12 services, which it -- it seems that it fits a situation 

13 where someone has custody but is having problems getting 

14 his or her act together so needs the help of a social 

worker, but it makes no sense to talk about remedial 

16 services for someone who has never had custody. 

17  MR. KNEEDLER: Not -- with -- with respect, 

18 Justice Ginsburg, I don't agree. Remedial services here 

19 would entail -- the remedial services have to be tied to 

whatever the problem is. And here the problem was the 

21 father had not shown sufficient interest in the child. 

22 Remedial services would have been efforts to interest 

23 the father in the child. 

24  Here that wasn't necessary because as soon 

as the father found out about the adoption proceeding,

1 he acknowledged and established his paternity and said, 

2 I want that child. 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he didn't want 

4 anything to do with the child if the mother had kept the 

child in her care. It was only when she wanted to put 

6 it up for adoption that he had developed this interest 

7 in the child. 

8  MR. KNEEDLER: And that's -- that is 

9 precisely the point when ICWA kicks in. ICWA does not 

try to regulate the relationship between the mother and 

11 the father. That is -- that is left to State law or 

12 tribal law. ICWA kicks in only when there's going to be 

13 an adoption or a termination of rights and the child is 

14 going to be placed outside of -- of the relationship. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what's -- is --

16 is -- are the would-be adoptive parents required to 

17 provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs 

18 under (d)? 

19  MR. KNEEDLER: No, their burden is to 

demonstrate that that has happened. The remedial --

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that it's a 

22 tribe -- if the tribe wants to defeat the adoption, all 

23 they have to do is do nothing with respect to the 

24 father's --

11  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT 

12  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

13  MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

14 and may it please the Court: 

If you affirm below, you're basically 

16 banning the interracial adoption of abandoned Indian 

17 children. There's not a single adoptive parent in their 

18 right mind who is going to do what the court below said, 

19 which is go through these Kafkaesque hoops of making 

sure an absentee father's desire to be a parent has been 

21 stimulated. 

22  This is a private adoption. This is absurd 

23 that an adoptive parent would beg the family court to go 

24 provide parenting classes. And I wanted to --

1 terms of voluntary surrender of Indian children by 

2 parents, says that it's not final for an adoptive parent 

3 until the court does the adoption decree. It gives the 

4 mother the right -- or father -- to rescind the 

voluntary adoption till the very last minute. Has that 

6 stopped adopt -- voluntary adoptions? 

7  MS. BLATT: No, but this -- first of all --

8 I mean, I love that about this case, the irony here. He 

9 had no -- we didn't need his consent under State law, so 

the application of 1913, which allowed this withdrawal 

11 of consent, mandates the return of the child. 

12  Well, there was no way to return this child 

13 to anybody other than the mother. And I want you to 

14 keep in mind about this case, is your decision is going 

to apply to the next case and to a apartment in New York 

16 City where a tribal member impregnates someone who's 

17 African-American or Jewish or Asian Indian, and in that 

18 view, even though the father is a completely absentee 

19 father, you are rendering these women second-class 

citizens with inferior rights to direct their 

21 reproductive rights and their -- who raises their child. 

22  You are relegating adoptive parents to go to 

23 the back of the bus and wait in line if they can adopt. 

24 And you're basically relegating the child, the child to 

a piece of property with a sign that says, "Indian, keep

That was its intent. 

You don't think that that's

11 establish much more difficult standards for the adoption 

12 of -- of a child --

13  MS. BLATT: No, no, Justice Scalia. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, maybe you -- you 

disagree with that policy, but that's clearly a policy 

16 behind the law. 

17  MS. BLATT: No, I think the policy is 

18 fantastic. It was talking about Indian families who 

19 were being ripped away because of cultural biases and 

insensitivity. This case didn't involve cultural 

21 biases. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: It didn't say that. It --

23 its definition of --

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That, Ms. Blatt, is what 

2 provoked the Act that Indian children were being removed 

3 from their families, but the Act is written in much 

4 broader terms. 

MS. BLATT: I agree. 1915 is extraordinary, 

6 if you read it the way the tribe does, which is -- and 

7 the government does. 

8  And a little bit about the membership 

9 criteria. The tribe's view is any child born Indian is 

automatically a member. So even if the parents withdrew 

11 their tribal membership, this child would be covered.
