 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next this morning in Case 09-1205, Smith versus Bayer 

Corporation.

 Mr. Monahan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. MONAHAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. MONAHAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Petitioners Keith Smith and Shirley 

Sperlazza were not named plaintiffs in the prior Federal 

proceeding litigated by George McCollins. They never 

received notice of that prior proceeding; they never 

received an opportunity to appear and be heard; they 

never received an opportunity to opt out; and they never 

received an opportunity to appeal the decision denying 

class certification.

 No precedent of this Court would justify 

treating -- treating people as parties under preclusion 

principles under these circumstances. Recently, in 

Taylor v. Sturgell, this Court addressed the rule 

against nonparty preclusion and discussed the recognized 

exceptions. The Court in that case discussed a properly 

conducted class action as being one of the exceptions.

The Court, in discussing these preclusion 

rules, noted that they are limited by due process 

concerns, and the Court noted that the properly 

conducted class action is an exception due to the due 

process protections incorporated into Rule 23.

 Obviously, this Court has discussed the due 

process protections with class actions in prior cases, 

particularly those dealing with 23(b)(3) classes in 

cases such as Eisen and Shutts. The Court has noted 

that whenever a class is certified notice must be 

provided; the right to -- notice must be provided; they 

must have the right to appear and be heard in person or 

by counsel; they must have the right to opt out as well 

as protection of adequate representations.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose a class action 

based on diversity is filed in one of the Federal 

districts in West Virginia, and the district court 

denies class certification. The same plaintiff, the 

same plaintiff's attorney, takes the old complaint, 

writes in the name of the new named party, files exactly 

the same complaint in another Federal -- in the other 

Federal district in West Virginia. Would your argument 

be the same? That can go forward, get another shot at 

class certification?

 MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, under the -- yes,

under those circumstances, as outlined by -- by Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: All you have to do is get 

a new named plaintiff?

 MR. MONAHAN: Yes, as long as it's not the 

same party. If it's a different party -- and that -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it could be the same 

attorney?

 MR. MONAHAN: Yes, it could be the same 

attorney. This Court noted that in Taylor v. Sturgell, 

in South -- South Central Bell v. Alabama, and also as 

discussed in the Richards case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would the -- would the 

decision that's saying -- saying Rule 23 standards have 

not been met, the individual issues predominate over the 

common issue -- doesn't that deserve some measure of 

respect when the same thing is tried again?

 MR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor, but that 

would be under stare decisis principles, we believe, and 

that's the situation, since it is a different party, 

since it's not the same party itself. And, certainly, 

the district courts in West Virginia would look to other 

district courts' opinions and would likely render them 

persuasive -- or consider them persuasive under those 

circumstances.

JUSTICE ALITO: But they have no obligation 

to follow another district court opinion, do they?

 MR. MONAHAN: Technically, no, Your Honor. 

If the Fourth Circuit, for instance, had spoken on the 

matter, though, and it was something that was decided by 

the Fourth Circuit, or of course by this Court, then 

clearly they would. And the -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And this one was 

determined by the multidistrict panel, right?

 MR. MONAHAN: Yes. Yes, a district judge in 

Minnesota. Yes, Your Honor.

 Interestingly, in Taylor, this Court noted 

that adopting a broad theory of virtual representation 

based upon an identity of interests, adequate 

representation, and a close relationship would -- would, 

in essence, be equivalent to adopting a de facto class 

action or recognizing a common law class action without 

any of the procedural due process protections provided 

by Rule 23.

 Obviously, in dealing with these cases, the 

main reason a certification is -- the main reason the 

due process protection is provided upon certification is 

to go ahead and justify binding the class members to any 

judgment issued by the court at that point. Until you 

have that, unless you have the certification and the due

process protections for a Rule 23(b)(3) class, until you 

have those, the absent class members remain strangers to 

the proceeding.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the absent class 

members retain their individual right. I mean, they are 

not being precluded as to their individual claim. It's 

only they can't be a class representative.

 MR. MONAHAN: That's -- that's true, Your 

Honor. We submit, however, that any procedural rights 

which have been recognized and adopted -- those 

procedural rights, just as the substantive claim itself, 

have to be adjudicated consistent with due process. And 

West Virginia itself has adopted Rule 23 of the West 

Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure, and that State has 

the right to apply and interpret that rule as it sees 

fit to manage its own docket and administrate its own 

docket as it sees fit.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Am I right to read the 

supplemental brief as saying that now the West Virginia 

Supreme Court agrees with the multidistrict panel on 

what the content of West Virginia law is?

 MR. MONAHAN: That's not correct, Your 

Honor. All of the issues raised in our petition for 

cert remain just as they were. At worst -- if White v. 

Wyeth withstands petition for rehearing, at worst we

lose our CCPA claim. That certainly is a valuable claim 

to us. I will not dispute that. But we also have a 

common law fraud claim. We also have breach of warranty 

claims, and those are still in existence.

 And the critical fact of this case in that 

regard is the question of whether or not a class may be 

certified under West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure 

has never been litigated, has never been decided by any 

court.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Monahan, do you 

mean by that that you would have a blanket rule that a 

decision on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 can never 

be preclusive as to a State Rule of Civil Procedure 23?

 MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I believe it would 

depend upon whether or not that State has said that not 

only are we going to look at these Federal decisions as 

being persuasive, but we're going to consider ourself 

bound by the decisions of the Fourth District or the 

United States District Court for the Southern District 

of West Virginia.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose the State 

says: We will not consider ourselves bound; we do have 

our own law with respect to Rule 23, but sometimes we'll 

go along with the Federal rule and sometimes we won't. 

Is it then up to the courts to actually try to determine

whether the -- the West Virginia court in this case 

would have gone along, would have interpreted its own 

rule of civil procedure the same way that the Federal 

court interpreted the Federal rule?

 MR. MONAHAN: Well, for instance, what Your 

Honor suggested is essentially what the West Virginia 

Supreme Court of Appeals does. I mean, they will -­

they will consider them to be persuasive. They will 

consider them -- but in their In re Rezulin case, the 

court noted -- the court actually criticized the circuit 

judge for relying exclusively on Federal decisions 

denying class certification in medical device or 

prescription drug cases. And the court noted that, you 

know, although we will look at those rules and they may 

be persuasive, they are not binding or controlling on 

us, and that's because we do not want our legal analysis 

to be nothing more than a mere Pavlovian response to 

Federal decisional rules.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What is -- what is the 

difference between the Federal law and the West Virginia 

law on the class certification issue? Not the 

application to this particular complaint, but as to the 

-- the standard. What do you see as the difference 

between the Federal standard and the West Virginia 

standard?

MR. MONAHAN: The main difference, Justice 

Alito, is that our court has -- and they cite this in 

In re Rezulin, for instance. They cite Newberg on Class 

Actions as one of the authorities to support this 

principle, but they note that in -- in our court that 

normally challenges based upon reliance, causation, and 

damages will not bar certification on a predominance 

basis, because those go to the right of the individual 

to recover, but not to the overall liability issues of 

the defendant, which it believes can be addressed as 

common issues in many cases and save the court an 

extreme amount of time addressing those common issues.

 Now, the court indicates that if individual 

trials need to be conducted later on, on any of those 

issues, if there are truly individual issues that need 

to be resolved concerning those claims, individual 

trials can be accomplished.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: On the ground that the 

court here, the Federal court, decided that there 

weren't predominant issues based mostly on the fact 

that, like the Virginia court has now, it's decided that 

there is no economic loss, what were the differences?

 What were the differences here? How would 

the difference in standard play out here?

is an interesting aspect of this case -- that the 

court's not only trying to bind us on the procedural 

ruling but is also trying to bind us in a substantive 

ruling as to what the elements of the claims in West 

Virginia are and as to what's needed to prove those 

claims.

 For instance, the Eighth Circuit has -- has 

held that, in looking at the district court's opinion, 

that it has held that an actual physical injury is 

required, that economic loss alone is not enough. 

Clearly, that's not consistent with West Virginia law. 

An economic loss alone can be sufficient. In West -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The -- I'm sorry. I 

don't mean to cut you off. But you're really arguing 

that due process requires the same treatment, 

essentially, of notice and an opportunity to be heard 

that we are giving to a substantive decision that blocks 

a future member from pursuing his or her claim, correct?

 MR. MONAHAN: Yes, very similar, Your Honor. 

I mean, in this circumstance -- I mean, these rights are 

provided. These procedural rights, once they are 

created, are being provided, and they can't be taken 

away without due process. West Virginia has recognized 

the right to -- to proceed in our court under our rule, 

and not -- you don't have a guarantee --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're almost treating 

it as a property right, and -- and you're basically 

saying we're equating it with, essentially, a property 

right.

 MR. MONAHAN: Well, I think -- I think what 

I'm trying to say, Your Honor, is that these type of 

procedural rights -- whenever you have a substantive 

claim which is a property right, and you seek to 

litigate them, you shall have available to you all the 

Rules of Civil Procedure which have been adopted and 

recognized, and those procedural elements of the claim 

should be treated or adjudicated just the same as a 

substantive claim, consistent with due process.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we disagree with you, 

because there is a difference of some sort between 

procedure and substantive rights, then what would 

command the due process violation in a situation in 

which the Federal litigation has applied essentially the 

same standard that the State has and there has been 

adequate representation on the procedural question, 

where no substantive right of a plaintiff has been 

extinguished?

 That's a lot of conditions, but those are 

the three conditions of this case. So, what in due 

process requires that outcome, your outcome?

substantive right. If I return to my question of what 

makes a procedural right substantive -­

MR. MONAHAN: Well, this particular 

procedural right is very closely connected -- I mean, 

one of the main purposes of a class action is to level 

the economic playing field and to enable people with 

small individual claims to aggregate them in order to 

seek justice. Without those -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Actually not true. The 

plaintiff here received the same thing. The issue is 

how much money the lawyers are going to receive, 

really -­

MR. MONAHAN: Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because plaintiff 

gets their attorney's fees, gets a statutory violation 

amount, which is going to be the same whether it's in a 

class action or an individual action, so it's really not 

the plaintiff who stands to win.

are correct in this -- in this particular case, because, 

one, obviously if we lose the CCPA claim in light of the 

White case, there would be no statutory attorney fees. 

And even if we had the CCPA claim, it's -- the court has 

discretion. It may award them. There's no requirement 

that it do so, no requirement whatsoever.

 And how can anybody bring -- any lawyer 

trying to bring one of these small damage claims -- if 

the damages are only $100, $200 per plaintiff, for 

instance, how could any lawyer justify facing a 

defendant such as Bayer in a complex product liability 

action? Just the cost alone of having experts, of doing 

discovery -- all those matters would greatly exceed the 

value of the claim itself. So the class action is the 

only way in which to aggregate the claims and level the 

economic playing field for everybody.

 The other thing, I would note for the common 

law fraud claim, West Virginia does have a bad-faith 

exception for attorney fees, but that depends on the 

degree of fraud that the court finds, and that -- that, 

in and of itself, is discretionary.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- how far 

does your procedural right extend? Let's say in the 

second action, the court says, look, we've been through 

all this before; we have had a million pages of

discovery from the prior action, no protective order at 

all. So while, if you were the first person here, 

you're entitled to, you know, 10 interrogatories, 

because we've been through this before, I'm going to say 

you can look at all the discovery that's there, but you 

only get 5 interrogatories.

 Now, do you say no, no, no, I'm entitled to 

the same procedural rights I'd have if I were here 

first? Is that right?

 MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I think the court 

does have some flexibility, depending upon the 

procedural rule at issue. And -- and, in essence, the 

court is applying almost essentially the stare decisis 

type of principles there. We have resolved this exact 

discovery issue before, the exact arguments -­

 MR. MONAHAN: Well, I certainly think the 

Court needs to examine the procedural aspect and its 

importance, and the part that it plays. I mean, for 

instance, one of the problems we have in this situation 

is that normally res judicata and collateral estoppel do

not normally apply to mere procedural rulings. They're 

not normally used for that purpose.

 Most cases where they are used for that 

purpose are cases where a dismissal has occurred based 

upon a procedural ruling or a procedural failing. And 

whenever they apply collateral estoppel and res 

judicata, it's almost -- every case I've seen deals with 

the exact same party in another proceeding. And there 

they preclude them. But here is a totally different 

party. And the issue under West Virginia law has never 

been litigated by any court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: A totally different 

party -- if a person, say an intervenor, joins a 

litigation late, and there have been a lot of procedural 

rulings, I guess that that intervenor takes the case as 

he finds it. Now, he could go to the judge and say: 

Judge, I want you to reconsider your procedural ruling 

in light of the fact I'm here.

 How does the situation I've just sketched 

differ from this one? I mean, you have a client who's 

coming to the litigation late. He's separate from the 

litigation, I know, but he could send a representative 

to the judge and say: Judge, I want you to reconsider 

in light of the fact I'm joining. Now, I know I'm not 

joining; in fact, I'm bringing a different case.

But I'm thinking of the -- of the Chief 

Justice's hypo, here and I'm -- and I'm trying to apply 

it. And is your client analogous to that person who 

joins litigation late?

 MR. MONAHAN: No, Your Honor, because -- I 

mean, for instance, this Court has noted -- and they 

noted it, I believe in the -- you noted it in the 

Richards case. The Chase National Bank v. Norwalk and 

Martin v. Wilks has noted that a stranger to litigation 

has no duty to seek to intervene in the case; however, 

they can; they can seek to intervene if they have 

notice, if they so choose.

 If you take that affirmative step to 

intervene, knowing what has happened in that case, you 

obviously have notice of the case because you're 

choosing to intervene. And if you seek to intervene 

having that notice, then you take it as you find it.

 Now, you can certainly ask the court to 

reconsider because you want to raise new arguments, but 

there would be no obligation to do so.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Here you have a different 

forum. You pick up a different plaintiff, and you go to 

a different forum. How -- and I guess your answer is 

that you could go on and on and on until -- until maybe 

you find a judge who will certify this class.

MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I don't -- I don't 

believe so. I don't believe that's the case because 

there are limitations to that. One would be, I think, 

if you filed at another Federal court, for instance, 

Rule 23 would be the same legal standard. Federal Rule 

23 is the same legal standard in all Federal courts.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we have a new 

plaintiff, so that plaintiff wouldn't have had notice 

and an opportunity to be -- to be heard.

 MR. MONAHAN: For preclusion purposes, 

that's correct. But I think the Federal court certainly 

would look at those cases for stare decisis purposes in 

looking as to whether or not the class should be 

certified under the same legal standard.

 Now, here we do have a different forum. We 

have the State of West Virginia, as a separate 

sovereign, has its own rights to do this. But, once -­

once -- if a class would be denied in West Virginia at 

one time, I believe that the chances of having another 

one succeed are very low, because courts will look to 

those stare decisis principles.

States.

if -- and if the plaintiff was asking for a nationwide 

class action.

 MR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor, and the issue 

with that, though, is this Court has -- in Taylor v. 

Sturgell, for instance, which Your Honor authored, the 

Government argued in that case that, you know, we should 

adopt this virtual representation theory because of 

repetitive litigation. We had this FOIA request. Any 

person out there can file asking the government for 

these documents, and the government may have to go on 

thousands of times, millions of times, conceivably, to 

do this.

 And this Court note -- noted that the threat 

of repetitive litigation is not sufficient to justify 

adopting a new exception to the rule against nonparty 

preclusion.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What kind of notice do you 

think due process would require? If the court in which 

the case was first filed thought, I'm not going waste --

I don't want to waste my time on this class 

certification issue if it's just going to be re­

litigated over and over and over again, so I want to 

provide sufficient notice so that the members of a class 

will be bound by my -- by my class certification issue, 

what -- what would have to be done? Would they all have

to be given individual notice and asked to opt out?

 MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, I -- I believe so. 

I believe -- I mean, consistent with Shutts, this 

Court's ruling in Shutts and Eisen, I think they would, 

because once they had the notice and that they would 

decide not to opt out, then they would be bound by any 

ruling that the -- that the court issues there. But 

if -- if they don't have that opportunity, especially 

whenever -- and this case also involves the 

Anti-Injunction Act, of course, the principles of 

federalism and comity, and any question under the 

Anti-Injunction Act, any doubt, should go against 

issuing injunctions.

 And the -- the exceptions to that Act are 

narrowly construed in light of principles of federalism, 

and because we do have a separate State here and we're 

trying to apply or seek State relief and seek the State 

rules and follow the State rules, I do believe you would 

need the same notice that we have in Shutts, the notice, 

the opportunity to appear, and the opportunity to opt 

out.

 Now, certainly, other issues -- if we're 

talking about policy concerns, another thing that I 

would note is that in CAFA recently -- whenever Congress 

adopted CAFA, certainly if they believe that basing

one -- using one class denial in Federal court as a 

basis to preclude all other similar classes seeking -­

seeking certification, if they thought that was 

consistent with due process, certainly they could have 

considered adopting that as part of CAFA. But they 

chose to deal with it in a very different way, a very 

different manner, and that was to go ahead and change 

the jurisdictional status in diversity cases, make 

minimal diversity and allow removal with certain -- you 

know, certain exceptions for certain discretionary ones, 

stay at home and local controversy exceptions, but they 

didn't -- I mean, that's how they chose to deal with it.

 Now, certainly, we would admit that since 

CAFA has been enacted, the chance -- certainly, there's 

not nearly as many of these cases which will occur where 

this would -- where this will be an issue, because many 

large classes now will get removed. And -­

concerned about. And they were concerned about, again, 

some States being too permissive in granting class 

certifications, and they were worried about some of 

those same factors.

 But, you know, one of the primary concerns 

on all -- in CAFA itself, though, was protecting the 

absent class members' rights, and this Court's noted 

those same rights in Amchem and Ortiz. In many of its 

cases, your cases, you've noted that that's a principal 

concern. And this Court has heightened the standard in 

those class -- class settlement certifications for the 

court to make sure that each and every element and 

requirement is met, to ensure that -- that the 

settlement itself is fair to all class members, 

including the absent class members, and that, you 

know -- and that the attorney fees are fair.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Wouldn't it be a violation 

-- wouldn't it be a violation of due process if Congress 

enacted a statute or if there were a rule adopted that 

said that the first ruling on class certification by a 

Federal court binds all members of the class in any 

other Federal litigation? Would that be a -- then they 

would retain their individual claims, but there could 

not be another -- another class action -- another class 

action filed. Would that be a due process violation?

those cases. Certainly, I think you could -- because -­

members who were not truly parties, I believe some of 

those due process concerns could be raised.

 But you certainly would not have the 

elements of the federalism; you would not have the

applying their own rules.

JUSTICE BREYER: Did it ever happen -- did 

you ever come across an instance before where in a 

Federal court a judge in the district court says, no, 

you can't have a certification, no; and then a different 

plaintiff went to a different Federal court in a 

different part of the country and asked for a similar 

certification? Have you ever found anything like that 

in precedent, that it's in two Federal courts rather 

than the State/Federal?

 MR. MONAHAN: Yes, Your Honor. I believe 

that maybe Thorogood, the recent Thorogood case out of 

the Seventh Circuit, might involve something similar to 

that.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP S. BECK

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. BECK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The core issue here is whether absent class 

members can be bound by a denial of class certification 

where there was adequate representation on that issue 

but not notice and opportunity to be heard.

issue," Mr. Beck, on what issue? Because I think that

there is an argument in this case that the West Virginia 

approach to class certification is different from the 

Eighth Circuit's approach, that Rezulin would not have 

been the way that the Eighth Circuit would have 

approached the class certification question.

 MR. BECK: The issue that was decided and 

preclusive was the issue of predominance, Your Honor, 

and what happened there is that Judge Davis, the judge 

who was supervising the multidistrict litigation, he 

made a determination under West Virginia law as to 

what's required to make out an economic loss claim, and 

he concluded that what is required is individual proof 

of injury as well as individual proof of causation. And 

then he went on to describe what kind of evidence would 

be necessary to do that.

 So he made a legal determination, and then 

he went -- and then after looking at what kind of 

evidence would be required -- excuse me -- made a -- I 

think a mixed law and fact determination that, given 

that, individual issues would predominate over common 

issues. His -- his interpretation of West Virginia law 

was later vindicated by the West Virginia Supreme Court 

in White, where they held that -- that there is a 

requirement of individual proof of injury, which had 

been contested by Petitioners, and it's clear that it's

going to require the same exact kind of inquiry.

 So what we have is that there's no 

suggestion in Rezulin or anywhere else that the 

predominance requirement under the West Virginia version 

of Rule 23, which is essentially identical to the 

Federal version, has any other content that's different 

from the Federal version.

 In Rezulin, there's a suggestion that when 

-- that the West Virginia courts would treat differences 

in -- in damages or reliance as less significant than 

some Federal courts, but nothing at all that suggests in 

any way that if the underlying cause of action requires 

individual proof of injury and causation, that somehow 

that common questions are going to predominate over 

individual questions. There's no suggestion of that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We couldn't know. We 

couldn't -- when they went to the West Virginia Supreme 

Court, that was before this White v. Wyeth. They were 

arguing a question of substantive law: What do we have 

to show in order to get damages, when we say we weren't 

hurt by the drug? We're saying -- we're not saying we 

didn't get any benefit from it; we're just saying we 

paid more money for it than we should because it wasn't 

of the quality that it was represented to be.

a determination of West Virginia law, no, it's not the 

law; you have to show causation, some harm to you. But 

then when they -- when these plaintiffs went to the West 

Virginia court, that was still an open question of West 

Virginia law, and the West Virginia courts might have 

decided it differently than the Federal court, right?

 MR. BECK: Yes. Well, yes -- when the 

Federal district judge made the determination, it was in 

Mr. McCollins's case, and he's called upon to resolve 

questions of State law just like courts are every day in 

diversity actions. And he resolved the question of 

State law, what's required by the West Virginia Consumer 

Credit and Protection Act.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But sometimes Federal 

judges -- they try their best, but they're not the last 

word on what the State law is.

 MR. BECK: And some -- and, Your Honor, if 

-- if for example, Judge Davis had found as he did in 

McCollins, and then he had issued the same injunction, 

and then the White case had come down the other way, 

that -- that says that there is no requirement of 

injury, then conceivably the Petitioners could have gone 

back to Judge Davis and asked for relief from his 

injunction. And then we'd have an interesting 

question --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not these Petitioners. 

They weren't parties to the case before -­

MR. BECK: No, but they were -- they were 

parties to the injunction proceeding. They were the 

defendants in the injunction proceeding. So they're 

subject to an injunction, and then -- then the law 

changes, or the law is declared differently by the West 

Virginia Supreme Court.

 Nothing would have precluded them from 

coming back in front of Judge Davis and said: 

Respectfully, sir, you -- you were wrong in your 

prediction, and we'd like to be relieved from the 

injunction.

 And then we'd have a very interesting 

question about whether being correct or incorrect is -­

is something that can eliminate the law of preclusion, 

because normally if -- if a party is precluded, they're 

not allowed to say I shouldn't be precluded because I 

think the judge made a mistake on the law. But we don't 

have that here because, in fact, Judge Davis was 

vindicated on the content of West Virginia law.

sure that White answers the question that I asked, 

because White decided a matter of substantive liability,

class certification was different in the Eighth Circuit 

and in West Virginia.

 MR. BECK: Yes.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: If you look at Rezulin, if 

you compare to it some Eighth Circuit cases, there seems 

to be a difference in at least tone, shall we say, about 

the extent to which a finding is required that common 

issues predominate.

 MR. BECK: I think that, actually, Judge 

Davis took into account the difference in tone, and he 

looked very carefully at Rezulin, and he said that what 

Rezulin was focusing on was individual questions of 

damages, which defendants often argue is enough so that 

individual questions predominate, individual questions 

of reliance, which we also often argue mean that 

individual questions predominate.

 But he said this is different, because this 

is -- in order to prove liability, they've got to 

establish individual injury, which means, on a 

person-by-person basis, either that they were harmed by 

the drug or that the drug didn't work to lower their 

cholesterol as -- as it was supposed to, and they have 

to show that whatever the violation of the Consumer 

Fraud Act was is causally linked there.

 And he said that's a different animal from

questions of reliance and damages. And -- and I've 

heard or read no conceivable explanation about how, 

under any standard of predominance, you could have 

common questions predominating when every single member 

of the class is going to have to examine the medical 

records to see whether their cholesterol came down, 

whether they suffered any side effects, and -- and if 

their cholesterol didn't come down and they did suffer 

side effects, how that could be linked to a violation of 

the Consumer Fraud Act.

 So what Judge -- Judge Davis didn't depart 

from Rezulin at all. Judge Davis said: This goes to 

core questions of liability, and as I interpret the West 

Virginia statute, in order to establish liability, 

they're going to have to show that on an 

individual-by-individual basis.

 And the relevance of White is that he's 

correct. Of course, White even goes further and says, 

because of that, there's no cause of action under the 

West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer that 

they have claims that do not involve the consumer, 

whatever it is; that they have fraud claims and some 

other kind of claims?

 MR. BECK: A warranty claim, Your Honor.

There was also a warranty claim in the McCollins case, 

the original Federal case. Their warranty claim is no 

different, and the requirements of a warranty claim are 

no different.

 Fraud, obviously, requires individual proof 

of injury and causation. The fraud is -- I mean, the 

Consumer Fraud Act is -- is an effort to make it easier 

for plaintiffs to make out a cause of action. If you 

can't make out a cause of action under the Consumer 

Fraud Act, it certainly can't be made out under fraud.

 And in terms of preclusion law, what the 

Eighth Circuit observed was that when there's the -- the 

same core set of facts that make out a cause of action, 

adding another label to it doesn't change the preclusion 

analysis.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Beck, if you're right 

about issue preclusion, then if Bayer had gone into the 

West Virginia court and said, West Virginia court, Judge 

Davis has decided this case in Minnesota Federal 

District Court -- issue preclusion -- that's one thing, 

but what was used here was quite a heavy gun, and that 

is the -- an empty suit injunction, which seems to say: 

We're not going to trust the West Virginia court to 

apply issue preclusion. We're going to stop that court 

from proceeding altogether.

And the anti-suit injunction is -- it's a 

very strong weapon, and even though it's the -- the 

clients who are being precluded, it's really saying to 

another court: We're not even going to let you get to 

this question; we're going to stop you.

 So maybe you could be right about preclusion 

but wrong about use of the anti-suit injunction.

 MR. BECK: Well, Your Honor, the -- any time 

that someone invokes the re-litigation exception to the 

Anti-Injunction Act, by definition, an alternative would 

be to go into the second court and -- and just simply 

plead preclusion. That would always be available. And 

if that were sufficient, then there would be no 

re-litigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act.

 Here's a reason why it's very important in a 

case like this: Under their theory, they -- they could 

not only file a class action in one county in West 

Virginia, and then if we couldn't get an injunction but 

we pled preclusion, and if -- and if we prevailed, they 

could file one in another county. And in West Virginia, 

county judges don't look to judges from other counties 

as stare decisis.

 And so they could go, under their approach, 

to another county, and that judge might agree with us. 

And then they go to another county, and eventually

they're pretty confident that they'd find one judge in 

one county in West Virginia who would reject our 

preclusion analysis and allow the case to go forward. 

And in West Virginia, we have no right to have an appeal 

heard. There is no intermediate appellate court, and 

there's no appeal of right to the West Virginia Supreme 

Court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, you're 

arguing the principle. What would have happened if the 

class had gone -- those who wanted to be in the class 

had gone first to the West Virginia court, and the West 

Virginia court had denied class certification? Would 

that preclude a later Federal court from granting class 

certification?

 MR. BECK: If the -- if the West Virginia 

court had denied class certification on an issue that is 

present in Rule 23, then it would be preclusive under 

Rule 23. It would be under the full faith and credit 

statute, where Federal courts have to give full faith 

and credit to State judgments to the same extent that -­

that a State would.

 If, however, Your Honor, the court said in 

West Virginia, well, they meet all of the requirements 

of our Rule 23, but under West Virginia law, we have 

discretion to deny a class even if they meet all the

requirements of Rule 23, then that would be an 

interesting question, because under Federal procedure, 

under this Court's opinions, if someone meets all the 

requirements of Rule 23, then class certification is 

appropriate.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Beck, the re-litigation 

exception of the Anti-Injunction Act speaks in terms of 

judgments. Why is the denial of class certification a 

judgment?

 MR. BECK: I'm not sure that it would be 

in -- in the mine-run case, but we don't have it. We -­

one of the reasons that this case is unusual is that we 

actually have a real-life final judgment that 

incorporates the denial of class certification.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But the judgment, if I 

understood it correctly -- there was just a 

contemporaneous summary judgment motion, and the court 

granted summary judgment as well. But the denial of 

class certification isn't responsible for the judge's 

dismissal of the suit.

 MR. BECK: Well, but it is -- it is merged 

into the judgment. It's explicitly a part of the 

judgment. It's in the judgment itself. I think it's 

our Joint Appendix 83, is it?

contingent answer to my question. If that were not the 

case, if it -- if it was the denial of a class 

certification, but then the action proceeds as a 

non-class litigation, you think that there would be no 

judgment, and so the Anti-Injunction Act would not 

apply?

 MR. BECK: No, Your Honor. I think that 

would be a tougher question. It's posed in some of the 

other cases percolating up, the Thorogood case, for 

example, or some of them out of the Seventh Circuit.

 I think that, under normal preclusion 

analysis, decisions that have not reached the point 

where there's a formal final judgment can still be given 

preclusive effect if they're sufficiently final, that a 

court says it's exceedingly unlikely that we could 

reconsider. There's another -­

MR. BECK: And I was about to say, Your 

Honor, that -- that under the Anti-Injunction Act, it 

might actually be a different analysis, and because the 

issue isn't present here, we haven't briefed it, but I 

could see under the -- looking at the statutory language 

of the re-litigation exception that talks about 

judgments and also looking to the federalism concerns 

that -- that inform the -- the Anti-Injunction Act, one 

could argue, in an appropriate case, that whatever the 

law is as to preclusion generally, when it comes to the 

Anti-Injunction Act, we're going to require more in the 

form of a -- of a formal judgment that -- that 

incorporates the particular ruling. As I said, that's 

not our case, but I could -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Oh, but why isn't it really, 

because here what happened was that there was a denial 

of class certification and there was a granting of a 

summary judgment motion at one and the same time? But 

the thing that was responsible for getting the case out 

of court was the granting of the summary judgment 

motion, not the denial of class certification. That was 

extraneous to the judgment that the case was dismissed.

 MR. BECK: Well, I think it's actually -­

while -- while it was collateral to the summary judgment 

motion on Mr. McCollins's individual claim, it's

actually essential to the judgment in -- in terms of 

including it, in terms of who's bound by -- by -- by the 

judgment. If class certification had been -- we -- we 

need to know once the judge has ruled on class 

certification, whether he's granted it or denied it, in 

order to know who's affected by the judgment on the 

merits and otherwise.

 And if he had granted the motion to certify 

the class, then there would be one set of effects coming 

out of a final judgment. If he denies the motion to 

certify the class, there's a different set of effects 

that come out of that judgment.

 So, it is essential to the judgment, in our 

mind, and, incidentally, the essential-to-the-judgment 

point under preclusion law is not one that -- that the 

Petitioners have ever raised below. It's not one that 

is in their questions presented or their cert petition 

or their brief. So this isn't an issue that -- that 

they've preserved or argued, but we do believe, quite 

clearly, that the class certification denial was an 

integral part of the final judgment, and -- and, 

obviously, it's in there on its terms.

class proceedings across the United States? Could a 

court just order a re-litigation bar?

 MR. BECK: I don't believe so, Your Honor. 

I think that -- I think that in this Court's Chick Kam 

Choo decision, there was an emphasis that under the 

Anti-Injunction Act you have to have, you know, the same 

issue litigated, and there was a concern about whether 

there was a significant difference in standards.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's my question to 

you.

 MR. BECK: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So articulate what we're 

comparing when we're saying that the re-litigation bar 

can apply to a procedural ruling.

 MR. BECK: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We started a little bit 

on the question. Is there any requirement that that 

issue have been fully and fairly adjudicated in the 

prior proceedings?

 MR. BECK: Oh, I think -- I think that for 

the -- for -- for preclusion to apply, even before one 

gets to the Anti-Injunction Act, there's a requirement 

that the issue be fully and fairly litigated. I think 

that -- I think the focus would be, as Judge Davis's 

was, is there a difference in -- in the class

that fact. And the district court's ruling here was 

based on a reliance requirement and said no predominance 

because each individual plaintiff will have to prove 

reliance. Does that become the same -- a different 

standard or not?

 MR. BECK: Judge Davis's opinion was not 

based in any way on reliance.

 MR. BECK: I think -- I think, Justice 

Sotomayor, that you have to distinguish between Rule 23 

and the underlying State law that's the subject of the 

lawsuit. And any time a -- a Federal court is looking 

at whether a class action can be certified for a 

violation of State law, it has to make a determination 

of whether -- of what State law is in terms of how you 

prove a violation, what the elements are. And that's 

what -- that's just -- you have to do that every single 

day.

 And you make that kind of determination, and 

then you move to the next step of whether that should be 

preclusive, which is when Rule 23 comes into play. And 

I think that's the point where you say, are the State 

standards under Rule 23 different from the Federal 

standards?

 What's your response to that? You cannot

that the absent parties were adequately represented.

part of Rule 23 analysis, but it's also independently a 

part of preclusion law analysis, where in order to be 

precluded -- for a nonparty to be precluded, then you 

have to do the analysis that's called for in Taylor v. 

Sturgell, where you have to say in order to preclude a 

nonparty, does it meet the two-part test of Taylor v. 

Sturgell?

 The first part: Were their interests 

aligned? Here their interests were perfectly aligned. 

And then the second part is an either/or: Did the party 

in the first action understand herself -- in this case 

himself -- to be acting in a representative capacity, or 

did the court take care to protect the interests of the 

nonparties?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a very 

subjective decision whether the lawyer is -- right here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- whether the -­

the lawyer is adequate or not. People have different 

views about what kind of lawyer they want, and I can see 

somebody who doesn't even know that this action is going 

on saying: Well, I don't care if you think the lawyer 

is adequate. I don't think he is. Besides I wanted my, 

you know, brother-in-law to be the lawyer.

case there's a -- there's a question about adequacy, and 

it focuses not on whether someone likes the lawyer or 

they've got a brother-in-law who is a lawyer. It 

focuses on whether the parties' interests are aligned, 

and McCollins's interests were identical to Mr. Smith's 

and Ms. Sperlazza's. And it -- and it points to whether 

Mr. McCollins understood that he was acting in a 

representative capacity and to whether Judge Davis took 

care to protect the interests of nonparties.

 So it doesn't say that everybody gets to 

pick their own lawyer. If that were the rule, there 

would be no law of preclusion because nobody would ever 

pick the same lawyers.

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it -- I'm sorry.

point is the basic principle that you're entitled to

entitled to your day in court if somebody else had a day 

in court and they had a good lawyer.

JUSTICE SCALIA: He tried to act in a -- but 

-- but his representation was denied.

 MR. BECK: It's the party rather than the 

lawyer, and -- and it's when -- when he commenced that 

litigation and when he litigated the issue that we're 

talking about, of class certification, there's no doubt 

in the world that he is -- that he understood himself to 

be acting on behalf of a class. That -- that's why he 

was litigating class certification.

 And -- and, Your Honor, what we -- we have 

here also, because we're -- we're kind of verging into 

the due process analysis, you have to start with the 

question of what is the interest that's at stake here. 

The injunction doesn't forbid any -- any plaintiff from 

pursuing their individual claim or arguing anything they 

want about underlying West Virginia law. It only 

precludes them from going forward in a class action, and

 MR. BECK: These I don't think fall in that 

category, Your Honor. There's -- it's $200 statutory 

penalty per violation, which means per prescription 

refill. There's -- there's attorney's fees on top of 

that; there's punitive damages on top of that. The 

McCollins case in Federal court was that kind of case, 

and he pled that he satisfied the jurisdictional amount 

of $75,000. But even if it's a small claim, the -- that

absent class members.

 Moreover, in cases talking about adequate 

representation, such as Hansberry v. Lee and the 

Richards case, one of the things this Court noted was 

that normally you have a judgment that indicates who it 

purports to bind. There's nothing in the district 

court's initial judgment indicating that the absent 

class members are bound by the denial of class 

certification, nothing whatsoever.

 In Devlin v. Scardelletti, which they say 

supports their opinion, clearly it supports our 

position, because that was a case dealing with a 

certified class settlement, where there was objections. 

And because the objections were made and overruled, this 

Court noted that those people could appeal directly 

without having to intervene in that case. And -­

which the Eighth Circuit relied on in this case,

then our individual claims still existing, consisted 

sufficient due process. But, one, we had no notice, so 

how can we appeal anything if we don't know it exists? 

And this Court has noted that in many cases, in Mullane 

and Richards and throughout, that if you have no notice 

of a matter, how can you ever have an opportunity to be 

heard, because you don't know about it?

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But just on notice, does 

the record show when the client first came to the

 MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, our case was filed 

in September 2001. The McCollins case was filed in 

August 2001, and nobody knew about the other one at all. 

I mean, these cases were filed almost the same time, 

less -- less than a month apart in different counties, 

different attorneys, different named plaintiffs.

 I did want to note in Devlin v. 

Scardelletti, Justice Scalia noted in his dissent that 

not even petitioners were advancing "the novel and 

surely erroneous argument" that absent class members 

were considered parties before class certification.

other's cases? Is that borne out? I mean, is that an 

issue?

 MR. MONAHAN: Your Honor, we've argued that 

throughout. We knew nothing about it. And see, the MDL 

proceeding -- we had, like, one or two cases that were 

filed, individual actions where the plaintiffs did not 

want to seek class action status, and those got removed 

to Federal court and transferred. The MDL court 

provides notice of the orders affecting all cases in 

general and then provides you with orders in your own 

case. You do not get orders about other individual 

cases. So we never knew about McCollins when it was 

seeking class certification.

 I would note that the White case here in no 

-- no way vindicates the district court. The White case 

did say that reliance did not have to be proven if you 

have fraudulent concealment or suppression. Rather, the 

standard is all you have to do is you have to show: 

Would an objectively reasonable person have bought the 

product had they known all of the information that was 

concealed and suppressed? And, clearly, that can be 

dealt with on a common basis.

 But a confusing aspect here, it seems like 

many people try to argue that for class actions that you 

have to have all common issues or else you can't have
