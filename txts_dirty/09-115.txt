 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next this morning in Case 09-115, Chamber of 

Commerce v. Whiting.

 Mr. Phillips.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 In 1986, Congress converted what had been 

before that time a merely peripheral concern of 

immigration policy -- that is, how to regulate worker 

authorization -- and converted it into a core concern of 

immigration policy by the passage of the -- of the 

Immigration Reform and Control Act.

 This Court has characterized that change in 

legislation as providing a comprehensive scheme for 

dealing with those issues, and that characterization is 

obviously apt because Congress provided for an 

exhaustive and exclusively Federal method of bringing to 

the attention of Federal authorities problems in worker 

authorization, the method by which those matters should 

be investigated, the method by which they should be 

adjudicated, all of which are controlled as a matter of

Federal -- exclusive Federal activity; and, indeed, the 

ultimate judicial review goes exclusively to the Federal 

courts of appeals.

 The sanctioning provisions are very explicit 

and they're very clear and they are very balanced; and 

for a good reason. Congress realized in this context 

that if you over-enforce in one direction -- that is, if 

you try to deter the hiring of unauthorized workers -­

you run a very serious risk of causing employers to err 

on the side of not hiring others who are in fact 

authorized but who may fall into protected classes. And 

so Congress very carefully calibrated the penalties on 

both sides so that the employer essentially would play 

it straight down the middle and hire the best people for 

the job under these circumstances, while, of course, 

complying if at all possible with the Federal 

requirements.

 And so it's against that backdrop -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why is that a 

problem if, as -- as the Federal statute requires and 

the State statutes require, you have to show an intent 

to hire an unauthorized worker? Isn't -- isn't that 

what the State statutes here require?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the State statute has 

two components to it. One is knowing and one is intent.

JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so why is that a 

problem for -- for the business? I mean he's safe so 

long as he doesn't intentionally hire an unauthorized 

worker.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think part of the 

problem is that there -- it is never 100 percent clear 

precisely who is and who is not an authorized worker. 

And I think what Congress said was -- I'm not going to 

deal with this problem in the kind of granular way 

you're looking at it, Justice Scalia, which is 

specifically at each of the individual employment 

decisions. I'm going to look at the generality of 

situations, and realize that if you put in -- on one 

side of the scale what Arizona has done here, which is 

to say you can -- you can essentially have the death 

penalty to the business, that is, complete eliminate the 

business's right to exist, and, on the other side of the 

scale, a $250 fine, it would -- it would be pretty 

remarkable to say, well, I -- you know, I'm going to 

hide behind the intent and knowing requirements and, 

instead, simply avoid if at all possible the risk of 

Arizona's sanctions being imposed upon me.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think what Arizona 

would answer to that is: Well, that's the only option 

the Federal Government left us.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I'm quite sure that 

that's what Arizona will say.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They excluded everything 

else. We might have used reticulated penalties or, you 

know, enforced the Federal law ourselves, but they 

forbade that. But they did allow us to enforce the law, 

immigration laws, through licensing, right? So it all 

essentially comes down to -- to the licensing issue, 

doesn't it?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. It does ultimately 

does come down to the "through licensing" laws and -­

the -- the part of the -- and the fundamental problem, 

obviously, with Arizona's scheme here is that this is 

not a licensing law. This is a worker authorization 

sanctioning law.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, when I picked up 

this -- this brief and looked at this case, I thought: 

Oh, well, licensing, that's a defined term; I'll look in 

Corpus Juris Secundum or ALR or something. But it 

really isn't. Your brief indicates you start with 

dictionaries, fair enough. You indicate what Federal 

licensing laws are. But I see no limitation on what the

State can decide is a license in any jurisprudential 

principle that you've cited.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Justice Kennedy, I 

think the better way to try to -- to grapple with the 

meaning of the licensing law or whether it ought to be 

construed broadly to allow the State wide authority to 

engage in supplemental enforcement in this, or narrowly 

in order to say that what really ought to happen in this 

context is, if you deal with a situation where the 

Federal Government has enacted -- I'm sorry -- has 

enforced a provision and imposed a penalty through the 

Federal scheme, that then as a supplement to that the 

State does in fact have the authority to add something 

over and above what it -- what the Federal Government 

has done.

 But it seems to me quite remarkable to think 

that Congress intended through a parenthetical referring 

to "through licensing laws" to allow the State to adopt 

an entire alternative shadow enforcement mechanism, a 

non-administrative decision-making process, completely a 

State-run operation; and even at the end, the sanction 

is not -- is not imposed ultimately in effect by the -­

by any regulating entity. It is ordered by a State 

court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That would be possible only

because nobody would think that, with this scheme in 

place, the Federal Government would not enforce it. Of 

course, no one would have expected that. But what 

Arizona says has occurred here is that the scheme in 

place has not been enforced, and Arizona and other 

States are in serious trouble financially and for other 

reasons because of -- of unrestrained immigration. And, 

therefore, they had to take this very massive -- I agree 

this step is massive, and one wouldn't have expected it 

to occur under this statute, but expectations change 

when the Federal Government has -- has simply not 

enforced the immigration restrictions.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia, I -- I 

understand the point, and I understand the motivation 

for why Arizona did what it did. But the -- the problem 

is the statute was enacted in 1986, and that's when the 

pre-emption standards were put in place. And the -­

again, the notion -- if you look at the way the 

structure of the statute -- and this also responds in 

some ways to Justice Kennedy's question about how should 

you read licensing, since it's not a self-defining 

concept -- is if you -- is that, first, Congress said 

very specifically that the immigration laws should be 

enforced uniformly, which says that there shouldn't be 

40,000 different localities offering up their view of

licensing and -- and the additional 50 States.

 Second of all, and this part I think is 

particularly telling in terms of this massive State 

scheme that's been adopted, which is that under section 

1324a(b)(5), which is in 134a of the -- of the appendix, 

Congress specifically outlaws the use of the I-9 form. 

And in some ways this goes to your question, 

Justice Scalia, because it would be inconceivable that 

the State can in fact enforce knowing and intentional 

decision making without having access to the I-9 form, 

because that's -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this 

question to get back -­

MR. PHILLIPS: Sure.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- to the issue of whether 

this is a licensing law? "Licensing" is not an unknown 

term. States and municipalities issue all sorts of 

licenses. For example, I think here in the District of 

Columbia every business has to have a general business 

license; isn't that right?

 MR. PHILLIPS: That is true, Justice Alito.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, if the District of 

Columbia were -- after having enacted this requirement 

some years ago, were to pass a new ordinance saying "and 

if you knowingly hire an illegal alien, your general

business license can be forfeited," would that not -­

would that cease to be a licensing law?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I think the answer 

to that specific hypothetical is that's still not a 

licensing law, because it doesn't tie the grant of the 

license to the revocation powers. I think Congress -- I 

think Congress means for the States to adopt something 

more specific than that, although I do think 

eventually -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why is it -- this is 

the same question you're answering. Why is it suddenly 

not a license because the -- because the State imposes 

an additional condition, where it was a license before?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -­

MR. PHILLIPS: I think the question is 

whether it is a licensing law within the meaning of what 

Congress intended. I mean -- the -- the reality is, 

Justice Alito, there -- there is no common definition of 

"license," and various States and local -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Actually, there is. I

little familiar, and I think whoever wrote it in Arizona 

copied it out of the Administrative Procedure Act. I

MR. PHILLIPS: But -­

JUSTICE BREYER: -- and this is awfully

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I understand that, 

Justice Breyer, and I agree with that. But the problem 

is, is that the -- the Federal law, it doesn't talk 

about actions with -- with respect to licenses. It 

talks about licensing laws and -­

JUSTICE BREYER: That's right. It might 

have meant something different; Congress might have. 

But what is, then -- I read the SEIU brief. I thought 

that was pretty interesting. Is that something you 

adopt as what the Congress did mean? I mean, what do 

you think Congress did mean, and what evidence is 

there -- if it didn't mean the APA definition, what 

evidence is there for that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the SEIU brief does a 

very nice job of explaining the -- the particular focus 

of Congress, obviously, on the -- on the Agricultural 

Workers Protection Act, and in particular -- which, you 

know, has tremendous significance in terms of narrowing 

the State's authority here, because, obviously, in their 

conforming amendments in that context -­

 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It could have named that, 

that particular licensing scheme, if that's what it 

meant. But it didn't name it; it said licensing 

generally.

 What did it intend to add to that? Barbers' 

licenses?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I think what -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Beauticians' licenses?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Of course.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How would any of this have 

anything to do with the immigration laws?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think what it -- what 

Congress actually had in mind and what's the most 

natural reading of a licensing law is the fairly common 

situation where somebody violates Federal law, usually 

on the criminal side, and a State licensing entity finds 

out about a conviction of a Federal crime, and says: 

Oh, wait a second, we don't want people to have licenses 

under these circumstances, and, therefore, they -­

and what they're saying.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's very common to 

talk about authority to do business within a State as -­

as a license. You say "licensed to do business in" so 

many States. It's a common expression.

 Now, I have -- maybe you'll persuade me 

otherwise, but I have no doubt that insofar as this law 

limits the authority to do business within the State, it 

is a -- it is a licensing law. It's a little harder 

extending licensing to formation of a corporation, but 

when you issue a corporation charter you really do two 

things. You create the corporation and enable the 

limitation of liability that creates, and secondly, you 

authorize that new creature to do business within your 

State. So at least half of that corporation law is 

licensing, it seems to me.

 Now, if that's what I think, what -­

MR. PHILLIPS: Actually, Justice Scalia, can 

I stop you there?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Go on.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Because I think, actually, if 

you just -- if you just receive the articles of 

incorporation, that doesn't actually in all States 

necessarily give you the opportunity to do business. It 

just simply gives you the right to exist, and you may

very well need to get a separate document in order to 

actually do business in a particular State.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- but you do not need 

the kind of a document that an out-of-State corporation 

needs -­

MR. PHILLIPS: No, you don't need that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you're an in-State 

corporation.

 Mr. PHILLIPS: That's true. That's true. 

But the -- but the reality is that nobody, I think -­

and common sense and common use of the term, thinks of 

articles of incorporation or the charter of a 

partnership or any of those as -- documents as 

licensing, which suggests that the State -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I -- could I -­

MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- just -- just focus 

the questioning? Because we keep talking about whether 

the APA-type definition of licensing is what Congress 

intended or not, but you don't disagree that Congress at 

least intended that if someone violated the Federal law 

and hired illegal aliens and was -- undocumented aliens 

and was found to have violated it, that the State can 

revoke their license, correct?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it really doesn't 

matter whether they're revoking their right to do 

business in the State. And they can only revoke their 

charter or their articles of incorporation if they're -­

if they were filed in that State. They wouldn't have 

power to revoke a Delaware -­

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. They can't do it -­

they can't do it to Delaware, right.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So it's 

stopping them from doing business. So really the only 

conflict you're talking about is not the power to stop 

them from doing business, because you accept that this 

saving clause gives them the power to do that, to revoke 

the right to do business; what you're talking about is a 

conflict in the adjudication of that issue.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because that is, for me, 

what the center of this question is.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I think there are 

three pieces of evidence that respond directly to what 

you asked, Justice Sotomayor.

 First is Congress, in section 115 of the 

statute, specifically says enforcement should be 

uniform, which suggests to me that this ought to be 

exclusively a Federal investigation and -- and 

adjudication process.

 Two, the point I was making earlier about 

the I-9 form. Those forms cannot be used in any 

location -­

immigration laws shall be uniform. Congress stated that

115.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- from what is the assumed 

situation with respect to all Federal laws?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, not necessarily.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are Federal laws not to be 

applied uniformly.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, I -- I mean, I 

think it depends on the circumstances. I can imagine a 

lot of -- I mean, this is -- remember, we're talking 

about immigration policy and immigration law here, and 

in general, you would expect that to be pretty much 

uniform. But this Court in De Canas had decided that 

there are some elements of it that were not, and 

Congress is simply reinforcing the basic notion that 

enforcement of it ought to be uniform to -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't the exception for 

licensing mean that this isn't going to be completely 

uniform? One -- one jurisdiction may take the position 

that a restaurant that employs illegal aliens may lose 

its restaurant -- its license to operate. Another one

sanction done by the Federal Government and then just an 

add-on on the licensing side, rather than an entire 

regime to enforce State law.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this is -- it can't 

be uniformity of sanction, because the court permitted 

licensing sanctions.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, there -- but only at 

that point.

question of adjudication. What you're saying is what's 

specifically pre-empted is the right to adjudicate -­

of Labor.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING PETITIONERS

 GENERAL KATYAL: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 Nearly a quarter of a century ago, Congress 

declared Federal employer sanctions central, not 

peripheral, to the policy of immigration law. Congress 

broadly swept away State and local laws, pre-empting any 

sanction upon those who employ unauthorized aliens, with 

the sole exception being a mere parenthetical for 

licensing and similar laws.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to pose there, 

we've had a little discussion about what licensing laws

are, but we haven't talked at all about those last two 

words, "and similar laws." It seems to me that whatever 

wiggle room or ambiguity there may be in saying whether 

this is a license or not, Congress swept pretty broadly. 

It said, not just licensing laws, but licensing and 

similar laws.

 GENERAL KATYAL: First let me tell you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, what we think a licensing law is and 

then deal with the "similar" question.

 We think a licensing law, as Congress 

defined it in IRCA, was the traditional licensing laws 

that were in place in 1986. Those were largely farm 

labor contractor laws. They were aimed at fitness to do 

business, and they had a few essential characteristics 

in those laws. They -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Let me 

just -- I mean, businesses had to have licensing laws 

pretty much across the board, right? You couldn't set 

up a -- I don't know -- an electrical contracting 

business if you didn't -- weren't licensed to do 

business or met the requirements for an electrician. It 

wasn't just agricultural work.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Oh, absolutely. And -- but 

I think that this licensing law looks very different 

from the ones you were referring to or the farm labor

contractor ones, for a number of reasons. The first is 

licensing laws issue licenses. They're generally about 

the issuance of licenses, not simply ones in which 

licenses are revoked. Second, they are ones in which 

the issuance of the license, the criteria for issuance, 

is the same as the criteria for revocation, because 

they're -­

of characteristics. Now, we can debate about whether 

subtracting one or another of those characteristics -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Once you're in, you can do 

whatever you like. Do you think that is what Congress 

meant? You can -- you can pass upon their fitness when 

you issue the license, but once its issued, they can do 

whatever they like; is that right?

 GENERAL KATYAL: No. I think that the 

criteria would be the same for issuance and revocation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And revocation. Okay. So 

that raises the question: What does it make -- why does 

it make any difference if the revocation provision is 

contained in the narrow licensing law or if there's a 

general State law which says all licenses that -- that 

are issued may be revoked for certain reasons?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Because, Justice Scalia, 

what Congress was trying to do was preserve the States' 

and localities' traditional power for fitness to do 

business. And one good indicia that fitness to do 

business is not was what at issue in the particular law 

is that they will let businesses operate, they will 

license them without any care whatsoever as to whether 

they have a history of violating the particular 

provisions -­

 GENERAL KATYAL: A State could certainly 

make that part of its genuine fitness to do business 

law. Now, here Arizona hasn't done that. And we know 

that because the criteria for issuance of the license 

are entirely divorced from the criteria for revocation 

of the license. And if Arizona really believed, 

Mr. Chief Justice, what you're saying, which is that 

it's relevant to the -- the violation is relevant to 

whether they can do business or not, they allow every 

single one of these entities to get the license.

the purpose is to regulate undocumented aliens, then

Federal violation is expressly pre-empted as well as 

impliedly so for three reasons. The first is that 

Congress, in developing IRCA and the comprehensive 

scheme, set out a series of procedures, Federal 

adjudication with an ALJ, all sorts of different 

regulations to the jot and tittle. And what Arizona

but many State laws existed that independently 

adjudicated revocations. What in the legislative 

history or in the words of the statute show that 

Congress intended in any way to limit those 

adjudications?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, it's undoubtedly the 

case that without the parenthetical, the mere 

parenthetical savings clause, that Arizona-like laws 

would be swept away as sanctions, that these are 

sanctions imposed. So the question is whether the 

licensing law phrase saves that. And I think it saves 

the Federal -- State adjudication, and I think the 

answer to that is no, because to read the statute that 

way is to permit all of those States to have their own 

laws, and it's undoubtedly the case that Congress wanted 

to sweep away the De Canas-style State statutes that 

were in place that imposed sanctions on employers. And

license to do business, and then it became aware of a 

problem it wasn't aware of before -- it found out that a 

lot of employers were employing child labor, and they 

didn't know they would do that -- and they say we can 

revoke your license if you're determined to have 

employed child labor; that that would not be okay?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it would be okay 

if, in the original licensing thing, they said "and you 

can't employ child labor"?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think that the 

answer depends on what Congress was trying to get at. 

In 1986, we know what Congress was trying to get at with 

respect to State enforcement of immigration laws. They 

broadly swept away the De Canas-style laws, and they 

said, for the I-9 provision, which President Reagan 

described as the keystone of the Act, that I-9 documents 

can't be used in any procedure besides IRCA procedures.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Chief Justice -­

the Chief Justice can insist on the answer to his own 

question, but it seems to me his question is why isn't 

that still a licensing law?

adjudication, it is swept away by the first parts of the

example, why isn't that a -- an addition to a regulatory

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY R. O'GRADY

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. O'GRADY: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,

 Through their police powers, States 

traditionally have the authority to regulate the conduct 

of employers within their jurisdiction to determine what 

conduct warrants issuance of a State license and to 

determine what conduct justifies suspending or revoking 

such a license. And although Congress pre-empted some 

of our traditional authority when it enacted IRCA in 

1986, it preserved significant State authority through

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer the -­

the anomaly that Arizona cannot impose a fine even in a 

modest amount, but it can revoke someone's license to do 

business?

 MS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, we think that 

looking at the savings clause -- we don't view it as an 

anomaly. The structure that Congress established is one 

that the State's authority is determined by the nature 

of the sanction that we choose to impose. We don't have 

the authority to -- they -- they took away our authority 

to impose civil monetary and criminal sanctions but 

preserved our authority to impose sanctions through a 

similar law.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But underlying Justice 

Ginsburg's question is why would Congress want to do 

that?

 MS. O'GRADY: Well, I think it makes sense, 

Your Honor, because in terms of licensing, it -- it

Congress was recognizing what this Court recognized in 

De Canas, was that unauthorized employment has 

significant local consequences, so they did not want to

authority -­

JUSTICE BREYER: The main -- the main 

anomaly seemed to me to be this, that in the Federal 

Act, as -- that was the first point that the Chamber 

made, that it's a fairly careful balance. There are a 

group of people in Arizona, they may look as if they 

come from Mexico or speak with an Hispanic accent, and 

you're not certain whether they in fact are illegals or 

that they're legal. Now, think of that category.

Congress has passed a statute that gives the 

employer just as much incentive to verify, so there's no 

discrimination, as to dismiss, so there's no illegal 

hiring. It's absolutely balanced. A $1,000 fine for 

the one, a $1,000 fine for the other.

 So Arizona comes along and says: I'll tell 

you what, if you discriminate, you know what happens to 

you? Nothing. But if you hire an illegal immigrant, 

your business is dead.

 That's just one thing they do. Now, how can 

you reconcile that intent to prevent discrimination 

against people because of their appearance or accent -­

how do you reconcile that with Arizona's law?

 If you're a businessman, every incentive 

under that law is to call close questions against hiring 

this person. Under the Federal law, every incentive is 

to look at it carefully.

 MS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, a couple of 

points. First, in terms of how our law works, we do 

have a prohibition against investigating any complaint 

that's based solely on race. So if we get a complaint 

that says those people all look Mexican or Hispanic, 

that does not get investigated under Arizona law, first. 

We also have criminal penalties if frivolous complaints 

are filed.

Beyond that, we have the use of E-Verify, 

which is an added protection for employers to prevent 

the hiring of unauthorized aliens. So if they use 

E-Verify, if they're in good-faith compliance with the 

I-9 process, they have no risk of exposure under Arizona 

law, just as true under Federal law.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm -- doesn't it 

frustrate the congressional intent when the Federal law 

says that the I-9 can be used for no purpose other than 

the Federal adjudication of whether a violation has 

occurred or not? Doesn't it frustrate that law to have 

the States raise a defense that depends on forcing 

someone to disclose something that the Federal law 

protects?

 I mean, this is a vicious circle. Federal 

law says you can't do the I-9 for -- you can't use it 

for any purpose other than the Federal adjudication. 

Now you're creating a defense that says you have to 

supply us with something that Federal law otherwise 

protects from disclosure.

 MS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, we don't think 

that the Federal law prohibits the use of an I-9 -- of 

the I-9 -- an employer's use of the I-9 in a State 

proceeding, that these can be used under the Federal 

proceeding or under the State.

form.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That doesn't answer my

Federal law says that I-9 can be used for no purpose 

other than the Federal adjudication of the status of 

employees? I think that's -­

enforcement of this chapter. And we believe that 

a State enforcement action, under the authority for 

preserving sanctions through licensing and similar laws, 

would fall within that. So we think they should be able 

to use that; the employer should be able to use that.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there -- isn't there a 

difference between saying it may not be used for any 

purpose other than for enforcement of this chapter and 

other provisions of Federal law, on the one hand, and

And I was worried about the E review which it seemed to 

require because it seemed to me in 20 percent of the 

cases where the notice is this guy is not authorized; we 

don't have any record that he's authorized to work -- 20 

percent of those are wrong, and he is authorized to 

work.

 So the employer who follows that is really 

going to fire 20 percent of the people who will be 

absolutely entitled to work. And so I'd just like you

to address those points, as you wish.

 MS. O'GRADY: Okay. And let me walk through 

how our law works to see if this addresses the concern. 

So the -- Arizona doesn't change anything in terms of 

the use of the I-9. We retain the same defense that's 

in the Federal law for good-faith compliance with the 

I-9. We do require employers to use E-Verify, although 

we don't impose a sanction on that employer if they 

don't use E-Verify.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you explain that, 

E-Verify, because this is a Federal resource, and the 

Federal Government has said we want this to be 

voluntary. How can Arizona take a Federal resource, 

which the Federal Government says is voluntary except in 

certain circumstances, and turn it into something that's 

mandatory?

 MS. O'GRADY: We think the -- that question 

is answered by looking at -- into the conflict 

pre-emption analysis, because Congress didn't address 

the role of the States with regard to E-Verify. And we 

aren't -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't -- I don't get 

into any pre-emption or not, but it's -- Arizona wants 

to use a Federal resource. And the Fed makes it 

available if the employer can use it voluntarily, but

not mandatorily. How can -- how can Arizona set the 

rules on the use of a Federal resource?

 MS. O'GRADY: Your Honor, we can -- as long 

as it's not a burden to the objectives of Congress, we 

think that we can require employers within our 

jurisdiction to use E-Verify.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do you make it 

mandatory?

 MS. O'GRADY: Well, our statute says you 

shall use E-Verify. We don't impose a penalty against 

employers who fail to use it. The consequences are the 

same as they are under Federal law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You just -- you just don't 

get the safe harbor. Isn't that the only consequence?

 MS. O'GRADY: That's right. You don't get 

the safe harbor under E-Verify. Now -- for the use of 

E-Verify. We did add after this lawsuit was filed some 

additional requirements similar to what they have under 

the Federal system, where you can't get State contracts, 

you can't get State grants.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you are taking the 

mechanism that Congress said will be a pilot program 

that is optional, and you are making it mandatory. It 

seems to me that's almost a classic example of a State

test for conflict pre-emption in terms of, does this 

make it impossible to comply with Federal law? No, it's 

really a question of are we interfering with 

Congress's -- excuse me -- the Federal Government's 

ability to achieve its goals? And the goal in 

developing E-Verify is to have a more effective 

verification system.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If they fail to do it, then 

they cannot receive any, quote, "grant, loan, or 

performance-based incentive," end quote, from the State. 

That's what the law says, isn't it?

 MS. O'GRADY: That's what -- and that was 

added after this lawsuit was filed.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. I would think 

then the answer to Justice Scalia's question is, yes, 

there is that penalty. It isn't simply hortatory.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, in answer to 

Justice Breyer's earlier question, in fact, relying on 

the I-9 does not provide a safe harbor, because under 

the E-Verify system, you can't just rely on the I-9 

forms and statutes; you have to rely on the E-Verify.

 MS. O'GRADY: Well, Your Honor, we have the 

same -- it's modeled after the Federal law. So, just as 

Federal law has a defense for employers who in good 

faith follow I-9, so does the State law. I -­

JUSTICE ALITO: The Federal law and the

employer does is receive the forms from the employee, 

from the I-9 process. He looks at the forms. Well, 

they reasonably seem to be authentic. So that employer 

now has the good-faith defense that's provided under -­

by the I-9 process, under both Federal law and State 

law.

 But, under both Federal law and State law, 

the employee -- employer either must or may also use the 

e-verification system. The employer gets back a notice 

of non-authorization. But what -- and that creates, 

supposedly, a rebuttable presumption under both systems 

that the employee is not authorized to work.

 How does that fit together? If you have a 

complete defense for having used the I-9 process in good 

faith, the whole e-verification process seems to be 

irrelevant under both Federal law and State law. I 

don't understand how they fit together.

 MS. O'GRADY: And, Justice Alito, we haven't 

wrestled that in practical application, and I'm not 

aware of them reaching that point under the Federal 

system, either, but -- because it does seem at some 

point, if you -- that the system should work, that if 

you have used I-9 and you get back a final 

non-confirmation, not a tentative non-confirmation, that 

that employee is unauthorized, that that, you know,

seems like it should carry greater weight in an 

enforcement action. But as a -- as an -- on an 

as-applied basis, I'm not sure how that plays out in an 

actual enforcement action.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you -- I 

wasn't quite sure what she meant. Judge Schroeder, in 

her opinion for the court, emphasized that this statute 

was being evaluated on its -- on its face and that -­

she said in as-applied, particular challenges might 

arise.

 How would that work? If we determine this 

is not pre-empted, how would -- on its face, how would 

an as-applied challenge come about?

 MS. O'GRADY: I think, Your Honor, perhaps 

if we -- perhaps in terms of what are the outer limits 

of our definition of "license" and their saying that we 

are outside the definition of licensing and similar laws 

in a particular case, perhaps that would be an 

as-applied-type challenge.

 I think some of the I-9 concerns are perhaps 

more appropriately resolved in a -- in a direct case 

where that issue has arisen on an as-applied basis, and 

I think she was concerned about some of the real 

implementation questions that were wrapped into the 

legal challenge.

from the Federal Government, that it's pre-empted?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, let -- then let me 

ask the question directly. If Arizona's system does not 

permit a employer to rely on non-suspect documents, the 

I-9 documents that are permitted employers to rely on -­

the Arizona system says, no, you can't rely on those. 

Is that pre-empted or not?

 You can't rely on I-9, or the Arizona system 

says -- on the I-9 documents. Or the Arizona system 

says you can't hire someone who hasn't been approved 

under the e-verification system. Is that pre-empted?

 MS. O'GRADY: I think those would both be 

problems. I think we need to be consistent with the -­

the structure and the obligations that are imposed under 

Federal law in terms of our sanctions provisions.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, are you -- are you 

conceding that any variation from the Federal standards 

for -- for criminal and civil liability is automatically 

precluded?

 I mean, as I read the exception, it's an 

exception for State licensing and similar laws. And it 

doesn't say "so long as those licensing and similar laws 

go no further than what the Federal Government has 

done." I mean, we often allow States to impose

regulatory requirements that go beyond the regulatory 

requirements that the Federal Government has imposed, 

and that is not automatically considered to be 

pre-empted. So why -- why are you conceding that 

Arizona cannot go a whit beyond what the Federal 

Government says?

 MS. O'GRADY: Because I think what Congress 

preserved for us was our ability to impose sanctions, 

including the suspension and revocation of State laws. 

But I do think they established a uniform national 

standard. I don't think we could, for example, 

establish a -- a strict liability offense in Arizona. 

We'd have to have a scienter requirement as they have in 

Federal law.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what I was trying to 

get is -- what I was looking at specifically is Federal 

law says, if you look at the driver's license and Social 

Security card -- those are I-9 docs -- then the employer 

has established an affirmative defense and has not 

violated the law. That's what it says. You know the 

cite -- 27a or whatever. Okay? That's the Federal law.

 Arizona law that I was reading -- maybe 

there's another place I should read -- is it says, on 

determining whether he's an unauthorized alien, the 

court -- the court shall consider the Federal

Government's determination. It creates a rebuttable 

presumption. That means it might be rebutted. Okay?

 So I see a difference there. And the reason 

that that's relevant is because, my first question, if 

you are an employer, prior to your law, it's 50/50. 

better verify because if I'm discriminating, you know, 

da, da, da. And it's not that hard. I just look at the 

driver's license and I look at -- I'm home free, and the 

Social Security card, and if I hire an illegal 

immigrant, the same thing, da, da, da. Okay? So same 

both ways.

 Your law: Employer, look at the driver's 

license and Social Security, you are not home free. 

Employer, if it turns out that you've been hiring this 

illegal immigrant and he's not an American, your 

business is finished. But what happens if I 

discriminate? Under our law? Nothing.

 Now, that was the original point they made. 

That's why I brought up this question of difference in 

standards. And I want to be absolutely clear what your 

answer to that is.

 MS. O'GRADY: And I'm hoping I am being 

clear, Justice Breyer. We have the same standards as 

Federal law. We have the same I-9 defense that's in 

Federal law.

the word "licensing" -- not everyone looks at this, but 

I did look at the legislative history. And when you 

look at that paragraph on page 39 of the red brief, it 

seems to me that that paragraph says what it means. It 

says precisely what it is. It says -- the first thing 

it says is that, look, if you're found to have violated 

this -- where is it? It's page -- there it is.

 Suppose somebody has been found to have 

violated the sanctions provision in the Federal 

legislation. Now, you've found -- he has been found by 

the Federal Government. Then what the State does, it 

can revoke his license. Okay? That's one thing. And 

the second thing it says it wants -- doesn't want to 

pre-empt "'fitness to do business laws,' such as State 

farm labor contracting laws or forestry laws." In other 

words, it's thinking of some precise set of licenses, 

and that's why this licensing thing was there. And the 

very next part of this Federal law are conforming 

amendments, and those conforming amendments apply to 

departments of government that were concerned with 

maintaining State farm labor contractor laws.

 Now, I grant you, you have to go beyond the 

text, but some of us do because we get enlightenment. 

And going beyond that text, it seems to me we should

licensing -- but let's deal with the part where you look 

at their explanation as to why they put those words 

there.

 MS. O'GRADY: Okay. First, the farm labor 

contractor is simply an example, and I think it says 

"such as" an example of the type of licensing provisions 

that existed at this time that addressed that. So 

that's not an all-inclusive universe of sanctions that 

-- of -- of all the licensing laws that might be subject 

to this. They also don't specifically say there has to 

be a prior Federal adjudication. That sentence has 

passive voice, "has been determined," without specifying 

who is making that determination, and it specifically 

refers to State and local processes that provide for the 

suspension and revocation of State licenses.

 And then the sentence goes -- then there's a

 We think this is a fitness to do business

if you engage in this conduct of knowingly employing

obligations that exist under Federal law.

 And also I wanted to address more on the 

farm labor contractors and the amendments. And what we 

think that they were doing in those amendments was 

simply dividing responsibility at the Federal level 

between the Department of Labor and their processes that 

pre-existed IRCA, and what they were establishing in 

IRCA, and said we're not going to have these 

determinations of whether they -- the farm labor 

contractor has employed an unauthorized alien through a 

Department of Labor process; we're going to instead use 

the IRCA-established process.

 But, importantly, what Congress did not 

change in the agricultural worker regulations was the 

provision that addresses State law. It said, before 

IRCA and after IRCA, that those laws -- those Federal 

laws only supplement the authority of the States and 

that means that they preserved all of the State 

authority that they had before IRCA in the area of farm 

labor contractors. And that I think is reinforced by 

the legislative history that -- that again reinforces 

that those have been preserved through IRCA.

 This is an area that has traditionally been

within the mainstream of State police power. We 

acknowledge that Congress does have the authority to 

pre-empt us, but they left important discretion in terms 

of our ability to impose sanctions through licensing and 

similar laws, and we are doing so by establishing this 

scheme that provides for the suspension and revocation 

of State licenses.

 It's an important part of the balance that 

Congress struck when it enacted IRCA by addressing what 

State authority would exist after that congressional 

enactment. We think the lower courts properly 

determined the scope of that provision.

 And unless there are further questions, I 

thank you for your attention this morning.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Phillips, you have 3 minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and, once again, may it please the Court:

 I want to begin frankly where Justice 

Sotomayor pointed me to before, which is the question of 

whether or not there really is a basis for allowing the 

States to independently investigate and to independently 

adjudicate these matters. And what is the evidence that

Congress did not intend that?

 Justice Breyer quoted from the House report, 

recognizing not everybody accepts that, but it does seem 

to me to articulate a very commonsense limitation that 

says you have to have a Federal adjudication in the 

first instance, and once you've got that, then the State 

is allowed to add that sanction.

 That -- that principle, it seems to me, is 

reinforced by the limitation on what you can use the I-9 

for. Justice Alito, you asked that question, but it 

does seem to me quite clear that what Congress 

envisioned in 1986 when it adopted this is you're going 

to have an exclusively Federal enforcement scheme 

including the adjudicatory process, and it is only in 

that context that you are allowed to use the I-9. And 

the notion that the State could adopt a standard of 

intentional or knowingly, and not be able to have the 

I-9 materials available, seems to me flatly at odds with 

each other, and, therefore, it cannot be that Congress 

intended under those circumstances to allow these 

matters to be adjudicated in that particular fashion.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What can -- Mr. Phillips, 

what can the State do that would be complementary rather 

than conflicting?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I -- it seems to me the

easiest -- and of course, this has nothing to do with 

what Arizona does -- but the easiest is, if a -- an 

employer is convicted of -- of violating IRCA and a 

criminal sanction, and he happens to be a barber, and 

the State licensing law says if you're convicted of a -­

of a Federal crime you will lose your license, it is 

available to the State under those circumstances -- and 

I think this is exactly what Congress had in mind -- to 

issue a notice to show cause why that particular person 

shouldn't have the license revoked and then go from 

there.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Convicted by -- by a 

Federal Government that hasn't gone after many 

convictions.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Scalia -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the whole problem.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no. But, 

Justice Scalia, it seems to me the whole question here 

-- and first of all, I don't think pre-emption can be a 

moving target. I think you have to decide it on a basis 

of what Congress had in front of it in 1986. But 

remember, Congress was balancing three, at least, very 

difficult problems: minimizing burdens on the 

employers, minimizing discrimination against people who 

are permitted to be hired, and avoiding hiring people

who are not permitted to do so.

 And how you properly reconcile that is very 

difficult, but the one thing that seems to me clear is 

that that was a choice Congress meant to leave to itself 

and to the Federal Government to sort out and not to 

give the States the opportunity to come in where they 

did.

 And to say one last word about E-Verify -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, except -­

well, you're just kind of blinking over the savings 

clause: except through licensing and similar laws. So 

that's not a real reservation by Congress of this power 

to itself.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, if you -- if you 

interpret the savings clause as I do, which means truly 

as a supplement to Federal -- Federal adjudication, then 

it is a very narrow limitation on that basis, because at 

that point you've already invoked the entirety of the 

Federal scheme, and it doesn't modify the balance on 

those broader legal issues, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.
