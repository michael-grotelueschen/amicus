CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will continue 

argument this afternoon in Case 11-400, Florida v. The 

Department of Health and Human Services. 

Mr. Clement. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The constitutionality of the Act's massive 

expansion of Medicaid depends on the answer to two 

related questions. First, is the expansion coercive? 

And, second, does that coercion matter? 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, can I ask you 

a -- just a matter of clarification? Would you be 

making the same argument if, instead of the Federal 

Government picking up 90 percent of the cost, the 

Federal Government picked up 100 percent of the cost? 

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Kagan, if everything 

else in the statute remained the same, I would be making 

the exact same argument. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: The exact same argument. 

So -- so, that really reduces to the question of why is 

a big gift from the Federal Government a matter of

1 coercion? In other words, the Federal Government is 

2 here saying we're giving you a boatload of money. There 

3 are no -- there's no matching funds requirement, there 

4 are no extraneous conditions attached to it, it's just a 

boatload of Federal money for you to take and spend on 

6 poor people's healthcare. It doesn't sound coercive to 

7 me, I have to tell you. 

8  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kagan, let me --

9 I mean, I eventually want to make the point where, even 

if you had a standalone program that just gave 

11 100 percent, just 100 percent boatload, nothing but boatload --

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, I mean, if you --

13  MR. CLEMENT: Why, there would still be a 

14 problem. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, you do make that argument 

16 in your brief, just a standalone program, a boatload of 

17 money, no extraneous conditions, no matching funds, is 

18 coercive? 

19  MR. CLEMENT: It is. But before I make that 

point, can I simply say that you built into your 

21 question the idea that there are no -- no conditions. 

22 And, of course, when you first asked, it was what about 

23 the same program with 100 percent matching on the newly 

24 eligible mandatory individuals, which is how the statute 

refers to them. And that would have a very big

condition. And the very big condition is that the 

States, in order to get that new money, they would have 

to agree not only to the new conditions, but the 

government here is -- the Congress is leveraging their 

entire prior participation --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Let me give you a 

hypothetical, Mr. Clement. 

MR. CLEMENT: -- in the program -- sure. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Now, suppose I'm an 

employer, and I see somebody I really like, and I want 

to hire that person. And I say I'm going to give you 

$10 million a year to come work for me. And the person 

says, well, I -- you know, I've never been offered 

anywhere approaching $10 million a year. Of course, I'm 

going to say yes to that. 

Now, we would both be agreed that that's not 

coercive, right? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, I guess I'd want to know 

where the money came from --

(Laughter.) 

MR. CLEMENT: -- and if the money came 

from --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Wow. Wow. 

I'm offering you $10 million a year to come 

work for me, and you're saying that this is anything but

a great choice? 

MR. CLEMENT: Sure. If I told you, 

actually, it came from my own bank account. And that's 

what's really going on here, in part --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Ah. But, Mr. Clement --

MR. CLEMENT: -- and that's why it's not 

simply a matter of saying --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, can that 

possibly be? When a taxpayer pays taxes to the Federal 

Government, the person is acting as a citizen of the 

United States. When a taxpayer pays taxes to New York, 

a person is acting as a citizen of New York. And New 

York could no more tell the Federal Government what to 

do with the Federal Government's money than the Federal 

Government can tell New York what to do with the monies 

that New York is collecting. 

MR. CLEMENT: Right. And if New York and 

the United States figured out a way to tax individuals 

at greater than 100 percent of their income, then maybe 

you could just say it's two separate sovereigns, two 

separate taxes. But, we all know that in the real 

world, that to the extent the Federal Government 

continues to increase taxes, that decreases the ability 

of the States to tax their own citizenry, and it's a 

real tradeoff.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that a limit on the 

Federal Government's power to tax? 

MR. CLEMENT: What's that? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you suggesting that 

at a certain point, the States would have a claim 

against the Federal Government raising their taxes 

because somehow, the States will feel coerced to lower 

their tax rate? 

MR. CLEMENT: No, Justice Sotomayor, I'm 

not. What I'm suggesting is that it's not simply the 

case that you can say, well, it's free money, so we 

don't even have to ask whether the program's coercive. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, counsel, what 

percentage does it become coercive? Meaning, as I look 

at the figures I've seen from amici, there are some 

States for whom the percentage of Medicaid funding to 

their budget is close to 40 percent, but there are 

others that are less than 10 percent. 

And you say, across the board this is 

coercive because no State, even at 10 percent, can give 

it up. What -- what's the percentage of big gift that 

the Federal Government can give? And -- because what 

you're saying to me is, for a bankrupt State, there's no 

gift the Federal Government could give them ever, 

because it can only give them money without

1 conditions --

2  MR. CLEMENT: No, Justice Sotomayor --

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- no matter how poorly 

4 the State is run, no matter how much the Federal 

Government doesn't want to subsidize abortions or 

6 doesn't want to subsidize some other State obligation, 

7 the Federal Government can't give them 100 percent of 

8 their needs. 

9  MR. CLEMENT: And -- and Justice Sotomayor, 

I'm really saying the opposite, which is not that every 

11 gift is coercive, no matter what the amount, no matter 

12 how small. I'm saying essentially the opposite, which 

13 is there has to be some limit. There has to be some 

14 limit on coercion. 

And the reason is quite simple, because this 

16 Court's entire spending power jurisprudence is premised 

17 on the notion that spending power is different, and that 

18 Congress can do things pursuant to the spending power 

19 that it can't do pursuant to its other enumerated powers 

precisely because the programs are voluntary. And if 

21 you relax that assumption that the programs are 

22 voluntary, and you're saying they're coercion, then you 

23 can't have the spending power jurisprudence thatâ€™s different. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, what makes them 

coercive; that the State doesn't want to face its voters

and say, instead of taking 10, 20, 30, 40 percent of the 

government's offer of our budget and paying for it 

ourselves and giving up money for some other function? 

That's what makes it coercive --

MR. CLEMENT: Well, it's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that the State is 

unwilling to say that? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, maybe -- maybe I can 

talk about what makes it coercive by talking about the 

actual statute at issue here and focusing on what I 

think are the three hallmarks of this statute that make 

it uniquely coercive. 

One of them is the fact that this statute is 

tied to the decidedly nonvoluntary individual mandate. 

And that makes this unique, but it makes it significant, 

I think. 

I'll continue. I thought you had a 

question. I'm sorry. 

The second factor, of course, is the fact 

that Congress here made a distinct and conscious 

decision to tie the State's willingness to accept these 

new funds, not just to the new funds, but to their 

entire participation in the statute, even though the 

coverage for these newly eligible individuals is 

segregated from the rest of the program. And this is

section 2001(a)(3). It's at page 23A of the appendix to 

the blue brief. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that true of every 

Medicaid increase, that each time -- I mean, and this 

started quite many years ago, and Congress has added 

more people and given more benefits -- and every time, 

the condition is, if you want the Medicaid program, this 

is the program. Take it or leave it. 

MR. CLEMENT: No, Justice Ginsburg, this is 

distinct in two different directions. One is, in some 

of the prior expansions of the program, but not all, 

Congress has made covering newly eligible individuals 

totally voluntary. If the States want to cover the 

newly eligible individuals, they'll get additional 

money; but if they don't, they don't risk any of their 

existing participation programs. 

The 1972 program was a paradigm of that. It 

created this 209(b) option for States to participate. 

This Court talked about it in the Gray Panthers case. 

There were other expansions that have taken 

place, such as the 1984 expansions, where they didn't 

give States that option. But here's the second 

dimension in which this is distinct, which is here, 

Congress has created a separate part of the program for 

the newly eligible mandatory individuals. That's what

they called them. 

And those individuals are treated separately 

from the rest of the program going forward forever. 

They are going to be reimbursed at a different rate from 

everybody who was covered under the preexisting program. 

Now, in light of that separation by Congress 

itself of the newly eligible individuals from the rest 

of the program, it's very hard to understand Congress's 

decision to say, look, if you don't want to cover these 

newly eligible individuals, you don't just not get the 

new money, you don't get any of the money under the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that? 

I'm sorry. Where does it say that? 

MR. CLEMENT: It says it at -- well, it --

where does it say what, Justice Breyer? 

JUSTICE BREYER: What you just said. You 

said Congress said, if you don't take the new money to 

cover the new individuals, you don't get any of the old 

money that covers the old individuals. 

That's what I heard you say. 

MR. CLEMENT: Right. And then --

JUSTICE BREYER: And where does it say that? 

MR. CLEMENT: It says it -- there's two 

places where it says it.

So are we talking about the same thing?

MR. CLEMENT: -- among other things --

JUSTICE BREYER: And here's what it says at

MR. CLEMENT: -- the authority to cut off 

participation in the program, yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: It says, "The Secretary 

shall notify the State agency" -- this is if they don't 

comply -- "that further payments will not be made to the 

State, or in his discretion, that payments will be 

limited to categories under or parts of the State plan 

not affected by such failure, which it repeats until the 

Secretary is satisfied that he shall limit payments to 

categories under or parts of the State plan not affected 

by such failure."

to say it's up to the Secretary whether, should a State 

refuse to fund the new people, the Secretary will cut 

off funding for the new people, as it's obvious the 

State doesn't want it, and whether the Secretary can go 

further. I also should think -- I could not find one 

case where the Secretary ever did go further, but I also 

would think that the Secretary could not go further 

where going further would be an unreasonable thing to 

do -- since government action is governed by the 

Administrative Procedure Act, since it's governed by the 

general principle, it must always be reasonable. 

So I want to know where this idea came from 

that should State X say I don't want the new money, that 

the Secretary would or could cut off the old money? 

MR. CLEMENT: And Justice Breyer, here's 

where it comes from, which is from the very beginning of 

this litigation, we've pointed out that what's coercive 

is not the absolute guarantee that the Secretary could 

cut off every penny, but the fact that she could. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, let me 

relieve you of that concern, and tell me how I --

whether I have -- that a basic principle of 

administrative law -- indeed, all law -- is that the 

government must act reasonably. And should a Secretary 

cut off more money than the Secretary could show was

justified by being causally related to the State's 

refusal to take the new money, you would march into 

court with your clients and say, Judge, the Secretary 

here is acting unreasonably. And I believe there is 

implicit in this statute, as there is explicit in the 

ADA, that any such cutoff decision must be reasonable. 

Now, does that relieve you of your fear? 

MR. CLEMENT: It doesn't for this reason, 

Justice --

JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't think it would, 

but I --

(Laughter.) 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, but here's the reason. 

Here's the reason -- Justice Breyer, it doesn't. 

One is -- I mean, I don't know the opinion 

to cite for that proposition. 

Second is, I've been -- we've been making in 

this litigation since the very beginning this basic 

point, the government has had opportunities at every 

level of this system, and I suppose they'll have an 

opportunity today to say: Fear not, States. If you 

don't want to take the new conditions, all you will lose 

is the new money. And when we --

the Act, that there is some money that would be saved in 

the program if the States take the new money, and if 

they don't take the new money, there is money that is 

being spent that wouldn't otherwise be spent. There 

could be some pile like that. 

It might be that the Secretary could show it 

was reasonable to take that money away from the States, 

too --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Clement --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- but my point is, you 

have to show reasonableness before you can act. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- do -- do you agree -- do 

you agree that the government has to act reasonably? 

MR. CLEMENT: You know --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- do we strike down 

unreasonable statutes? My God! 

MR. CLEMENT: Well -- and, Justice Scalia, I 

mean --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The Executive has to act 

reasonably, that's certain, in implementing a statute; 

but if the statute says, in so many words, that the 

Secretary can strike the whole -- funding for the whole 

program, that's the law, unreasonable or not, isn't it? 

MR. CLEMENT: That's the way I would read 

the law, Your Honor.

MR. CLEMENT: And if I could just add one 

thing just to the discussion, is the point that, you 

know, this is not all hypothetical. I mean, in -- there 

was a record in the district court, and there is an 

Exhibit 33 to our motion for summary judgment. It's 

not -- it's not in the joint appendix. We can lodge it 

with the Court if they'd -- if you'd like. 

But it's a letter that's in the record in 

this litigation, and it's a letter from the Secretary to 

Arizona, when Arizona floated the idea that it would 

like to withdraw from the CHIP program, which is a 

relatively small part of the whole program. 

And what Arizona was told by the Secretary 

is that if you withdraw from the CHIP program, you risk 

losing $7.8 billion, the entirety of your Medicaid 

participation. So, this is not something that we've 

conjured up --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, let's let 

this --

better, I want to pursue this for 1 more minute.

Justice Scalia knows as well, which use -- Holly Hill, 

uses the same word as this statute: "In the Secretary's 

discretion." And in those cases, this Court has said 

that doesn't mean the Secretary can do anything that he 

or she wants, but rather, they are limited to what is 

not arbitrary, capricious, and abuse of discretion, in 

interpreting statutes, in applying those statutes, et 

cetera. 

End of my argument. End of my question. 

Respond as you wish. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, I'm not 

sure that the Court's federalism jurisprudence should 

force States to depend on how a lower court reads Holly 

Hill. I think that really, right here, what we know to 

an absolute certainty is that this Secretary -- this 

statute gives the Secretary the right to remove all of 

the State's funding under these programs. 

And think about what that is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: May I ask you a 

question, Mr. Clement? Do you think that the Federal 

Government couldn't, if it chose -- Congress -- say: 

The system doesn't work. We're just simply going to 

rehaul it. It's not consistent with how -- what we want 

to accomplish. We're just going to do away with the

system and start a new health care plan of some sort. 

And, States, you can take the new plan, you can leave 

them. We're going to give out 20 percent less, maybe 

20 percent more, depending on what Congress chooses. 

Can Congress do that? Does it have to 

continue the old system because that is what the States 

are relying upon, and it's coercive now to give them a 

new system? 

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Sotomayor, we're not 

saying we have a vested right to participate in the 

Medicaid program as it exists now. So, if Congress 

wanted to scrap the current system and have a new one, 

I'm not going to tell you that there's no possibility of 

a coercion challenge to it, but I'm -- I'm not going to 

say. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I -- I want 

to know how I draw the line, meaning --

MR. CLEMENT: -- this ought -- well, can 

we --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I think the usual 

definition of coercion is, I don't have a choice. I'm 

not sure what -- why it's not a choice for the States. 

They may not pay for something else. If they don't take 

Medicaid, and they want to keep the same level of 

coverage, they may have to make cuts in their budget to

other services they provide. That's a political choice 

of whether they choose to do that or not. 

But when have we defined the right or 

limited the right of government not to spend money in 

the ways that it thinks appropriate? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Sotomayor, 

before -- I mean, I'll try to answer that question, too. 

But the first part of the question was, you know, what 

if the Congress just tried to scrap this and start over 

again with a new program? 

Here's why this is fundamentally different 

and why it's fundamentally more coercive, because 

Congress is not saying we want to scrap this program. 

They don't have a single complaint, really, with the way 

that States are providing services to the visually 

impaired and the disabled under pre-existing Medicaid. 

And that's why it's particularly questionable why 

they're saying that if you don't take our new money, 

subject to the new conditions, we're going to take all 

of the money you've previously gotten that you've been 

dependent on for 45 years, and you're using right now to 

serve the visually impaired and the disabled --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Clement, may I -- may 

I ask you -- question another line? 

You represent, what, 26 States?

MR. CLEMENT: That's right, 

Justice Ginsburg. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And we're also told that 

there are other States that like this expansion, and 

they are very glad to have it. 

The relief that you're seeking is to say the 

whole expansion is no good, never mind that there are 

States that say we don't feel coerced, we think this is 

good. 

You are -- you're saying that because you 

represent a sizeable number of States, you can destroy 

this whole program, even though there may be as many 

States that want it, that don't feel coerced, that 

say -- think this is a good thing? 

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, that's 

right, but that shouldn't be a terrible concern, because 

if Congress wants to do what it did in 1972 and pass a 

statute that makes the expansion voluntary, every State 

that thinks that this is a great deal can sign up. 

What's telling here, though, is 26 States 

who think that this is a bad deal for them actually are 

also saying that they have no choice but to take this 

because they can't afford to have their entire 

participation in this 45-year-old program wiped out, and 

they have to go back to square one and figure out how

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Clement, I didn't take 

the time to figure this out, but maybe you did. Is 

there any chance that all 26 States opposing it have 

Republican governors, and all of the States supporting 

it have Democratic governors? 

Is that possible? 

MR. CLEMENT: There's a correlation, 

Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Yes. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let -- let me ask you 

another thing, Mr. -- Mr. Clement. Most colleges and 

universities are heavily dependent on the government to 

fund their research programs and other things, and 

that's been going on for a long time. And then Title IX 

passes, and a government official comes around and 

say -- says to these colleges, if you want money for 

your physics labs and all the other things you get it 

for, then you have to create an athletic program for 

girls. And the recipient says I am being coerced, 

there's no way in the world I can give up all the funds 

to run all these labs that we have. I can't give it up, 

so I'm being coerced to accept this program that I don't

want. 

Why doesn't your theory -- if your theory is 

any good, why doesn't it work anytime something --

someone receives something that's too good to give up? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, 

there's two reasons that might be different. One is, 

this whole line of coercion only applies -- is only 

relevant, really, when Congress tries to do something 

through the spending power it couldn't do directly. 

So if Congress tried to impose Title IX 

directly, I guess the question for this Court would be 

whether or not Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment 

allowed Congress to do that. I imagine you might think 

that it did, and I imagine some of your colleagues might 

take issue with that, but that's -- that's the nature of 

the question. 

So, one way around that would be, if 

Congress can do it directly, you don't even have to ask 

whether there's something special about the spending 

power. That's how this Court resolved, for example, the 

FAIR case about funding to -- to colleges. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where on your -- I'm 

trying to understand your coercion theory. I know that 

there are cases of ours that have said there's a line 

between pressure and coercion, but we have never had, in

the history of this country or the Court, any Federal 

program struck down because it was so good that it 

becomes coercive to be in it. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, if --

I'm going -- to say the second thing about my answer to 

your prior question, which is just that I also think 

that, you know, it may be that spending on certain 

private universities is something, again, that Congress 

can do, and it doesn't matter whether it's coercion. 

But when they're trying to get the States to expand 

their Medicaid programs, that's something --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's take -- let's take 

public colleges. 

MR. CLEMENT: Okay. Then there -- then 

there may be some limits on that. I mean -- but again, 

I'm not sure, even in that context, there might not be 

some things Congress can do. It's a separate question. 

But once we take the premise, which I don't 

think there's a disagreement here, that Congress could 

not simply, as a matter of direct legislation under the 

commerce power or something, say, States, you must 

expand your Medicaid programs. If we take that as a 

given, then I think we have to ask the question of 

whether or not it's coercive. 

Now, you -- in -- in your second question,

you asked, well, you know, I mean, where's the case that 

says that we've crossed that line? And this is that 

case, I would respectfully say --

JUSTICE BREYER: And isn't the covenant 

going to apply, as well, to the 1980 extension to 

children 0 to 6 years old, 1990 requiring the extension 

for children up to 18? All those prior extensions, to 

me, seem just as big in amount, just about as big in the 

number of people coming on the rolls, and they all are 

governed by precisely the same statute that you're 

complaining of here, which has been in the law since 

'65. 

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, I don't think 

that our position here would necessarily extend to say 

the 1984 amendments, and let me tell you why. You know, 

I'm -- I'm not saying that absolutely that's guaranteed 

that's not coercive, but here's reasons why they're 

different. 

The one major difference is the size of the 

program. I mean, the expansion of Medicaid since 1984 

is really breathtaking. Medicaid, circa 1984, the 

Federal spending to the States was a shade over 

$21 billion. Right now, it's $250 billion, and that's 

before the expansion under this statute.

Mr. Clement, doesn't that mean that Medicaid is 

unconstitutional now? 

MR. CLEMENT: Not necessarily, 

Justice Kagan. And, again, it's because we're not here 

with a one trick pony. And this -- one of the 

factors -- we point you to three factors that make this 

statute uniquely coercive. One of them is the sheer 

size of this program. 

And, you know, if you want a -- if you want 

a gauge on the size of this program, the best place to 

look is the government's own number. Footnote 6, page 10 

of their brief. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: So, when does a program 

become too big? I'd want you to -- give me a dollar 

number. 

MR. CLEMENT: $3.3 trillion over the next 10 

years. That's -- that is --

JUSTICE KAGAN: I thought $1 trillion --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'll tell you this number, 

which I did look up, that the amount, approximately, if 

you look into it -- as a percentage of GDP, it's big, 

but it was before this somewhere about 2-point-something 

percent, fairly low, of GDP. It'll go up to something a 

little bit over 3 percent of GDP. And now go look at 

the comparable numbers, which I did look at, with the

expansion that we're talking about before. 

The expansion from 0 to 18 or even from 0 to 

6. And while you can argue those numbers, it's pretty 

hard to argue that they aren't roughly comparable as a 

percentage of the prior program or as a percentage of 

GDP. 

If I'm right on those numbers or even 

roughly right -- I don't guarantee them -- then would 

you have to say, well, indeed, Medicaid has been 

unconstitutional since 1964. 

And if not, why not? 

MR. CLEMENT: The answer is no, and that's 

because we're here saying there are three things that 

make this statute unique. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What are your second and 

third? I'm on pins and needles to hear your second --

(Laughter.) 

MR. CLEMENT: Yes, exactly. 

Well, one is the sheer size. Two is the 

fact that this statute uniquely is tied to an individual 

mandate which is decidedly nonvoluntary. And three is 

the fact that they've leveraged the prior participation 

in the program, notwithstanding that they've broken this 

out as a separately segregated fund going forward, which 

is not to prove --

JUSTICE KAGAN: So, on the third -- on the 

third, suppose you have the current program and Congress 

wakes up tomorrow and says we think that there's too 

much fraud and abuse in the program, and we're going to 

put some new conditions on how the States use this money 

so we can prevent fraud and abuse, and we're going to 

tie it to everything that's been there initially. 

Unconstitutional? 

MR. CLEMENT: No, I think that is 

constitutional because I think that's something that 

Congress could do directly. It wouldn't have to limit 

that to the spending program. And I think 18 U.S.C. 666 

is -- is a statute -- you know, it may -- it's in the 

criminal code. It may be tied to spending, but I think 

that's -- that's a provision that I don't think its 

constitutionality's called into question. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: I guess I don't get the 

idea. I mean, Congress can legislate fraud and abuse 

restrictions in Medicaid, and Congress can legislate 

coverage expansions in Medicaid. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kagan, I think 

there's a difference, but if I'm wrong about that and 

the consequence is that Congress has to break Medicaid 

down into remotely manageable pieces as opposed to 

$3.3 trillion over 10 years before the expansion, I

don't think that would be the end of the world. But I 

really would ask you to focus on specifically what's 

going on here, which is they take these newly eligible 

people -- and that's a massive change in the way the 

program works. 

These are people who are healthy, childless 

adults who are not covered in many States. They say, 

okay, we're going to make you cover those. We're going 

to have a separate program for how you get reimbursed 

for that. You get reimbursed differently from all the 

previously eligible individuals. But if you don't take 

our money, we're going to take away your participation 

in the program for the visually impaired and the 

disabled. 

If I may reserve the balance of my time. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm -- I'm not 

sure my colleagues have exhausted their questions. 

So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I guess my greatest 

fear, Mr. Clement, with your argument is the following: 

The bigger the problem, the more resources it needs. 

We're going to tie the hands of the Federal Government 

in choosing how to structure a cooperative relationship 

with the States. We're going to say to the Federal 

Government, the bigger the problem, the less your powers

are, because once you give that much money, you can't 

structure the program the way you want. It's our money, 

Federal Government. We're going to have to run the 

program ourself to protect all our interests. 

I don't see where to draw that line. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, if you --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The uninsured are a 

problem for States only because they, too, politically, 

just like the Federal Government, can't let the poor 

die. And so, to the extent they don't want to do that, 

it's because they feel accountable to their citizenry. 

And so, if they want to do it their way, they have to 

spend the money to do it their way, if they don't want 

to do it the Federal way. 

So, I -- I just don't understand the logic 

of saying, States, you can't -- you don't -- you're not 

entitled to our money, but once you start taking it, the 

more you take, the more power you have. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Sotomayor, a 

couple of points. One is, I actually think that sort of 

misdescribes what happened with Medicaid. I mean, 

States were, as you suggest, providing for the poor and 

the visually impaired and the disabled even before 

Medicaid came along. Then all of a sudden, States --

the Federal Government said, look, we'd like to help you

with that, and we're going to give you money 

voluntarily. And then over time, they give more money 

with more conditions. And now they decide they're going 

to totally expand the program, and they say that you 

have to give up even your prior program, where we --

first came in and offered you cooperation, we're now 

going to say you have to give that up if you don't take 

our new conditions. 

Secondarily, I do think that our principle 

is not that when you get past a certain level, it 

automatically becomes coercive per se. But I do think 

when you get a program and you're basically telling 

States that, look, we're going to take away 

$3.3 trillion over the next 10 years, that at that 

point, it's okay to insist that Congress be a little 

more careful that it not be so aggressively coercive as 

it was in this statute. 

And I would simply say that -- we're not 

here to tell you that this is going to be an area where 

it's going to be very easy to draw the line. We're just 

telling you that it's exceptionally important to draw 

that line, and this is a case where it ought to be easy 

to establish a beachhead, say that coercion matters, say 

there's three factors of this particular statute that 

make it as obviously coercive as any piece of

said I can ask this. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He doesn't always 

check first. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA: As -- as I recall your --

your theory, it is that to determine whether something 

is coercive, you look to only one side, how much you're 

threatened with losing or offered to receive. And the 

other side doesn't matter. 

I don't think that's realistic. I mean, I 

think, you know, the -- the old Jack Benny thing, your 

money or your life, and, you know, he says, "I'm 

thinking, I'm thinking." It's -- it's funny, because 

it's no choice. You know? Your life? Again, it's just 

money. It's an easy choice. No coercion, right? I 

mean -- right? 

Now, whereas, if -- if the choice were your 

life or your wife's, that's a lot harder. 

Now, is it -- is it coercive in both

money, of course you can't turn it down, or is it the 

amount that's going to be taken away if you don't take 

what they're offering?

one is the sheer amount of money here makes it very, 

very difficult to refuse, because it's not money that, 

you know, that's come from some -- you know, China or 

from -- you know, the â€“ the â€“ the export tariffs like in 

the old day. It's coming from the taxpayers. So, 

that's part of it. 

The fact that they're being asked to give up 

their continuing participation in a program that they've 

been participating in for 45 years as a condition to 

accept the new program, we think that's the second thing 

that's critical --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why isn't that 

a consequence of how willing they have been since the 

New Deal to take the Federal Government's money? And it 

seems to me that they have compromised their status as 

independent sovereigns because they are so dependent on 

what the Federal Government has done, they should not be 

surprised that the Federal Government, having attached 

the -- they tied the strings, they shouldn't be 

surprised if the Federal Government isn't going to start 

pulling them. 

MR. CLEMENT: With all due respect, 

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think we can say that, you 

know, the States have gotten pretty dependent, so let's 

call this whole federalism thing off. And I just think

it's too important, because, again, the consequence --

if you think about it -- if -- the consequence of saying 

that we're not going to police the coercion line here 

shouldn't be that well, you know, it's just too hard, so 

we'll give the Federal Congress unlimited spending 

power. 

The consequence ought to be, if you really 

can't police this line, then you should go back and 

reconsider your cases that say that Congress can spend 

money on things that it can't do directly. 

Now, we're not asking you to go that far. 

We're simply saying that, look, your spending power 

cases absolutely depend on there being a line between 

coercion --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But could you tell me --

MR. CLEMENT: -- and voluntary action. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't understand your 

first answer to Justice Kagan. You don't see there 

being a difference between the Federal Government saying 

we want to take care of the poor; States, if you do 

this, we'll pay 100 percent of your administrative 

costs. 

And you said that could be coercion. All 

right? Doesn't the amount of burden that the State 

undertakes to meet the Federal obligation count in this

equation at all? 

MR. CLEMENT: It -- it certainly can, 

Justice Sotomayor. I didn't mean to suggest, in 

answering Justice Kagan's question, that my case was no 

better than that hypothetical. I mean, but it's in the 

nature of things that I do think the amount of the 

money, even considered alone, does make a difference, 

and it's precisely because it has an effect on their 

ability to raise revenue from their own citizens. So, 

it's not just free money that they are turning down if 

they want to; it really is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, if we go back 

to that era of matching what a State pays to what a 

State gets, Florida loses. Its citizens pay out much 

less than what they get back in Federal subsidies of all 

kinds. So, you can't really be making the argument that 

Florida can't ask for more than it gives, because it's 

really giving less than it receives. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, then I'll make --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't really want to 

go back to that point, do you? 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, then I'll make that 

argument on behalf of Texas.

my argument depends on, and that's the critical thing. 

It's one aspect of what makes this statute uniquely 

coercive. 

And I really think if you ask the question, 

what explains the idea that if you don't take this new 

money, you're going to lose all your money under what 

you have been doing for 45 years to help out the 

visually impaired and the disabled? Nobody in Congress 

wants the States to stop doing that. They're just doing 

it, and it's purely coercive, to condition the money. 

It's leverage, pure and simple. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the inevitable 

consequence of your position was that the Federal 

Government could just do this on its own, the Federal 

Government could have Medicaid, Medicare, and these 

insurance regulations -- assuming that's true -- then 

how are the interests of federalism concerned? How are 

the interests of federalism concerned if, in Florida or 

Texas or some of the other objecting States, there are 

huge Federal bureaucracies doing what this bill allows 

the State bureaucracies to do? 

I know you've thought about that. I'd just 

like your answer. 

MR. CLEMENT: I have, and I would like to 

elaborate, but the one-word answer is "accountability."

If the Federal Government decides to spend 

money through Federal instrumentalities, and the citizen 

is hacked off about it, they can bring a Federal 

complaint to a Federal official working in a Federal 

agency. 

And what makes this so pernicious is that 

the Federal Government knows that the citizenry is not 

going to take lightly the idea that there are huge, new 

Federal bureaucracies popping up across the country. 

And so, they get the benefit of administering this 

program through State officials, but then it makes it 

very confusing for the citizen who doesn't like this. 

Do they complain to the State official because it's 

being administered by a State official in a State 

building? Or do they --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Clement --

MR. CLEMENT: -- or do they --

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- that is very confusing, 

because the idea behind cooperative Federal/State 

programs was exactly a federalism idea. It was to give 

the States the ability to administer those programs. It 

was to give the States a great deal of flexibility in 

running those programs. And that's exactly what 

Medicaid is. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, that's exactly what

Medicaid was. The question is, what will it be going 

forward? 

And I absolutely take your point, 

Justice Kagan. Cooperative federalism is a beautiful 

thing. Mandatory federalism has very little to 

recommend it, because it poses exactly --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Cooperative federalism --

MR. CLEMENT: -- the kind of 

accountability --

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- does not mean that there 

are no Federal mandates and no Federal restrictions 

involved in a program that uses 90 percent here, 

100 percent Federal money. It means there's flexibility 

built into the program subject to certain rules that the 

Federal Government has about how it wishes its money to 

be used. 

It's like giving a gift certificate. If I 

give you a gift certificate for one store, you can't use 

it for other stores. But still, you can use it for all 

kinds of different things. 

MR. CLEMENT: But -- I absolutely agree that 

if it's cooperative federalism and the States have 

choices, then that is perfectly okay. But when --

that's why voluntariness in coercion is so important. 

Because if you force a State to participate in a Federal

program, then -- I mean, as long as it's voluntary, then 

a State official shouldn't complain if a citizen 

complains to the State about the way the State's 

administering a Federal program that it volunteered to 

participate in. But at the point it becomes coercive, 

then it's not fair to tell the citizen to complain to 

the State official, they had no choice. 

But who do they complain to at the Federal 

level? There's nobody there, which would be -- I'm not 

saying it's the best solution to have Federal 

instrumentalities in every State, but it actually is 

better than what you get when you have mandatory 

federalism, and you lose the accountability that is 

central to the federalism provisions in the 

Constitution.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

they cannot now afford. It is an exercise of the 

Spending Clause power that complies with all of the 

limits set forth in this Court's decision in Dole, and 

the States do not contend otherwise. The States are 

asking this Court to do something unprecedented, which 

is to declare this an impermissibly coercive exercise 

of power.

Steward Machine and in Dole is that it's possible that 

you might envision a situation in which there's 

coercion.

much more, but I can think of something.

here. And I -- I would like to, if I could, take up 

each of the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I know 

it's -- I know it's different here. I'm just trying to 

understand if you accept the fact or regard it as true 

that there is a coercion limit, or that once the Federal 

Government -- once you're taking Federal Government 

money, the Federal Government money -- can take it back, 

and that doesn't affect the voluntariness of your 

choice? 

Because it does seem like a serious problem. 

We're assuming, under the Spending Clause the Federal 

Government cannot do this. Under the Constitution it 

cannot do this. But if it gets the State to agree to 

it, well then it can. 

And the concern is, if you can say, if you 

don't agree to this you lose all your money, whether 

that's really saying the -- the limitation in the 

Constitution is -- is largely meaningless.

context --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give --

GENERAL VERRILLI: -- in which it arises. 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- you a factual context. 

Let's say Congress says this to the States: We -- we've 

got great news for you. We know that your expenditures 

on education are a huge financial burden, so we're going 

to take that completely off your shoulders. We are 

going to impose a special Federal education tax which 

will raise exactly the same amount of money as all of 

the States now spend on education, and then we are going 

to give you a grant that is equal to what you spent on 

education last year. 

Now, this is a great offer and we think you 

will take it, but of course, if you take it, it's going 

to have some conditions because we're going to set rules 

on teacher tenure, on collective bargaining, on 

curriculum, on textbooks, class size, school calendar, 

and many other things. So, take it or leave it.

If you take it, you have to follow our rules

you're going to have to fine -- you are going to have to 

tax your citizens, they're going to have to pay the 

Federal education tax. But on top of that, you're going 

to have to tax them for all of the money that you're now 

spending on education, plus all of the Federal funds 

that you were previously given. 

Would that be -- would that reach the 

point -- would that be the point where financial 

inducement turns into coercion? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: No, I don't think so --

JUSTICE ALITO: No? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: -- because they do -- the 

States do have a choice there, especially as a -- as a 

going-in proposition. I mean, the argument the States 

are making here is not that they're -- that -- this is 

not a going-in proposition. Their -- their argument is 

that they're -- they are in a position where they don't 

have a choice because of everything that's happened 

before. But --

that's the case, then there's nothing left --

GENERAL VERRILLI: -- as a practical 

matter -- I disagree with that, Justice Alito. First of 

all, as a practical matter, there's a pretty serious 

political constraint on that situation ever arising, 

because it's not like the Federal Government is going to 

have an easy time of raising the kinds of tax revenues 

that need to be -- needed to raised to work that kind of 

fundamental transformation, and that's real. And -- and 

political constraints do operate to protect federalism 

in this area, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought there 

was a serious political strain -- constraint on the 

individual mandate, too, but that didn't work. 

What you call serious political constraints 

sometimes don't work. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: But -- but with respect 

to a situation like that one, Justice Scalia, the -- the 

States have their education system, and they can decide 

whether they're going to go in or not. But here, of 

course, I think it's important to trace through the 

history of Medicaid. It is not the case, as my friend 

from the other side suggested, that the norm here is 

that the Federal Government has offered to the States 

the opportunity either to stay where they are or add the 

new piece.

We can debate that proposition with respect 

to 1972 one way or another. The States have one view 

about that; we have a different one. But starting in 

the 1984 expansion, with respect to pregnant women and 

infants, it was an expansion of the entire program; 

States were given the choice to stay in the entire 

program or not. 1989, when the program was expanded to 

children under 6 years of age, under 133 percent of 

poverty, same thing. 1990, kids 6 to 18 and 100 percent 

of poverty, same thing. In fact, every major expansion, 

same thing. 

And so, I just think the history of the 

program, and particularly when you read that in context 

of 42 U.S.C. 1304, which reserves the right of the 

Federal Government to amend the program going forward, 

shows you that this is something that the States have 

understood all along. This has been the evolution of 

it, and with respect to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you give me 

some assurance? We heard the question about whether or 

not the Secretary would use this authority to the extent 

available. Are there circumstances where you are willing 

to say that that would not be permissible? I'm thinking 

of the Arizona letter, for example. I mean, if I had 

the authority and I was in that position, I would use it

all the time. You might -- you want some little change 

made? Well, guess what, I can take away all your money 

if you don't make it. I win. 

Every time, it seems that that would be the 

case. 

So, why shouldn't we be concerned about the 

extent of authority that the government is exercising 

simply because they could do something less? We have to 

analyze the case on the assumption that that power will 

be exercised, don't we? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, 

it would not be responsible of me to stand here in 

advance of any particular situation becoming -- coming 

before the Secretary of Health and Human Services and 

commit to how that would be resolved one way or another. 

But that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I appreciate 

that. I appreciate that, but I guess --

GENERAL VERRILLI: That discretion is there 

in the statute, and I think there's every reason to 

think it's real, but I do think, getting back to the 

circumstances here --

respect to the Medicaid expansion, the States' argument 

is, as they've said it in their briefs, they 

articulated a little bit different this morning -- this 

afternoon. But as they said it in their briefs was it's 

not what you stand to gain, but what you stand to lose. 

But I think an important thing in evaluating 

that argument in this context is fully 60 percent of 

Medicaid expenditures in this country are based on 

optional choices. And I don't mean by that the optional 

choices of the States to stay in the program in '84 or 

'88 or '89. But -- but States are given choices to

expand the beneficiaries beyond the Federal minimum and 

to expand services beyond the Federal minimum. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And just a small point, 

and please correct me if I'm wrong. It -- does this Act 

not require States to keep at the present level their 

existing Medicaid expenditure? So, some States may have 

been more generous than others in Medicaid, but this Act 

freezes that so the States can't go back. Or am I 

incorrect? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: It's much more nuanced 

than that, Justice Kennedy. There is something called a 

maintenance of effort provision which lasts until 2014, 

until such time as the Medicaid expansion takes place 

and the exchanges are in place. That applies to the 

population. It says, with respect to the population, 

you can't take anybody out. It does not apply to the 

optional benefits where the States still have 

flexibility. They can still reduce optional benefits 

that they're now providing if they -- if they want to, 

to control costs. They can also work on provider rates. 

There's also -- with respect to demonstration projects 

by which some States have expanded their populations 

beyond the required eligibility levels, they don't have 

to keep them in. And then there's also, if the State 

has a budgetary crisis, it can get a waiver of that, as

Wisconsin did. So, that is a -- that's a provision I 

think that does a significant degree less than my 

friends on the other side have suggested in terms of --

in terms of its effect, and its effect beyond that is 

just temporary. 

But I do think with respect to the -- the 

first of their three arguments for coercion, the sheer 

size argument, that it's very difficult to see how that 

is going to work, because if the question is about what 

you stand to lose rather than what you stand to gain, 

then it seems to me that it doesn't matter whether the 

Medicaid expansion is substantial or whether it's 

modest, or whether there's any expansion at all. The 

States, for example -- the Federal Government, for 

example, could decide that under the -- under the 

current system, too much money has ended up flowing to 

nursing home care and that money would be better serving 

the general welfare if it were directed at infants and 

children. 

But if the Federal Government said we're 

going to redirect the spending priorities of the Federal 

money that we're offering to you, the States could say, 

well, geez, we don't like that; we'd like to keep 

spending the money the way we were, and we have no 

choice, because this has gotten too big for us to exit.

And so -- and in fact, it seems to me, standing here 

today before these expansions take place, under their 

theory, the provision is coercive. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The smaller it, is the 

bigger the coercion. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The smaller what you're 

demanding of them, the bigger the coercion to go along. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: The more they stand to 

lose. And so -- and then I think it -- I'm sorry, 

Justice Breyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Just before you leave that, 

I'd appreciate it if you would expand a little bit on 

the answer to Justice Kagan's question for the reason, 

when I read the cutoff statute, which as I said has been 

there since 1965 unchanged, it does refer to the 

Secretary's discretion to keep the funding, insofar as 

the funding has no relationship to the failure to comply 

with the condition. 

And as I read that, that gives the Secretary 

the authority to cut off all the money that the States' 

refusal to accept the condition means they shouldn't 

have. But nothing there says they can go beyond that 

and cut off unrelated money. Now, there is a sentence, 

says maybe they could do that. But I thought they had

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there -- I could find no 

instance where they went beyond the funds that were 

related to the thing that the State refused to do or 

things affected by that. I would like you to tell me, 

when you looked into it, that what I thought of in this 

isolation chamber here is actually true. Or whether 

they have gone around threatening people that we will 

cut off totally unrelated funds. 

What is the situation? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: I think the situation is 

generally as you've described it, but I do want to be 

careful in saying I don't think it would be responsible 

of me to commit now that the Secretary would exercise 

the discretion uniformly in one way or another. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's 

just saying that when, you know, the analogy that has 

been used, the gun to your head, "your money or your 

life," you say, well, there's no evidence that anyone

1 States to expand beyond what Federal law requires, is

JUSTICE ALITO: And General Verrilli, is this --

6 is this discussion realistic? The objective of the 

7 Affordable Care Act is to provide near universal health 

8 care. 

9  Now, suppose that all of the 26 States that 

are parties to this case were to say, well, we're not 

11 going to -- we're not going to abide by the new 

12 conditions. Then, there would be a huge portion -- a 

13 big portion of the population that would not have health 

14 care. 

And it's a realistic possibility that the 

16 Secretary is going to say, well, okay, fine, you know, 

17 we're going to cut off your new funds, but we're not 

18 going to cut off your old funds, and just let that

it's coercive by virtue of its relationship to the 

Affordable Care Act, I really think that that's a 

misconception, and I'd like to be able to take a minute 

and walk through and explain why that is. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: General Verrilli, before you 

do that, I'm sorry, but in response to the 

Chief Justice's question, I mean, "the money or your 

life" has consequence because we're worried that that 

person is actually going to shoot. So, I think that 

this question about are -- what do we think the 

Secretary is going to do is an important one. 

And as I understand it, I mean, when the 

Secretary withdraws funds, what the Secretary is doing 

is withdrawing funds from poor people's health care, and 

that the Secretary is reluctant and loath to take money 

away from poor people's health care and that that's why 

these things are always worked out. It's that the 

Secretary really doesn't want to use this power, and so 

the Secretary sits down with the State and figures out a 

way for the Secretary not to use the power. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: That's correct, 

Justice Kagan. That is no --

GENERAL VERRILLI: That's another way of 

trying to say what I was trying to say to Justice Scalia 

earlier, is that the States and the Federal Government 

share a common objective here, which is to get health 

care to the needy. And, in the vast majority of 

instances, they work together to make that happen. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but the 

question is not -- obviously, the States are interested 

in the same objective, and they have a disagreement, or 

they have budget realities that they have to deal with. 

And States say, well, we're going to cut by 10 percent 

what we reimburse this for or that for, and the Federal 

Government says, well, you can't. 

And no one is suggesting that people want to 

cut health care, but they have different views about how 

to implement policy in this area. 

And the concern is that the Secretary has 

the total and complete say because the Secretary has the 

authority under this provision to say you lose 

everything. No one has suggested in the normal course 

that will happen, but so long as the Federal Government 

has that power, it seems to be a significant intrusion 

on the sovereign interests of the State. 

Now, I'm not -- it may be something they 

gave up many decades ago when they decided to live off

Federal funds, but I don't think you can deny that it's 

a significant authority that we're giving the Federal 

Government to say you can take away everything if the 

States don't buy into the next program. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, but what I would 

say about that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that we recognize 

that these decisions aren't going to be easy decisions 

in some circumstances. As a practical matter, there may 

be circumstances in which they are very difficult 

decisions. But that's different from saying that 

they're coercive, and it's different from saying that is 

an -- that it's an unconstitutional --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why is it different? Why 

is it different? I mean, I thought it might be very 

unlikely a State would ever say that the government --

Federal Government would say here's a condition that you 

have to have a certain kind of eyeglasses for people who 

don't see. And, by the way, if you don't do that, we'll 

take away $42 billion of funding. Okay? 

I thought such a thing would not happen. 

And I thought if it tried to happen, that it's governed 

by the APA, and the person with the eyeglasses would say 

it's arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion. And 

that's so even though the statute says it's in the 

discretion of the Secretary.

that that -- and that's not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, part of the 

discretion is to cut off all of the funds. That's what 

the statute says, and I think --.

I'm not willing to give that away. But that doesn't 

make this --

bar that, but the APA surely has to apply to a 

discretionary act of the Secretary.

authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services 

and how it will apply in the future. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't worry a lot if I 

were you. I don't know of any case that, where the 

Secretary's discretion explicitly includes a certain 

act, we have held that, nevertheless, that act cannot be 

performed unless we think it reasonable. I don't know 

any case like that. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Holly Hill. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, when there's just a 

general grant of discretion, it has to be exercised 

reasonably. But maybe Justice Breyer knows such a case. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I do. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Give it to me. 

(Laughter.) 

GENERAL VERRILLI: If I could go back to the 

sheer size idea, there are, I think, another couple of 

points that are important in thinking about whether 

that's a principle courts could ever apply. 

Once you get into that business -- in 

addition to the problem I identified earlier, that it 

basically means that Congress has frozen in place now, 

based on the size of the program, you've got this 

additional issue of having to make a judgment about in

what circumstances will -- will the loss of the Federal 

funding be so significant that you would count it 

as being coercive. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose one test could 

be -- I just don't see that it would be very workable --

is whether or not it's so big that accountability is 

lost, that it is not clear to the citizen that the State

even though it's a State administrator.

it's what you stand to lose, and with respect to 

withdrawal -- I mean -- so, does it depend on -- is it 

an absolute or a relative number with respect to how 

much of the State budget? Is it a situation where you 

have to make a calculation about how hard would it be 

for that State to make up in State tax revenues the 

Federal revenue they would lose? Does that depend on 

whether it's a high tax State or a low tax State? It 

just seems to me -- and then, what is the political 

climate in that State? It seems to me like --

clear line of accountability for political acts? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, of course, it does, 

Justice Kennedy. But, here --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that subsumed in the 

coercion test, or is that an independent test? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: You know, here, the 

coercion test, as it's been discussed, I think, for 

example, in Justice O'Connor's dissent in Dole and in 

some of the other literature, does address federalism 

concerns in the sense of the Federal Government using 

Federal funding in one area to try to get States to act 

in an area where the Federal Government may not have 

Article I authority. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: But, as Your Honor 

suggested earlier, this is a situation in which, while 

it is certainly true that the Federal Government 

couldn't require the States, as the Chief Justice 

indicated, to carry out this program, the Federal 

Government could, as Your Honor suggested, expand 

Medicare and do it itself.

federalism, necessary for the idea of federalism, that 

there be a clear line of accountability so the citizen 

knows that it's the Federal or the State government who 

should be held responsible for their program?

think the problem here is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And does coercion relate 

to that, or is that a separate --

GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, but I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is that a separate 

doctrine? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think it relates 

to it in the opposite way that my friends on the other 

side would like it to, in that I think their argument is 

that it would subject us to such a high degree of 

political accountability at the State level to withdraw 

ourselves from the program, that it's an unpalatable 

choice for us, and that's where the coercive effect 

comes from. And that's why I think coercion --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I think the 

answer would be that the State wants to preserve its 

integrity, its identity, its responsibility in the 

Federal system.

JUSTICE SCALIA: May it do so? 

Doesn't the question come down to this --

maybe you can answer this "yes." But isn't the question 

simply: Is it conceivable to you, as it was evidently 

not to Congress, that any State would turn down this 

offer, that they can't refuse? Is it conceivable to you 

that any State would have said no to this program? 

Congress didn't think that, because some of its other 

provisions are based on the assumption that every single 

State will be in this thing. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, do you -- can you 

conceive of a State saying no? And -- and if you can't, 

that sounds like coercion to me. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: I think -- I think 

Congress predicted that States would stay in this 

program, but the -- prediction is not coercion. And the 

reason Congress predicted it, I think, Justice Scalia, 

is because the Federal Government is paying 90-plus 

percent of the costs. It increases State costs by 21 

percent. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, what do you predict? 

If you predict the same, that 100 percent of the States 

will accept it, that sounds like coercion.

coercion. I disagree, Justice Scalia. That's just an 

assumption, and if it proves to be wrong, then Congress 

has time to recalibrate. And beyond that, I do think --

I just want to go back to the -- the other part of Your 

Honor's point -- that with respect to the relationship 

between Medicaid and the -- and the Act and particularly 

the minimum coverage provision, my friend Mr. Clement 

has suggested that you can infer coercion because, with 

respect to the population to which the provision 

applies, if there's no Medicaid, there's no other way 

for them to satisfy the requirement. 

I want to work through that for a minute, if 

I may, because it's just incorrect. 

First of all, with respect to anybody at 

100 percent of the poverty line or above, there is an 

alternative in the statute. It's the exchanges with tax 

credits and with subsidies to insurance companies. So, 

with respect to that, the part of the population at 

100 percent of poverty to 133 percent of poverty, the --

the statute actually has an alternative for them. 

For people below 100 percent of poverty, it 

is true that there is no insurance alternative. But by 

the same token, there is no penalty that is going to be 

imposed on anybody in that group.

$9500. So, anybody below $9500, no penalty, because 

they don't have to file an income tax return. The 

sliver of people between $9500 and $10,800 -- the 

question there is, are they going to be able to find 

health insurance that will cost them less than 8 percent 

of their income? And so --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I'm not following this 

argument. Take the poorest of the poor. If there is no 

Medicaid program, then they're not going to get health 

care. Isn't that right? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, that's true. But 

this --

JUSTICE ALITO: And so, Congress obviously 

assumed -- it thought it was inconceivable that any 

State would reject this offer, because the objective of 

the Affordable Care Act is to provide near-universal 

care, and Medicaid is the way to provide care for at 

least the poorest of the poor. So, it just didn't occur 

to them that this was a possibility. When --

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I --

JUSTICE ALITO: When that's the case, how 

can that not be coercion? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, it --

Unless it's just purely a gift. 

And it comes back to the question of whether 

you think it makes a difference that the money -- a lot 

of the money to pay for this is going to come out of the 

same taxpayers that the States have to tax to get their 

money. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: This is -- this is a --

this is -- these are Federal dollars that Congress has 

offered to the States and said we're going to make this 

offer to you, but here's how these dollars need to be 

spent. This is the essence of Congress's Article I 

authority under the General Welfare Clause and the 

Appropriations Clause. This is not some remote 

contingency or an effort to leverage in that regard. 

This is how Congress is going to have the Federal 

Government's money be used if States choose to accept 

it. 

Yes, it was reasonable for Congress to 

predict in this circumstance that the States were going 

to take this money, because -- because it is an 

extremely generous offer of funds: 90-plus percent of 

the funding. States can -- can expand their Medicaid 

coverage to more than 20 percent of their population for 

an increase of only 1 percent --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I recognize the problem 

with that test. 

11  GENERAL VERRILLI: I would go back to the 

12 fact that 60 percent of the Medicaid spending is now 

13 optional. It's -- it's a result of choices that States 

14 have made that â€“ itâ€™s expanded the â€“ their own applications. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even though they're now 

16 frozen in, per our earlier discussion, to a large extent. 

17  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, no, to a much more 

18 modest extent was my point, Justice Kennedy. For 

19 example, optional services where a huge amount of money 

is spent -- more than $100 billion annually -- the 

21 largest component of that is nursing home services. 

22 That remains optional. It's -- right now, once the 

23 minimum -- once the maintenance-of-effort provision 

24 remains in place, States have the flexibility to reduce 

that -- those numbers.

States have considerable flexibility now and 

going forward with respect to the way that money is 

spent. And I do think in terms of evaluating whether 

this expansion should be considered coercive, itâ€™s got 

to be evaluated against the backdrop of the fact that 

the States are generally -- are generally taking 

advantage of the opportunities of this statute to 

greatly expand the amount of money that the Federal 

Government spends and the amount of money that they 

spend to try to make the -- the lives of their citizens 

better. I think it's very --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, they have to do 

so by hiring a very substantial number of more 

employees. There will be State employees. There'll be 

substantial State administrative expenses that are not 

reimbursed. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, but -- I would take 

issue with that, Justice Kennedy. Part of the 

Affordable Care Act is that it -- it provides for new 

streamlined eligibility processes to get people into the 

system at a -- at a much faster and cheaper rate. There 

are going to be costs to set that up. But under the 

statute, the Federal Government is going to pay 

90 percent of those costs, the short-term set-up costs. 

And then all of the projections that we have

GENERAL VERRILLI: -- on the administrative 

6 side. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Obviously, the 

8 Federal Government isn't bound to that. And what if, 

9 after the 90 percent, they say, well, now -- from now 

on, for the States -- we're going to pay 70 percent? 

11 What happens then? Where does that extra money come from? 

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think -- then --

13 then the States would have a choice at that -- at that 

14 point whether they were going to stay in the program or 

not. But that isn't what we have here, and --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no -- they 

17 can just bail out as soon -- whenever the government 

18 reduces the amount of the percentage --

21 to pay, the States can say that's -- that's --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh. 

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: Right. That that would 

8  be the option. They can leave Medicaid if they decide 

9  that that isn't working for them. I'm saying -- I'm not 

saying this is an easy choice. I'm also not saying it 

11  would happen, because the Secretary does have this 

12  discretion. So --

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the Secretary 

14  has the discretion. We're talking about something else. 

We're talking about fiscal realities and whether or not 

16  the Federal Government is going to say we need to lower 

17  our contribution to Medicaid and leave it up to the 

18  States because we want the people to be mad at the 

19  States when they have to have all these budget cuts to 

keep it up, and not at the Federal Government. 

21  GENERAL VERRILLI: But that would be true, 

22  Mr. Chief Justice, whether this Medicaid expansion 

23  occurred or not. So --

4  to pay a lot less, and you, States, are still on the 

hook, because you don't -- you say it's not an easy 

6  choice. We can say -- ask whether it's coercion. 

7  You're not going to be able to bail out of Medicaid. 

8  You just have to pay more because we're going to pay 

9  less. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, like I said, I -- I 

11  agree that it would be a difficult choice in some 

12  circumstances. But that is not to say it's coercion as 

13  a legal matter or even as a practical matter. And I 

14  think it would depend on what the circumstances were on 

how -- and I think, trying to think about how a court 

16  would ever answer the question of whether it was 

17  coercive, it was too difficult as a practical matter for

4  Dole itself was one of those cases. I think 

every State raised the drinking age to 21; correct? 

6  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, Justice Sotomayor, 

7  and this argument was raised in Dole, and the Court 

8  rejected it as a --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I guess my point is that 

political accountability has two components: What can I 

11  do if I like something, and what can I do if I don't 

12  like something? And if people really like something 

13  like Medicaid, they're not going to let you drop it, 

14  correct? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, the citizens of the 

16  State, but that's the citizens of the State acting --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly. That's the 

18  whole point; that's their choice, right? 

19  GENERAL VERRILLI: -- in their capacity as 

citizens of the State. And I think that's why I get --

21  try to get back to the point, that's why I think this is 

22  wrong to think about this as coercion, because this is a 

23  program that works effectively for the citizens of the 

24  State, and States' governments -- and State governments 

think that, and that's why it has expanded the way it

6  the Dole case. Now, what was the threat in that case, 

7  raise your drinking age to 21 or what? 

8  GENERAL VERRILLI: Or lose a percentage of 

9  your highway funds. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you remember the

you're talking about lose all of your Medicaid funds or 

16  lose -- I thought it was 5, but 7 -- 7 percent of your 

17  highway funds.

19  agree with Your Honor that it -- that it's different, 

but I don't think that that makes coercion as a legal 

21  matter. As I said, I think that this is a situation in

1  provision, the Medicaid expansion that we're talking 

2  about this afternoon and the provisions we talked about 

3  yesterday, we've been talking about them in terms of 

4  their effect as measures that solve problems, problems 

in the economic marketplace, that have resulted in 

6  millions of people not having health care because they 

7  can't afford insurance. 

8  There is an important connection, a profound 

9  connection, between that problem and liberty. And I do 

think it's important that we not lose sight of that. 

11  That in this population of Medicaid eligible people who 

12  will receive health care that they cannot now afford 

13  under this Medicaid expansion, there will be millions of 

14  people with chronic conditions like diabetes and heart 

disease, and as a result of the health care that they 

16  will get, they will be unshackled from the disabilities 

17  that those diseases put on them and have the opportunity 

18  to enjoy the blessings of liberty. 

19  And the same thing will be true for -- for a 

husband whose wife is diagnosed with breast cancer and 

21  who won't face the prospect of being forced into 

22  bankruptcy to try to get care for his wife and face the 

23  risk of having to raise his children alone. And I could 

24  multiply example after example after example. 

In a very fundamental way, this Medicaid

1  expansion, as well as the provisions we discussed 

2  yesterday, secure of the blessings of liberty. And I 

3  think that that is important as the Court is considering 

4  these issues that that be kept in mind. The -- the 

Congress struggled with the issue of how to deal with 

6  this profound problem of 40 million people without 

7  health care for many years, and it made a judgment, and 

8  its judgment is one that is, I think, in conformity with 

9  what lots of expertsâ€™ thought, was the best complex of 

options to handle this problem. 

11  Maybe they were right; maybe they weren't. 

12  But this is something about which the people of the 

13  United States can deliberate and they can vote, and if 

14  they think it needs to be changed, they can change it. 

And I would suggest to the Court, with profound respect 

16  for the Court's obligation to ensure that the Federal 

17  Government remains a government of enumerated powers, 

18  that this is not a case in any of its aspects that calls 

19  that into question. That this was a judgment of policy 

that democratically accountable branches of this 

21  government made by their best lights. 

22  And I would urge this Court to respect that 

23  judgment and ask that the Affordable Care Act, in its 

24  entirety, be upheld. Thank you.

2  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

3  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

4  MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice 

and may it please the Court: 

6  Just a few points in rebuttal. First of all 

7  we've talked a lot about the sort of hallmark of 

8  coercion, your money or your life, with somebody with a 

9  gun. I would respectfully suggest that it is equally 

coercive and certainly not uncoercive if I say your 

11  money or your life -- and by the way, I have discretion 

12  as to whether or not I will shoot the gun. I don't 

13  think that eliminates the coercion. 

14  I also don't think this is a discretion that 

the Secretary would ever be able to exercise. And the 

16  reason is we disagree on the details, but the Solicitor 

17  General and I agree that, over the years, Congress has 

18  had different approaches to expanding Medicare. 

19  Sometimes, as in 1972, it makes the 

expansion voluntary. That's also, by the way, what 

21  happened with the stimulus funds, which were voluntary 

22  funds. You didn't lose all your Medicaid funds, which 

23  is why 17 States could say no. 

24  Sometimes, they take the voluntary approach. 

Sometimes, as in 1984, they take the mandatory approach. 

84

1  If the Secretary exercised the discretion to say, you 

2  know what, it really isn't reasonable for you to have to 

3  give up your funding for the visually impaired and the 

4  disabled, just to cover these newly eligible people, so 

we will make it voluntary; we'll make that 

6  discretionary -- that would essentially be creating --

7  converting a 1984 amendment approach to a 1972 amendment 

8  approach, and I just don't think that is the kind of 

9  discretion that the Secretary has, with all due respect. 

Now, moving on to the next point, 

11  Justice Alito, your hypothetical, I think, aptly 

12  captures the effect on this, based on the fact that 

13  these tax dollars are being taken from the State's tax 

14  base, and it's not like Steward Machine, where the 

Federal Government would say, and oh, by the way, if you 

16  don't take the option we're giving you, we're going to 

17  have a Federal substitute that will go in, and we'll 

18  take care of the unemployed in your State. 

19  Here, if you don't take this offer that 

we're giving you, your tax dollars will fund the other 

21  49 States, and you'll get nothing. 

22  But, of course, this situation is much more 

23  coercive, even than your hypothetical, because it is 

24  tied directly to the mandate. It's also tied to 

the participation in the pre-existing program. So, it's 

85
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1  as if there was yet another program for post-secondary 

2  education; they gave them exactly your option --

3  option -- and then they also said, oh, and by the way, 

4  you not only not get these funds, but you lose the 

post-secondary funds as well. 

6  It's really hard to understand tying the 

7  pre-existing participation in the program as anything 

8  other than coercive. 

9  The Solicitor General makes a lot of the 

fact that there are optional benefits under this 

11  program. Well, guess what? After the Medicaid 

12  expansion, there will be a lot less opportunity for the 

13  States to exercise those options, because one of the 

14  things that the expansion does -- precisely because the 

expansion is designed to convert Medicaid into a program 

16  that satisfies the requirement of the minimum essential 

17  coverage of the individual mandate, things that used to 

18  be voluntary will no longer be voluntary. 

19  The perfect example is prescription 

coverage. That's a big part of the benefits that some 

21  States, but not all, provide voluntarily now. It will 

22  no longer be voluntary after the expansion because the 

23  Federal Government has deemed prescription drugs to be 

24  part of the minimal essential health coverage that 

everybody in this country must have under the mandate.

1  So, that option that the State has is being removed by 

2  the expansion itself. 

3  The Chief Justice made the point --

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Clement, may I ask 

one question about your bottom line in this case? It 

6  sounds to me like everything you said would be to the 

7  effect of, if Congress continued to do things on a 

8  voluntary basis, so with adding these new eligibles, 

9  and say, States, you can have it or not, you can 

preserve the program as it existed before, you can opt 

11  into this. 

12  But you're not asking the Court as relief to 

13  say, well, that's how we -- that's how we cure the 

14  constitutional infirmity; we say this has to be on a 

voluntary basis. Instead, you are arguing that this 

16  whole Medicaid -- the addition, that the whole expansion 

17  has to be nullified and, moreover, the entire Health 

18  Care Act. Instead of having the easy repair, you say 

19  that if we accept your position, everything falls. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, if we 

21  can start with the common ground that there's a need for 

22  a repair because there is a coercion doctrine and this 

23  statute is coercion, then we're into the question of 

24  remedy. And we do think -- we do take the position that 

you describe in the remedy, but we would be certainly

25

Official 

1  happy if we got something here, and we got a recognition 

2  that the coercion doctrine exists; this is coercive; and 

3  we get the remedy that you suggest in the alternative. 

4  Let me just finish by saying that I 

certainly appreciate what the Solicitor General says, 

6  that when you support a policy, you think that the 

7  policy spreads the blessings of liberty. But I would 

8  respectfully suggest that it's a very funny conception 

9  of liberty that forces somebody to purchase an insurance 

policy whether they want it or not. 

11  And it's a very strange conception of 

12  federalism that says that we can simply give the States 

13  an offer that they can't refuse, and through the 

14  spending power, which is premised on the notion that 

Congress can do more -- because it's voluntary, we can 

16  force the States to do whatever we tell them to. That 

17  is a direct threat to our federalism. 

18  Thank you.
