3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

4 argument next this morning in case 10-235, CSX 

Transportation v. McBride. 

6  Mr. Rothfeld. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

11  In this case we find ourselves in the happy 

12 situation of having to try to convince the Court that 

13 its prior decisions were correct. Just 5 years after 

14 the enactment of FELA, the Court declared that it was 

obvious that the statute contained a proximate cause 

16 requirement. The Court went on to repeat that 

17 conclusion over and over again in almost two dozen 

18 decisions over the next 40 years. Our submission this 

19 morning is that the Court when it made these statements 

got it right. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: How did it happen that in 

22 FELA we have proximate cause light? It's just a 

23 different proximate cause than we see in other -- in 

24 other torts cases. How -- how did that come about?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, we -- we -- our 

3

5

15

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 submission is that that is not correct, that that is not 

2 what FELA provides for at all. And in the Court's 

3 initial decisions, the ones that I referred to, it 

4 stated very clearly that the ordinary proximate cause 

rule applies. The -- the proximate cause test that the 

6 Court stated in cases like Brady was the traditional 

7 proximate cause standard. 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you read the cases as 

9 indicating that more deference is given to juries in 

FELA cases than in other cases? 

11  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that's -- is a 

12 separate one from the one we have here. I mean, we are 

13 talking here about the nature of the -- the elements of 

14 the cause of action that have to be demonstrated by -­

by the plaintiff; and so there -- the question of how 

16 much of that evidence there has to be to get to the jury 

17 is a separate question that's not presented here. 

18  Our submission, since you posed the 

19 question, is that there is no different standard; that 

FELA was not intended to depart from the ordinary common 

21 law procedural approaches in that respect, either. 

22  But on the question that's presented -­

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: But juries usually find 

24 against railroads anyway, right?

 MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I wouldn't want to 

4

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 commit myself to answering that question affirmatively, 

2 Your Honor. 

3  The Court has said that -- that FELA was 

4 enacted to address particular problems in the 

administration of the common law prior to 1908. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It also said that there's 

7 a relaxed standard of causation. I think that's what 

8 Justice Kennedy is referring to when he said "proximate 

9 cause light." But we have said in more than one case 

that there is a relaxed standard of causation in FELA 

11 cases. Was that wrong? 

12  MR. ROTHFELD: I think there are two ways to 

13 respond to that, Justice Ginsburg. The first is that up 

14 until the Rogers decision, which is -- which is one of 

the ones which has created I think some confusion in 

16 this area, the Court was quite clear and unambiguous 

17 that proximate cause in FELA applied in the ordinary 

18 sense. 

19  As I say, in cases like the Brady case the 

Court stated what proximate cause means; it stated in -­

21 in entirely traditional terms that -- that the plaintiff 

22 had to demonstrate that the injury followed in a 

23 natural, probable foreseeable way from the wrongful 

24 conduct, and so that -- that was the standard.

 The Rogers case, which was the source of 

5

10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 some of the confusion in this area, in our view, as -­

2 as we think Justice Souter correctly demonstrated in his 

3 opinion in Sorrell, and as we explain at some length in 

4 our brief, Rogers we think did not address causation at 

all. The Rogers case was a situation in which there 

6 were a multiplicity of causes, and the question was what 

7 -- what should -- should the rule be when there are a 

8 number of -- of entities that contribute to the 

9 accident. It had nothing to do with remoteness or 

directness of the cause, what we usually think about 

11 when we talk about proximate cause. 

12  In -- in the years since Rogers was decided, 

13 when the Court -- got out of the business of deciding 

14 FELA cases on the facts, it had not had occasion on -­

in any case to address specifically what proximate cause 

16 meant in the FELA context. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -­

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we have used that 

19 language. You -- you have not responded to -- to the 

question where -- where did this language that does 

21 appear in our -- in our cases about the relaxed 

22 standard, where -- where does that come from? 

23  MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that comes from, W 

24 submit, from sort of a loose description of what was 

going on in the Rogers case, which involved a 

6
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 multiplicity of causes rather than directness and 

2 remoteness of causes, and so the cases in which that 

3 language appears, which are the Crane case and the 

4 Gottshall case, did not involve causation at all. The 

question of causation was not presented to the Court in 

6 those cases. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It has nothing to do with 

8 the line of cases I think in the '40s in the FELA cases 

9 where the message of this Court seemed to be quite 

clear, FELA cases go to juries? There are a number of 

11 cases with reverse dissents that seem to -- to say just 

12 that. 

13  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that goes to 

14 the question that Justice Kennedy raised at the outset, 

which is how much evidence, whatever the standard of 

16 causation is, how much evidence must there be to go to 

17 the jury? And our presentation here is that FELA did 

18 not change the ordinary standard on -- on that question. 

19 But that -- but that is not the question that's 

presented in this case. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what -- can you 

22 explain to me -- I mean, here the judge charged in the 

23 words of the statute, and they are also the words used 

24 in the model Federal instruction: Did plaintiff's 

injury result in whole or in part from the railroad's 

7

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 negligence? 

2  You would say: Was plaintiff's injury 

3 proximately caused. And as you no doubt know, 

4 Mr. Rothfeld, that term "proximate cause," it just loses 

juries. So considering that these cases go to the jury, 

6 what do you say to the instruction that's now given, 

7 based on the words of the statute, "Did plaintiff's 

8 injury result in whole or part from the railroad's 

9 negligence"? What should the judge charge instead of 

that? 

11  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think there are -­

12 there are two parts to your question, Justice Ginsburg. 

13 One -- one is, what's wrong with the instruction that 

14 was given here; and the other is can juries understand 

proximate cause as a concept. 

16  On -- on the first point, we have no 

17 objection to the instruction containing the language of 

18 the statute. The problem is that to be comprehensible 

19 and intelligently applied by jurors, it has to say more 

than that. Proximate cause we submit is an element of 

21 the cause of action and that has to be explained to a 

22 jury. It couldn't be the case in a Sherman Act case, 

23 for example, that a judge could simply charge the jury: 

24 You are to determine whether there has been an 

unreasonable restraint of trade; now go to the jury room

1 and answer that question. There is a lot more that has 

2 to go into that cause of action, including, as it 

3 happens, proximate cause. 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Rothfeld, could you 

explain to me how it would have made a difference in 

6 this case, that instruction? 

7  MR. ROTHFELD: It -- it would have made a 

8 difference I guess in two respects. One is that the 

9 plaintiff's theory has never at any point been that 

there was proximate cause in this case. He did not 

11 contend that there was before the -- the district court 

12 and he does not contend in his brief before this Court 

13 that there was proximate cause made out. And so -­

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, maybe explain the 

difference. I mean, you were answering my question, and 

16 I asked how would you tell the jury? You said it's okay 

17 to say: Did plaintiff's injury result in whole or in 

18 part from the railroad's negligence, but the judge must 

19 say something more. So what is the something more?

 MR. ROTHFELD: The something more is what 

21 this Court said in its Brady decision, in which it 

22 described -- the decision in Brady, which is cited and 

23 discussed in our opening brief in -- in some detail. 

24 Brady described what proximate cause means in the FELA 

context; and it means, the Court said, that there must 

9

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 be a demonstration that the plaintiff's injury resulted 

2 from the wrongful conduct in a way that was natural, 

3 probable, and foreseeable. That -- that was a 

4 traditional statement, is still today a traditional 

statement of proximate cause. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Natural, probable, and 

7 foreseeable? 

8  MR. ROTHFELD: And foreseeable. That -­

9 that language was taken in the Brady case directly from 

the Court's decision, 1876 decision in the Kellogg 

11 decision, which we also cite in our brief, which states 

12 -­

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me -- there 

14 is an article that suggests that juries don't actually 

understand what "proximate cause" means; and I think, 

16 and Justice Ginsburg can correct me, that what does that 

17 mean to a jury -- natural, probable, and foreseeable? 

18  MR. ROTHFELD: Well -­

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are the three phrases 

different? And how much more detail do you have to get 

21 in to describe that difference in a comprehensible way? 

22  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that was the 

23 second part of Justice Ginsburg's question, and I got 

24 distracted, and I'm happy to address it. I think most 

of the criticism of proximate cause as being confusion

1 to the jury has actually been directed at the word 

2 "proximate," that commentators and some courts have said 

3 that's a confusing word, it suggests immediacy, it 

4 suggests closeness in time, it sounds like 

"approximate," and so juries find it confusing. 

6  But there is -- once it's spelled out, I 

7 mean, the fact is juries have been applying proximate 

8 cause, which has been a fundamental, settled, universal, 

9 universally accepted part of common law of torts, in the 

medicine context in particular, and it has been settled 

11 for 150 years. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Apparently only FELA juries 

13 cannot understand it; all other juries find it okay. 

14  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- it is our 

submission that FELA juries would have no more 

16 difficulty applying it than do juries under the Sherman 

17 Act or RICO or the securities laws or, the other 

18 statutes that this Court has said include a proximate 

19 cause requirement, or that juries apply every day in 

courts across the country in court cases. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I just don't -- and 

22 maybe this has already been asked, but I'm not sure from 

23 a juror's perspective that it makes terribly much 

24 difference the exact formulation of this instruction. I 

think a juror who sees an employee is suing the 

11

1 railroad, and it turns out that what the railroad did 

2 had very little or nothing to do with what happened to 

3 the employee, they don't need an instruction about 

4 natural, foreseeable causes. They're just not going to 

give the awards, or they're going to give the awards 

6 even though the railroad didn't do anything that 

7 affected the employee. 

8  It's a -- it's a nuance that I just don't 

9 think has any practical significance.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, we have to assume that 

11 juries follow jury instructions. That's the fundamental 

12 premise of the system, and there is no reason to doubt 

13 that in the ordinary case, in which the contents of 

14 proximate cause are -- are explained to the jury in an 

intelligent -- in a way that -- that people can 

16 comprehend. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Your client is entitled to 

18 have the jury disregard a proper instruction, right? 

19 That's what you're arguing?

 MR. ROTHFELD: If the -- if the jury -­

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Juries disregard 

22 instructions on probable cause, on proximate cause. 

23 They probably do it in non-FELA cases, too. 

24  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're entitled to have

1 them disregard the correct instruction rather than an 

2 incorrect instruction, right? 

3  MR. ROTHFELD: I will endorse that. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is that I 

don't see much practical difference between what you 

6 argue is the correct instruction and what your friend 

7 argues is the correct instruction. 

8  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, certainly, in terms -­

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, law 

students, professors, and some judges have had trouble 

11 defining the concept of proximate cause for centuries. 

12 I don't know why we expect a juror to be able to 

13 navigate through those nuances, either. 

14  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- the -- the 

principle of proximate cause, the idea that there has to 

16 be some limitation beyond but-for causation on 

17 liability, has been universally recognized. Recognized 

18 by -- by courts, by this Court, by commentators, by the 

19 Restatement. The Third Restatement, just published, 

clearly endorsed it. They use -- they quibble about the 

21 terminology, but they clearly endorsed the absolute 

22 necessity of a proximate cause limitation on liability. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think that over the 

24 last few decades, there's been an increasing emphasis on 

foreseeability as a component of proximate cause? 

13

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1  MR. ROTHFELD: There -- there probably has 

2 been. I mean, I'll defer again to the Third 

3 Restatement, which has a very useful summary of the 

4 course of the law in this area. And the principal tests 

that are now being used by courts are foreseeability and 

6 directness, which are closely related, I think. I mean, 

7 clearly, as this Court stated just this month in the 

8 Stout case, it stated a test of proximate cause in terms 

9 of whether -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you give some 

11 examples of what causes would be proximate and what 

12 causes would not so qualify? Something that's -- you 

13 said but-for is no good. So what would be a but-for 

14 cause but not a proximate cause?

 MR. ROTHFELD: A but-for cause in this 

16 context would be, there's a defective brake on -- on the 

17 locomotive and it comes to a sudden stop. If the 

18 conductor, standing in the locomotive when the train 

19 stops, is thrown to the floor and injured, clearly that 

is proximate cause. It -- it is -- it is an injury that 

21 is related to the risk that made the conduct actionable 

22 in the first place. 

23  The reason that having defective brakes is 

24 negligent and gives rise to a cause of action is because 

it can cause an accident that will cause people to fall,

1 cause the train to hit something, will cause derailment. 

2 That's why it is negligent, and if the kind of injury 

3 that follows from the accident is related to that risk, 

4 that clearly is proximate cause.

 The kind which is not would be, train stops 

6 because of the defective brake. No one is injured. 

7 Conductor gets off the train to walk along and see 

8 what's going on, trips and turns his leg, or is bitten 

9 by a snake.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Rothfeld, are there any 

11 cases like that in the FELA world? You know, I take it 

12 that this basic instruction that was given in this case 

13 is the instruction that's given in most cases. If you 

14 look across the range of cases, do you find jurors 

awarding damages in the kind of situation that you're 

16 talking about? In other words, is this a real-world 

17 problem? 

18  MR. ROTHFELD: They did in precisely the 

19 case I just described, a case called Richards from the 

Sixth Circuit, which is cited in the amicus brief 

21 submitted by the Association of American Railroads. The 

22 train stops because of a defective brake, the conductor 

23 gets off, walks along, turns his ankle and sues. 

24  Clearly, the risk of someone getting off the 

train and having a fortuitous injury is not the kind of 

15

5

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 risk that gave rise to the negligence. I mean, it's 

2 negligent to have a defective brake, but not because 

3 there's a bystander who might be bitten by a snake or 

4 turn -- turn his ankle.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there a case like that? 

6  MR. ROTHFELD: As I said, the Richards case. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I mean somebody 

8 might think that having to go off and patrol a thing in 

9 a rough area is something that happens with a sudden 

stop: You run a risk of turning your leg. 

11  I agree with you about the snake. Is there 

12 any case about the snake? 

13  MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I can't cite you a snake 

14 case directly, but -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So the furthest -­

16 the furthest -- the furthest that you go is the case of 

17 sudden stop in the wilderness, gets off, rough area, and 

18 twists his ankle. 

19  MR. ROTHFELD: Or I'll -- I'll cite you -­

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know. Is that 

21 proximate cause or not? Maybe it isn't. 

22  MR. ROTHFELD: I'll give you two answers to 

23 that, Your Honor. First of all, there are other cases. 

24 Another case, for example, cited in the amicus brief 

that I referred to is the Schlumpert case from Georgia, 

16

1 in which there's a defective coupling device lying on 

2 the ground. If it had -- if it had fallen off the train 

3 because it was defective and fallen on someone's foot, 

4 clearly that's proximate cause. But it's on the ground. 

The employee comes along, picks it up, throws off -­

6 throws off his -- throws out his back, and sues. That 

7 is not the kind of -- of injury that one would foresee 

8 comes from having defective couplers. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And do you want -­

what instruction would you give that would tell the jury 

11 to allow damages in one of those -- the first of the 

12 coupling cases, but not in the second? 

13  MR. ROTHFELD: The instruction we ask for is 

14 the one this Court gave -- said should be given in the 

Brady case: Natural, foreseeable, and probable. It is 

16 not -­

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are jurors going to 

18 sit there and say, one of those is natural, foreseeable, 

19 and probable, but the other isn't?

 MR. ROTHFELD: I would -- I would say that 

21 it is -­

23 "natural" means. You know, so it's not a supernatural

1  MR. ROTHFELD: Well -- well, I'm just 

2 quoting the Court's language to you, Your Honor. But -­

3 but certainly, foreseeable and probable, one would say 

4 that -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not foreseeable 

6 that if you drop a coupling where it's not supposed to 

7 be, somebody will come along and try to pick it up and 

8 move it? 

9  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, but it's not 

foreseeable in the sense that it is unrelated to the 

11 risk that gave rise to -- to the cause of action in the 

12 first place. I mean, it's foreseeable in the sense that 

13 anything is foreseeable. 

14  If I give the classic example: I drive -- I 

drive you to New York, from Washington to New York, and 

16 I drive too fast, exceeding the speed limit. That's 

17 negligent. It's negligent because I run the risk, if I 

18 drive too fast, of hitting somebody, of hitting another 

19 car, of driving off the road. And so if I do that and 

you're injured as I drive you to New York, you can sue 

21 me. 

22  But that doesn't happen. I drive -- I get 

23 to New York safely, you get out of the car, and as soon 

24 as you get out, you are struck by lightning. It's a 

but-for cause of your being struck by lightning that I

1 drove too fast. You wouldn't have been there when the 

2 lightning struck. 

3  JUSTICE BREYER: You could have been bitten 

4 by a snake when you're getting out of t car.

 (Laughter.) 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: But there has been no such 

7 case, to your knowledge? 

8  MR. ROTHFELD: Or -- or, more likely, you 

9 could have been hit -- hit by a car driving across Fifth 

Avenue too fast. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Rothfeld, your 

12 instruction actually used the term "probable cause." 

13 Are you -- "proximate cause." Are you saying now that 

14 that's not necessary, that as long as you say 

"reasonable and foreseeable," you would be satisfied? 

16  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that it should 

17 include the term "proximate" simply because that has 

18 traditionally been the requirement. That's what this 

19 Court has said in cases like Brady. It's what the Court 

has said in cases applying other proximate cause -­

21 other elements of proximate causation in other 

22 circumstances. But it is the concept. 

23  I mean, as I said, "proximate" is a

18 we -- we endorse, again, the test that this Court has 

19 stated in the FELA context very clearly in the Brady 

case. There are -- as has been noted in some of the 

21 questioning, there has been discussion between courts 

22 and commentators over the years about what the best way 

23 is to define proximate cause and explain it to the jury.

the Chief Justice, does it actually make any difference,

1 I think not only do we have to assume that it makes a 

2 difference, because juries are presumed to follow their 

3 instructions, but the kind of instruction that was given

find that -- that in any respect, the injuries

9  JUSTICE ALITO: Could you explain how it 

might have made a difference in this particular case 

11 based on the facts of the case? As I understand it, 

12 Mr. McBride's theory was that as a result of having to 

13 use the independent brake extensively over a long period 

14 of time with this wide-bodied cab, his hand got tired 

and it fell, and it hit the independent brake. 

16  Is that -- that's the theory? 

17  MR. ROTHFELD: Well -- that -- that -­

18 that's his explanation of the accident. The theory of 

19 negligence, as I understand it, as it was presented to 

the jury by his expert was that the configuration of the 

21 train that he was driving was unsafe because it -- it 

22 could lead to derailments, it could lead to breaking of 

23 the couplers. 

24  As explained by his expert, the -- the 

theory was not that there was something unsafe about the 

21

1 arrangement of the braking system, and so, I think that 

2 the -- the way in which a proximate cause instruction 

3 properly given here could have made a difference is that 

4 the jury could have found, well, yes, it was negligent 

to have these five locomotives arranged in the way that 

6 they were, but that had nothing to do, except in a but­

7 for sense, with the fact that the -- the -- that 

8 Mr. McBride's hand was injured; that the jury could have 

9 made that determination and so it could have made a 

difference. 

11  Now, I mean, the fact is there was no 

12 proximate cause argument made below because the 

13 instruction that was given by the district court 

14 excluded it. And so, as I said before, the -- the 

theory of the case advanced by Mr. McBride below simply 

16 didn't take account of proximate cause. 

17  Now, if the -- if we prevail here and the 

18 case goes back, he will be free to argue under a proper 

19 instruction that there was proximate cause, that somehow 

the configuration of the train affected his -- his 

21 handling of the brake. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're really suggesting 

23 that the defense attorney here wouldn't have argued the 

24 concept of proximate cause in saying the negligence had 

nothing to do with him just deciding to hit the brake?

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I -- I -- I -- it's 

3 farfetched, don't you think, that because the judge 

4 refused to give a proximate cause charge that the idea 

of it wasn't argued to the jury: What we did didn't 

6 cause this. 

7  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, there -- there is no 

8 question that what the railroad did caused in the but­

9 for sense. Mr. McBride would not have been in the cab 

operating the brake system had it -- had it not been for 

11 the configuration of the -- of the locomotives. And, so 

12 if we assume that the configuration of the locomotives 

13 was negligent, then but for the negligence of -- of the 

14 railroad, this would not have occurred. And that in 

fact is -- is the terms in which the case was argued to 

16 the jury by Mr. McBride's lawyer, who said, in so many 

17 words: But for the negligence of the railroad, this 

18 would not have occurred. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: So the -- but the question 

is, what was your argument? What was your side's 

21 argument? Did you argue, in effect, proximate cause? 

22  MR. ROTHFELD: Our side argued that there 

23 was no negligence at all, that -- that -- that the 

24 configuration of the railroad was perfectly proper, and 

that -- the -- the -- there was a contributory

1 negligence component to what was going on here. In 

2 fact, the jury found that Mr. McBride was contributorily 

3 negligent in part, and that was part of the -- of the 

4 defense presentation, too.

 But just two or three -- to take a step back 

6 to first principles, on the assumption that proximate 

7 cause -- that there is a difference between instructing 

8 the jury on proximate cause and not, because the court 

9 -- it has been a part of tort law, you know, for time 

immemorial on the assumption that it does make a 

11 difference and it has been an important part of tort law 

12 because it has been universally recognized by courts, by 

13 academics, by the Respondent that there has to be some 

14 limitation on liability beyond but-for causation. If 

there is not, there is the danger of sort of infinite 

16 liability, of limitless liability, and particularly of 

17 fortuitous liability, because there is no way that the 

18 defendant in a situation like this can anticipate that 

19 it's going to be held liable for this kind of injury.

 So proximate cause has been regarded as an 

21 essential component of the tort law. And that being so, 

22 FELA creates a Federal cause of action for negligence, 

23 it creates a Federal tort. It -- a fundamental 

24 principle of statutory interpretation, this Court has 

applied many times, most recently just this month in the

11  MR. ROTHFELD: There are -- there are 

12 Federal statutes that use the word "proximate." I don't 

13 know that there are any negligence statutes. So far as 

14 I understand from our review of the law, at the time 

that Congress enacted FELA in 1908, there -- there were 

16 no such statutes that made use of the term "proximate." 

17  And the presumption then, as now, is that 

18 when Congress creates what amounted to a Federal tort, 

19 the assumption is that it intends to adopt a background 

of tort law. That was true in the Sherman Act, it was 

21 true in RICO, it was true in securities laws, it was 

22 true just as earlier this month in the Staub case, a 

23 statute which did not use the term "proximate."

1 right? 

2  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that's -- that's right. 

3 Given the instruction that the jury received, which does 

4 not -- did not include a proximate cause requirement, 

and given that if one assumes that there was negligence, 

6 there is no doubt that the -- that the injury here was 

7 the but-for product of that negligence, there sort of 

8 was no room for negligence to be argued to the jury on 

9 the defense side. I mean, for proximate -- for -­

for -- for causation to be argued on the defense side. 

11  JUSTICE ALITO: Assume you could talk to the 

12 jury and the jury says to you: We found negligence, so 

13 we don't want to hear about that; and we've found but­

14 for causation and we don't want to hear about that; now, 

explain to us why there isn't proximate cause here? 

16 What more -- what -- what would you say? 

17  MR. ROTHFELD: In -- in this case we would 

18 say the negligence that is being presented to you and 

19 that you have presumably found is that the configuration 

of these locomotives was dangerous because it could lead 

21 to derailment, it could lead to breaking of the couplers 

22 between the cars. That is the negligence. And 

23 proximate cause, properly understood, means that the 

24 injury on which the plaintiff is suing has to follow in 

a probable, natural, foreseeable way from that -- that

1 negligence. 

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: But wasn't the theory 

3 different, Mr. Rothfeld? Wasn't the theory that the 

4 configuration of the train made the braking and the 

switching much more difficult for the person in this 

6 position? 

7  MR. ROTHFELD: Well, if I may, I'll answer 

8 that and then sit down. 

9  That, as I say, was not the theory that was 

presented by the plaintiff's expert. To the extent that 

11 that is -- is a viable theory, it could be presented on 

12 remand. The argument can be made. I think it's a 

13 difficult argument, but -- but it was not presented to 

14 the jury here because there was no proximate cause 

instruction, so there was no opportunity for the

24  This case is a case that presents a 

non-existent problem and a solution that is in search of

1 a non-existent problem, because there are no real 

2 reported cases where there have been problems arising 

3 under the Rogers instructions that have become the model 

4 instructions under the Federal Rules for over 50 years.

 And if could I just begin, Justice Kennedy, 

6 with your question which opened this up, proximate cause 

7 serves two principal functions. One is to limit the 

8 scope of the persons to whom the tortfeasor owes a duty; 

9 and the second is to limit the kinds of injuries that 

that person would be liable for. 

11  The innovation in FELA that is so important 

12 to understand about why the relaxed causation standard 

13 became the accepted standard under FELA was that FELA, 

14 by its plain terms, did away with the first concept of 

proximate cause because it limited the duty to the 

16 employee by the employer. There is no one outside of 

17 that relationship that can bring an action under FELA. 

18  And the second thing that it did was it put 

19 into what is now section 51 that if the negligence 

results in, quote, "in whole or in part" from the 

21 negligence of the railroad, that is enough for injury. 

22 At common law the proximate cause standard required that 

23 the railroad's negligence be the sole cause. So the 

24 innovation that created the relaxation in the causation 

standard was the inclusion of these words in part, and

1 so over time -­

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the other side 

3 says that what that meant, and -- and -- and the 

4 language of our cases seems to support that, "in whole 

or in part" simply eliminated the common law doctrine of 

6 contributory negligence, whereby if the plaintiff also 

7 had been negligent, the plaintiff could not recover, 

8 and -- and FELA uses a -- a -- a comparative negligence 

9 standard.

 MR. FREDERICK: And this Court has rejected 

11 that kind of approach almost from the beginning of the 

12 statute. In Campbell in 1916, the Court asked whether 

13 FELA has completely eliminated the idea of proximate 

14 cause. The Court has eliminated and the plain language 

precludes the sole cause, immediate cause, direct cause, 

16 last cause, substantial factor -­

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't "in whole or in 

18 part" apply to the elimination of contributory 

19 negligence? Isn't that an adequate explanation for the 

language? 

21  MR. FREDERICK: It's -- it's not one that's 

22 consistent with the Court's cases. And let me point you 

23 back to the day Rogers was decided. If we accept for 

24 purposes of argument -- and I'm only accepting it for 

these purposes -- that Rogers was only about multiple

1 causes, on the very same day it decided two other cases 

2 that arguably were only about single causes. It decided 

3 a case under the Jones Act, the Ferguson case, and it 

4 decided another case under FELA, the Webb case. In both 

of those cases, there were no multiple causes, there was 

6 no contributory negligence; but what the Court said was 

7 that on today we are announcing this standard, we apply 

8 that standard to overturn directed verdicts where juries 

9 had come to the conclusion that the railroad's 

negligence had played a part, even a slight one, in 

11 producing the injury sustained by the worker.

13 phrase in the statute "in whole or in part" allows 

14 juries to impose liability based on but-for causation?

 MR. FREDERICK: No. The -­

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why -- why not?

7  MR. FREDERICK: Because there the railroad's 

8 negligence played no part in producing the jury. It's 

9 the producing aspect that provides a little bit more -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure it did. The train 

11 wouldn't have stopped, the conductor wouldn't have

on 42nd Street when the lightning struck. I mean, how 

16 can you say it didn't play a part? Of course it played 

17 a part. 

18  MR. FREDERICK: It was certainly an element 

19 of the existence of the condition. But what the Court's 

cases, Justice Scalia, after Rogers have done, and I 

21 think this is an important part of the history, is that 

22 there are a couple of outlier cases, to be sure. Courts 

23 have corrected them all by saying that the judge -- that 

24 the jury could not have reasonably found based on common 

experience that this snake bite or what have you was

3 I read the statute, it insists, as interpreted in

courts have read it. I'm not sure; you know. And I

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes.

1 anything? How can you possibly say that negligence 

2 didn't play a part? It obviously did. It seems to me 

3 you're arguing for -- not the nonexistence of proximate 

4 cause. Nobody in his right mind could argue for the 

nonexistence of proximate cause. You are arguing for 

6 some different -- different definition of proximate 

7 cause, and I would like to know what that -- what that 

8 new definition is, as opposed to the definition that Mr. 

9 Rothfeld proposed.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, let me start with this 

11 by saying that the Court and the language of the statute 

12 have already eliminate six possibilities for proximate 

13 cause; and the question now is whether there's something 

14 additive to the words that Mr. Rothfeld now proposes for 

the first time, because this was not language that they 

16 proposed in their proffered jury instruction, which can 

17 be found in the red brief at page 11. There they 

18 followed the Illinois proposed instruction which says 

19 "natural or probable sequence." That language does not 

appear in Brady. In Brady, a 1943 case from this Court, 

21 the words are used "natural and probable consequence," a 

22 consequence, of course, being a result, a sequence being 

23 an order of events. 

24  Now, their instruction rests on the word 

"probable," which of course in common understanding and 

33
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 most juries would commonly understand, "probable" means 

2 more likely than not, which is directly in contention 

3 with the statutory words "in part," and directly 

4 contrary to the way courts had universally understood 

this language since Rogers. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know if they said 

7 this, but I mean, as I read it, I thought the reason 

8 that negligence doesn't play a part is the act which was 

9 negligent played a part, of course; it was "but for"; 

but the fact that it is negligent is totally irrelevant, 

11 because it's not within the risk in any sense 

12 whatsoever.

14 -- don't just agree with me because I'm saying it. Is 

that roughly the -­

16  MR. FREDERICK: That is correct, Justice 

17 Breyer. And in the cases -- and there really are only a 

18 few cases where you can find these kind of outlier facts 

19 and these kind of, you know, "out there" situations, and 

one of the reasons is because FELA is only a 

21 compensatory damages statute. It only addresses the 

22 actual injury and the compensation for the worker. 

23 There are no punitive damages, there are no attorney's 

24 fees, there are no treble damages.

2 the wide locomotive; therefore, there should be 

3 liability. What -- and assume the jury has all of the 

4 Federal reports in there and the judge lets them read. 

What -- what is there for another juror to say that this 

6 is wrong? 

7  MR. FREDERICK: The negligence theory here, 

8 Justice Kennedy, if I could go back to that, was not 

9 stated in a way that we would subscribe to by -- by Mr. 

Rothfeld. Our theory of negligence at trial was 

11 twofold. 

12  One was that these wide-boded locomotives 

13 were not appropriate for the switching exercise that the 

14 train men were doing on that day, and in fact the 

supervising engineer said this was the only time that he 

16 was aware in his long experience where these wide-body 

17 locomotives were used for this specific purpose which 

18 required a lot of braking activity. 

19  The second theory of negligence was that Mr. 

McBride was put to this purpose without proper training. 

21 He has complained on the day; he was uncomfortable and 

22 he didn't know whether he could operate that locomotive; 

23 and the jury was entitled reasonably to infer that that

2  MR. FREDERICK: Because -­

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You've used the 

4 formulation negligence played a part in the injury. So 

how did those things play a part? 

6  MR. FREDERICK: His -- let's start with his 

7 poor training. There was testimony that a person who 

8 was more skilled in the art of dealing with a wide-boded 

9 locomotive would be able to manipulate the independent 

brake with the automatic brake in a way that would not 

11 cause the repetitive stress that Mr. McBride suffered. 

12 And there was further testimony that using a wide-body 

13 locomotive, which is more difficult to manipulate for 

14 the switching operations, and here we're talking about 

moving in and off main tracks to couple trains, train 

16 cars so that they can be used for a longer 

17 destination -- that that kind of equipment was not 

18 suited for the purpose. 

19  Mr. McBride's testimony was when he had used 

the wide-body locomotive, he had done so on long trips 

21 over long distances that didn't require the same kind of 

22 ready, manipulative braking of the independent brake. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: And you don't assert that 

24 that's a foreseeable consequence of the negligence of 

using a wide-body train?

12 if defendant's negligence played a part no matter how

injury was caused by negligence."

22  MR. FREDERICK: Those words mean that "but 

23 for" plus a relaxed form of legal cause associating the 

24 negligence in playing a part in produce the injury. 

That's how Rogers understood it.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Negligence is a given; the 

2 negligence is not what I'm asking about. I'm asking 

3 about causality, and what you have just read is "but 

4 for" cause.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I would disagree with 

6 that Justice Scalia, and I think the Rogers Court 

7 disagreed with that too, because after Rogers this Court 

8 upheld in Inman a case on a directed verdict where it 

9 concluded after the Rogers instructions had been used 

that nonetheless the negligence of the railroad had not 

11 played a part. That's a case involving a drunk driver 

12 who hit a flag man at the site of where the flag man was 

13 operating. 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I -- can I go back a 

second and perhaps follow up Justice Scalia's question 

16 in a slightly different way? Do you believe a railroad 

17 can be held liable for a harm it could not reasonably 

18 foresee? 

19  MR. FREDERICK: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Now, 

21 perhaps, we can get to why, under what formulation, if 

22 it didn't know harm was going to happen or could happen.

1 concept of foreseeability is one that has alternated in 

2 and out of this Court's cases, but let's take the case 

3 of Gallick in 1963, where a fetid pool with vermin and 

4 rats were allowed to live by the railroad's negligence, 

and it was believed that an insect was growing -- insect 

6 bodies were growing in that fetid pool, and as a result 

7 of that insect bite, the injured worker's legs had to be 

8 amputated by the effect of this insect bite. 

9  Now, many people would argue -- in fact, the 

lower court had concluded -- that it was not reasonably 

11 foreseeable that the railroad's negligence in allowing 

12 that stagnant pool to exist would nonetheless lead to 

13 the injury sustained by the worker. 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It might not be 

reasonably foreseeable that an amputation would occur, 

16 but it was reasonably foreseeable that some injury to 

17 people would happen as a result of these infected insect 

18 bites, no? That's what the court ultimately said. 

19  MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. But what 

the court had also done was to rely on earlier cases in 

21 which it's saying these concepts really are relaxed 

22 because the purpose of FELA is to provide a substitute, 

23 if you will, for workers' compensation, where if you can 

24 establish negligence on the part of the railroad and it 

causes, in part, the injury, the railroad will be liable

1 for that. 

2  And that's why this -- these concepts of 

3 proximate cause really are getting at a different 

4 problem, which is that when these statutes are enacted, 

you're trying to guard the defendant's liability against 

6 the entire world. And that's why it makes sense to 

7 impose some kind of restriction for foreseeability or 

8 for directness, because otherwise anybody could be 

9 liable to anybody else. Here, that problem is removed, 

because the railroad is the only -- can only be sued, 

11 under FELA, by the employee, and only if its negligence 

12 plays a role in producing that injury. 

13  If I could go back to the words that 

14 Mr. Rothfeld's trial counsel had proposed, the "probable 

sequence" word is now not even used anymore in Illinois. 

16 So it would be very odd to think that you would reverse 

17 an instruction here, where the proffered instruction by 

18 the railroad doesn't even State what -- the proximate 

19 cause instruction in the model language.

 Now the model language under Illinois calls 

21 for the natural and ordinary course of events. That's 

22 how proximate cause is now done under the Illinois 

23 proposed instructions. And it's hard to know how that 

24 language, Mr. Chief Justice, takes us any different from 

the common instruction that all juries are given, to use

3 means under these types of standards is the ordinary

apply their common sense without introducing the word

9  MR. FREDERICK: I think -- and I've never

11 would be to go back and try again based on the words 

12 that are there, because the whole idea behind these 

13 words was to try to end the debate between this Court 

14 and many State courts that simply didn't grasp that FELA 

was intended to provide a remedial statute with a 

16 causation element that was a weaker causation element 

17 than in normal negligence cases. And so this Court was 

18 taking dozens of cases under FELA between the 1930's and 

19 the 1950's in which the Court was looking at directed 

verdicts by State supreme courts that were overturning 

21 jury verdicts. And the whole idea behind making this 

22 the language of what constitutes a jury case was to 

23 remove the appellate review process from a lot of these 

24 things and to leave these questions up to the common 

sense of the jury.

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: You think that eliminates 

12 but-for cause, to tell them that negligence plays a 

13 part, no matter how small, in the injury? You think 

14 that eliminates but-for, rather than invites it?

 MR. FREDERICK: No, Justice Scalia, our 

16 position is that it is but-for plus a relaxed form of 

17 legal cause that's been well-recognized in the cases and 

18 hasn't produced a problem. Surely the burden is on the 

19 railroad to come up -- I would have thought that if they 

wanted to overturn the pattern instructions that have 

21 been used in nearly a half a million cases since Rogers 

22 was handed down, that they would have more than a case 

23 that they cite from one of their amici. I mean, they 

24 don't even cite the Richards case in their main briefs.

2 don't have any relation to the real world. 

3  JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the jury asks, Is it 

4 sufficient, is it necessary for the injury to be 

foreseeable? What does the trial judge say then? 

6  MR. FREDERICK: I think the trial judge 

7 says, No, it is not necessary for it to be foreseeable 

8 in a direct -- if the negligence plays a part, however 

9 small, in producing the injury.

 And that's why in cases like the Ferguson 

11 case, which was decided the same day as Rogers -- I 

12 mean, that's a very out-there set of facts, where the 

13 ship steward -- and remember, what you decide here also 

14 applies in the Jones Act for sea workers as well. But 

in that case, the Court said it was a jury question, 

16 whether the failure to provide an appropriate to 

17 implement to scoop hardened ice cream from the freezer 

18 on the ship was foreseeable, whether or not the ship's 

19 steward, in serving the ice cream, would reach for a 

butcher knife to try to chip away and lead to the 

21 severing of two of his fingers. 

22  I mean, we're talking about a dangerous 

23 situation, Justice Alito. At the time that FELA was 

24 enacted, in a year prior to that, some 12,000 people 

died and there were hundreds of thousands of injuries,

1 and the idea behind the statute was to provide a broad 

2 remedy so that rail workers could be compensated, not 

3 get extra damages like punitive damages, but just 

4 compensated for their injuries. And so the result is 

that railmen know they're going to have to go before 

6 juries exercising their common sense, and juries have, 

7 in many, many cases, ruled in favor of the railroads. 

8 And that system ought to be allowed to continue. 

9  If I could go back to one last point, and 

that is the idea of statutory stare decisis. We believe 

11 that because Rogers construed the "in whole or in part" 

12 language, it's entitled to statutory stare decisis where 

13 jury instructions have used that language. 

14  And at some level, this case is not too far 

from the Hylton case, which was decided in the early 

16 '90s, except the difference is in Hylton, the Court had 

17 dealt with a case from the early 1960s called Parden. 

18 And that case had had many of the underpinnings of -- of 

19 the question there that had been discredited or undercut 

by subsequent decisions. 

21  Here, there are no cases since Rogers that 

22 suggest doubt on the general validity of the Rogers 

23 rule. You have the cases that were decided in the 

24 immediate proximity of Rogers; you have Gallick in

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: We have three justices of 

2 this Court that say Rogers is irrelevant because it had 

3 to do only with multiple causes. 

4  MR. FREDERICK: And my answer to that, 

Justice Ginsburg, is that after Rogers, the Court 

6 applied the Rogers language to single cause cases. We 

7 have Webb, we have Ferguson, we have Kernan, we have 

8 Gallick, we have the statement in Crane that comparing 

9 the actions of the nonemployee, the -- the explanation 

for why the nonemployee has to go to common law is 

11 because there are these special features of FELA, one of 

12 which is no common law proximate cause and the 

13 elimination of contributory negligence and assumption of 

14 the risk.

 And then subsequently when the Court in 

16 Ayers and then in Gottshall says very clearly these are 

17 ways that FELA has departed from the common law and from 

18 the other statutes, in Gottshall the Court was very 

19 clear that it is relaxed causation and that this is one 

of the departures from normal common law standards. It 

21 would seem odd to hold now that all of a sudden we're 

22 going to talk about common law standards for causation 

23 where the Court over a series of decision over the last 

24 hundred years has knocked out six of the prevailing 

versions of proximate cause that were then in vogue.

part" in the statute. Result in part is not something 

21 that is more likely than not. For that reason, we

9  MR. ROTHFELD: No. The question is whether 

or not the kind of -- the risk of -- that there would be 

11 an injury follows from the -- the nature of the 

12 misconduct that gives rise to liability in the first 

13 place, and it is -- common law has always recognized

18  So -- so first, again I -- there is no
