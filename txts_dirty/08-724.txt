 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-724, Smith v. Spisak.

 General Cordray.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. RICHARD CORDRAY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. CORDRAY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 Because this case arises under the 

deferential standards of the AEDPA statute, Mr. Spisak 

must show that the Ohio Supreme Court's decision was 

contrary to Mills v. Maryland or that it unreasonably 

applied Strickland v. Washington.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why? I -- I have been 

trying to figure out why the State court would know in 

its decisionmaking that Mills commanded a different 

result when Mills was issued after the State denied its 

petition for rehearing.

 MR. CORDRAY: It's a bit of a conundrum, 

Your Honor, because Mills was issued after the Ohio 

Supreme Court's decision here, but before it became 

final on direct review when cert was denied by this 

Court in March of 1989.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, finality in that

sense is generally looked at in terms of AEDPA statute 

of limitations. Why should the same rule apply to the 

question of whether a State has acted contrary to or 

unreasonably in light of Supreme Court precedent when 

the precedent didn't exist at the time it was rendering 

its decision? How can a court act?

 MR. CORDRAY: I'm perfectly willing, Your 

Honor, to back it up a step and say Mills was not 

clearly-established law at the time that the Ohio 

Supreme Court decided, although the issues were current 

at the time.

 But I would go further and say the extension 

of Mills that the Sixth Circuit's ruling made here is 

not clearly-established law even today, more than 

20 years later. There is a -- the vast majority of 

Circuits, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Tenth, have 

rejected the position the Sixth Circuit took here, and 

in fact, this case is quite distinct from Mills even if 

Mills were applicable. But I would take your point and 

I would agree with it that it's kind of tough to impose 

on the Ohio Supreme Court Mills when -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We don't have to go any 

further if we simply address the question, at what point 

in time are we talking about a State court's decision, 

correct?

MR. CORDRAY: Fair enough. Fair enough. 

Yes. But I would say this case is distinct even from 

Mills, where the Court determined that the jury 

instructions gave the jury to believe that they could 

only consider mitigating factors that they had 

determined unanimously to be present. And in this case, 

none of that was done. The verdict form was quite 

different, and in fact the jury was only instructed to 

be unanimous on the ultimate question of whether the 

aggravators outweighed the mitigators, a common 

instruction and one that's upheld around the country 

consistently.

 Second -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Cordray, under 

the charge that was given, what happens if there is a 

juror who thinks that the aggravating circumstances 

don't outweigh the mitigating circumstances? Under 

Ohio's current instruction that means no death penalty.

 But under the instruction that was given 

here, that all 12 must agree on -- on the aggravators 

outweighing the mitigators, what is the consequence of a 

failure of the jurors to agree on that question?

 MR. CORDRAY: Even at the time, if the jury 

effectively hung -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

MR. CORDRAY: -- on that question, the 

consequence would be that the court would then impose 

some version of a life sentence.

 The issue is whether the jury was required 

to be instructed that at the time, whether they were 

required to be instructed something that might push them 

away from unanimity. This Court has never so held, and 

in fact, in Jones v. United States the Court rejected 

that rule in a ruling that was not dissented to by 

anyone on the panel. Your dissent in that case at 

footnote 20 took no issue with the -- with the notion 

that the jury did not have to be instructed in ways that 

would push them away from rendering unanimous verdict on 

the ultimate question.

 Since that time, as a matter of State court 

practice the Ohio Supreme Court in State v. Brooks did 

say: We are now going to add that instruction. But 

they later themselves rejected that that was required by 

the Eighth Amendment in State v. Davis, and that also 

has been the consistent holding of most circuits, that 

that is not required. If I could move -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be -- under the 

charge that was given in this case, you say it would be 

-- then the judge would be obliged to give one of the 

two life sentences. It would not be a deadlock

requiring a resentencing hearing.

 MR. CORDRAY: I believe that's the case at 

the time, Your Honor.

 At the time, the instructions pushed the 

jury toward unanimity one way or the other. Do the 

aggravators outweigh the mitigators or do they not? 

Since that time, the Ohio Supreme Court as a matter of 

practice has been willing to go further and instruct the 

jury, or have the jury be instructed, that if a single 

one of you feels that the aggravators do not outweigh 

the mitigators, that will preclude a death sentence.

 But that has never been constitutionally 

required by this Court. It is an extension of Mills v. 

Maryland that has never been so held by this Court, and 

in fact is a source of a -- of a significant 

overwhelming majority of circuits the opposite way.

 If I could move to the -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't your adversary's 

position -- I'm sure they will speak for themselves, but 

their position would be that this is a step further than 

Jones or other cases because if in fact -- what you are 

tilling us is that if the jury hangs, the court will 

have to impose a life sentence or some form of it.

 But the jury could believe that they could 

-- that it's either death or life, and one holdout juror

would say: Well, I don't want to let this guy out; 

because those are the only two choices and 11 people 

want to go for dead -- death and I'm the only holdout, I 

have to vote for death to make sure that he is 

restrained in a way that I find acceptable.

 MR. CORDRAY: This, as Your Honor notes from 

your time on the trial court, is the jury dynamic in the 

jury room. It is the push towards unanimity. The issue 

here is whether the Constitution requires an instruction 

to be given that would encourage a single juror to hold 

out and try to avoid reaching a unanimous verdict. The 

Court has never held that that is constitutionally 

required, and if they did so hold in this case it would 

be an extension that is a new rule and would not be 

applicable on AEDPA review here.

 Second, on the ineffectiveness claim, 

Mr. Spisak loses sight of the fact that this was no 

run-of-the-mill trial. His crimes were among the most 

infamous in Ohio history. At the trial he groomed 

himself to look like Adolf Hitler, and on the stand he 

celebrated his victims' deaths, spewed his racist 

beliefs, and pledged to continue his own brand of 

personal warfare against society. In the sentencing 

phase, defense counsel reasonably took the only tack 

available to him. He used the sheer depravity of his

client's crimes and his disturbing character to tell a 

story about his client's mental illness, and he asked 

the jury to forego the death penalty for Mr. Spisak 

because he is mentally ill and thus, under the 

mitigating factor, lacked substantial capacity to 

appreciate or conform his conduct to the requirements of 

the law.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Cordray -­

MR. CORDRAY: That is not sufficient -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- in reading that 

closing argument, it is disjointed. It goes off on 

tangents that have nothing to do with the sentence that 

the defendant is getting. I mean, it really is quite a 

stream of consciousness. And what's remarkable about it 

is at no point did counsel say, give him a life 

sentence. He said that either one would be acceptable, 

either death or life would be acceptable.

 MR. CORDRAY: First of all, I would disagree 

with that characterization of the closing. It was not a 

perfect closing, but it had three identifiable pieces to 

it. The first was, he -- he did go back and 

recapitulate the nature of the crimes, something this 

Court said in Yarborough is an acceptable defense 

strategy. That's the elephant in the room. The jury 

heard weeks of testimony about this crime. The

prosecutor was surely going to highlight that. He was 

attempting to take this sting out and identify with the 

jury that he understood how they would react to the 

crimes.

 The second piece of the closing -- this is 

at petition appendix, approximately 339a to 344a, he 

goes into the mitigating factor of mental illness. He 

had presented three mental health experts in the 

sentencing phase to demonstrate that his client was 

mentally ill. He had made a continued argument that 

there was a larger jar of not guilty by reason of 

insanity that he had not been able to fulfill, even 

though he had tried at trial, and that evidence had 

ultimately been struck by the trial court, which found 

they have not made out a defense of not guilty by reason 

of insanity.

 But he pursued the same theme here in 

sentencing, presenting evidence and saying: We have at 

least fulfilled the smaller jar of mental illness, 

diminished capacity to intend, and because we are a 

humane society our general assembly has made that a 

mitigating factor that you should apply here, and you 

should not execute someone who has a diminished ability 

to intend.

may I -- you are basically arguing that he was not -­

not deficient in performance.

 MR. CORDRAY: That's right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Assume I am persuaded that 

there was deficient performance, for all the reasons 

your adversary argues, and I am focusing on the 

prejudice issue. I think you make a very strong 

argument that this guy would have gotten the death 

penalty anyway. But what if -- what if the deficiency 

had been even worse? Supposing the defense counsel had 

got up and said: I wish I could make an argument, but I 

really think you ought to give him the death penalty -­

just outrageously sided with the prosecutor. Would that 

mean that we could still find no prejudice?

 MR. CORDRAY: I think in Cronic the Court 

said that if there is effectively a structural 

breakdown -- I mean, if in fact counsel had gotten up 

and argued solely a prosecution argument and not pivoted 

at all to mitigating circumstances, perhaps it would be 

possible to presume prejudice in that situation. That's 

not the situation in this case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I -- I understand 

that. But -- so you really are saying the question is 

whether Cronic or Strickland controls?

 MR. CORDRAY: That's one of the questions.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. CORDRAY: Although in our cert petition 

question 2, we also argue that the Sixth Circuit erred 

by not deferring to the Ohio Supreme Court's application 

of Strickland v. Washington.

 And on the prejudice issue, this is 

Landrigan. That is the case this Court decided and then 

granted, vacated and remanded this case back to the 

Sixth Circuit. If you look at the prejudice discussion 

in Landrigan -- and I would direct attention to the 

quote near the end where the Court says that the court 

of appeals panel got it right, and what they said was 

that the -- the testimony was chilling. The person in 

Landrigan had repeated -- had committed repeated murders 

and tried to kill again and again.

 The same with Spisak in this case. He had 

been unrepentant in the court and in fact had flaunted 

his menacing behavior, just as Spisak went on for days 

on the stand expressing his white power views and how he 

would continue to war if he had the opportunity, if 

given the chance.

 In Landrigan this Court approved the court 

of appeals statement in the end that any further, minor 

mitigating evidence that could have been presented in 

the wake of that record could not have been helpful;

there is no prejudice. That prejudice holding in 

Landrigan I believe controls this case. In fact, this 

case may be even a stronger case than Landrigan for no 

prejudice.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But does your argument 

really depend on any deference to the State Supreme 

Court? It seems to me that your argument is just sort 

of as a fresh matter there wasn't prejudice here. And 

-- and isn't it also true that we really don't know what 

the Ohio Supreme Court's basis for its decision was, 

whether not competent, incompetence, or lack of 

prejudice.

 MR. CORDRAY: I would say three things, Your 

Honor. First of all, I would agree with Yarborough, 

where this Court said that the -- the determination 

about deficiency and prejudice is doubly deferential 

through the AEDPA lens. We would defer, as Yarborough 

said, to reasonable tactical decisions made in closing 

argument, but we would be doubly deferential under AEDPA 

because we have to hold that the Ohio Supreme Court's 

rejection of the ineffectiveness claim was itself 

objectively an unreasonable application of Strickland. 

So that's one.

 Number two, the Ohio Supreme Court did 

reject this claim. It cited Strickland v. Washington.

It did not go on in detail.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But we don't know which 

prong of Strickland it relied on, do we?

 MR. CORDRAY: We don't. But this is not a 

case like Rompilla, where the -- where the Court was 

faced with a court that had held only on one prong and 

had disclaimed any attempt to review under the other 

prong. If the court simply gives a summary affirmance 

or summary disposition and doesn't specify which prong, 

I think the Court has to give deference under both 

prongs, because the alternative would be to give 

deference under neither prong, which is inconsistent 

with the -- the AEDPA statement that we have to did 

defer to an adjudication on the merits by a State court. 

And so I think that is -- that is fair here. But I 

certainly think -­

JUSTICE STEVENS: So you'd say a State 

supreme court is entitled to more deference if it 

doesn't tell us the basis for its decision?

 MR. CORDRAY: It -- it may seem a little 

odd, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. CORDRAY: If they disclaim a prong, then 

I think it's de novo review, and Rompilla did say that. 

If they don't disclaim a prong, I think that the Court

has to defer because the alternative is it gives no 

deference to summary dispositions, and -- and that has 

been the general tenor of courts under AEDPA, is if 

there is a question you err on the side of giving 

deference. That clearly was Congress's intent in 

enacting that statute.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there are two 

extremes. One is no defense whatsoever, Justice 

Stevens' hypothetical. The attorney just comes in and 

says, kill him, okay? And then there is another, which 

is your very eloquent explanation of this attorney's 

strategy. If he had done what you did here, we may not 

be having this appeal. But at some point you can have a 

strategy and execute it so poorly, so incompetently, 

that you're providing ineffective assistance of counsel. 

You are not accepting that that can occur, you are 

saying the minute an attorney says, I had a strategy, 

that that is effective counsel, regardless of how that 

attorney executed that strategy. That appears to be 

your argument.

 MR. CORDRAY: We, of course, Your Honor, 

don't have subjective testimony from the counsel as to 

what his strategy was. But I think it's quite apparent 

from the record. He at trial attempted to establish a 

defense of not guilty by reason of insanity. He was set

back, he and his trial team, because in the end the 

trial judge rejected that defense and struck that 

testimony. He renewed his effort at the sentencing 

phase by bringing several mental health experts and 

having them testify on the stand to show that at least 

they had met the lower standard of mental disease or 

defect under the Ohio Revised Code.

 He then argued, perhaps not as eloquently as 

-- as one might, you know, as -- as Justice Jackson once 

said, you know, in their bed that night, but he argued 

about: Yes, these crimes were brutal. He went on at 

some length about that. But these crimes were brutal 

and the jury had heard all that and clearly had that in 

their minds. He then pivoted to five pages of closing 

arguments, in addition to days of presentation on the 

subject, to say: We have shown at least mental illness; 

it is a mitigating factor; the General Assembly made it 

a mitigating factor and we as a humane people should be 

proud that we do not execute someone who has substantial 

deficiency in ability to intend.

 He then went on to handle some rebuttal 

points that he was -- he was feeling the heat on from 

the prosecutor's presentation. For example, that he had 

not necessarily met with these experts before they came 

and testified at trial; that he had perhaps shopped for

experts and other matters of that sort; that maybe the 

-- the jury was going to hold against him and his 

defense team their deficiency as counsel, because they 

had made this effort to get not a -- a not guilty by 

reason of insanity plea and the judge had knocked that 

out.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Have you ever heard or read 

a defense summation that was more derogatory of the 

defendant than the summation here?

 MR. CORDRAY: I have not read a great number 

of defense summations, but this was derogatory. But 

frankly, the bed that was made was made by his client, 

who got on the stand for days on end and spewed his 

racist propaganda, made it clear that he was not only 

unrepentant but was triumphant; that one or more of his 

murders were slick, pretty neat; that he celebrated the 

killings; that he went out to kill again, that if he had 

the opportunity now he would again go out to kill again.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But defense counsel -­

MR. CORDRAY: That's the context.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- goes so far as to say: 

Don't look to him for sympathy because he demands none. 

But isn't that exactly what he has to appeal for in 

order not to get a death verdict, sympathy based on -­

on mental illness, despite the horrific crimes that this

person committed and the things that he said on the 

stand.

 MR. CORDRAY: No, Your Honor. And I think 

again counsel in the context of this proceeding judged, 

perhaps rightly, that it was very unlikely this jury was 

going to have sympathy for his client. Instead he 

appealed to the jury's own sense of humanity and pride: 

We have this mitigating factor under the law, we are a 

civilized people, we do not execute people who have 

substantial diminished ability to intend; and I appeal 

to you, you jury, even though I can sense that you are 

not feeling sympathy for my client, do what -- what 

makes you a humane people, what makes us proud as a 

people, and do not give the death penalty to a person 

who is sick, demented, twisted, as my client has shown 

himself to be here on the stand.

 I think it's a coherent strategy. In fact, 

I don't see easily how he could have done better. And 

as in Landrigan, if he had said, give him sympathy, give 

him a life sentence, which was the thrust of the entire 

proceedings, I don't think that that created -- that 

lack of saying that created any prejudice on this

deficiency point, this Court said that focusing in on 

one particular theme may well be a preferable strategy, 

and there has to be broad deference given to closing, 

which is only a part, after all, of the entire 

sentencing proceeding, in that taking an understated 

approach that -- that emphasizes the jury's autonomy.

 In Yarborough, if you remember, the defense 

counsel did not actually ask specifically in so many 

words for a life sentence. The Court said that's not 

deficient. He could count on the judge's charge to the 

jury. They were going to charge the jury as to how to 

handle the evidence. It was the thrust of the whole 

proceedings. He presented three mental health experts 

to show mental illness and diminished ability to intend. 

And he argued that as part of his closing.

 I think it was not deficient, and I 

certainly think on this record, this stunning record 

created in part by his client's crimes, which were 

acknowledged and undisputed and there was no factual 

dispute about them and their heinousness, and then by 

his client's testimony on the stand, which graphically 

and at great length reinforced his, again, triumph in 

his -- in his warfare against trying to kill as many 

black people, Jewish people and gay people as he could 

find, and that he would continue that warfare if given

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. BENZA

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. BENZA: Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The Sixth Circuit evaluated performance of 

trial counsel in this case and found deficient 

performance for three primary areas.

 First, counsel presented and argued to the 

jury nonstatutory aggravating factors as reasons to 

impose the death sentence on Mr. Spisak. In Ohio, the 

jury is allowed to consider only the statutory 

aggravator factors, not nonstatutory factors. The 

counsel specifically identified and argued four reasons 

to execute Mr. Spisak.

 He then proceeded to tell the jury what was 

not mitigating evidence in this case, including factors

that have long been accepted as mitigating factors like 

performance in prison, adaptive skills and the issue 

regarding his family upbringing and childhood.

 Finally, the lawyer turned to what he argued 

was the only mitigating evidence that they were going to 

be arguing, and that was the issue of the client's 

mental health. He then -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say -- you fault 

him for not talking about performance in prison, 

prospective performance in prison?

 MR. BENZA: That is correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't look like 

that's going to be a very strong argument. I mean, he 

is still talking about people he wants to kill, and you 

are going to get up there and say he might perform well 

in prison?

 MR. BENZA: Absolutely, Your Honor. In 

fact, because it is directly related to the mental 

health evidence. Had the lawyer identified the 

testimony of the mental health experts, including 

Dr. Resnick, who is the court clinic psychiatrist, who 

testified that while he has been incarcerated and 

receiving treatment his performance and his mental 

illness has resided -- that he has gotten better. And 

that he is not -­

but that's what the experts testified to. And this was 

the court clinic expert who was testifying, who 

evaluated him for the not guilty by reason of insanity.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I guess it gets 

back to the -- the point, we are talking about what a 

jury would think and isn't it possible. You are 

suggesting, I think, he -- he should grasp any straws 

that are there, this might help. But isn't it possible 

that that would have a negative effect on the jury? In 

other words, they see this lawyer telling them this guy 

is going to do well in prison and the lawyer's 

credibility is -- is shot.

 MR. BENZA: If there is no evidence to 

support that, that would be correct. The problem that 

this case presents -- and this is what the Sixth Circuit 

found -- that had the lawyer then said, yes, for all of 

these reasons they may weigh in favor of death, but here 

are the reasons why you should consider life, we would 

have a very case than we have here today.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Benza, do you know of 

any case where ineffective assistance was found on the 

basis of a closing argument alone? General Cordray 

pointed out that this lawyer had put on a number of 

witnesses to testify to the defendant's mental illness, 

and that he did play that theme in the closing.

Do you know of any case where the closing, 

not tied to the way the case was presented at trial, was 

held sufficient to constitute ineffective assistance of 

counsel?

 MR. BENZA: No. And that's because this 

case is such an outlier. I have been litigating capital 

cases since 1993. I have never seen a closing argument 

like this.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What would you have done? 

I mean, I'm -- I'm not experienced in this. But I mean, 

I have heard the other side and I have read the 

argument. And it makes sense logically to say he has 

the worst defendant he has ever seen. He's murdered 

lots of people in cold blood. He gets up on the stand 

and says: I'm going to kill a lot more. He sounds 

totally bonkers. And -- and he says to the jury, I 

can't tell you that what he did was not aggravating; it 

was terrible. I can't tell you that there's anything 

here that should make you feel better about him; there 

is nothing. But we are a nation of people who are 

humane and our law says don't put a person to death when 

he fills with his nuttiness that third prong, which is a 

lower standard of insanity than I had to meet. But it's 

clearly met and here are the experts; I point to their 

testimony, and that's what they said. So be humane.

Now, you think he should have said something 

else. What?

 MR. BENZA: He -- what he should have done 

is what this Court recognized in Penry v. Lynaugh, is 

that mental health evidence is a double-edged sword. 

The job of the defense lawyer is to explain why the 

mental health evidence mitigates the crimes -­

JUSTICE BREYER: No, he -- he said why. He 

said. He said: We don't execute people who are crazy 

and this guy is crazy. He might not be crazy enough to 

meet the standard of not guilty by reason of insanity. 

He's not crazy enough to meet the standard of 

incompetency, but you just heard three experts tell you 

that he's seriously crazy. And if you don't -- if you 

doubt them, don't doubt your own eyes.

 I don't see -- how can I sit -- and we have 

courts, two courts who said, yeah, that was okay.

 MR. BENZA: Well, we actually don't know 

what the State court said about -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Or we had at least one 

State court that found it okay.

 MR. BENZA: For whatever reason we had the 

State court decision that affirmed this. We have no 

idea why.

decided that this was the mitigation strategy that he 

was going to present, this was the evidence that he had 

available to argue to him, it is the role of the defense 

counsel to advocate.

 So once the lawyer makes the strategic 

decision, I am going to present the closing argument 

focused -- based on mental health mitigating evidence, 

then the lawyer's job is to stand up and explain to

JUSTICE BREYER: But I agree with all that 

you are saying. What I am saying my hard time is here 

is why wasn't this advocacy, when indeed a reasonable 

decision as to what constituted advocacy in those really 

rare circumstances where it was the worst kind of 

defendant he had ever seen in his life who deserved no 

sympathy?

 MR. BENZA: As the amici points out, there 

is no strategic reason for this closing. The amici for 

Petitioner -- or for Respondent has identified that 

there can be no strategic reason to have provided this 

closing argument. By any evaluation of the skill of 

closing argument this was deficient.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think -- I think it 

was swallowing the worst evidence. It was telling the 

jury that was going to think this is a hateful person

who had done hateful things.

 I agree with you. I accept all of that, but 

even if you feel that way, I thought it was a brilliant 

closing argument. You said you've -- you've conducted 

many capital cases.

 Have you ever conducted a capital case in 

which the defendant takes the stand with a Hitler 

moustache and says he's glad for what he's done and he 

will do it again?

 How many cases have you had like that?

 MR. BENZA: No. Spisak is the only one like 

that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: This was an extraordinary 

trial, and it seems to me that the -- that the technique 

that -- that counsel used to try to get mercy for this 

fellow was -- was the best that could have been done.

 MR. BENZA: If that's your conclusion, then 

we -- we don't point on the merits of the claim. I beg 

to differ -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if -- if the 

strategy that Mr. Cordray and Justice Breyer and, to

Justice Sotomayor said, his argument was fine, and 

Justice Breyer -- but that is not the argument we have.

that you have -- the best case that you have, maybe a 

case in the courts of appeals or the state supreme 

courts, where it is said that the implementation of the 

strategy was just inept -- totally inept.

 I mean, is that what your argument is here?

 MR. BENZA: Yes, that the application, that 

the way the lawyer delivered the closing, the themes 

that he identified, the things that he said, was the 

deficiency -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Again, that depends on, 

oh, tone of voice, the ambiance of the courtroom. 

This -- this is very hard for us -- you know, he was 

trying to be folksy with the jury, obviously.

 These are things that are very difficult for 

us to assess.

argument -- and the only thing he didn't say that could 

have made this worse was Justice Stevens hypothetical of 

it's fine by me if you actually execute him.

 It's the only thing he didn't say in his 

closing that could have possibly made it worse for the 

client.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, he actually did 

say that.

 MR. BENZA: Not in those words.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but, pretty much, 

he said, no one's going to fault you if you impose the 

death sentence.

 MR. BENZA: And we will be proud of you, 

whichever you do. Only those very words, I would like 

you to execute him as well, did not escape his lips.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, I mean, it 

seems to me that you are imposing a strategic rule, and 

the counsel obviously made a decision -- or the record 

may reflect that the type of advocacy that you are 

telling us he has to have.

 Here's why you should give this guy 

sympathy. Here's why. Here's -- he's a good guy. I 

mean, there is -- even standing at that podium, there is 

a different strategy that people sometimes employ, which 

is sort of the understated -- you know, well, he did

some terrible things, don't -- I'm not asking for 

sympathy for these things, but -- you know, we are very

seems to me that this disagreement is over different 

styles of advocacy.

 And I don't know how to -- particularly in a 

case where you don't have much to work with, I don't 

know how to make a judgment that his choice was worse 

than the other.

 MR. BENZA: But that's what we do under 

Strickland. The court recognizes, in Strickland 

analysis, that there are multiple ways that various 

lawyers will try the same case; all of which can be 

effective.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You just told me that, 

under Strickland, under anything, there has been no case 

in which there has been a decision for the defendant, 

based on the inadequacy of the closing argument alone.

 So you are asking us to take a new tact and 

inviting arguments focused exclusively on the closing 

argument, to see if it meets the Strickland standard.

 MR. BENZA: Yes, but this court has already 

recognized that the Sixth Amendment applies, the right 

to counsel applies at closing argument.

right to effective assistance extends to closing 

argument.

 So this is not a redevelopment or an 

expansion of Strickland. It's simply an application of 

the Strickland analysis, the particular facts of this 

case before the -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- why isn't it the 

Strickland analysis that you read the charge in the 

context of the case that was presented at trial, and, 

here, the case was.

 The only thing going for the defendant were 

the witnesses to his mental illness and whether, 

eloquently or not, that theme was played to the jury.

 This is a mentally ill man.

 MR. BENZA: That's -- that's correct, and 

that's the theme that defense counsel said he was going 

to implement at the closing. What -- the failure of the 

lawyer was to adequately and effectively make that 

closing to the jury.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, he talked about 

nothing else. And I understand -- look, I am not an 

expert. I haven't argued these things to juries, and I 

recognize some lawyers tell me, okay, this was very 

rambling. I didn't think it was rambling.

I thought he was trying to spend a lot of 

time explaining away to the jury some prosecutorial 

remark, that you shouldn't pay attention to the expert 

because you, yourself, the lawyer, didn't talk to them 

enough.

 And so you describe that for a couple of 

pages and why it was irrelevant, and the reason he 

talked about the -- I thought, the reason he talked 

about the -- how you will feel when you go out of here, 

is because he recognizes this is the most sensational 

case in this community, ever, and all your neighbors are 

going to congratulate you.

 But what you are doing here is you are 

applying a standard, and you are proud to be an 

American, and that standard, as an American, is a humane 

standard that requires you to not give the death penalty 

when the man's insane.

 Now, I agree that he repeated that 7 or 8 or 

9 or 10 times, but it was the same point over and over. 

And how can I -- since there is a lower court that 

seemed to find this adequate, how can I sit here and say 

it wasn't?

question of whether or not the lower court found it 

adequate, we have no idea, again, what the Ohio Supreme

error raised to the Ohio Supreme Court. This is the

for prejudice.

 MR. BENZA: Well, because we don't know what 

the Supreme Court actually did.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: When we -- when you don't 

know what a lower court has done, the rule is you assume 

the best, not the worst. Isn't that the standard rule 

of review?

 MR. BENZA: That is.

it was a lawful basis.

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's the rule on direct 

appeal, of course, not on collateral.

 MR. BENZA: That is the rule on direct 

appeal. It is also the implication of applying AEDPA. 

The problem that you have in that is, when you try to 

apply AEDPA to this particular claim, you don't know how 

the state court, in fact, decided this case.

 And, therefore, you don't know whether or 

not you are going to give the AEDPA deference to the 

decision that there was no deficient performance, that 

there was no prejudice.

 JUSTICE BREYER: How -- how does that work? 

Certainly, it's a fairly common thing, that the 

defendant will make -- let's say, 20 arguments, maybe he 

would even number them.

 And it's fairly common to find a court of 

appeals in a state that says, as to argument number 17, 

and then they characterize it, we reject that argument.

 MR. BENZA: That is true.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that -- that happens 

all the time.

 MR. BENZA: That is correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And, now, it's very, very 

common that, in making that argument, there could be

some bad grounds for rejecting it.

 So would we send -- do we send every case 

like that back, to say, I want to know if you rejected 

it for a good reason or a bad reason?

 MR. BENZA: I would think, no, that you 

don't send it back, but what happens -­

JUSTICE BREYER: What we do is we assume 

they did it for a bad reason?

 MR. BENZA: I would -- I think the issue 

then would become that, when a state court chooses to 

summarily deny, without evaluation, an explanation of 

the merits of the claim, that, when it comes to habeas 

review, the constraints of AEDPA are lifted.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the Ohio Supreme 

Court, faced with 67 issues, would have to write at

 MR. BENZA: Not insulate from overturning, 

but to gain the benefit of 2254(d)'s restrictive reviews 

of habeas.

being overturned.

to our unreasonable application, it would be insulated

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any authority for 

that? Because, I mean, I'm not positive of this one, 

but I -- I do think hearing it that suddenly habeas 

opinions and district court opinions would grow by an 

order of magnitude, because it's very common to see 

arguments rejected summarily.

 MR. BENZA: That is correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, is there any authority 

for the proposition that if they reject it summarily, 

that then we don't assume they are right, but rather we 

assume they are wrong?

 MR. BENZA: No, this Court has never 

addressed how to apply 2254(d) to a summary decision. 

In Knowles v. Mirzayance, the Court noted that this was 

in fact an issue and reserved that for another day.

 In Early v. Packer, this Court recognized, 

though, however, that AEDPA constraints are looking at 

not just at the outcome of the lower court's -- the 

State court's decisions, but the reasoning behind it, 

because if you are going to have an unreasonable 

application of -- of a binding law from this court, the 

lower courts have to be able to apply it and explain, 

how did we apply it? Otherwise every decision of the 

State court would be insulated from Federal habeas 

review, making the writ available but unavailable.

Because no decision would therefore ever be unreasonable 

if the standard is for a district court judge to say: 

Can I imagine a reasonable way for the State court to 

have reached this result? I have; I'm a reasonable 

judge; the State court must have done what I have done; 

therefore, the review is limited, and the writ -- and 

the writ is denied.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you're -- if 

you're right about that issue on which we haven't had a 

decision yet, then we would look at prejudice on our 

own, without deference to the State court findings?

 MR. BENZA: It would review -- it would 

revert to pre-AEDPA habeas review to the standards, and

application in the -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that is not what AEDPA 

says. AEDPA says that we have to give deference unless 

it is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law. 

The burden is on the appealing defendant to show that it 

was an unreasonable application. In case of doubt, he 

loses.

 Now, AEDPA could have been written 

differently. It could have been written the way you 

want. The Supreme Court shall evaluate the 

reasonableness of the Supreme Court opinion. It isn't

Court law. And where there is a summary disposition,

application where we have no indication of how the State 

courts actually applied the law, it would have to be the 

extreme outlier that would demonstrate that that was an

given the deference that it is due, and that is that we 

simply cannot determine whether or not it properly 

applied Federal law, and therefore, it does not get the 

safe harbor of AEDPA evaluation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not how the -­

that's not how the statute reads.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why wouldn't you do 

that as well, then, even a fortiori, where I'm just an 

appeals court judge and I get a district court opinion? 

Most common thing in the world, summary judgment denied, 

motion denied, this denied, denied, denied. And if I'm 

going to start doing this for State cases, wouldn't I 

also have to do it for Federal cases whenever a Federal 

judge doesn't give all his reasons, which is the most 

common thing in the world?

 MR. BENZA: The Court does that when it 

reviews those quarters constrained by what actually 

happened in the lower court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: We did? I mean, I've 

reviewed thousands and thousands of them and I've always 

thought that a trial judge doesn't have to spell out all 

his reasons. And the question is really, given the 

circumstance, can we say that he acted contrary to law?

JUSTICE BREYER: If it's trial-based, you 

look at what the facts are that he might have taken.

 MR. BENZA: And that would be the evaluation 

that would continue on in habeas review of these claims, 

is evaluating the State court decision without, though, 

simply saying, well, we're going to -- and this is what 

happens in the lower courts. When you have these 

summary decisions in 2254(d) analysis, those circuits 

that have applied this say, what we will imagine a way 

in which the State court could have reasonably applied 

this law to reach this result, and therefore, since that 

is a reasonable way, because of course we as Article 3 

judges have reasonably come up with that, it must be 

reasonable, it's not an unreasonable application, and 

the writ is denied.

 The problem that we face is when you look at 

that in comparison to cases like Wiggins and Rompilla 

where the State courts affirmatively denied applying 

Federal standards, you get a different level of review. 

And so you end up encouraging State courts in these 

types of cases to simply issue postcard denials: Appeal 

denied. Federal courts, you figure it out.

that the State courts are -- what the Supreme Court of 

Ohio and all the other State supreme courts are doing is

protections of AEDPA. What that means for deferential

was an unreasonable application. It still falls to the

If you tell me we can't tell, you lose.

 MR. BENZA: That's the other alternative is 

that then the statute doesn't apply, which as this Court 

has recognized, when it comes to applying AEDPA, the 

side that is left untouched regarding that is the issue 

of the suspension of the writ.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So you are saying -- I 

mean, this is very helpful to me for a variety of 

reasons, but is -- in your view, the correct role of the 

habeas judge vis-à-vis the State judge there is the same 

as the Federal appellate judge vis-à-vis the district 

judge? That is, I'm thinking of a district judge makes 

a finding, doesn't fully explain it. Now, I would think 

it would be unlawful if it's an unreasonable application 

of a Supreme Court case. And I know how to review that. 

I mean, I -- I know how to review it, I think.

 Okay. So you are saying however I do that, 

I should do the same thing and the -- but you don't -­

you don't think there is a more relaxed standard than 

that? You think that's basically the standard?

 MR. BENZA: It's still the same standard.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Same -- but if they had 

made an explicit finding, then maybe it would be a 

tougher standard.

 The -- the question in front of the Sixth 

Circuit was whether or not the totality of the jury 

instructions in this case were such that they violated 

Mills' directive that an individual jurist's 

determination of a mitigating factor's existence could 

not be precluded from being considered by the injection 

of that -- of those factors by the other 11 jurors.

 What you have in this particular case is the 

totality of the jury instructions were such that a 

reasonable understanding of the instruction was that the 

jury had to be unanimous as to the understanding and the 

existence of a mitigating factor before it could even be

considered.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is your answer to 

the first question that Justice Sotomayor asked? Half 

of you say that -- that the State court's decision was 

contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of 

clearly-established Federal laws determined by the 

Supreme Court of the United States, i.e., Mills v. 

Maryland, when Mills v. Maryland hadn't been decided.

 MR. BENZA: In Terry Williams v. Taylor, 

this Court recognized in the opinion authored by Justice 

O'Connor that the issue for contrary to or unreasonable 

application is going to be governed by the 

application of Teague.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And are there -- are there 

not quite a few instances of contrary statements in our 

opinions?

 MR. BENZA: As to the application of Mills? 

Or -­

JUSTICE ALITO: As to the -- as to the time 

when the -- the law has to be clearly established by a 

decision in that court.

 MR. BENZA: No, this Court has maintained 

that the issue regarding the application of -- of 

controlling established -- what -- clearly established 

law by this Court is going to be determined by Teague,

and Teague determines that Mills v. Maryland decision 

applies to this claim. In -- it was adjudicated on the 

merits in State court.

 Now there is another -- underlying this is 

another AEDPA concern, is how does the Federal -- or the 

State court adjudicate the constitutional claim since 

Mills had not been presented. It decided the merits of 

the claim were -- were to be rejected but it did not 

decide the case under Mills v. Maryland because of 

course Mills had not been decided and we know from this 

Court's decision in the Banks case that Mills was a new 

law.

 JUSTICE ALITO: This Court has not said that 

clearly established Federal law refers to this Court's 

decision as of the time of the relevant State court 

decision.

 MR. BENZA: That this Court has said, but 

this Court has also said that the decision to that 

question is based on the decision of Teague. If a case 

applies to the Court based on Teague, then it will apply 

to the merits of this particular claim. And what the 

circuit found -­

MR. BENZA: This Court has held that the 

decision of whether a -- when a case is going to be 

clearly established for review in habeas is going to be 

based on Teague. That was the opinion by Justice 

O'Connor concurring in the judgment in Terry Williams, 

that the decision for clearly established is going to be 

based on the decision of the applicability of Teague.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does Teague say anything 

about time?

 MR. BENZA: Teague says that the decision 

for application of a newly established law or a new 

established constitutional rule is predicated on the 

denial of direct appeal, which in this case would be the 

cert denied by this Court of the direct appeal of the ­

case, which happened in 1989, a year after the decision 

in Mills was handed down.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the Mills 

opinion has one of those concluding paragraphs at the 

end that sort of sums everything up, and it says that we 

conclude there is a substantial probability that 

reasonable jurors upon receiving the judge's 

instructions in this case and in attempting to complete 

the verdict form as instructed may have thought they 

were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence 

unless all 12 jurors agreed on the existence of a

particular such circumstance.

 MR. BENZA: That is correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now how is that 

clearly established law that your claim is -- is 

contrary to Mills?

 MR. BENZA: Because in -- in our case every

that they had to be unanimous, including the specific 

instruction -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That is on death or 

nondeath, not on whether a particular mitigating 

circumstance exists.

 MR. BENZA: Actually they -- they were told 

that, because they were also told that that included 

their decisions as to all disputes of fact. The 

existence of a mitigating factor is of course a question 

of fact. So the jury was in fact specifically 

instructed to be unanimous to every decision that they 

made including resolving disputes of fact. They were 

told by both lawyers for the defense and lawyers for the 

prosecution that the first question they had to answer 

when they got into the jury room was to the existence of 

mitigating factors.

instruction was all 12 must agree that the aggravators 

outweigh the mitigators before death is imposed.

 MR. BENZA: That's correct, as to that

predicate question that the jury would have to answer 

and our position is that they also would have had to be 

unanimous per the instruction.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. CORDRAY: Thank you, Your Honor.

 On the Mills instruction, it -- it's clear, 

Mills was not decided at the time the Ohio Supreme Court 

rendered its decision. It was decided before this Court 

denied direct review.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that an argument 

you made before this Court?

 MR. CORDRAY: I beg your pardon.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this an argument 

that you've made before this Court in your brief, that 

we shouldn't consider whether Mills is the controlling 

standard because Mills came after?

 MR. CORDRAY: No. Nor am I making it now.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

 MR. CORDRAY: I am simply summarizing a 

response to Justice Sotomayor's question. But this 

Court -- on -- on Teague, in Beard v Banks determined 

that Mills itself expressed a new rule and expressed 

some doubt as to whether that rule itself was even clear 

until McKoy v. North Carolina was decided in 1990, which 

was to finality in this case. But the -- the jury 

instruction issue is entirely knocked out by the fact 

that this case is an extension of Mills that goes beyond 

anything this Court has ever held in the jury

instruction context. It is an extension of Mills that 

has been rejected by the majority of circuits to 

consider it, even today 20 years later, and it couldn't 

possibly be understood to be clearly established law.

 The reference to page 326a and the jury 

instructions, that's quite distinct from the passage 

where the jury was told specifically they have to be 

unanimous only on the ultimate question, whether 

aggravators outweigh mitigators. This was very 

different from the jury form in Mills which was itself 

was somewhat cryptic and -- and later was explained 

further in McKoy.

 If I could return then to the 

ineffectiveness issues. Counsel argued that there was 

deficiency on a couple of different grounds. First of 

all, that -- that defense counsel should have argued 

about family background and performance in prison. The 

family background was uncontested; it was humdrum; there 

was nothing special there. Performance in prison was an 

issue that was raised at trial. The prosecutor read to 

Spisak on the stand a letter he had written from prison. 

I am not going to foul the record with his specific 

verbiage but it was after a card game in which he had 

gotten into a fight with inmates and said he would like 

to kill them. When that was read to Spisak on the stand

his response was to say "Heil, Hitler" and give the Nazi 

salute to the jury.

 So the notion that we should be referring 

back to his performance in prison and that somehow would 

have helped mitigate the jury's consideration of the 

death sentence to me is -- is fanciful.

 In terms of the argument that defense 

counsel here argued, nonstatutory aggravators, that is a 

characterization that I don't think is accurate and it's 

not accurate as a matter of Ohio law. In our reply 

brief we cited State v. Hancock which indicates that the 

nature and circumstances of crimes are always relevant 

in determining whether the aggravators outweigh the 

mitigators, and in fact the main aggravator here was 

that Mr. Spisak engaged in a course of conduct that 

involved the purposeful killing of more than one person 

-- two or more persons, or the attempt to kill two or 

more persons which he had done here and which certainly 

was going to be and was, in fact, in fact if you read 

the prosecutor's closing, the heart and soul of the 

prosecutor's closing.

 As to whether the mental health presentation 

was, quote, "not strong enough," obviously it wasn't 

strong enough in the end to sway the jury. But you 

cannot judge by hindsight, this Court has said it again

and again, counsel's performance. The court said that 

in Strickland v. Washington itself, emphasized that 

tremendously in rejecting the deficiency claim in that 

case. And then in Yarborough as applied to closing 

arguments, the Court said very specifically we have to 

be doubly deferential to -- to strategic decisions made 

at closing, even if we might had made them differently 

or might have executed them somewhat differently, and 

particularly through the AEDPA lens.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what is your 

answer to your friend's explanation that it's hard to 

defer when they don't even say anything?

 MR. CORDRAY: I think that we have to read 

the statute. The statute -- the AEDPA statute, 2254 

says we defer to what? We defer to an adjudication by 

the State court on the merits. There is no suggestion 

here that this adjudication was on some procedural 

grounds or default grounds. It was a merits 

adjudication. It wasn't a lengthy, eloquent, you know, 

long explained adjudication, but it was an adjudication 

on the merits and deference should be given.

 The alternative is that if they don't 

explain which prong they are using that you defer to 

nothing, and that seems to be not consistent with what 

Congress clearly intended under AEDPA, nor is it

consistent with the language of the statute.

 The claim was made that the deference only 

applies when the State court, quote, "has done its job." 

Under the statute the job is to adjudicate a claim on 

the merits, not to provide a lengthy discourse in doing 

so. As to the prejudice point which I think is finally 

decisive and was the basis on which this Court GVR'd 

in -- in Landrigan, this is Landrigan -­

JUSTICE STEVENS: Can we just go back to 

that one point for a minute.

 MR. CORDRAY: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would your deference be 

exactly the same if, instead of listing all 47 claims or 

so, they simply entered a one-line order saying, 

"Affirmed"?

 MR. CORDRAY: I believe, Your Honor, under 

the statute, it would be the same, although here they 

did more than that -- you know, they cited Strickland. 

We have to assume they applied Strickland.

 And, as for the prejudice claim, we have 

findings from the Ohio Supreme Court that, I think, bear 

on the prejudice claim. In its decision -- this is 

309(a) through 311(a) of the appendix -­

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me -- let me go back 

to the question.

MR. CORDRAY: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think they are 

entitled to more deference because they did cite 

Strickland if they -- than if they did cite nothing?

 MR. CORDRAY: I think that the Ohio Supreme 

Court is entitled to deference because it adjudicated a 

claim on the merits, so -­

JUSTICE STEVENS: So it would be exactly the 

same deference whether they say it's Strickland or not.

 MR. CORDRAY: I would agree with that. 

However, if the Court was inclined to make gradation -­

this is a gradation beyond simply an unexplained order. 

Yes.

 As to prejudice, the Ohio Supreme Court at 

309(a) through 311(a) itself independently reweighed the 

aggravating factors against the mitigating factors, 

which is something the Ohio Supreme Court does under 

Ohio law.

 There had been some issues of merger of some 

of the aggravating circumstances. On direct appeal, 

they had dealt with those issues, and then they went 

back and reweighed, and they found that, on this record, 

the aggravating factors heavily -- lie heavily and 

beyond a reasonable doubt to outweigh the mitigating 

factors.

That is, in fact, the same kind of 

determination that the Court would make in trying to 

determine if there was prejudice here.

 As to the implementation of the strategy 

here, it is coherent in understanding what counsel was 

trying to do. Was it a bit rambling? Perhaps.

 You know, were there -- were there side 

issues that he tried to take up, which he thought went 

to his credibility with the jury and the credibility of 

the mental illness defense with the jury? Perhaps.

 But the strategy was twofold. It was to 

reference the crimes, make it clear to the jury he 

understood the nature -- the horrific nature of the 

crimes, as he thought the jury understood it, and then 

pivot to the mental illness -- mental disease or defect 

prong as the mitigator that the -- that the jury should 

apply in not giving the death penalty in this case.

 I think the strategy here was coherent. I'm 

not sure what else defense counsel could have done in 

this case, where his client had both committed these 

horrific crimes, undisputed, and then had reveled in 

them, in his flamboyant testimony from the stand.

 In the context of that and given the doubly 

deferential lens this Court has laid out in Yarborough, 

I think that there is neither deficiency, nor could
