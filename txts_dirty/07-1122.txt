 (10:02 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 07-1122, Arizona v. 

Johnson.

 Mr. Parkhurst.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH L. PARKHURST

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PARKHURST: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Petitioner asks that this Court apply the 

principles established in Pennsylvania v. Mimms to 

uphold the pat-down search of a vehicle passenger seized 

during a lawful traffic stop. Mimms established that a 

traffic stop satisfies Terry's first prong as to 

suspicion of criminal activity, and it also established 

that a pat down of a driver is justified if the officer 

has a reasonable suspicion that the driver is armed and 

dangerous.

 Fourth Amendment searches must be 

reasonable, and the pat down in this case was 

reasonable. And it is common -- it's a commonsense 

principle that the principles in Mimms also apply to 

passengers in the context of a traffic stop.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't hear your first

-- in your opening. Did you say that Mimms established 

that it's likely that he's armed and dangerous? I 

missed that.

 MR. PARKHURST: No, no. That's not what I'm 

saying --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm sure it wasn't, but I 

missed what you said on that point.

 MR. PARKHURST: What I said is that Mimms 

establishes that a pat down is justified in the context 

of a traffic stop if the officer believes that the 

driver is armed and dangerous.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you.

 MR. PARKHURST: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree that 

there's a point in an interaction that begins with a 

traffic stop, begins with a seizure, at which the nature 

of that interaction is changed so that it's no longer --

so that it becomes a consensual interaction?

 MR. PARKHURST: That -- yes, Chief Justice. 

That can happen in a traffic stop. There's no evidence 

in this particular case that there was any kind of 

evolution to a consensual encounter.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe I should 

rephrase the question. Do you agree that it would be 

unconstitutional for an officer to conduct a pat down

after an initial seizure while that same interaction 

still continues?

 MR. PARKHURST: No, I disagree with that, 

Your Honor. An officer can conduct a pat down any time 

it is reasonable in light of factors that the officer 

may notice about the individual. If the individual 

presents an immediate danger to the officer or to the 

public, a pat down may be reasonable under the broad 

Fourth Amendment principles, even if this happens to be 

a consensual encounter or a --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So in your view, or I 

suppose the government's view -- well, I'll let the 

government argue for itself. In your view, if the 

officer is just looking for the man in the gray overcoat 

and he stops someone on the street and says, have you 

seen a man with a gray overcoat, and the person says, 

well, I saw something like that, can he just suddenly 

spin him around and pat, and pat that person?

 MR. PARKHURST: If the officer possesses 

articulable facts that this person is immediately 

dangerous to that officer.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you're doing away 

with the first Terry factor altogether. Do you think 

all you need is reasonable suspicion that the person is 

armed and dangerous? What happened to the reasonable

suspicion that a crime has just been committed or is in 

the course of being committed?

 MR. PARKHURST: Well, the first prong of the 

Terry analysis, justice Ginsburg, is whether the 

officer's action is justified at its inception, and one 

way that it may be justified is if the officer possesses 

suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. But we also 

know from other case law that another way the officer's 

actions may be justified is during a traffic stop where 

there's no criminal activity.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, for a Terry --

for a Terry pat down you don't need, do you, articulable 

suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous? So 

long as you have a suspicion of unlawful activity, you 

can stop the individual and pat down. Do you have to 

have, in addition to stopping the individual, an 

articulable suspicion that he is armed and dangerous?

 MR. PARKHURST: I believe that's what Terry 

says, that you --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Both armed and dangerous?

 MR. PARKHURST: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, in your view if an 

officer was going down the street and he saw an 

individual as to whom he had no suspicion a crime was 

being committed, had been or was about to be, but he

said that guy looks like trouble for anybody who has 

anything to do with him, so he goes up to him and he 

says, I want to talk to you, and because he has 

reasonable suspicion that the individual looks like 

trouble, he pats him down. Is that a good pat down?

 MR. PARKHURST: Well, he would also have to 

possess articulable reasons that a prudently -- a 

reasonably prudent person would be satisfied with that 

this person is an immediate danger to him.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The individual gives him --

gives him mean looks and he has a bulge of something on 

his hip.

 MR. PARKHURST: Well, that could very well 

support a pat down.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you are doing away 

with the first Terry factor. There are two factors 

recognized: One, reasonable, articulable suspicion that 

a crime is afoot; and two, this person is reasonably 

suspected of being armed and dangerous. Your answer to 

Justice Souter suggests that you don't need the first 

one, you don't need to have any suspicion that a crime 

is afoot; it's enough that you reasonably suspect that 

the person is armed and dangerous.

 MR. PARKHURST: What I'm suggesting, Justice 

Ginsburg, is that the first prong of Terry is much

broader than just suspicion of criminal activity.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but in my hypothesis 

there was nothing that would satisfy the first prong of 

Terry. There is no lawful traffic stop, there is no 

indication that the individual has committed a crime or 

is about to or is doing so. So, so -- so Terry one is 

blank in my hypothesis, and you nonetheless conclude 

that as a result of dirty looks and the bulge of a 

probable gun on the hip, the officer can in effect 

initiate the action with the individual and pat him 

down.

 MR. PARKHURST: What I'm suggesting, Justice 

Souter, is that in the officer's community caretaking 

function the officer is authorized to approach an 

individual that he thinks is trouble, and in the course 

of asking neutral questions, if the officer believes 

that this person is immediately dangerous to the 

officer, then a pat-down would be appropriate in that 

instance. I'm not --

JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't the officer need --

justification for a stop, for a Fourth Amendment 

seizure, whether because of a traffic violation or 

because of suspicion of criminal activity; and then in 

addition to that, reasonably believe that the person is 

dangerous? I thought that would be -- I thought that

was your argument.

 MR. PARKHURST: Well --

JUSTICE ALITO: In the context of a traffic 

stop, you don't need, as to the passenger and the 

driver, you don't need suspicion of criminal activity. 

The person has been seized as a result of the stop, and 

then if you add on to that the reasonable suspicion of 

danger to the officer, that would be sufficient.

 MR. PARKHURST: What I'm saying, Justice 

Alito, is that in this particular case we certainly have 

a legitimate stop, and under Brendlin we also know that 

the passenger is seized during a reasonably routine 

traffic stop until the passenger is released. So what 

we have here is a presumption that the officer has the 

authority to control the passenger during the routine 

traffic stop, and we also have an instance in a traffic 

stop where an officer cannot avoid the individual, be it 

a driver or passenger. So in our case it seems like to 

the easy case where Mr. Johnson and Officer Trevizo were 

placed in close proximity, she detected things about him 

that she believed made him a threat to her, an immediate 

threat, and therefore all we're asking in our case is 

that she be -- she have the entitlement under the Fourth 

Amendment to pat him down.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Officer Trevizo

herself testified that she thought the seizure part was 

over. She asked him would he get out of the car, and 

then she said -- I think she used the word "consensual" 

herself, that it was a consensual encounter.

 MR. PARKHURST: Well --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That after the initial 

seizure was over, and then she wanted to question him 

about gang, his gang affiliations -- and didn't she 

testify? I seem to remember she did, and she said it 

was voluntary.

 MR. PARKHURST: She said that he could have 

refused to get out of the car. There's two things about 

that, Justice Ginsburg. One is we don't need to credit 

necessarily the officer's own subjective beliefs as to 

the -- whether the subject was free to leave or not. 

The second thing is, we know from Brendlin that unless 

the officer has given or the individual has asked for 

permission to leave, there's -- there is really no 

release. So Officer Trevizo was certainly entitled to 

enter a consensual conversation with Mr. Johnson during 

the lawful seizure, but there was no indication that he 

was free to leave. Moreover, even if he reasonably felt 

free to leave, it's irrelevant to whether he reasonably 

posed a danger to the officer.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess what you're saying

is that if there is a stop of the passenger and an 

interrogation of the passenger, the passenger can't say, 

incidentally, this is consensual, and thereby avoid a 

pat down?

 MR. PARKHURST: Correct, correct, and 

whether or not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me there 

is some indication that that's what happened here if you 

credit the police officer's testimony.

 MR. PARKHURST: Right. Certainly --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, you can 

have consent within the context of a stop that has not 

yet ceased.

 MR. PARKHURST: Correct. It would be 

analogous to, say, a, an inmate in a prison offering to 

give information to one of the prison guards. There's 

no question that the inmate is still in custody, even 

though the conversation itself is consensual.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask if your view of 

the law that, if the officer is pretty sure that the 

person he's having a consensual encounter with has a gun 

-- he could see the bulge or something -- is that 

sufficient or does he have to have some proof that the 

person is about to use the gun?

 MR. PARKHURST: It would be -- in the

context of a traffic stop because of all the unknowns 

that an officer must face, a bulge is usually sufficient 

to justify a pat down.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What about just meeting on 

-- on the street, the officer meets the man on the 

street and asks him where he's going or something like 

that, and he sees a -- a bulge in the pocket that 

convinces the officer he has a gun, but that's all. 

That's the only evidence of a threat to the officer. Is 

that enough?

 MR. PARKHURST: In that instance, it may be 

the prudent course to at least ask whether the person is 

armed. On a -- on a random --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What if he says "yes"?

 MR. PARKHURST: Well, then the officer could 

ask something along the lines of whether he has a permit 

to carry a gun. And whether or not the person has a 

permit to carry the gun or is lawfully in possession of 

the gun, it's a matter of basically the totality of the 

circumstances whether --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but I -- I thought 

you said that there has to be an articulable suspicion 

that he is armed and dangerous.

 MR. PARKHURST: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: A bulge would not be enough

to conduct a pat down after a Terry stop, therefore.

 MR. PARKHURST: That's exactly -- exactly 

what I'm --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then why should it be 

enough to -- to justify a pat down here?

 MR. PARKHURST: Well, because -- well, there 

was no bulge in this case. However, it's a matter of 

all the factors. It's a weighing of all the factors.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I understand. I weigh 

all the factors, and there's nothing but a bulge.

 MR. PARKHURST: Okay. Well, it's a matter 

of whether you believe that the person is dangerous.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So the bulge alone 

-- Well, whether I believe? There has to be, you know, 

a reasonable basis for --

MR. PARKHURST: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- an articulable basis for 

the belief, right?

 MR. PARKHURST: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So I don't see why a bulge 

alone would -- would satisfy.

 MR. PARKHURST: Well, in Mimms it was just a 

bulge in the -- the driver's jacket that justified the 

pat down. However, a person may possess a gun lawfully, 

and that person may or may not be a danger. For

instance, an off-duty police officer, they often carry 

their sidearms with them.

 They are not going to -- even if another 

officer knows that they're armed, they don't perceive 

them as a danger, and therefore no pat down is going to 

ensue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We have a whole separate 

line of cases apart from the Terry stop cases which 

allow officers to protect themselves by conducting a 

search of the surrounding area when they arrest 

somebody. And that justifies a pat down of the person 

that they arrest also, doesn't it?

 MR. PARKHURST: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Whether or not they think 

that -- that he's about to -- to draw the gun and shoot 

them.

 MR. PARKHURST: Correct. It's -- it's a 

matter --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't that line of 

cases be extendible to this kind of a situation?

 MR. PARKHURST: Well, it's a matter of 

during a traffic stop, Brendlin even says that officers 

must be able to exercise unquestioned command of the 

situation.

stop shouldn't they be able to ensure their own safety 

by -- by patting down the people who have been stopped, 

whether or not they have an articulable suspicion that 

they are about to draw and shoot? But that's not what 

you're proposing, is it?

 MR. PARKHURST: Well, what I'm proposing is 

the -- the standard Terry test. That --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. PARKHURST: -- the suspicion must be 

that they're armed and dangerous.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why go the Terry 

route instead of the route that -- that covers search of 

the area around the person who is arrested?

 MR. PARKHURST: Well, I believe that this --

the facts of this case fall pretty much under Terry. A 

-- a traffic stop will -- will impose circumstances that 

you're not going to get in a -- in a normal street 

encounter, because basically an officer -- we presume 

that an officer has the authority to control any of the 

occupants of a car. And "control" means not just 

ordering them out as in Mimms and Wilson, but also 

making sure that one of the occupants doesn't get behind 

you while you're dealing with the traffic investigation. 

It's -- it's --

end? You just said -- you said when the car is stopped 

everyone is seized, the driver and the passengers as 

well. The seizure ends at some point. Is that when the 

driver is ticketed and the police cruise off or --

MR. PARKHURST: That's the normal situation, 

and usually that's the analysis that bears on whether 

the driver has given valid consent to a search of the 

automobile or something like that. We -- we must bear 

in mind that a pat-down search is not an evidence 

search. This is not a full search. It's just a search 

of the outer clothing for an immediately accessible 

weapon.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: General Parkhurst --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how did the -- how 

did the officer come up with the marijuana as well as 

the gun?

 MR. PARKHURST: Well, because once he was 

arrested for the gun, then they did a search incident to 

arrest.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: General Parkhurst, I -- I 

seem to be a little confused about the facts of this 

case. I had the -- remember the testimony that she 

thought the -- that the encounter had become consensual, 

which meant that he was no longer -- in her view, no 

longer under police custody. But are you also saying

she also thought he was about to assault her; and, 

therefore, she was in danger?

 MR. PARKHURST: She did not --

JUSTICE STEVENS: There is a substantial 

difference between being both in danger and saying, 

well, the arrest was all over.

 MR. PARKHURST: No, she -- she did. She 

believed that he posed an immediate danger to her based 

on the numerous factors that she cited in her testimony. 

So she was -- she was afraid. She was afraid from the 

outset, as a matter of fact, because of the way that he 

made eye contact with the officers.

 However, we don't want our officers to avoid 

their law-enforcement functions just because they're in 

contact with a possibly dangerous person.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why had this 

descended from a -- a seizure to a post-seizure 

consensual encounter? Why was the seizure over?

 MR. PARKHURST: Well, we're arguing that the 

seizure was not over.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it seems to me you're 

-- you're acknowledging that she said that it was a 

purely -- you're not arguing it as based on a purely 

consensual encounter? I thought that that's what you --

suggesting that the seizure had never ended in this 

case. The Arizona court of appeals --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though she said so?

 MR. PARKHURST: Correct, because we don't 

have to necessarily take her word for that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The white light is on. I 

don't want to -- but your opening argument that you 

presented indicated that a seizure is not necessary. 

You -- you wanted a further rule.

 MR. PARKHURST: I -- well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the officer believes 

that a person is armed and might be dangerous, then they 

can pat down. That's -- that's the rule that you 

proposed, I thought.

 MR. PARKHURST: We believe that that is 

true. That's not the rule that necessarily arises from 

the facts of this case, because we believe that there is 

a seizure throughout the entire encounter, and that 

there is really -- there is no question that, as a 

seized passenger, Officer Trevizo could pat him down.

 And unless the Court has any other 

questions, I would like to reserve the rest of my time.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Heytens.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The decision in this case should be reversed 

for one of two independent reasons. First, at the time 

that Officer Trevizo performed this frisk, the Arizona 

Court of Appeals erred when it held that the seizure 

that had been caused by the initial traffic stop was 

already over. This seizure was still ongoing at the 

time of the frisk.

 Second, regardless of the answer to that 

question, under this Court's decisions in Mimms and 

Wilson it is constitutionally reasonable for a police 

officer to order any occupant out of a vehicle during a 

lawful traffic stop and to frisk that individual if the 

officer has a reasonable suspicion that that individual 

is armed and presently dangerous to the officer. In 

this case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree that 

there is a point at which the encounter initiated by the

traffic stop changes in some way that a pat down is no 

longer justified?

 MR. HEYTENS: We certainly agree, Mr. Chief 

Justice, that at some point the encounter is over, and 

that if it is in fact not over, the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if the 

encounter is -- by "the encounter is over," do you mean 

that they separate; they're no longer together? My 

question is whether or not it's a continuing encounter 

but transforms somehow in its quality so that the pat 

down is no longer justified.

 MR. HEYTENS: We agree that at some point a 

seizure can morph into a consensual encounter. We don't 

have any dispute with that. We would say that the 

fundamental reality of this situation is what the Court 

recognized in Brendlin, which is that at the time the 

car pulls over a reasonable person would understand 

himself to not be free to leave unless and until the 

police officer says something that makes fairly clear 

that the seizure is over and he's free to go.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose there is 

an argument, anyway, that even though the initial 

seizure is over, the consensual encounter continues. 

And at some point the officer, as a result of whatever 

happens during that consensual exchange, becomes

concerned for her safety.

 MR. HEYTENS: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and that's our second argument, which is at the end of 

the day we don't think it matters whether he's seized. 

Because whether he's seized or not, this is still a 

roadside encounter with a person who was a passenger in 

a vehicle that was --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you, suppose 

it's a roadside encounter in which the driver is 

changing a flat tire and the officer stops and wants to 

talk to him for a while and then he suddenly thinks, 

well, maybe this guy's armed. Is it okay for him to go 

ahead and search him?

 MR. HEYTENS: Well, I guess the first thing 

I want to say, Justice Stevens, is that it's not okay to 

think, maybe he might be armed. The officer has to have 

articulable suspicion.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, Maybe he has an 

articulable suspicion.

 MR. HEYTENS: Okay. Under those 

circumstances we think absolutely, and we think your 

hypo --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that any different from 

meeting somebody on the -- on the street corner?

 MR. HEYTENS: It is different in the sense

that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The flat -- my flat tire 

example.

 MR. HEYTENS: It is different because it's a 

roadside encounter, and this Court has recognized again 

and again and again --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But those are roadside 

encounters after a traffic violation.

 MR. HEYTENS: I -- I agree with you, Justice 

Stevens, which is why at the end of the day we don't --

we think that the officer, in basically those facts, 

should be able to perform a frisk on the street as well. 

I guess just -- again to say, I don't think the Court 

needs to reach that issue, because I --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't rely at all on 

the fact this is a traffic stop?

 MR. HEYTENS: We do rely on the fact --

JUSTICE STEVENS: On your second point, that 

is.

 MR. HEYTENS: We think this case is 

substantially easier because it's a traffic stop, 

because --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Why is it easier?

 MR. PARKHURST: Because this Court has 

recognized again and -- let me give you the example of

Wilson. Wilson is the case where the Court holds that 

it is per se reasonable for an officer to order a 

passenger to get out of the car.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but those are all 

cases in which there is a violation of law that preceded 

the activity. I asked you about cases in which there is 

nothing other than the officer's interest in patting 

down the guy because he thinks he has a gun.

 MR. HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, I think 

Wilson is highly significant in this regard, because the 

Court went out of its way in Wilson to point out that 

there's no reason to suspect a passenger with any 

illegal activity at all. The Court said you could 

distinguish Mimms on the ground that with regards to the 

driver you have suspicion that he's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, I disagree with that. 

The holding there was that the passenger was stopped, 

the passenger was seized, so this was a pat down in the 

context of an ongoing seizure.

 MR. HEYTENS: Justice Kennedy, I guess I 

would say we disagree with this. The Court didn't hold 

until Brendlin that a passenger is seized by virtue of 

the initial traffic stop. The Court went out of its way 

in Brendlin to say that none of its previous decisions 

had answered the question of whether the passenger is

seized by virtue of the original traffic stop. And the 

Court didn't even identify --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, even if that's true, 

why don't we accept Mimms with the gloss of Brendlin?

 MR. HEYTENS: We think that Brendlin is of 

course absolutely correct, and we think the passenger 

was seized, and we think fundamentally that's why this 

case is fairly easy.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you say -- your brief 

goes much, much further. And I'm looking at page 9 

where you say: "Police have to be able to protect the 

officer's safety from a person reasonably believed to be 

armed and dangerous whenever the officer encounters that 

person in a place where the officer has a lawful right 

to be."

 I read that to mean if the law -- the 

officer is on the street, in a pub, any place where he 

has a lawful right to be, that officer can, on the basis 

of a suspicion of armed and dangerous, pat down, and you 

don't need the first Terry. It's only -- it's only the 

armed and dangerous.

 MR. HEYTENS: Justice Ginsburg, we agree 

that that is ultimately the correct Fourth Amendment 

rule. But what we're saying is that the Court doesn't 

need to decide whether it agrees with us on this

point -- that point, excuse me, to resolve this case, 

because there are two very important distinctions 

between this case and that one.

 The first one is that we know that Mr. 

Johnson was seized. This was not a consensual 

encounter. We know under this Court's holding in 

Brendlin that there was a seizure of Mr. Johnson in this 

case. And the question is whether anything happened in 

this case to unseize him; and we think that the answer 

to that question is clearly no.

 And then the second reason is this Court has 

recognized over and over again that traffic stops pose 

unique heightened dangers to police officers, and so 

regardless of what the rule is outside the traffic 

stop --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you'd apply the same 

rule if the -- if the officer just stopped to help the 

guy change his tire.

 MR. HEYTENS: We do think that at the end of 

the day, Justice Stevens, the overriding command of the 

Fourth Amendment is that a police officer's conduct must 

be judged by a reasonableness standard, and we think 

that overriding command allows police officers to take 

limited and appropriate steps to protect their own 

safety.

JUSTICE SOUTER: But I take it, if I 

understood your earlier answer, you would extend the 

application of the rule as you understand it to the 

encounter simply on the sidewalk by a police officer who 

has no suspicion that the individual he wants to talk to 

has been, is or is about to commit a crime, but if the 

officer chooses to initiate the conversation, he then, 

in effect, if he can articulate any suspicion, like 

we'll say the dirty look and the bulge on the side, he 

can go ahead and pat down. Is that -- is that your 

view?

 MR. HEYTENS: At the end of the day, Justice 

Souter, that is our view. I think that case is harder 

than this case, and let me explain why.

 It seems like the argument on the other side 

is predicated expressly on the notion that unless a 

police officer has suspicion of crime, he can just avoid 

dangerous people, like any of the rest of us can choose 

to avoid them.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you if the 

Department of Justice has ever taken this position 

before?

 MR. HEYTENS: I'm not aware of whether we 

have had to take this position before, Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm asking you whether you

have. You don't think they have, do you? It's a rather 

extreme position.

 MR. HEYTENS: I'm not aware of whether we 

have taken this position or not in any previous case, 

because I'm not aware of any case that raises the issue 

that's raised by the going up to someone on the street 

hypothetical.

 We have certainly consistently taken the 

position that in the context of traffic stops it is 

constitutionally reasonable for police officers to 

perform Terry frisks whenever they have reason to 

believe that their safety is in danger. As I was saying 

to Justice Ginsburg, I think -- excuse me, Justice 

Souter, I believe -- I think the problem in the 

hypothetical where the officer goes up to someone on the 

street, it's predicated under the assumption that the 

police officer, like you and me, should just avoid 

dangerous people.

 We think that's fundamentally wrong about 

what the nature of a police officer's job is.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there's something 

fundamentally wrong probably about that, but the --

the -- I think the problem that sort of drives the 

questioning is that if you extend the rule as far as you 

want to extend it, we have to take into consideration

that the standard of articulable suspicion is the 

standard that, in practical terms, can pretty well 

always be met.

 You can -- you know Benjamin Franklin's 

remark, it's great to be a reasonable person because you 

can think of a reason for anything you do. And that's 

what's driving, at least driving my questions.

 MR. HEYTENS: Well, I certainly would add, 

Justice Souter, that it has to be a reasonable person. 

It's not that a police officer can recite some reason. 

It's whether a reason that a reasonable person in that 

position would find reasonable.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but what the officer 

cites is going to be a matter of fact, and the facts at 

that point are gone, they're in the past. And all 

you've got is the officer saying, you know, this is --

this is what I perceived. And maybe you've got the a --

defendant somewhere saying, oh, no, it wasn't like that. 

But in a -- in a situation like that, if articulable 

suspicion, in effect, can justify a sidewalk pat down 

without any articulation of a basis to think crime is 

afoot, then you've got a -- you've got a pretty wide 

open standard in the real world.

 MR. HEYTENS: Well, I guess, Justice Souter, 

to the extent you're concerned about that, I would say

the same thing is true about whether you have 

articulable suspicion of criminal activity, and the 

Court has decided that that risk is worth, you know, 

dealing with under the context of that question. So I 

don't really understand why in principle articulable 

suspicion of armed and dangerousness is any different.

 I would also say that in this case, 

regardless of whether there will be hard cases, the 

decision that this Court is reviewing is expressly 

predicated on the view that Officer Trevizo had 

reasonable suspicion Mr. Johnson was armed and 

dangerous. That's on pages 13 and 14 of the petition 

appendix.

 It is also the predicate of the question on 

which this Court grants review. The question which this 

Court granted review presupposes that she had a 

reasonable suspicion.

principal argument is that Terry should be revisited and 

that the two tests that Terry prescribed for a pat-down 

search, that there be reasonable suspicion that crime is 

afoot and reasonable suspicion of armed and dangerous, 

should be revised so that all that is required for a 

pat-down search is the second Terry standard.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- we've 

been talking about the officer approaching somebody on 

the street who has the bulge in his pocket, what if the 

person with the bulge in his pocket approaches the 

officer? Can the officer at that point, even if he has 

no suspicion that crime is afoot, conduct a pat down?

 MR. PINCUS: No, I don't think so, Your 

Honor. I think that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is -- this is 

like the rule in the Old West that the sheriff has to 

wait for the defendant to draw first?

 MR. PINCUS: No, I think the officer can --

it's -- I think it's important to make clear that the 

sliver of cases we're dealing with here are cases where 

there is a reasonable suspicion of armed and 

dangerousness but not a reasonable suspicion that 

crime -- criminal activity is afoot.

MR. PINCUS: If there really is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One moment. In 

response to my hypothetical, even though the officer 

reasonably thinks he is in a situation where he could be 

shot, he can't do anything about it, not even a simple 

pat down, even though he did not initiate the contact, 

somebody comes up to him?

 MR. PINCUS: If he reasonably believes he 

could be shot, Your Honor, then probably there is 

reasonable suspicion of criminal -- that criminal 

activity may be afoot because he'll have --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, let's just 

say it's like this case: The guy's coming up, he's 

wearing the colors of the Crips gang and he has a bulge 

in his pocket. It's not a crime to wear that type of 

clothing; it may not be a crime to have a bulge in your 

pocket; but he nonetheless has a reasonable suspicion 

that he's being -- he's in a threatening situation, even 

though he has no basis for thinking that a crime is 

being committed.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I think this 

goes a little bit to Justice Souter's comment in the 

first part of the argument. These two standards are --

are somewhat -- are mutually reinforcing, as we discuss 

in our brief. And if, indeed, as here, the State is

only arguing armed and dangerousness, and not arguing 

that criminal activity is afoot, it's clearly putting 

itself at the low end of the armed and dangerous.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not -- Mr. 

Parkhurst said in his opening that the traffic stop is 

the equivalent of the articulable suspicion that a crime 

is the equivalent of the articulable suspicion that a 

crime is afoot. It justifies this stop, and then you 

have to have something further to justify the pat down, 

but the car, the seizure of the car and its passengers, 

that is the equivalent of the first Terry. And why 

isn't that so? It's a stop; it's a legitimate stop.

 MR. PINCUS: I think that you're right, 

Justice Ginsburg, that's the second argument that they 

make, and our answer to that argument is that we don't 

think that Mr. Johnson was seized at the time the pat 

down occurred, as the court of appeals here found. The 

other side seems to ignore the fact that there is an 

actual determination by the court of appeals, looking at 

the facts of the situation, that there wasn't a seizure. 

And so--

JUSTICE SOUTER: Can we pursue that for a 

minute. What -- I guess -- we -- we all start with the 

common assumption that -- that there was at least a 

legitimate stop to start with.

MR. PINCUS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And my -- my question which 

-- which goes to who was right about whether the 

seizure, the legitimate seizure had stopped and the 

consensual encounter had begun, my question is what is 

it beyond the conclusory statement of the officer that 

in effect justifies drawing that conclusion that the 

stop was over?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, a couple of things, Your 

Honor. First of all, the Court has never discussed, but 

in Wilson it actually reserved the question, of what is 

the duration of the seizure of a passenger.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do we have -- do we have 

any evidence about duration here?

 MR. PINCUS: We don't have any duration, but 

the question -- I think an important question is does 

the seizure of the passenger necessarily in all cases 

coextend with the seizure of the driver? This stop was 

in an urban area. It might be one thing if it's a stop 

on a highway where there's really no place for the 

passenger to go. This was a stop in a -- and where 

there are concerns about the safety of a passenger who 

is allowed to wander off and the potential liability of 

the police. Here the stop was in an urban area, and --

and if the Brendlin says that initially clearly the

passenger was seized, the question is how long does that 

-- that seizure last?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If in my -- my problem in 

this case, I guess, in taking your position is, I don't 

think we have got an evidentiary basis to conclude that 

what we start by assuming is a legitimate stop has in 

fact run its course. I don't see how we can draw that 

conclusion. That's what I'm getting at.

 MR. PINCUS: Let me pick up some of the 

factors we rely on, Your Honor. First, just as a legal 

matter, the Court has said in Caballes and other cases 

that the scope of a Fourth Amendment intrusion turns on 

the purpose. Here we say the scope of the seizure of 

the passenger should turn on the ability to secure the 

scene. If the passenger is not involved in what -- in 

the facts that gave rise to the stop -- if it's clear, 

for example, quickly that the passenger doesn't own the 

vehicle, the reasons that -- the driver owns the 

vehicle, the stop, the basis for the stop relates to the 

passenger -- we don't see what the basis is for, in an 

urban setting at least, for any further seizure of the 

passenger.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then, in other words, 

you -- you are -- I -- I'll be candid with you. I would 

have started with the assumption, based on Brendlin,

that if the stop of the car and its driver also effects 

a stop and a seizure of the passenger, that you start 

out with the assumption that the seizure of the 

passenger is going to last for the same duration as the 

seizure of the car and the driver unless you have a good 

reason to draw some line and say, no, it doesn't. And I 

take it that you are not making that initial assumption; 

am I correct in that?

 MR. PINCUS: We're not relying entirely on 

-- on what I just said. But --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I think you're rejecting 

it, aren't you?

 MR. PINCUS: No, we're not relying -- we're 

rejecting that assumption. We don't rest entirely on 

the notion that the -- that the seizure of the 

passengers as a matter of law has to end. We think 

there are special facts here that show that -- that 

support the idea that the seizure was over. But I think 

one of them --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What are those -- what are 

those special facts?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, basically there was this 

interaction separate from the interaction with the 

driver to the extent the passenger -- Brendlin says the 

passenger, one of the reasons the passenger would feel

relationship to the driver and to the stop here. This 

interaction proceeded separately.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Are you saying -- are you 

saying if there are a driver and a passenger and two 

police officers, and one police officer is dealing with 

the driver, saying, you know, where's your insurance 

papers and so on, and at the same time the other officer 

is questioning the -- the passenger -- are you saying 

that that independent questioning of the passenger in 

effect eliminates the -- the passenger's seizure as --

as following from the seizure of the driver?

 MR. PINCUS: I think it's -- I think it's 

part, as the lower court found here, it's part -- it's a 

relevant circumstance. This is a totality of the 

circumstance test. The court of appeals here looked at 

that as one fact, looked at the officer's subjective 

intention --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I don't get it. Why 

should the fact that an officer, a separate officer is 

talking to the passenger, ultimately have anything to do 

with the duration of the passenger's seizure, absent a 

situation in which officer two says, "by the way, you're 

totally free to go"? We don't have that kind of strange 

situation. But short of a strange situation like that,

why does the conversation with the passenger have 

anything much to do, have any bearing on the -- on the 

length of the passenger's seizure?

 MR. PINCUS: To the extent -- I think the 

question here is what's -- one question is what's 

communicated to the passenger.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. PINCUS: If the officer had said in 

turn, would you mind stepping out of the car so I can 

ask you some questions unrelated to the stop about your 

hometown, it seems to us that that statement by the 

officer would provide some pretty strong indication that 

the seizure was over and that this was a separate 

investigation, having nothing to do with the seizure.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But we accept as hornbook 

law when they are -- when the police are questioning one 

individual whom they stopped, let's say for a traffic 

violation, that during that period of seizure, the 

reasonable period of seizure, the officer can ask 

questions about other subjects, and that doesn't end the 

seizure.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, the Court has said that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Like the -- passenger.

 MR. PINCUS: The Court has said that the 

officer can ask those questions, but the Court hasn't

said what the impact of that is on the seizure. And 

Here the officer certainly believed that her conduct and 

her words and her conversation, which we don't know how 

long it lasted or if there were a number of questions, 

communicated to the -- to the individual, to Mr. 

Johnson, the idea that this was a consensual encounter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't want to -- I don't 

want to take up your whole argument on this hobbyhorse 

of mine, but I mean my -- my only problem is, I don't 

see that we have got an evidentiary basis here to say 

that because of the duration or the mere fact of the 

questioning, there is a reason to say that as to the 

passenger, a reasonable passenger could say I am no 

longer seized, and -- and this encounter is totally 

consensual.

 The -- the officer testified, no question 

about it, but the test is subjective.

 MR. PINCUS: It is subjective. And I guess 

I would also point, Your Honor, to the Court's decision 

in Drayton, which dealt with the question in a somewhat 

different context, at a bus search, and whether or not 

passengers on a bus would feel that they were seized 

when there were officers in the front of the bus and 

they were asking questions. And to us, although this is 

obviously the converse, a lot of the analysis in

Drayton, which showed that -- which concluded that there 

wasn't a seizure there, because of the -- because people 

ultimately would feel free to come and go, given the 

nature of the interaction --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then don't you lose 

under that line of cases? This is the picture that the 

officer was painting, or I thought was, to bring this 

within the "Mind if I search your luggage" category of 

cases.

 MR. PINCUS: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- she's got consent. 

She doesn't have to -- she says, he said okay, he would 

get out and talk to me; he said okay when I began to pat 

him down; it's only in the middle of it he began to 

wriggle a little bit.

 MR. PINCUS: I think it's quite clear, 

Justice Ginsburg, that there's no question here that --

that there was a consent to the pat down. I think the 

lower courts have concluded and the other side hasn't 

sought review that there was no consent to the pat down 

here.

 I think the reason that Drayton is -- is 

relevant is that that's a case where the question for 

the Court was would these people feel free to terminate 

the encounter; and the Court concluded yes, they would.

And we think, given the different 

situation of the passenger, it's true that -- that 

Brendlin found the passenger seized. To some extent 

that was to give the passenger a shield, not to be used 

as the sword for further interrogation of the passenger. 

It recognized the reality that at the outset surely the 

passenger is seized.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're giving up a 

shield here, I take it? If instead of a pat down, the 

officer said, where were you last night at 10:00 

o'clock, without Miranda warnings, you would say, well 

that's just -- that's just fine?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, you know, Berkemer says, 

in the context even of a traffic seizure, Miranda 

warnings aren't necessarily necessary. But what we are 

saying is that, given the different basis for the 

seizure here, it's that initial conclusion that at the 

outset, yes, but that person, unlike the -- unlike the 

driver, who is the target of the police activity and 

therefore a reasonable conclusion for the driver is he's 

seized until the end of that activity, the passenger is 

not the target of the traffic stop.

show that a reasonable person in the passenger's 

position would have believed himself free to terminate

the encounter?

 MR. PINCUS: I'm sorry, Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: What are the facts that 

show that the person who was searched, which is Mr. 

Johnson -- is that right?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what are the facts 

that suggest that he thought he was free to terminate 

that encounter with the police?

 MR. PINCUS: That the -- that the 

interaction with the officer had nothing to do with the 

subject of the stop.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. I would say 

we've held a lot that that's just beside the point. If 

you stop a car for a traffic stop, you can search it for 

all kinds of things. You can do all kinds of things not 

related. So if that's what they're relying on, I 

suspect that that's not right, that it had to do with a 

different subject matter.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, I --

All right. Go ahead. I want to get all of them in

she do that?

 MR. PINCUS: Well --

whatever time you want"?

 MR. PINCUS: She did not do it that way.

JUSTICE BREYER: So you're standing there 

and the policeman is in front of you, and they have 

stopped the car, and the woman who is the policeman 

says, "I want to search you." Do you think you're free 

to leave?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor, but --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, then. So now we have

Okay. You're stopped in an urban area. The policeman 

says you are stopped, and you are stopped lawfully. 

Will you get out of the car? Yes. The policeman begins 

to search for the -- the gun. Fine. You think you're 

free to leave?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, obviously it wasn't --

JUSTICE BREYER: What's the fourth? What's 

the fourth? I just want to get them all out here. Is 

there anything else?

 MR. PINCUS: I think we've gotten them all 

out onto the table.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So, what they say is 

a reasonable person would have found -- felt that he 

could just say good-bye, and he would have felt this 

even though the car was stopped lawfully, she asked him 

to get out of the car, and she began to search him for a 

gun.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: I say, can we not reverse 

that?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, a couple of 

things. I don't think the question is at the moment --

clearly, at the moment she was conducting the pat-down 

search, he was seized. But if that were the test, then 

even in the -- in the Terry situation, the person is

obviously in fact seized at the time that the pat-down 

search is conducted, but that's not -- the question is 

whether there was, in the moments before, there was a 

basis to immobilize that person.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm saying if the 

question is whether the person reasonably thought at the 

time of the search he could leave, there's certainly a 

strong claim here that he could not reasonably or he did 

not reasonably think he could leave. As long as that is 

so, the issue in front of us is when you stop a person, 

a policeman in the course of your duties, and that 

person thinks that he cannot reasonably leave, and you 

believe reasonably that he's armed, can you pat him 

down? Well, asked that way, certainly a strong 

argument, the answer is yes, if you don't want to be 

killed.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, I guess a couple of 

answers to that, Justice Breyer. First of all, if this 

is just a case about whether the lower court made a 

correct determination about whether there was a seizure 

or not, there's not -- maybe there's not much to the 

case. We think the lower court did make the right 

determination for the reasons that I gave. And I should 

say, it seems -- it does seem to me, and I was trying to 

get at this point in response to Justice Souter's

question, there are two related questions here. One is 

what a reasonable person in Mr. Johnson's position would 

believe? One is what is the authority of an officer in 

terms of the duration for which a passenger may be 

seized?

 One answer --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if you look at 

the first part of that, what somebody in Mr. Johnson's 

position would believe, how does he tell? I mean, even 

if the other officer goes to the window and starts 

asking the driver, "Can I see your insurance papers," 

there's no representation that's why we stopped you, 

that's all we're interested in. They may have stopped 

him because they have reason to believe that that car 

was involved in criminal activity. They don't have to 

disclose immediately what's involved.

 So how can the passenger know why the 

officer is stopping the person in the first place? 

Hypothesize that he has been involved in criminal 

activity. He may think, well, they've caught me and 

they're just going through this charade to try to get 

information about it and make the people feel 

comfortable, whatever. I mean, just because he says, 

"You don't have insurance papers," that's -- I don't 

think it's reasonable for the passenger to say, "Oh,

this is not about me. I can get up and leave."

 MR. PINCUS: Well, that may not be -- by 

itself, it may not be enough. We think, together with 

the other factors here, the fact --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what else?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, the fact that the officer 

believed, therefore her tone, we have to assume, the way 

she -- that she spoke and the way her subjective intent 

indicated, that she believed what was going on here was 

a conversation in an effort to get gang information --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He is supposed to 

assume that it's not about him because of her tone?

 MR. PINCUS: No, he was supposed to assume 

that it was consensual because of her tone, because that 

was her intent.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we go beyond. I 

mean, once we go beyond, I become a little at sea as to 

what the answers are because policemen do things other 

than investigate crime.

 A policeman is on protective duty. The 

individual he is protecting is approached by a member of 

the Crips gang, who has a bulge in his pocket. Can the 

police, with reasonable grounds to think that that 

person is armed, pat down that person? Or is he 

supposed to wait until the gun comes out of the pocket

and the person who is being protected is shot?

 A policeman is on a bridge. Somebody stops 

the car in the middle of the bridge. Traffic is held up 

in all directions. The policeman goes to try to remove 

the car from the bridge. In the back seat is a member 

of the Crips gang with a bulge in his pocket. Is the 

policeman supposed to ignore that?

 I mean, policemen do many things, and once 

you tell me that we're going beyond the facts of this 

case, I can think of all kinds of hypotheticals that 

aren't so hypothetical, and I become uncertain about 

when the policeman can and when he cannot.

 So, how do you respond?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I think that 

-- first of all, a couple of reactions: First of all, I 

think that it is important, and I alluded to this 

earlier, the sliver of cases we're dealing with here are 

cases in which there is reasonable -- allegedly a 

reasonable suspicion that someone is armed and 

dangerous, but not reasonable suspicion that criminal 

activity is afoot. Those two standards are mutually 

reinforcing. In most cases where there is serious 

evidence that someone is armed and dangerous, you're 

going to have a very -- almost certainly you will have a 

reasonable suspicion that crime is afoot because the

dangerousness part requires -- means you'll have 

suspicion of assault or some other kind of activity. So 

I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Pincus, I want to go 

back to the previous subject for a minute. We certainly 

didn't take this case to decide whether the passenger 

was free to leave or not. That -- that was not the 

issue on which we took the case. And you claim that 

that issue has already been resolved by findings of the 

lower courts?

 MR. PINCUS: That the court of appeals here 

determined -- its decision rested on the fact that this 

was a consensual encounter.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: In order to contradict 

that, would we have to find that that's clearly 

erroneous?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, I think it's a mixed 

question of fact and law, Your Honor. So I think, with 

respect to the underlying facts, you probably have to 

find that --

underlying facts?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, there is a dispute 

as to whether the man thought he was free to leave.

question: Whether -- or whether a reasonable person in

whether he thought he was free to leave -- which would

about why she -- why he was free to leave is because of 

the tone of the arresting officer? The tone of the --

MR. PINCUS: It's the totality of the 

circumstances: The tone of the officer, the fact it was 

in an urban area where there were some place --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And there's no 

finding about the tone of the officer, right?

through in how they interact with someone.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you keep emphasizing 

that this is an urban area, and it seems to me that's 

going to lead to a test that's impossible to administer. 

I can think of a lot of circumstances in which the 

passenger in a car that is stopped will not think for 

practical reasons that there is much alternative but to 

wait until the driver is permitted to get back in the 

car and drive away.

 All of those would fall under your urban 

category, wouldn't they? If it's night -- suppose this 

was a dangerous area. Suppose this was in an area that 

was the turf of a rival gang, so it really wouldn't be 

very practical for this person to start walking down the 

street. There are not just urban areas and rural areas; 

there are expressways in urban areas; there are suburban 

areas.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE ALITO: All of those things would --

you would have to draw a line taking all of those things 

into account.

 MR. PINCUS: It -- it would be a factual 

question in every case as it is in the typical Fourth 

Amendment arrest case about whether someone is seized.

was a factual question in -- in Brendlin. In Brendlin 

we said even when the wrongdoing -- this is at page 7 --

even if the wrongdoing is only bad driving, the 

passenger will expect to be the subject of some 

scrutiny. And his attempt to leave the scene would be 

so obviously likely to prompt an objection from the 

officer that no passenger would feel free to leave in 

the first place. And that's why we held there was a 

seizure. You're basically arguing with the premise of 

Brendlin.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I'm 

absolutely not. I think Brendlin clearly holds that 

there is a seizure at the outset. The question that 

Brendlin does not explicitly address, and it's one the 

Court explicitly --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Brendlin says no passenger 

would like -- would feel free to leave during the course 

of the investigation. And -- and I would have to agree 

with that as a -- as a common-sense matter.

 It would be amazing to me that this fellow 

said: I'm not going to talk to you anymore; I'm 

leaving; and -- and the -- and the police officer would 

allow it, particularly when the police officer, we know, 

searched the person.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you agree that if you 

-- if you lose on the seizure issue, you lose?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, we think if 

-- if there was a seizure, then -- then we think there 

is a -- a second question, which is even if the person 

was seized, it's not clear to us that the Court's 

precedents say that -- that that automatically permits a 

pat down on armed and dangerousness.

 My friends rely on Mimms. The Court in 

Mimms made very clear -- and, in fact, as we recite on 

pages 31 to 32 of our brief -- footnote 5 in Mimms says 

that the reason for the pat down there was that once the 

driver alighted, the officer had independent reason to 

suspect criminal activity and present danger. And it 

was on that basis that the pat-down search was 

permissible.

 So the Court hasn't said that in the context 

of a roadside stop, once you are seized in this, at 

least for a passenger, somewhat different sense than a 

Terry seizure based on articulable suspicion about that 

person's criminal activity, that is enough. We think 

the relevant standard there is supplied by the Court's 

decisions in -- in Summers and associated cases, which 

say the officer can control the scene, and that might 

allow a pat-down search if that's what the officer is

trying to do.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess what about -- I --

I guess if we held that you could do this, this pat-down 

search here, it would probably carry forward to any 

other kind of seizure like a -- a roadblock to inspect 

for drunken driving or anything like that?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, that's -- that's part of 

the concern, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We would say the same 

thing: That if there is a passenger in that car, you 

could tell the passenger to get out and conduct a 

pat-down search.

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, even though -- even 

though, again, there is no particularized suspicion 

about that passenger. So this is a pretty dramatic 

expansion of the officer's ability to -- to search, and 

we think it should be cabined very closely to those 

situations in which there really is a threat of armed 

and dangerous.

 And as I was saying before, "armed and 

dangerousness", "a reasonable suspicion that a crime is 

afoot," are mutually reinforcing. If one isn't present, 

if the State, as here, is arguing that one isn't 

present, it tends to cast doubt on whether the other is 

present.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't the -- why 

isn't the "seizure" and the "consensual" aspect also 

mutually reinforcing but kind of blurring into each 

other? It seems to me it's an awfully difficult 

decision for the officer to make. I stopped this 

person. I know under Brendlin that he is seized, and 

I'm engaged in a dialogue, and I have to worry that at 

some point he thinks he is free to leave.

 MR. PINCUS: I'm -- I'm not sure that I 

understand what you are -- what you are getting at in 

your -- in your question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you seem --

your argument assumes a fairly bright line between the 

point at which the individual is seized and the point at 

which the interaction becomes a consensual search. And 

I'm just saying that in the running line of cases, that 

line is going to be very blurry.

 MR. PINCUS: As it is blurry when the -- in 

the converse situation when the question is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. The converse 

situation is that so long as the interaction continues, 

it is a seizure, and the officer can take reasonable 

steps, the pat down to protect, her safety. That 

doesn't have a line-drawing issue.

 MR. PINCUS: No, I'm talking about the

Drayton situation, Your Honor. When the -- when the 

question is: Has a consensual interaction morphed into 

a seizure, then there is also a -- a -- it's an 

uncertain line. But the Court has said that there it's 

a totality-of-the-circumstances test and, obviously --

sort of -- the shoes are all on the other feet there, 

because the -- law enforcement doesn't want that to 

happen. And so it's arguing that the facts don't amount 

to a seizure, and here we're sort of in the converse 

situation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you don't concede 

in this case, or do you, that Trevizo had a reasonable 

suspicion that Johnson was armed and dangerous? That 

has not been found for purposes of --

MR. PINCUS: Absolutely not. The lower 

court assumed it for the purposes of decision --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So even if you did not 

prevail, we would have to remand on that point?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, that point would have to 

be remanded so that the court below could address it.

 Just to -- just to return to the final 

point, the -- the sliver of cases we're talking about 

here, "armed and dangerousness, but not crime afoot," 

it's a very small sliver. The government hasn't shown 

that that's a real problem that has to be taken care of.

In fact, in this case if the officers really 

had believed that -- that there was proof of "armed and 

dangerousness," why wouldn't they have argued that they 

had proof that crime was afoot, given that they knew 

that Mr. Johnson was a felon? We think that the reason 

that the State took that off the table was it doesn't 

have a lot of confidence in --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is it lawful to possess a 

firearm?

 MR. PINCUS: If you're a convicted felon, 

no?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Was he convicted?

 MR. PINCUS: He had admitted to the officer 

that he had engaged in burglary. In fact, that's one of 

the reasons to show that he's not dangerous is that he 

was very forthcoming about the fact that he had a 

conviction. So the fact that the State took that off 

the table and didn't rely on it, we think, shows, (a), 

that they don't have a lot of confidence that there's 

real "armed and dangerousness" here. And so that the 

"danger" in a systemic sense, as Justice Souter pointed 

out, relying only on that prong as the basis for 

cabining off, is discretionary. As justice Kennedy said 

in a separate decision in Whren, it's very easy to -- to 

conduct an unlawful search.

JUSTICE STEVENS: I have difficulty 

accepting your suggestion that there is a sliver of 

cases. It seems to me there are a multitude of cases in 

which officers might suspect somebody is armed but not 

think criminal activity is afoot, but decide they would 

like to pat them down.

 MR. PINCUS: I think it is the 

"dangerousness" element, Your Honor. If they are "armed 

and dangerousness," which is the test that the Court set 

out in Terry and it is the test that my colleagues are 

asking for, "dangerous," to me, connotes a threat to 

someone. And it's a very small step, I think, between 

being a threat to someone and having a reasonable 

suspicion that an assault may be committed.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you argue in -- in all 

of this that this guy was not dangerous?

 MR. PINCUS: We -- we agree. We argue very 

strenuously that he wasn't dangerous, but -- but I -- I 

think the key point here is -- is that it -- it may well 

be a sliver of cases, but removing the sort of mutually 

reinforcing nature of these two tests threatens to 

really downgrade the standard in a way that officer 

discretion --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could he not be 

dangerous? First, she said: I suspected him because he

was looking behind, but -- and then she said he was 

wearing the clothes of a gang, and then he admits to 

having been convicted of a burglary. Why isn't it very 

normal for a person to be apprehensive?

 MR. PINCUS: All right. Let me give three 

quick answers to those. First of all, he looked -- this 

was an unmarked car, Your Honor. I -- I think a -- a 

very reasonable inference is he looked behind because he 

was surprised that there were, all of a sudden, flashing 

lights and a siren on a car.

 The gang colors, as the lower court -- the 

Court of Appeals here noted, although Mr. Johnson was 

wearing blue, the driver was wearing red. If these were 

really gang colors, it -- it -- it is not consistent 

with the conclusion that they were gang colors to have 

people of different colors who were rival gangs in the 

same car.

 And the third thing is, as lower courts have 

found, acknowledging prior criminal convictions is a 

basis for concluding that someone is not dangerous 

because they were forthcoming.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not so fast.

requirement, does the "dangerous" requirement mean 

endangering the policeman, or is it enough -- is it 

enough if -- if you think this fellow is -- you know, 

he's just a dangerous character. Is that enough, or 

does it have to be an immediate threat to the policeman?

 MR. PINCUS: I don't think this Court has 

come down one way or -- or the other, Your Honor. I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you think?

 MR. PINCUS: It seems to me there -- there 

is a requirement of immediate danger.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's -- it's not enough if 

you think he's -- he's Al Capone?

 MR. PINCUS: I don't think if he's just a 

fishy character, it's enough. I think the reason is 

immediate threat to society.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH L. PARKHURST

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PARKHURST: This -- this case falls 

directly under Mimms and Wilson. Mimms and Wilson both 

hold that the officer has the authority to control the 

occupants of an automobile with or without suspicion of 

any wrongdoing by the occupant.

 In this case, also, the traffic stop

satisfies the first prong of Terry, as we know from 

Mimms. Also, there's no reason to suggest that this was 

any more than the normal length of a traffic stop here. 

In fact, the evidence was that the -- one officer was 

still talking with the driver while Officer Trevizo was 

conversing with Mr. Johnson.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you -- what do you 

say about the other -- the other side's point that in 

the case of a Terry stop there's a -- a mutually 

enforcing -- reinforcing aspect?

 You have a suspicion that -- there is crime 

afoot to begin with, plus the -- the suspicion that the 

person is armed and dangerous; whereas, here, you know, 

it's a traffic stop is all.

 MR. PARKHURST: The -- yes, that's true. 

However, we --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So what -- what is required 

where you think criminal activity is afoot is not 

necessarily going to be the same as what's required when 

you -- when there's just a traffic stop.

 MR. PARKHURST: She -- Officer Trevizo 

testified repeatedly at the hearing that she did not 

believe he was actually about to commit a crime. She 

could not put her -- put her finger on exactly what it 

was that he was doing at the moment.

However, we believe that in the context of a 

traffic stop we -- the State has satisfied the first 

Terry prong here because traffic stops frequently don't 

involve any kind of criminal activity, just as -- as in 

this case, a civil violation. However, that was enough 

to put the officer and the individual in close 

proximity, and if she noticed enough indicia of -- that 

he was dangerous, she certainly was authorized to 

conduct a pat-down search.
