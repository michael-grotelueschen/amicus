3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next in Case 10-1211, Vartelas v. Holder.

 Mr. Bibas. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANOS BIBAS 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. BIBAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court:

 As the Government concedes, INA subsection 

11 101(a)(13)(C)(v), added by IIRIRA, does not expressly 

12 mandate retroactivity. Under Landgraf, applying that 

13 new provision would attach new legal consequences to 

14 pre-IIRIRA offenses, penalizing both those who travel 

and those who don't. 

16  Covered lawful permanent residents could not 

17 visit their parents abroad without being forced to 

18 abandon their children here. They would be removed from 

19 the country or else confined here. Either way, they 

would lose an ability they had under pre-IIRIRA law 

21 based on pre-IIRIRA offenses. Thus, applying the 

22 subsection to them would be impermissibly retroactive. 

23  The settled expectations at issue here are 

24 those of round trips by lawful permanent residents, not, 

as the Government would put it, one-way tickets or 

3

1 first-time entrants. 

2  These are people who have structured their 

3 lives here. They have homes, spouses, children, and 

4 careers here and, yet, have a settled expectation that 

they will be able to maintain ties to visit aged and 

6 ailing parents abroad, to go to funerals and wakes and 

7 visit them in the hospital and surgeries. Our amici, 

8 the NACDL brief and the Asian American --

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: As far as going forward 

is concerned, that's -- that's just the way it is, 

11 right? 

12  MR. BIBAS: Yes, because Congress has 

13 expressly changed the law post-IIRIRA. The question is, 

14 for those before IIRIRA, whether those settled 

expectations are being disrupted. 

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could they -- could 

17 they -- the person who -- who is here and then the new 

18 law is passed -- could that person have petitioned for 

19 discretionary relief before traveling?

 MR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor, that is a 

21 possibility. That is not the same as the automatic 

22 ability to travel, and, in fact, in this case the 

23 discretionary relief was denied. It depends on a 

24 different set of factors from the automatic pre-IIRIRA 

ability to travel. But it is a theoretical possibility

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your 

3 expectations argument is that somebody trying to figure 

4 out whether to go ahead and rob the bank is going to 

say, well, if I do and I'm caught and I'm found guilty, 

6 I won't be able to take temporary trips abroad; so, I'm 

7 not going to rob the bank. 

8  MR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor. First of all, 

9 you phrased it specifically as a reliance argument, 

which is an alternative. Even the Government concedes 

11 it's not a prerequisite. 

12  Second, the right time to look at 

13 expectations is the moment before the law is enacted: 

14 Does one have an expectation at that point that one will 

be able to continue --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're 

17 concerned under Landgraf, I think, with whether or not 

18 it disrupts settled expectations. And it just doesn't 

19 seem to me that this issue enters into the expectations 

at all when the pertinent act, which is the commission 

21 of the crime, not the pleading guilty, takes place. 

22  MR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor, I believe the 

23 practical impact is a new travel disability or penalty, 

24 just as in Landgraf. The discrimination there had been 

illegal for decades; yet, adding a new form of damages

1 to it was impermissibly retroactive. In Hughes 

2 Aircraft, filing false claims with the government had 

3 been illegal for years; yet, broadening the class of 

4 people who could file suit and removing a defense -- no 

reliance possible at all, but there was a settled
 

6 expectation that there would be no additional
 

7 consequences attached to that.
 

8  JUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference
 

9 between someone who commits the crime just before the
 

Act is passed and someone who commits the crime just 

11 after the Act is passed? The person who commits the 

12 crime just after the Act is passed had the expectation 

13 prior to the passage of the Act that if he did certain 

14 things, he wouldn't -- he wouldn't have this consequence 

from his conduct. 

16  MR. BIBAS: Congress, of course, has the 

17 power to change things, but the expectation until an Act 

18 is passed is that the consequences are fixed in time. 

19 And if Congress decides that the potential unfairness is 

outweighed by the benefits of making the Act 

21 retroactive --

22  JUSTICE ALITO: But the person who -- who 

23 commits the crime just after the Act is passed had the 

24 expectation prior to that time, that had -- if he did 

certain things in the future, he wouldn't suffer certain

1 consequences. 

2  MR. BIBAS: And yet, Congress has -- has 

3 affirmatively warned and put everybody on notice that 

4 now there is this new consequence. You may be deterred 

by this new consequence. We may be punishing you by 

6 this new consequence. But the consequence has been 

7 announced. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bibas, I have -- this 

9 is almost a question of personal privilege. You -- you 

make your whole argument on the basis of Landgraf. So 

11 does the Government. You do not cite -- the Government 

12 cites but does not discuss the relevant portion of a --

13 of a later case which involved the same question, 

14 Republic of Austria v. Altmann.

 I concurred separately in Landgraf because I 

16 thought that the test that the Court was using, 

17 upsetting settled expectations, was indeed the proper 

18 test for constitutional provisions forbidding ex post 

19 facto laws, which is where the Court derived it from, 

Justice Story's opinion in a New Hampshire 

21 constitutional case. 

22  But I said in my concurrence that the proper 

23 test for -- for the other issue of retroactivity, 

24 namely, constitutionality aside, does this statute mean 

to be applied only in the future or in the past? And 

7

Official 

1 for that, I propose -- well, I'll read you what we said 

2 in Altmann: 

3  "Our approach" -- which postdates Landgraf. 

4 "Our approach to retroactivity in this case thus 

parallels that advanced by Justice Scalia in the 

6 concurrence in Landgraf." Quote, and it's quoting the 

7 concurrence: "'The critical issue ... is not whether 

8 the rule affects 'vested rights,' or governs substance 

9 or procedure, but rather what is the relevant activity 

that the rule regulates. Absent clear statement 

11 otherwise, only such relevant activity which occurs 

12 after the effective date of the statute is covered. 

13 Most statutes are meant to regulate primary conduct, and 

14 hence will not be applied in trials involving conduct 

that occurred before their effective date. But other 

16 statutes have a different purpose and therefore a 

17 different relative retroactivity event'" -- "'relevant 

18 retroactivity event.'" 

19  And that is what we have here. The -- the 

event that is sought to be regulated is entry into the 

21 United States, and it is clear that this statute applies 

22 only to prospective entry into the United States. It 

23 doesn't apply to past entry so that those people who 

24 came in, in violation of this statute, can be deported. 

Now, why shouldn't we apply that rule in this case, as

1 we did in the Republic of Austria case? 

2  MR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor. As a -- first 

3 of all, our reply brief discussed Altmann, and the 

4 majority of the Court has viewed that as limited to the 

foreign sovereign immunities context. But taking your 

6 test on its own terms --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why would it be limited 

8 just to the foreign sovereign immunities context? 

9  MR. BIBAS: That's the majority's approach. 

But taking your test on its own terms, what you're 

11 pointing out is there is a future --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say that's the 

13 majority's approach? 

14  MR. BIBAS: I'm sorry. The majority in 

Fernandez-Vargas expressly said that Republic of Austria 

16 was in a sui generis context and that its holding 

17 shouldn't be extended to -- to Fernandez-Vargas. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Its -- its holding. 

19  MR. BIBAS: Yes.

 But to take -- to look at your test, you 

21 were pointing out that there is a future event which the 

22 Government -- practically its entire theory turns on 

23 that. But even if there is a future event, there is a 

24 past event being regulated here, and the activity at 

issue under your test would be the pre-IIRIRA offense,

1 not just the innocent post-IIRIRA travel. What we have 

2 is future lawful travel, concededly lawful, nothing 

3 nefarious needs to be shown of it. 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Bibas, how is it 

different then from a felon in possession statute, where 

6 you look at the past offense --

7  MR. BIBAS: Right. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- and then you say, well, 

9 this man, because of that past offense, can't buy a gun 

in the future? How is it different at all? 

11  MR. BIBAS: Your Honor, there are five 

12 pertinent distinctions. Permit me to unpack. 

13  The first and most important is that the 

14 Landgraf test should have a broader scope than the ex 

post facto context in these criminal cases because 

16 Congress can override it expressly. 

17  Since the ex post facto clauses disable both 

18 State and Federal legislatures from acting at all, the 

19 deprivation of power must be narrow and careful so State 

and Federal legislatures can continue to regulate felon 

21 in possession or racketeering or the other crimes the 

22 Government advances. 

23  But Landgraf just tells Congress how to 

24 legislate. It's a background rule. So, it's legitimate 

to have a presumption against retroactivity sweep more 

10

Official 

1 broadly, as Congress is free to override it and, as I 

2 will explain, does override it regularly. 

3  Secondly, felon in possession is inherently 

4 dangerous conduct. This is a protective law. It's not 

just a punitive or deterrent law. 

6  The third and related point is that felon in 

7 possession laws are tailored. There's a nexus to a 

8 danger, a threat to people suffering firearm -- it's 

9 narrowly tailored. Fourth --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why isn't the -- the 

11 government, Congress, making the exact same judgment 

12 here? If the activity to be regulated is entry, and 

13 Congress is making a judgment that we do not want 

14 dangerous people to enter, and we're using the 

conviction, the prior conviction, as a marker for who is 

16 dangerous, and that's exactly what Congress has done in 

17 the felon in possession statute. 

18  MR. BIBAS: Your Honor, I believe the two 

19 are quite different. Felon in possession is limited to 

firearms in the hands of proven dangerous people. Here 

21 we have a law that says you can stay in the country 

22 indefinitely; we're going to discourage you from going 

23 abroad and leaving the country because we'll make it 

24 harder for you to come back. That's not tailored at all 

to protecting the people inside the United States. 

11

25

Official 

1  I'd also point out that the felon in 

2 possession statute, as this Court noted in Heller, is 

3 part of a long tradition of forbidding such activity as 

4 a crime.  So, it's hard to say there are settled 

expectations being upset by felon in possession laws. 

6  And the final one is Congress can do that 

7 simply by being explicit, and it has done so repeatedly 

8 in laws such as IIRIRA. Elsewhere in IIRIRA, section 

9 321(b) says the aggravated felony definition applies to 

convictions entered before, on, or after the statute's 

11 effective date. It knew how to do it; it did it more 

12 than a dozen other times in IIRIRA, as this Court noted 

13 in St. Cyr. It didn't spell it out here. The point of 

14 this --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How about the career 

16 criminal enhancements, instead of the felon in 

17 possession? And assuming your arguments, what limits 

18 can Congress put on anyone with respect to future 

19 conduct if it's going to be a burden? Under your view, 

it stops people from traveling. Career criminal 

21 statutes put on the distinct disadvantage of a longer 

22 sentence. 

23  MR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor, and as we 

24 noted, in the criminal context, this Court in Witte and 

Gryger notes it's a heavier punishment on the new crime 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

25

Official 

1 because it's aggravated, because it's repeated. And 

2 because Congress has more leeway in the ex post facto 

3 context and because recidivism enhancements have a long 

4 tradition, it's entirely legitimate. There's no need to 

say that that's punishing the past offense because the 

6 future offense -- it --- it's permissible to increase it 

7 under the Ex Post Facto Clause. 

8  And that's an inquiry that's different from 

9 the Landgraf test here because all Congress has to do is 

spell out expressly we want to apply this to convictions 

11 entered before, on, or after the statute's effective 

12 date, which it did in 321(b), which it didn't do here. 

13 So, if we were looking at the function of --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that argument that 

you've just made go more to whether or not the BIA's 

16 conclusion that Congress intended to rescind the Fleuti 

17 decision -- but you assume that's what its intent was? 

18  MR. BIBAS: We've assumed arguendo because 

19 that's the premise of the question presented. Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, if we assume that, 

21 if we assume that was Congress's intent, doesn't that 

22 start -- give you the conclusion? If Congress intended 

23 to undo it, doesn't that prove that they intended to 

24 effect it retroactively?

 MR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor, it doesn't. All

1 the case law, the legislative history, the other 

2 discussion was about certain other aspects of entry 

3 doctrine that needed to be changed. The discussion was 

4 express about saying we're changing the definition from 

entry to admission because we don't want people who have 

6 snuck into the country outside of --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. I -- those go 

8 to the basic premise. 

9  MR. BIBAS: Right.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you assume Congress 

11 intended to rescind the prior doctrine, isn't that proof 

12 itself that it intended to apply the statute 

13 retroactively? 

14  MR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To this conduct? 

16  MR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor. Congress can 

17 intend to rescind -- to -- to abrogate a statute such 

18 that it will have no effect going forward, but as this 

19 Court noted in Landgraf, the -- the background default 

rule that the public and Congress expect is that new 

21 laws will apply prospectively. That has the virtue not 

22 only of giving a clear background rule which -- against 

23 which Congress legislates, against which it did 

24 legislate in IIRIRA; but it also forces Congress to 

advert to the potential unfairness of retroactivity and 

14

1 decide that the benefits outweigh it. 

2  That's what this Court said in Landgraf. It 

3 makes perfect sense, and that clear statement rule 

4 serves the function of having them smoke out into the 

open. If you think it's beneficial to make this
 

6 affect convictions in the past, just say so. But it
 

7 didn't.
 

8  So, to go back to our primary point, with
 

9 the practical impact or effect being a new travel
 

disability, the Government's argument seems to boil down 

11 to that, because there is one event that must happen 

12 after the statute's effective date, therefore there can 

13 be no retroactive effect. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that event is the 

event that the government cares about, which is the 

16 entry into the country. It's not as though the -- you 

17 know, the government says -- just picks an event at 

18 random and -- and makes it the trigger mechanism. The 

19 government has picked the event that it wants to 

regulate, which is entry. 

21  MR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor, but this is an 

22 effect test, and under Martin v. Hadix and Landgraf, we 

23 have to take a commonsense functional view of what the 

24 effects are, the new legal consequences. As --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought 

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 your answer to my colleague would be: No, what they 

2 want to regulate is the staying in the country, and 

3 they're trying to make that as uncomfortable as possible 

4 in order to encourage the individual to leave. If he 

can't go to the, you know, parent's party, the cousin's 

6 wedding or whatever, he's just going to leave, and then 

7 once he does, he can't come back. 

8  Why would -- why would the Government 

9 care -- it's a question for them, I'm sure. Why would 

they care whether somebody that they don't want to be 

11 here stays here? It seems to me the exact opposite. 

12 So, I would have thought your argument -- your answer 

13 would be, no, what they're trying to regulate is not the 

14 coming and going, but simply the staying.

 MR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor, you're right 

16 that, particularly given the strange way in which it's 

17 written, it's hard to understand it as something other 

18 than a penalty and possibly a deterrent, but certainly a 

19 penalty based on past crimes, to make life 

uncomfortable. And that does not speak of a protective, 

21 forward-looking exclusive function, if that's the test. 

22  But to go back to the earlier point, if that 

23 were -- if we were to follow the approach Justice Scalia 

24 outlined, that would be the right response. But we 

don't even need to get there because the primary test 

16
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 under Landgraf is not the point or function or purpose, 

2 but an effects test. The effect, as the Government 

3 concedes, is to force him to choose between his parents 

4 in Greece and his wife, children, career, and home here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But there are a lot of --

6 but there are a lot of statutes which we interpret to be 

7 valid, and not retroactive, which have a substantial 

8 effect. You can pass a statute altering the rules of 

9 evidence which have the effect of making someone who 

committed a prior murder convictable; whereas, before, 

11 he was not convictable. 

12  And we don't just look to the effect and 

13 say, well, it has that substantial effect; so, it's 

14 operating retroactively. We say, no, it's a rule of 

evidence. It applies in the future, and that evidence 

16 can come in. 

17  And that's my problem with this other 

18 approach. There are often adverse effects upon 

19 activities that occurred before the statute was enacted, 

but we still regard the statute as prospective only and, 

21 therefore, not subject to special rules for people who 

22 are affected. 

23  MR. BIBAS: Well, setting aside the 

24 difference between the ex post facto context and the 

civil context, and I -- there is the procedural 

17

Official 

1 distinction which I know Your Honor didn't sign on to. 

2 It's also relevant that here it is directly expressly 

3 tied to a past conduct. It's a precondition. It's not 

4 even a piece of evidence or something one can draw an 

inference from. It is a precondition for ineligibility 

6 under 101(a)(13)(C)(v). And, therefore, it looks like 

7 the disability that Justice Story said; a disability has 

8 to involve future conduct. But if it's expressly 

9 disabling future conduct, that's a penalty on past 

conduct. 

11  The disability in St. Cyr of not being able 

12 to apply for future discretionary relief. The 

13 disability in some other cases of this Court that we 

14 found after briefing and alerted opposing counsel to, 

Cummings v. Missouri and Ex parte Garland in volume 71 

16 of the U.S. Reports. Even though the law there forbade 

17 teaching in the future or holding office or preaching or 

18 being a member of the bar, the Government's theory would 

19 say those are post-enactment things; just refrain from 

teaching; you don't have a vested right to teach. 

21  This Court said, no, we recognize those are 

22 expressly targeted to punish the past membership in the 

23 Confederacy that triggers that disability. And so, the 

24 Government's approach would render the Justice Story's 

disability category a nullity.

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it matter in 

2 the examples that you just gave that admission to the 

3 United States is purely a matter of legislative grace, 

4 while we might conclude that teaching, being a member of 

the bar, whatever, is not? 

6  MR. BIBAS: I don't believe that that is 

7 important. That only matters for the vested rights 

8 argument, and this Court in Cummings said expressly it 

9 was dealing with a privilege. So -- moreover --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What --

11 an which privilege was that? 

12  MR. BIBAS: The privilege of teaching or the 

13 privilege of holding office. So, you can't rest on a 

14 right/privilege disposition.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Suppose that might 

16 have been regarded as such then but not under current 

17 law. 

18  MR. BIBAS: Okay. Well, another answer --

19 in St. Cyr, the government made the same argument, and 

this Court said: Well, sure, Congress has the plenary 

21 power to change the rules any time it wants; just do it 

22 expressly. 

23  The question is not whether Congress can, 

24 but whether it has, in fact, changed the rules 

expressly, to make that express tradeoff that the

1 potential unfairness of retroactivity is worth it. 

2  Now, the final point here, I believe there 

3 was some reference earlier to reliance in the offense. 

4 And as the Government concedes, reliance is not a 

prerequisite. This Court can rule for Petitioner and 

6 not even bother with reliance. But the presence of 

7 reliance here is an extra factor that -- that shows the 

8 retroactivity to be obvious and severe. So, the court 

9 of appeals' whole premise that reliance is necessary 

goes away. The Government concedes the court of appeals 

11 implicitly was wrong on that. 

12  As a practical matter, our point is that 

13 defendants rely on the known consequences of offenses 

14 when they decide to plead guilty. As this Court 

recognized in --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When they decide to 

17 plead guilty? 

18  MR. BIBAS: Yes. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The operative issue 

here is when they commit the crime. 

21  MR. BIBAS: We don't claim that there's a 

22 reliance interest in committing the crime, but in the 

23 decision to plead guilty, as a practical matter, the 

24 defendants weigh a number of consequences. And one of 

those is whether they might have a 4-month discount off

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, this -- so, 

this --

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, you draw the line --

7 your position is that only those who have entered a 

8 guilty plea are entitled to the presumption against 

9 non-retroactivity, but not those who've been found 

guilty? 

11  MR. BIBAS: Your Honor, our primary position 

12 is that because reliance isn't necessary, all of them 

13 benefit from it because they all have settled 

14 expectations.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: How do you explain St. Cyr 

16 if reliance isn't necessary? St. Cyr is all about 

17 reliance. 

18  MR. BIBAS: Yes. And at the end of this 

19 Court's opinion, the Court said that the presence of 

this reliance made the retroactive effect especially 

21 obvious and sincere -- especially obvious and severe in 

22 St. Cyr. That did not purport to overrule holdings in 

23 Landgraf and Hughes Aircraft, where there had been no 

24 legally cognizable reliance.

 So, St. Cyr is an easy case because of the

1 guilty plea because of the reliance. But Landgraf and 

2 Hughes Aircraft didn't involve any reliance, and there 

3 was still retroactivity because the settled expectations 

4 were disrupted because there were new consequences 

attached to pre-enactment conduct. 

6  So, regardless of whether there is reliance, 

7 there are settled expectations that are upset by a law 

8 whose function or point is to punish and deter 

9 misconduct based on past wrongs. My client --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We're trying to figure out 

11 what Congress intended, right? We're not talking about 

12 constitutionality. We're talking about a rule that it's 

13 presumed that statutes are only prospective. All right? 

14 And your argument is the reasonable expectation of 

Congress when they passed this was that it would only 

16 apply to -- to people who, what, committed the crime or 

17 were convicted after the statute passed --

18  MR. BIBAS: Yes. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- just as a matter of 

statutory interpretation? 

21  MR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

23  MR. BIBAS: This -- that is the background 

24 default rule against which Congress legislates. And in

1 spells out when it wants to apply to pre-enactment 

2 offenses, to pre-enactment conduct. That's a defeasible 

3 civil retroactivity rule that can reach more broadly 

4 than the ex post facto jurisprudence.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, do you have any case 

6 in which a court has deemed a statute retroactive even 

7 though it wasn't triggered until the party took some 

8 further action? Is there any case out there either from 

9 this Court or from another court where we've said, you 

know, it's retroactive even though it depends upon a 

11 future event? 

12  MR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor. St. Cyr 

13 depended on applying for discretionary relief in the 

14 future. He didn't have to. Cummings depended on trying 

to teach or preach or hold office. Ex parte Garland 

16 depended on trying to practice law in the future. 

17  Those are all disabilities taking away a 

18 future ability based on a past wrong. That's what the 

19 disability category has to mean if it's to remain 

meaningful. And the Government's approach would gut 

21 Justice Story's fourth category. If there are no 

22 further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my 

23 time.

1  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER 

2  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

3  MR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

4 please the Court:

 As the discussion so far this morning 

6 reveals, the Court's retroactivity analysis takes 

7 account of a number of different factors, but the one 

8 that is most significant and, indeed in this case, 

9 virtually dispositive is that the application of section 

1101(a)(13) to Petitioner was triggered only because he 

11 engaged in voluntary conduct that postdated the 

12 enactment of the statute. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: What do you take the trigger 

14 to be? Because in your brief you kept on talking about 

the trigger being the trip. And I would have thought 

16 that you would have talked more about the activity being 

17 the attempt to enter the country. 

18  MR. MILLER: That's -- I mean they're 

19 closely connected together in time, and they both -- but 

they both postdate the enactment of the statute. But 

21 what -- the thing that is being regulated by section 

22 1101(a)(13) is the entry of aliens into the United 

23 States. The statute sets out a comprehensive scheme for 

24 determining when an alien arriving at the border seeking 

to come into the United States should be regarded as 

24

Official 

1 seeking an admission. So, that's conduct that takes 

2 place in the future. 

3  Part (A) of 1101(a)(13) sets out the general 

4 definition of admission, and then (C) sets out a number 

of exceptions. And so, taken together, they are part of 

6 a comprehensive effort to codify Fleuti in some 

7 respects. And, in particular, Romanette (ii), the 

8 180-day provision, is actually a fairly generous 

9 codification of Fleuti, probably extending beyond what 

would have been regarded as a brief trip under Fleuti. 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I have 

12 to -- I just don't understand this statute. This is 

13 somebody we would not allow into the country. And yet, 

14 the only thing we say is you can't leave. I just don't 

understand how that -- how that works. 

16  MR. MILLER: I think there are -- there are 

17 two points to be made about that. And the first is that 

18 that is a feature of the statute writ large. I mean, 

19 that exists even with respect to post-enactment criminal 

convictions. So, it's --

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. Right. 

22  MR. MILLER: And the second, I think to 

23 understand it, it's helpful to look at the history. The 

24 distinction between grounds of inadmissibility and 

grounds of deportability goes back all the way to the 

25

1 1917 Act. In that statute, a single crime of moral 

2 turpitude was a basis for inadmissibility but was 

3 generally not a basis for deportability unless it had a 

4 1-year sentence and was committed within 5 years --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know, and I 

6 understand that there is a limitation on actually 

7 deporting the person. But here I would think the one 

8 thing you want the person to do is leave. Maybe for a 

9 particular event, but maybe he'll decide to stay in 

Greece if once he's there for the -- but it seems very 

11 odd to say we're going to show you how much we don't 

12 want you here; we're not going to let you leave. 

13  MR. MILLER: I think what the -- what the 

14 history shows that it's the crossing the border that has 

always been regarded as a legally significant event. 

16 This Court's cases recognizing --

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wasn't before. 

18 We -- I think we have held that an immigration lawyer is 

19 obliged to tell a defendant faced with a criminal charge 

what the legal -- what the immigration consequences will 

21 be. And here, suppose before the -- at the time of the 

22 plea in this case, the attorney had said, once you've 

23 served your time, you will be able to take brief casual 

24 trips. That would have been accurate advice, right? 

Before IIRIRA.

Official 

1  MR. MILLER: Well, I think -- I think the 

2 most important point about the consequence of the plea 

3 is that, as an immediate result of the plea under 

4 pre-IIRIRA law, so at the time he pleaded guilty in 

1994, he made himself inadmissible. So, that's not 

6 anything that has changed. So, he knew that he was --

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'm asking you, the 

8 lawyer talking to the client -- and the client wants to 

9 know before I enter this plea, what will be the 

consequence for me? And the question that's asked is, 

11 will I still be able to visit my mother in Greece? What 

12 should the lawyer -- what should the lawyer at that time 

13 have answered? 

14  MR. MILLER: I think the lawyer should have 

said, by pleading guilty, you are making yourself 

16 inadmissible to the United States. Under --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: When Rosenberg would have 

18 been the law -- Fleuti -- and the answer to the question 

19 would have been, yes, you can make trips abroad, 

wouldn't it? 

21  MR. MILLER: That's -- that's right. And I 

22 think you might also have said that under a current law, 

23 you will not be regarded as seeking an admission if you 

24 take a brief, casual, and innocent trip. But the change 

in the law --

1  JUSTICE KAGAN: All right. Well, that's 

2 what's going to be important to the person, right? It's 

3 not inadmissible and all the legal terms. Am I going to 

4 be able to make short trips to visit my mother? Yes, 

you are going to be able to make short trips to visit 

6 your mother. 

7  And then you wake up the next morning, and 

8 Congress has passed a statute, and now you're not able 

9 to take short trips to visit your mother. So, something 

very real has happened to the life of this person. 

11  MR. MILLER: That's -- that's right, I mean, 

12 and there is no question but that there is a serious 

13 consequence as a result of the change in the law. But 

14 the Court has made clear in Landgraf and in a number of 

other cases that even uncontroversially prospective 

16 statutes can impose burdens. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: That's true, but in -- in 

18 St. Cyr, as I read it, on pages 322 and 23, the Court 

19 focused directly, not on the crime point of time, but 

the time of the guilty plea. And what the Court says 

21 there is that a person who is thinking of pleading 

22 guilty might well have taken into account the fact that 

23 he could ask the Attorney General later when he's about 

24 to be deported to exercise discretion in his favor.

 So, that's as I read those pages. You can 

28

25

Official 

1 say why I'm not reading them correctly, but that's how I 

2 read them. And then, having read it that way, I thought 

3 the question in this case is whether the person who's 

4 sitting at the table and deciding whether to plead 

guilty or not is likely to think, well, if I plead 

6 guilty, I can always ask for discretion. That's St. 

7 Cyr. 

8  Well, if I plead guilty, I can still visit 

9 my aging parents and grandparents, a matter that could 

be of importance to some people, as opposed to whether I 

11 will never see them again. Now, that seems to be the 

12 question. 

13  Is the second as likely to be in the 

14 person's mind as the first? And to tell you the truth, 

I don't know the answer. I mean, maybe it would be. 

16 There isn't that much chance of getting discretion. It 

17 might be important to some people to visit their aging 

18 parents and grandparents. So, go ahead. Answer the 

19 question. Is the one more important than the other? 

And if not, why not? 

21  MR. MILLER: I think you've correctly 

22 described the reasoning of the Court in St. Cyr, and I 

23 think that that reasoning highlights two ways in which 

24 this case is significantly different. And the first is 

that, in St. Cyr, it was the guilty plea, the 

29
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 conviction, that was legally significant under the 

2 provision of IIRIRA at issue there. And the Court 

3 emphasized that a guilty plea is a quid pro quo. It has 

4 to be knowing and voluntary. The Court cited 

Santobello v. New York, a due process case about guilty 

6 pleas. And then -- so, one difference in this case is 

7 that the legally significant event here --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: No, but I'm really asking 

9 you --

MR. MILLER: -- is not the guilty plea. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: -- isn't my question the 

12 key question? Now, you can answer that "no." But -- I 

13 mean, I suppose you could prove that the only thing that 

14 mattered to -- to LPRs who plead guilty, the only thing 

that mattered, was visiting their parents and 

16 grandparents, a matter I doubt; but, you can say, even 

17 on that situation, it would make no difference, or you 

18 could say I think the one is as important as the other, 

19 or you could say they're not. I just want to get your 

full answer, all -- your whole answer to my question. 

21  MR. MILLER: The conclusion to the first 

22 part of the answer is that it wouldn't make a difference 

23 because what matters here is not the guilty plea; what 

24 triggers the application of 1101(a)(13)(C) is the 

underlying criminal conduct and is --

Official 

1  JUSTICE KAGAN: You're quite right, 

2 Mr. Miller, as a formal matter that that's true, that 

3 that's the words of the statute. But how many times has 

4 the Department of Homeland Security tried to declare a 

person inadmissible on the basis of the commission of a 

6 crime without putting into evidence either a conviction 

7 or a guilty plea? 

8  MR. MILLER: I don't have any --

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: I can't imagine that it's 

like more than on one -- you know, five fingers of your 

11 hand. I mean, that's the way people prove crimes in 

12 this area, isn't it, by convictions or guilty pleas? 

13  MR. MILLER: Well, I would say that -- this 

14 is a statue --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Or convictions after trial 

16 or convictions by guilty pleas. 

17  MR. MILLER: The statute is being applied 

18 by -- in the first instance, by customs officers at the 

19 airport or at the land border crossing. They have 

access to a number of databases which include not only 

21 records of convictions but also things like arrest 

22 warrants. And an arrest warrant by itself would not be 

23 enough to show that a person had, in fact, committed an 

24 offense, but it might well trigger some further inquiry 

from the customs officer that would lead to them finding

1 out more information or perhaps getting an admission 

2 from the person. 

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: If, as a fact of the matter, 

4 the way the commission of crime is proved in this area 

is through showing a conviction, does your distinction 

6 stand up at all? 

7  MR. MILLER: I mean, there is still, I 

8 think, a significant formal distinction, and then 

9 there's also another important distinction from St. Cyr, 

which is that that was a case where, as a result of the 

11 guilty plea plus the change in law, the person there 

12 faced immediate deportability with no prospect of 

13 discretionary relief. And the Court said that there is 

14 a clear difference, for purposes of the retroactivity 

analysis, between a possibility of deportability and a 

16 certainty of deportation. 

17  Here, not only is he not deportable, but 

18 there's no immediate consequence for him at all. The 

19 statute only has any effect on him when he engages in 

the post-enactment travel. And I think --

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the 

22 characterization? Which seemed to me to make common 

23 sense. Yes, the trigger is that he has gone abroad and 

24 is returning. But the target, they say, was the crime. 

That's why the law -- the law really doesn't care about

1 the travel back and forth; what it cares about is that 

2 this person was convicted of a crime. 

3  MR. MILLER: I -- I don't think that's 

4 correct, Your Honor, and I think that highlights one of 

the distinctions between this case and Cummings v. 

6 Missouri and Ex parte Garland. 

7  In those cases, you had statutes that were 

8 nominally prospective in application, but the Court 

9 actually said that we think that what's really happening 

here is that the statutes are imposing punishment for 

11 the completed acts. To the extent there was any doubt 

12 in those cases themselves, this Court discussed them 

13 both in Harisiades v. Shaughnessy and said that it 

14 viewed them as cases about punishment. This is not a 

statute --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't that the case 

17 here, meaning -- it goes back to the Chief Justice's 

18 question, which is what they're trying to do is punish 

19 those individuals, those LPRs, who have committed this 

kind of crime, by not letting them travel or come back 

21 in. That's really what their argument is, is -- you 

22 know, you are imposing a punishment, a disability, for 

23 having committed the crime. You're not imposing a 

24 disability merely for the act of traveling.

 MR. MILLER: I mean, I think when you look

1 at the statute as a whole, you see that it's a -- it's a 

2 comprehensive regulation of crossing the border, which 

3 has always been regarded as a legally significant event. 

4 There are six subparts to 1101(a)(13)(C). Five of them 

have nothing to do with past conduct. They're about the 

6 nature of the trip and what the alien is doing as he's 

7 coming in. 

8  And then you have -- have this one, which is 

9 of a piece with the long history of drawing a 

distinction between inadmissibility and deportability. 

11 And I think it recognizes --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the -- what 

13 is the policy underlying the rule that doesn't allow 

14 somebody who has a lawful status here to go to his 

grandmother's funeral --

16  MR. MILLER: I -- I --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and come back? 

18 It's going to take 4 days. He goes; he comes back. 

19 What policy supports prohibiting that travel?

 MR. MILLER: I mean, I -- I think it 

21 reflects a -- a judgment over -- on the part of Congress 

22 over many, many years that it is one thing to say to an 

23 alien, all right, we're not going to go and try and find 

24 you and take you and kick you out of the country. It is 

quite another to say you may freely cross our borders;

4 different things, but I don't know that you've 

articulated what the policy is to prevent -- prohibit 

6 somebody from doing that. 

7  MR. MILLER: I mean, other than referring 

8 you to -- to the history and to the idea that's been 

9 reflected -- you know, this Court has recognized that 

control over the border is a core sovereign prerogative 

11 that lies at the heart of Congress's immigration power. 

12 And I think that --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose you could 

14 say that there's a likelihood of quite inequitable 

enforcement if indeed you adopt a position we're going 

16 to pick up all of these people and send them away. 

17 That's not going to happen. It'll -- it'll be hit and 

18 miss. 

19  And, on the other hand, you can enforce it 

rigorously and equitably upon everyone if you only 

21 forbid reentry to those people who want to come back in 

22 and who have to, you know, give their names to 

23 Immigration, and you can check on -- on this status. 

24  That seems to me a sensible reason.

 MR. MILLER: That's right. And --

25

Official 

1  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But why do you 

2 -- look, as I read the statute, it isn't even clear 

3 whether it overrules Rosenberg v. Fleuti. I mean, they 

4 talk about admission, but admission, after all, 

could have an exception for the 4-day trip. That's what 

6 the Court said effectively in Rosenberg v. Fleuti. 

7  So, Congress certainly wasn't clear on what 

8 policy they're following. I would have thought that. 

9 You can disagree with that. But I -- because -- but the 

part that's still gnawing at me 95 percent of the people 

11 plead guilty. All right. You know. Everybody pleads 

12 guilty. All -- about. About. And now, the consequence 

13 that this ex post enacts is he can't take the 4-day 

14 trip.

 And you keep saying, well, a 4-day trip 

16 requires action on a person's part. Right. Of course, 

17 it does. So, why does that matter? I mean, the fact is 

18 he can't take the 4-day trip. A 4-day trip requires 

19 action. You have to buy a trip -- ticket. You have to 

get on a plane. So --

21  MR. MILLER: Well, i think -- if I could 

22 just first address the -- the question of whether the 

23 statute, in fact, abrogates Fleuti, and just to be clear 

24 on that -- the question presented assumes that it does. 

Petitioner isn't challenging that. And the Board, in

1 the Collado-Munoz decision, has explained why the -- the 

2 statute, in fact, does have that effect. 

3  And I think that the significance of this 

4 post-enactment conduct, the significance of the trip, is 

illustrated by this Court's decision in 

6 Fernandez-Vargas, which made clear that when you have --

7 when the application of the statute is within the 

8 control of the person to whom it's being applied, 

9 because he has to do something after it comes into 

effect -- there, it was choosing to remain in the United 

11 States and becoming subject to the reinstatement of a 

12 prior order of removal -- here, it's taking the travel. 

13 But that goes a long way towards establishing that it 

14 doesn't have a retroactive effect, that it's regulating 

future conduct. 

16  Another --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Prior to the Fernandez 

18 case, the illegal act was remaining. And so, that was 

19 within your control. But the -- you can't undo an 

illegal act that you've done to be able to travel. The 

21 act is now part of your background. And so, there's 

22 nothing in your control to change that act once the 

23 statute has passed. 

24  MR. MILLER: Well --

2  MR. MILLER: In Fernandez-Vargas, the 

3 conduct that subjected the alien to the application of 

4 this -- this procedural -- this disadvantageous removal 

procedure was remaining in the United States. 

6  And it's true that that conduct was 

7 unlawful, but for purposes of the retroactivity 

8 analysis, the Court didn't focus on whether it was 

9 lawful or unlawful. What matters is that it was conduct 

that was in the future, that was after the statute was 

11 enacted. 

12  And so, here, although the -- the trip is 

13 not unlawful in that sense, it is future conduct. And 

14 here, as in Fernandez-Vargas, there is ample warning --

which was another point that the Court emphasized in 

16 that case -- ample warning that the statute would be 

17 applied to people who engaged in that conduct. 

18  I do want to address your --

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: It -- it can't be right that 

it's any future conduct. If -- if there's a trigger 

21 mechanism that is entirely random, you know, it's -- you 

22 can be deported if you've committed a crime of moral 

23 turpitude in the past, but not until you go to the 

24 movies on a Saturday.

 Surely, that would not change the analysis.

1  MR. MILLER: I think that's right, Your 

2 Honor, and I think the reason it wouldn't is reflected 

3 in some of this Court's -- in the ex post facto 

4 analysis.

 If you have a statute that, for example, 

6 makes it a crime to have engaged in certain conduct in 

7 the past and then, you know, something -- some 

8 commonplace, utterly trivial activity in the future, I 

9 think a court looking at that would say this is not --

although it is nominally prospective, this is really a 

11 statute aimed at punishing the prior conduct. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I don't know. 

13 I think it would be prospective and unconstitutional 

14 because it's irrational. I mean, not everything that's 

unconstitutional is unconstitutional -- not everything 

16 that is unconstitutional is not prospective, it seems to 

17 -- or do you think that's so? 

18  If it's -- if it is unconstitutional in 

19 violation of the ex post facto law, the statute has to 

be -- has to be prospective. I'm sorry. Has to be 

21 assumed not to cover that prior conduct. Is that right? 

22  MR. MILLER: I mean, I think -- the 

23 hypothetical statute I was describing I think would 

24 violate the Ex Post Facto Clause under the sort of 

analysis that this Court used in Smith v. Doe, in a

1 holding that --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. And if it does, it 

3 automatically has to be interpreted not to cover that? 

4  MR. MILLER: I mean --

JUSTICE SCALIA: By reason of the 

6 presumption of expectation --

7  MR. MILLER: Oh, you mean -- if you mean a 

8 parallel statute in the civil context. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, yes.

 MR. MILLER: I -- I think that's the best 

11 reading of Landgraf, and I think under -- under the 

12 analysis suggested in your concurring opinion in 

13 Landgraf --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Yes.

 MR. MILLER: -- I think one would look at 

16 that statute and say this is really a statute that's 

17 aimed at regulating the past conduct, and that -- that 

18 has a retroactive effect. 

19  So, I mean, to finish that thought, I think 

I would just say that there is a narrow category of 

21 cases where you have what is in form a prospective 

22 regulation that's really aimed at -- aimed at burdening 

23 or punishing a past act. But this is not that. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: And how do we separate those 

two? How do we decide that this is not that, and that

1 it's instead something else, that it's a regulation of 

2 future conduct? 

3  MR. MILLER: I -- in the criminal context, 

4 the Court has used the analysis of Kennedy v. 

Mendoza-Martinez to figure out whether a statute is --

6 is imposing additional punishment for past conduct. And 

7 that looks at a number of factors, and the most 

8 important factor under that test, the Court has said, is 

9 whether the statute appears to be related to a 

legitimate prospective regulatory purpose. 

11  And so, that's why, for example, statutes 

12 like 922(g), the felon in possession statute, which was, 

13 I would point out, amended just back in 1996 to add 

14 misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence, which had not 

previously been something that would subject one to a 

16 firearms disability -- that was added. 

17  Every court of appeals that has considered 

18 the question has held that it doesn't violate the Ex 

19 Post Facto Clause and, I think, implicitly has held that 

it does in fact reach that conduct. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Even -- even if you had 

22 pleaded guilty to spousal abuse? 

23  MR. MILLER: I'm not aware of any cases --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. MILLER: -- specifically addressing that

1 question, but -- but, yes, because there you have a 

2 statute that is regulating future conduct. It only 

3 applies to somebody who engages in the future conduct. 

4 The sex offender registration laws are another example 

that this Court has upheld. That kind of law obviously 

6 imposes a very significant burden on people on the basis 

7 of prior conduct, but the fact that there is some burden 

8 by itself does not mean that the statute is retroactive. 

9  Nor does it mean that it's appropriately 

viewed as imposing a disability. I mean, I think that 

11 the Court in Landgraf quoted Justice Story's formulation 

12 of a disability as referring to statutes that impose a 

13 disability in respect to transactions that are already 

14 passed. So, it is not enough that there used to be 

something that you could do, and now, in the future, 

16 you're not going to be able to do that. That's not a 

17 disability in the relevant sense, and if it were, I 

18 think the Court would have a very difficult line-drawing 

19 problem to figure out why it is that statutes like 

922(g) are okay, or sex offender registration laws, or 

21 any number of --

22  JUSTICE BREYER: That's -- that's why I 

23 think the Chief Justice's question and the ambiguity of 

24 the statute are relevant. Like with SORNA you would 

apply it backwards, because that's a pretty clear

1 intent. 

2  I don't know about, you know, like, "three 

3 times and you're out" statutes, et cetera. But -- but 

4 here you have the disability on the one -- the 

disadvantage to the person pleading guilty, that 

6 problem, on the one hand; and, on the other hand, you 

7 have the policy that with a -- fill in the blank --

8 with a statute that doesn't talk about it but simply 

9 uses a new definition of admission or admissibility. 

That's -- do you want to say something about that? 

11  MR. MILLER: I think, if you're -- if you're 

12 asking whether Congress has specifically addressed the 

13 temporal scope of the statute, we -- we acknowledge 

14 under St. Cyr that it hasn't. And so, that's why we're 

at step two of the --

16  JUSTICE BREYER: More than that, what is --

17 I'm ignoring -- more than that, I'm saying what's the 

18 policy on the other side? The policy that favors the 

19 retroactivity despite the fact that the person might not 

have pleaded guilty? And that's why I was interested in 

21 the Chief Justice's question and also the ambiguity of 

22 the language in the statute that they used. 

23  MR. MILLER: I think that the -- the policy 

24 is Congress was trying to redefine -- I mean, they were 

replacing the old term of "entry" and -- with a new

1 concept of admission. They're trying to redefine a 

2 comprehensive scheme for regulating the treatment of 

3 aliens arriving at the border. And I think that you 

4 have to look at all the parts of it together as a scheme 

that was to be applied going forward, when people 

6 arrived at the border in the future, after the enactment 

7 of the statute. 

8  If there are no further questions --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you go over 

again for me your distinction of St. Cyr? 

11  MR. MILLER: I think it's twofold, Your 

12 Honor. The first is that, in St. Cyr, the legally 

13 significant event was the conviction. It was the guilty 

14 plea. Here, the guilty plea is significant because it 

makes Petitioner inadmissible, but that was true under 

16 current law. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't argue that 

18 -- that the significance of what the individual is 

19 giving up makes a difference?

 MR. MILLER: That's our second point, is 

21 that St. Cyr said there is a big difference between 

22 immediate deportability and the potential --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there -- is there 

24 a difference in terms of what they face if they don't 

plead guilty? I've always had difficulty with St. Cyr

1 and the notion that, say, someone pleads -- is facing, 

2 you know, 10 years, and they plead -- plead guilty to 2 

3 years, that the -- the reason they did that is to, you 

4 know, avoid one of these immigration provisions. It 

seems to me it is to avoid 8 years. 

6  MR. MILLER: I --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I just wonder if 

8 the relative significance of what is at issue under the 

9 immigration law is something that we can take into 

account, or if St. Cyr prohibits that? 

11  MR. MILLER: No, I think it is certainly 

12 appropriate to take into account, that however --

13 however significant the application of Fleuti might be 

14 to aliens, it's on a different order of significance 

from --

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Miller, the 

17 Solicitor General actually represented to us -- in the 

18 Judulang argument, used that as an example, the Fleuti 

19 case, as something that people doing pleas did think 

about and did rely upon. 

21  MR. MILLER: Well, I think -- I mean, we 

22 don't question that that's something that people might 

23 have -- have been aware of and have been thinking about, 

24 but it's not something that was bargained for in the 

plea agreement because it's not something that's

1 affected by the plea agreement. 

2  The statute here is triggered by the 

3 post-enactment conduct of entering the country but also 

4 by the -- the pre-enactment conduct of committing the 

crime. And, as Petitioner has acknowledged, there isn't 

6 any reliance in the state of immigration law when you 

7 choose to commit the crime. And so, I think that's --

8 that's a difference from the scenario that was addressed 

9 in Judulang.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANOS BIBAS 

16  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

17  MR. BIBAS: Thank you, Your Honor. I'd like 

18 to make five points. 

19  The first one is the statute is poorly 

tailored to any protective or forward-looking effect. 

21 As the Court has noted, its perverse effect is to 

22 discourage people from leaving the country, to keep them 

23 in. So, any idea that the purpose is to get them out 

24 just doesn't square with the way the statute is written.

 As Justice Ginsburg noted, while the

Official 

1 post-IIRIRA innocent travel may be the trigger here, the 

2 obvious target is the pre-IIRIRA offense. The statute 

3 is tied to misconduct. The natural inference of making 

4 misconduct not just a piece of evidence but a 

prerequisite is that it is the misconduct that is being 

6 penalized. 

7  Second, the impact, we suggest, is the 

8 relevant test. The impact is a penalty. It is a 

9 disability based on a past act that Mr. Vartelas is now 

helpless to undo. That is all that is required under 

11 Landgraf. If Congress thinks it important, it can 

12 expressly require retroactivity, but it hasn't done so. 

13  Third, let me make clear that we have 

14 alternative theories here. Reliance is something that 

makes the case worse. It is something that exacerbates 

16 the problem, makes it obvious and severe. And our 

17 amici, the NACDL brief, points out very movingly how 

18 important these kinds of considerations are in 

19 immigrants' decisions to plead guilty. Here, for 

example, my client received a 4-month discount off his 

21 sentencing range. It's entirely plausible to believe 

22 that immigrants in his situation might value the ability 

23 to stay in the same country with their 4-year-old and 

24 2-year-old child as much as 4 months in jail.

 But our broader theory is that the violation 

47
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 of settled expectations is sufficient, whether or not 

2 there's reliance. The settled expectation that one has 

3 of planning one's life in this country and yet having 

4 relatives abroad one will tend to or care for their 

business, et cetera -- that is sufficient. Just as in 

6 Landgraf and Hughes Aircraft, there were no legally 

7 cognizable reliance interests in discriminating or in 

8 submitting false claims, but changing the penalties is 

9 enough.

 Fourth, this Court's decision in St. Cyr, I 

11 believe, strongly helps our case. The first reason is 

12 that it imposed a disability, a disability on filing in 

13 the future for discretionary relief, but as a practical 

14 matter, it's burdening past conduct.

 Secondly, St. Cyr didn't purport to change 

16 the holdings in Landgraf and Hughes Aircraft that those 

17 are other ways of showing impermissible retroactivity. 

18 The logic in St. Cyr is ineluctable that because you are 

19 burdening a decision, a decision that, as the -- the 

Court and the amici in St. Cyr noted, matters greatly 

21 and factors into things like the plea bargaining 

22 calculus, that the retroactivity is especially obvious 

23 and -- and severe. 

24  And let me note that St. Cyr was decided under 

this same statute, a privilege, not a right, a privilege

1 that Congress can abrogate at any time. That did not 

2 influence this Court's holding at all. The 

3 right/privilege distinction is dead in this area of law. 

4 If there is a privilege under IIRIRA to apply for 

discretionary relief, there is a privilege to not be
 

6 subject to the disability on one's traveling and
 

7 returning.
 

8  Finally, let me talk about the
 

9 criminal/civil line. I believe my brother here
 

introduced Smith v. Doe and mentioned some of the sex 

11 offender cases. I've explained why the criminal cases 

12 in ex post facto are different, but let me go into some 

13 more detail as the Court is well familiar with 

14 Smith v. Doe. That was a civil case that Doe attempted 

to turn into a criminal case under the very demanding 

16 standard in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez. But that's a 

17 very uphill fight. As the Court's opinion recognized, 

18 the court must be very deferential before turning 

19 something facially civil into criminal because then it's 

categorically forbidden and it comes with the criminal 

21 procedure protections in the Bill of Rights. 

22  That's not what we're doing now. We're not 

23 trying to say this law is forbidden. Smith v. Doe 

24 involved a law where the Court's opinion said on its 

face the legislature made it retroactive; it says it's 

49

1 retroactive. The Federal law SORNA is expressly 

2 retroactive in section 113(d). IIRIRA is expressly 

3 retroactive. That's a different inquiry, where you're 

4 asking, does the Ex Post Facto Clause forbid something 

that's expressly retroactive? Does Mendoza-Martinez 

6 turn it into a criminal case? 

7  Versus here, where it's not retroactive. 

8 All Congress has to do is spell it out. If this Court 

9 adheres to its previous jurisprudence, the guidance to 

the drafters across the street is clear: Just draft the 

11 statutes the way you've always been doing it; say 

12 before, on, or after effective date. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think we have the 

14 authority to tell Congress how to draft its laws? I 

thought what we were doing was trying to infer what they 

16 intended. 

17  MR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Do we send them a drafting 

19 manual? Now, you can do this, but you can only do it if 

you do it -- if you follow the steps that we've 

21 prescribed. And you've said this over and over. It 

22 seems to be completely unfounded. 

23  MR. BIBAS: Your Honor, this Court has said 

24 that it's important to adhere to its traditional tools 

of statutory construction because it's a settled

1 background rule against which Congress legislates, which 

2 it is aware of. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: And you think Landgraf is 

4 clear and settled, and you're -- you're over there in 

Congress, and you say, boy, I know how this statute is 

6 going to come out under Landgraf --

7  MR. BIBAS: Yes, Your Honor. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- better than I am. 

9  MR. BIBAS: Let me explain. This Court 

decided Landgraf two decades ago. A few years after 

11 Landgraf, Congress passed IIRIRA in 1996. IIRIRA 

12 contains express retroactivity provisions that go 

13 hand-in-glove with the Landgraf presumption. 

14  And then Congress passed SORNA, to which my 

brother alludes. SORNA in 2005 likewise in section 

16 113(d) says, yes, this sex offender registration shall 

17 apply; the Attorney General can apply it to people with 

18 pre-SORNA convictions. Congress understands the 

19 Landgraf presumption. In those statutes and others, it 

has legislated against it. It can continue to do it 

21 because this Court should continue to use its 

22 traditional tools of statutory construction. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that can be explained 

24 because Congress understands that who knows whether it's 

going to be held to be retroactive or not. If you -- if
