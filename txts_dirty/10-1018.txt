3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next this morning in Case 10-1018, Filarsky v. Delia.

 Ms. Millett. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court:

 When a private attorney is temporarily 

11 retained by the government to work in coordination with 

12 or under the direct supervision of government employees 

13 in fulfilling the government's business, in getting the 

14 government's work done, that attorney is entitled to the 

same immunity that a government employee performing that 

16 same function for that same government would receive. 

17 In this case, that is qualified immunity. That rule 

18 comports with the history and policy concerns that have 

19 animated this Court's section 1983 and immunity 

jurisprudence. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's across the board, 

22 Ms. Millett, the rule you just stated? Is there any 

23 situation in which a private attorney engaged to assist 

24 a government office in the performance of a public 

function would lack qualified immunity? Or is it simply 

3

25

Official 

1 wherever a government agency employs a private attorney 

2 to assist it in doing its work, that attorney will have 

3 qualified immunity? 

4  MS. MILLETT: I think it -- it may well be 

the latter rule, the more broader one, but for these 

6 purposes, the Court only needs to decide the situation 

7 when they are working in coordination with or under 

8 direct supervision of government employees. And I want 

9 to clarify that answer because how one defines doing a 

public service -- for example, if a State government 

11 appoints somebody to represent one of their police 

12 officers who's sued in a 1983 action, if there's five 

13 defendants, the attorney general can't represent them 

14 all; they will all commonly appoint people and will pay 

them -- some States will pay them from the -- from the 

16 State fisc. 

17  And so, they'll be paid by the government to 

18 perform a governmental function in that sense, but their 

19 allegiance there is to the individual employee, not to 

the government. The same with public defenders. 

21  So, there are certain situations where 

22 someone can be retained by the government in that sense, 

23 paid by the government in that sense. 

24  JUSTICE ALITO: Why does it matter whether 

the privately retained attorney works in close 

4

Official 

1 cooperation with government employees? Suppose in this 

2 case Mr. Filarsky had simply been hired to go off and 

3 perform this investigation and, at the end of the 

4 investigation, report the results to the town? Would 

the case come out differently then? 

6  MS. MILLETT: I don't think that would, but 

7 in this -- but I think it depends on what one means by 

8 coordination with or supervision. And with respect to 

9 attorneys, attorneys can never be an independent 

contractor in relationship to their client in the way 

11 the prison was in Richardson. Attorneys just can't be. 

12 They are always, in the sense of the rule that I'm using 

13 it, working for their client agency, their client 

14 government, and under its control and authority. And 

the decisions they make are the decisions of that 

16 client. 

17  And that's why the whole -- the whole reason 

18 we should have this rule is understanding what immunity 

19 protects. It protects government decisionmaking, 

governmental conduct, and its ability to maneuver with 

21 an area -- in an area of reasoned decisionmaking. 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I -- I suppose you can 

23 argue that there is a built-in limitation because the 

24 question doesn't even come up unless there's state 

action. So, there has to be close enough cooperation so 

5

Official 

1 there's state action. I had never thought that when a 

2 private attorney gives an opinion letter to a government 

3 agency or government entity at its request that there's 

4 any state action there at all. So, that question -- so, 

there the question just wouldn't even come up; am I 

6 correct? I assume --

7  MS. MILLETT: Right, because, certainly, the 

8 state action limitation both limits the operation of 

9 this rule. There's many times attorneys or others who 

work with the government will not implicate the state 

11 action rule. And that's sort of the irony of -- of this 

12 case, and I think it would not be uncommon in attorney 

13 cases. The only reason this was a tort, or an alleged 

14 tort, is because the government was involved, because 

governmental actors took his advice, conducted a 

16 search -- he didn't -- issued an order -- he didn't. 

17 And yet we have -- we're left in this is odd world where 

18 the only way this tort, constitutional tort lawsuit, can 

19 go forward is without the government.

 Now, 1983 is about deterring governmental 

21 conduct, but this Court's immunity jurisprudence says we 

22 don't over-deter and we want to allow the government to 

23 operate within a realm of reasoned decisionmaking. And 

24 they need to operate within that realm, get reasoned 

advice and make reasoned decisions, regardless of 

6

1 whether the source of the advice is a temporarily or 

2 permanently retained attorney. 

3  The need is for reasoned decisionmaking. 

4 And if you over-deter, which is what an action against 

the private attorney who is now charged with litigating 

6 and defending the government's allegedly 

7 unconstitutional conduct, standing all alone while all 

8 the government actors have walked away -- that turns 

9 section 1983 on its head.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your test -- and 

11 this is -- I think goes broader than the articulation of 

12 the test -- doesn't give this private attorney much 

13 assurance by itself. It's sort of a multifactor, is he 

14 coordinating, is he under the supervision, is he really 

doing public service? I mean, if the idea is to give 

16 him sufficient breathing room so he doesn't stop, and 

17 when, as in this case, he's threatened that we're going 

18 to sue you if you do this, he has to think, well, now, 

19 am I being supervised by the government? Am I 

coordinating with the government? Or I -- am I telling 

21 them what -- it -- the test itself undermines the 

22 asserted purpose. 

23  MS. MILLETT: Well, two responses to that. 

24 First of all, the State law requirement -- the state 

action requirement that Justice Kennedy referred to will 

7
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 up front require allegations by the plaintiffs that will 

2 discuss the coordinated -- presumably the coordinated 

3 action. There's going to have to be some level of 

4 coordination.

 But the second reason is, as I said, with 

6 respect to attorneys, I don't think this is going to be 

7 a hard question because they are forever agents and 

8 fiduciaries. They can never be the independent 

9 contractor that you had in Richardson. They are always 

answerable to and working for their governmental client. 

11 And when I say "supervision" here, I don't think the 

12 test here is -- is an on-hands, day-to-day looking over 

13 your shoulders. The government has to be able to get 

14 the advice of professionals and to trust them --

JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose -- suppose the 

16 government hires an attorney to do an independent 

17 investigation; it hires an outside attorney precisely 

18 because it does not want to be faced with allegations 

19 that it has manipulated the outcome of the investigation 

because its own conduct is at issue. So, they say 

21 you're going to be independent, hands-off; we're not 

22 going to interfere at all. But that would still in your 

23 -- in your submission satisfy the coordination 

24 requirement?

 MS. MILLETT: It -- it would in this sense, 

8
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 because there would be -- and I'm assuming here we're 

2 not talking like a Bivens appointment or something like 

3 that. But here -- because understand what happens in 

4 that situation. They're being appointed to investigate 

for the government and on behalf of the government. 

6  And it's not usually because we say the 

7 government writ large may have done something that would 

8 create a conflict. It may be an individual employee or 

9 something. That's where the conflict comes. But 

they're working for the government. The government is 

11 their client. They are not freewheeling independent 

12 contractors. And --

13  JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference 

14 between that and the prison situation? The private 

prison -- the guard in the private prison is performing 

16 a function that has been delegated to that or assumed by 

17 that entity pursuant to a contract. I don't understand 

18 exactly what the difference is. 

19  MS. MILLETT: The difference is -- there's a 

practical difference and then a legal doctrinal 

21 difference. The practical difference is that, in 

22 Richardson, it was a quite unique situation where the 

23 government really had washed its hands of the prison 

24 operation. It had put the day-to-day operation of the 

prison, the decisionmaking of the prison, how we treat 

9

Official 

1 the prisoners, entirely in the hands of a private 

2 contractor, subject only to what this Court said was 

3 very limited supervision, essentially in contract terms. 

4 But it had ceded that authority, and it did not exercise 

a control.  It did not exercise the day-to-day 

6 decisionmaking. And that's where we get into the 

7 doctrinal point. 

8  So, the decisions that were being made there 

9 and that there were -- the lawsuit concerned, there 

wasn't a single governmental defendant named in that 

11 case. It was just the private -- the private guards 

12 that were at issue there. And the decisions that were 

13 made were the private company's decisions. 

14  And so, this Court said there that's not 

what qualified immunity is out -- is out to protect. It 

16 is to protect what? The government's decisionmaking, 

17 the special concerns that arise when you are bringing 

18 lawsuits that are designed to regulate, limit, deter 

19 governmental decisionmaking. We have to protect that 

area of reason. 

21  If the government's not making the decision, 

22 they've passed the buck, they've handed it off, then 

23 there's nothing to protect. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't that the case 

here?

Official 

1  MS. MILLETT: I'm sorry? 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It seems to me that 

3 there's enough evidence that the lawyer was the one who 

4 held the investigation; the people who attended the 

meeting between the lawyer, the Respondent, and the 

6 other personnel that were there were acceding to what he 

7 was doing. The chief -- he goes to the chief and he 

8 says: I want you to do this. And the chief is relying 

9 on him, not his own independent judgment, to issue the 

command that's contested here. 

11  So, that sort of puts your argument on its 

12 head because it appears that he was more the independent 

13 investigator --

14  MS. MILLETT: No --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- than he was the 

16 individual under the control of the agency. 

17  MS. MILLETT: Okay. Well, first of all -- a 

18 couple of responses. First of all, no, that's nothing 

19 like Richardson. This was the government's 

investigation. They initiated it. They brought him on 

21 to the team for his expertise, much like prosecutors 

22 might bring on a psychologist to evaluate a criminal 

23 defendant. Now, are the prosecutors going to sit there 

24 and say, you know, Psychologist, you should ask this 

question? Or are they going to defer to the medical 

11

1 expertise? That's a --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This argument seems to 

3 fall under what Justice Scalia termed a functional test, 

4 that he's serving just like any other government lawyer. 

If you were going to fit this case under the Richardson 

6 majority test, how would you do it? 

7  MS. MILLETT: And I'd do that -- first of 

8 all, I keep -- I'm putting it right in -- in 

9 Richardson's language, which said it was reserving this 

very question, and that is, when an attorney or any 

11 individual is working in close coordination or under the 

12 supervision of government officials in the performance 

13 of an essential function. 

14  And so, that makes clear that Richardson was 

deciding not that situation, the handed-off turnkey 

16 situation. This -- there's no turnkey here. This is 

17 Mr. Filarsky being brought on to the team. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so, independent 

19 counsel would not be covered. I mean, if you have, you 

know, a counsel appointed because -- to show that the 

21 administration is disinterested in this prosecution and 

22 you get independent counsel, the Attorney General says: 

23 I will not interfere with him. The President says: I 

24 will not interfere with him. Then him you can -- you 

can sue without any immunity, right?

1  MS. MILLETT: No. And that's --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? He's not working in 

3 close coordination. He's not subject to supervision. 

4 The whole purpose of an independent counsel is to 

eliminate supervision. 

6  MS. MILLETT: Yes, but independent counsel 

7 is still sued in the name of the United States. Their 

8 client was the United States Government. That is 

9 whom -- that is the interest in which they worked. They 

were -- they had a client that they were answerable to. 

11 They were not freewheeling independent contractors; they 

12 were attorneys with a client. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Weren't the 

14 prison guards who were -- who were suable in 

Richardson -- weren't they suable under 1983 as acting 

16 under color of law? 

17  MS. MILLETT: This Court assumed that 

18 question; it did not answer it in that -- in that case. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the whole issue would 

have been a nonissue if they -- if they couldn't be 

21 sued. 

22  MS. MILLETT: This Court assumed it. I 

23 think it's fair to assume when you're operating a 

24 prison, although I think to -- there's a reason this 

Court reserved it, because the question there is --

1 certainly, the corporation --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

3  MS. MILLETT: -- was under color of law, 

4 whether the individuals who worked for the corporation 

would also be under color of law. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you think the -- the 

7 two should go pari passu, as we say, that if you can be 

8 sued for acting under color of law, you ought to have 

9 the defenses that people who are acting with legal 

authority have? 

11  MS. MILLETT: Well, this Court's already 

12 crossed that bridge in cases like Wyatt, where, for 

13 example -- and it does because the State law requirement 

14 can sweep broadly in some situations.

 So, I don't think in a situation like 

16 Wyatt v. Cole, where you have private plaintiffs 

17 pursuing their private agenda and they simply invoke a 

18 State law, that that makes them integrated with the 

19 government in the way that an attorney is, and certainly 

the way Petitioner was here, that they're not part of 

21 the governmental team, and they're not making -- they 

22 weren't making decisions in the interest of the 

23 government. There was no governmental decisionmaking to 

24 protect there, and that's what -- the rationale this 

Court gave for denying qualified immunity in Wyatt.

25

Official 

1  The key here is that this is -- you cannot 

2 protect governmental decisionmaking in this context 

3 without protecting the source of advice for that 

4 decisionmaking.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Lawyers are not 

6 supposed to be cowed by the exigencies of the situation. 

7 We're worried in qualified immunity with protecting 

8 governmental actors, to make sure they will feel 

9 comfortable doing the right thing rather than being 

intimidated in the situation we had here. 

11  Lawyers have that professional obligation in 

12 the first place. So, why does a lawyer need the -- the 

13 defense of qualified immunity? 

14  MS. MILLETT: There are a couple of reasons. 

First of all, that rationale would mean no government 

16 lawyers get the protection either, because they have 

17 that exact same obligation of fealty, and we don't apply 

18 that rule. That hasn't even been questioned. And the 

19 reason we don't is we understand that this is a more --

it's a more layered inquiry into timidity. 

21  First of all, we don't even want the 

22 subconscious pressures that would come with full-freight 

23 liability for governmental conduct to any angry third 

24 party even subconsciously interfering with the decisions 

of government lawyers temporarily or permanently 

15

1 retained. 

2  Secondly, we want the government to be able 

3 to get the advice, to be encouraged to get the advice. 

4 Section 1983 must support governments getting legal 

advice to counsel them in complying with the law that 

6 section 1983 enforces, but government will be deterred 

7 from obtaining legal advice if the cost of getting an 

8 attorney -- especially if you're a small town, 

9 municipality, county, you don't -- can't afford a 

full-time staff, and the cost of getting an attorney is 

11 all those things that qualified immunity wanted to 

12 protect against. 

13  Our decision -- reasonable decisionmaking 

14 that we thought was protected by qualified immunity is 

now on trial. And we have to be there as witnesses, and 

16 a jury is going to assess liability for a reasonable 

17 governmental decision. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Millett, our cases have 

19 said that we're supposed to look not only to policy but 

also to history. Would you disagree with the premise 

21 that a person in your client's position historically 

22 would have had at most an actual malice -- a malice 

23 defense or a reasonable cause defense? Would a person 

24 have anything more than that?

 MS. MILLETT: They would have had the same

25

Official 

1 sort of good-faith defense that this Court in Harlow 

2 turned into qualified immunity, both as lawyers 

3 working --

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, in Wyatt, we said that 

that was a very different kind of immunity than the 

6 Harlow immunity, and we said historically it provided no 

7 basis for giving Harlow immunity. 

8  MS. MILLETT: It -- it -- the Harlow 

9 immunity came from the same roots. Well, the -- what 

happened in Wyatt was we said we will turn that into 

11 protection for the government when we need to protect 

12 the special functioning of government. You had no 

13 need -- the Court had no need to do that in Wyatt 

14 because there was no governmental decisionmaking at 

stake there. 

16  But the -- the same type of defense -- this 

17 Court recognized in Richardson --

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, I take it that your 

19 answer is, yes, it would only have been a malice 

defense, but that doesn't matter, notwithstanding Wyatt. 

21  Is that your answer? 

22  MS. MILLETT: The -- the answer is that it 

23 is the same type of defense that this Court recognized 

24 in prior cases as supporting qualified immunity when 

needed to protect the decisions of the government. And

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: Doesn't that suggest really 

3 that we don't have a historical test anymore, that 

4 really all we're looking to is policy considerations?

 MS. MILLETT: Not this case at all, because 

6 you've got layers. You have layers of -- of history. 

7 You have the history recognized in Richardson for -- for 

8 lawyers who are working at the behest of the government, 

9 that specific history. You have the general history 

where -- where attorneys were provided a reasonable and 

11 good-faith, malice, and probable cause type of defense, 

12 which again is the type of -- the type of defense that 

13 gets turned into qualified immunity when needed to 

14 protect government's reasoned decisionmaking.

 If I could reserve the balance of my time.

1 and may it please the Court: 

2  Petitioner may assert qualified immunity on 

3 the same terms as the fire department officials because 

4 he was working side-by-side with them and under their 

supervision on a personnel investigation. And this is 

6 really exactly the situation that the Court reserved and 

7 anticipated in Richardson, that when you have a 

8 situation where private and government workers work 

9 closely together and you deny qualified immunity to the 

private person, it would directly affect the ability of 

11 the government employees to do their jobs. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if they don't 

13 work closely together at all and it's just this one 

14 fellow conducting the investigation, he wouldn't have 

qualified immunity? 

16  MS. SAHARSKY: No. This is a situation in 

17 which there's a very close working relationship --

19 he --

MS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- I'm wrong, or

Official 

1 our position that when people are doing the business of 

2 government, private people, can be sued under section 

3 1983 or Bivens, there should be a presumption in favor 

4 of qualified immunity.

 And Richardson is not to the contrary 

6 because that is a fairly unique case in which the 

7 private prison was so removed from the day-to-day 

8 workings of government officials that it would not have 

9 furthered the purposes of qualified immunity to give 

qualified immunity to the folks in those situations. 

11  So, what we're talking about, like --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's just hard to imagine 

13 anything more imbued with state action than imprisoning 

14 someone. That's -- that's the problem I have in 

thinking about the case. 

16  MS. SAHARSKY: Right. I mean, several 

17 members of the Court said that in Richardson. And 

18 the -- the Court's opinion really talked about the 

19 uniqueness of the situation there, that Tennessee was 

doing something really out on the forefront in terms of 

21 giving the day-to-day decisionmaking to the folks in 

22 that situation in the private prison, and only checking 

23 up. There was monitoring, you know, annually. It was 

24 really not much ongoing monitoring at all.

 And the -- the Richardson Court, you know,

1 found that to be a unique situation, but it 

2 distinguished the situation that you have here, where 

3 you have people --

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Wasn't Richardson really all 

about how market forces would make immunity unnecessary? 

6 And how is it that market forces play any different role 

7 in this case than they do in Richardson? 

8  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, we understand the 

9 Court's discussion of market forces to be really 

important in the context there, where you don't have 

11 individuals who are working closely with government. 

12  The Court needed -- and the purposes of 

13 qualified immunity wouldn't be served in terms of 

14 deterrence and in ensuring good government 

decisionmaking. But the market forces discussion was 

16 the Court reassuring itself in those circumstances that 

17 there would still be private prison companies that would 

18 be willing to take on the business of government and 

19 would be able to do it, you know, consistent with the 

Constitution. 

21  So, we don't understand the Court to have 

22 been setting out market forces as a test for qualified 

23 immunity, because, as your question seems to suggest, 

24 taken to its logical conclusion, any time a private 

person is being hired by the government, you could say,

2 else fill those shoes, et cetera, et cetera. So, we 

3 think the Court's market forces decision was -- was 

4 fairly confined to what the Court itself described as a 

unique situation in Richardson. And the Court --

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think market forces 

7 do operate differently here, or is it basically the same 

8 thing? 

9  MS. SAHARSKY: We do think that there's a 

difference in that the attorney in this situation has 

11 private clients that that attorney can work for, whereas 

12 the private prison company really could only work for 

13 the government. But --

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that in this 

case the -- the firm that the lawyer was associated with 

16 said its dominant business was giving advice to local 

17 government, local municipal government units. So --

18  MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. I mean, that was an 

19 important part of the firm's business, but Mr. Filarsky 

is trained as an employment lawyer and has, you know, 

21 broad training and expertise in employment-related 

22 matters. So, there's certainly other work that could be 

23 done. But, you know, we thought the core of the Court's 

24 decision in Richardson was really focusing on the 

purposes of qualified immunity and whether they would be

JUSTICE SCALIA: You seem to assume or to 

6 acknowledge or to concede that market forces do not 

7 operate for government employment, that all government 

8 employees are doing it out of love, that --

9  (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, why does market 

11 force eliminate this defense for somebody who's an 

12 employee of a private company but not for somebody who's 

13 an employee of the government? 

14  MS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia. I 

didn't mean to suggest that we thought that the market 

16 forces inquiry was particularly relevant to the -- to 

17 answering the qualified immunity question. I'm just 

18 explaining that the way we read the Court's opinion in 

19 Richardson, which obviously the members of this Court 

are the experts on, is that the Court was looking to 

21 market forces to reassure itself after it determined 

22 that the purposes of qualified immunity just wouldn't be 

23 served by giving an organization that was so far removed 

24 from the day-to-day workings of government the 

protection of qualified immunity. The Court just -- the

Official 

1 market forces really was just something unique to that 

2 case. 

3  And what we think is the most relevant is 

4 what the Court started with both in the decision in 

Wyatt and in Richardson, which is, is it necessary to 

6 give qualified immunity here to make sure there's 

7 principled and fearless government decisionmaking? It's 

8 the business of government that's important. And in 

9 this case, although Petitioner is an attorney who has 

his own fiduciary obligations, it is certainly the case 

11 that when he was threatened during the conduct of this 

12 personnel investigation, that that is something that 

13 potentially could chill his behavior. 

14  And to the extent that he cabins the advice 

that he gave to the fire department officials, that 

16 affects the ability of government to do their job. And 

17 I might give the Court --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that would be a 

19 breach of his duty as an attorney.

 MS. SAHARSKY: I'm saying --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And he would be subject 

22 to malpractice in that case. You -- seriously, I find 

23 this whole argument about market forces with respect to 

24 attorneys representing people odd because there's a 

whole slew of unemployed lawyers who will be happy to

1 take on any government service they can. 

2  So, going back to the -- that's -- what I 

3 consider the central argument you're making, which is: 

4 Will it chill advice? And I'm not sure how it can, 

given the independent fiduciary duty that an attorney 

6 has to zealously guard his or her client's interest. 

7  MS. SAHARSKY: I'm saying that an attorney 

8 is in a difficult position there, and it's the same 

9 position that a government attorney would be in, and the 

Court has extended qualified immunity to government 

11 attorneys who are in this position, either giving legal 

12 advice, like in the Burns case, or serving as 

13 prosecutors. And there's just no difference when he's 

14 operating in this case that would make him 

distinguishable from a government attorney. 

16  To answer another suggestion, I think, in 

17 your question, the Court talked about, in terms of 

18 deterrence and chilling, making sure that there were 

19 talented candidates who wanted to take on the position 

of government. So, the Court has never said, you know, 

21 we're concerned about wiping out the market entirely. 

22 It said, you know, if there is a segment of the market 

23 that will not take on this business anymore, that's a 

24 fairly serious problem when we need to make sure that 

the government of -- of business is done.

Official 

1  And if I can just make -- give the Court 

2 another example to, perhaps outside the context of this 

3 case, see how a private person being denied qualified 

4 immunity would affect government employees, consider a 

fire department that has some full-time fire department 

6 personnel and also some volunteer firefighters. When 

7 they're working together in fighting a fire, you don't 

8 want the volunteer firefighter thinking: Should I break 

9 down this door? I might face personal liability.

 You want him to make fearless decisions 

11 because whether he breaks down the door or not is going 

12 to directly affect the ability of the other folks who 

13 are trying to go into those homes, trying to stop the 

14 fire, to do their jobs.

 That would also be true in the context of 

16 court security. The United States Marshals Service 

17 sometimes uses private security guards, and we have 

18 direct supervision and control over them, but --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what -- what if 

it's a 100 percent purely volunteer fire department? I 

21 mean, the town, whatever, contracts, out-sources, 

22 whatever, but it's just run by volunteers. Is your 

23 answer the same? 

24  I'm trying to get at your point about 

they're working with or coordinating with government 

26

1 employees. And your argument seems a little derivative. 

2 You're saying the whole point is to protect the 

3 government employees, and you have to have qualified 

4 immunity for the non-employee to do that. But does your 

argument apply when there are no government employees 

6 around? 

7  MS. SAHARSKY: It's just difficult in the 

8 fire department situation, even if there is an 

9 all-volunteer force, that there wouldn't be some type of 

direct supervision by the mayor, by the city council, et 

11 cetera. You know, that's -- particularly in the local 

12 government situation, those folks would tend to work 

13 fairly closely together. 

14  It is, in the case of deterrence and wanting 

fearless decisionmaking, a primary concern that we have 

16 about protecting government. But we need to protect the 

17 individuals to protect government. So, we do need to 

18 make sure that their decisions aren't chilled, that 

19 persons like Petitioner are willing to take on 

representation of this kind. And the Ninth Circuit's 

21 suggestion that no private person should be -- should 

22 get qualified immunity, even when they're doing the 

23 day-to-day business of government, is just one that 

24 can't be reconciled with this Court's decisions in Wyatt 

and Richardson.

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's another part of 

2 qualified immunity, and I know it's not teed up in this 

3 case, but why is it reasoned decisionmaking to recognize 

4 you can't enter a home without a warrant, but you can 

tell the occupant to bring out every item you want to 

6 see? It seems to me that that's not -- that there --

7 there's clearly established law to say that's wrong. 

8  MS. SAHARSKY: Well, the Ninth Circuit found 

9 that it wasn't clearly established law. I understand 

that it's a fairly difficult Fourth Amendment question. 

11 But as you say, it wasn't teed up in this case. It 

12 wasn't -- there wasn't a petition on this question. It 

13 wasn't raised in the brief in opposition. You know, in 

14 light of the fact that the Ninth Circuit found it wasn't 

clearly established, it probably wouldn't make sense for 

16 the Court to address it. 

17  One thing I might point out along those 

18 lines is that both the district court made a finding, on 

19 page 49 of the Joint Appendix, and then the court of 

appeals made a finding in its opinion, and this was the 

21 reason that the court of appeals found it wasn't clearly 

22 established, was because there was no attendant threat 

23 in terms of employment consequences to Respondent in 

24 this case.

4 -- and in your view, is that a very simple question to 

answer? 

6  MS. SAHARSKY: In terms of the argument, 

7 Petitioner conceded throughout the litigation that he 

8 was a state actor. In the complaint, Respondent 

9 actually suggested he was an employee of the city. In 

terms of whether he was asserting the authority of State 

11 law, it does seem fairly clear that he was asserting the 

12 authority of State law here.

 Petitioner has not demonstrated a historical 

21 basis of immunity at common law for somebody in Mr.

23 shown that the immunity's purposes also serve Mr. 

24 Filarsky's situation here.

1 talk about that in a minute, but I want to address the 

2 issue that has been most -- discussed the most, which is 

3 the Petitioner's test. 

4  The test that the Petitioner proposes that 

this Court adopt is one that is very difficult to use. 

6 The test is simply whether the individual is temporarily 

7 retained in the -- in the functional equivalent of a 

8 government employee, considering three factors. The 

9 three factors are: one, the nature of the role 

performed; the close supervision and/or coordination 

11 with a government official --

12  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what about your test? 

13 What is your test? 

14  MR. MCGILL: Well, our test is Richardson. 

I think Richardson is the correct analysis. The Court 

16 starts with looking at a historical basis of an immunity 

17 at common law and then from there works to the policy 

18 reasons. 

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose you have a 

lawyer who's a part-time employee. Does that matter? 

21  MR. MCGILL: A part-time employee of a --

22  JUSTICE ALITO: A part-time employee of a 

23 government unit.

receive Harlow immunity.

2 difference, is between an employee and an independent 

3 contractor? 

4  MR. MCGILL: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And isn't that often a very 

6 difficult determination under the law? 

7  MR. MCGILL: No, I don't -- I don't think 

8 so. Any time -- like in Mr. Filarsky's situation, Mr. 

9 Filarsky is a for-profit law firm. You know, he sells 

himself as a -- as an experienced professional in the 

11 field providing legal services to the city --

12  JUSTICE ALITO: But there are a lot of --

13 there are a lot of -- I think -- well, there are a lot 

14 of law firms. I think all law firms other than public 

interest firms are for-profit firms, and the attorneys 

16 are part-time employees of municipalities and other 

17 government units to perform various functions, part-time 

18 judges, part-time prosecutors. 

19  MR. MCGILL: Well, the Court has made a 

distinction in its past decisions about functions that 

21 are integral to the judicial process. So, when you talk 

22 about a judge or a prosecutor, that's a -- that's a 

23 special function. That's sort of a different situation. 

24  But never has there been an immunity for an 

attorney just because they happen to be an attorney.

4  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, now you're talking 

about history. But I want to know how we are -- how the 

6 courts are to determine and why it should matter how a 

7 municipality sets this up. 

8  Suppose the town had hired Mr. Filarsky as a 

9 part-time town employee. So, he has a certain -- he has 

a 1-year contract or 6-month contract or something for a 

11 certain amount of money to perform services for a 

12 certain number of hours. You would say that he would be 

13 entitled to qualified immunity then. 

14  MR. MCGILL: No I would say that he would 

not be entitled to qualified immunity. 

16  JUSTICE ALITO: Why? 

17  MR. MCGILL: Because he's a --

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Because he's an employee. 

19 They pass a resolution saying he's an employee of the 

town. 

21  MR. MCGILL: Well, they passed a resolution 

22 to hire him and his firm to provide those services on a 

23 temporary basis or a basis of 6 months, but he still is 

24 an outside attorney, and he's probably got -- has other 

clients and has other interests involved. And the

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Year-long employment is not 

employment? If I accepted a government job for only a 

6 year, I'm not a government employee? I don't understand 

7 that. 

8  MR. MCGILL: Well, as I understood the 

9 hypothetical, if -- if that individual is -- is working 

as an employee of the city, then --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: He's working as an 

12 employee. He's hired for 1 year. It's a 1-year 

13 contract. Why -- why does that make him not an 

14 employee? Or is it the fact that he's a lawyer? And 

all lawyers have a certain independent responsibility. 

16 They can't do some things that government superiors 

17 might tell them to do, right? So, are you going to say 

18 all lawyers are -- are -- cannot plead qualified 

19 immunity?

 MR. MCGILL: Well, our position here in this 

21 case is that Mr. Filarsky was not necessarily acting in 

22 the role of an attorney. He was functioning as an 

23 internal affairs investigator. And it's doubtful that 

24 he would have maintained an attorney-client relationship

6  MR. MCGILL: But if he has other clients and 

7 he works for profit, then he operates in a different 

8 system. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. MCGILL: Then he's not subject to the

4 held personally liable.

 Now, can a lawyer give that advice? Yes. 

6 When he does, of course, he's subjecting himself to 

7 personal liability. Now, it's that conflict that is 

8 worrying me, among other things. 

9  So, what do we do about that? The lawyer is 

being asked to give advice to the client. Under the 

11 canons of ethics, he ought to have their interest at 

12 heart, and in doing that, he's subjecting himself to 

13 what could be hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars 

14 worth of damages or whatever in suits for malpractice. 

Is there a way that we side with you out of that 

16 dilemma? 

17  MR. MCGILL: I don't think that that's 

18 necessarily an immunity question; it's more of a 

19 liability question because it very well may be that --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. What I'm 

21 assuming in the question is, since it's a close 

22 question, he has to worry about a court saying: You 

23 were wrong in saying it was legal. It was not legal. 

24 The matter was unclear, but it was not legal.

 At that point, he becomes subject to much

1 damages. But, of course, the others do not, and he had 

2 to tell them go ahead with it. You understand my point. 

3  MR. MCGILL: I do. 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: So, what is the answer?

 MR. MCGILL: But -- but I think what -- what 

6 it is -- the difference there is that there you have an 

7 attorney just providing advice, which is different than 

8 what happened here, where you actually had the attorney 

9 engaged --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that may be, but what 

11 I'm trying to work out is what is your set of rules? If 

12 we don't say -- if we don't say you have immunity, and 

13 you agree that this is a bad dilemma at least in my 

14 hypothetical case, I'm trying to work out what set of 

rules you advocate in order to either say, well, that's 

16 too bad, the dilemma is there, we can't get around it, 

17 or something else. That's why I want your answer. 

18  MR. MCGILL: If the attorney under those 

19 circumstances could be held liable for a constitutional 

violation for simply giving advice and he happens to be 

21 a private attorney working for profit, then he wouldn't 

22 have immunity. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: I change it slightly, and 

24 he puts them up to it.

 MR. MCGILL: Well --

2 couldn't. I mean, you know, he says go do it. Or, in 

3 other words, my hypothetical -- okay, go ahead. 

4  MR. MCGILL: I think the answer's the same. 

If somehow under those circumstances the attorney could 

6 be held liable for giving that advice, and he's -- he's 

7 a private attorney, and he doesn't pass the Richardson 

8 test, then he would not be entitled to immunity. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your case --

MR. MCGILL: So, there's no -- there's no --

11 I'm sorry. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, you can finish 

13 your answer. 

14  MR. MCGILL: There's certainly no -- there 

is no historical basis of immunity just for giving legal 

16 advice. The Petitioner hasn't pointed this Court to any 

17 firmly rooted tradition of an immunity. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your case 

19 highlights -- I think is a very good example of why the 

lawyer ought to have qualified immunity. I mean, this 

21 was a case where it looks like there's a lot of 

22 threatening and bullying going on. I mean, the -- the 

23 lawyer says -- you know, we're going to figure out a way 

24 to name you, Mr. Filarsky. You're issuing an illegal 

order. If you want to take that chance go right ahead.

1 You might want to think -- take a minute to think about 

2 it. 

3  I mean, it seems exactly the kind of 

4 situation for which qualified immunity was -- was 

developed. We want Filarsky to give what he -- do what 

6 he thinks is the right thing in this situation. We 

7 don't want him to be worried about the fact that he 

8 might be sued. And you have a lawyer here saying, well, 

9 if you do that, I'm going to sue you. So, Filarsky 

naturally, or some lawyer in that situation, is going to 

11 think, wow, do I really want to run that risk? 

12  Isn't that exactly why we have qualified 

13 immunity? 

14  MR. MCGILL: No. And the reason for that is 

that because Mr. Filarsky is a private individual, he 

16 doesn't need qualified immunity. You know, Richardson 

17 is decided in 1997, but in 2003, the Ninth Circuit 

18 issued its decision in Gonzalez v. Spencer. And in 

19 Gonzalez v. Spencer, the court held that private 

attorneys like Mr. Filarsky don't need immunity; they 

21 don't get immunity. So, the law in the land since 

22 2003 --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's easy 

24 for a judge to say because they're absolutely immune, 

but for the lawyer who is sitting there and saying --

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- saying I'm going 

3 to sue you, if you were -- well, you are a lawyer. And 

4 you're sitting in that situation. Isn't that going to 

enter into your mind? You say, well, sue all you want; 

6 I don't care; this is the right answer. 

7  MR. MCGILL: But, for nearly a decade, the 

8 law within the Ninth Circuit has been that private 

9 attorneys don't receive immunity.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

11  MR. MCGILL: And that -- the fact that is, 

12 is that Mr. Filarsky knew going into that -- that 

13 investigation that he wouldn't have immunity for 

14 anything he -- he did. And it didn't deter him; it 

didn't make him --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do you 

17 know? 

18  MR. MCGILL: Well, because he -- in the 

19 light of the threats that he received, he still went 

forward with the -- what was deemed to be an 

21 unconstitutional search. So, the policy purposes of, 

22 you know, wanting to prevent unwarranted timidity and 

23 deterring talented candidates from working for the 

24 government --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he had -- he

2  MR. MCGILL: Well, the --

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then the chief 

4 later on says, well, he told me to issue the order. I 

mean, I'm not quite sure that things went exactly as 

6 they would if you had qualified immunity. 

7  MR. MCGILL: Well, Mr. Filarsky said -- and 

8 this is what he said on the record; it's in the 

9 transcripts in the Joint Appendix -- is that he's 

issuing the order on behalf of the department. That's 

11 what he said. And then there was some -- some 

12 discussion back and forth between Mr. Delia's attorney 

13 and Mr. Filarsky, and that's what led to the 

14 formalization of -- of the order.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I understand that 

16 there is a lot of bad, cowardly legal advice being given 

17 in the Ninth Circuit. 

18  (Laughter.) 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't really know that, 

but you don't know the opposite, either, do you? 

21  MR. MCGILL: I don't. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't you 

23 cross-appeal on the clearly established law? Because 

24 then -- then you could concede, so, arguendo, he had 

qualified immunity, but the advice that he gave was

2  MR. MCGILL: So, why did the Petitioner --

3 or the Respondent not cross-appeal? 

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't you bring up 

that -- that issue? 

6  MR. MCGILL: I think it was -- that's sort 

7 of the law of the case, is that the Ninth Circuit found 

8 that there was a constitutional violation. So, we 

9 obviously didn't want to appeal that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, but -- but whether it 

11 was clearly established. In other words, what we had 

12 here was a recognition: We can't go into the house; we 

13 can't go into a house, private house, without a warrant. 

14 So -- in fact, Filarsky said something about I know a 

way -- a way to get around that; we just tell them to 

16 bring out the items. 

17  MR. MCGILL: Right. I -- my personal 

18 opinion and our position has been is that it -- the law 

19 was clearly established on that. Why the decision was 

made not to cross-appeal on that, I'm not -- I'm not 

21 sure. But --

22  JUSTICE ALITO: Are you saying it's clearly 

23 established that there isn't a difference between going 

24 in and looking for the insulation, et cetera, and

known that the house is --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, 

7 particularly --

8  MR. MCGILL: -- is --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, even as -- the 

reason it's an issue is because he says, look, I've got 

11 this stuff at my house. That's how his -- his defense 

12 is. I haven't used it; I've got the insulation there. 

13 So, you think it's still clearly established that it 

14 violates the Fourth Amendment for the city to say, okay, 

well, show it to us if you want to use that as your 

16 defense? 

17  MR. MCGILL: Yes, I do because it -- it --

18 certainly, Mr. Filarsky didn't have any reasonable 

19 suspicion to believe that Mr. Delia was lying or was 

being dishonest. He certainly didn't have probable 

21 cause. He had a hunch. And then that's what he said, 

22 I -- I -- he said it as -- at the -- during the 

23 interview that I -- I don't necessarily know that you're 

24 lying; I just -- I want to see if you are.

 I think that would be a different situation 

6 if perhaps you could argue that they had a reasonable 

7 suspicion or had some cause to search his house, but 

8 here they didn't. So, I think it is under those facts 

9 clearly established.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. McGill, back to 

11 immunity, what -- one thing I don't understand about our 

12 law here, you say there was no historic basis. And I 

13 have to concede that that's right. Seems to me that 

14 there's -- there was only a malice defense. But isn't 

that always true when it comes to a -- a private person? 

16 In other words, of course there's no historic basis for 

17 qualified immunity. This kind of immunity was developed 

18 in 1970. It's sort of by definition there's no historic 

19 basis for this sort of immunity.

 So, to say that the historic basis matters 

21 is really to say that private people never get Harlow 

22 immunity. 

23  MR. MCGILL: Well, I think that that's 

24 right. There was not qualified immunity at common law, 

but there was absolute immunity. And in -- there -- I 

47

25

Official 

1 mean, I can't go back and think about all the different 

2 immunities that may or may not have existed, but I -- I 

3 do know that the Petitioner has the burden to bring 

4 forth a firmly rooted tradition. This Court has said 

over and over that it's not going to create new 

6 immunities. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: But the Court's cases are a 

8 mix of history and -- and policy. The Court has 

9 recognized both absolute immunity -- has recognized 

absolute immunity in instances where there wasn't 

11 absolute immunity at common law; isn't that true? 

12  MR. MCGILL: Right. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and the rule about 

14 malice being -- being the criterion of liability, that 

applied not just to -- not just to private lawyers but 

16 to government lawyers as well, didn't it? 

17  MR. MCGILL: It did. That that -- that that 

18 good-faith defense applied --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, if we're going to be 

historically faithful, we should deny any qualified 

21 immunity to government lawyers or expand the government 

22 immunity to -- for government lawyers so they can do 

23 anything so long as it's not malicious? 

24  MR. MCGILL: Well, that -- that's what this 

Court would have to do.

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. MCGILL: -- a defense. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, the devil with history, 

7 right? 

8  MR. MCGILL: Well, it would result in this 

9 Court having to expand that immunity that it expanded in 

Harlow to private individuals. And our position is that 

11 because a private individual like Mr. Filarsky is a 

12 market participant, the purposes of immunity aren't 

13 served. They just simply aren't needed. And I was 

14 mentioning earlier about --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- what about 

16 the argument that Filarsky makes, that if there were to 

17 be a proceeding against him, inevitably the witnesses 

18 would be the government employees? They would be the 

19 battalion chiefs, the fire chief. So, one of the 

reasons for the qualified immunity is you don't want to 

21 disturb government employees in the routine performance 

22 of their work. Certainly, in this case, there would be 

23 disruption, distraction of these government employees. 

24  MR. MCGILL: Well, there probably would be 

some distraction. That would be inevitable, but it 

49
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 would be no different than the distraction that the 

2 government would face when a private attorney is sued 

3 for any number of claims, malpractice or, you know, some 

4 State law violation.

 And to say that the -- the distraction that 

6 the government is going to face based on just what is 

7 probably a small sliver of the big pie, which is, you 

8 know, 1983 litigation, is pretty speculative. And, of 

9 course, it doesn't answer the question that the -- the 

government employer itself can still be liable under 

11 Monell. 

12  So, even though the immunity may kick in and 

13 the individuals may get off or may not have to stand 

14 suit, it -- there are still occasions when the 

government is still going to be there. So, that 

16 distraction is still going to exist. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if Filarsky was 

18 there, you know, hired to help the fire department with 

19 these -- and he did absolutely nothing? He just sits 

there and watches. The battalion chief says, I want to 

21 do this; I'm going to go get the stuff; you bring it all 

22 out. And he just -- he just sits there, doesn't see any 

23 reason to offer any legal advice or opinion. Could you 

24 still sue him under 1983?

 MR. MCGILL: Well, I don't think he would be 

50

1 liable, but I don't think under that situation, he would 

2 have participated in the --

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Really? He has an 

4 obligation as a lawyer to speak up if he thinks 

something illegal is going on. That's his job. And he 

6 doesn't -- he just sits there quietly? 

7  MR. MCGILL: No. I don't know that -- that 

8 he would be liable under section 1983. But if he were, 

9 and he were a private lawyer, he would not have 

qualified immunity. He would still be under the same 

11 Richardson test where there's no historical basis for 

12 it, and because he's the private individual working 

13 under -- you know, working for profit and subject to 

14 market pressures, he wouldn't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if he -- this 

16 for profits -- I -- the significance of that eludes me. 

17 Sometimes people act out of, you know, public service, 

18 and particularly in these sorts of situations, the town 

19 needs a lawyer, and he's helping out. What -- if he 

were purely a volunteer, it would be a different answer? 

21  MR. MCGILL: If he were purely a volunteer, 

22 it very well might be a different answer because some of 

23 those policy concerns that -- that Richardson talked 

24 about and discussed may not be present. So, you have to 

apply the test to the situation you have before you. 

51

Official 

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And, well -- and 

2 what if he gives the city a discount? He's working for 

3 half -- half his fee because it's the city. He wants to 

4 help out, but he can't do it totally for free. So, it's 

50 percent his normal rate. 

6  MR. MCGILL: I don't know that 50 percent 

7 makes a difference. And earlier, we were discussing 

8 that -- the 1-year or the 2-year and so forth, the 

9 length of the contract. I don't think that those things 

necessarily make a difference. The point is whether Mr. 

11 Filarsky was undertaking that representation or that 

12 role in a manner that made him subject to other regular 

13 market pressures. 

14  If he was performing a function and 

competing against other lawyers or other investigators 

16 performing that same function, then the point is there, 

17 you know, he isn't going to be as timid because he's 

18 going to want to do a good job. And the same policy 

19 concerns that are present for that government lawyer 

aren't there for him as a private individual. 

21  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose a municipality 

22 were to -- or a State were to abolish all the civil 

23 service rules and all the special rules and go back to 

24 employment at will for government employees. Would that 

-- would that take with it the whole qualified immunity

1 regime? 

2  MR. MCGILL: I don't think that it would. 

3 In other words, is the question whether or not, if we 

4 abolished the merit system or civil service system, 

would qualified immunity still be needed? 

6  I think if that were the question, that --

7 well, that's a tough question to answer. But it very 

8 well may not be because, you know, part of the decision 

9 in Richardson here was -- it was -- they are operating 

within a different system. Private versus public. And 

11 if you start to make the public system look more like a 

12 private system, then it very well may be that immunity 

13 won't be needed at all. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: It seems strange because the 

immunities, at least some of the immunities, long 

16 pre-date the -- the institution of the civil service 

17 system. Everybody is subject to market forces. Every 

18 person who works is influenced by market forces to some 

19 degree; isn't that correct?

 MR. MCGILL: I think that that's correct, 

21 but when you have a civil service system, a merit 

22 system, it's -- it is not as easy to correct behavior as 

23 it would be for, say, a private person. For, like, Mr. 

24 Filarsky, if he was not performing at -- at the level 

that the City of Rialto had hoped, he can be replaced

2  For a government employee, though, there are 

3 obviously the civil service protections, and it's not so 

4 easy to do that. So, that's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not true of most 

6 lawyers. 

7  MR. MCGILL: Pardon me. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Most lawyers are not 

9 part of the civil service -- internal lawyers are not 

part of the civil service system. They're generally 

11 considered employees at will, at least most of the 

12 circuit courts have so held. 

13  MR. MCGILL: I'm not familiar with 

14 whether --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That they're 

16 policymakers and, as such, are not subject to civil 

17 service protections. 

18  MR. MCGILL: Well, I -- I know that some 

19 subsections of lawyers within a government can be 

represented. So, they very well may have some 

21 protection, but maybe it's not quite to the extent that 

22 more of the rank and file would have. 

23  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the political 

24 appointees within the United States Department of 

Justice are not protected by civil service. So, should

6 forces, aren't they? 

7  MR. MCGILL: They very well may be, and it 

8 may be for me to say that maybe they shouldn't have an 

9 immunity or it's not needed. But at this point, the law 

is, under Harlow, that they would receive it. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: What if I told you that all 

12 the lawyers at the Department of Justice are regarded as 

13 being employed at will and that all of them can be 

14 fired?

 MR. MCGILL: Well, I --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think the rest of 

17 them don't -- don't have any protection? 

18  MR. MCGILL: I think that the answer would 

19 be the same in that they very well may not need 

qualified immunity because those pressures and those 

21 concerns underlying immunity aren't there. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Wow. That's going to be 

23 disappointing news for all those attorneys at Justice --

 MR. MCGILL: I just want to go back and talk

20

25

Official 

1 about the Petitioner's test a little bit, too, because 

2 the Court had some concerns about it. And I share those 

3 same concerns, and that's that the test requires a 

4 factual analysis, you know, being temporarily retained 

in close coordination and supervision. Those are highly 

6 factual questions that aren't going to bode well for 

7 early resolution of a case. 

8  And a -- the lawyer is going to be able to 

9 plead around that test very easily and take the case 

into -- into full-blown litigation and discovery and so 

11 forth. So, that -- that test is problematic. 

12  In addition, as I understand it, the test is 

13 going to be extended well beyond attorneys. The test 

14 results in anybody working for the government under, you 

know, close coordination or supervision, whatever that 

16 means, is going to get immunity. So, that is well 

17 beyond attorneys, to anybody. Anybody who contracts 

18 with the government and meets that factual test is now 

19 going to have immunity.

 And that's something -- that's a huge step 

21 that this Court, you know, should not take, especially 

22 when there is no historical basis for it and the policy 

23 concerns are not present. 

24  But even if you apply that test to 

Mr. Filarsky, under these facts, Mr. Filarsky would not

2 worked for the City of Rialto for 14 years as -- as a 

3 business, for profit. He had many clients, and the City 

4 of Rialto was one of them. It wasn't that he was 

temporarily retained. So, he doesn't even meet that 

6 element of the Petitioner's test. 

7  Mr. Filarsky was not performing a --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are all of these --

9 are all of these objections applicable as well to the 

determination of whether there is state action from the 

11 attorney's conduct?

13 a factual --

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MR. MCGILL: -- inquiry? 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 

17  MR. MCGILL: I don't think so. I mean, as 

18 an attorney, I would have to certify in a pleading that 

19 -- the relationship between the person I'm suing and the 

government. So, I think that there would have to be 

21 information put forth in the pleading that would 

22 establish that, and I don't know that one could simply 

23 make up state action for purposes of pursuing a 1983 

24 action.

 So, it -- it may be that there's a factual

2 great as -- as the temporarily retained or close 

3 coordination components to the -- or the Petitioner's 

4 test.

 Mr. Filarsky was not performing a function 

6 that is uniquely governmental. Investigating workplace 

7 misconduct is not a governmental function, or it's not a 

8 prototypical governmental function. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your -- your 

objection is not that he was investigating workplace 

11 conduct; your objection is that he was ordering people 

12 to tell your client to bring out stuff that was in his 

13 house. 

14  MR. MCGILL: Correct. But it was under the 

-- the auspices of a -- a workplace investigation, if 

16 you will. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but telling 

18 people basically either executing a search or in effect 

19 executing a search, that is a uniquely governmental 

function. 

21  MR. MCGILL: Executing a -- a formal search 

22 by the government is something -- that's a role that the 

23 government performs, but I wouldn't say that -- I 

24 wouldn't equate, you know, executing a search with what 

occurred here.

1  Well, let me -- let me restate that, I 

2 guess. What I mean to say is that --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want to say that. 

4  (Laughter.)

 MR. MCGILL: Mr. Filarsky -- the function, 

6 the role that he was performing was that of an internal 

7 affairs investigator. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but if -- if he did 

9 the same thing for a private company -- he could do the 

same thing for a private company, say, you know, you're 

11 going to get fired unless you substantiate your story by 

12 bringing the stuff out of your house. That wouldn't be 

13 a search -- an unlawful search; right? It could have 

14 happened in a private company.

 MR. MCGILL: It could, and --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

17  MR. MCGILL: Yes, it very well could have. 

18 And that's my point, is that what Mr. Filarsky did in 

19 his role was not uniquely governmental. He wasn't 

performing that governmental function. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there's very little 

22 that is uniquely governmental. I mean, my goodness, if 

23 we denied immunity to -- to all those acts that are not 

24 uniquely governmental, there would be very little 

immunity, I'm afraid.

1  MR. MCGILL: Thank you. 

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

3  Ms. Millett, you have 3 minutes remaining. 

4  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

6  MS. MILLETT: Thank you. 

7  Justice Breyer, your dilemma is -- sits at 

8 the crux of why qualified immunity is appropriate here 

9 because not only do you have the lawyer saying, well, 

you'll be all okay, but I'm going to be going down in 

11 this lawsuit; the lawyer's going to have a duty to 

12 inform his client that, in fact, this will lead to 

13 litigation. You will be protected in your personal 

14 capacity, but guess what, litigation is going to ensue.

 That can influence and deter both lawyers' 

16 willingness to work for the government at these cut 

17 rates or pro bono rates, their -- subconsciously, the 

18 advice they give, and it can make the government not 

19 want to act on the advice, which is precisely what we 

want to protect. 

21  Nothing like that was happening in 

22 Richardson. The government was nowhere on the scene 

23 when the constitutional decisions being challenged --

24 they weren't even percipient witnesses in that 

situation.

1  The second point I want to make is fiduciary 

2 duty doesn't change it other than it confirms that he's 

3 working in the interest of the government, but every 

4 agent has a fiduciary duty to their principal. And so, 

you can't deny qualified immunity on that ground or 

6 you'll have a sweeping decision on your hands. 

7  The market concerns, Justice Sotomayor --

8 the test is not whether a warm body could be found to 

9 fulfill this operation if he won't do it. This is a 

completely different market from Richardson, where 

11 there's only one client for prisons, and that's the 

12 government. 

13  Here, the government is competing for the 

14 services. When it needs a skilled attorney, when it 

wants people of the caliber that the government service 

16 needs and deserves, it is competing. And right now, as 

17 the Chief Justice recognized, a lot of times, including 

18 for Mr. Filarsky, that's done at discount rates. 

19  These folks -- this is already a marginal 

decision. And if you want to talk about market 

21 decisions, then you're going to push that weight. And 

22 if the answer is, if you decide to take on this pro bono 

23 representation or cut your rates out of public duty and 

24 -- and a willingness to serve your government, guess 

what comes with it: You alone will be left holding the

2  Section 1983 is supposed to deter 

3 governmental conduct. It is not supposed to deter the
