 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Court will hear 

argument first today in case 06-278, Morse vs. 

Frederick. 

Mr. Starr.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. STARR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Illegal drugs and the glorification of the 

drug culture are profoundly serious problems for our 

nation. Congress has so recognized, as has this Court, 

time and again. The magnitude of the problem is 

captured in the amicus brief, the Court has a number of 

amicus briefs before it, but the amicus brief of General 

McCaffrey, Secretary Bennett, and a number of 

organizations. And particularly, pages 5 to 9 of that 

brief, the nature and the scope of the problem are 

well-captured.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is this case limited 

to signs about drugs? What is the rule that you want us 

to adopt for deciding this case?

 MR. STARR: The rule the Court -- that it 

articulated in Tinker. The rule of the Court as

articulated in Tinker is that there is, in fact, a right 

to political speech subject to disruption, requirements 

that the speech not be disruptive.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Disruptive of what? 

Disruptive of the classroom order? There was no 

classroom here.

 MR. STARR: Including but not limited to. 

This was a school authorized event, this was education 

outside of the classroom. It was essentially a school 

simply out of doors. It was essentially --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I can understand if 

they unfurled the banner in a classroom that it would be 

disruptive, but what did it disrupt on the sidewalk?

 MR. STARR: The educational mission of the 

school.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I mean, that's at a 

level of generality that doesn't get us very far. I 

mean, what specifically did it disrupt? Did it disrupt 

the parade, did it disrupt teaching, what was it?

 MR. STARR: 5520, a school policy of the 

board that says emphatically that political speech is 

protected, embracing Tinker.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then if that's the rule, 

the school can make any rule that it wants on any 

subject restrictive of speech, and if anyone violates

it, the result is, on your reasoning, it's disruptive 

under Tinker.

 MR. STARR: Not at all. I think that in 

form --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then I'm missing the 

argument.

 MR. STARR: The argument is that this Court 

in Tinker articulated a rule that allows the school 

boards considerable discretion both in identifying the 

educational mission and to prevent disruption of that 

mission, and this is disruptive of the mission --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose you have --

suppose you have a mission to have a global school. Can 

they ban American flags on lapel pins?

 MR. STARR: Absolutely not, because under 

Tinker that is political expression. Let me be very 

specific. This case is ultimately about drugs and other 

illegal substances.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if the sign had been 

"Bong Stinks for Jesus," that would be, and Morse had 

the same reaction, that this was demeaning to the 

Olympics and it was unruly conduct, that there would be 

a protected right under Tinker because the message was 

not promoting drugs?

 MR. STARR: She stated in her answers to

interrogatories that she may very well not have 

interfered with the banner had it in fact said legalize 

marijuana. Under our theory, we think she could have 

interfered with that because it was disruptive to the 

event, it was disorderly to the event itself, but the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What would be disorderly? 

I don't understand this disorder.  If somebody holds up 

a sign and says change the marijuana laws, why is it 

disruptive of anything, simply because the school quite 

naturally has said we support the enforcement of the 

law, and the law right now does forbid the use of 

marijuana.

 MR. STARR: I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It's political speech, it 

seems to me. I don't see what it disrupts, unless 

disruption simply means any statement of disagreement 

with a position officially adopted by the school. Is 

that what you mean by disruption?

 MR. STARR: No. Your Honor, first of all, 

this is, I think, an unusual characterization, namely 

for this to be called political speech. We would --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If it's calling -- I mean 

MR. STARR: We think it's a First -- I'm 

sorry.

JUSTICE SOUTER: A call for a change in the 

law, I would have supposed, was political speech.

 MR. STARR: That wasn't the interpretation. 

Your Honor, let's back up, if I may. Someone has to 

interpret the message and the front line message 

interpreter is the school official. The school official 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be, but 

that's not the hypo. The -- the hypothetical is, what 

if there is a sign or a statement in the school calling 

for a change in, you know, the prohibition against 

marijuana use? As a call for change in the law, I would 

suppose it was political speech. But as I understood 

the argument you were making, it would still be regarded 

as an exception, as it were, to Tinker, because it was 

disruptive. And it was disruptive in the sense that it 

disagreed with official school policy, which was to 

enforce the law or support the law as it was. Is that 

your position on what disruption means under Tinker?

 MR. STARR: But our -- the answer is no. 

Because what we are also urging the Court to consider is 

its gloss on Tinker and Frazier, and also what this 

Court said in Kuhlmeier. And in Frazier, the Court was 

very clear, the first three paragraphs in part three of 

the opinion, in talking about the habits and manners of

civility, and inculcating the values of citizenship. 

That, in fact, is what is happening here. There is an 

effort of the -- to prevent a message that is 

inconsistent with a fundamental message of the schools, 

which is the use of illegal drugs is simply verboten, 

and we believe that is permitted under Tinker --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you want to get away 

from a hypothetical then. I don't know why you try to 

defend a hypothetical that involves a banner that says 

amend the marijuana laws. That's not this case as you 

see it, is it?

 MR. STARR: Well, it's certainly not this 

case, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This banner was interpreted 

as meaning smoke pot, no?

 MR. STARR: It was interpreted -- exactly, 

yes. It was interpreted as an encouragement of the drug 

culture and --

JUSTICE ALITO: Are you arguing that there 

should be a sui generis rule for speech that advocates 

illegal drug use, or this broader argument that the 

school can suppress any speech that is inconsistent with 

its educational mission as the school --

MR. STARR: I think that --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- defines it?

MR. STARR: I apologize. The Court can 

certainly decide this on very narrow grounds, that there 

are certain substances, illegal drugs, we would include 

alcohol and tobacco, that's part of the school's policy, 

because those are illegal substances which are very 

injurious to health. And this Court has noted that in 

Bernonia and in Earls, time and again, it is that these 

are very dangerous substances and we have a clear policy 

sanctioned by Congress, and also noted by courts across 

the country, that illegal drugs are so dangerous that 

schools are entitled to have a message going --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the problem --

the problem, Mr. Starr, is that school boards these days 

take it upon themselves to broaden their mission well 

beyond education or protection from illegal substances, 

and several of the briefs have pointed out school boards 

have adopted policies taking on the whole range of 

political issues. Now, do they get to dictate the 

content of speech on all of those issues simply because 

they have adopted that as the part of their educational 

mission?

 MR. STARR: No, because that may very well 

be inconsistent with Tinker. Tinker articulates a 

baseline of political speech is, in fact, protected, 

subject to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think that 

-- I think you're right about that, and I guess my 

question goes to how broadly we should read Tinker. I 

mean, why is it that the classroom ought to be a forum 

for political debate simply because the students want to 

put that on their agenda? Presumably the teacher's 

agenda is a little bit different and includes things 

like teaching Shakespeare or the Pythagorean Theorem, 

and just because political speech is on the student's 

agenda, I'm not sure that it makes sense to read Tinker 

so broadly as to include protection of those, that 

speech.

 MR. STARR: This Court has not read Tinker 

quite so broadly in both Frazier and in Kuhlmeier, and 

there are a couple of aspects of Tinker that I think are 

worthy of note. One, that there was no written policy 

there, so there was an issue of standardless discretion 

being exercised. And also --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it may have made a 

difference in Tinker. If the school had a policy, 

defend our troops in Vietnam, would that have brought 

this into the category that you are now carving out? 

You said that Tinker had no policy, but suppose the 

school did have a policy, patriotism, we support our 

troops, no bad speech about the war in Vietnam. Should

Tinker have come out the other way?

 MR. STARR: No, it should not, because there 

-- I think there are concerns with respect to what this 

Court has identified it is trying to, even in the public 

school setting, quite apart from the university setting, 

to cast a pall of orthodoxy to prevent the discussion of 

ideas. What is happening here of course in this case, 

it can be decided very narrowly, that drugs, alcohol and 

tobacco just have no place in the schools. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but the rule you 

proposed, I thought, in response to my question is that 

the school has wide discretion to define its educational 

mission and it can restrict speech that's inconsistent 

with that mission.

 MR. STARR: And that's what this Court in --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me that's 

much broader than Tinker. Now you said, well, there is 

an exception for political speech. Well, but then 

you're right with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, let's 

suppose that they have a particular view on a political 

issue, No Child Left Behind, or foreign intervention and 

so forth.

 MR. STARR: Justice Kennedy, the words that 

you articulated are essentially quotes of Frazier and 

Kuhlmeier, so there is a broadening of the lens and a

restoration, frankly, of greater school discretion in 

those two cases than one might see in Tinker. They of 

course drew, as you well know, from Justice Black's 

warning in dissent of Tinker that the Federal courts, 

Federal judiciary should not be extending itself unduly 

into the work of the school boards' --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do we have to get into 

the question of what the school board's policy is and 

what things they can make its policy? Surely it can be 

the -- it must be the policy of any school to discourage 

breaking of the law. I mean, suppose this banner had 

said kill somebody, and there was no explicit regulation 

of the school that said you should not, you should not 

foster murder. Wouldn't that be suppressible?

 MR. STARR: Of course. That is not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course it would, so --

MR. STARR: The answer is yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why can't we decide this 

case on that narrow enough ground, that any school 

whether it has expressed the policy or not, can suppress 

speech that advocates violation of the law?

 MR. STARR: I think it can, but it raises 

some interesting potential hypothetical questions, what 

about listening to the voice of Martin Luther King 

Junior, conscientious objection and so forth. I don't

think the Court needs to stray into those areas because 

here we have a written policy which does in fact respond 

to concerns about the exercise of standardless 

discretion.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it have --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just clear up one 

thing to be 100 percent sure I understand your position. 

It does -- the message is the critical part of this 

case. If it was a totally neutral message on a 15-foot 

sign, that would be okay. You're not saying 15-foot 

signs are disruptive?

 MR. STARR: Not inherently disruptive, but 

in fact -- the answer is yes. We're not saying that

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And so we're focusing on 

the message and that's the whole crux of the case.

 MR. STARR: That's why this case is here 

because of the message.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why is that? Why? 

Why? I mean suppose you go on a school trip, and the 

teacher says on the school trip, I don't want people 

unfurling 15 foot banners. I don't care what they are 

about.

 MR. STARR: It may very well be.

 JUSTICE BREYER: We are going to visit the 

state capital and we are not marching down the street

with 15 foot banners. I mean, does the First Amendment 

say the teacher can't say that?

 MR. STARR: It does not. But the Juneau 

school board and 5520, Justice Breyer, allows -- in fact 

it has a Tinker statement in the first paragraph of 

5520, which is also, you will not be advocating drugs. 

And so there is essentially a culture of liberty in 

Juneau. You don't have to --

JUSTICE BREYER: You just said suppose --

why should I not say that? I mean I'm not going to do 

it, necessarily. But why could I not say, would it be 

wrong in an opinion to say a school board can on a 

school trip tell the students they can't unfurl 15 foot 

banners? Is that a correct statement of the law or not? 

In your opinion.

 MR. STARR: In my opinion it is a correct 

statement of the law. But in response to Justice 

Stevens' question, the message here is in fact critical 

because what we know about this case is that, and you're 

here of course to respond to this case, which has to do 

with a message that the message interpreter, Deborah 

Morse, who by the way --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's also critical here to 

your case that it was a school event. If it, if this 

had have been two blocks down the street there would

have been no objection.

 MR. STARR: If Mr. Frederick had seen fit to 

go down Glacier Avenue to J and J's, a popular hangout, 

there would have been no high school jurisdiction. 

There may have been elementary school -- but yes. He 

could have gone, Justice Stevens, to the State capital 

or anywhere along the ten mile route.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose it were Saturday 

instead of a weekday.

 MR. STARR: I beg your pardon.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose it were Saturday, 

not a school day. And the school children were not 

required to show up at the Olympic event but were 

encouraged to and the same thing happened. Would it 

make a difference that it wasn't in the course of a 

regular school day?

 MR. STARR: No. I think it still, under 

your hypothetical would be school sponsored. But there 

might be a more difficult showing of disruption or 

inconsistency with the educational mission. That is 

what this Court articulated in Frazier and again in 

Kuhlmeier that the school is able under our policies of 

federalism and value of federalism and democratic theory 

to fashion its educational mission subject to 

constitutional safeguards. And that mission of

preventing the schools from being infected with pro-drug 

messages continues wherever there is school 

jurisdiction, and that would include on a Saturday field 

trip or other kind of activity and I think that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Starr, you -- you 

responded to Justice Breyer that you think the school 

could just prohibit the unfurling of 15 foot banners on 

a trip.  Could it prohibit the wearing of black armbands 

on a trip?

 MR. STARR: I don't believe so.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And if not -- if not, 

what's the difference?

 MR. STARR: Because of the potential for 

disruption, disorderliness in the event and the judgment 

that is entrusted to --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But don't we have to be 

more specific about the context in determining whether 

there's disruption? If it's a school trip to an art 

museum, unfurling a 15 foot banner in front of the 

pictures is clearly going to be disruptive of the object 

of the trip. Unfurling a banner in a classroom is going 

to be disruptive to the teaching of Shakespeare or 

whatever is supposed to be going on in there.

 What we have here is the unfurling of a 

banner on a sidewalk in a crowd with kids throwing

snowballs waiting for some -- somebody to run by with a 

TV camera nearby. And there is a real question as to 

whether, it seems to me, as to whether it is in a kind 

of practical, real world sense, disruptive of anything. 

And if there is such a question, shouldn't the answer 

favor the right to, to make the speech as opposed to 

favor the right to suppress it?

 MR. STARR: Your Honor, the answer is no.

 We do think that if the test that this Court 

has articulated which we embrace, looks not simply to 

"disruption" but inconsistency with what this Court has 

focused -- this Court's language, the basic educational 

mission, then surely --

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Let me, let me 

follow, actually ask you the same question on -- on 

that. Because in response to Justice Scalia's question 

you said certainly that the school has got the right to 

have a policy that forbids violating the law and calling 

for violations of the law.

 Accepting that as a premise, don't we need, 

before the school may suppress the speech, don't we need 

at least a statement which is clearly inconsistent with 

that policy? And if that is so, is Bong Hits 4 Jesus 

inconsistent with it? It sounds like just a kid's 

provocative statement to me.

MR. STARR: Your Honor, with all due 

respect, the key is to allow the school official to 

interpret the message as long as that interpretation is 

reasonable. You might disagree with that just as 

Justice Brennan disagreed with whether Matt Frazier's 

speech was all that terrible. But he said even though 

it wasn't all that terrible I nonetheless defer to the 

interpretation of school officials. That's what our 

educational system is about.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But those were the words 

and characterizing them as offensive/ but here one could 

look at these words and say it's just nonsense. Or one 

could say it's like mares-eat-oats. It isn't clear that 

this is "smoke pot."

 MR. STARR: Your Honor, again, Deborah 

Morse, a conscientious principal, interpreted the 

message in light of the subculture of the school where 

drug use is a serious problem. And it was on the spot 

judgment. We believe that judgment was reasonable as 

opposed to a judgment reached in judicial chambers, but 

we know that that was also the judgment of the 

superintendent and district judge --

message? Let's assume it was an ambiguous message. 

Would we have to accept her interpretation on summary 

judgment?

 MR. STARR: Yes, I believe you do. And --

well, that's of course a question for the district 

judge. And here the judge analyzed the facts in terms 

of what the individual was trying to say and determined 

that that is a reasonable interpretation and that is all 

that is required under this Court's law.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, 

ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING PETITIONERS

 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court.

 The First Amendment does not require public 

school officials to stand aside and permit students who 

are entrusted to their supervision and care to promote 

or encourage the use of illegal drugs. As this Court 

observed in Earls, the nationwide drug - drug epidemic 

makes the war against drugs a pressing concern in every 

school.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And is that the rationale 

on which you wish us to decide this case, nothing more 

broad?

 MR. KNEEDLER: The Court need not decide 

anything more broadly than that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking what your 

recommendation is to what our rule should be this case.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think this is a 

manifestation of the principle articulated in Earls and 

repeated in Hazelwood that a, school does not have to 

tolerate a message that is inconsistent with its basic 

educational --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's a very -- I 

find that a very, a very disturbing argument, because 

schools have and they can defined their educational 

mission so broadly that they can suppress all sorts of 

political speech and speech expressing fundamental 

values of the students, under the banner of, of -- of 

getting rid of speech that's inconsistent with 

educational missions.

 MR. KNEEDLER: That's why I think there 

would, there would be, it would make a lot of sense for 

the Court to articulate a rule that had to do with 

encouraging illegal conduct and particularly --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why go into this? I

mean, that's what I actually, seriously don't 

understand. Suppose the rule has the following rule: 

by the way, on our field trips you can carry around 15 

foot banners. They can say anything. Except they can't 

talk about drugs and they can't talk about sex and they 

can't talk about -- I don't know. Or I'd say three 

things. Would that be constitutional?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well -- I think, I think a 

school could certainly prohibit the display of banners 

on a school trip or in a school assembly.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that this 

particular person had whispered to his next door 

neighbor, "Bong Hits 4 Jesus, heh heh heh," you know. 

Supposed that's what had happened?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. KNEEDLER: And that may well -- that may 

well be different. And that's why I --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. What would be 

different -- that's what I -- what a principal that has 

to act quickly sees across the street at a school 

meeting, a big banner go up making a joke out of drug 

use. So the principal acts.

 Now, are we supposed to divide that into 

little bitsy parts? Because as soon as we do we are 

going to get a rather interesting, complicated and very

difficult set of constitutional rules. But you want us 

to do that.

 MR. KNEEDLER: No. I do not. I think -- I 

think the point that you make that a principal sees the 

banner across the street and sees the word bong hits, 

and -- and at the very moment when the Olympic torch was 

about to arrive, I think it was. She made a quick 

judgment and an entirely reasonable one that the display 

of the slang words bong hits --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then you're not 

arguing for the broad educational mission, which is what 

you said at the first.

 MR. STARR: Well, there are several 

gradations that the Court could take: Advocacy of 

illegal conduct generally; more specifically advocacy of 

illegal drugs. But I believe -- I think it's important 

to recognize that this Court's precedents recognize --

recognize several different justifications for 

restricting student speech. In Tinker itself which 

dealt with political speech, the Court was careful to 

point out that even then, if the speech could be shown 

to present a threat of a material disruption to the 

class work, and I think this would answer your question, 

Mr. Chief Justice, if the teacher wants to teach 

Shakespeare, the teacher doesn't have to turn over the

class to political speech.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But that's a 

viewpoint-neutral regulation. This isn't, the principal 

didn't say this was a viewpoint-neutral regulation, did 

she?

 MR. KNEEDLER: No. No. And -- and, and 

just to finish, in Tinker even with a viewpoint concern, 

the Court said if you could show material disruption, 

and --- and the Court made that clear in Tinker, by, by 

its comparison to several lower court decisions where 

wearing buttons had been prohibited because they had 

caused disruption. And the third category in Tinker 

itself was where there would be an intrusion upon the 

rights of other students to be secure and be let alone. 

That's Tinker dealing with political speech.

 But in Frazier and Hazelwood the Court 

identified additional categories of speech that could be 

governed by the school, and this is in footnote 4 of 

Hazelwood. The Court made clear that the ability to 

regulate those categories of speech goes beyond the 

question of whether there would be disruption or whether 

there would be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so you think 

that the, not a 15 foot banner but a very discrete 

button that says "legalize marijuana," although it might

be covered as not being disruptive under Tinker, it 

could be inconsistent with the school's mission and 

prohibited on that basis?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think -- I think if, 

if the button is legalize marijuana during a referendum 

in the State, then that, that might be the category of 

political speech that could not be regulated.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And at -- at this very 

rally, I mean I thought your brief said that it's okay 

to work for change in existing law which such a sign 

would be, but it is not okay to violate the law. And no 

one was smoking pot in that crowd.

 MR. KNEEDLER: But -- but the, what was 

happening was a sign that was reasonably construed to 

encourage the use of illegal drugs.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Given the fact 

that this is a First Amendment case, isn't a court 

forced into the position if it's going to be consistent 

with what else we have said, even at the final appellate 

level, of giving pretty careful scrutiny to the 

statement itself in determining whether it may be 

suppressed or punished?

 And if we do that, is it such a reasonable 

construction that this is an -- an incitement to illegal 

drug use?

I mean it's a statement which makes, makes 

the drug law look a little ridiculous, I think, but I'm 

not sure that that is very distinguishable from a 

statement saying "you ought to change the drug law."

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I -- I think in, 

in this Court's decisions dealing with public schools, 

this Court has, has a consistent theme as to give 

deference to the judgments by the educators. Public 

schools --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Do we have to give -- let 

me ask you this. And maybe this is the, as far as we 

can go with it here.

 Is that the answer to the question here 

about what the statement means?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, if we give 

deference your argument wins. But if we don't give 

deference, then does anybody really know what the 

statement means?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I don't think the question is 

what Mr. Frederick intended. The question is what a 

reasonable observer would think. And the words "bong 

hits" are slang that would be particularly, have a 

particular characteristic of getting across to other 

student, and they suggest a casual tolerance and

encouragement of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What if the sign said 

"bong hits should be legal?"

 MR. KNEEDLER: I, I think that would be a 

judgment call. I think the, I think the casual use --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Under your view wouldn't 

the principal's judgment always prevail?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well it has to be a 

reasonable judgment and this is, this is reflected in 

Frazier.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that a question of fact 

or a question of law?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Pardon me?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is whether it's a 

reasonable judgment --

MR. KNEEDLER: I think ultimately it's a 

question of law, whether it's a reasonable judgment.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This, this -- this parade 

had a theme to celebrate the Olympics, with -- the high 

school kids are carrying the torch, the band is in it. 

And suppose the banner said vote for, vote Republican, 

vote Democrat. And he wants to be on the TV with that. 

Could this, the principal make him take that sign out of 

the ground in that it's inconsistent with the whole 

theme of, of, of the parade? Something like our Kurle

case?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. I -- I mean, I think 

for this reason. This was essentially an outdoor 

assembly, where the -- whether the students were 

assembled to watch a particular different, just as in an 

indoor assembly.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that different from the 

rationale you've put.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Again, that's why I 

don't think there's any one single rule that governs all 

cases. This, this I think falls under the Frazier 

standard, where the Court said that, that schools have a 

duty to inculcate matters of civility and to prepare 

students for citizenship, and not violating the law is 

an important part of that and teachers' act in loco 

parentis. They act as guardians and they should be able 

to do, as this Court says in Earls, what a reasonable 

guardian would do. That would mean don't allow people 

to encourage lawbreaking.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wasn't, it wasn't 

like an assembly, was it? As I understand it, the 

children were released from school, but they were not 

required to attend this event and they were not required 

to stand in front of the school on the opposite side. 

They weren't monitored by their teachers, so they -- and

there were nonstudents in the crowd. So it's not like a 

school assembly.

 MR. KNEEDLER: The students' present at the 

event, presence as the event, was like an assembly. 

Students may go into an assembly hall and not have to 

sit with their class. They were released from class, 

but they were not released from school or school 

supervision. There were teachers around there and the 

school could define what is the nature of our assembly 

at this public event and, just as in, in the auditorium 

a school could say there will be no political banners 

or, frankly, no banners about anything other than what 

the event is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Were they required to go to 

this event and could they have skipped off and gone home 

without violating --

MR. KNEEDLER: They were not allowed to go 

home. They were required, they were required --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They were required to 

attend.

there if the classroom teacher decided to let them go 

out there, but they were under school supervision at

ever say, we are letting you out on the street to 

celebrate the Olympics and to do only that? Was, was 

there an object to this release from the school building 

that was ever conveyed?

 MR. KNEEDLER: If I may, I don't think 

there's any question that he knew in advance that this 

was about the Olympics. That's why he made the sign. 

And they were released to go out and watch the torch go 

by. He hasn't raised any question of notice or due

that's by no means his chief object here. The 

overwhelming object is to assert his free speech --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, would you waive 

damages against this principal who has devoted her life 

to the school, and you're seeking damages for her for 

this sophomoric sign that was held up?

 MR. MERTZ: We are certainly willing to 

negotiate a minimum settlement of damages. That is not 

the object here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's a 

broader issue of whether principals and teachers around 

the country have to fear that they're going to have to 

pay out of their personal pocket whenever they take 

actions pursuant to established board policies that they 

think are necessary to promote the school's educational 

mission.

 MR. MERTZ: That is indeed a legitimate 

fear, Your Honor, and we believe the existing law takes 

care of it by requiring before qualified immunity can be 

breached that there be a demonstration that under the 

existing law at the time available to her --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you think it was 

clearly established that she had to allow a student at a 

school- supervised function to hold a 15-foot banner 

saying "Bong Hits 4 Jesus"?

MR. MERTZ: I think it was clearly

could not engage in viewpoint censorship of a 

nondisruptive expression, under both Ninth Circuit law 

and this Court's law. The case had --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Does that, does that 

general statement that you just made apply to all 

circumstances in which a student-teacher relationship 

might be involved? For example, in the course of 

teaching a class in Shakespeare would your rule prevail?

 MR. MERTZ: The rule on qualified immunity?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, the general rule which 

the teacher is supposed clearly to have known here. For 

example, in the Shakespeare class, kid doesn't, doesn't 

say anything. He doesn't yell or scream or even raise 

his hand. He just holds a little sign in the 

Shakespeare class that says "Bong Hits 4 Jesus." As I 

understood the general rule that you said the teacher 

was bound to know here, the teacher I suppose would be 

required or the school would be required to tolerate 

that sign in the Shakespeare class; is that correct?

 MR. MERTZ: I believe the analysis would be 

the Tinker analysis in terms of substantial disruption 

of the lesson.

substantial disruption?

 MR. MERTZ: It would all depend on the 

circumstances. My guess is that if it were simply 

passively --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If the kids look around and 

they say, well, so and so has got his bong sign again --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- they then return, they 

then return to MacBeth. Does the -- does the, does the 

teacher have to, does the school have to tolerate that 

sign in the Shakespeare class?

 MR. MERTZ: I believe that in circumstances 

where it is a substantial distraction --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can't it just say no 

signs when you're supposed to be learning?

 MR. MERTZ: Your Honor, I think the answer 

is yes if they had a content-neutral rule prohibiting 

signs in school. I believe that would be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But can't the school 

decide that it's part of its mission to try to prevent 

its student from engaging in drug use and so that it's 

going to have a viewpoint on drug use and that viewpoint 

is going to be that it's opposed to it and so that it 

takes a particular view with respect to signs that in 

their view seem to encourage drug use?

MR. MERTZ: Certainly it is within the 

school's mission to discourage drug use. Certainly it 

has many tools to allow it to get its own viewpoint --

certainly it can -- it does not need to provide a forum 

in the school itself for students with a contrary 

viewpoint. But when a student is basically on his own 

time, whether it's outside of school --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position 

would be different if this were in the student gym and 

they were having a discussion. There was a program to 

discourage drug use and he held up his sign; you would 

say it would be all right to take down the sign inside 

the school gym?

 MR. MERTZ: No, I'm not so sure.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it doesn't matter 

that this is outside. It matters on the content of the 

sign, not the location?

 MR. MERTZ: Well, what matters is whether 

there is a substantial disruption of what the school is 

trying to achieve legitimately, whether it's a classroom 

lesson or a lesson on drug use.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but the school has --

the school has a program, an anti -drug program that 

shows movies, it brings in policemen and social workers 

to preach against drug use and you're saying that --

never mind unfurling a banner. You're saying that it 

has to let students contradict this message it's trying 

to teach, to walk around, you know, with a button that 

says "Smoke Pot, It's Fun."

 MR. MERTZ: I believe, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Does the school have to do 

that?

 MR. MERTZ: I believe, Your Honor, that a 

nondisruptive pin, badge, whatever you want to call it, 

would have to be tolerated. However, they would not 

have to tolerate a student who interrupts a anti-drug 

presentation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the school, even though 

it is trying to teach one point of view, can allow 

students to come in and undermine that point of view, 

assuming that it's legitimate to teach that point of 

view? It can allow students to come in and undermine 

what it's trying to teach?

 MR. MERTZ: I think that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that is not disruption 

in your view?

 MR. MERTZ: I think they cannot prevent 

presentation of a contrary viewpoint as long as it is 

done in such a way that it doesn't interfere with the 

school's own presentation of its viewpoint.

the time, where there was an active public debate on 

marijuana policy, on marijuana for medical use, 

marijuana for personal use, so it's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's a political 

-- even assuming it's a political issue, the question is 

whether the school has to say our classrooms, our field 

trips, our sponsored and supervised activities are a 

forum for that debate?

looks across the street, a 15-foot banner goes up at 

what's supposed to be a school event with everybody 

together in a single place, and it says a joke, it makes 

a joke out of drug use. The principal thinks of course 

adolescents and post-adolescents sometimes like to test

limits, and if the kids go around having 15-foot banners 

making a joke out of drug use that really does make it a 

little tougher for me to convince the students at this 

school not to use drugs, and particularly putting up 

15-foot banners. I don't know why everybody wants to 

get away from that because I think you would have had a 

very different case if in fact it had been a whisper or 

if it had been a serious effort to contest the drug 

laws. It wasn't either. It was a joke. It was a 

15-foot banner. We have the message plus the means plus 

the school event.

 Now, what's your response?

 MR. MERTZ: My response, Your Honor, is 

that, first of all, a 14-foot banner.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's an excellent 

response, I think.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MERTZ: That was just a preliminary. In 

fact, what it was was a person displaying this banner in 

a quiet, passive manner that didn't interfere with 

anybody's observation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I conceive that 

interference consists of it's pretty hard to run a 

school where kids go around at public events publicly 

making a joke out of drugs. That's what his thought is.

Now, I don't think he has to be able to read content 

discrimination, viewpoint discrimination, time-place. 

He doesn't know the law, the principal. His job is to 

run the school. And so I guess what I'm worried about 

is a rule that would -- is on your side, a rule that 

takes your side; we'll suddenly see people testing 

limits all over the place in the high schools. But a 

rule that against your side may really limit people's 

rights on free speech. That's what I'm struggling with. 

Now, I want some help there and I'm worried about the 

principal.

 MR. MERTZ: I believe the answer is that the 

Tinker case as we understand it struck a very wise 

compromise between allowing school officials to have 

complete discretion to suppress student speech in order 

to maintain what they conceive of as their individual 

mission and the student's right to speak in a 

nondisruptive manner. The speaker -- the Tinker case 

has stood the test of time for 40, almost 30 years and, 

although --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you can say that, but 

the subsequent cases seem to me to try to cut back on 

it. I mean, it stood the test of time in the sense that 

it hasn't been overruled, but --

MR. MERTZ: There have been some narrow

exceptions to it in subsequent cases, of course, the 

Frazier and the Kuhlmeier cases. But the basic, the 

heart of it, the requirement that the school demonstrate 

that substantial disruption before it can engage in 

suppression of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think we're using 

disruption in two different senses here and we should 

probably separate the two. One sense is disrupting the 

class so that whatever is being taught can't be taught. 

But you're also using it in the sense of undermining a 

general message that the school is trying to get across: 

Obey the law, don't use drugs, whatever. Maybe we 

should have a different word for -- the first is 

disruption. Disruption is a, is a funny word for the 

second. Let's called it undermining instead.

 Now, you think both of them, however, are 

bad and both of them can be a basis for suppressing the 

speech?

 MR. MERTZ: If I understand your question 

correctly, the second of them might better be called 

allowing competing viewpoints.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you think undermining is 

perfectly okay? You would never consider undermining to 

be disruption and therefore bad?

 MR. MERTZ: I think undermining in the sense

of preventing impeding the school from delivering its 

own message --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but only that.

 MR. MERTZ: -- would be substantial 

disruption.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right after a class on 

drugs, he can be standing there in the hall and say: 

This class was ridiculous, drugs are good for you, I use 

them all the time, I urge all of you. That's perfectly 

okay? That's not undermining?

 MR. MERTZ: I believe that is the kind of 

speech --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not disruption?

 MR. MERTZ: -- that we must tolerate no 

matter how unwise it is.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But couldn't the school, 

couldn't the school board have a time, place, or manner 

regulation that says you're not going to use the halls 

to proselytizer for your cause, whatever it may be?

 MR. MERTZ: I believe that's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You could have reasonable 

rules of decorum for what goes on inside the school 

building.

 MR. MERTZ: Right.

to be completely neutral in that respect? Does it have 

to punish who says that was a good program, I'm not 

going to use drugs, and you shouldn't either, because 

he's taking position on a public issue?

 MR. MERTZ: I think a content neutral, 

content neutrality is critical here, and if the school 

wants to allow anti-drug comments, messages, then it has 

an outside of the official forum --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where does that 

notion that our schools have to be content neutral -- I 

thought we wanted our schools to teach something, 

including something besides just basic elements, 

including the character formation and not to use drugs. 

They have to be neutral on whether you should use drugs 

or not?

 MR. MERTZ: Content neutrality goes to what 

speech is suppressed or punished. As far as the school 

delivering its own message, there is no requirement of 

equal time or that it be neutral. It's got its own 

viewpoint in the case of drugs, a viewpoint that almost 

all of us agree with, and it should be able to espouse 

JUSTICE SCALIA: A school isn't an open 

forum. A school isn't there for everybody to teach the 

students whatever he wants. It's there for the teachers

to instruct. And you're turning it into an open forum. 

If the school says, addresses one issue, everybody else 

has to be able to address that issue.

 MR. MERTZ: I don't believe that's the case 

at all, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not my vision of 

what a school is.

 MR. MERTZ: In the classroom delivering the 

prescribed messages, in the school assemblies, when the 

school wishes to present a particular message, that's 

one case. However, in the lunchroom, outside in recess, 

across the street, that is a quintessentially open forum 

where it would not be proper, I think, to tell students 

you may not mention this subject, you may not take this 

position.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But do you concede that 

there was some right of school control for what was 

going on across the street?

 MR. MERTZ: No. Actually our primary 

position on that is that he was in a public place at a 

public event among public people --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If kids were throwing 

bottles and injuring passers by, the principal had no 

right or duty to go over there and stop it?

engaging in an act of hooliganism --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's because the 

school has a right of control.

 MR. MERTZ: There is a distinction here. 

This young man had not been in school today, had not 

been an campus, was not in any class that was released 

to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did he go where 

he went?

 MR. MERTZ: Pardon?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did he choose 

that location to unfurl his banner?

only place where he actually knew the route of the 

relay.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But I mean, that's -- I 

have, I guess his note, you accept this with what the 

teacher said. The entire class went to view the relay. 

Individual students -- this is at 9:30 in the morning. 

They were not given the option of remaining in class, 

nor were they released to do as they pleased. They were 

to watch the relay with the rest of the student body, 

either just in front of the school or just across the 

street -- that's me, not them -- and then return 

directly to their classrooms, which I guess the school

did. So it sounds like you're going to one place, stand 

together, behave yourselves, watch the relay, and the 

teachers will be there and take you back to class. Now 

is there something else in the record that suggests 

something different?

 MR. MERTZ: There is a major dispute on that 

point, Your Honor. We presented several affidavits that 

showed individual teachers --

JUSTICE BREYER: Just tell me where to look. 

Where are the conflicting affidavits? I'm just reading 

from page 51 of the joint appendix. I didn't know there 

was a dispute.

 MR. MERTZ: It would be on pages 32, 34, 36.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, I'll look at those. 

Another somewhat minor point. Can I ask you another 

point about the record? I'll read those.

 MR. MERTZ: Okay. Can I finish the 

description of what actually happened? According to the 

students, for those who were released from class, there 

was no requirement for staying on campus, and many of 

them did not stay on campus. No requirement for --

street.

motions for summary judgment in the district court, and 

there were no findings, actually no factual findings at 

all, and certainly nothing on that particular point.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you another 

record point, just so I know where to look?

 MR. MERTZ: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You've also asked for an 

injunction that would require expunging his 5-day 

suspension from his record.

 MR. MERTZ: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: 10 days. Well, 10 or 5, 

unclear. I noticed the superintendent of schools on 

page 66A when he's reviewing this, what he says is, 

"Joseph contends that all his behavior is excusable 

because he was exercising his free of speech right. 

Even if I were to concede his speech across from the 

high school is protected, which I do not, the rest of 

his behavior warranted the suspension." And then he 

says, "And I'm cutting it from 10 days to 5. So given 

that, if you win, suppose you were to win, and you --

that it is protected and so forth -- then would you 

concede or not concede the suspension, the 5 days, it's 

over, it still stands, I don't care about the 

expungement or not?

record, anything that remains on his record is obviously 

much more --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, but I'm asking that you 

think about it. I'm putting you on the spot.

 MR. MERTZ: In that case, I missed the point 

of your --

JUSTICE BREYER: I want to know what the 

superintendent said. As I read it is, he says, look, I 

don't care if this was protected or not. I'll give you 

that. It's protected. But the rest of his behavior, 

the way he treated the principal, what he did, the 

reluctance, et cetera, et cetera, that warrants a 

suspension too, and I'm cutting it from 10 days to 5. 

So it sounds to me as I read it that the teacher is 

saying even if you're right, he's still suspended for 5 

days. That's what the superintendent says.

 Now suppose you win your point that you're 

interested in winning, which you may not or you may. 

Are you still then going to pursue this case on the 5 

days, that that should be erased?

 MR. MERTZ: If the only thing left were 

discipline because he was tardy that day, was -- didn't 

divulge the names of the other people holding the 

banner, that sort of thing, we couldn't --

anymore.

 MR. MERTZ: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can we get back --

I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Go ahead.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can we get back to 

what the case is about. You think the law was so 

clearly established when this happened that the 

principal, that the instant that the banner was 

unfurled, snowballs are flying around, the torch is 

coming, should have said oh, I remember under Tinker I 

can only take the sign down if it's disruptive. But 

then under Frazier I can do something if it interferes 

with the basic mission, and under Kuhlmeier I've got 

this other thing. So she should have known at that 

point that she could not take the banner down, and it 

was so clear that she should have to pay out of her own 

pocket because of it.

MR. MERTZ: Mr. Chief Justice, there are two 

different time points we have to talk about. There's 

the heat of the moment out there on the street, but then 

later back in the office when she actually decided to 

levy the punishment after she had talked to him, after 

she heard why he did it and why he didn't do it, after 

she had had a chance to consult with the school 

district's counsel. At that point in the calmness of 

her office, then she should indeed have known it. And 

she did testify that she had taken a master's degree 

course in school law in which she studied Kuhlmeier and 

Frazier and Tinker. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so it should be 

perfectly clear to her exactly what she could and 

couldn't do.

 MR. MERTZ: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: As it is to us, right?

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, we have had a 

debate here for going on 50 minutes about what Tinker 

means, about the proper characterization of the 

behavior, the nonspeech behavior. The school's terms in 

dealing with the kids that morning. The meaning of the, 

of the statement. We've been debating this in this 

courtroom for going on an hour, and it seems to me

however you come out, there is reasonable debate. 

Should the teacher have known, even in the, in the calm 

deliberative atmosphere of the school later, what the 

correct answer is?

 MR. MERTZ: We believe at the very least she 

should have known that one cannot punish a nondisruptive 

holding of a sign because it said something you 

disagreed with.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course I disagree with 

the characterization on disruptive. It was completely 

disruptive of the message, of the theme that the school 

wanted to promote. Completely disruptive of the reason 

for letting the students out to begin with. Completely 

disruptive of the school's image that they wanted to 

portray in sponsoring the Olympics.

 MR. MERTZ: Well, they weren't sponsoring 

the Olympics, they weren't even sponsoring this event 

actually. They simply let the students out to watch it. 

That was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Some of the students were 

carrying the torch and the band was playing in the 

parade.

 MR. MERTZ: A few of the student -- a few of 

the relay runners were from the school and had been 

allowed to skip school because of that, and the pep band

played as it went by. I do not believe that made the 

torch relay a school event. The best that can be said 

for them is that they let the students watch it with the 

concurrence of individual teachers, and that that 

attendance was a school sanctioned attendance. Now 

whether that allows them to then engage in this kind of 

punishment for speech by a student who was not even 

among those released, who is standing --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now you said that in your 

brief, and I couldn't understand that somehow you got 

mileage out of his being truant that morning. Would the 

case have come out differently, would you be making any 

different argument if he got to school on time and was 

released with the rest of them? Does the case turn on 

the fact that he was late to school that day?

 MR. MERTZ: We believe it would be a closer 

question, but the fact that he was not there in school 

today, and intentionally was not there today, turns this 

into a pure free speech case where you have a citizen in 

a public place in a public event who was not acting as a 

student.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So he's not a school 

child, he would be playing hooky?

 MR. MERTZ: Because he was playing hooky

part of the class.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though the law 

required him to be there?

 MR. MERTZ: That's right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He wasn't playing hooky. 

He showed up late, that's all, right? I mean, he 

actually came and joined his classmates at an event that 

he knew was an event that the school told the classes to 

go to.

 MR. MERTZ: He joined --

JUSTICE SCALIA: As far as I'm concerned, he 

just showed up late.

 MR. MERTZ: He joined a public crowd on a 

private side -- public sidewalk in front of private 

homes. The crowd happened to have some other students 

in that school there.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did he go 

immediately after? He went to the school building for 

whatever it was, the third period of the day.

 MR. MERTZ: Yes. The principal instructed 

him to do so and he did.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So under your view, if the 

principal sees something wrong in the crowd across the 

street, had to come up and say now, how many here are 

truants and how many here are -- I can't discipline you

because you're a truant, you can go ahead and throw the 

bottle.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MERTZ: No, I don't think she needs to 

do that in the heat of the moment. But later on once 

she's discovered the true facts, then at that point I 

think she loses a basis for punishing him as a student 

if he was not there as a student.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because you're both a 

truant and disrupter, you get off.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Had you been just a 

disrupter, tough luck.

 MR. MERTZ: Well, it may well be that he 

could have been punished for being truant, but of course 

that's not why we're here. He was punished for 

displaying, for the content of the sign he was 

displaying in a public place as a private citizen.

helped him hold up his flag? Were they not classmates 

of his?

least one was not a student.

there yourself and then join the class as it's going 

through the zoo. It seems to me he's in school.

 MR. MERTZ: A better analogy might be if he 

had gone on his own time to the zoo and was engaging in 

some expressive act, and there happened to be a school 

group there at the same time, could the teacher with 

that group then have disciplined him for what he was 

doing?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That gets back to 

the point I was trying to make earlier. He came here 

because it was the school event, the school sponsored 

activity. He could have gone anywhere along the route. 

He knew that it was coming by the school, he knew that 

they were going to be, the students were going to be 

released to see it. He went to join up with the school 

even if he were truant that day.

 MR. MERTZ: No, Your Honor. I believe 

that's incorrect. There is nothing in the record that 

even suggests that he went there in order to join up

with schoolmates or in order to be near the school. He 

says, in fact, he intentionally tried to avoid the 

school because he thought that that way he could avoid 

the school jurisdiction for his --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You think he could have 

been marked absent for the whole day because he didn't 

intend to be part of the school group afterwards? I 

mean, suppose there's a suspension of so much for half a 

day truancy, and so much more for a whole day's truancy. 

And he shows up and he says, oh, you can't -- you have 

to hold me for a whole day's truancy because I didn't 

intend to be in school. I was in school but I didn't 

intend to be there.

 MR. MERTZ: I think it would all depend on 

whether he --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't make any sense 

to me. Does it depend on his intent, whether or not he 

intended to be a truant that afternoon?

 MR. MERTZ: I think that would depend on the 

fact of whether he was a truant that afternoon.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He was either in school or 

he wasn't in school.

 MR. MERTZ: In the morning he wasn't in 

school.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: In the afternoon he either

was or he wasn't.

 MR. MERTZ: In the afternoon he was.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And the question is whether 

joining the school group, intentionally joining the 

school group, going there because the school group was 

there, whether that places him in school.

 MR. MERTZ: As a hypothetical, if he were 

intentionally joining a school group, I would have to 

say that puts him within whatever jurisdiction the 

school has.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why does it matter? That 

is, why doesn't the -- you're suing the teacher or the 

principal and why wouldn't the issue be what that 

principal really reasonably thought the situation was? 

I mean, if a principal reasonably thought he was part of 

the school group, if the principal reasonably thought 

that this was a school outing, if the principal 

reasonably thought that students are staying together, 

why wouldn't that just be the ground on which you'd take 

the case, we should take it that way, because the 

principal reasonably thinks?

 MR. MERTZ: As far as qualified immunity, I 

think that's correct, if she had a reasonable belief.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But even on the merits?

 MR. MERTZ: On the merits I don't think so,

because if he was not in fact there as part of a school 

group --

JUSTICE BREYER: Even if the principal 

couldn't tell him to take down the manner even if she 

thought he was part of the school group reasonably, if 

he really wasn't?

 MR. MERTZ: I do not believe there's 

anything in the law that allows a principal to convert a 

pure free speech exercise into a school exercise because 

it's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you were going to 

appeal to the calm of her office the next day. I 

thought that was going to be your answer to my question. 

Whatever she thought at the time, she didn't think it 

later.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask to you clarify 

one thing. I initiated this line of questioning when I 

said I was surprised that your brief made such a big 

deal that he was late to school. You would still be 

making the argument about the free speech right if he 

had diligently showed up for his math class first period 

in the morning, gone out with the others, and had his 

banner to unfurl when the torch came by?

 MR. MERTZ: That is correct. We have two 

independent bases for defending him here. One is the

pure free speech in a public place argument. That's the 

one that hinges on the fact that he was not among the 

released students. The other argument, which we believe 

in equally, is that even if it were a on-campus or on an 

extension of campus like a field trip, then under Tinker 

because it was not disruptive they cannot punish it.

 My time is up. I thank the Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Mertz.

 Mr. Starr, you have a minute remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. STARR: For the reasons that have been 

discussed, under no circumstances should Deborah Morse, 

a conscientious principal, be subjected to the 

possibility of punitive damages or compensatory damages.

 A very brief factual point. In light of the 

richness of the discussion with respect to the facts, I 

would guide the Court to page 109 of the joint appendix. 

This is Deborah Morse's interrogatory answer and there 

she sets forth the facts, and that bleeds into the law.

 To promote drugs -- and this is our 

fundamental suggestion and submission. To promote drugs 

is utterly inconsistent with the basic educational 

mission of the school, and for this Court to suggest to

the contrary would really be quite inconsistent with 

much of its drug jurisprudence, Bernonia and Earls. The 

opinion of the Court in Earls 2002 is especially 

powerful with respect to the scourge of drugs and their 

dangers.

 More broadly, the Court does not need to go 

more broadly, but the Court has spoken more broadly with 

respect to the need to defer to school officials in 

identifying the educational mission. But we know that 

there are in fact constitutional limits. Those limits 

are captured in Tinker. A passive pure political speech 

that reflects on the part of the school board a 

standardless discretionary effort to squelch any kind of 

controversial discussion, that casts a pall of orthodoxy 

over the classroom. We are light years away from that.

 I thank the Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel, 

the case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
