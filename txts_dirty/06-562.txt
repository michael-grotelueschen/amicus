 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 06-562, United States versus 

Atlantic Research Corporation. 

Mr. Hungar.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 In Section 113(f) of CERCLA, Congress 

created a precisely drawn detailed mechanism for 

potentially responsible parties to recover their 

response costs from other PRPs. Respondent seeks to 

circumvent the limitations that Congress imposed on that 

remedy by manufacturing a parallel mechanism for 

contribution-like relief under Section 107. 

Respondent's theory should be rejected because it 

violates fundamental canons of statutory construction, 

renders Section 113(f) superfluous, makes a mockery of 

the textual limitations enforced by this Court in Cooper 

Industries, and would frustrate Congress's clear intent 

to encourage settlements with the government in order to 

achieve supervised effective cleanups.

 Respondent essentially asks this Court to

create a shadow contribution scheme under the guise of 

Section 107(a) by borrowing all of the features of the 

Section 113(f) remedy except the one that Respondent 

can't satisfy, namely the requirement that contribution 

be sought only during or following a civil action or 

settlement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hungar, was this 

Court wrong in your view, it wasn't dispositive of the 

case in Key Tronic when it said, "Section 107 

unquestionably provides a cause of action for private 

parties to seek recovery of cleanup costs?"

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, we agree that 

Section 107(a)(1) through (4)(b), subparagraph (b) 

creates a cause of action for private parties, in 

particular the private parties who are not PRPs, who are 

therefore other persons other than the PRPs who are the 

subject of that statutory sentence. So we agree in that 

sense. We don't think it creates a cause of action for 

the particular private parties who are trying to sue in 

this case, that is PRPs.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you think that when 

the Court says this, it didn't contemplate that PRPs 

would be included among private parties?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, in Key Tronic, obviously 

the Court was facing a different question so I don't

think it was trying to in any way authoritatively 

resolve this issue, as the Court held in Cooper 

Industries. But I -- certainly there is language in 

Cooper -- excuse me, in Key Tronic that can be read to 

suggest that the Court assumed or thought there was some 

sort of remedy for PRPs. It's not clear whether it was 

referring to contribution or some other remedy. But in 

Cooper Industries, the Court made clear that that was 

dicta and that's in our view correct, because the Court 

in Key Tronic was faced with a different question 

altogether.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Who were the PRPs, or who 

are the individuals other than PRPs who are likely to, 

to avail themselves to the cause of action under Section 

7? That's one of the problems I have. I mean, it's got 

to be someone other than owners of the land now, owners 

of the land then. I mean, who's going to bring these 

actions?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, people who are -- who are 

excluded by other provisions of Section 107 from the 

category of liable parties would be entitled to bring 

such an action if they don't --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But can you give me an idea 

of generally --

MR. HUNGAR: A city that cleans up a site

and that is not itself --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's not -- you know, 

that's not a private party within the meaning of the 

quotation.

 MR. HUNGAR: No, it is, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Pardon?

 MR. HUNGAR: It is, because a city can't sue 

under subparagraph (a). Only the State can sue.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's not the United 

States of America, but we wouldn't normally refer to it 

as a private party. And -- but I don't mean to get tied 

up in that, but can you think of any individuals or 

corporations who are not likely to come in to one of the 

four categories in 7 who would, who would take advantage 

of this?

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. And first of 

all, just let me make clear: Subparagraph (b) doesn't 

refer to private parties only; it says any other person.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No I realize that. I'm 

trying to --

MR. HUNGAR: But with respect to private 

parties in particular, any private party who was a 

so-called innocent person under the statute, who because 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No. Those are people who

would have a defense under the later sections of --

subsections of Section 7. They are still people who 

would fall within the first four categories.

 MR. HUNGAR: I think, Your Honor, that you 

have to read the statutory sentence in Section 107(a) as 

a whole, and what it says is that the people in these 

categories, owners, operators, arrangers and so forth, 

collect in the conjunctive, shall be liable for -- and 

then under (b), any other necessary cost or response 

incurred by any other person.

 And that the other provisions of the statute 

such as subparagraph (b) with respect to the third party 

defense, subparagraph (d), subparagraphs that create --

I mean, I'm sorry, subsections that create various 

defenses, what they say is if you satisfy this defense, 

you're not liable. You are taken out of the category of 

liable parties, the category that is the subject of this 

statutory sentence. And therefore in our view, you 

become an other person. So people who are able to 

satisfy the defenses are other persons, and that's what 

the lower courts have held in cases where this has come 

up.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you know that when 

they go into court. Let's assume they bring the action 

and the answer is well, you fall into one of the

categories one through four, and the person says oh, but 

I -- I'm not liable because ultimately I will have an 

innocent party defense. Would we then have a collateral 

trial on the innocent party defense in -- in the cause 

of action for, for reimbursement?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, I don't think it's a 

collateral trial. It's just one of the issues in the 

case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I mean if that would be 

the first issue, we'd have to try the innocence of the 

person who was bringing the action?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, I think the court could 

obviously structure the issues as it saw fit but 

certainly that would be one the issues in the case, but 

again people in that category aren't the only --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well the -- the trouble 

with having, I mean the trouble with that approach is 

that whatever you, whatever may be the ultimate effect 

of subsection (b) is referred to as defenses. And the 

way you're using it the so-called defenses would be an 

-- an affirmative element in the action for, for, for 

cost reimbursement with is just -- and I mean it 

certainly at the least would involve a very odd language 

usage in the statute.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well I don't think so because

what the statute says is people, the people who are the 

subject of the sentence shall be liable to other 

persons. And if someone by virtue of the statute is 

rendered not liable --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but you --

MR. HUNGAR: -- they are not in the 

subject; they are in the other category.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well you've glided 

over the great difficulty which is it doesn't say that 

people identified in the statute shall be liable to 

other persons. It says they will be liable to, under 

certain circumstances, the United States, a State or an 

Indian tribe and they are liable for -- for other costs 

incurred by any other person. And it just seems that 

the most natural reading of that construction is that 

the other refers to other than the United States or a 

State or an Indian tribe.

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, that would 

certainly be a -- a permissible reading of the statute, 

were it not for the other "other." The -- the statute 

in subparagraph (b) refers to any, provides a cause of 

action or refers, really imposes liability for any 

"other" necessary costs. The other necessary costs --

that other, the only other costs that that "other" can 

refer to are the costs of governmental entities, the

United States and the States and Indian tribes under 

subparagraph (a). So the first other in subparagraph 

(b) makes clear that it's not talking about the 

subparagraph (a) claims; it's talking about other 

claims, because by definition the United States or a 

State cannot recover under (b) by virtue of the first 

other.

 Congress in the development of this 

language, the first other was already in the statutory 

language. Congress, at the last minute there was a 

change, a compromise in order to get the bill passed and 

reduce the onerousness of its provisions, and they added 

the second other. The only logical explanation and the 

only way to give effect to the second other is to 

construe it as we do.

 JUSTICE ALITO: In the years since CERCLA 

was enacted have there been any real cases in which a 

party that you would regard as an innocent party has 

brought a cost recovery action?

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, sir. And actually there's 

an annotation that, that collects the cases. We haven't 

done an exhaustive survey, but certainly the annotation 

is -- which is at 12 A.L.R. F.2d 161 -- collects a 

number of such cases. And the lower courts have 

addressed these questions and have, and adjudicated them

so this is not a novel suggestion. And it's one that 

has arisen because, because remember, under the well 

established law of every circuit that had addressed the 

question prior to the Cooper Industries decision, a PRP 

could not sue solely under Section 107(a). They had to 

sue, they had to comply with the, the Section 113 

mechanism, and the courts held that in order to avoid 

the disastrous consequences that would ensue if 

respondents or the court of appeals --

JUSTICE BREYER: What are -- what are they? 

I mean as I read this, I can't get anything out of the 

language. I mean the two "others" might just make it 

more clear. So we have another Section 113 that talks 

about contribution and it says you can get contribution 

if there has been a lawsuit, and so forth, or if there 

has been a settlement. Fine.

 Now the question comes up, well, suppose 

there hasn't been a lawsuit or a settlement. Now if we 

look at the language here, at least my initial reading 

of it, it does not say. It says that they are liable. 

These PRPs are liable to this other PRP or person there. 

But it doesn't just say explicitly bring a suit, and it 

doesn't say explicitly you can't bring a suit.

 So I think well, why can't he bring a suit? 

If he brings a suit how is the sky to fall? On the

other hand, if you don't let him bring a suit, they say 

well, maybe the Government just -- will just stay out of 

this. The Government won't enter into settlements 

because the Government is a big polluter. And it would 

not like to get sued often, so they will stay away from 

the settlement and be home free.

 So that's what they say on your -- on their 

side, I think, primarily. What do you say on your side? 

How will the sky fall if in fact they win and they can 

bring suits under 107?

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the sky will fall 

because under that interpretation PRPs can evade the 

settlement bar that Congress enacted in order to 

encourage settlement, and Congress's clear goal in 

providing a contribution remedy and providing an 

explicit opportunity for PRPs to sue was to encourage 

settlement with the Government. Congress wanted to 

reduce litigation, encourage settlement and Government 

supervised cleanups, and so it created the settlement 

bar in Section 113(f)(2), which, if a PRP settles with 

the Government, the United States or a State, settles 

for a response cost liability, it then has a 

contribution action to --

a State" because I thought that there was some

suggestion that States, they don't want to bother with 

the Federal legislation, so they'll say you're okay 

under the State legislation. You can't force a State to 

-- to take on that responsibility.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, Your Honor in our view 

what Section 113(f)(3)(b), the settlement contribution 

provision, requires is that a State settle, the parties 

settle with the State and resolve its liability to the 

State for response costs which is a defined term under 

CERCLA.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The States, we have a 

brief from the States telling us look, we don't want to 

put our money on that kind of thing. We've got very 

high-risk sites and we want to spend our resources 

making sure those are cleaned up.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, Your Honor, every State 

has a voluntary cleanup program which encourages parties 

to settle, and under many of those programs there is an 

opportunity if they do the settlement to required 

standards to obtain a discharge of liability from the 

State for response costs. And there is no reason why 

those settlement agreements can't be written and they 

often are.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, they -- they can. 

Of course they can but the States are telling us that

this puts a burden on them that they don't want.

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the States already 

have these programs in existence. There is no reason 

why the settlement language can't be written 

appropriately and moreover, in many States, I suspect 

most States, the PRPs are required to pay the costs of 

the State that it incurs in monitoring and in ensuring 

that the settlement agreement is appropriate. The State 

of Washington, for example, which is here today, if you 

look at the web site of its Department of Ecology, it 

has extensive procedures, extensive opportunities for 

parties to come to the State, present the information, 

obtain a settlement if they want -- if they will pay the 

State's costs in monitoring and making sure that what 

the PRP is doing is an appropriate cleanup. And that's 

what CERCLA should encourage. There are --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's just go back 

to Justice Breyer's question, because it was I think a 

major point of the Eighth Circuit. That is, they said 

the United States, the United States is a big polluter, 

could avoid its own responsibility by not bringing any 

enforcement action and by not settling, and you -- you 

said there would be a disincentive for the PRP -- a 

disincentive to settlement, but you didn't answer the 

question of why wouldn't the United States when it is a

polluter and it would be responsible on this site, to 

say well, we are going to, we are not going to settle?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, two -- two responses. 

Number one of course, if that happened, there is always 

the State option, the States settled thousands of cases. 

Number two, that's just not the way it works in 

practice. EPA has the enforcement authority with 

respect to these private, the private sites that we are 

talking about. EPA has no incentive not to do its job 

and every incentive to do its job.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what about the --

what about the statement in the red brief that -- that 

there is presently in existence a directive that EPA not 

proceed against any Federal agency?

 MR. HUNGAR: I -- I think what Your Honor is 

referring to is a directive perhaps that requires EPA to 

obtain the Attorney General's approval before it will 

issue a unilateral administrative order. But that 

doesn't apply to Section 107, excuse me, Section 106(1) 

consent orders the, the EPA issues. It enters into 

numerous settlement agreements in cases implicating 

Federal PRPs; we cited a number in our brief and there 

are many more, and -- and EPA has a detailed set of 

standards. They occupy a hundred pages.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, excuse me. Are cases

that you referred to cases in which EPA has gone against 

a -- we'll say a third party polluter, but the 

Government is also involved?

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes. We cite a number from the 

Federal Register.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Now, has EPA during 

the pendency of that directive gone directly against any 

Federal agency?

 MR. HUNGAR: If Your Honor means filing a 

lawsuit the answer is no --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No.

 MR. HUNGAR: -- because in our view EPA 

can't sue the United States. If Your Honor means, I 

mean definitely there are enforcement actions or --

proceeding. The way EPA normally works, just to be 

clear, is that when it learns of a site, it learns of a 

release of hazardous materials, it does a preliminary 

assessment to find out whether this is a problem or not, 

whether it's a problem that they should pay attention to 

or if they should instead refer to the State. And if 

it's of sufficient magnitude that it's for the EPA 

rather than the State to deal with, they proceed to 

identify all the PRPs they can sent notices to them and 

attempt to settle.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right --

they attempt to settle with the Department of Defense as

Defense --

don't know as a matter of procedure how they initiate 

enforcement action --

responsibility for their share of the liabilities, EPA 

can and will settle with them, regardless.

the Department of Defense?

JUSTICE SOUTER: In my hypo, the Department 

of Defense says you know, we are not talking with you.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, number one the Department 

of Defense has additional legal obligations to deal with 

hazardous waste even beyond anything EPA can do.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe it does. But let's 

just talk about EPA. What does EPA do in the case that, 

when Defense stonewalls?

 MR. HUNGAR: Just, just to be -- just to 

finish my last point, if I may -- which can be enforced 

by citizen suits.

 But leaving that point aside, if --

ultimately they would go to the Attorney General I 

suppose and ask for authority to issue a unilateral 

order. But I'm not aware that that problem is a 

significant one, and the fact is there are numerous 

settlements, and they don't, under -- under -- for

Respondent to have a cause of action, EPA doesn't have 

to settle with the Federal PRP; all they have to do is 

settle with the private PRP, and if the private PRP is 

willing to pay its share, which EPA determines according 

to standards about its -- vary, considering various 

factors about who contributed what and who caused which 

portion of the problem --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And at that point 113 would 

kick in --

MR. HUNGAR: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- regardless of Defense?

 MR. HUNGAR: Correct. And again if EPA 

somehow refused to settle, the -- they could settle with 

the State. So it's just not -- EPA does not have any 

incentive to block cleanups. EPA wants to encourage 

cleanups and if the best way to get the cleanup done is 

to settle with a private party, then that's what EPA is 

going to do.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why this case --

there's a point that was made by the Eighth Circuit, and 

also in the States' brief on page 24, and that is that 

the EPA was engaged in settlement negotiations with 

Atlantic Research, and then after this Court decided 

Cooper Industries that negotiation terminated.

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, that's not correct.

My understanding is that the negotiations were between, 

were -- Atlantic Research brought a claim seeking, 

seeking money from essentially the Defense Department, 

and my understanding was that the negotiations were only 

to settle Atlantic Research's claim whether you call it 

a contribution or a cost recovery claim, not an attempt 

by Atlantic Research to resolve its liability to the 

United States. They were not negotiating with EPA with 

respect to EPA's enforcement authority. They are 

negotiating with Justice Department lawyers in the 

environmental defense section who represent Federal PRP 

defendants. They weren't -- they weren't trying to 

resolve their liability in order to give rise to a 

contribution claim. What they were trying to do was 

merely make the United States pay them without first 

having resolved their own liability, which is why it 

makes no sense for them to be bringing a contribution 

claim.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I -- can I go back? 

Because I'm trying to, since I do find it so open with 

the language, what I'm doing is making what I call the 

list of acorns. You say the sky is falling and I want a 

comparative list.

acorn, which is if they don't win, EPA and DOD just are 

not going to settle these things because they want to 

escape us suing them. And you say, are you kidding? 

EPA loves to sue.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: And they like to settle. 

Don't worry about it. All right.

 On your side, you're saying well, you know, 

if we don't -- if we don't -- accept your 

interpretation, they won't enter into settlements. To 

which I guess they will make the same response. Are you 

kidding? The EPA loves to sue us and we are frightened 

of them and we'll settle.

 Okay. So I've got one acorn each side, now 

are there other acorns on the Government side; namely 

the sky is falling --

MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What are they? I'd just 

like to make the whole list of acorns.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, the first and foremost 

way in which the sky is falling is that the court of 

appeals approach, Respondent's approach would eviscerate 

the settlement bar, because the whole point of the 

settlement bar is to give parties an incentive to settle 

with the Government knowing that they will be protected

from contribution claims. But if Respondent has a cost 

recovery claim under Section 107, the settlement bar 

goes out the window. And in fact that's what a number 

of the courts of appeals have held in -- in making clear 

that Section 113 does govern these claims. EPA has 

entered into settlements with literally tens of 

thousands of PRPs.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you have to pay the 

costs. I mean, isn't that something of a disincentive? 

Before you can sue?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, but the claim here is 

that the parties want to pay the costs and incur 

voluntary cleanup costs anyway. They just don't want to 

settle first. So if I'm understanding your question --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. It would be one thing 

if you skip away from a settlement without having to pay 

any money. But in order to come under, under 9607, they 

have to, they have to shell out the money.

 MR. HUNGAR: Maybe I'm not understanding. 

My point, Your Honor, is that there are tens of 

thousands of parties who have already settled, shelling 

out some money or not, with the EPA in reliance on the 

unanimous view of the courts of appeals that PRPs could 

not sue them because the contribution bar protected 

them, Section 113(f) would protect them.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how sure are 

you -- how sure are you that it doesn't protect them 

still?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, Your Honor, what it 

applies to is contribution claims, and respondent and 

Respondent's amici are very clear that they want is not 

a contribution claim because they recognize that the 

settlement bar would preclude their claims, but a cost 

recovery claim, and Section 113(f)(2) says 

"contribution," not "cost recovery." Those are very 

clearly --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, when one 

responsible party has paid out the cost and is seeking a 

cost recovery claim from another responsible party, it's 

not too much of a stretch to call it a contribution 

claim, is it?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, Your Honor, if you want 

to call what the PRP is seeking a contribution claim, 

then we submit that it should be governed by the 

traditional understanding of contribution and by 

Congress's explicit terms defining what it wants 

contribution claims to be. Even if you assume that in 

some sense Section 107 imposes liability on PRPs to 

other PRPs, it doesn't say what to do with that 

liability and how you litigate it. Section 113(f) is

how Congress explicitly, carefully addressed that 

question and when Congress has done so this Court 

normally assumes that what Congress specifically said as 

the remedy and delineated as the remedy, including the 

limitations thereon, are what apply.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not worried 

about any of that when you're dealing with an innocent 

party, the person you say can bring this action under 

107(4)(b). Don't all those same concerns and objections 

apply in that case as well?

 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because the 

normal rule in American law is that innocent victims get 

to sue the people who have injured them for recovery, 

but the defendants, the liable parties, don't get to sue 

each other except in contribution when it has been made 

available.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't know, 

you don't know, that you're dealing with an innocent 

party until the end of the litigation.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, that might be true in 

many circumstances, Your Honor. But that doesn't mean 

that we don't give someone who can establish they are 

innocent party a right to full recovery and someone who 

is not an innocent party is relegated to contribution.

example of an innocent party who can bring an action 

under 107(4)(b) other than a governmental subdivision?

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. A party who 

qualifies, who can show that under the third party 

defense the hazardous release was not due to any, any 

fault of their own, and can satisfy the requirements of 

that defense.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they're somehow 

affected by the hazardous release.

 MR. HUNGAR: I'm sorry?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they're still 

somehow affected by the hazardous release.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, yes. They could be a 

subsequent owner, for example, under the bona fide 

purchaser exemption or the third party exemption.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But my point is that 

subsequent owner, EPA is going to start looking at him 

as a PRP, not as an innocent party. In other words, 

there is going to have to be an awful lot of litigation 

before he can establish that he is not a PRP and is 

instead an innocent, innocent party.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, they could also just 

resolve it through settlement, Your Honor. And either 

they could then proceed with their lawsuit or, if they 

want to admit some minimal liability and obtain a

contribution claim, they could proceed in that fashion. 

But there are solutions to the problems that have been 

identified under our interpretation, but there is no 

plausible solution to the problems that their 

interpretation produce, including eviscerating the 

settlement bar. It's no surprise that some of the 

largest polluters in America have lined up in support of 

this view, because this will allow them to reopen 

settlements and go after parties who thought they had 

paid up their liability and obtained settlement 

protection by virtue of the Section 113(f) settlement 

bar.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The person who settled, 

wouldn't that person be protected? Wouldn't the court 

say, this person has made a bargain with the EPA and 

we're not going to extract any more from them?

 MR. HUNGAR: Not if the claim is a cost 

recovery claim under Section 107, because section -- the 

settlement bar applies only to claims for contribution. 

This is Section 113(f)(2), which appears on page 9a of 

the appendix to our brief.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but to make the 

statute work in harmony, to harmonize 107 with 113, it 

seems to me that would be an altogether reasonable 

position for a court to take. If someone has settled

and is protected by virtue of that settlement, then when 

someone else tries to go after that same person the 

court could say: We have to make the statute work and 

we're going to honor the settlement.

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, I submit if the 

court were seeking go harmonize Sections 113 and 107 the 

way to do it would be to give effect to the limitations 

that Congress imposed on PRP remedies, but not merely 

the settlement bar, but also the requirement that 

actions be brought during or following civil actions and 

settlements, and also the statute of limitations, which 

the Respondent's theory would also permit them to evade.

 If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of 

my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF OWEN T. ARMSTRONG, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. ARMSTRONG: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 I would like to address the settlement bar. 

One thing that the Court should keep in mind is that a 

cost recovery action under 107(a)(4)(B) is an action for 

restitution. This is an equitable action. There is no

jury trial under CERCLA. The district court is sitting 

as a court of equity. And as Justice Ginsburg just 

pointed out, the court is empowered in any case, any 

107(a)(4)(B) case, to accord settlement protection to a 

settling party as a matter of equity. It may do that 

simply as a matter of equity or, as we pointed out in 

our brief, it may do so by virtue of a contribution 

counterclaim by the settling party.

 So the court, a district court, is empowered 

to give full protection to any party who has settled so 

long as the matters addressed a portion of 107 --

JUSTICE BREYER: How? I'm not so sure 

because -- unless you want to stipulate that that 

restitution -- if you want us to write in the opinion 

that in fact in a 107 action if one of the parties sued 

has entered into a settlement he shall have precisely 

the same protection from suit as if it were a 113 

action. Do you want to say that or not?

 MR. ARMSTRONG: Well, Your Honor, I believe 

the district court as a matter of equity should accord 

in most cases -- now there may be exceptions --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I would worry about 

the equity. I just want to know if you want to 

stipulate that that's the proper interpretation, because

beautiful golf course and he wants to turn it into a 

golf course. Unfortunately, there's a little mess under 

there and he spends $10 million on that. And he says 

the real fault is the Union Oil Company and I'm going to 

sue them because they're the ones who dumped this and 

they've cost me $9 million. And it turns out that Union 

through precisely good luck and a brilliant attorney has 

settled this very matter for one dollar with EPA. 

Barred?

 MR. ARMSTRONG: No, Your Honor, it would not 

be barred in that case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, that's what I thought, 

and that's what he's saying. That's what he's saying, 

that's why he has brought his second acorn, because he 

said there's a huge difference here. What you will do 

is if you get this 107 action you'll argue to the court 

as to what's fair, but what 113 says is once you settle 

with the Federal Government you're home free.

 MR. ARMSTRONG: Well, Your Honor, in your 

hypothetical, spending one dollar, there is no question 

that the court sitting in equity and also as a matter of 

a contribution counterclaim would be entitled to review 

the settlement and if that matter is in the matters 

addressed, if it has been resolved by the Government --

and I should point out that in a settlement, settlements

are publicly noticed, so parties have an opportunity to 

object to any settlement which they feel is unfair. And 

presumably our golf course owner would be identified in 

that circumstance.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there's 

nothing, there's nothing unnecessarily unfair. It turns 

out that the Union Oil Company is bankrupt and in part 

of the settlement they agreed to turn over all the 

documents listing whoever it was that gave them the 

chemicals. And it's a very complicated thing because 

we're dealing with people often in these cases that 

don't have assets and only limited responsible parties 

have the assets. So they're trying to recover what they 

can from the others.

 MR. ARMSTRONG: That is correct, Your Honor. 

That would not be unfair any more than it would be 

unfair in a contribution action, in which case the court 

is directed to apply principles of equity in allocating 

responsibility.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, almost by definition 

a settlement is for the full amount that you'd have to 

spend without the settlement, almost by definition.

 MR. ARMSTRONG: Well, that is correct, Your 

Honor.

for 100 percent of your liability.

 MR. ARMSTRONG: That is correct, and I think 

Congress did write that into the contribution part of 

the statute --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that means that in 

every settlement agreement you'd have to engage in this 

analysis to see whether or not it was fair.

 MR. ARMSTRONG: Well, I believe in every 

settlement agreement the court would have to engage in 

an analysis as to what matters addressed are for 

purposes of the settlement.

 JUSTICE BREYER: How are you going to choose 

this? Because he is, I think you're -- maybe you're in 

a slightly awkward position because the Government is 

saying that one of the reasons that you're stuck with 

113 is because Congress didn't really want through 107 

to give parties like your clients an opportunity to 

review for fairness or equitable principles, whatever 

you like, the settlements that had taken place with the 

defendant in EPA. And that's so we can get people to 

settle, among other things. They feel they're home 

free.

 Now, you have two choices here. I think you 

could say, one, well, that's the way it is, we should 

have a 107 action and we should review these settlements

for fairness; or two, you could say one of the 

principles of fairness is the principle that's written 

into 113 about no review, and we're happy with reading 

that into 107. So which is it that you would like to 

say?

 MR. ARMSTRONG: Well, Your Honor, that's 

absolutely true, because I think one of the principles 

of fairness is to solidify the settlement agreement.

 JUSTICE BREYER: When you say that's 

absolutely true, you mean absolutely true that you have 

that choice, or is it --

MR. ARMSTRONG: I believe that a reviewing 

court should in each instance -- if a district court 

decides to avoid the settlement, if it says that it's 

not fair, I believe that would undercut the finality of 

a settlement so long as it's contained within the 

matters addressed.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, so then he's 

wrong in thinking that the motivating force behind this 

action is to permit people to get equitable review of 

prior settlements? What you simply want -- and you're 

not interested in that; you'll go with no equitable 

review of private settlements. Read 113 into it. You 

want the right to bring the case where there has no 

settlement and Government has done nothing.

that.

other polluter or the other in this case, where the 

other polluter is not someone who is going to settle 

because it's the Government itself --

MR. ARMSTRONG: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So I don't think you're 

in a position to concede anything one way or another 

because that's not your case.

 MR. ARMSTRONG: That is correct, Your Honor, 

because in our case, I think as we have made it quite 

clear, all we are seeking in this case is to recover a 

proportion of our response costs. We cannot conceive, 

because we are not confronted with the issue that has 

been posed -- I would not object as a matter of a bright 

line rule if the Court were to rule that a settlement is 

protected from a back end or a roundabout 107(a)(4)(B) 

action in order to disturb a settlement agreement. We 

do not have those circumstances in this case, that is 

correct. And we are only seeking restitution in our 

case. We are seeking an equitable result, a 

proportionate share of ARC's response costs.

Government's concern that prenups shouldn't go on 

unsupervised. That's when EPA brings an enforcement 

action, there's a monitor there. When there's a 

settlement, then the Government is there. But if you 

just go off on your own and do this, you're doing it 

unsupervised by any State authority, any Federal 

authority, and that could --

MR. ARMSTRONG: Your Honor, I believe in 

most cases there is State involvement. There is in the 

ARC case, although it is not in the record. We have 

entered into a cooperative relationship with the State 

in cleaning up the site. And I think in almost every 

case a PRP is well advised to bring in experts to make 

sure that the cleanup is consistent with the national 

contingency plan, because absent that, satisfying that 

requirement, the PRP is not entitled to recover any of 

its costs. So there is a very demanding requirement 

written into CERCLA. The national contingency plan 

occupies 9605 and it occupies several hundred pages of 

40 C.F.R. part 300.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As you read the 

statute, you're talking about a PRP, but any other 

person doesn't have to be a PRP, does it?

company that cleans up these sites, right, and go 

traveling around the country and clean them up and then 

send people a bill and cite your reading of 1074(b), 

right?

 MR. ARMSTRONG: 107(a)(4)(B) would include 

both PRPs and what we might call non-PRPs. I believe 

one of the amicus parties studies 364 cases between the 

years of 1995 and 2000 and there was one case out of 

that 364 that involved precisely your hypothetical, Your 

Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if we rule in 

your favor presumably there will be a lot more, right?

 MR. ARMSTRONG: PRPs will certainly be able 

to seek cost recovery under 107(a)(4)(B).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about non-PRPs?

 MR. ARMSTRONG: There are very few non-PRPs. 

The only non-PRPs that I can think of is perhaps the 

hypothetical you just advanced, because as has been 

pointed out, the so-called innocent adjoining landowner 

is a PRP, is a covered person under 107(a)(4)(b), and 

only has a defense to liability. And it is absolutely 

true that in order to bring an action, according to the 

Government, that particular PRP would have to establish 

through affirmative action that it's -- that it

satisfies the, the liability exclusion in 107(b). And 

that is a very drawn out process. The criteria for 

satisfying the defense in 107(b) takes up 2 1/2 pages of 

the, of the statute.

 So what we are involved in in that case, 

Your Honor, is yes, PRPs may bring cost recovery 

actions. And I think that was true in 1980 when the 

statute was passed. Contrary to the Government's 

representation, there are 10 cases holding that actions 

may be brought under 107(a)(4)(b) by so-called PRPs 

between the time that CERCLA was passed in 1980 and the 

amendment to CERCLA in 1986, in October of 1986. Courts 

held without exception, without exception, that covered 

persons or PRPs indeed do have a right to bring a cost 

recovery action under 107(a)(4)(b).

 And Congress when it passed 113, was looking 

at those cases only that had some doubt about whether 

contribution could also be brought. In other words, 

whether a party could seek restitution despite the fact 

that it was compelled to do a cleanup via a lawsuit. 

And some courts found that there was an implied right to 

contribution, some found that there was a common law 

right, but Congress in 1986 specifically said, we are 

only concerned with the implied right to contribution, 

given this Court's holding in the Northwest Airlines

case and in Texas Industries. Congress was concerned 

that there would be no right to contribution unless it 

codified that right, which it did in 1986. And I think 

the legislative history makes it quite clear that 

Congress did not intend to disturb or to cut back on the 

rights that courts had found consistently in that 

six-year window between 1980 and 1986, all of which held 

that PRPs indeed do have a right to bring cost recovery 

actions.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But in -- in response to 

your -- going back to your response to Justice Breyer, I 

take it the -- the right under -- under 107 was affected 

to the extent, or at least you would agree that it was 

affected to the extent that if there is a settlement 

they are home free and there can't be a 107 action; is 

that correct?

 MR. ARMSTRONG: That is correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So it disturbed the 

old scheme to that extent.

 MR. ARMSTRONG: It did, although most of 

these cases I do believe did not involve settlements, 

but I think obviously when Congress enacted 113, I think 

it certainly wanted to encourage settlements in cases 

where there had been an action brought against a PRP. 

Obviously I think settlement saves everybody the time

and effort of litigating these matters, and I think for 

that reason, in 113 we get contribution protection, we 

get the ability to bring a contribution action. So 

certainly settlement was a key element of 113 but it was 

a key element of that provision, not Section 107.  But I 

think Congress has made it quite clear to encourage 

settlements, if it's in the matters addressed, that 

there should be immunity for those parties that are 

settling their claims with the Government or a State in 

a judicially approved or administratively approved 

settlement. So I don't believe --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the 

disincentive to settlement? You just said how important 

settlement was, or what a good thing it is to encourage 

it. But the Government says if you could just clean up 

without any order and without making any proposed 

settlement, just do it and get back your costs, then 

there's a powerful disincentive to settle.

 MR. ARMSTRONG: Well, Your Honor, I think 

once again, settling is not a disincentive in the sense 

that if you do settle, you are deemed -- all of your 

costs are deemed to be consistent with the national 

contingency plan. You need not be concerned in that 

particular case about satisfying the burden of proof 

that you have as a PRP that your costs are consistent

with the national contingency plan, which is no easy 

matter. The national contingency plan as I stated, 

appearing in 40 C.F.R., part 300, occupies a good 

hundred pages. It is a very detailed and demanding set 

of requirements. So there is a strong incentive, I 

still believe, for parties to settle because in such a 

case they do not have to establish that there is 

consistency with the national contingency plan.

 They also obtain immunity from suits, 

assuming it's in the matters addressed. Now a party 

that voluntarily remediates a site has to worry about 

both of these elements. It can be sued. It has no 

immunity. It is certainly subject to being sued by 

another PRP, by a State, an Indian tribe, or the 

Government, regardless of how much or how well it's done 

in remediating a site, whereas a settlement gives that 

protection to a PRP.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you say there are two 

factors which still exert pressure to settle. One is 

that you don't have to bear the burden of showing that 

you conform with the national contingency plan, and 

second, that --

MR. ARMSTRONG: The second factor is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you insulate yourself 

from contribution suits by other people.

MR. ARMSTRONG: That is correct, Your Honor. 

That is absolutely correct. Because in cleaning up a 

site, you can clean up all or part of a site. That's 

what 113(f)(3)(b) states.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you rely at all on -- in 

9607(a)(b)? It says any other necessary costs of 

response incurred by any other person. Does the word 

"any" add anything to your case? Do you think it urges 

us to give the broadest possible interpretation to other 

person?

 MR. ARMSTRONG: I believe it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Other necessary costs?

 MR. ARMSTRONG: I believe it does, Your 

Honor. I mean, I can't imagine language more broad than 

that. I do believe the first use of the word other that 

opposing counsel referred to is to make it quite clear 

that there can't be a duplication of liability. 

Obviously a PRP that is exposed to liability in a case 

cannot be required to pay both the Government and the 

other party who is cleaning up the site.

 And I would say that the second use of the 

word other, which has become quite critical in the 

Government's argument, the Government I think concedes 

that the way the statute initially read in the first 

draft omitted the term other and simply read any person.

And the Government says well, the insertion of the word 

other prior to the enactment of CERCLA indicates that 

what Congress intended was to withdraw from that huge 

basket, if you will, all PRPs. Well, that is not the 

case at all, because initially the definition section of 

person that was contained in the initial draft of CERCLA 

did not include the United States. It cross-referenced 

the Clean Water Act. So the United States was not a 

person within the initial draft.

 And the addition of the word other, the 

second other in 107(a)(4)(b) was to make it clear. 

Otherwise, you're going to have a statute that says the 

government can recover under (a)(4)(a) and (a)(4)(b). 

So I do believe that the addition of the second word 

other simply explained and clarified that the Government 

was to bring its action under 107(a)(4)(a), not under 

107(a)(4)(b).

 And I think as Justice Scalia has mentioned 

before, it would be very odd for Congress to have so 

drastically changed CERCLA by inserting the word other 

without any commentary whatsoever. There was a good 

deal of debate about the exclusion of joint and several 

liability under CERCLA, about the exclusion of 

contribution, and other matters. There was not a 

mention made of the addition of the word other preceding

person in 107(a)(4)(b).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now you say this very 

language that's in 107 now had been interpreted 

unanimously by the courts?

 MR. ARMSTRONG: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So that part of your case 

is that, is to say that it's limited by 113 is to say 

that there's been an implied repeal.

 MR. ARMSTRONG: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless all those cases were 

wrong.

 MR. ARMSTRONG: That is absolutely correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's not just a 

legislative history point you're making, it's not just a 

point as to what Congress's expectations were. It's 

also -- it's also a point that relates to implicit 

repeal.

 MR. ARMSTRONG: It would be tantamount to a 

repeal.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And if the Government's 

only strong point is that 113 is meant to coerce 

settlement, and 113 didn't exist before, then it must be 

very clear that previously 107 did give them a cause of 

action.

 MR. ARMSTRONG: That is absolutely correct.

That logic is impeccable, Your Honor, I believe so. 

Because that -- that law was well established and there 

was no -- there was no such thing as contribution. 

There was no protection prior to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No acorns on the other 

side.

 MR. ARMSTRONG: No acorns.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just one 

question about your position on the remedial settlement 

provision in 113(f)(2)? Do you read it to provide not 

only immunity from contribution suits but from any other 

litigation whatsoever?

 MR. ARMSTRONG: No, Your Honor, it's not any 

other litigation whatsoever. I think that it is quite 

clear that what (f)(2) does provide is in a settlement, 

if a party is seeking under CERCLA -- now when you say 

other litigation, I assume you perhaps mean State law, 

etcetera. If it's a State law contribution claim, I 

believe that provision would afford immunity from a 

State law contribution claim, assuming it could be 

asserted. Now of course it could not be asserted 

against the United States. But I do believe that that 

language --

didn't really technically qualify as contribution, it 

would not, it would not provide a bar.

 MR. ARMSTRONG: If it were a CERCLA claim, 

Your Honor, under 107(a)(4)(b), it would. However, if 

it is not a claim based upon CERCLA, and there are 

certainly a myriad of claims that can be brought --

remember, CERCLA is a strict liability provision -- I 

don't believe that would bar all lawsuits entirely. 

That's correct, Your Honor. If there's nothing further

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY D. GECK

 MR. GECK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

May it please the Court:

 There are more than 400,000 sites across the 

country that are contaminated by hazardous wastes. The 

amici States recognize that if these sites are to be 

cleaned up, it's going to take the work of private 

parties. In turn, we recognize that private parties 

rely upon cost recovery to obtain their costs and 

financial incentives to do the site cleanup. The United

States argument ignores this vast majority of sites that 

do not have the opportunity of litigation and do not 

have the opportunity of settlement.

 I'll turn first to the words "any other 

person" where the United States argues that it means 

innocent person. The words "innocent person" are found 

nowhere in Section 107 of CERCLA. To get there, the 

United States borrows from other sections of CERCLA. If 

the word other were superfluous -- and we do not think 

it is, we do not think that's the right reading -- the 

better textual reading here is the natural reading of 

Section 107. These are two sections that are 

practically twins and if words are known by the company 

they keep, you have three parallel structures in each of 

these cost recovery sections.

 And further, we point out that the 

Government's argument leads to an implausible result. 

If people have to prove their innocence in order to 

qualify for a cost recovery claim, then there would be, 

indeed, a possible multiyear trial just in order to 

decide whether they had a right to cost recovery. A far 

better approach would be not to destroy a cost recovery 

claim after that work but to allow those issues, that is 

a plaintiff's potential liability under 107, to be 

raised as a contribution counterclaim. And that way you

have an incentive for settlement between that private 

plaintiff and the defendants, and that way you have 

equity being done.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't the States 

prefer to proceed, to force people to proceed under 113, 

so that the States would have, you know, a hand in 

deciding how the cleanup should go? I don't -- I don't 

quite understand why you're here. I would have thought 

that the States' interest would be similar to the 

Government's.

 MR. GECK: The States recognize that to 

proceed under settlement puts a near impossible task. 

EPA, of course, can settle very few sites, they have 

limited resources, and that's one of the reasons why we 

don't have settlements in many cases. And apparently 

they sometimes have disincentives for proceeding with a 

settlement because it would open the Government to a 

contribution claim. The States also have some other 

resource limits.

 The States in order to go into a settlement, 

and this is an important point, the Government is 

blurring the State settlement right here. It's 

referring to a cost recovery right which the States 

could seek under Section 107 of CERCLA, but there's a 

great deal of uncertainty as to whether a State

settlement that orders a cleanup would be a resolution 

of CERCLA liability, and a Second Circuit case from Con 

Edison that's pending before this Court discusses that 

at length. Uncertainty does not drive settlement.

 You asked a question, Justice Scalia, about 

other reasons why there are incentives for settlement, 

and I'd point out a third, fourth and fifth one. One, 

you do get to settle your claims that the Government is 

bringing against you, which is a powerful incentive to 

settle, to have peace with the Government in certainty. 

And then a further point is that you get no better 

remedy necessarily. There is no reason to walk away 

from the settlement with the Government, and I don't 

believe the Government can point to any examples where 

people have walked away from settlements in order to 

pursue 107 claims, because 107 doesn't necessarily lead 

to a windfall. If you're a liable person or potentially 

liable person, you're going to see your defendants raise 

your liability and they are going to interpose a 

cross-claim under Section 113.

 And finally --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that how it 

works? They would have to, if you bring a 107 action, 

the defendant has to bring his responsive action under 

113? Or is it as, I guess your friend had stated

earlier, equitable principles are going to lead to an 

allocation of responsibility under 107?

 MR. GECK: I would rely first on the textual 

basis, that any person can bring a cost recovery claim. 

And then the text in Section 113(f)(1) says that any 

person sued under Section 107 may bring their 

contribution claim against any other person. That would 

naturally include even the plaintiff in that claim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The last sentence of 

(f)(1), right?

 MR. GECK: The fifth sentence of (f)(1) is 

what I was referring to. Any person may seek 

contribution from -- and this is at 67a of the petition, 

and I believe it's 9a or 11a of the U.S. brief -- any 

person may seek contribution from any other person who 

is liable or potentially liable under Section 107 during 

or following the 107 action. A 113 action supplements 

the 107 action that the government is so concerned 

about.

 Turning then to the question that this would 

bypass contribution protection: As a threshold matter, 

that is an issue that is rooted in the language of 

Section 113(f)(2). It is not a signal as to how to 

interpret Section 107 itself, because there are a host 

of potential 107 actions that might come to bear that

the United States admits to and those actions could 

equally be posed. But more importantly perhaps is that 

because any person who does a settlement with the 

Government would raise their settlement either as a 

defense or as a counterclaim, as my colleague said, the 

court would have the authority under 113(f)(1), the 

third sentence, there to allocate and apportion 

responsibility among all liable persons. And at that 

point, if it had been a judicial settlement that would 

be very strong evidence that you had paid your 

proportionate share to the site.

 Furthermore, what the Government is 

overlooking is the settlements, there are a number of 

checks and balances on settlements. This is not a real 

world problem that the Government describing. The 

matters addressed, provision of the settlement that the 

EPA very carefully crafts, doesn't overreach. 

Occasionally it will, but when it does address an entire 

cleanup at a site that signals that the EPA is going to 

be in control of the cleanup for the remainder of the 

site and you're not going to have unknown parties coming 

in and entering a site.

 To do so would be in fact inconsistent 

with the national contingency plan and you would never 

make the elements of proving consistency with the

national consistency plan in triggering a 107 right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the meaning of that 

last sentence in (f)(1), "Nothing in this subsection 

shall diminish the right of any person to bring an 

action of contribution in the absence of a civil 

action," of a civil action under 9606 or 9607? What are 

they referring to.

 MR. GECK: Well, it clearly indicates that 

there is a savings for other contribution rights that 

may exist under other areas of law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: State law?

 MR. GECK: State law is certainly a 

possibility there and that would of course be a stronger 

indicator that you could give a broader reading to 

contribution protection under (f)(2) and that's what 

several courts have done. But the scope of whether a 

State law meets contribution protection has been debated 

in the courts and it's of course not before us today.

 In the end, the last and most important 

point is that the Government's construction not only 

bars cost recovery from potentially liable persons even 

an innocent person who reads Section 107 would not step 

forward. If you touch a site and you begin operating 

and moving waste -- and Mr. Chief Justice, your

come in and do cleanups. There is a good likelihood 

that they would be receiving a counterclaim that would 

say that they had operated the site and become a liable 

party. And that could litigate for years.

 So in the end, in the end of the case, the 

United States leaves no incentive for private cost 

recovery and there are 400,000 sites that do need 

cleanup, and Congress did contemplate there would be two 

cause of actions, one under 107 for cost recovery when 

people had incurred costs, and the other one would be 

for contribution when people had been sued or had 

settled their civil suit liability.

 If there is no further questions, thank you.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, in our view the EPA can't

 With respect to the implied repeal issue 

that was discussed, we disagree strongly with the 

assertion that there was this unanimous group of ten or 

some cases prior to 1986. In fact the cases were

you wouldn't have your principal argument, which is, you 

know, which is that the reason not to interpret 107 the 

way your friends on the other side want is that you're 

going to destroy the settlement provision of 113, which 

didn't use to exist. What argument would you make for 

having us read the word "other" in the what seems to me 

strange way you want?

position that they take, that they want to be able to 

sue for cost recovery and evade the settlement bar. 

Respondent of course doesn't make that argument because 

they don't have to in this case. But unless the Court 

imports the settlement bar into cost recovery actions, 

there's going to be this huge problem. And if the Court 

does import --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're missing my point. 

My point is the settlement bar didn't used to exist. So 

previously, whether the cases were split or not, there 

was -- your best argument for the proposition that 

107(a) does not permit suit did not exist.

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, as I understand the 

argument it's that there was this unanimous pre-1986 

body of law and it was completely clear and perfectly 

understood that there was this cause of action.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Assume it didn't exist. 

Assume that body of law didn't exist. But what would 

you have argued when somebody came in and said 107, this 

provision, includes PRPs? You may have argued -- your 

best argument would not have been available.

 MR. HUNGAR: But, Your Honor, the point is 

it was not clear in 1986 what this language meant and 

what the extent of the PRP rights were. Congress 

addressed that question. There is not a hint of a

suggestion in the legislative history that Congress was 

recognizing a PRP action under 107 independent of 

Section 113. Congress spoke to the question of PRPs 

suing and the only way it spoke to it explicitly was in 

Section 113. When Congress says that, this Court has 

said over and over again that when Congress speaks in an 

area of uncertainty, as in Fausto, as in Brock against 

North Dakota, as in the State of Vermont, is where the 

prior asserted right was not clearly established, was 

not authoritatively recognized, it's not an implied 

repeal question. It's a question of reconciling the 

statutes in a way that gives effect to the later 

statutes, a more specific statute.

 Which as here, Section 113, their 

interpretation gives effect to part of it because they 

say oh well, let's borrow a settlement bar to make it 

all work, but you can't do -- you can't do it that way. 

The Court rejected that very same approach in the Rancho 

Palos Verdes case from a couple of terms ago.

 We agree that you need to borrow the 

limitations of Section 113(f). You just need to borrow 

all of them, including the one that they can't satisfy, 

which is that Congress said for suits by PRPs against 

PRPs, just like is normally the case among joint tort 

feasors, it's a contribution suit and they have to wait

for a law suit or for a settlement, or some discharge of 

the liability. And that also avoids burdening the 

courts with the extremely time-consuming and costly and 

difficult question of assessing whether the NCP has been 

complied with, whether the costs comply with the 

national contingency plan. Because if they settled, 

then the expert agency has already had a chance to 

address that and the court doesn't need to get into it 

in anywhere near the same detail. Their approach is a 

recipe for burdening the Federal courts with claims that 

Congress did not clearly indicate should be there.

 If States want to provide contribution 

actions that allow these sorts of claims they can, and 

many States have done so, including Washington State, 

which is here. So parties can bring these claims in 

State court if they want to. They can get settlements 

from the States if they want to and are willing to pay 

the costs. So the burdens that they identify are not 

there. Implied repeal does not apply here and because 

of the uncertainty, as we indicated at pages 9 through 

10 of our reply brief and footnote 5, there was no 

unanimous widespread consensus among the Federal courts. 

This just hasn't come up very much, and the courts were 

divided. I'd also like to address -- thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,
