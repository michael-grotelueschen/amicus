3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

4 argument first this morning in Case No. 09-587, 

Harrington v. Richter. 

6  Mr. Colombo. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY J. COLOMBO 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. COLOMBO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  The California Supreme Court's denial of 

12 Respondent's ineffective counsel claim was entitled to 

13 the deferential review for reasonableness prescribed by 

14 28 U.S.C. section 2254(d). By its plain terms, nothing 

in 2254(d) requires a State court to render a reasoned 

16 or explained decision, nor is there anything in section 

17 2254(d) that would treat Strickland claims differently 

18 from any other Federal constitutional claim. 

19  Here, the Ninth Circuit failed to give the 

State court decision the proper deference -- indeed, 

21 double deference -- it was owed. Rather than applying 

22 this Court's proper -- excuse me -- clearly established 

23 Strickland standard, the court of appeals employed its 

24 own eccentric rule that essentially requires counsel to 

always consult with and present expert testimony in

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do -- how do we know 

3 that the -- the California court even reached that 

4 question? Because there was -- wasn't there a motion to 

deny review as -- as -- wasn't there a time bar question 

6 raised? 

7  MR. COLOMBO: There was a procedural bar 

8 that was argued in the informal opposition to the 

9 petition for writ of habeas corpus that had been 

requested by the California Supreme Court. It did not 

11 invoke that bar as a basis for denying relief. Under 

12 well-established -­

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, it said -- it 

14 just said denied on -- on the merits. And it's still 

not clear to me how to -- pardon me. It just said 

16 "denied"? 

17  MR. COLOMBO: Yes. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's still not clear to me 

19 how to distinguish that, between denied, deny -- do we 

say, when there's a one-line order, as in this case, 

21 where it says simply "deny," it is presumptively on the 

22 merits? I mean, how -- how do we interpret that? 

23  MR. COLOMBO: Yes. In fact, that is a 

24 well-settled and long-established practice, local 

practice. It's well-understood by not only the

3 decision in Harris v. Superior Court. 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then it is presumptively 

on the merits? 

6  MR. COLOMBO: Yes. 

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: They don't -- I mean, is 

8 that the way it's stated? Don't let me use my 

9 formulation. What's -- what's the State's formulation?

 MR. COLOMBO: The State's formulation is 

11 that the silent or so-called summary denial is on the 

12 merits, unless the State court indicates otherwise in -­

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, that can't be a Ninth 

14 Circuit rule. I mean, that has to depend upon each -­

each of the States in the Ninth Circuit, no? 

16  I mean, some State could -- could have a 

17 different rule, I assume. You're -- you're telling us, 

18 however, that California has that rule? 

19  MR. COLOMBO: Yes. And that rule, again, 

has been well-established -­

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But did -­

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if I'm on the 

23 California court and I have two choices -- one is to say 

24 denied, no explanation, as this case; the other is to 

say denied on the merits -- if I have those two options,

1 then why are they both on the merits? 

2  MR. COLOMBO: Again, because it has 

3 certainly been well-understood for at least three and a 

4 half decades that when the California Supreme Court 

renders a so-called silent denial, that it is on the 

6 merits unless the court ordered -­

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what is the leading 

8 California authority on that proposition? 

9  MR. COLOMBO: That would be In re Robbins, 

in which -­

14 brief, as well as in the reply brief.

2  MR. COLOMBO: I would submit that there is 

3 no substantive distinction between an order that simply 

4 reflects denied versus one that reflects denied on the 

merits. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They showed us the 

7 docket for that day -­

8  MR. COLOMBO: Yes. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- of the denial here, 

and there were different ones. If it's the same court 

11 taking action, why would they choose one over the other 

12 for particular cases? 

13  MR. COLOMBO: Well, I submit that there 

14 could be any number of reasons, and not the least of 

which this Court addressed itself in Carey v. Saffold, 

16 just a couple of terms ago. 

17  As the Court recognized, that sometimes the 

18 State court may choose to include the phrase "on the 

19 merits" to give a reviewing court an alternative basis 

for understanding why relief was denied, or to let, for 

21 example, a pro se petitioner, who are typically the ones 

22 that present petitions for writs of habeas corpus in the 

23 California Supreme Court, know that their case wasn't 

24 denied because of some mere procedural technicality, but 

because the claim itself was substantively meritless.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's what -­

2 that's feeding into your adversary's argument, that when 

3 the court does a summary denial, you don't know whether 

4 it's procedural or merits.

 That's his argument. You're adopting his 

6 argument? 

7  MR. COLOMBO: No. No. Our argument is that 

8 it's a long-settled, established question of local 

9 practice that when the California Supreme Court renders 

a -- a silent denial, simply says "petition for writ of 

11 habeas corpus denied," it is understood by the court's 

12 litigants, has been well-established for over three and 

13 a half decades: That is a merits decision. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what would the 

California Supreme Court do if they all agree that this 

16 application should be denied, but two of them think it's 

17 for a procedural bar -- timeliness -- and then others 

18 think it has no merit, and they say just "denied," but 

19 there's no majority for either one?

 MR. COLOMBO: In -- in that instance, then 

21 the claim would be presumed -- assuming that the court's 

22 order simply reflected "petition denied," again, it's 

23 well understood that that would be a denial on the 

24 merits.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though, in fact, it

1 wasn't? 

2  MR. COLOMBO: Well, we can't know that. In 

3 fact, it would be purely speculative to suggest that 

4 that's what the courts have done.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So we -- so there is that 

6 possibility -- even though there is that possibility, we 

7 should assume it was on the merits. 

8  What about -- I mean, you said this is three 

9 decades, but we are told that the California Supreme 

Court has this pattern of saying merits when it's on the 

11 merits; giving a citation, if it's a procedural bar to 

12 the -- a procedural fault; and when it says simply 

13 "denied," that's most likely that they couldn't all 

14 agree on a reason.

 MR. COLOMBO: Well, I would respectfully 

16 disagree with that suggestion, that because it simply 

17 says "denied" without including the phrase "on the 

18 merits," it's not a merits determination. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's what they 

would say if, in fact, they were divided, right? 

21  MR. COLOMBO: I'm sorry. What? 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: If, in fact, the court 

23 was divided, all agree that the petition should be 

24 denied, but there's no majority for any particular 

reason, merits or procedure, they -- they would say

1 "petition denied," right? 

2  MR. COLOMBO: Yes, if it's -- if it's a 

3 straight silent denial, and the -- the court doesn't 

4 invoke either a procedural bar to deny relief or forgo 

the procedural bar and find that the claims are 

6 substantively meritless in any event. 

7  What I submit that the silent denial simply 

8 means is the court didn't agree that there was a basis 

9 for invoking a procedural bar; the claims were 

meritless, and it simply orders the petition denied, 

11 which is, again, well-understood. It's a 

12 well-established practice in the -- in the State and 

13 Federal courts in California that those silent denials 

14 are merits determinations, which are entitled, then, to 

AEDPA deference under the statute. 

16  Even the Ninth Circuit, in the en banc 

17 decision in this case, recognized that the California 

18 Supreme Court's silent denial was a merits determination 

19 which it then had to review.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do -- does the court 

21 sometimes deny explicitly on procedural grounds? 

22  MR. COLOMBO: Yes. And when the court does 

23 that, it will reflect such in its orders. That's 

24 discussed in footnote 34 in the Robbins case, which we 

discuss in our brief in this Court.

1  The court says when it's going to invoke as 

2 a basis for denying relief on a Federal claim, it will 

3 indicate that in its order. If it's relying on a 

4 separate State procedural default, for example, if it's 

a successive petition of the claimant's previously 

6 raised on direct appeal or -­

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're saying that if 

8 it's on both grounds, if they agree with both the 

9 procedural and the merits ground, they may well just -­

just deny without any explanation? But if they deny 

11 only on the procedural ground, they will -- they will 

12 say it? 

13  MR. COLOMBO: Yes. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: All right.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If you looked back at a 

16 sample of the cases in which they have simply said 

17 "denied," would we find cases in which no procedural bar 

18 was raised by the State? 

19  MR. COLOMBO: I don't know the answer to 

that question, because I haven't researched to find out 

21 whether or not in any of those cases, like in this case, 

22 the California Supreme Court directed the Attorney 

23 General to file an informal opposition or some other 

24 pleading that would have addressed that question.

2 suggestion in Respondent's brief that that was done, I 

3 couldn't -- I couldn't guess on that. 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: Was there a procedural 

issue in this case before the California Supreme Court? 

6  MR. COLOMBO: Yes. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: What was that? 

8  MR. COLOMBO: A timeliness bar, among 

9 others.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What was the basis of 

11 that? 

12  MR. COLOMBO: That the claim of ineffective 

13 assistance could and should have been discovered at an 

14 earlier time than when it was presented to the 

California Supreme Court under California's timeliness 

16 rule, which would require that counsel present the claim 

17 of, in this case, ineffective assistance upon learning 

18 of the factual basis to support such a claim. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it took 14 months for 

this petition to be filed to the State court. Do you 

21 have cases that show whether those 14 months are 

22 presumptively unreasonable under California law? 

23  MR. COLOMBO: Yes. And that's basically the 

24 Clark case that's also discussed in our brief.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So there is great

1 validity, you think, to your timeliness -- so this 

2 timeliness claim. And despite that, you believe the 

3 silent denial was an adjudication on the merits. 

4  MR. COLOMBO: Yes, because I would submit 

that when the State argued that the claim was 

6 procedurally barred by reason of untimeliness and the 

7 State court did not invoke that as a bar to relief, it 

8 necessarily concluded that the claims were 

9 unmeritorious, because they otherwise could have been 

barred by a procedural bar, but they -­

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you just told me 

12 that if they -- if they agreed both with the procedural 

13 ground and the merits ground, they could issue just -­

14 just a denial without explanation.

 MR. COLOMBO: That's -­

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Now you're telling me 

17 that -- the opposite. 

18  MR. COLOMBO: If I said that, then I 

19 misspoke or perhaps I misunderstood the Court's 

question. 

21  What I'm suggesting is if the court invokes 

22 as a basis for denying a Federal claim a State 

23 procedural bar, it will reflect that in its order. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: That will always be in the 

order.

1  MR. COLOMBO: Yes. 

2  JUSTICE BREYER: But if, in this case, they 

3 did reject it on a procedural ground, and it was a 

4 reasonable ground that they applied consistently, then 

the Ninth Circuit or the Federal courts couldn't 

6 consider the claim at all; is that right? 

7  MR. COLOMBO: That's correct, assuming that 

8 the Federal courts agreed that the State bar wasn't -­

9  JUSTICE BREYER: If, in fact, the -- they 

are right, if in fact that the State was correct that 

11 this is procedurally barred -- they should have raised 

12 it earlier; they didn't -- and if that was correct and 

13 reasonable and proper under both Federal and State law, 

14 then you shouldn't be in this subject at all; is that 

right or not? 

16  MR. COLOMBO: Yes. That's correct. Yes. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: So, normally, to decide a 

18 matter on a substantive -- to have a presumption that 

19 they were deciding it substantively rather than 

procedurally will help a defendant, though not in this 

21 case. 

22  MR. COLOMBO: That's correct. 

23  JUSTICE ALITO: But you didn't raise -- you 

24 haven't argued that it's procedurally barred.

8 waived here. 

9  (Laughter.)

 MR. COLOMBO: Well, I'm not sure that -- we 

11 never invoked a procedural bar in the Federal court 

12 insofar as the presentation of these particular claims.

14 waived is the second question, or the first, which is 

the merits of the Strickland claim.

18 be a good point for you to switch to that. 

19  MR. COLOMBO: I would -- I would be pleased 

to discuss that with the Court. 

21  We have argued in our brief, and I think

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or did they say, in the 

7 circumstances of this case, given the nature of the 

8 issues, that consultation would have been effective? 

9  MR. COLOMBO: That is -- that certainly is 

one reading of the Ninth Circuit's opinion. I submit 

11 that the more correct reading, so to speak, would be if 

12 the Court looks at the language that the Ninth Circuit 

13 uses in -- in discussing this standard, they essentially 

14 say, since counsel should have reasonably expected the 

prosecution was going to present this forensic evidence, 

16 he should have not only investigated it, he should have 

17 consulted with experts. He should have presented them. 

18 And I think -­

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We could take issue with 

-- with the timing of that consultation, but let's 

21 assume that it turns out afterwards that if he had 

22 consulted an expert, that that expert would have told 

23 him that one of those blood spots absolutely had to be 

24 Klein's near the bedroom. You would have no quarrel

4 for the reasons -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You would say, even if 

6 the expert were to give that kind -- an expert would 

7 have given that kind of exculpatory information, that 

8 that would not have been ineffective? 

9  MR. COLOMBO: Let me start by saying this: 

First of all, we can't know and no one can ever know 

11 that Klein's, or Johnson's blood, for that matter, was 

12 in this blood pool that the Ninth Circuit -­

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not talking -­

14  MR. COLOMBO: -- focused its attention on.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I gave you a 

16 hypothetical different from the facts of this case. I 

17 take the Ninth Circuit to be saying, if you're in an 

18 area, and you are a lawyer, where you have no expertise 

19 and your case depends on a technical issue, it behooves 

you to at least talk to an expert to find out if you are 

21 on the right track. And if you fail to and you get 

22 something that's completely exculpatory, you're 

23 ineffective. 

24  So I posed the hypothetical: If an expert 

would have looked at all of these test results and said,

3 under that circumstance there would not have been 

4 ineffectiveness for the failure to consult with an 

expert? Is that what you are telling us? 

6  MR. COLOMBO: Yes. And the reason why I say 

7 that is because it's important to remember that the 

8 critical forensic evidence in this case, that the jury 

9 was -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You keep wanting to 

11 return to this case, and I respect why you want to, but 

12 I am positing a hypothetical that underlies, I think, 

13 the Ninth Circuit's point. 

14  MR. COLOMBO: In response -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It may well be in this 

16 case that the consultation would have resulted in no 

17 prejudice. That's different from whether it was 

18 effective to ignore a consultation. Those are two 

19 different questions.

 MR. COLOMBO: I suppose, accepting the 

21 Court's hypothetical as stated, that counsel was aware 

22 of and failed to consult with an expert knowing that 

23 that testimony would be presented, could be deemed 

24 deficient performance under -­

1 makes a difference whether the expert would have -­

2 would have helped or not? I mean, counsel has to make 

3 that decision of whether to call an expert ex ante, not 

4 ex post. I mean, you -- we shouldn't evaluate his 

decision on the basis of whether, even if it's a 

6 1,000-to-1 long shot, it turns out that that testimony 

7 would have been very successful. 

8  Don't we have to examine it ex ante before 

9 he knows what the result will be?

 MR. COLOMBO: Yes, and I think it's 

11 important to look at -- as this Court has described in 

12 the Strickland case itself, we have to view from 

13 counsel's perspective at that time. What did he know? 

14 What could he have reasonably expected the prosecution's 

evidence to be? How is he going to meet that evidence? 

16 What tactical or strategic choices -­

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, Justice Sotomayor's 

18 hypothetical would include the situation where he 

19 doesn't know that the prosecution is going to introduce 

any expert testimony. He knows that there is blood 

21 there. He should -- he should get his own expert, 

22 whether or not the prosecution uses one. Right? 

23  I mean, can it never be ineffective 

24 assistance not to call an expert where -- so long as the 

prosecution doesn't have one on the other side?

11 it's going to be fact-specific depending upon the kind 

12 of case. It may well be in a given case that forensic 

13 testimony would not be controverted, would not be 

14 disputed. It wouldn't be relevant, necessarily, to the 

defense. 

16  Let's say, for example, that there was no 

17 dispute that the person who committed the offense left 

18 DNA evidence at the crime scene, and it's clear that the 

19 DNA evidence suggests that the perpetrator was the 

defendant. Then the court -- then the defense attorney 

21 isn't going to profit by consulting an expert to dispute 

22 an indisputable issue. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't it the reality 

24 that sometimes the defense doesn't want to have an 

expert, because the expert may turn up findings that are

1 adverse for him, and it's better for the defense counsel 

2 to just leave things murky and argue to the jury that 

3 the State didn't produce the evidence, either? That's a 

4 perfectly legitimate strategy, isn't it?

 MR. COLOMBO: It is. And I think that in 

6 many instances that would -- that would inform a defense 

7 attorney's strategic choices as to how to present the 

8 defense in a given case.

13 there was ineffective assistance of counsel, even 

14 assuming there was, there would -- there would be no 

prejudice in this case. 

16  MR. COLOMBO: That's correct. Yes. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And could you just 

18 summarize why you say there would be no prejudice? 

19  MR. COLOMBO: Well, first of all, I think 

it's important to recognize that the expert declarations 

21 that were proffered by Respondent in support of his 

22 habeas petition really don't challenge the testimony 

23 that was presented in the State trial by the State's 

24 experts, specifically the question of whether or not the 

murder victim could have been moved from, supposedly,

1 the area outside the bedroom door onto the couch. 

2  The testimony at trial suggested that that 

3 distance was somewhere between about 20 and 25 feet. 

4 There was no evidence at the crime scene that suggested 

the victim had moved from the point where he was shot 

6 with a fatal gunshot wound. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the -- the 

8 pool of blood? There was one expert affidavit that said 

9 something about -- that Johnson, standing up, could not 

have produced that amount of blood. 

11  MR. COLOMBO: I think the actual expert 

12 declaration suggested that the prosecution's theory, as 

13 the expert described it, could be eliminated, because 

14 Johnson could not have bled into the blood pool 

sufficient to have formed it by merely standing and 

16 waiting for the police to arrive. 

17  I think it's important to realize the 

18 distinction between the prosecutor's theory which he 

19 propounded in his closing argument versus the evidence 

that the jury actually heard at trial from the State's 

21 own blood-spatter expert that suggested in order for -­

22 for Klein to have been moved from the point where the 

23 blood pool had formed onto the couch where his body was 

24 discovered by the police, there would have been some 

trail or some indicia, some evidence that would have

1 suggested that he had to have been moved from that 

2 point. 

3  And the more important question, I suppose, 

4 would be, as the dissenting opinion pointed out in this 

case: Why would the victim have been moved if he had 

6 been shot at that location? Why would he have been 

7 moved onto the couch? 

8  It certainly makes no sense for another 

9 victim, who's already shot, who's intoxicated, who's 

wounded and moving around in the house -- why would he 

11 have wanted to have moved the victim of the gunshot 

12 wound to the head from point A to point B? It just 

13 doesn't make any sense. And there has never been 

14 anything in any of Respondent's experts' declarations 

that suggests a rational explanation for how or why that 

16 could have happened. Without -­

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: On the -- on the no 

18 prejudice issue, are you relying just on what 

19 happened -- what was found at the scene of the crime? I 

mean, you said it's implausible that Klein would have 

21 been moved with no trail of blood at all. So, you say, 

22 therefore no prejudice. 

23  Any -- anything else that goes into your no 

24 prejudice argument?

 MR. COLOMBO: Yes. I think for all of the

1 reasons that are discussed in the dissenting opinion at 

2 pages 193a to 194a of the petition for writ of 

3 certiorari -- excuse me -- of the appendix. 

4  As the dissenting opinion points out, it 

certainly was -- there's no evidence in the various 

6 experts' declarations that suggests, first of all, why 

7 the jury would have believed Respondent's trial 

8 testimony that after having essentially partied with the 

9 two victims for several hours the night before, they 

suddenly leave, go back to their place of employment, 

11 come back two hours later to return property and a 

12 firearm to another occupant of the house that they had 

13 no reason to believe was actually there; then they are 

14 suddenly surprised by these two victims; that there is a 

spontaneous gunfight that ensues involving a firearm 

16 that's never found, that's never attributed to either of 

17 the two victims in the house, that could have only been 

18 attributable to the Respondent himself. 

19  So the jury had all of that evidence to 

consider, and we balance that against these -- as I, 

21 again, described them -- inconclusive and speculative 

22 expert opinions that are proffered in support of 

23 Respondent's habeas petition. The jury could not have 

24 been persuaded to find the defendant not guilty, even 

had that evidence been introduced.

4 was, in fact, available and could have been presented in 

this case at the time of Respondent's trial. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: Was there additional 

7 physical evidence found not at the scene? 

8  MR. COLOMBO: Yes. In fact, the -- the 

9 other thing that really tied the Respondent into this 

crime was that there was an expended casing at the crime 

11 scene that matched perfectly with a loaded firearm 

12 magazine with the exact same kind of bullets and a box 

13 full of the same exact bullets in the Respondent's house 

14 when the officer served a search warrant, along with the 

stolen gun safe and some evidence that there was 

16 marijuana there, which the victim -- the surviving 

17 victim was -- admitted to be a marijuana dealer. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you a question 

19 about California procedure?

 Is what happened here unusual? Is there -­

21 doesn't -- does the prosecution have an obligation to 

22 provide notice before trial of its intention to call 

23 expert witnesses?

23 AEDPA in this case, and in light of the Court's many 

24 questions this morning, I want to address that. But I 

did want to clear up one piece of information that seems

Official 

1 to be confusing in the record, and if I can start with 

2 that. 

3  This was in response, I think, to a question 

4 you asked, Justice Ginsburg, regarding the -- the 

prejudice prong of the Strickland claim. And the 

6 question was: Why is it -- why is it not -- why is it 

7 harmless? And counsel suggested that there was an 

8 absence of blood between the blood pool and the couch. 

9 Detective Bell testified to that.

 And I just want to clear up, because I know 

11 this -- this bit was confusing in the briefs, too: That 

12 is not what Detective Bell testified to. If you look at 

13 pages 181 and 195 in the reporter's transcript in 

14 Exhibit R5, you will see that Detective Bell says, yes, 

there were drops leading away from the couch; yes, there 

16 were drops leading away from the blood pool. 

17  And in fact, Exhibit R5 is a picture of the 

18 couch, and you can indeed see -­

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the point 

was that there was no trail from the bed. I mean, the 

21 theory was that Klein was removed from the bed to the 

22 couch. 

23  And I thought that the point that the -­

24 that counsel for the State emphasized was, did the -- if 

someone were moved from the bed, taken to the living

1 room couch, you would have expected to see a trail of 

2 blood from the bed. And there wasn't that. 

3  MR. GARDNER: Indeed. But the State's 

4 theory -- the defense theory was that the body had been 

moved from the blood pool -- not the bed -- the blood 

6 pool to the couch. And the State's response, in its 

7 briefing and today at oral argument, was that there was 

8 no blood trail between the blood pool and the couch. 

9 And, indeed, that's not what Detective Bell testified 

to. He said there were drops outside the blood pool, 

11 drops outside the couch, and when asked if there was 

12 blood in the carpeting in between, he said he did not 

13 remember how much blood there was in between. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so the idea is 

that Johnson drags Klein. This is your theory, right? 

16 Because you are not suggesting he could have lifted 

17 Klein and walked him over, are you? 

18  MR. GARDNER: Yes, I think he could have 

19 lifted him, Your Honor.

21 have an expert testify to that? 

22  MR. GARDNER: No.

24 testimony about that or an expert report about that?

7 and 160 pounds. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And Johnson? 

9  MR. GARDNER: I think about the same, Your 

Honor. 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. And you say 

12 that he could have dragged him from the pool to the

testimony and -- and the suggestion that there was no 

16 trail of blood between the blood pool and the couch is 

17 not consistent with what Detective Bell testified to. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. -­

about why he -- why Johnson would have a motive to go 

21 through this exertion? He's -- he's wounded. And let's 

22 say there really was a gun -- a gun fight, and Klein 

23 fell someplace else. Johnson wants to make it seem like 

24 Klein was -- that there wasn't any gun fight.

 Why -- why is it so valuable to him to move

2 to the couch? 

3  MR. GARDNER: Well, if he's -- if he falls 

4 in the bedroom doorway, Your Honor, and he falls in a 

crossfire, then Johnson is in some ways culpable. Now, 

6 we don't know what the extent of his culpability is, but 

7 if he's involved in firing the first shot, he is 

8 culpable. 

9  Putting Klein on the couch and having as 

State's theory that Klein is shot in cold blood on the 

11 couch eliminates his culpability, or at least eliminates 

12 the risk of it. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: But he could have -- if he's 

14 going to make up a story, he could have made up the 

story that Klein jumped up and he was shot without 

16 having engaged in any firing himself, and he fell 

17 wherever he fell. Putting him on the couch doesn't seem 

18 to -- unless I'm missing something and I wish you'd 

19 explain it -- doesn't seem to aid this purportedly false 

story very much. 

21  And if you weigh whatever benefit there is 

22 from that against the exertion of moving this guy, it 

23 doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense. But 

24 maybe there's something there that's not apparent.

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't he wipe up the 

blood? I mean, what -- what good is it to simply put 

6 him on the couch when you leave a pool of blood showing 

7 that that's where he was shot? 

8  MR. GARDNER: Yes, I don't doubt that in 

9 retrospect he could have come up with a better plan, 

Your Honor. 

11  (Laughter.) 

12  MR. GARDNER: But I do think it's important 

13 to realize that this plan, at least on its face and 

14 initially, in terms of his adrenaline response, is going 

to get him out of a crossfire scenario. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What other -­

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there's a lot 

18 of talk about the importance of this pool of blood, but 

19 as I read Detective Bell's testimony, he never posited 

-- or talks about how that pool was formed. Only your 

21 expert does that. 

22  What Bell does talk about, however, is that 

23 there's a high-velocity blood splatter in front of the 

24 couch and that the pooling of blood on Klein's face 

shows that he was shot there.

Official 

1  Your experts do nothing to refute that 

2 testimony, which was really the basis of -- of Bell's 

3 testimony. He had nothing to say about the pool of 

4 blood. He talked about why Klein was shot where he was 

shot. And there's no expert testimony to refute that. 

6  So how do you get past there being a 

7 reasonable probability of a different verdict when there 

8 is nothing to refute the critical testimony at issue, 

9 that Klein was shot where he was shot because there's 

high-velocity blood splatter in front of him and because 

11 the pooling on his face shows that? 

12  MR. GARDNER: Let's take both the 

13 high-velocity blood spatter and the pooling, Your Honor, 

14 but let me start with the predicate. And you are right, 

Detective Bell did not testify at all about the 

16 formation of the blood pool, and that's why this case 

17 isn't about anticipating a State's expert about the 

18 blood pool, but about getting your own for your own 

19 case.

 But turning to the specifics of your 

21 question, the high-velocity blood spatter. It actually 

22 wasn't in front of the couch, Your Honor. It was to the 

23 side and below the arm. And let's remember Detective 

24 Bell's testimony about how the homicide occurred, 

because the State's theory was not that Pat Klein was 

32
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 shot while he was lying on the couch, but that he was 

2 sitting on the couch. 

3  And so what's -- what's most interesting 

4 about the high-velocity blood spatter, since he's shot 

in the head, is that there is none on the wall 

6 immediately behind the couch. This was a matter of some 

7 confusion in the briefs as well, but I think it's been 

8 cleared up. There's no high-velocity blood spatter 

9 behind, on the pristine white wall.

 So the question is: If he's shot while 

11 sitting up, the high-velocity blood spatter that Bell 

12 testifies to travels, oh, about 4 feet over the couch, 

13 and then two drops sink down. Now, in terms of the jury 

14 evaluating that testimony, it's important to note that 

Detective Bell gave a description of what high-velocity 

16 blood spatter is, and he said it's a fan-like pattern of 

17 atomized blood. And when you look at these two drops, 

18 these two drops alone that travel 4 feet and then drop 

19 straight down to fall on a plastic bag, you see, as 

defense counsel pointed out in his closing argument, 

21 that they are the same size as blood drops found in the 

22 kitchen on Exhibits R18 to R22. 

23  And Detective Bell's entire theory for why 

24 these were high-velocity was their size. There was 

never any dispute that there was no shooting in the

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what other 

3 expert evidence should Richter's counsel have pursued 

4 before deciding upon his course of action in this case?

 Put aside the blood-spatter expert. What 

6 other experts did he need to consult? 

7  MR. GARDNER: Putting aside the 

8 blood-spatter issue -- and these were raised in the 

9 lower court but not addressed -- there were -- he 

promised the jury ballistics testimony as well, which he 

11 didn't produce. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. We have got a 

13 blood-spatter expert, a ballistics expert. Go on. 

14  I thought, in their habeas proceeding, you 

said he should have consulted a serologist and a 

16 pathologist. Okay, that's four. Why wouldn't he have 

17 wanted to talk to an expert on the effects of alcohol 

18 and drugs on people's different perceptions of the 

19 events?

 MR. GARDNER: Well, I think the chief reason 

21 is, is that that wasn't part of his theory. If you 

22 look -- and really, the guide to this, Your Honor, is 

23 defense counsel's own theory, because defense counsel 

24 stands up in opening statement and he promises the jury 

a theory. And the theory isn't you're going to hear two

1 stories, and you have to assess credibility. 

2  His theory, as he explained to the jury, was 

3 the physical evidence will show you Pat Klein was not 

4 shot on the couch.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, he had not received 

6 notice from the State that they were going to call any 

7 experts, so why wasn't it reasonable for him to assume 

8 they're not going to call any experts, they're not going 

9 to be able to pull experts out of their pocket in the 

midst of the trial, and the judge isn't going to allow 

11 them to do that without providing a -- without granting 

12 a recess? What seems to have happened here seems pretty 

13 unusual. 

14  MR. GARDNER: Well, if this case were about 

anticipating the State's decision to call an expert, I 

16 would agree, but it's not. And the reason it's not is 

17 because we have an insight into what defense counsel's 

18 theory of the case was before the State ever started its 

19 case, Your Honor. I mean -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the Ninth 

21 Circuit said that part of the ineffective assistance was 

22 failing to consult an expert in planning his defense and 

23 in preparing his defense, not simply responding to the 

24 State's expert in the middle of trial.

 MR. GARDNER: I agree, Your Honor, and if I

Official 

1 said something that sounded like I didn't, then I 

2 misspoke. My point is that that's exactly the theory. 

3 Once defense counsel decides on his defense -- in this 

4 case, I think he picked the right defense. He told the 

jury the physical evidence would prove Pat Klein wasn't 

6 on the couch, and he could have done that. 

7  But despite promising the jury that the 

8 physical evidence would prove this, he never consulted 

9 with someone. And once -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you explain the 

11 blood pooling in the face for me? You talked about the 

12 high-velocity, but -­

13  MR. GARDNER: Yes, I did. I didn't get back 

14 to that. Thank you, Your Honor.

 The testimony was, of course, about the 

16 blood pattern flow on the face. And when you read 

17 Detective Bell's testimony carefully, that testimony has 

18 nothing to do with where Pat Klein is shot. It has to 

19 do with the angle of his face after he's shot. So if 

he's shot on the bedroom -- in the bedroom doorway and 

21 falls and that's the angle, the blood flow would be the 

22 same. So it really -- the blood flow pattern really has 

23 little to do with where he was shot, but just the angle 

24 of his face.

 And getting back to the blood spatter

1 itself, the blood pool itself, what's interesting in 

2 this case now is that, even after all these years, the 

3 State has never disputed the fact that the absence of 

4 satellite drops means the State's theory is false.

 Gunner Johnson could not have deposited that 

6 blood, because there's no satellite drops, which means 

7 it had to come from another source. The only other 

8 source is Pat Klein. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did I understand you 

-- I just want to step back to the prior answer. 

11  You think what counsel did here would have 

12 been effective assistance but for exactly what he said 

13 in the opening statement? 

14  MR. GARDNER: If -- I'm sorry. If the 

question is, but for the opening statement, would we 

16 still have this argument, yes, although it would be much 

17 more difficult to establish what his theory was. The 

18 opening statement doesn't change the Strickland 

19 analysis. It simply gives us an insight, an easier path 

into knowing what counsel's theory was, much like -­

21 much like the case of Wiggins v. Smith, where the Court 

22 looked at defense counsel's opening statement in the 

23 penalty phase repeatedly to see what was his theory and 

24 what didn't he do. And when there was a suggestion made

thinking and when he was thinking it. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gardner, what about 

7 the argument that all this is beside the point because 

8 the argument for prejudice is so weak, given all the 

9 other evidence that Mr. Colombo referred to?

 MR. GARDNER: Well, it will come as no 

11 surprise to know that I disagree with that argument, 

12 Your Honor, and -- and for a couple of reasons. 

13  The -- the cases really came down to Gunner 

14 Johnson v. Petitioner Richter. Who was the jury going 

to believe? Even on the record that counsel has 

16 described, the jury deliberated 14 hours. And remember, 

17 that record included a surviving eyewitness, and if you 

18 believe the surviving eyewitness, the case is over. 

19  The jury deliberated over 14 hours, asking 

for reinstruction twice and a rereading of testimony 

21 three times. And I think there's good reason for that 

22 pause.

9 to the 9-1-1 people, they said: What happened? He 

said: Five people came in and shot me. Then he said 

11 four, then he said three. And when they said, Who, he 

12 said: I don't know. So clearly Gunner Johnson was a 

13 compromised witness, Your Honor. 

14  But the fact that the State has a 

compromised witness is not the reason not to research 

16 the physical evidence and enhance your client's 

17 credibility. It's more of a reason to do it. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do with the 

19 ammunition back at Richter's home, that the -- the gun 

safe is found there and the unlikely story about them 

21 going -- having the zeal to clean up their workplace and 

22 then coming back? 

23  MR. GARDNER: Well, let me take them one at 

24 a time, Your Honor. And in a sense, the ammo and the 

gun safe, the answer is -- is very similar. All parties

1 agreed in this case that several weeks before the 

2 incident, Gunner Johnson had stored all his belongings 

3 at my client's house. And, so, the only dispute was had 

4 the -- the gun safe included. And this is one of the 

unusual features, is that the State's theory requires us 

6 to believe that this happened so he could rob a gun safe 

7 that had been at his house for weeks. 

8  The question was had -- had the material, 

9 the gun safe and the ammo -- who's was it and had it 

been taken back to Gunner's house? The ammo is found in 

11 a place with two other things. It's found with a scale 

12 used for measuring drugs, and it's found with shotgun 

13 ammunition. 

14  Now, the record shows that Gunner Johnson 

had a shotgun, and Gunner Johnson was a drug dealer. So 

16 the defense theory, of course, is that this ammo wasn't 

17 my client's. It was Gunner Johnson's and hadn't been 

18 moved back. Similarly, as to the safe, there was 

19 conflicting testimony as to whether the safe had ever 

been moved back. 

21  So, that really is the explanation. And 

22 that, I think, is why the jury had such pause about this 

23 case when it heard the case. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean the case 

against Gunner you've just described, would it have been

1 enough, and wouldn't that have justified counsel's 

2 decision to focus on credibility rather than expert 

3 physical evidence? 

4  MR. GARDNER: I think not. And -- and -­

and we know this again for two reasons. And let me 

6 start by saying the fact is that when counsel was asked, 

7 that wasn't the reason he gave. It's not as if he -- he 

8 came to the depo and he said this was my tactical 

9 reason, and so we can say, okay, that's a reasonable 

tactical decision. That wasn't the decision -- reason 

11 he gave. 

12  When asked did you decide not to present or 

13 why didn't you present this blood-spatter testimony, he 

14 said I simply didn't know it was out there. And after 

all, let's keep in mind this was only his second 

16 trial -- his second murder trial. He didn't know what 

17 was out there. So, he didn't make that tactical 

18 decision. And that's the first reason. 

19  The second reason, I think, is that -- and 

almost every case that has ever addressed this -- and I 

21 have cited most of them -- has come to the same 

22 conclusion. When there is a credibility determination, 

23 when a defense -- any defense lawyer worth his salt 

24 knows that there's a credibility determination to be 

made, the jury is going to believe either this story or

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did -- did counsel 

have to investigate the other aspects? I mean, we're 

6 talking -- we're focusing on the scene where the 

7 shooting took place. Did he have to consider experts 

8 with respect to the bypass, where they threw the guns, 

9 Richter's apartment, the vehicle that was used? One 

thing counsel said is he thought about hiring a tire 

11 expert because of the vehicle. He has to look at the 

12 possibility of expert testimony affecting every aspect 

13 of the various scenes that were pertinent in this claim? 

14  MR. GARDNER: I don't believe so. And -- and 

the reason, again, comes back to the same focus this 

16 Court had in Wiggins, another failure-to-investigate 

17 case. What we know is that counsel suggested to the -­

18 told the jury in opening statement, this is about the 

19 physical evidence. The physical evidence will show 

this. 

21  When counsel -- when it's clear that that's 

22 counsel's position in a case, it's simply application of 

23 the Strickland test. It's unreasonable for counsel not 

24 to at least have investigated the physical evidence that 

he told the jury would show that Klein wasn't on the

3 happens -- I know you have an answer that that's not 

4 this case, but what -- what happens if the defendant 

tells his lawyer, look, I did it, I'm guilty? And the 

6 lawyer decides that the best thing to do is try to pin 

7 it on a guy whose nickname is Gunner? 

8  (Laughter.) 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does -- does -- what 

else is the lawyer supposed to do? He thinks no matter 

11 what -- what physical evidence is found, it's got to cut 

12 against his client because his client did it. 

13  MR. GARDNER: Well, in a situation where -­

14 where counsel's investigation will not be exposed to the 

prosecutor, and -- and there was questions before about 

16 how California procedure works. And, indeed, once you 

17 decide to name -- to call a witness, you name him and he 

18 becomes, you know, exposed through cross-examination and 

19 for investigation. But at least in terms of your 

private investigation of a case, the ABA standards are 

21 fairly clear that even an admission of guilt doesn't 

22 affect your ability or your obligation to investigate. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if -- if the expert 

24 says that the pool of blood all belonged to -- I guess 

it's Johnson, I certainly think ethically that you could

2  MR. GARDNER: I think ethically you couldn't

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. So, that's a 

reason why defense counsel in this case and, the Chief 

6 Justice puts, in many cases prefers not to have experts, 

7 just so they can punch holes in the State's case. 

8 That's a -- that's a legitimate strategy. And this 

9 counsel was very -- an adept cross-examiner. There's no 

doubt about that. 

11  MR. GARDNER: I -- I don't disagree, except 

12 that again we come back to the -- the notion from 

13 Wiggins, which is you can't defend a tactical judgment 

14 that wasn't made. And, in fact, when counsel was asked,

defense counsel exists irrespective of the client's 

6 statements to his lawyer. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: We've never adopted the ABA 

8 standards, have we?

understand that, Your Honor, but from practical 

16 experience, I will tell you the fact that a client 

17 admits to something doesn't mean he did it or she did 

18 it. That's the real world consequence we face as 

19 defense lawyers. Often our clients tell us things, and 

you can't always believe them, whether they say they're 

21 innocent or whether they say they're guilty.

23  And let me turn then to the AEDPA issues in

Supreme Court denied the petition for writ of habeas

1 corpus in my client's case with an order that said the 

2 petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied. That same 

3 day in five other cases, noncapital cases, the 

4 California Supreme Court denied the writ saying the 

petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied on the 

6 merits. And the State's position here today and in the 

7 briefing is that the Federal court should simply ignore 

8 that difference. And I don't believe that's the case 

9 for several reasons.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is your answer to 

11 the -- to -- to the representation that In re Robbins 

12 settled that when the California Supreme Court says just 

13 denied, it's on the merits? 

14  MR. GARDNER: Well, actually I agree and I 

disagree. In re Robbins does settle the matter from a 

16 State law perspective, but not as the Attorney General 

17 has suggested. In re Robbins says a few things. 

18  First, it says that when we deny a case on 

19 the merits, we add the phrase "on the merits."

 Then it says that when we find a procedural 

21 default, we cite to that default so that everyone knows. 

22  And then it says -- and this was in response 

23 to a question I think you asked, Justice Scalia -- they 

24 say a third thing. They say sometimes we'll find both, 

that it's meritless and it's defaulted, and we will say 

47

1 both. We will cite a default, and we will say it's 

2 denied on the merits as well, trusting that the Federal 

3 courts will give deference to -­

4  JUSTICE BREYER: But what they cite it for, 

actually, is they make a slightly different argument in 

6 their brief. They say going back to 1974, there are at 

7 least three cases in the Ninth Circuit that have said 

8 when the California Supreme Court says nothing, just 

9 denied, we take that as a decision to reach the Federal 

issue and deny it on the merits. 

11  Now, not in your case, but in most cases 

12 that will benefit a defendant, because it will avoid the 

13 question of whether there's an adequate and independent 

14 State ground of a procedural nature. So, what they're 

saying is that that's the Ninth Circuit's statement in 

16 three cases, and the California Supreme Court over a 

17 course of 30 years has never said to the contrary, which 

18 it had plenty of opportunity to do, and in other 

19 instances where the Ninth Circuit was wrong, it did do 

it. 

21  So, that, I think, is a fairly strong 

22 argument. Now, you're going to -- the only reason that 

23 you're not out of court on your own interpretation is 

24 because you'll say that the State waived the procedural 

issue. And then they'll come back and say so did you.

1  So, what -- what is your response to all 

2 that? 

3  MR. GARDNER: Well, I -- there's a whole 

4 bunch there, so let me see if I can -- if I can tease it 

out. It is true that the Ninth Circuit has had this 

6 process, this procedure for a long time, and, of course, 

7 it developed in a pre-AEDPA world, when the fact whether 

8 something was on the merits or not didn't really matter. 

9 The only question was, Was it defaulted? And if it was 

defaulted, it might bar Federal review. Whether it was 

11 on the merits was really irrelevant because, before 

12 2254(d), that really didn't matter. 

13  So that's where -- and I agree with the 

14 State -- that's where those cases come from. I don't 

believe, however, that the waiver argument is really 

16 implicated here, Your Honor. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, look, for example, in 

18 Hunter v. Aispuro -- they quote it as saying the 

19 following: The California Supreme Court's denial of a 

State habeas petition, quote, "without comment or 

21 citation constitutes, a decision on the merits of the 

22 Federal claims." End quote. And then they have three 

23 other cases roughly to the same effect. 

24  Now, what you're saying is that this Court 

should hold to the contrary, and by the way, in doing

1 that, we will bar many Federal habeas petitioners from 

2 the Federal courts, because what it will mean is that 

3 there is an adequate and independent State ground in 

4 case after case, which perhaps is an irrelevant feature. 

But, nonetheless, the silence of the California Supreme 

6 Court is significant, I think, when faced with those 

7 pretty clear interpretations of what their silence means 

8 by the Ninth Circuit. 

9  MR. GARDNER: Yes. And actually if the 

Ninth Circuit were the only voice in the fray, Your 

11 Honor, I think the argument would be stronger, but the 

12 Ninth Circuit's voice isn't the only voice in the fray, 

13 and that brings me to Ylst. In Ylst, of course, the 

14 Ninth -- and Ylst v. Nunnemaker is a case which is part 

and parcel of this history from the Ninth Circuit of 

16 saying silent denial is on the merits. 

17  In Ylst v. Nunnemaker that's exactly what 

18 the Ninth Circuit said. And it came to this Court, and 

19 the State actually argued that it wasn't on the merits. 

And, indeed, this Court held that you cannot tell from a 

21 silent denial whether it's on the merits or not. That's 

22 the first response, Your Honor, is that there are 

23 additional voices other than the Ninth Circuit. The 

24 second is that well after Hunter v. Aispuro comes the 

Robbins footnote and in the Robbins footnote -­

2 time with your reliance on that footnote because the 

3 very last paragraph of that footnote says when 

4 Respondent's asserts -- and I'm shortening the 

introductory line -- a State procedural bar and when 

6 nevertheless our order disposing of a habeas corpus 

7 position does not impose the proposed bar or bars as to 

8 that claim, that signifies that we have considered 

9 Respondent's assertion and have determined that the 

claim or subclaim is not barred on the procedural 

11 ground. 

12  MR. GARDNER: Yes. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the footnote itself 

14 says unless we invoke the procedural bar, we're not 

applying it. 

16  MR. GARDNER: I think that's right, Your 

17 Honor, but that's not the only thing the footnote says. 

18 The footnote says when we deny on the merits, we say on 

19 the merits; when we cite a procedural bar, we mean a 

bar; and if the State has raised a bar, as they did 

21 here, and we don't rely on it, that means we haven't 

22 relied on the procedural bar. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right.

that's exactly what this Court said in Ylst. You cannot 

6 tell because there are seven judges, there are different 

7 claims, there are different possibilities. That's why a 

8 silent denial is there in State court. It's

procedural default, Your Honor, under State law. There 

16 are many possible procedural defaults. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but you're -- you're 

18 positing that the only time they do not say either 

19 procedurally barred or on the merits is when they don't 

have a majority for either one?

been raised below. Two judges think it's both timely 

6 and it didn't need to be raised below, but it hasn't 

7 been pled with sufficient specificity, and one judge 

8 thinks it's improper on the merits. There's seven 

9 judges; they all believe it should be denied, but 

there's no majority for any position. 

11  There's no reason for the California Supreme 

12 Court -- and this is addressed more in the amicus brief 

13 by the California Academy of Appellate Lawyers. There's

to spend a day, two days debating it when all seven

particular procedural default?

2 didn't raise it to start with; we added the question. 

3  MR. COLOMBO: Yes, that's true. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it wasn't as if they 

were trying to get around their own waiver? 

6  MR. COLOMBO: No, I wouldn't suggest that 

7 Respondent's counsel was avoiding that. I'm suggesting 

8 that if this was a legitimately disputed question, it 

9 could have been addressed much earlier.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You've lost me. 

11 I thought you said -- I thought you said that they 

12 raised it in the brief in opposition to the petition for 

13 cert? 

14  MR. COLOMBO: No, it was not raised in the 

opposition to cert. It was not raised -- it was not 

16 presented until the merits brief -­

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Until the merits brief in 

18 opposition? 

19  MR. COLOMBO: Yes. I wanted, if I may, just 

touch a couple of points real quickly. On page 23 in 

21 footnote -- I believe it's 6 of our reply brief, there's 

22 a discussion about what the detective's testimony was in 

23 regard to this blood spatter near the couch where the -­

24 where the murder victim's body was found. I think it's 

important to remember Respondent's counsel talked about

1 whether or not this spatter would have been consistent 

2 with having been shot on the couch if there were blood 

3 spatter behind the armrest. 

4  What the detective testified to and what's 

described in our brief is the detective said because 

6 this was not a through-and-through exit wound -- that 

7 is, the bullet lodged in the victim's head -- that the 

8 spatter would have been what he described as back 

9 spatter, meaning the blood would have flown out from the 

victim's head outward, and that was consistent with what 

11 the evidence was at the crime scene that the detective 

12 observed when he was there after the murder was 

13 committed. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the drops 

between the blood pool and the couch? 

16  MR. COLOMBO: The detective described those 

17 as essentially insignificant, that they didn't reflect 

18 anything other than that someone was moving around in 

19 the house, which was consistent with what the crime 

scene investigators had discovered when they first 

21 responded to the 9-1-1 call from the -- Mr. Johnson to 

22 the police. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any reason not to 

24 do this? I'm just thinking from our point of view -- I 

mean, I think it's probably correct what you say:

1 Nobody mentioned a word about this procedural issue 

2 until the brief in opposition on the merits, not the 

3 cert brief. And the reason they did was perfectly 

4 legitimate: We'd asked the question.

 Well, if we were wrong to do that, could -­

6 and if we took the opinion as being a question of 

7 reasonable deference, et cetera, and went into it, is 

8 there anything -- any reason not to put in that opinion 

9 somewhere, given Ylst and given the Ninth Circuit, it 

would be helpful if the California Supreme Court, for 

11 future reference, explained what their practice does in 

12 fact mean, whether it's procedural or whether it's on 

13 the merits? 

14  MR. COLOMBO: I would submit that that would 

be helpful but unnecessary. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel, 

18 counsel. 

19  The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon at 11:05 a.m., the case in the 

21 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
