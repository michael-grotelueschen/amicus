JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument in number 

05-184, Hamdan against Rumsfeld. 

Mr. Katyal, you may proceed. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KATYAL 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. KATYAL: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court: 

We ask this Court to preserve the status quo to 

require that the President respect time-honored 

limitations on military commissions. These limits, placed 

in articles 21 and 36 of the Uniform Code of Military 

Justice, require no more than that the President try 

offenses that are, indeed, war crimes and to conduct 

trials according to the minimal procedural requirements of 

the UCMJ and the laws of war themselves. These limits do 

not represent any change in the way military commissions 

have historically operated. Rather, they reflect 

Congress's authority under the Define and Punish Clause to 

codify limits on commissions, limits that this Court has 

historically enforced to avoid presidential blank checks. 

And because this commission transgresses those limits, it 

should be struck down and the district court order 

reinstated.

 If I could turn to the jurisdictional matter for 

a few moments first. We believe that the DTA, while 

certainly not a model of clarity, does not divest this 

Court of jurisdiction, for four essential reasons. The 

first is that, if I could turn to the surreply at page --

the appendix at page 14(a), that contains the initial 

version of the bill that passed the Senate on November 

10th. And at 14(a) it says, on the effective-date 

provision, "The amendment made by paragraph 1," which is 

the jurisdiction-stripping provision, "shall apply to any 

application or other action that is pending on or after 

the date of enactment of this act." That language clearly 

attempted to strip courts of jurisdiction over Guantanamo 

claims. That language, however, was changed in the final 

version of the DTA, and the final version of the DTA is 

found at page 10(a) of the surreply. And that has the 

following as its effective date. It has two effective-

date provisions. 

The first one I want to start with is H(2), 

review of combatant status tribunal, CSRT, and military 

commission decisions, "Paragraphs 2 and 3 of subsection 

(e) shall apply with respect to any claim whose review is 

governed by one of such paragraphs and that is pending on 

or after the date of enactment of the Act." And then, 

there is a separate provision for the rest of the DTA, for

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where was that change made from 

the prior version? 

MR. KATYAL: The change was made between 

November 10th and November 15th. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but, I mean, what -- it 

was made in what house? Was it made by the conference 

committee? 

MR. KATYAL: It was made in the Senate. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It was made in the Senate. So 

the House presumably never saw the prior --

MR. KATYAL: That --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- language. 

MR. KATYAL: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the President, who signed 

this bill, never saw the prior language. 

MR. KATYAL: That is correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, why should we attribute to 

both the House and to the President a knowledge of the 

prior version of the legislation? 

MR. KATYAL: Well, because the language itself 

was, I think, the subject of an immense amount of debate. 

And, indeed, when the language was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: In the Senate. 

MR. KATYAL: In the Senate. And well-known.

And, indeed, you don't have to attribute any knowledge to 

the President. We have evidence in the record that the 

administration tried to change the language back to the 

original formulation. And, indeed, in the House, the 

chairman of one of the -- the vice chairman of the 

Conference Report said that the change in the language was 

in -- was -- the change in the language meant that it 

grandfathered pending cases such as this one. So, this is 

not an example of which we have to resort simply to the 

negative inference of Lindh. However, we do think that is 

the second reason for you to believe that this case is 

grandfathered under the existing DTA. 

JUSTICE ALITO: But isn't that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What, in addition to this 

case -- I mean, this case is pending in the U.S. Supreme 

Court. There are many cases pending in the district court 

when this law comes into effect. What about those cases? 

MR. KATYAL: We believe that, as the cosponsor 

said, on November 15th when they introduce the final 

version of the language, that all of those cases are 

grandfathered with respect to the H(1) effective-date 

provision and the E(1) jurisdiction-stripping provision. 

However, that still leaves in place the Government's main 

argument in the D.C. Circuit below, which is that the E(2) 

provision governing CSRT and final decisions, and the H(2)

provision governing final decisions of military-- final 

decisions of CSRTs, truncates all of the review that is 

currently in the D.C. Circuit. So, it's certainly plausible 

-- it's certainly possible, though it's not, of course, 

presented in this case, to read the DTA as truncating the vast 

majority of claims at Guantanamo in current pending cases. 

Of course, that isn't the issue before you here. 

The issue before you here is simply the Hamdan case, and 

there was -- and there was a strong -- the strong desire 

by the Congress not to interfere with this Court's 

traditionally exercised jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Please go over that again. I'm 

not -- I'm not sure I understood -- I understood your 

response. 

MR. KATYAL: Okay. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You say that it could be read 

to preclude cases in the lower courts, but not here. 

MR. KATYAL: That's right, cases in which there 

is a final CSRT decision; that is, that the Government's 

argument in the D.C. Circuit, Justice Scalia, is that 

there are two different ways in which the DTA truncated 

the review of Guantanamo cases. One is the claim that the 

jurisdiction-stripping provision applies to pending cases. 

That, we reject. That, we think the Senate rejected on 

November 15th when it passed the bill. The other is the

claim that the E(2) provision governing final decisions of 

CSRTs, which does, of course, apply to pending cases, as 

the plain text says, eliminates and truncates a vast --

majority of the detainees' claims. 

That is the provision --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Does that mean, in practical 

terms, that the -- that the -- that the other claims that 

are in the district court get transferred to the circuit, 

the circuit is bound by the limitations that you've just 

described, and, at the end of the day, the complaining 

parties in those cases can raise the question whether they 

-- whether Congress could properly have truncated them, as 

it did, but it's simply got to wait? 

MR. KATYAL: Absolutely. And --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. KATYAL: -- to be clear, that's not the 

position we're saying that is the DTA. That's not 

presented here. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: I realize --

MR. KATYAL: That's the issue --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

MR. KATYAL: -- below, in the D.C. Circuit. 

In addition, we believe that this statute 

doesn't fall within the Bruner Hallowell presumption that 

the Government seeks to -- seeks to use here, for a few

reasons. The first is, this is not a statute that is 

merely divesting a lower court of jurisdiction. Rather, 

it's a statute that alters substantive rights of Mr. 

Hamdan. In particular, as the Government itself says, it 

eliminates question 2, upon which certiorari was granted, 

which is compliance with the Geneva Conventions. In 

addition, it alters entirely what both courts below found, 

which is that Mr. Hamdan has a pretrial right, a right 

analogous to Abney versus United States, to bring his 

claim now, because he's challenging the jurisdiction of 

the tribunal. That pretrial right is something that 

mirrors -- that goes all the way back to the founding, in 

the early cases that this Court decided, on pretrial 

habeas. 

In addition, we believe that --

JUSTICE ALITO: Why does it -- why does it 

affect the scope of the review that he could get 

eventually? If there's a final decision, there can be 

review of whether the use of the standards or procedures 

that were used by the commission to reach a final decision 

is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United 

States? Why doesn't that encompass any claim that he 

might want to make later on? 

MR. KATYAL: Well, as the Government says, it 

does -- certainly does not encompass question 2, because

it eliminates the word "treaties." It's a change from the 

habeas corpus statute. More generally, it doesn't do two 

things. First, if that's the reading that the Government 

wants to give, well, then it essentially means that the --

that the President has the ability to block habeas corpus 

or post-DTA review for all time, because, Justice Alito, 

it doesn't turn on -- you can't walk into court right 

after you're convicted, under the DTA; you can only walk 

into court after a final decision. And a final decision 

requires the sign-off of the President of the United 

States. And so, effectively, this reading would give a 

litigant the ability to block Federal Court review for all 

time. 

JUSTICE ALITO: I mean, criminal litigation 

review after the final decision is the general rule. 

There generally is not any interlocutory -- any 

interlocutory appeal. And what you say could happen in 

any criminal case if you assume bad faith on the part of 

the people who are responsible for making the decisions 

along the way. They could delay indefinitely and postpone 

the entry of a final decision. 

MR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia -- Justice Alito, if 

this were a final -- if this were like a criminal 

proceeding, we wouldn't be here. The whole point of this 

is to say we're challenging the lawfulness of the tribunal

itself. This isn't a challenge to some decision that a 

court makes. This is a challenge to the court itself. 

And that's why it's different than the ordinary criminal 

context that you're positing. The ordinary criminal 

context you're positing -- and I'm thinking of a case like 

Schlesinger versus Councilman, a court-martial case --

what the Court has said is that it's the -- the predicate 

for abstention is the idea that Congress has fairly 

balanced the rights of both sides, an independent branch, 

and has -- and has made certain determinations. Here, 

none of that has happened. It's all been made by the 

executive. And the difference is crucial in military 

justice, because, as Justice Kennedy said for the Court in 

Loving, the framers harbored a deep distrust of military 

tribunals. And the thing that makes it different than the 

ordinary criminal context, the thing that, as this Court 

said, stops military justice from being lawless is the 

Congress of the United States setting clear limits on the 

use of military justice. 

Now, if those limits had been observed, if this 

Court -- if the military commission complied with the 

rules of courts-martial, we wouldn't be here. Our whole 

point is that they don't, and that it falls outside of the 

well-recognized abstention exception for courts-martial 

cases.

 In addition, we believe that to further -- to 

further on -- Justice Alito, on your point -- this Court 

has already said in the military commission context that a 

different rule applies. In Quirin, this Court rushed in 

to hear a military-commission challenge before the 

commission was over, and the reason why it did so was, it 

said that the public interest required adjudication of 

these issues. And the public interest is no less severe 

in that case than it is here. That is, this is a military 

commission that is literally unbounded by the laws, 

Constitution, and treaties of the United States. And if 

you adopt the Government's position here, it effectively 

replicates the blank check that this Court rejected in 

Hamdi. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I come back to Justice 

Alito's question as to what the normal procedure would be 

in criminal cases? Suppose you're -- you have a challenge 

to the makeup of the tribunal in a criminal case. Is it 

-- is it the normal practice that you would get to raise 

that challenge? Let's say one of the judges is 

disqualified for some other reason. Can you normally 

raise that challenge before the criminal case is filed? 

MR. KATYAL: I don't believe so. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, there would be nothing 

different in this situation, if you couldn't raise it

until it was final. 

MR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, everything is 

different about this. That is, in your posited 

hypothetical, there is some law that you know will govern 

that ultimate question about disqualification or whatever 

the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I know --

MR. KATYAL: -- the matter is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the merits of the 

issue. I'm just talking about the timing of the issue. 

MR. KATYAL: Well, I do think that there's an 

integral relationship to the -- between the two. That is, 

that the predicate for abstention has always been that 

Congress, or some other entity, has fairly balanced the 

rights of both sides. Here, you don't have that 

fundamental guarantee. Indeed, if you adopt the 

Government's reading here, the -- they have said that they 

want to try 75 military-commission cases or so in the 

first wave. You will then be left with 75 trials that 

take place without even the most basic question of what 

the parameters are that these commissions are to operate 

under. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, when you say Congress 

hasn't fairly balanced it, I mean, I guess that depends 

upon your reading of the statute. If, indeed, you read it

the way the Government reads it, they would assert that 

Congress did consider these military commissions and 

thought that it was okay to wait until they had completed 

their work before full review was provided. 

MR. KATYAL: But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's sort of a -- you 

know, a -- you're running in a circle. 

MR. KATYAL: Well, that's precisely, Justice 

Scalia, our argument, that I don't think one can consider 

the abstention claim -- and this is what I believe both 

courts below had held -- you can't consider the 

abstention claim without deciding the underlying merits. 

And if you believe that the -- that Congress has fairly 

balanced the rights and are compliant with the UCMJ and 

the like, then I don't think -- then you're reaching the 

merits, and there's no abstention holding. 

So, if I could turn to the merits -- the merits 

challenges. The first thing I'd like to discuss on -- is 

question number 1 and whether this military commission 

states a charge that violates the laws of war. And we 

believe it doesn't, for two essential reasons. 

First, the only charge in this case is one of 

conspiracy. And conspiracy has been rejected as a 

violation of the laws of war for -- in every tribunal to 

consider the issue since World War II. It has been

rejected in Nuremberg, it's been rejected in the Tokyo 

tribunals, it's been rejected in the international 

tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia, and, most 

importantly, it's been rejected by the Congress of the 

United States, in 1997 --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Katyal, will you help me? 

Where is the conspiracy charge in the papers? 

MR. KATYAL: The charge itself, Justice Stevens, 

is found at 63(a) of the Petition appendix. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay, thank you very much. 

MR. KATYAL: Sure. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And suppose you had a tribunal 

that was properly constituted, as you contend that it 

ought to be, and then the charge was conspiracy. Would 

the -- would the courts then have review before the trial 

proceeded? And let's assume that it's a conspiracy and 

some other charge. Is there some analog in ordinary 

criminal proceedings where you challenge, in advance, the 

validity of the charge? 

MR. KATYAL: Ordinarily, Justice Kennedy, the 

answer would be no, you wouldn't challenge the validity of 

the charge. And, indeed, I think Councilman itself is a 

-- is a case in which there was a charge at issue, and the 

question was subject-matter jurisdiction. 

The reason why this is different, however, is

twofold. First, the claim that Mr. Hamdan is making is 

that conspiracy itself falls entirely out of any 

authorization of Congress. In Councilman, the question 

was -- there was an article, article 134 of the UCMJ, 

which was a criminal statute, and it had been interpreted 

to punish drug dealing. And in the case the court said 

where -- this Court said, "We will defer as to whether the 

facts showed the requisite amount of drug dealing to 

violate the Uniform Code." 

Here, by contrast, Mr. Hamdan's claim is that 

the conspiracy charge falls entirely outside of the laws 

of war as a whole. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the tribunal interpret 

the conspiracy charge to mean joint enterprise, which 

would be closer, at least, to accepted practice in the 

international tribunals? 

MR. KATYAL: The charge itself is one of 

conspiracy. Joint enterprise is, itself, not an 

independent charge in international tribunals; so you can 

charge, for example, murder. And your theory, in an 

international tribunal, of how you get to murder is joint 

criminal enterprise. But you'd have to charge the 

underlying violation, itself. Here --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm still not sure why, if we 

think that there is merit to your argument that the

tribunal is not properly established anyway, that you --

we have to reach the conspiracy charge. 

MR. KATYAL: If you --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if we -- and if we think 

that you're wrong on that, I don't know why that court 

can't hear the conspiracy argument. 

MR. KATYAL: Well, there's two different 

reasons. The tribunal is not authorized, and that the 

charge doesn't state a violation. Now, even if we assume 

that the tribunal is authorized and that all of its 

microprocedures are authorized under the act of Congress, 

this -- allowing this charge, conspiracy, is to open the 

floodgates to give the President the ability to charge 

whatever he wants --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's --

MR. KATYAL: -- in a military commission. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Katyal, I mean, that's a 

good argument for -- from a broad policy, but isn't there 

a narrower reason? If we assume that the -- that the 

commission is properly established for some purpose, by 

definition that purpose is limited. We are not dealing 

here, as we would in the normal criminal case, with a 

court of general jurisdiction. If we're dealing with a 

court of general jurisdiction, we postpone claims like 

yours til the end, because we say the jurisdiction is so

broad, they probably had it. Maybe not, but we can wait. 

But in a -- in a -- in a court of limited jurisdiction, 

or a commission of limited jurisdiction, we can't indulge 

that presumption. And that's why, I thought, your claim 

that conspiracy is not cognizable can be raised at the 

beginning, because it's inseparable from the limited 

jurisdiction of the court. Am I off in left field? 

MR. KATYAL: You are --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Or do you like that answer. 

MR. KATYAL: -- absolutely correct, Justice --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. KATYAL: -- Souter. And, indeed, I would 

add to that that the conspiracy charge here, Justice 

Kennedy, is -- the problem with it is compounded by the 

fact that the tribunal itself is charging a violation of 

the laws of war, when the military commission has never 

operated to try violations of terrorism in stateless, 

territoryless conflicts. That is, it's not just the 

charge, but it's where the charge operates that we find so 

central, that the -- that there are two different things --

JUSTICE ALITO: But is it clear that the --

MR. KATYAL: -- there's two different problems. 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- charges against your client 

could not be amended? 

MR. KATYAL: They may be amended, yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Then why should we -- why should 

there be review, before trial, of a charge that could be

MR. KATYAL: Be- --

JUSTICE ALITO: There could be additional 

charges added by the time there's a final decision. 

MR. KATYAL: And the -- Justice Alito, the 

Government has had, essentially, now 4 years to get their 

charges together on Mr. Hamdan. At this point, that --

you know, what you have before you is the charge. And 

that -- and they've stuck with this charge, of conspiracy, 

which is not a violation of the laws of war. And, indeed, 

the -- and the -- it's not just conspiracy isn't, but that 

the commission is operating in totally uncharted waters, 

because it's charging a violation in a stateless, 

territoryless conflict, something as to which the full 

laws of war have never applied. 

Indeed, Justice Alito, all 10 people facing 

military commissions today, all 10 indictments charge 

conspiracy right now. Seven only charge conspiracy. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't this contrary to the way 

legal proceedings and appeals are normally handled? You 

have a -- essentially, a pretrial appeal concerning the 

validity of a charge that may not even be the final charge. 

MR. KATYAL: Not in -- not here, because, as, I

think, both courts below indicated, this case, and his 

challenge, falls very much like Abney versus United 

States. This is a challenge to the lawfulness of the 

underlying tribunal and the charge that's against him. 

Indeed, this Court, in Quirin, heard, as its first 

question, Does the charge state a violation of the laws of 

war? That was the first thing it said had to be asked. 

So, I think the -- what we are doing is applying 

nothing more than the settled practice that has always 

been the case with respect to military commissions. And 

it -- in -- the public interest here, again, just as in 

Quirin, I think, requires some limits placed on military 

commissions, Justice Alito, because, otherwise, if the 

Government's position is taken as the final word, it'll 

give the President the ability to essentially create that 

blank check, for years on end, render a final decision at 

some point, and then that final decision will then be 

subject to the truncated review procedures in the DTA, 

which I don't think is what Congress intended when they 

changed the language of the bill. Rather, I think what 

they did was intend that this Court would decide the basic 

-- apply the basic structural limits on military 

commissions that have always applied. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question about 

the charge? The charge is not just conspiracy in the

abstract, it's conspiracy to do specific things, one of 

which is attacking civilians and civilian objects. And is 

it clear that the commission would not have -- a military 

commission would not have jurisdiction to try a conspiracy 

to armed civilians in a war zone, for example? 

MR. KATYAL: It is clear, Justice Stevens. That 

is -- that is precisely what the international tribunals 

reject. Conspiracy is a standalone offense. One can 

charge, as a war crime, attacking civilians and the like, 

as a pure crime, but what you can't do is charge 

conspiracy. And, indeed, the Congress of the United 

States, in 1997, when they wrote the War Crimes Act, 

essentially made that conclusion, because they defined 

"war crimes" with incorporating a variety of treaties --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose that proof were 

to show that there was very substantial and knowing 

involvement rendering him basically an accomplice or a 

principal, but it was -- it was still found under 

conspiracy. Would international law violate that? 

MR. KATYAL: If the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Assume that he's been given 

notice of -- during the -- during the course of the 

proceedings as to what the charges specifically are as the 

proof is adduced. 

MR. KATYAL: Justice Kennedy, on this particular

point, on conspiracy, yes, if -- that you couldn't charge 

some other offense, like aiding and abetting, and 

transmute some conspiracy charge into that. Rather, the 

international law and the laws of the United States 

recognize you can prosecute him for aiding and abetting as 

a violation of whatever the specific underlying crime is, 

like murder or attacking civilians. What you can't do is 

use the standalone offense of conspiracy. And here's why. 

Because the standalone offense of conspiracy is rejected 

by international law, because it's too vague. And this 

Court has said that the test for a violation of the laws 

of war is when universal agreement and practice make it a 

violation. The world rejects conspiracy, because if it's 

adopted it allows so many individuals to get swept up 

within its net. 

Justice Kennedy, aiding and abetting requires 

a much closer relationship between the conduct and the 

individual offender. Conspiracy does not. And so, for 

example, under the Government's theory, a little old lady 

in Switzerland who donates money to al Qaeda, and that 

turns out to be a front for terrorist acts and so on,

 might be swept up within this broad definition of 

conspiracy. And that's why international law has so 

rejected the concept of conspiracy. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that wouldn't be --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me put it this way. 

If we were to find that the Geneva Convention or other 

settled principles of international law were controlling 

here, why couldn't we just remand to the D.C. Circuit and 

let it figure that out? Or let it -- have the tribunal 

figure it out, in the first instance, assuming the 

tribunal is properly authorized. 

MR. KATYAL: Well, it is the role of this Court 

to confine the tribunal to its lawful jurisdiction. 

That's what this Court held in Quirin. And that's what we 

think you should do here. The tribunal itself can't be 

the judge of its own jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose we told the D.C. 

Circuit that the Geneva Convention or some other body of 

international law controls, and just remand it for it 

to go into all these arguments? 

MR. KATYAL: Again, we think, at this point, 

that the public interest is best served by this Court 

saying that conspiracy doesn't violate -- to set some 

limits. After all, all -- everyone facing a military 

commission is facing this charge. Seven are only facing 

this charge. The Government wants to put 75 of these 

cases through. And it has taken 4 and a half years since 

the President's military order --

 MR. KATYAL: -- for this case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question? Supposing 

the charge had been slightly amended. Instead of saying, 

"The criminal purpose, and conspired and agreed with Osama 

bin Laden to commit the following offenses," it said, "It 

and Osama bin Laden attempted to -- aided and abetted in 

committing the following offenses." Would it then be --

violate the laws of war? 

MR. KATYAL: If the charge is the specific 

offenses themselves, not aiding and abetting, Justice 

Stevens --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, the specific offenses 

are attacking civilians and attacking civilian objects. 

MR. KATYAL: Yes, with respect to this 

particular claim about conspiracy, that would solve that 

problem. If you say the charge is attacking civilians, 

and your theory of proving it is aiding and abetting the 

murder or the attacking of civilians --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And then --

MR. KATYAL: -- yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- what if the trial judge who 

looked at the indictment or ruling on a motion to dismiss 

the indictment, or its equivalent at this time -- said, 

"Well, I'm going to construe these words 'conspired or 

agreed' as the substantial equivalent of 'aiding and

abetting.'" Would that let the charge stand? 

MR. KATYAL: That would mix apples and oranges, 

because "conspiracy" and "aiding and abetting" are two 

entirely different things. One is a standalone offense. 

And one is a theory of how to prove a violation --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the language is "conspired 

and agreed with." And "agreed with" is pretty close to 

"tried to do it himself." 

MR. KATYAL: It's not, Justice Stevens, because 

it requires a different level of participation, and the 

liability is entirely different. Because if conspiracy is 

accepted, you're accepting Pinkerton liability. That's 

what the Government's own charge said -- the Government's 

own instruction said, which means that Mr. Hamdan is 

liable for all the acts of 9/11 and everything al Qaeda 

has done. "Aiding and abetting," as you are saying, 

Justice Stevens, in your hypothetical, is a much more 

closely tethered theory of liability, requiring a higher 

level of individual culpability and a totally different 

level of punishment. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: As I recall the Sixth 

Amendment, you're entitled to know the charge against you. 

And you're saying that the charge of conspiracy is not 

the charge of aiding and abetting. 

MR. KATYAL: That is correct.

 If I could turn to a second argument for why we 

believe this military commission is impermissible, and 

that is that it defies the Uniform Code of Military 

Justice. The Uniform Code of Military Justice, in article 

36, sets minimal ground rules for military justice, writ 

large. And it says that the President can't act in ways 

that are contrary to, or inconsistent with, this chapter. 

As Judge Robertson found, already we know that has 

happened here. Mr. Hamdan has been kicked out of his 

criminal trial right at the get-go. And the Government's 

position is that they don't have to abide by the UCMJ, 

which is a further reason, of course, why we believe that 

abstention isn't appropriate, because it defies the rules 

set out by Congress. 

We're asking this Court to apply the minimal 

rules of the UCMJ to the military commissions that operate 

at Guantanamo Bay, because article 2 of the UCMJ has been 

extended, and its protections now extend to Guantanamo Bay 

and protect those who are detained there. And one of its 

protections is the right to be present, and that has been 

fundamentally violated by -- already. 

If I could --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You acknowledge the existence 

of things called commissions. Or don't you? 

MR. KATYAL: We do.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean --

MR. KATYAL: Absolutely. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the use of them if they 

have to follow all of the procedures required by the UCMJ? 

I mean, I thought that the whole object was to have a 

different procedure. 

MR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, that's what the 

Government would like you to believe. I don't think 

that's true. The historical relationship has been that 

military commissions in courts-martial follow the same 

procedures. That's what General Crowder said when he 

testified in 1916, and what this Court has quoted from his 

testimony. It's what every military treatise says. 

Now, to be clear, our position is not that 

military commissions must follow all the rules for courts-

martial. Not at all. They must require -- must follow 

the minimal baseline rules set in the Uniform Code of 

Military Justice by Congress. They can depart from the 

panoply of rules, the 867 pages of rules in the Manual for 

Courts-Martial, so long as they don't depart from the UCMJ 

itself. Congress has answered this question, Justice 

Scalia, in article 36, by saying the President does have a 

wide ability to depart from the rules, but he can't depart 

from the fundamentals of the UCMJ. And, indeed, that's 

what --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What fundamentals, other than

MR. KATYAL: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or is that it? 

MR. KATYAL: Well, we do believe that the --

that the entire panoply of UCMJ protection --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand --

MR. KATYAL: -- is involved. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the nature -- the 

appointing authority and so forth. But so far as the 

rights of the defendant at the proceeding --

MR. KATYAL: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- just right to be present? 

Is there a requirement of prompt convening of the 

proceedings? 

MR. KATYAL: Absolutely. There's an article 10 

right for speedy charges. There is also an article 67 

right for independent Court of Appeals for the Armed 

Forces review, which is something that is not guaranteed 

by this commission. And so -- and, indeed, was a 

predicate for this Court's abstention holding in 

Councilman. 

So, we do believe that there are -- that these 

fundamental rights apply. And, of course, this is just 

all, Justice Kennedy, default rules. If the -- if the

Congress wants to pass a law to exempt military 

commissions from article 36, that -- they are free to do 

so, and that will then be -- that'll then be --

JUSTICE BREYER: But if you have to --

MR. KATYAL: -- a separate case --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- approximately the same 

procedures, what's the point of having a military 

commission? I think that was implicit in Justice Scalia's 

question. So, if you go back -- Revolution, Seminoles, 

Modoc, Mexican War, World War II -- why have them? 

MR. KATYAL: Well, we had them before, because 

-- we had them before, because we couldn't find military 

court-martial jurisdiction. They were situations of 

absolute necessity. The reason was that the Articles of 

War, for one reason or another, didn't cover particular 

individuals. And, therefore, we needed to craft a 

separate procedure. But, whenever we did so, Justice 

Breyer, we always said that court-martial rules apply. 

In 1847, which is really the first instance of a 

military commission, because General Washington operated 

under statutory charges to try spying -- but in 1847, we 

applied court-martial rules by General Order Number 1. In 

the Civil War, we applied General Order Number 1 again, 

and it said that it would -- that we needed to apply to 

court-martial -- court-martial rules, because, otherwise,

abuses would arise. And, essentially, the worry is one of 

forum shopping, that you give the President the ability to 

pick a forum and define the rules. And that -- and that 

fundamentally open-ended authority is what I believe this 

Court rejected in Hamdi, and it's -- and when it rejected 

the blank check. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Katyal, you've addressed 

the Detainee Treatment act in its -- in its capacity as, 

arguably, removing jurisdiction. Might not the act also 

function as a retroactive approval of what the President 

has done? 

MR. KATYAL: Certainly, there's nothing in the 

text of the act itself -- and even -- I know this isn't 

relevant for you, but for other individuals on the Court 

-- there's nothing in the legislative history, or even the 

post -- even the brief filed by Senators Graham and Kyl, 

which suggest, in any way, that this was ratification. 

But suppose it were, Justice Scalia. Suppose it 

did ratify some sort of military commission. I don't 

believe that it authorized this military commission with 

this charge, conspiracy, in this conflict, a stateless, 

territoryless conflict, with these procedures, procedures 

that violate the UCMJ. 

So, it may be that they authorized something. 

But even that, I think, may be a bit hard, because, after

all, what they did was authorize, as Justice Alito said, 

certain challenges to military commissions. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think, as a minimum, 

that they authorized a military commission? 

MR. KATYAL: They -- I think it's perfectly --

well, it's a -- it's a -- it is a possible reading to say 

the DTA authorized some sort of military commission. The 

text doesn't say so. It is, of course, addressed to the 

jurisdiction of this Court, and not in any way to the --

to the -- to the -- to the underlying merits. 

I do think that the -- that there is a -- you 

know, a conceivable argument. However, the reason why I 

think this Court, if it did decide to reach that ultimate 

question, should reach it against the Government, is that 

that kind of back-door kind of -- you know, approval by 

inference has never been sufficient when it comes to 

authorizing military jurisdiction, in the most awesome 

powers of the Government, to dispense life imprisonment 

and death. That is, I think, a clearer statement would be 

required in this unique setting, because we aren't talking 

about, after all, minor things. We're talking about the 

most grave powers of our Government, the power to dispense 

life imprisonment and death. And I certainly don't think 

Congress, on the basis of a few hours of debate, intended 

to ratify this entire apparatus.

 If I could turn to question 2 and the Geneva 

Conventions, I'd like to start with Common Article 3 and 

its minimal baseline requirements that a regularly 

constituted court be set up, and one that dispense -- that 

affords the rights indispensable to civilized peoples. 

As Judge Williams found, below, that article 

does apply to Mr. Hamdan, and protects him. It's the most 

minimal rudimentary requirements that the United States 

Senate adhered to when it ratified the convention in 1955. 

And those requirements --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what you mean by 

"regularly constituted." In your brief, I gather you --

what you meant is that a court that was pre-existing. It 

doesn't necessarily mean that. It just -- it could mean 

one that was set up for the occasion, but was set up for 

the occasion by proper procedures. Wouldn't that be a 

"regularly constituted court"? 

MR. KATYAL: Well, I think the way that it has 

been interpreted, "regularly constituted court," is not an 

ad hoc court with ad hoc rules. So, that is to say, 

Justice Scalia, if they resuscitated --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, not ad hoc in 

that sense, "I'm creating one court for this defendant, 

another court for the other defendant," but setting up for

court. I don't think that, just because it's a new court, 

you can say that it's not a "regularly constituted court." 

MR. KATYAL: So long as it is, (a) independent 

of the executive, which is what it's been interpreted to 

be, and, (b) affords the rights known to civilized 

peoples. And here, we think this military commission 

strays from both of those -- both of those. It's not 

independent of the executive --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You've mentioned -- you've 

mentioned that the defendant has no right to appear before 

the tribunal. What are the other rights recognized by all 

civilized people that these tribunals do not guarantee? 

MR. KATYAL: So far, Justice Ginsburg, all that 

we have before -- you know, I think all that's happened is 

the right to be present. To look to what other rights are 

guaranteed by Common Article 3, you can look to Additional 

Protocol 1 of the Geneva Conventions, which specifies 

rights like appeal rights and the like. But they're the 

most minimal baseline rights. We're not talking about, 

you know, Miranda rights or something like that. We're 

talking about just a set of core ideas that every country 

on the world -- every country in the world is supposed to 

dispense when they create war-crimes trials. And, even 

that minimal standard, the Government says they don't want 

to apply here.

 And why we think this is enforceable is that Mr. 

Hamdan is being prosecuted in the name of the laws of war. 

And he has the right to invoke the Geneva Conventions 

defensively as a -- as a way to constrain the tribunal, to 

say that they can't --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: How do you want us to view his 

status? Do we accept the Government's submission that 

there's probable cause to believe that he was not of -- in 

a formal uniform, that he was not a formal combatant, but 

that he was aiding and abetting, or conspiring, with al 

Qaeda? Can we accept that, that there's probable cause 

for that? 

MR. KATYAL: No, Justice Kennedy, for two 

reasons. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, in -- particularly 

based on the CSRT hearing? 

MR. KATYAL: The CSRT, to my knowledge, never 

asked any of those --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you have to --

MR. KATYAL: -- questions about --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you have to give us --

MR. KATYAL: -- uniforms or --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- a beginning point. You 

have to give us a beginning point. 

MR. KATYAL: We would love a beginning point.

And the beginning point is an article 5 hearing, which is 

required by Army Regulation 190-8, in article 5 of the 

Geneva Conventions. The CSRT in no way suffices to do 

that. It didn't ask those questions about, Are -- you 

know, uniforms, and the like, to my knowledge. Of course, 

the CSRT isn't in the record, so we don't really know. 

The Government said, below, that it had, quote, "zero 

effect on this case," and didn't introduce it. 

But, be that as it may, suppose that the CSRT 

did decide that Mr. Hamdan is an enemy combatant. Justice 

Kennedy, most enemy combatants are prisoners of war. So, 

if anything, all the CSRT did was affirm Mr. Hamdan's 

separate claim, apart from Common Article 3, to the full 

protection of the Geneva Conventions. 

If I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And that would require a 

determination by a different tribunal that he was not a 

POW, in default of which he would be treated as a POW and 

be entitled to a court-martial? Is that the point?

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

MR. KATYAL: -- Souter. 

If I could reserve the balance of my time. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, you certainly may.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, and may it 

please the Court: 

The executive branch has long exercised the 

authority to try enemy combatants by military commissions. 

That authority was part and parcel of George Washington's 

authority as Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary 

Forces, as dramatically illustrated by the case of Major 

Andre. And that authority was incorporated into the 

Constitution. 

Congress has repeatedly recognized and 

sanctioned that authority. Indeed, each time Congress has 

extended the jurisdiction of the court-martials, Congress 

was at pains to emphasize that that extension did not come 

in derogation of the jurisdiction of military commissions. 

And in its most recent action, Congress clearly did not 

operate as somebody who viewed the military commissions as 

ultra vires. They offered no immediate review, and no 

review at all for charges resulting in a conviction of 

less than 10 years. 

Of course, even more clearly, Congress's most 

recent action made it clear that the courts no longer have 

jurisdiction over pre-enforcement challenges. And it's to 

that I'd like to turn first.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But let me just ask this 

question, Mr. Clement. What sources of law have the 

commissions generally enforced over the years, beginning 

with George Washington and so forth? Just Army 

regulations or American law or foreign law? What are the 

basic sources of law that they can enforce? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, what I would say, 

Justice Stevens, is, they basically enforce the laws of 

war. At times, there are obviously United States sources 

that are relevant to that. Obviously, if you have a field 

manual or something that says specifically that certain 

offenses are triable under the law of war, that would be 

very instructive in the tribunals. In certain situations 

that I don't think are principally relevant here, you 

might also have war courts that were set up to deal with 

municipal offenses. But that's not what we have. And 

then, they would look to U.S. law. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And what we have here is 

enforcement of the laws of war. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: That is right. And, of 

course, in this context, you have a controlling executive 

act in the form of the regulations themselves that make it 

clear that the executive views things like conspiracy to 

violate the laws of war to be actionable under the laws of 

war.

 Now --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If -- just one hypothetical. 

Assume that the laws of war do not prohibit conspiracy. 

Just assume -- I know you disagree with that. Could the 

President, by his action, add conspiracy as a triable 

offense by a commission? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I think if you did that, 

Justice Stevens, it would present the very difficult 

question that this Court has never squarely addressed, 

which is, does the President have some authority to try, 

by military commission, beyond that which Congress has 

joined him in? Obviously, article 21 of the UCMJ gives 

Congress's sanction to any military commissions, to the 

extent they try crimes that are triable by the law of war. 

So, in that sense, I think, as long as this Court 

construes consistent with over 100 years of United States 

tradition and history, the conspiracy to commit a law -- a 

violation of the law of war is a war crime, then you don't 

have to reach that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- difficult issue. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's easy if it is a war 

crime. I'm trying to wrestle with the question of, if we 

concluded that it were not, and just -- and I'm asking --

can the question add an additional crime that the

commission could try? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I think he --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You think he could. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I think we would take the 

position that he could, as a matter of pure constitutional 

power. I don't think, though -- he has not acted in this 

case on the theory that conspiracy is outside of the laws 

of war. He's acted inconsistent with 150 years of 

tradition. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: So, the basic position you're 

asserting is that we have -- that the -- this commission 

intends to try a violation of the laws of war. And do the 

laws of war then have any application to the procedures 

that they have to follow? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Yes. I mean, in the sense 

that I think that if there were -- there -- the other side 

is certainly able to argue, before the military 

commissions, that certain procedural provisions or the 

like are prohibited by the law of war or give them some 

greater entitlement. Now, as this Court has recognized in 

cases like Madsen, I don't think that the law of war is --

you know, extensively regulates procedure. And, indeed, 

as the Madsen Court recognized, Congress's approach to 

military commissions has been radically different than its 

approach to court-martials. In court-martials, they

regulate every jot and tittle of the procedure. And if 

the UCMJ and its provisions for court-martials applies, 

then the defendants are going to get not just Miranda, but 

Miranda plus, and a whole panoply of rights. 

If, on the other hand, this Court follows the 

precedents in Madsen, it will recognize that only those 

nine provisions of the UCMJ that expressly reference 

military commissions will apply, and the rest is left to a 

much more common-law, war-court approach, where there's 

much greater flexibility. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you -- what do you make 

of the argument that Mr. Katyal just alluded to, that if 

you take the -- as you do -- take the position that the 

commissions are operating under the laws of war, you've 

got to accept that one law of war here is the Geneva 

Convention right to a presumption of POW status unless 

there is a determination by a competent tribunal 

otherwise, with the -- among other things, the rights that 

that carries. I mean, how -- do you -- why not -- why 

don't you go from the frying pan into the fire, in effect, 

when you take the position that the laws of war are what 

the tribunal is applying? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, I don't 

think there's any frying pan effect or fire effect, 

precisely because what you have with respect to the claim

that the Geneva Conventions applies -- okay, that claim 

could be brought to the military commissions, but they 

could adjudicate it and say that the Geneva Conventions 

don't apply here, for any number of reasons. And I think 

that this idea that there needs to be an article 5 

proceeding --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but you're -- are you 

saying that the -- that the commission will adjudicate POW 

status under the Geneva Convention? In other words, are 

you stipulating that the Geneva Convention does apply, so 

that the only argument left between you and Mr. Katyal 

would be whether the commission itself was a competent 

tribunal to make the determination? Is that your 

position? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think so, 

Justice Souter. I mean, I think the disagreement is more 

fundamental than that. What I would say is, a claim could 

be brought in the tribunal that the Geneva Conventions 

apply. Now, just because the Geneva Convention does apply 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you agree that it 

applies as part of the law of war? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think, 

consistent with the position of the executive, that the 

Geneva Convention applies in this particular conflict.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that, I guess, is the 

problem that I'm having. For purposes of determining the 

domestic authority to set up a commission, you say, the 

President is operating under the laws of war recognized by 

Congress, but for purposes of a claim to status, and, 

hence, the procedural rights that go with that status, 

you're saying the laws of war don't apply. And I don't 

see how you can have it both ways. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: We're not trying to have it 

both ways, Justice Souter. The fact that the Geneva 

Conventions are part of the law of war doesn't mean that 

Petitioner is entitled to any protection under those 

conventions. And --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But he is entitled to make a 

claim under them to determine whether, on the merits, he 

is entitled. Isn't that entailed by your position? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I think it is, Your Honor, but 

let me just say that that's a claim that he could have 

brought before the CSRTs, and that is a claim he can still 

bring before the military commissions. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I have --

GENERAL CLEMENT: Lawful --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- I have -- I have trouble 

with the argument that -- insofar as he says there is a 

structural invalidity to the military commission, that he

brings that before the commission. The historic office 

of habeas is to test whether or not you are being tried by 

a lawful tribunal. And he says, under the Geneva 

Convention, as you know, that it isn't. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, and we disagree with 

those claims. We think that most of those claims -- to 

the extent that he thinks some procedural requirement is 

provided either by the Geneva Convention, if applicable --

but we don't think it would be -- and that argument would 

be made; but, if by some other, sort of, principle of the 

law of war that a procedure is required --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's not some --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- he could -- he could make 

that argument. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- procedural -- it's the 

structural requirement of the composition and the -- and 

the appointing origins of the court. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, again, I think he could 

-- he could bring that claim. I don't think it would be 

well taken by the -- by the commission. I don't think 

it's a valid claim. I also don't think, if -- there's any 

reason why that claim has to be brought at this stage in 

the procedure. We think that abstention --

normal criminal suit, even if you claim that the forum is

proceeding.

JUSTICE SCALIA: We --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We don't -- we don't intervene 

on habeas corpus when somebody says that the panel is

Scalia. And this Court made clear that it doesn't

Kennedy, this isn't a "group of people." This is the 

President invoking an authority that he's exercised in 

virtually every war that we've had. It's something that 

was recognized in the Civil War, something in the World 

War II that this Court approved. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I had thought that the 

historic function of habeas is to -- one of its functions 

-- is to test the jurisdiction and the legitimacy of a 

court. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, but -- habeas corpus 

generally doesn't give a right to a pre-enforcement 

challenge. And this Court, for example, in Schlesinger 

against Councilman --

JUSTICE SCALIA: To a forum that is prima facie 

properly constituted. I mean, it -- this is not a -- you

it's been constituted as a court, we normally wait until

issue whether this is a "group of people," on the one 

hand, or a "regularly constituted court," on the other? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean, I don't really 

think there's any serious dispute about which it is. I 

mean, this is something that is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they argue very 

strenuously that this is really just a "group of people"

"regularly constituted court" within the meaning of the

that even if a court might have had jurisdiction to hear 

just that issue and --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- nothing else before the 

DTA, Congress has now spoken, and Congress has made it 

clear that, whatever else is true, these military 

commission proceedings can proceed, and exclusive review 

can be done after the fact, after conviction, in the D.C. 

Circuit. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Exclusive review of what? I

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think I disagree, at 

least --

JUSTICE SOUTER: They can -- they can -- they 

can review their enemy combatant determination. They can 

review the consistency of the procedure of the court with 

whatever law applies. But I don't see that there is a 

clear reservation of right to get to the very basic 

question of the -- of the constitution of the court 

itself. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Oh, I disagree, Justice 

Souter. E(3) specifically preserves the claim that the 

commissions were not, and the procedures were not, 

consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United 

States --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So, you're reading --

UCMJ, or article 36 of the UCMJ, after their conviction, 

they are perfectly free to do that --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's hard for me to --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- under E(3), but --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- see that with the language 

of this, because the language that you're talking about 

refers to "such standards." "Such standards and 

procedures" refer to the preceding paragraph, which is 

standards and procedures specified in the military order 

referred to in subparagraph (a). That military order is 

an order of August 31st which talks about procedures. 

It's not the order that sets up the commission, which is 

an order issued the preceding November. Rather, this 

language seems to mean what it says. 

But even if it didn't -- even if it didn't, 

wouldn't your reading raise a terrifically difficult 

constitutional question, if not this case, in cases that 

are pending right now, where prisoners in Guantanamo are 

claiming that they have not yet had the CSRT hearing, 

they're claiming, one or two, "We had it, and we're still 

here. We won, but we're still here." They're claiming, 

"We don't want to be sent back to Qatar." And they're 

claiming, some, that they were tortured. All right?

interpretation here, and avoid that constitutional

question -- we can't avoid it. So, my question is, one, 

How is what you're arguing consistent with the language I 

quoted? And, two, How could it, if we accepted your 

interpretation, possibly avoid the most terribly difficult 

and important constitutional question of whether Congress 

can constitutionally deprive this Court of jurisdiction in 

habeas cases? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, let me 

answer both pieces of that. I certainly think that such 

standards and procedures to reach the final decision is 

consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United 

States. There is a reference to the first military order. 

I believe there's also a reference to any other 

subsequent orders implementing that. All of that, 

together, implements the November 13th order. So, I would 

think that there is -- it is very easy to read this 

language to allow any challenge that is being brought 

here, with the possible exception of the treaty challenge. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you --

GENERAL CLEMENT: And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- I think the language is 

capacious enough if the treaty challenge is what you 

thought was very important, the D.C. Circuit, at the end 

of the day, could decide whether or not there is a

requirement that the treaty challenge be brought. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, if you can 

straighten me out on the piece that you read about 

"consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United 

States," I thought that it was the Government's position 

that these enemy combatants do not have any rights under 

the Constitution and laws of the United States. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: That is true, Justice 

Ginsburg. And Congress, in this act, was very careful to 

basically write without prejudice to the answer to that 

question. So, we would have that argument. The other 

side would have their argument. What this act provides 

that we don't have any argument on, that was something 

that wasn't before this Court, say, in the Rasul decision, 

was the fact that the procedures that the military has 

promulgated are going to be enforceable under this 

exclusive review provision. So, there at least will be 

some law to apply now under this exclusive review 

provision. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what --

GENERAL CLEMENT: So, that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how will the question, 

whether the laws in the United -- and Constitution -- of 

the United States, whether these petitioners have any 

claim to state under the laws and Constitution of the

United States? Because as I read -- the review that's 

provided doesn't open up that question. It's a very 

narrow review that's given to the D.C. Circuit. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

certainly think that Petitioner will be up there arguing 

that Eisentrager is no longer good law, not just as a 

statutory matter, as a constitutional matter, and those 

arguments will be made. Without respect to that, 

certainly the arguments about article 21 and Article 36, 

that are very much the centerpiece of their argument 

here today, would also be available to the D.C. Circuit. 

And if there's some constitutional requirement that that 

review be slightly broader or slightly narrower, that 

seems like something that can better be adjudicated in the 

context of a concrete case at the point that that review 

is sought. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there --

GENERAL CLEMENT: But one thing I --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there any 

review in this Court, following the D.C. Circuit, either 

the original classification or the conviction -- is there 

-- does this Court have any part in the scheme? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there 

would be 1254 review. Once the provision is in the court 

of appeals, then the case would be under -- under E(3),

the review provision -- then the case would be in the 

court of appeals for purposes of this Court's 1254 

jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I still don't see the answer to 

my question, which had two parts. As to the language, (a) 

which is what's cross-referenced, refers to Military 

Commission Order Number 1, August 31, 2005, or any 

successor military order. The order, as I understand it, 

that's created the commission by the President, is an 

order which was November 13, 2001, not a successor to 

2005. 

But leaving the language aside, what I'm mostly 

interested in, because I think your interpretation 

inevitably creates it, is, what is the answer to the claim 

that it is not constitutional for Congress, without 

suspending the writ of habeas corpus, to accomplish the 

same result by removing jurisdiction from the courts in a 

significant number of cases, even one? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, let me 

answer that question in two parts, which is to say that I 

think that this case, and most of the cases, don't raise a 

serious Suspension Clause problem, for the simple reason 

that I think deferring review or channeling it to the 

court of appeals does not amount to a suspension. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I listed four sets of cases

that I don't see how you could possibly shoehorn into E(2) 

and E(3), even if you are able to shoehorn this one. And 

my language was designed to make you see how difficult it 

is. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, but --

JUSTICE BREYER: I listed four that I don't 

see how anybody could shoehorn into that. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: But, with respect, Justice 

Breyer, I think that cuts both ways, because I don't think 

there's any particular interpretation of these provisions 

on the table before this Court that's going to eliminate 

those potential Suspension Clause issues. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But the whole point, it seems 

to me, of the argument, is, should we not consider the 

significance of those very questions, because, if we 

don't, as Justice Breyer said, at the end of the day, as 

you describe it, we will have to face the serious 

constitutional question whether Congress can, in fact, 

limit jurisdiction without suspending habeas corpus? The 

whole point is to grapple with them now, and to -- and to 

treat them in a way that allows for this adjudication, so 

that we avoid this constitutional difficulty tomorrow. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, first of 

all, I would think general principles of constitutional 

avoidance would say deferring the constitutional question

is a good thing, not a bad thing. The one point I would 

JUSTICE SOUTER: We may not have to reach the 

constitutional question. That's what -- that's what 

constitutional avoidance hopes for. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Right. But I don't see any 

argument on the other side that's really a constitutional 

avoidance argument. Their principal argument is --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, the argument --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- don't apply this --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- the other side -- if you 

want the argument, the other side is, there are several 

hundred cases already pending. And, therefore, if we 

accept your interpretation, we know we have to reach the 

constitutional argument. If we reject your 

interpretation, since all these cases, several hundred of 

them, are already there, it might be: new ones won't be 

brought. But, of course, "new ones won't" might. And, 

therefore, what is your answer to --

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- the question that this is 

unconstitutional -- if not here, in other places? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: And, Justice Breyer, what I 

would say is that our interpretation basically provides 

for pending claims exactly the way that Congress did.

With respect to any future claims that might be brought, 

there may or may not be a constitutional question. 

And if I could turn to our interpretation of the 

DTA, it's the only one that really, I think, reads the 

various provisions in the statute in harmony. Now, this 

Court's decision in Bruner, and in a host of other cases, 

says that when Congress eliminates jurisdiction, pending 

cases fall, unless there's a savings clause. The closest 

thing to a savings clause in this statute, in E(1), is the 

provision that says "except pursuant to Section 1005." 

And I think that's important, because if Congress wanted 

to put in a savings clause of the kind that this Court 

seems to refer to in Bruner, and that would certainly be 

consistent with Senator Levin's intent, it would have been 

very easy. Instead of saying "except for Section 1005," 

they could have said "except for pending cases." 

The choice is important, because what does 

Section 1005 provide? It provides the exclusive review in 

E(2) and E(3). And then, H(2), in very complementary 

fashion, says that, just in case there's any question 

about it, those provisions on E(2) and E(3) apply to 

pending claims governed by those sections. I think every 

word's important. It doesn't say "pending cases," it says 

"pending claims." 

Congress understood two important things. There

were no cases currently pending under E(2) and E(3), 

because Congress was creating E(2) and E(3). It also knew 

that most of the cases before the D.C. Courts had some 

claims that were pure challenges to the final CSRT 

determination and other claims. So, what H(2) says is --

H(2) says that, to the extent those cases involve claims 

governed by E(2) and E(3), they are preserved under E(2) 

and E(3); otherwise, this -- there's no savings clause 

that covers those claims, and their jurisdiction is 

removed. The --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- retroactivity aspect -- I'm 

sorry. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask this, just to 

clarify? When they do take away some jurisdiction of some 

habeas corpus claims, do you defend that, in part, as a 

permissible exercise of the power to suspend the writ, or 

do you say it is not a suspension of the writ? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I think both, ultimately. I 

mean, I don't think --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It can't be both. 

[Laughter.] 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I -- I don't see why I 

can't have alternative arguments here, as for anywhere 

else, Justice Stevens. We think that Congress, in this

action, did not do anything that triggers the suspension 

of the writ. But if you think that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- it did, I think that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- that's your position, they 

did not suspend the writ. You're not arguing that it's a 

justifiable suspension of the writ. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think that the terms of 

the Suspension Clause would be satisfied here because of 

the exigencies of 9/11. If the question is, am I taking 

the position that Congress consciously thought that it was 

suspending the writ, then I would say no. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: And if you think, in order for 

there be to a -- to be a valid suspension, Congress has to 

do it consciously, then I think you could see why the 

arguments are mutually exclusive. My view would be that 

if Congress, sort of, stumbles upon a suspension of the 

writ, but the preconditions are satisfied, that would 

still be constitutionally valid. So, I think that may be 

the disagreement. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't there a --

GENERAL CLEMENT: I mean --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't there a pretty good 

argument that a suspension of the writ of Congress is just

about the most stupendously significant act that the 

Congress of the United States can take? And, therefore, 

we ought to be at least a little slow to accept your 

argument that it can be done from pure inadvertence? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, a couple of things, 

Justice Souter. I would agree with you if what we were 

talking about is suspending the right as to citizens 

within the Continental United States, but all Congress did 

here is restore the law to the understanding of the law 

that had prevailed for 200 years. Now, this Court 

obviously took a different view --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If we have to --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- in Rasul. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- get to the issue, in 

accordance with Justice Breyer's question, whether or not 

the writ of habeas corpus was suspended, you are leaving 

us with the position of the United States that the 

Congress may validly suspend it inadvertently. Is that 

really your position? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I think at least if you're 

talking about the extension of the writ to enemy 

combatants --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The writ is the --

 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- the territory of the United

JUSTICE SOUTER: Now, wait a minute. The writ 

is the writ. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Okay. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: There are not two writs of 

habeas corpus for some cases and for other cases. The 

rights that -- the rights that may be asserted, the rights 

that may be vindicated, will vary with the circumstances, 

but jurisdiction over habeas corpus is jurisdiction over 

habeas corpus. And it seems to me that the position you 

have taken is that if, at the end of the day, we have to 

reach the question that Justice Breyer described, the 

answer to that question may be, "Yes, the writ of habeas 

corpus was suspended by inadvertence. Congress did not 

intend to do it." Is that really your position? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: No, Justice Souter. There's 

no -- my point is not inadvertence. It's whether they 

have to say or incant any magic words that they are now 

invoking their power --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They could surely --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- to suspend the writ. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- set forth a procedure which 

amounts to a suspension of the writ. And if that 

procedure is done in a state of insurrection or invasion,

that would constitute a suspension of the writ, even 

though they don't say, "We are suspending the writ of 

habeas corpus." 

GENERAL CLEMENT: That is my point. And there's 

nothing inadvertent here --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is it also your point when 

there is no insurrection or invasion? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, then any effort to 

suspend the writ would be invalid. But this is not a case 

where there's any question of --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Perhaps that's something that a 

court ought to inquire into when it gets into the question 

of congressional intent. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And how specific --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- I disagree with that. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that intent --

GENERAL CLEMENT: I guess my point would --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- and how specific that intent 

must be. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think I disagree with 

that. But there's two separate points here, is that --

one is, does Congress have to say, "We are now suspending 

the writ under our Suspension Clause"? And I don't think 

there's any call to say that they have to do that.

Obviously, in cases like St. Cyr, this Court has been very 

clear to say, "Congress obviously can't stumble upon the 

Habeas Clause." 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Let's --

GENERAL CLEMENT: But that's not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- at issue here. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume we do not have a 

magic-words requirement. Given the significance of 

suspending the writ of habeas corpus, should we not have a 

pretty clear statement requirement? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Yes. And there's no question 

that Congress, here, tried to amend the habeas statute. 

This is not like St. Cyr, where they didn't go after 2241 

in terms. There's nothing subtle about this statute with 

respect to the clarity with which it speaks --

JUSTICE SOUTER: There may be nothing --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- to the habeas statute. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- subtle about the statute, 

but there is something very silent about the statute as to 

whether Congress understood that it was -- that it was 

acting under its authority to suspend the writ of habeas 

corpus. And, at the very least, that unclarity is 

manifested by the effective-date provision. H(1) doesn't 

have the language that it had before the amendment.

Therefore, it seems to me, there would be some difficulty, 

if we have to get to the question, in finding a clear 

intent on the part of Congress to suspend the writ under 

its article I power. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Souter, 

I don't think making a retroactivity analysis or holding 

here is going to spare you the trouble of dealing with the 

Suspension Clause argument. I mean, in St. Cyr, it's 

worth noting that this Court addressed the specificity 

with which the statute applied separately from the 

retroactivity question. Here, to take the first question 

first, there's no question, this wolf comes as a wolf. 

Congress was going after 2241. It clearly did that. All 

of E(1) --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It comes --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- is a new subsection. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: It comes as a wolf under H(2), 

but the wolf is silent under H(1), and the wolf used to 

speak under H(1), and it had its teeth taken out. 

[Laughter.] 

GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Souter, 

H(1) never spoke to the question. An earlier provision, 

D(1), had very different language, in an earlier provision 

of the statute, that spoke with greater clarity. I'll 

grant --

Congress could have made it clearer doesn't mean that the 

Government loses here. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: The very fact --

GENERAL CLEMENT: Senator --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that Congress chose to 

remove the clarity of the prior provision is of no 

significance? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: It's not of dispositive 

significance, Justice Souter. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think Congress chose to 

do that. One house of Congress chose to do it. We don't 

know what the other house thought, and we don't know what 

the President thought. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: That's a very fair point, 

Justice Scalia. But even to get at the very -- what 

happened here is very analogous to the legislative 

evolution this Court found unilluminating in Martin 

against Haddocks. There, the attorneys fees provision you 

had before it -- before you, used to be in 802 of the 

statute, which was expressly applicable to pending cases. 

Congress moved it out into its own separate section that

JUSTICE SOUTER: What --

GENERAL CLEMENT: This Court did not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Whatever may be the standard of 

due care for courts in reviewing acts of Congress with 

respect to attorneys fees, it doesn't reach the level 

that, it seems to me, is incumbent on us when we're 

talking about suspending the writ of habeas corpus. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't disagree with that, 

Justice Souter, but there's no special habeas 

retroactivity law. There is a special rule, under St. 

Cyr, for habeas, but we amply satisfy that, because --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Can --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- 22- --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- this whole thing is a 

2241(e) new section. So, this is all about amending 

habeas. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you another 

question about the clarity with which Congress spoke? 

This law was proposed and enacted some weeks after this 

Court granted cert in this very case. It is an 

extraordinary act, I think, to withdraw jurisdiction from 

this Court in a pending case. Congress didn't say, 

explicitly, it was doing that. It hasn't done it, as far

are withdrawing jurisdiction in this very case." They 

didn't say that here. So, why should we assume that 

Congress withdraw our jurisdiction to hear this case once 

the case was already lodged here? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I think the answer, Justice 

Ginsburg, is that, you're right, this isn't like ex parte 

McArdle. What made ex parte McArdle so unique is, 

Congress went after this Court's appellate jurisdiction, 

and that alone. What Congress has done here, which is not 

that unusual, and it's certainly happened several times 

since McArdle, is that the Court has modified the 

jurisdiction of all the courts, and that has had the 

effect of eliminating jurisdiction in this Court over a 

pending case. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. --

GENERAL CLEMENT: That's happened any number of 

times. The Guagliardo cases that we cite in our brief 

provide one example. And as Justice Holmes made the point 

there, it's not a situation where you go after this 

Court's appellate jurisdiction, as such. There, it's a 

situation, as Justice Holmes put it, that, when the root 

is cut, the branches fall; when the district court loses 

jurisdiction over these cases, then this Court loses 

jurisdiction. But it's much less of an affront to this

Court than the kind of statute that Congress passed in the 

McArdle situation. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Clement, I, for one, have 

lost track of your time. I'm interested in your arguments 

on the -- on the legitimacy and the regularity of these 

commissions. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: And if I could talk to various 

aspects of that, I'm happy --

JUSTICE BREYER: Can I put the --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- to do so. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- that issue in -- don't --

ignore my question, which is the same as Justice 

Kennedy's, if it doesn't help. I'm trying to focus this. 

And, in my mind, I take their argument as saying, "Look, 

you want to try a war crime. You want to say this is a 

war crimes tribunal. One, this is not a war, at least not 

an ordinary war. Two, it's not a war crime, because that 

doesn't fall under international law. And, three, it's 

not a war crime tribunal or commission, because no 

emergency, not on the battlefield, civil courts are open, 

there is no military commander asking for it, it's not in 

any of those in other respects, like past history. And if 

the President can do this, well, then he can set up 

commissions to go to Toledo, and, in Toledo, pick up an 

alien, and not have any trial at all, except before that

special commission." 

Now, I've tried to summarize a whole bunch of 

points for you to get at, as you wish. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Let me try to hit a couple --

[Laughter.] 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Let me try to hit a couple of 

highlights. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'll be interested in your 

answer, if you can get it out. 

[Laughter.] 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Let me try to hit a couple of 

highlights. This is much more of a call for military 

commissions in a real war than, certainly, the use of 

military commissions against the Medoc Indians or any 

number of other instances in which the President has 

availed himself of this authority in the past. I think 

the events of 9/11 speak to the fact that this is a war 

where the laws of war are involved. 

As to whether or not the law of war encompasses 

the crime of conspiracy to violate the laws of war, we 

think that is clearly established. That is something that 

the United States treated as a valid war crime in the 

Civil War. That is something that the United States 

treated as a valid war crime in World War II. 

I would invite you, as to the former, to look at

Winthrop's Treatise, page 839, note 5. He makes it very 

clear that those conspiracies are not just conspiracies of 

municipal law, what he called "of the first class," but 

they included the second class, which are classic war 

crimes. The most prominent examples are the Lincoln 

conspirators and a conspiracy at Andersonville Prison to 

deny POWs their lawful rights. Clearly, those are classic 

war crimes. In World War II, of course, conspiracy was 

also charged. And this Court saw it in the Kearing case, 

although it didn't reach that element of the charge. 

Now, I think it's very important to understand 

that history, because the most relevant text on this 

question is article 21's reference to the law of war. And 

as this Court was crystal clear in the Madsen case, what 

that reference is, is Congress's effort, when it extended 

the jurisdiction of the courts-martials to include more 

and more crimes, that it didn't want to crowd out the 

military jurisdiction of the military commissions just 

because they had concurrent jurisdiction. And this Court, 

in Madsen, said what Congress authorized was the 

jurisdiction of the military commissions as it existed in 

1916, and then presumably again when it passed article 21 

of the UCMJ, the jurisdiction that existed as of 1950. 

Well, in 1960, you could try conspiracies to violate the 

law of war. In 1950, you could violate conspiracies to

the law of war. 

So, now let me try to get to the procedures that 

would be applicable. The argument that's made here is an 

extraordinary one, that article 36, when it says that 

military commissions can deviate from the laws of 

evidence, to the extent the President determines 

necessary, except that it must apply for the -- comply with 

the provisions of the UCMJ. Clearly, what that provision 

means is the provisions of the UCMJ that specifically 

impose requirements on the military commissions. And 

there are nine of them. And they impose some -- certain 

minimum rules. 

But to say that that provision incorporates all 

of the UCMJ provisions that put much higher requirements 

on courts-martials, is to violate this Court's Madsen 

decision, which clearly recognized that there were 

differences between court-martials and military 

commissions. And, although that was an act -- that was a 

case that addressed the articles of war, article 38 is 

identical to article 36(a) of the UCMJ, so that's not a 

difference that matters. 

And, if I could say, the other thing is, that 

just violates any normal principle of statutory 

construction, because then the nine express references to 

the military commissions are rendered utterly superfluous.

 Clearly, what Congress had in mind was that, 

"You must comply with those provisions of the UCMJ that 

apply specifically to the military commissions." 

If I could make this point clear, because I 

think it's helpful in reading the past cases, what made 

Yamashita and other of the World War II cases so difficult 

is that the President in that situation constituted 

commissions that violated even the procedural rules that 

the articles of war made specifically applicable to the 

commissions. And so, if you look, for example, at Justice 

Rutledge's dissent in the Yamashita case, he was at pains 

to emphasize that very few of the provisions of the 

articles of war applied to military commissions. And the 

difficulty was that the -- that the military, in that 

case, was not complying with even those provisions that 

specifically applied to military commissions by terms. 

That's not an issue here. These military 

commissions comply with all of the provisions of the UCMJ 

that are specifically addressed to military commissions. 

So, I just don't think there's a procedural problem here. 

The import of extending article 2 jurisdiction 

to new individuals doesn't mean that anything in 

Yamashita, as to this point, is really no -- is still 

relevant. What that does is, it takes away the argument 

-- to the extent that these individuals are within article

2, it takes away the argument that the President doesn't 

have to even comply with those provisions of the UCMJ that 

are expressly directed to the military commissions. But 

that's not an argument we're making here. 

The argument on the other side of this is really 

that when Congress specifies that nine rules apply to 

military commissions, and everything else applies to 

courts-martials, that somehow all of them have to apply to 

the military commissions. And as Justice Scalia's 

question alluded to earlier, in order to accept that 

argument, you really have to believe that what Congress 

was doing when it was carefully preserving the military --

the jurisdiction of the military commissions was simply to 

preserve the option of calling something that had to 

comply with every single statutory requirement in the 

court-martials. They got to label it something else. 

They got to label it a "military commission." 

Clearly, if you look at the legislative history 

of Article of War 15 and article 21, as they were 

developed in the Madsen decision and discussed in the 

authoritative testimony of General Crowder, that's exactly 

what wasn't going on. They wanted to make sure that this 

argument, that as we get more and more things that come 

within the military jurisdiction of the courts-martials, 

that somehow we're cutting back on the military

commissions. That's not what they wanted. 

The next thing that may be lurking in the 

question is the question of, Wwat about the Geneva 

Conventions? And I think that, very importantly, we have 

arguments that we have surfaced in our briefs that the 

Geneva Conventions do not provide relief in these 

circumstances, that they do not apply, for various 

reasons. But the first question, at the outset, is 

whether this Court is going to overrule that portion of 

Eisentrager that basically said the Geneva Conventions are 

not judicially enforceable. 

Now, of course, this Court can say, "That was 

the '29 Convention, and this is the 1949 Convention." 

But, as the court of appeals correctly determined --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And there was a footnote 

dicta. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think it was 

dicta, Justice Stevens. If there's one thing I think the 

Eisentrager decision has, it's an awful lot of alternative 

holdings. And --

[Laughter.] 

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- Justice Black was concerned 

about that, and said, "What are you doing reaching the 

merits when you have, you know, said there's no 

jurisdiction?" But the Court, as a holding, said that the

Geneva Conventions of 1929 did not apply. There aren't 

any material differences about 1949 Conventions. 

And I ask you to think about why that makes 

sense. Because the 1949 Geneva Conventions were being 

negotiated contemporaneously with this Court's decision in 

Eisentrager. And even if you think the rule is different 

today, at that point, Justice Jackson was quite correct 

that the idea that an enemy combatant would get access to 

the domestic courts of a detaining power was absolutely 

absurd. And so, what the -- the framers of the Geneva 

Convention recognized that they were dealing with a group 

of people that were uniquely vulnerable. So, they went to 

great pains to make sure there were mechanisms to enforce 

their rights. And so, there are various provisions for 

party-to-party enforcement. There are various provisions 

for getting the protecting powers, which is now a role 

basically taken over by the ICRC, to get access to the 

detainees and to provide other mediating effects. 

So, what you have is a treaty that's really 

written against the backdrop, that of course these people 

aren't going to be able to get to the domestic courts of 

their detaining -- the detaining power. If you look at 

the treaty, and read it as a whole, I think it's almost 

impossible to read it as applying judicially enforceable 

rights in the domestic courts. The constant --

 JUSTICE BREYER: Does it -- does it -- does it 

define the contours, along with other relevant 

international sources, of the meaning of the statutory 

words "laws of war." He's being charged with a violation 

of the laws of war in both statutes, like -- what is it? 

-- 2240 -- 2441, in Quirin. To get the meaning of that 

term, courts looked to other law. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And, in particular, why isn't 

he part of the Common Article 3 under the Geneva 

Convention, as Judge Williams found? That's part of the 

same question. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Judge Williams found 

that, you know, Common Article 3 was applicable here. I 

don't know why that the Common Article 3, and nothing else 

would be judicially enforceable. And I don't read his 

opinion as saying otherwise. I think he still took the 

view that the entirety of the Geneva Conventions were not 

judicially enforceable. 

Now, I take it that the thrust of the question, 

though, is, don't these Geneva Conventions, even if 

they're not applicable for one reason or another, don't 

they form the background of some sort of customary 

international law that influences what -- how we should 

interpret the word "law of war" in the statute? And I 

would say, at a minimum, if there is some role for

customary international law here, it has to, consistently 

with The Paquete Habana case, take into account and give 

due weight to a controlling executive act. 

Here, the President has determined, for example, 

that conspiracy is an actionable violation of the law of 

war that can be tried in front of these commissions. He's 

made that clear. He's also made clear that these 

procedures are sufficient and supply the rights. And so, 

I think that has to take -- be taken into account into the 

analysis. 

I think, also, since article 21 is the most 

logical place you would -- you would look to any of this 

as the law of war, I think it's important to understand 

that I would read that as incorporating some question 

about what kind of crimes can be brought in this 

jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Is it the President, and not 

Congress, defining the content of the law, the criminal 

law, under which a person will be tried? Isn't there a 

"separation of powers" problem there? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I sure hope not, Justice 

Breyer, because that's been the tradition for over 200 

years. And article 21 itself makes this clear, because 

what does it say can be tried by military commission? It 

says anything that's made a violation of statute or law of

war. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But I don't --

GENERAL CLEMENT: So --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- think, Mr. Clement, the 200 

years have approved of his adding additional crimes under 

the law of war. I mean, he has never -- I don't think we 

have ever held that the President can make something a 

crime which was not already a crime under the law of war. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I think that may be true, 

Justice Stevens --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- certainly as to the article 

-- 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And one --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- 21 point. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- of the issues is whether 

he's done that here --

GENERAL CLEMENT: But --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- I think. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: But there's no innovation in 

trying conspiracy as a violation of the law of war. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: If you're right on that, 

you're right on the ultimate question, too. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I hope so, because 

there's really no question that conspiracy has been

charged. And, like you said, I would encourage you to 

look at footnote 5 on page 839 of the Winthrop Treatise; 

and this Quirin case had, also, that charge brought before 

it. Colepaugh against Looney, which is a Tenth Circuit 

case from World War II, involved the charge of conspiracy. 

Now, they're going to come up here and tell you, 

"Well, but that wasn't -- you know, in Colepaugh and 

Quirin, that wasn't the one that the Court settled on." 

But that doesn't dispute the fact that that is a crime 

that has traditionally been charged as a violation of the 

law of war. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your time is -- why isn't Hamdam 

a uniquely vulnerable individual that -- you used 

the phrase "uniquely vulnerable individuals" were involved 

in another case, but not here. Why not here? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, he's -- I mean, I -- I'm 

not saying that he isn't somebody who is protected by the 

laws of war, the customary laws of war. I think that he 

is protected by those. I don't think he's protected by 

the Geneva Conventions, but that's largely because he 

chose not to comply with the basic laws of war. He's 

obviously --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought -- I thought -- I 

thought you said all prisoners of war were uniquely 

vulnerable -- I thought that was the point you were making

of the supervising powers, or whatever they're called. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Right, but not the domestic 

courts of the detaining power. And if he's any different 

than a usual prisoner of war, it's because he's 

disentitled themselves to some protections by what has 

been determined by the CSRT protections. 

Let me just address, if I could, the idea that 

having provided him with CSRT, we now have to provide him 

with an article 5 hearing. The CSRT provisions provide 

all of the protections, and then some, that were normally 

provided in an article 5 hearing. They were focused on 

the question that is relevant in this dispute, which is 

whether or not somebody is an innocent civilian or an 

unlawful enemy combatant. Nobody has a claim here that 

they were part of the uniformed al Qaeda division that 

complied with all of the laws of war, such that they are 

entitled to POW status. The POW unlawful enemy combatant 

line is not one that really needs to be policed in this 

conflict. The serious concern -- and it was his claim 

when Petitioner walked into Federal Court in Washington --

he said, "I am not an enemy combatant. I did not take up 

arms against the United States." That's the claim that he 

brought to the CSRT, the CSRT rejected. 

For these purposes, at this stage in the 

litigation, that ought to be enough to allow the 

proceeding to go forward in front of the military 

commission. 

One of the defenses in the military commissions 

is lawful combatancy immunity. He can make the argument 

that he wants to make in front of the commissions. If the 

commission rejects the argument, then there will be review 

of that decision in the court of appeals on a concrete 

record. This Court can then address that under 1254. 

The use of military commissions to try enemy 

combatants has been part and parcel of the war power for 

200 years. Congress recognized it in 1916 in the Articles 

of War, then again, after World War II, in the UCMJ. This 

Court recognized it in a host of cases, not just Quirin, 

but Yamashita, Eisentrager, and, most clearly, in Madsen. 

Since that is such an important component of the law of 

war, something that has been part and parcel of that power 

from Major Andre's capture to today, there is no reason 

for this Court to depart from that tradition. 

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KATYAL 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. KATYAL: It is a foundational role of this 

Court, as Justice Kennedy says, to test the lawfulness of 

tribunals, particularly executive detention. And in the 

pretrial area, that's the historic role of this Court from 

Bereford to Quirin. This claim is -- Mr. Hamdan's claim 

is primarily a jurisdictional one, as both courts below 

found when they recognized his ability to bring this 

pretrial challenge, because he is not an offender under 

the laws of war until he obtains his article 5 hearing, 

because the charge doesn't state a violation of the laws 

of war, which is, itself, jurisdictional, and because it 

doesn't follow the procedures of the laws of war, which 

this Court, in Yamashita, in pages 5, and, in the dissent, 

at page 72, recognized as jurisdictional. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't want to --

MR. KATYAL: Now, that was --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't want to take up from 

your time, but have you read the footnote that the -- Mr. 

Clement relies on very heavily? 

MR. KATYAL: With respect to conspiracy? Yes, I 

have. And I do believe the text says that they're 

referring to domestic offenses. It's certainly the case

that conspiracy has been tried as a violation of the laws 

of war at some point in the Civil War. But that has been 

entirely eclipsed by the modern laws of war, which have 

rejected it everywhere. 

And if you adopt the Government's reading, 

Justice Stevens, that the laws of war are frozen into time 

in 1916, then I believe there goes the Government's case 

entirely, because the thrust of the Government's case is 

the laws of war have to adapt to this stateless, 

territoryless organization known as al Qaeda. If we're 

playing by 1916 rules, there is no way that this 

commission would have been accepted in 1916. 

Now, all of those jurisdictional pretrial 

challenges were accepted by the courts below when the full 

panoply of DTA rights -- when the full panoply of rights 

existed. Now the DTA certainly circumscribes the scope. 

We don't know whether question one very clearly is able to 

be raised after the DTA's enactment. We certainly --

question two, as the Solicitor General has said, is not 

raisable. We don't know when it can be raised, because 

the President can block final review for all time under 

the DTA. He has the keys to the Federal courthouse. And 

if you defer to this system and give the President the 

ability to launch all of these tribunals for 75 

individuals with these charges, with these procedures, you

will be countenancing a huge expansion of military 

jurisdiction. Conspiracy is one of the few offenses, 

Justices, that has now been rejected by the laws of war 

internationally in tribunal after tribunal. It's 

certainly never been approved by a Federal Court. And, 

indeed, it has been rejected. In Colepaugh, for example, 

no challenge to conspiracy was raised. 

The Government's argument, in the end, it seems 

to me, is one that this Court rejected in Loving, because 

it depends, as its predicate, on the idea that the 

President has ultimate flexibility with respect to these 

military commissions, except for the nine provisions in 

the UCMJ which govern translators and deposition 

testimony. It is inconceivable that the UCMJ, when 

enacted, intended to regulate military commissions with 

only that bare bones to it. Indeed, General Crowder said, 

"Military commissions and courts-martial follow the same 

procedures." 

Finally, Justices, we'd just point out that the 

predicate of abstention is not met here. This is not a 

ordinary criminal trial applying lawful ordinary 

procedures. This is an ad hoc trial in which the 

procedures are all defined with the President. He says 

the laws of war do not apply when we're talking about 

protecting this vulnerable individual at Guantanamo. But

then he says they do apply and permit him to charge Mr. 

Hamdan with the one offense which is rejected entirely at 

international law. 

It was a great American patriot, Thomas Paine, 

who warned, "He who -- that would make his own liberty 

secure must guard even his enemy from oppression, for if 

he violates that duty, he establishes a precedent that 

will reach unto himself." 

That's what we're asking you to do here, just 

enforce the lawful uses of military commissions and the 

historic role of this Court. 

Thank you. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

[Whereupon, at 12:31 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
