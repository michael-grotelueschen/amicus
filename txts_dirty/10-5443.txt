3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next this morning in Case 10-5443, Fowler v. United 

States. 

6  Mr. Crawford. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. CRAWFORD 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. CRAWFORD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  There is a significant disagreement between 

12 the circuit court over what the government must prove 

13 beyond a reasonable doubt to establish the violation of 

14 Title 18, United States Code, section 1512(a)(1)(C). 

This qualifying Federal criminal statute must be 

16 construed clearly, consistently, and narrowly. Yet, the 

17 Eleventh Circuit's opinion in this case conflicts with 

18 the rulings in factually similar cases: From the Second 

19 Circuit, Lopez, and the Fifth Circuit, Causey and other 

circuit precedent. More specifically -­

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Are they all consistent? 

22  MR. CRAWFORD: It would be our opinion they 

23 are all inconsistent, which is what we need from this 

24 Court, Your Honor.

 The Eleventh Circuit erred by placing the

1 word "possible" in the statute and, thus, significantly 

2 modifying the plain language of the statute, and by 

3 proposing a standard of mere possibility -­

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Crawford, what's your 

standard? Sometimes you say "certain"; sometimes you 

6 say "likely"; sometimes you say "plausible." Which -­

7 which is your standard? 

8  MR. CRAWFORD: Justice Kagan, we would offer 

9 the standard of realistic likelihood, which we cited in 

our brief on page 17 and page 41, as the appropriate 

11 standard in this particular case. That is language that 

12 comes from Lopez, the Second Circuit case, and also 

13 places a higher burden on the government, which we 

14 believe is important in order to maintain the 

Federal/State balance that is required in Federal 

16 criminal matters. 

17  It is a reasonable standard, more reasonable 

18 than what we would characterize the governor's -- the 

19 government's standard of "reasonable possible." In 

their brief, page 9, 10, and 13, they propose that, 

21 which, we would add, differs from what the Eleventh 

22 Circuit said. 

23  If you'll remember, in Lopez, the Eleventh 

24 Circuit offered the standard "possible." And yet, the 

government, backing away from that a bit, in their

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 briefs, on page 9, 10, and 13, used the phrase 

2 "reasonably possible." And while we would concede it is 

3 an improvement on the Eleventh Circuit's mere 

4 possibility standard, it still is vague. It still 

upsets the -­

6  JUSTICE ALITO: The statute speaks of the 

7 intent of the defendant. The defendant must intend to 

8 prevent the communication of information about a Federal 

9 offense or a possible Federal offense to a law 

enforcement officer who happens to be a Federal law 

11 enforcement officer. So, it's all a matter of intent. 

12  Where do you get this question of whether 

13 it's possible or likely or certain or whatever that the 

14 information will eventually get to a Federal law 

enforcement officer? Isn't it -- isn't it simply what 

16 is in the mind of the defendant? 

17  MR. CRAWFORD: We believe that 

18 subsection (g) of the statute precludes the -- or takes 

19 the mens rea element of the defendant off the table with 

respect to whether or not the person is a law 

21 enforcement official or whether or not there's an 

22 ongoing Federal criminal investigation. 

23  We would agree with you that the law does 

24 require that the defendant intend to prevent a 

communication. The Eleventh Circuit puts the word 

5

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 "possible" in there and says intent to prevent a 

2 possible communication. And that's the rub, Justice 

3 Alito, that we're asking this Court to address. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Going -- going back to 

Justice Alito's question: Obviously, the statute's not 

6 written to say the intent to preclude a witness from 

7 talking to law enforcement officials. If it were that 

8 simple about a Federal crime, then it wouldn't matter 

9 whether it was likely, possible. All that we have -­

know is that the witness was -- that the killing was 

11 intended to stop them from talking to law enforcement, 

12 period. So, clearly, (g) has to have a meaning 

13 different than merely stopping from someone talking to a 

14 law enforcement officer, because there has to be some 

connection to that officer being a Federal officer. 

16  So, going back to Justice Alito's question, 

17 how do you define the intent? What is the defendant's 

18 intent? If he doesn't have to know it's a Federal 

19 officer, what does he have to intend?

 MR. CRAWFORD: We believe that you define or 

21 would find -- determine the defendant's intent based on 

22 the circumstances and the totality of the circumstances 

23 of the case. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Articulate what the 

intent has to be.

1  MR. CRAWFORD: The intent would have to be a 

2 realistic likelihood that there's going to be 

3 communication. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does the defendant have 

to know that? That's my question. Does he have to 

6 intend to stop the witness from communicating this 

7 information to someone that's related to either a 

8 Federal judge or a Federal law enforcement agent? 

9  MR. CRAWFORD: Yes, Your Honor. That is the 

gravamen of the offense. That intent element is 

11 essential. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: What do you say that is -­

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: What does that have to do 

14 with reasonable likelihood that it would occur? I mean, 

he either intends it or he doesn't intend it. What -­

17  JUSTICE ALITO: The reasonable likelihood 

18 that this person who was killed -- now, you say 

19 "realistic likelihood."

 MR. CRAWFORD: That is correct. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: The realistic likelihood 

22 that this person who was killed might have gone to a 

23 Federal officer doesn't at all establish that the intent 

24 of the person who killed him was to prevent him from 

going to that officer, does it?

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it seems to me you 

3 have to stand on one stool or the other one. Either 

4 it -- it relates to intent, as the statute says, or all 

there has to be is a reasonable likelihood that this 

6 person who was killed would have gone to a Federal 

7 official. 

8  MR. CRAWFORD: Well -­

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is it?

 MR. CRAWFORD: It is our position that we 

11 are trying to determine or the jury has to determine a 

12 future act. The prevention of communication denotes the 

13 future tense of the word "communicate." So, what 

14 standard should we ask the jury to use in order to 

determine whether the government has provided evidence 

16 that there was going to be a future act prevented? And 

17 so, it is -­

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, that -- that's not 

19 what the statute says. It doesn't talk about preventing 

a future act. It doesn't say anyone who kills someone 

21 who would have gone to a Federal official is -- is 

22 subject to this penalty.

1 your -- your realistic likelihood test would be quite 

2 reasonable, but it doesn't say that. It says that 

3 the -- the killing has to be with the intent of 

4 preventing him from going.

 MR. CRAWFORD: The intent to prevent the 

6 communication, the communication in the future is what 

7 is modified by the word "prevent." And so, that's what 

8 we're -- that's what we're struggling with, Your Honor. 

9 We're trying to come up with a standard as to what -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Crawford, do you think 

11 this is right, that the statute says that the person has 

12 to prevent the communication to a law enforcement 

13 officer? The statute also says that the law enforcement 

14 officer, in fact, has to be a Federal law enforcement 

officer, but because of subsection (g), the statute does 

16 not require that the person intend the communication to 

17 be to a Federal law enforcement officer, and that's what 

18 we're struggling over, correct? 

19  MR. CRAWFORD: That is correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and in doing that -­

21 I mean, I guess my question to you is the same as my 

22 question to the Government, which is where any of these 

23 standards come from. And I agree that the statute does 

24 not provide a lot of guidance, but how does one pick 

between a realistic likelihood or a possibility or a 

9

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 theoretical possibility or any of those things? 

2  MR. CRAWFORD: We would urge the Court to 

3 pick a particular standard, if you're going to, to help 

4 us interpret this statute that would strike the 

appropriate balance between State and Federal criminal 

6 jurisdiction. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why don't we pick the 

8 standard that is set out in the text of the statute? 

9 Let me give you this example:

 Let's -- let's hypothesize a very cold, 

11 calculating, rational defendant who is planning a 

12 Federal crime, let's say the hijacking of an airplane 

13 over international waters, and this defendant finds out 

14 that his mother has learned about the plot. Now, he 

says, well, you know, I think there's a one-tenth of 

16 1 percent chance that mom is going to go to the FBI and 

17 turn me in, but in order to prevent that, I'm going to 

18 kill her. I intend -- I kill her with the -- for the 

19 purpose of preventing her from going to the FBI, even 

though I think very, very, very unlikely she's going to 

21 do that. 

22  Hasn't that defendant violated this statute? 

23  MR. CRAWFORD: We believe the jury would 

24 make that determination as to whether or not it was 

likely, realistically likely that mom would report him

2 trying to do, is give the lower courts or the -- or the 

3 jury -­

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't -- I think Justice 

Alito can protect his own question, but I don't think 

6 you've answered it. You've put in realistic likelihood. 

7 He's asked you whether or not as a matter of law, 

8 assuming that you're a juror and you read the statute 

9 and you were instructed on the words of the statute and 

you have Justice Alito's hypothetical, what result? 

11  MR. CRAWFORD: The result of the question of 

12 intent? Or what are you asking the result of -­

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: The reliability under the 

14 statute under Justice Alito's hypothetical.

 MR. CRAWFORD: Then we would say, yes, that 

16 the defendant could be found to have violated the 

17 statute under that particular hypothetical. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Then Justice 

19 Alito's next question -- again, he can protect his own 

line of questioning -- but what does that have to do 

21 with realistic likelihood? There's no realistic 

22 likelihood; it was only a half of 1 percent chance that 

23 the communication would be made. So, that takes 

24 realistic likelihood off the table, and if it's off the 

table, you have to give us a different test.

1  MR. CRAWFORD: Well, then, I would go with 

2 the beyond a reasonable doubt that the government must 

3 prove in any criminal matter. 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I wondered. 

You haven't really argued that, so maybe I'm missing 

6 something, and this question may be better for the other 

7 side, but this statute, as you go through it, has some 

8 elements. 

9  The first are facts about the world, killing 

people; the second has to do with intent, and then they 

11 talk about all these different things to stop him from 

12 going to a Federal officer; the third says no state of 

13 mind need be proved with respect to the fact he works 

14 for the Feds. So, therefore, it's not part of intent.

 Now, if it's a circumstance that is an 

16 element of the offense and it is not part of the intent 

17 of the defendant, then isn't it an element, like all 

18 other elements, that you have to prove beyond a 

19 reasonable doubt?

 MR. CRAWFORD: We would agree. That is -­

21  JUSTICE BREYER: You didn't argue it, so 

22 nobody's ever adopted this, so I feel I might be barking 

23 up the wrong tree. Now, I grant you, you're not the 

24 leaf on the tree that's going to give me the answer I 

need, which is why I'm wrong, but -- but did you -­

1 you've researched this and haven't really argued this 

2 point. So, why not? 

3  MR. CRAWFORD: Well, we understand. And -­

4 and we are assuming, of course, that all elements of the 

offense have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 

6 What we've tried to do is provide the Court with some 

7 sort of standard that the jury could be instructed as 

8 how to prove that fourth element, and that is this 

9 future communication.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think a realistic 

11 likelihood must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt? 

12  MR. CRAWFORD: We do. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: You think a juror can grasp 

14 all of that in a juror's mind? You must find that there 

is -­

21 proper instructions and definitions of the word 

22 "realistic likelihood" -­

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the -- suppose 

24 the prosecutor argued a realistic prospect there. When 

Gamble confessed, he confessed to the local police, and

2 Federal prosecutors. So, if that's what the government 

3 counsel argues, wouldn't that be a realistic prospect -­

4 wouldn't they likely have done the same thing with 

respect to Fowler that they did with respect to Gamble? 

6  MR. CRAWFORD: Well, I would answer that two 

7 ways, Justice Ginsburg. Number one, that is not what 

8 happened in the case below. Once Mr. Gamble decided 

9 to -- 4 years after the killing of Officer Horner, to 

talk to local law enforcement, it was not immediately 

11 reported to the Federal law enforcement officials. It 

12 was reported years later. So, we don't have that 

13 immediacy. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was -- what was the time 

sequence? How much after Gamble came to the local 

16 police did the local police go to the -­

17  MR. CRAWFORD: Officer Horner was found dead 

18 on March of 1998, and he came forward to the local 

19 police in 2002 after he was sentenced to 20 years on an 

unrelated State robbery. There was then several years 

21 before the U.S. Attorney's Office was contacted, and 

22 they decided to go forward with the case that is before 

23 us today. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Several years after 2002?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When did they go to the 

6 Federal authorities after 2002? 

7  MR. CRAWFORD: 2003. Almost -- almost a 

8 year afterwards it was -- it was taken over there. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is -- what is 

your position on the subsequent element or -- or feature 

11 about relating to the commission or possible commission 

12 of a Federal offense? Does the defendant have to know 

13 that his actions to prevent communication involve an 

14 underlying Federal offense?

 MR. CRAWFORD: No, Your Honor, they do not. 

16 You basically take your offense as you find them, just 

17 as you take your officer as you find him, and we believe 

18 that's the -­

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? 

1512(g)(2) talks about with respect to the law 

21 enforcement officer. 

22  MR. CRAWFORD: Correct. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought 

24 you'd say there's a negative implication that intent has

1 whether or not this is a possible Federal crime. 

2  MR. CRAWFORD: Well, we -- we are willing to 

3 concede that there was a possible Federal crime that was 

4 occurring at the time of Officer Horner's death.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you willing to 

6 concede that the defendant knew that? 

7  MR. CRAWFORD: I'm willing to concede the 

8 defendant -- it need not be proved that the defendant 

9 knew that.

 Now, if the government can establish 

11 evidence of that, we believe that goes to the 

12 defendant's intent and to a different element, but the 

13 government need not prove that because we believe the 

14 subsection (g) takes that off the table.

 JUSTICE ALITO: The issue -- the issue here 

16 is the sufficiency of the evidence. So -- so -- and the 

17 question is whether a reasonable juror could adopt a 

18 certain view of the facts. 

19  Now, couldn't a reasonable juror in this 

situation take this view of the facts? Your client 

21 killed Officer Horner simply because your client didn't 

22 want to go to jail. He didn't particularly care whether 

23 he was going to be prosecuted in State court or Federal 

24 court; he just didn't want to go to jail. So his intent 

was to prevent the communication of information about

2 enforcement officer who could send him to jail, and that

the statute. 

6  Now, what's wrong with that view of the 

7 facts? 

8  MR. CRAWFORD: We believe, Your Honor, that 

9 if that is the reading of the statute, that that would 

basically federalize murder, that there is always going 

11 to be some overlapping Federal crime that is possible, 

12 or the possible commission of, and if that becomes the 

13 standard or the reading or the interpretation of 1512, 

14 then every case is going to be allowed to be 

prosecuted -­

17 would be that if that were the law, (a)(1)(C) would have

6 take it is mostly prosecuted by Federal officials. 

7  MR. CRAWFORD: Well, I would agree with 

8 that. 

9  Certainly not in the State of Florida. I 

would say that most State attorneys handle bank 

11 robberies as much if not more than the Federal 

12 authorities. But we would concede that bank robbery is 

13 a Federal crime. That's why we need something more than 

14 just Federal crime to confer jurisdiction.

 We need Federal law enforcement involvement, 

16 and we have nothing on this record that shows any 

17 involvement of Federal law enforcement. And that's why 

18 the case needs to be reversed. That's why the Eleventh 

19 Circuit's standard of mere possibility is too broad, and 

we're looking for a rule from this Court that will 

21 narrow that and keep that -- that balance of Federal and 

22 State criminal jurisprudence where it needs to be.

1 it please the Court: 

2  When Congress enacted section 1512(a)(1)(C), 

3 it sought to protect the integrity of Federal criminal 

4 investigations and prosecutions. The statute requires 

the government to prove four things -- an actus reus, a 

6 mens rea and two Federal nexus elements, one of which is 

7 at issue in this case. The actus reus is murder, the 

8 mens rea that's common to every prosecution under 

9 section 1512(a)(1)(C) is an intent to prevent the 

communication of information to a law enforcement 

11 officer. The first Federal nexus element requires that 

12 that information relate to the commission or possible 

13 commission of a Federal offense; and the second Federal 

14 nexus element, the one at issue in this case, requires 

that there's a reasonable possibility that the 

16 information would have been communicated to a Federal 

17 officer if the murder had not occurred. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, where does that 

19 reasonable possibility standard come from, Ms. 

Harrington? 

21  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, it comes from trying 

22 to construe all the different relevant provisions of the 

23 statute to make sense together. Section (a)(1)(C) 

24 specifies that a defendant has to have an intent to 

prevent the communication of the relevant information to

1 a law enforcement officer; section 1515 tells us that 

2 the law enforcement officer has to be a Federal law 

3 enforcement officer, that's the definitional section; 

4 and then section 1512(g)(2) specifies that the 

government doesn't need to prove any state of mind about 

6 the fact that the officer is a Federal officer. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Let me give you a 

8 hypothetical similar to the one that I gave your -- your 

9 friend. Two men are sitting on a park bench planning 

the commission of a Federal crime, hijacking of an 

11 airplane, and they think they're by themselves; so 

12 they're talking about this, and then after they've had a 

13 discussion they turn around and they see there's 

14 somebody standing very close by; and so they say we have 

to kill this person to prevent him from going to the 

16 FBI, and so they do, and they're prosecuted under this 

17 statute. But then at trial they bring out evidence that 

18 the person didn't speak a word of English, only spoke 

19 Russian. So there wasn't any possibility whatsoever 

that this person was going to report that to the FBI or 

21 any law enforcement officer. Violation of this statute 

22 or not? 

23  MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. In our view there are 

24 two different ways to prove a violation of the statute. 

One is if you just read section (a)(1)(C), a natural 

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 reading of that section is that if a -- if defendant has 

2 a specific intent to prevent a communication to a 

3 Federal officer specifically, then that's a violation of 

4 the statute.

 What subsection (g)(2) tells us is that you 

6 don't need to prove a Federal officer's specific intent 

7 for every violation of the statute, but if you can prove 

8 that, then that's enough. And so in this case there's 

9 no evidence that the Petitioner had a specific intent as 

to a Federal officer, but, for example, if Officer 

11 Horner had said, hey, I'm the FBI or hey, I'm calling 

12 the FBI right now, and then he had killed him, that 

13 would have been enough whether it were true or not. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: So a realistic probability 

relates only to the question of whether it would have 

16 been conveyed to a Federal officer as opposed to some 

17 other law enforcement officer? 

18  MS. HARRINGTON: Yes, that's right, and in 

19 section (g)(2) it's described as a circumstance that the 

Federal, that the officer in question is a Federal 

21 officer, and so that's -- that's a fact in the world 

22 that the jury needs to make a determination about. Of 

23 course, it's a fact in the world about -­

1  MS. HARRINGTON: That's okay. I was going 

2 to say it's a fact in the world about something that by 

3 -- by the design of the defendant is never going to 

4 happen. The communication that's at issue when you -­

when you don't have the Federal officer's specific 

6 intent, is a communication that's never going to happen, 

7 and so the jury has to make a reasonable prediction 

8 about what could have happened in the absence of the 

9 murder.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do you see -­

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose in Justice Alito's 

12 hypothetical, two guys on the park bench, and they find 

13 out that the man with the gray coat behind them was 

14 listening. They say, we have to get the man with the 

gray coat. They turn around and they shoot a man with a 

16 gray coat, but it's a different man. What result? 

17  MS. HARRINGTON: If they -- if they -­

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It wasn't the man that was 

19 listening. They got the wrong guy.

 MS. HARRINGTON: But if -- if the same -­

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: The intent was there. 

22  MS. HARRINGTON: So they say, we have to 

23 shoot this guy to keep him from talking to the FBI? 

24 That's still a violation of the statute, because they 

have the requisite intent as to a Federal officer.

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then your realistic 

2 possibility -- the realistic probability standard just 

3 falls out of your test. 

4  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, just to be clear, the 

realistic possibility part only comes in where the 

6 defendant doesn't have a specific intent as to the 

7 Federal officer specifically. So, in Justice Alito's 

8 hypothetical, the intent was to prevent a communication 

9 to the FBI in particular, and if a defendant has that 

specific Federal officer, a specific intent, it doesn't 

11 matter whether it might have happened, would have 

12 happened, could have happened. 

13  Where the reasonable possibility standard 

14 comes in is in cases like this one, where the defendant 

has an intent to prevent a communication to a law 

16 enforcement officer for sure, but doesn't have any 

17 specific intent as to the Federal nature. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think it's very 

19 difficult to instruct the jury, to say, now, sometimes 

there's realistic probability, sometimes there isn't. I 

21 just don't know what this jury instruction is going to 

22 look like. 

23  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I think the jury 

24 instruction would say, you know, you need to make a 

determination about what could have happened if the

1 murder hadn't occurred, and if you find that there is a 

2 reasonable possibility that there would have been a 

3 communication with the Federal officer -- and that can 

4 be proved in any number of different ways in any 

particular case -- then you find that there's a 

6 violation of the statute. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you -- why do you 

8 need that? I mean, we're always talking here about -­

9 about murders of a witness, right?

 MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're always talking 

12 about a murder that was intended to remove somebody who 

13 could incriminate the killer -­

16 Why isn't it enough to say you killed that person to 

17 prevent the disclosure of the crime, and if the crime 

18 was a Federal crime, the disclosure you were preventing 

19 was a disclosure to a Federal Court or to a Federal 

police officer? 

21  Why -- why do you have to create a -- a 

22 reasonable likelihood that this person, this particular 

23 person, would have gone to a Federal officer rather than 

24 a State officer? Isn't it enough to kill the person to

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, the government could 

6 more than live with it. The government could wallow in 

7 it. 

8  MS. HARRINGTON: But that -- indeed. But 

9 that is a more aggressive reading than the reading we're 

offering, because Congress went to the extra step of 

11 defining "law enforcement officer" to mean "Federal law 

12 enforcement officer." So the interpretation you're 

13 positing would essentially read that out of the statute. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but the statute reads 

it out of the statute. It says in (g) that you don't -­

16 the intent element does -- does not require that you 

17 know it's a Federal officer or that you know it's a 

18 Federal judicial proceeding. 

19  MS. HARRINGTON: Right. The reason -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't it enough that 

21 you -- you kill somebody to prevent the disclosure of a 

22 crime that's a Federal crime? 

23  MS. HARRINGTON: I mean, Congress could have 

24 written the statute that way, but when Congress defined 

"law enforcement officer" to mean "Federal law

1 enforcement officer," presumably, they meant that to 

2 mean something. And in (g)(2), what they do is they 

3 take the Federal nature of the law enforcement officer 

4 out of the mens rea part of the offense, but they 

describe it as a circumstance, and so that presumably 

6 is -- has to relate to something that could have 

7 happened in the world in the absence of the murder. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't -- if you have 

9 a Federal -- underlying Federal offense, and I gather 

you don't think -- that just needs to be shown as a 

11 matter of fact, right? 

12  MS. HARRINGTON: Correct. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No intent with 

14 respect to that.

 Isn't it always likely that there's going to 

16 be a reasonable possibility, reasonable likelihood, that 

17 the communication is going to go to a Federal officer? 

18  MS. HARRINGTON: I -­

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a Federal 

offense. If the communication covers Federal judges, 

21 that's the person who is going to try the case in every 

22 case. 

23  MS. HARRINGTON: Except that not all crimes 

24 that could be prosecuted as Federal crimes are 

prosecuted as Federal crimes. For example, there are -­

1 most drug crimes are prosecuted by State authorities 

2 rather than by Federal authorities, even though -­

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, obviously not 

4 all of them.

 MS. HARRINGTON: Not all of them. If -­

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think that -­

7 that it's not an element of the crime, but that feature 

8 of the prosecution depends upon what percentage of the 

9 crimes are prosecuted Federally as opposed to by State 

law? 

11  MS. HARRINGTON: No, it doesn't. And I 

12 think in a particular case, if the drug crime is the 

13 underlying crime, that could serve as the predicate 

14 crime. But I think that what matters is what the jury 

has reason to conclude, and jurors generally don't 

16 understand the way that the Federal system works 

17 vis-à-vis the State system. And so if there's no reason 

18 for the jury to think that the information might have 

19 gone to Federal officers, then they wouldn't have a 

basis for a conviction under the statute. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you instruct the 

22 jury that the underlying crime here is a Federal crime 

23 and then say the only thing they have to determine under 

24 some standard is whether or not the communication would 

be to a Federal officer?

1  MS. HARRINGTON: You could -- you could give

3 hypothetical from Justice Scalia to be that you wouldn't 

4 need to show that there's any -- any chance that the 

communication would have gone to a Federal officer. And 

6 I think that would read the Federal officer definition 

7 out of the statute, if all that was required was that 

8 the offense be a Federal offense. 

9  And then could you just say, well, you know, 

in theory -- and it's true that anybody who has 

11 information about a commission of a Federal offense, 

12 theoretically, could someday choose to give that 

13 information to a Federal officer, but that -­

14  JUSTICE ALITO: Let's say the case -- that 

this case arises -- exactly this case arises in two 

16 different adjacent jurisdictions. In one, the local 

17 sheriff and the local district attorney hate the Feds. 

18 They never talk to them unless they absolutely have to. 

19 And so if Officer Horner had taken the information that 

he learned to the local sheriff, there's no chance 

21 whatsoever that they would have referred that over to 

22 the FBI or the U.S. attorney for prosecution in Federal 

23 Court, so no realistic possibility there. 

24  In the other jurisdiction, right next door, 

the local sheriff and the local DA don't want to be

1 bothered with bank robbery trials. They send all of 

2 those over to the FBI and the U.S. attorney, so there's 

3 a very high probability the information would have 

4 gotten to the Federal authorities.

 Now, would this case come out differently 

6 depending on the jurisdiction? 

7  MS. HARRINGTON: I think it would, Justice 

8 Alito. I think in the first case, the jury wouldn't 

9 have a reasonable basis to conclude that the information 

might have gone to Federal officers in the absence of 

11 the murder. In the second case, they would have a very 

12 reasonable basis to make that inference. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't see what that has 

14 to do with the defendant's intent.

 MS. HARRINGTON: It doesn't have anything to 

16 do with the defendant's intent. Again, there are two 

17 different ways, in our view, to prove a violation of the 

18 statute. One is if the defendant has a specific intent 

19 about preventing communication to a specifically Federal 

officer. If the Federal nature of the officer is in his 

21 mind, that's one way to prove a violation of the 

22 statute. 

23  If he doesn't have that specific intent, 

24 which is going to be in most cases, honestly, that are 

prosecuted under the statute, then you have to prove

4 this -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then you have to change 

6 your answer -- right? Maybe you don't -- to my 

7 hypothetical where they shoot the wrong man. 

8  MS. HARRINGTON: But in your hypothetical, 

9 which I think you borrowed from Justice Alito, there was 

a specific intent to prevent a communication with the 

11 FBI, and so there they have the Federal officer specific 

12 intent. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't it rather strange, 

14 trials? It's such a weird issue to submit to the jury 

in a criminal trial, you know, whether this witness who 

16 was -- whether there's a reasonable likelihood that this 

17 person who was killed would have gone to a Federal law 

18 enforcement authority rather than the State law 

19 enforcement authority?

 MS. HARRINGTON: But the reason it's weird 

21 is because the design of the defendant in killing the 

22 victim is to prevent something from happening, and then 

23 the jury is asked to make a -- make a determination of 

24 whether that thing might have happened or not.

3 process a leg up, because you're -- if you require the

the communication in question would have happened with 

6 the Federal officer, then what you're doing is you're

two and what quantum of evidence more you would need

17  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I guess what we

19 either the government needs to prove that it's more 

likely than not that it would have happened, or they 

21 just need to prove that it's a reasonable possibility.

1  MS. HARRINGTON: The difference in proof -­

2 I mean, it depends on the particular case. Right? In 

3 many of the cases that are actually prosecuted under the 

4 statute, there's already a Federal investigation 

underway, and in those cases, this element -­

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: "Likely" is proven? 

7  MS. HARRINGTON: Easy to prove, yes. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. 

9  MS. HARRINGTON: So the cases that are at 

issue are cases like this, where the murder happens 

11 almost contemporaneously with the Federal criminal 

12 activity. And in those cases, nobody's had a chance to 

13 even think about initiating an investigation, and so -­

14 but those initial communications are vital to protecting 

the Federal interest and protecting the integrity of 

16 Federal investigations. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but you still had 

18 to prove, didn't you, or wouldn't you have a measure of 

19 obligation to have a witness get up on the stand and 

say, the FBI always looks at bank robberies? In the 

21 absence of that, aren't we asking the jury to speculate 

22 that, merely because it can be a Federal crime -- bank 

23 robbery can be both a State and a Federal -- that it's 

24 reasonably possible it would go, not everything you

2  MS. HARRINGTON: Right. And if I -- I would 

3 like to try to separate. There is the question of what 

4 is the element of the crime, how -- how do we define it, 

then what -- what is the evidence you would introduce to 

6 satisfy that element. 

7  In this case, certainly the government could 

8 have introduced evidence that -- that local law 

9 enforcement officers report all evidence of bank 

robberies to the FBI. That would have been enough. 

11 They didn't introduce that evidence. 

12  What they introduced instead was that when 

13 local law enforcement officers later got the information 

14 through other sources, they then shared the information 

with Federal officers. If they hadn't proven that, our 

16 contention is it wouldn't -- the evidence would not have 

17 been sufficient to sustain the conviction. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Miss Harrington, we -­

19 we've gotten along for over 200 years without this 

particular Federal law, and I, therefore, am not 

21 inclined to give it a -- a sweeping broad 

22 interpretation, and I think it's so weird to submit to

officer rather than a State law enforcement officer.

4 Federal proceeding, you're done? If, however, you don't 

have in mind specifically a Federal proceeding, but you 

6 have in mind a particular proceeding, which is a Federal 

7 proceeding, or a particular officer who is a Federal 

8 officer, then you're done, but anything else isn't 

9 covered?

 So the intent has to be the intent to stop a 

11 particular proceeding or -- or to stop the person going 

12 to a particular officer. If that proceeding is Federal 

13 or if the officer is Federal, you have the -- but 

14 otherwise, the laws that we've lived under for 210 years 

will continue to apply, and -- and -- and this new 

16 Federal statute will not apply. 

17  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, Justice Scalia, I 

18 think it would be insufficiently protective of the 

19 Federal interests to say that you could only -- that you 

would look at what the defendant had in mind about what 

21 the chain of communication might be if he didn't murder 

22 the person who was witnessing the crime. Most 

23 defendants don't think, wow, you know, if Officer Horner 

24 is going to call the dispatch, the dispatch is going to 

call, you know, the other person in the Haines City

1 police department, they're going to call the sheriff, 

2 they're going to call the Federal law enforcement 

3 officers, most defendants wouldn't have -- wouldn't be 

4 thinking down that -- sort of down the chain of 

communication that way. 

6  But the statute criminalizes killing someone 

7 to prevent the communication, not a communication, not a 

8 particular communication, but the communication by any 

9 person of information relating to the commission of a 

Federal crime. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: I suspect that what this 

12 mainly addressed is -- is killing of witnesses, which 

13 has become very common in some jurisdictions, witnesses 

14 in criminal trials, and you know darn well what trial is 

involved. It's a trial that's already underway, and if 

16 it's a Federal trial and you kill the witness, you're -­

17 you're liable under this statute. 

18  What -- what is covered beyond that is if -­

19 if you know that the information is going to be given to 

a Federal officer, then they have you also, but I don't 

21 know why we should read the statute any more broadly 

22 than that and -- and have these weird questions 

23 submitted to the jury how likely was it that this -­

24 this dead person would have gone to a Federal officer 

rather than a State officer and -- and inquire into the

1 question that Justice Alito asked, you know, how is 

2 there a friendly relationship between State and local 

3 officials so that the State official would -- I don't 

4 want to get into that. I don't think the juries do.

 MS. HARRINGTON: I mean, many of these 

6 things are not -- in many of these cases, this is not an 

7 element that's difficult to prove. If, as you say, it's 

8 a witness in a particular investigation or is going to 

9 testify in a particular trial who has been murdered, 

then it's easy to prove that the Federal officer nexus 

11 has been satisfied. But Congress was also trying to 

12 protect information that would cause Federal 

13 investigations to be initiated. Those are important 

14 communications.

 If you allow murders of people who witness 

16 crimes in order to prevent them from reporting that 

17 information to law enforcement officers, where the 

18 reporting of that information would have caused a 

19 Federal investigation to be initiated, then you're 

insufficiently protecting the Federal interest in 

21 prosecuting Federal crimes. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Harrington, what would 

23 be -- what would happen if instead of Officer Horner, 

24 the custodian of the cemetery had come across these 

people and the exact same thing had happened, would you 

41

1 then say that there would be -- that there would be a 

2 prosecution -- there could be a prosecution under this 

3 statute? 

4  MS. HARRINGTON: Not unless the custodian of 

the cemetery was on his cell phone saying I'm calling 

6 911. So, if we -- what's important -­

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: So is that the difference, 

8 that Officer Horner was on his cell phone? 

9  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, in terms of whether 

the evidence that was presented in this case was 

11 sufficient, it was sufficient because the jury knew two 

12 things. They knew, first, that Officer Horner 

13 definitely would have communicated the information 

14 that's relevant in the case to local law enforcement 

officers; and second, they knew that when local law 

16 enforcement officers later acquired that information 

17 from other sources, they shared it with Federal 

18 officers. 

19  So if you didn't know the first step, if you 

didn't know that definitely the person who was killed 

21 would have communicated to local law enforcement 

22 officers, then there wouldn't be a reason -- first of 

23 all, you might not have -- have the correct specific 

24 intent to prevent communication with a law enforcement 

officer which is required.

1  JUSTICE BREYER: I do have a question I 

2 would like to ask at some point. Are you finished? 

3  MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. Go ahead. 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: Because this is very 

interesting. I normally think purpose is important. In 

6 this one I don't, and suppose I'm right, purpose has 

7 nothing to do with this. The problem here is with the 

8 words "intent" and "prevent." 

9  MS. HARRINGTON: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And it's how they're used 

11 in ordinary English. So let me give you an example, 

12 even odder than Justice Alito's. But I think it 

13 illustrates the point -- the question. 

14  Imagine you put your son in his room, and 

they say why do you keep your son in his room doing his 

16 homework? Because I wanted to prevent him from going to 

17 the movies. That's why. Now, when you say that, we 

18 would impute, correctly, you wanted to prevent him from 

19 going to a Hollywood movie. You wanted to prevent him 

from going to an old movie, prevent him from going to a 

21 new movie, but prevent him from going to a Lithuanian 

22 movie? 

23  Now, why does that sound so odd? Because 

24 there's no realistic possibility that he would go to a 

Lithuanian movie. Okay.

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Now, if that's the problem, 

3 if that's the problem, the words that capture that

words "possibility." So if I have to choose between 

6 those two, and that is the problem, why don't I choose 

7 their solution? 

8  MS. HARRINGTON: I guess in our view it's 

9 less important which words you pick -­

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 

11  MS. HARRINGTON: Than it is what they mean. 

12 And, so, if by realistic -- realistic probability or 

13 realistic likelihood -­

14  JUSTICE BREYER: They use realistic 

likelihood and if someone were to tell me in my odd 

16 example there is no realistic likelihood he would go to 

17 a Lithuanian movie, that seems to describe perfectly 

18 whether I would or would not say in trying to prevent 

19 him from going to the movies, you try to prevent him 

from going to a Lithuanian movie. And your -- yours 

21 doesn't -- I mean it's a -- I agree it may not make that 

22 much difference, but we have to choose some form of 

23 words. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Understand this, you mean

2  (Laughter.) 

3  JUSTICE BREYER: No, it wouldn't have been 

4 okay, but you don't normally say of a person when a 

thing is really weird, but he wants it to happen that 

6 doesn't do it for that -- it's so unlikely. I shoot an 

7 arrow into the air hoping it will fall on my enemy. All 

8 right? It's not going to. But if it does, we say he 

9 intended it. You see, that -- that's the kind of 

linguistic problem that I think is present. 

11  MS. HARRINGTON: Right. And it's not -- it 

12 doesn't perfectly map on to the problem in this case, of 

13 course, because there is subsection (g)(2), which 

14 specifically says you take intent out of the equation. 

And, so, I'll concede it's an awkwardly constructed 

16 statutory provision. But I think the important -­

17  JUSTICE BREYER: It's not awkwardly 

18 constructed. It's trying to get odd possibilities, and 

19 if it is trying to get those odd possibilities about 

which we normally would say he did intend to prevent 

21 that from happening, then those things we're trying to 

22 leave out are those where there is no realistic 

23 possibility that they would happen.

1  JUSTICE BREYER: Then let's take their 

2 words. 

3  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, we -- again, it 

4 depends what it -- what you mean by realistic 

possibility or likelihood. If you mean more likely than 

6 not, then we would say that's too high a burden on the 

7 government. We want to include odd possibilities but 

8 not outlandish possibilities. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure I 

understand your answer to Justice Kagan's hypothetical. 

11 We -- we -- there's no proof that this particular 

12 officer who was shot was going to pick up the phone to 

13 the FBI. He may have overheard this. He would have 

14 called his fellow officers, and somebody, probably his 

supervisor, or the DA's office was going to make the 

16 decision whether to call the FBI. So, how is that 

17 different from the cemetery caretaker, who is going to 

18 call it in probably to 9-1-1, and he doesn't 

19 particularly have an idea of who's going to get involved 

or not because it's really not his issue. Why is there 

21 a difference between those two situations? And isn't 

22 the question, going back to what Justice Breyer asked, 

23 was, what's the likelihood that this is going to get 

24 investigated by the Federal Government? Why is it 

reasonably possible? Anything is reasonably possible -­

1 or almost anything. 

2  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I mean, we -- we 

3 attach the word reasonably to possible to sort of to 

4 wall off cases that are theoretically possible, right? 

So again, we would like to cover odd occurrences but not 

6 outlandish occurrences, so it's not just anything that's 

7 possible. It's -- the jury has to have a reason to 

8 think it might have happened in this case. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I guess then your 

burden is only to show that it's a Federal offense, 

11 because why you need to show anything else because 

12 "reasonably possible" encompasses every single Federal 

13 offense or anything that could be termed a Federal 

14 offense.

 MS. HARRINGTON: With respect, Your Honor, 

16 we don't -- we don't think that's correct. I think 

17 there needs to be a reason for the jury to think that if 

18 this communication had not been prevented, the 

19 information eventually would have gone to Federal 

officers. The reason -­

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But why isn't that 

22 -- maybe I asked this already, but why isn't that the 

23 case when you're dealing with the Federal offense? 

24  MS. HARRINGTON: Because, the reality is 

that not information -- that all local law enforcement

 MS. HARRINGTON: There's a possibility, but 

6 I think -­

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A realistic 

8 possibility. 

9  MS. HARRINGTON: And again that's -- if 

that's how the Court wanted to go, that's something the 

11 government could live with. But -­

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did you say before that 

13 -- that presenting this to the jury; everybody's worried 

14 about what the jury will think; that when Gamble came 

and confessed, the local official went to -- to the 

16 Federal? I think we were told that there was a year 

17 lapse between when the local police knew about Gamble's 

18 confession and when -­

19  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, there's a 10-month 

lapse between when Gamble went to the local law 

21 enforcement officers and when Gamble testified before 

22 the Federal grand jury. So presumably the Federal -­

23 the AUSA was brought in sometime in that 10-month 

24 period. So, it wasn't that long a lapse.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you know what the 

48

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 difference was between the State and the Federal 

2 penalties? 

3  MS. HARRINGTON: I don't know the 

4 difference. I mean, Gamble when he was -- hew was 

indicted eventually for 14 Federal offenses to which he 

6 pled guilty and was sentenced initially to life plus 107 

7 years. Some of the -- some of the crimes for which he 

8 was indicted could not have been prosecuted in State 

9 court; but presumably he could have gotten a life 

sentence for murdering a police officer if he had been 

11 prosecuted in State court as well. 

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: So Ms. Harrington, suppose 

13 Officer Horner had come to the scene and instead of 

14 seeing evidence that there was a robbery about to occur, 

had seen evidence only of drug use. Now that might be a 

16 Federal offense, but typically it wouldn't be prosecuted 

17 in -- in a Federal court. Would you say then that the 

18 statute is not satisfied? 

19  MS. HARRINGTON: No, we would say it is 

satisfied if everything else was the same. 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: Because? 

22  MS. HARRINGTON: Because it -- it's still 

23 information relating to the commission or possible 

24 commission of a Federal offense, we still know that 

Officer Horner definitely would have transmitted that 

49

1 information to local law enforcement officers, and we

4 transmitted it to Federal -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Oh, but that's 4 years 

6 later. That was way past the time when this incident 

7 occurred. 

8  MS. HARRINGTON: It's true. And just to be 

9 clear, we're not saying that that communication that 

happened in 2002 is the communication that was prevented 

11 or intended to be prevented. What we're saying is that 

12 the fact when local cops got the information in 2002, 

13 they shared it with Federal officers, that that's a 

14 reason for the jury to infer that they would have done 

the same thing if they had gotten the information -­

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: You're saying the fact that 

17 they got this information 4 years later, shared it with 

18 law enforcement officers after they knew that a murder 

19 had occurred as a result of an incident would be the 

same kind of inquiry that they would make at that time? 

21  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I think -­

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Before the murder? 

23  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, of course, we don't 

24 know what would have happened, because Officer Horner 

was murdered to prevent any of this from happening, but

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 in fact, the evidence before the jury suggested that it 

2 wasn't the murder that motivated them to share the 

3 information with Federal officers; it was one of the 

4 underlying robberies. It was the robbery of the Holiday 

Inn, which was a Federal offense. The statute of 

6 limitations had run on that in State court, and so they 

7 wanted to -- but they wanted to maximize the amount of 

8 charges they could bring against Chris Gamble. And so 

9 they decided to share that information with Federal 

officers. 

11  So it wasn't the murder that made the 

12 difference; it was one of the underlying Federal 

13 offenses that was charged against -- as one of the 

14 predicate crimes against Petitioner here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would -- would you not 

16 acknowledge that the statute is vague enough that the 

17 intent which it requires could be either the intent to 

18 prevent testimony from being given to a particular 

19 Federal proceeding or to a particular Federal officer or 

the specific intent to withhold it from a proceeding or 

21 an officer who happens to be or which happens to be 

22 Federal, but which the defendant is not aware is 

23 Federal? It could bear that meaning, couldn't it? 

24  MS. HARRINGTON: It could, but Justice 

Scalia, I want to point out that subsections (A) and (B) 

51
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 of (a)(1), those are the provisions that talk about 

2 official proceedings. Subsection (a)(1)(C), which is 

3 the provision that's at issue here, does not talk about 

4 official proceedings. It talks about transferring 

information to Federal -- to law enforcement officers or 

6 to judges. And so there doesn't -- I think by -- just 

7 by reading, sort of a plain reading of those provisions 

8 together means that for subsection (C), you don't need 

9 to have an official proceeding that was in anyone's mind 

or that was underway at the time. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I acknowledge that, but 

12 a particular judge or -- or the conduct of a Federal 

13 proceeding, it could -- it could require specific intent 

14 of a proceeding or a judge or an officer which happens 

to be a Federal officer. 

16  MS. HARRINGTON: It could, yes, and again, I 

17 think if the defendant has a Federal officer specific 

18 intent in mind when he commits the murder, that's 

19 enough.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So if a defendant has in 

21 mind a particular officer, then there's a potential 

22 violation of the statute, but if the defendant just 

23 kills for the purpose of preventing this from going to 

24 any Federal -- any officer who might happen to be a 

Federal officer, then there's no violation under this -­

question as it was put to me.

1 find that the mere presence of a possible Federal 

2 offense was appropriate to give Federal jurisdiction 

3 under this particular statute, then I would ask the 

4 Court to consider the effect that that would have on 

criminal practice throughout this country. 

6  There is significant overlap between Federal 

7 and State criminal laws, and if we are simply going to 

8 confer Federal jurisdiction on this particular statute 

9 because of the mere possibility of a Federal offense, 

you have created a huge exception and, we would 

11 respectfully submit, create problems for that delicate 

12 balance between State and Federal. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What's delicate about 

14 robbery? I mean, robbery is completely a Federal crime, 

and that was what the -- that was what Horner observed, 

16 and they were -- they were planning for the robbery the 

17 next day. 

18  MR. CRAWFORD: Justice Ginsburg, we would 

19 agree that bank robbery is a Federal crime. The 

question is: Is there any evidence in the record that 

21 would show there was going to be any Federal involvement 

22 in that Federal crime? Every day, Federal crimes are
