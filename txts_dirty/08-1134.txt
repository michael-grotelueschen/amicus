CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-1134, United Student Aid Funds 

v. Espinosa. 

Ms. Wanslee. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MADELEINE C. WANSLEE 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. WANSLEE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Congress has precisely delineated three 

types of debt in bankruptcy: those that are 

dischargeable, those that are dischargeable unless the 

creditor timely objects, and those debts that are simply 

not dischargeable. Student loans fall within a subset 

of this third category. Their exception from discharge 

is self-executing unless a debtor proves that 

repayment will cause an undue hardship on the debtor and 

the debtor's dependents. The Ninth Circuit rewrote 

Bankruptcy Code section 523 to reduce those three types 

of debt down to two. Allowing debtors to discharge 

their student loan debts by mere declaration opens the 

door to recategorizing every category of 

non-dischargeable debt, and that includes --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Only -- only -- only if the

bankruptcy court disregards the law. I mean, it's --

it's clear that the bankruptcy court should not have 

done what it did here. The only issue is, it having 

made that mistake, can it -- can it subsequently be --

be undone in the manner that's -- that's sought here? 

They haven't reduced three to two. The 

three -- the three remain three. The bankruptcy court 

should not do this. 

MS. WANSLEE: Your Honor, this case turns 

upon the effect of section 1328. And the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before -- before we get 

to that, the Ninth Circuit did say, now, bankruptcy 

judges, we don't want you to -- to intermeddle in this. 

So -- so the first step -- it wasn't clear to the Ninth 

Circuit that bankruptcy judges should not say, now, I am 

not going to let you do this until you prove hardship. 

MS. WANSLEE: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the 

Ninth Circuit said that bankruptcy courts have no 

business involving themselves in this dispute if the 

creditor fails to object. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 

MS. WANSLEE: And the problem here is that 

1328 specifically says that the effect of the discharge, 

the discharge that every debtor is looking for in a 

chapter 13 case, that discharge shall not include

non-dischargeable debt. And the language is very, very 

important, Your Honor. It prescribes the statutory 

effect of the discharge order, and it says that after a 

debtor completes their payments under a plan, open 

quote, "the court shall grant the debtor a discharge of 

all debts provided for by the plan, except any debt of 

the kind specified in paragraph 8." 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It was wrong. Let's 

assume --

MS. WANSLEE: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the circuit -- the 

district court judge, the bankruptcy court judge, got it 

wrong, legal error. Should not have been discharged, a 

given. Neither -- the confirmation plan should not have 

been approved, neither should the discharge order have 

been entered. We will go back to what was entered 

and -- and -- and the effect of that, because I'm not 

sure of it -- it's an error. 

How does that give you a right to undo that 

judgment 7 years later -- was it 5, 6, 7 years later? 

That's the question here. Why is something that's in 

error become a void judgment? 

MS. WANSLEE: Justice Sotomayor, it's not 

mere error. It's in fact void because of the plain 

language of these particular specific statutes. They

have very precise words, very precise meanings. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But so does -- most 

error committed by courts, inadvertently or otherwise, 

are in contravention of some statutory command. This is 

no different. 

Voidness, as I've heard it described by many 

others, appears to mean that the court is acting either 

without jurisdiction over the people, and that's not at 

issue here -- there was jurisdiction over the parties 

here -- or without jurisdiction over the res. But the 

bankruptcy court does have jurisdiction, albeit in 

some -- in all circumstances, it had jurisdiction over 

the student debt. The issue is what could it do with 

it. But this is not a case involving a lack of 

jurisdiction by the court over property. 

So why is this more than mere error? 

MS. WANSLEE: Because Congress's statutory 

scheme must be enforced as written. And it's -- it's 

unequivocal here what Congress wants. Congress has 19 

categories of debts that are excepted from discharge, 

important exceptions: Alimony, child support --

JUSTICE BREYER: What's the strongest case, 

I mean, that you can muster in favor of this 

proposition, my question being the same as Justice 

Sotomayor's? What’s the strongest case where you can

find any court that said a matter is void -- it’s void, 

not -- not just legal error, so you can attack it 90 

years later -- it's void just because the lower court 

that made the error didn't apply a clear statute? 

MS. WANSLEE: Rule --

JUSTICE BREYER: Give me your strongest case. 

MS. WANSLEE: Your Honor, Rule 60 says that 

void orders can be attacked, and the passage of time 

does not transmute a void order into a valid order. 

Once void, it --

JUSTICE BREYER: But I’d like an answer 

to my question, because I can -- I have read the 

treatises, which I have in front of me, and they say 

that it's void only if you show a -- the same thing that 

Justice Sotomayor just said. And so, since I don't 

think there is some kind of constitutional due process 

error here, and there’s clearly jurisdiction over the 

parties, I guess you are saying there wasn't subject 

matter jurisdiction, which is a little vague. 

And so I want to know what's the clearest 

case, strongest for you, where a court has ever said 

that a failure of some -- of some other court to apply 

the language of a statute properly, no matter how clear, 

is a lack of subject matter jurisdiction? What is your 

strongest precedent? That's all I'm asking.

MS. WANSLEE: Your Honor, we did cite a 

number of cases in the materials. One of them is the 

Vallely case, in which --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 

MS. WANSLEE: That was the insurance company 

case. Congress said that insurance companies could not be 

afforded the protections of bankruptcy. And in that 

case, the president of the company, the secretary of the 

company, all participated in the bankruptcy. But the 

Court found that the bankruptcy court had no authority 

to -- to issue orders and to have that insurance company 

within the bankruptcy context. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that -- that goes back 

to something more fundamental. There’s no issue here 

that the court had jurisdiction over these parties, 

unlike the insurance company. And there’s no issue that 

the court didn't have jurisdiction over this res. They 

could decide that a student loan was dischargeable. 

They just had to follow certain procedures. It's a very 

different set of circumstances in that case. 

MS. WANSLEE: Well, Your Honor, if -- if 

this order is merely voidable, then why do we have 

section 523(c)? 523 -- a very specific code provision: 

All debts not included in 523 are as a matter of course 

discharged through bankruptcy. Those that are

specifically enumerated, except for (2), (4), and (6), are 

excepted from discharge -- (2), (4), and (6), the 

creditor must timely file objection. 

Why do we have that scheme? Why do we have 

the tripart ordering? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can a -- can a creditor 

say, oh, skip it, I know this bankrupt is going to be 

able to prove hardship, why go through unnecessary 

expense? Can a -- can a creditor waive the hardship 

determination? 

MS. WANSLEE: No, Your Honor, a creditor may 

not waive the undue hardship determination. 523 says 

that student loans are only discharged upon a finding of 

undue hardship. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So he can't -- he can't 

stipulate to -- he will say: I want the deal that is 

being proposed; I think I am better off getting the 

principal, skipping the interest. I can't make that 

deal? We have to go through this hardship procedure, 

whether the creditor wants it or not? 

MS. WANSLEE: Your Honor, within the proper 

context of an adversary proceeding in which the issue 

has in fact been raised. Here, there was never any --

any allegation of undue hardship, never.

Because, once again 523, requires a finding. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: It would not have been 

different then? What if it had been not only an 

allegation but an affidavit? Would the case be 

different? 

MS. WANSLEE: Once again, I -- I think you 

go back to the language of 1328, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I’m kind of curious to 

know what your answer to my question is. 

MS. WANSLEE: I apologize. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Would the case be 

different if the Petitioner had filed an affidavit of 

undue hardship with the papers? Same notice, everything 

else exactly the same. 

MS. WANSLEE: Certainly a harder case, Your 

Honor. However, I don't --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Why is it a harder case? 

MS. WANSLEE: I don't think -- there would 

not have been an adjudication of undue hardship, 

however. Just because the debtor stated it doesn't mean 

there was then --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Supported by -- would then 

the case be different? 

MS. WANSLEE: No, Your Honor. There has to 

be --

JUSTICE STEVENS: There has to be an 

adversary hearing under your view? 

MS. WANSLEE: Under our view, the creditor 

is entitled to the protections of 7001 to say --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay. So if there's not 

only an affidavit, but an offer of proof, and then 

there's no answer filed and nothing in response to the 

notice of the -- the lender did exactly what it did 

here. 

MS. WANSLEE: No, Your Honor. I -- I don't 

believe that undue hardship would be established under 

those facts. Our facts, of course, are a little bit 

easier. There was never even an allegation of undue 

hardship --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

MS. WANSLEE: -- much less proof. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But your legal theory 

would be the same if there had been an affidavit filed

MS. WANSLEE: That's correct, Your Honor. 

And I would -- I would note --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what -- what if 

the creditor is sitting in the courtroom and has 

actually made arguments and appeared in some other 

aspects of the case? Then they come to the student loan 

and the -- and it's ordered discharged without any 

hearing, with the creditor sitting there. The case 

goes to judgment, there’s a final decree of discharge. 

Can the debtor -- pardon me. Can the creditor come in 

10 years later and say, oh, this is void? 

MS. WANSLEE: I think they can, Your Honor. 

And I think we can look to this Court's own precedent in 

the Stoll case. The Stoll case said that it's important 

to know when litigation begins and when it ends. And 

usually this Court's opinions talk about the ending of 

litigation. What we are talking about here is the 

beginning. We want to know --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about -- what 

about my question? 

MS. WANSLEE: Your Honor, at that point the 

litigation has not commenced. There is no summons, 

there is no service --

hypothetical is there is -- it has commenced. 

It’s a big hearing. There's lots of issues. The 

student loan creditor is there, actually participates in 

some of the hearings on other issues. Then, while they 

-- while they are still there, still represented, the 

judge says: Now, I'm going to discharge the student 

debt; I'm not going to have any hearing. The creditor 

does nothing. Can the creditor come in 10 years later 

and say this is a void judgment? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That’s this case. The 

creditor was there. The creditor put in a proof of 

claim. The creditor knew that the plan gave the 

creditor less than the proof of claim. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, my case is just a 

little different in that the creditor is there in the 

courtroom represented. 

MS. WANSLEE: Okay. And a proof of claim is 

merely for distribution purposes under a chapter 13 

finding. It's not for discharge purposes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about my --

of access and due process. Due process also requires 

compliance with whatever --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think --

MS. WANSLEE: -- Congress --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that's an astounding 

-- an astounding conclusion, that there -- that you 

simply are writing out the doctrine of -- of waiver 

altogether. 

MS. WANSLEE: Well, Your Honor, the 

exception to discharge is self-executing. And if it's 

self-executing, how can we waive it? If there is no 

duty to object --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what provision 

was this discharge under? 

MS. WANSLEE: The debtor's discharge was 

entered under section 1328(a)(2). 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And 1328 says: "The 

court shall grant a debtor a discharge." That doesn't 

sound self-executing to me. 

MS. WANSLEE: Well, but 1328 further goes on 

to say: "A discharge of all debts provided for by the 

plan" -- as this debt was provided for by the plan --

"except any debt of a kind specified in paragraph 8 of 

section 523."

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: (a), and section 

523(a) does not refer to a discharge under 1328(a). It 

refers to a discharge under 1328(b). 

MS. WANSLEE: That's correct, Your Honor. 

1328(a)(2) is the discharge in play here, and 1328(a)(2) 

brings in the discharge provisions of 523. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no. 

1328(a)(2) brings in the definition, the kind of debt 

specified in 523(a). It doesn't bring in the discharge 

under 523(a), which is limited to 1328(b). 

MS. WANSLEE: It brings in the enumerated 

debts of 523. 

And I think it's important to -- to remember 

that back in 1990 student loan debts were fully 

dischargeable in chapter 13 plans. In 1992, when this 

plan was proposed, Mr. Espinosa sought to claw back what 

Congress had taken away 2 years earlier. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- we're conceding 

that they violated the statute, the bankruptcy judge. 

The question is whether it's void. And void, as you 

just said, was three categories: One, was there a 

violation of basic due process for your client? I don't 

see it. Two, did the bankruptcy judge have jurisdiction 

over the parties? It seems the answer is yes. And, 

three, did they have subject matter jurisdiction? Which

we started by saying was vague. 

So I asked you for your strongest case. You 

said Vallely. I have only looked at it quickly, but 

it's only four pages. And what that case seems to say 

is that there is a statute which says there is 

bankruptcy jurisdiction over all commercial businesses 

except for insurance companies and two other categories. 

This party here is an insurance company, and 

and therefore they can attack it later, because there 

was no jurisdiction over an insurance company. 

Now, if that's your strongest case, I don't 

know what the others are going to say, but it seems to 

me you don't have much precedental support to put this 

in a category of lacking jurisdiction. 

MS. WANSLEE: Your Honor, we are talking 

about a statutory right here, and the fact that Congress 

has specifically provided that certain categories of 

debts, for very important public policy reasons, are 

carved out from discharge. And the reason it's void is 

because it violates the plain language of the statute. 

Again, even if it's provided for by the plan, the 

discharge this debtor got under 1328 --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why -- why should it be 

void, looking at 1327? We have a confirmed plan. You ­

- you have -- 1328 does include -- except 523(a), as you

pointed out. But 1327 says "Effect of 

confirmation," and that says, "The provisions of a 

confirmed plan" -- the provision here is you get 13,000, 

not 17,000 -- "bind the debtor and each creditor, 

whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided 

for by the plan" -- which it wasn't in full here -- "and 

whether or not such creditor has objected to or has 

accepted or rejected the plan." 

That seems to say at the end of the line, 

you get that final determination confirmed, that's it. 

That's as final as you come and whatever mistakes were 

made on the way there, you can't look behind at the 

confirmation. 

MS. WANSLEE: Your Honor, I’d like to 

reserve some time. 

But, Justice Ginsburg, to answer your 

question, 1327 is the more general -- general 

provision. Statutory canons provide that the more 

specific shall control. But there’s three other quick 

reasons I’d like to give you. 

If this case relies just on 1327, it 

deprives the Bankruptcy Code and the rules of a coherent 

effect. There are four other provisions implicated: 

1322, 1325, 1328, and 523. A ruling in Mr. Espinosa's 

favor undermines the will of Congress in this regard.

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

MR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Section 1328 and section 523 are best 

construed as self-executing limitations on the effect of 

the bankruptcy court's discharge order rather than as 

directives to the bankruptcy court. There are two 

reasons for --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't -- sorry to 

start -- stop you at the beginning, but I don't see 

that. I see in 1328(a) it says the court “shall 

grant” the debtor. And that is not self-executing. It's 

a directive to the court. And I see that 523(a) is 

referred to later on, but only for purposes of 

definition, not for purposes of discharge. 

MR. HEYTENS: Two responses to that, Mr. 

Chief Justice. First, if we are looking just at the 

language of 1328, which is reproduced at the page 3 of 

the appendix to the blue brief, it states, as the Chief

Justice notes, that: "The court shall grant the debtor 

a discharge" of certain debts. There is then a comma, 

and it says "except any debt" -- now, I can see that 

that language is subject to a degree of ambiguity. But 

I think even that language is susceptible to being read 

as a legal limitation on the effect of the discharge 

order that the provision has just told the court to 

grant. In other words, the reason that –-

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then the key 

distinction you draw in your brief is totally 

meaningless. You say on page 18 that this -- the issue 

is whether the provision is, quote, “framed as a 

directive” to the bankruptcy court. And here it is 

framed as a directive to the bankruptcy court, and 

therefore doesn't -- isn't self-executing. 

MR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, I think the 

provision before the comma clearly is framed as a 

directive to the bankruptcy court. What I’m suggesting 

is that the language after the comma is at least capable 

of being read consistent with --

JUSTICE SCALIA: There are a lot of commas. 

What comma are you referring to? 

MR. HEYTENS: Excuse me, Justice Scalia. I 

am referring to the comma in -- in 1328(a), the last comma 

right before the (1), "except any debt."

And the reason that we think that has to be 

construed as a limitation on the scope of the bankruptcy 

court's discharge order is twofold. First and foremost, 

there has been no suggestion whatsoever that there is a 

different rule for chapter 13 plans, which is covered by 

1328, than there is for chapter 7 bankruptcies, chapter 

11 bankruptcies, or chapter 12 bankruptcies. But the 

consequences of saying that 1328 alone is not a 

limitation, that is the consequence that that would 

have. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the 

consequence of -- there happen to be -- well, I counted --

14 different kinds of things that follow that comma, 

including criminal fines, sentences. There are all 

kinds of things. And is it the consequence of my 

accepting your argument that anybody who is a creditor 

in respect to any of those 14 things can come in at any 

time and announce under Rule 60(b)(4), even if it's 10 

years later, that the district court -- the bankruptcy 

court made a mistake? 

MR. HEYTENS: Well, Justice --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that would be quite --

to me -- extraordinary. So I hope the answer from your 

point of view must still be no. 

MR. HEYTENS: Well, Justice Breyer, it

wouldn't be under Rule 60(b)(4), because if you 

understand this is a limitation on the effect of the 

discharge order, the original discharge order never 

covers it in the first place. And I think quite the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Wait a moment. What would it 

be in the case where you have a discharge order and it 

says things in it which somebody feels fall within 1 

of these 13 categories? Now, are you saying that that 

somebody can come back and make his argument 15 years 

later, because he will say that, since it falls in that 

category, the judgment is void insofar as this language 

covers what I don't want it to cover? 

MR. HEYTENS: Well, Justice Breyer, there 

are three very specific categories of somebodies who 

can't do that, and Congress has specifically identified 

those three categories. 

In 523(c), Congress specifically identified 

three categories of non-dischargeable debt for which the 

onus is on the creditor to request a hearing and obtain 

a determination by the bankruptcy court. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's not -- it's not 

that it is not dischargeable. It's only dischargeable 

under certain conditions. 

MR. HEYTENS: That is true with regard to 

student loan debt, Justice --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So -- so 

you’re almost begging the question, because it's 

possible to argue that if a debt is not dischargeable at 

all under any circumstance, your argument might have 

more legs because then the court has no jurisdiction 

over that property. 

MR. HEYTENS: That was --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's not the case 

with these exceptions. They can all be discharged. 

It's just a matter of whether the conditions have been 

met or not. 

MR. HEYTENS: That would certainly be the 

argument that would be made in future cases, if the 

Court were to accept Mr. Espinosa's argument. And to be 

clear, the consequences of accepting it and not 

accepting that limitation would be that this would not 

be limited to student loans. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, but you see, it's the 

same problem that’s bothering us. I would like a yes 

or no answer. 

MR. HEYTENS: The answer is --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is it the case if somebody 

feels the conditions were not met with in the 13 

categories that -- or 14 -- that follow the comma, he --

you feel that they were met. The other side says, they

balloon, okay. You know, was the notice a real notice, 

wasn't it? People argue about that. 

So in any case where you have a person who 

says, no, they weren't met, and the other side says, 

yes, they were met, that first person can come back 

13 years later and say that the judgment was void? Is 

the answer of the government yes or no? 

MR. HEYTENS: With the exception of the 

three categories in (c), the answer is yes, Justice 

Breyer, and we think that follows straightforwardly from 

the --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Is there any --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is (c)? You have 

been talking about 523(c). I can't find it in any of 

the materials. 

MR. HEYTENS: Justice Scalia, we discussed 

page -- 523(c) on pages 13 to 14 of our brief.

I’ve got to search through your brief for it? 

What page in your brief?

can read it. It states "the debtor shall be 

discharged from a debt of a kind specified in paragraphs 

(2), (4), or (6) of subparagraph (a) … unless, on request 

of the creditor to whom such debt is owed, and after 

notice and a hearing, the court determines” that such 

debt is to be excepted under (2), (4), or (6). 

So for those three categories of otherwise 

non-dischargeable debt, Congress has specifically 

provided that the onus is on the creditor to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I just get your answer 

to a similar question --

MR. HEYTENS: Sure. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- I asked your colleague? 

If the facts of this case were changed by the -- the 

creditor had come in and stipulated to the plan before 

the court and explained at the time, we think it would 

be better to get what money's available now rather than 

waiting for the interest to be collected later on, if 

they had stipulated to it, and then the order was 

entered, you would still say, 10 years later, they could 

charge it? 

MR. HEYTENS: With -- with one caveat, 

Justice Stevens, which I -- I don't mean to fight the 

hypothetical. I just think I need to clarify. The 

creditor can certainly stipulate to the underlying facts

that the debtor alleges in support --

JUSTICE STEVENS: He stipulates to the entry 

of the plan. That's all he stipulates to. 

MR. HEYTENS: Justice Stevens, in that 

situation, there has not been an undue hardship 

determined --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So you -- you would have the 

same position then? 

MR. HEYTENS: We would say yes, and we think 

that follows naturally from this Court's decision in 

Hood, where the Court clearly described 523(8)(a) as a 

self-executing limitation. The Court specifically 

said it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the only way to do it 

is to go through an adversary hearing with full notice, 

and every -- and nobody wants to incur that expense. 

This is a bankruptcy. You are trying to save assets. 

The bankruptcy judge thinks this makes no sense. The 

creditor says, okay. But you -- you agree with your 

colleague that, under this 523 whatever, you must have 

the full adversary hearing, notice, complaint, the 

works? 

MR. HEYTENS: Justice Ginsburg, you don't 

necessarily need to have the full adversary hearing. 

What you have to have is what Congress provided for in

523(a)(8). You have to have an undue hardship 

determination that is made by the bankruptcy court. 

Now, the parties can stipulate to the 

underlying facts. But as this Court said in Hood, even 

if the creditor does not show up for the adversary 

proceeding, if the creditor completely defaults, this 

Court said, on pages 453 and 454 of Hood, the bankruptcy 

court still cannot discharge that debt --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the irony of your 

position is it's in the creditor's interest to get what 

is available at this time, rather than waiting 10 years 

hoping to get interest later on, and even though that's 

the fact, you cannot give relief in this situation. 

MR. HEYTENS: Well, Justice Stevens, the 

creditor certainly does have interests. But I think the 

reason Congress would provide for this regime is that 

there is an important public interest at stake here, 

too, which is that the Department of Education is 

reinsuring all of these student loans. 

And there is a powerful interest in ensuring 

the integrity of the student loan system as a whole, 

that, regardless of the decisions that an individual 

debtor and perhaps an individual creditor are willing to 

make in particular cases, Congress has an overriding 

policy that student loans should not be discharged

unless there is a determination that this is the 

extraordinary case, rather than the ordinary. 

Now, there’s a very practical reason why 

this matters. There were 374,000 chapter 13 filings 

last year. There is no such thing as a standard form 

chapter 13 plan. 

The logical consequences of affirming the 

Ninth Circuit's judgment in this case is to tell every 

single chapter 13 debtor who has a student loan debt to 

include a provision like this in his plan, in the hopes 

that the creditor will not object and he will be able to 

obtain a discharge in the absence of any finding by the 

bankruptcy court. 

It won't just be limited to chapter 13 

debtors, either. It will apply to any debtor who has 

a non-dischargeable --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't bankruptcy courts 

read the law? 

MR. HEYTENS: Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you’ve got to assume that 

every bankruptcy court is going to violate the 

provisions of the statute. 

MR. HEYTENS: Well, first and foremost, 

Justice Scalia, the Ninth Circuit has specifically 

forbidden bankruptcy courts from doing that on pages

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, they may not have said it 

right, but they -- but they -- that’s a different 

problem. But the -- the -- why doesn't the Treasury 

just say to people: We’re not going to insure your 

loans where you don't object. 

MR. HEYTENS: They -- the Department of 

Education --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then the 

government is harmless. 

MR. HEYTENS: Well, it’s not harmless, 

Justice Stevens -- I'm sorry, Justice Breyer, excuse 

me -- because the question is: Who does it make sense to 

put the onus on? Now, to your question -- the 

bankruptcy judges can do it. 

There were 374,000 filings last year. There 

are less than 350 bankruptcy judges in this country. 

That means more than 1,000 chapter 13 plans for every 

single bankruptcy judge in the country. The idea that 

bankruptcy judges are going to be policing every single 

chapter 13 plan, it's just not realistic, and I don't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why, of course, they 

are supposed to police --

have to have a charade hearing is -- is equally

consistent with the normal rules of civil litigation

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. MEEHAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

Last term, in Travelers, this Court held 

that, if the plain terms of a confirmed 11 plan 

unambiguously apply to a particular issue, they are 

entitled to their effect. That is this case, I submit. 

Now, the case did go on to acknowledge that 

there can be some situations in which the finality is 

not going to be found -- it said subject matter per se 

is not one of those -- but that if the court's action 

was so plainly beyond its jurisdiction as to be a 

manifest abuse of authority -- and this was not 

necessary to the holding, I suppose, but it was 

described in kind of where we would be in terms of

exceptions -- then perhaps finality would not apply. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you acknowledge that 

what the bankruptcy court did here was wrong? Do you 

acknowledge that? 

MR. MEEHAN: I acknowledge that it did 

violate the statute. And I would --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. And it should not 

have done it, and future bankruptcy courts shouldn't do 

it? 

MR. MEEHAN: I think that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It makes a big difference 

to how I’m going to look on this case. I mean, if you –-

MR. MEEHAN: I would agree that that is 

correct, Your Honor. The reason I hesitate is this: 

Mr. Heytens said that there are, on average, 1,000 

chapter 13 plans filed per bankruptcy judge every year. 

The bankruptcy judges do and are entitled to have 

creditors make objections. Indeed, I think that Justice 

Stevens was right that if a creditor and a debtor wanted 

to come in and stipulate that there would be a discharge 

of a portion of the student loan without a finding of 

undue hardship, then certainly they can do so. 

I don't --

bankruptcy judge to identify a particular debt as a

student loan debt? I mean, would the bankruptcy 

filing -- filing show it -- you know, student loan debt? 

MR. MEEHAN: As far as I know, it would. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It would? 

MR. MEEHAN: And there may be circumstances 

in which there is student loan debt which is not one of 

the two plans that are guaranteed by the Department of 

Education because Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MR. MEEHAN: -- has broadened it, so that may 

be the case. But I think this case obviously was such a

arrangements. Because you -- your answer was you think 

the bankruptcy judge does have the obligation to bring 

out this requirement that -- of a hardship showing?

"obligation," perhaps I was a little imprecise. Let me 

put it this way: Number one, I am not here to say, nor 

have we ever said at any stage of this litigation, that 

this plan complied with 523(a)(8). That's clear. 

Number two, if there had been any objection 

raised whatsoever at any time, then it would obviously 

have been wrong for the bankruptcy judge to confirm the 

plan. 

JUSTICE ALITO: What if there’s no 

objection? The bankruptcy judge sees a chapter 13 plan, 

and it -- it provides for the discharge of student debt; 

it covers student debt. It's labeled "student debt." 

Is it improper for the bankruptcy judge to 

say you can't do this by this mechanism, you have to 

start an adversary proceeding? 

MR. MEEHAN: I do not think it is improper 

for the bankruptcy judge to act that way, because under 

section --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't hear. Proper --

MR. MEEHAN: I do not think -- I'm sorry. I 

do not think it would be improper. I think, under 

section 105 of the code, indeed, the bankruptcy court 

has what I would analogize as sort of the All Writs Act, 

which says that the bankruptcy court may act sua sponte 

to enforce --

to say that that is what he ought to do. 

MR. MEEHAN: Well, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And you’re not willing to 

say that. You’re willing to say that bankruptcy courts 

can do that if they like, but, you know, if they have a 

kid that has a lot of bankruptcy debts, he has a soft 

heart for student loan debts, he sees this as a student 

loan debt, all right, let's give this kid a break. And 

he enters -- that's okay? 

MR. MEEHAN: No, I balance -- I balance your 

question against Justice Stevens's hypothetical, and 

only in the circumstance where it is clear either 

through extensive notice, and I say waiver here, or 

through an actual stipulation -- only in those 

circumstances would it be appropriate for a bankruptcy 

court to confirm a plan. 

And even then, I submit, under section 105, 

if the bankruptcy court said I will not do so, the 

bankruptcy court need not do so, and in fact -- in fact, 

the bankruptcy judge here, Judge Hollowell, when she 

denied United relief under Rule 60, said that she as a 

bankruptcy judge would not have done so. And that is 

certainly within their authority to do. And Justice

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you would say it's wrong 

for the bankruptcy court to do it without a waiver, and --

but you’re leaving open if there is a clear waiver, 

despite the fact of no adversary proceeding -- you’re 

not -- you’re not necessarily willing to say that the 

bankruptcy court can't do that? 

MR. MEEHAN: Yes, because -- let me back up 

and talk perhaps a little more generally. 

I mean, in litigation in general, parties are 

free to stipulate away or to decide not to litigate an 

element of a claim. If they, in fact, do that, most 

judges would say that's fine. Now, in this instance, 

again -- and I don't want to be too repetitious -- but 

in this instance, the bankruptcy judge does have that 

extra “well, no,” I read this as being something that's 

too important for me to let the parties stipulate away. 

That's the only reason that I don't go completely with 

your hypothetical. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Was the Ninth Circuit 

correct in saying that an attorney can't be sanctioned 

under the bankruptcy rules' equivalent version of Rule 

11, for attempting to sneak through a discharge of 

student debt in a chapter 13 petition?

don't have a case here of sneaking through. I do want 

to make that point. This was clear notice. 

Number two, I think the bankruptcy court --

excuse me, the Ninth Circuit was not wrong, because in 

the Ninth Circuit, there was binding precedent, the Pardee 

case. 

JUSTICE ALITO: No, I understand that. But in 

the absence of circuit -- controlling circuit precedent, 

is it -- can an attorney be sanctioned for attempting to 

get the discharge of student debt through a chapter 13 

petition, knowing, as I assume every bankruptcy attorney

discharge of a student debt -- student loan?

not the case.

Ninth Circuit law is.

just don't have a Federal case out of an undue hardship 

determination for $4,000 -- that it does not violate 

Rule 11 or 9011 to make that proposal. 

If there is some sort of lack of candor or 

if there's some sort of weaseling, one might say 

perhaps. And I think it's interesting that those 

courts which have said that this is not something that 

bankruptcy lawyers should do have not, so far as I was 

able to find, invoked Rule 11 or Rule 9011. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But did you -- the net 

effect of this is if you have taken a debt that is 

non-dischargeable and put it into the category that it 

is dischargeable unless the creditor objects. 

MR. MEEHAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the code puts the 

onus on the debtor to raise the hardship question. 

Your reading is, even if the debtor is 

silent, totally silent, says nothing about hardship, 

unless the creditor objects, then the discharge will be 

proper; the plan can be confirmed. So you are taking a 

burden that Congress has put on the debtor and switching 

it to the creditor. 

MR. MEEHAN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I would 

say that it doesn't shift the burden. It -- it does 

shift the going forward, I suppose, in the sense of

making an objection. 

But let's remember that this is something 

that would obviously have been reversed on appeal had 

the --

JUSTICE BREYER: But why would it not be a 

sanctionable matter under Rule 11? If -- the lawyer 

knows that he is supposed to make this special claim to 

get this kind of discharge -- he knows an ordinary claim 

won't do it. He submits a paper that asks for the 

ordinary discharge, but he has to sign it, and that 

sign -- that signature, is a -- is a certification that to 

the best of his knowledge, the claims and other legal 

contentions are warranted by existing law. 

So if he signs it knowing that that isn't 

the way to do it -- indeed, there is not even an 

argument for doing it that way, for modifying the law --

then why isn't that a sanctionable matter under Rule 11? 

MR. MEEHAN: I am not here to say absolutely 

it is not, Justice Breyer. 

What I'm saying, I think, is that some of 

the bankruptcy courts in some of the circuits have said, 

at least without invoking Rule 11, that it -- that it is 

improper. Others have not had that difficulty. I, as a 

lawyer who has litigated for 39 years and is very 

conscious of Rule 11, have never thought that if --

again, if it was something that was plain and not 

obfuscated, that a proposal to simply omit one element 

of a claim violated Rule 11. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, the reason I ask that 

MR. MEEHAN: I think it's debatable --

JUSTICE BREYER: The reason I ask that is I 

think the argument on the other side is that it's so 

clear in the law that this is not the way to go about it, 

that you have to make a separate piece of paper saying 

you have special hardship; that that’s so clear what 

Congress wanted, that 40 years later you can come back 

and attack it, if they didn't do it. I mean, that's 

basically, in my mind, their argument. 

But I think a simpler way would be to say if 

it's that clear, if it really is that clear, the bar 

itself will enforce the rule by not knowingly deviating 

from the way that Congress set it out, to which there is 

no legal objection. Now, is it really -- what do you 

think of that? 

MR. MEEHAN: I think that -- I think that, 

again, in the context of what this case -- the issue of 

this case, I think that's right.

Justice Kennedy, that they could fit within 60(a), (b),

MR. MEEHAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me just ask this and 

maybe I have bankruptcy law wrong. My -- my 

understanding is that if creditors are not listed, they 

are not discharged, correct? I think that's right in 

most cases. If you don't list the creditor, the 

creditor is not discharged. 

MR. MEEHAN: Um --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- if you're having 

problems with this --

MR. MEEHAN: I hesitate because rule 13 --

excuse me, section 1327 says the plan is binding upon 

creditors whether or not they are listed. But generally 

speaking that is correct. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I’m just wondering, 

doesn't it happen all the time that creditors are not 

listed and then they come in later and say the debt is 

not discharged? I mean, doesn't that happen all the time? 

MR. MEEHAN: I think that does happen 

frequently. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And is -- is the rationale 

that that -- that that discharge would be void as to 

them, or that they are just not covered?

that creditor never received notice. Is it void?

proceed without the adversary proceeding, I submit is

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it’s in a category 

that’s labeled “non-dischargeable.” There were other 

items in that -- that category, so let's take it that --

the child support arrears --

MR. MEEHAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The debtor says, look, I'll 

pay half of what I owe, and the spouse says, I need 

something for the children, I'll take it. And then the 

plan is confirmed, with only half of the child support; 

and then the caretaker spouse has a second thought and 

says, 2 years later, I need that money, I'm going to go 

after the debtor for the rest. 

MR. MEEHAN: Justice Ginsburg, the child 

support or domestic support has a number of additional 

protections surrounding it. Number one, not only does 

the petitioner for chapter 13 have to notify the 

creditor of the domestic support obligation, but under 

section 1302, the trustee has to do so. And my --

is my hypothetical. It's right in there, and the -- the

Ginsburg, that the argument proves too much, and that is

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess I don't understand 

your position, because I thought you had said that this 

should not have been discharged and now -- now you’ve 

answered to Justice Ginsburg that so long as the -- as the 

creditor appears they can all be discharged. Now, which 

is it? 

MR. MEEHAN: Well, Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Even if the creditor 

appears, it shouldn't be discharged. I thought that

dischargeable.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is it? 

MR. MEEHAN: The position that I had tried to 

explain -- and, again, I think it balances your point 

with Justice Stevens's point about waiver -- is that: 

Should? Absolutely, unless there is an affirmative 

waiver. But let's remember that when we talk about 

"should," I think we’re talking about appellate issues. 

We’re talking about error on appeal. We’re talking 

about what ought to happen. And the reason I say that,

the point about the same effect occurring for taxes and 

breaches of fiduciary duty et cetera, et cetera, proves 

too much, is that if we are going to say that none of 

those is finally put to rest, even though there was 

notice, even though there was acceptance of benefits, as 

occurred here, even though there was a submission to the 

jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, as occurred here 

-- even though there was, you know, just bypassing the 

early, if I may say "early" Rule 60 remedies -- if we 

are going to say that none of those --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your answer to me was 

that if the creditor doesn't object, even to a 

non-dischargeable debt -- if the creditor doesn't 

object, it's discharged. That's what you answered, I 

thought. 

MR. MEEHAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it doesn't matter 

whether it's child support, taxes, or student loans, 

right? Anything in the category -- you’re saying the 

creditor must object; otherwise it's covered by the 

discharge. 

MR. MEEHAN: Well, my position, I think, 

first is, is that, as I think Justice Breyer said, 

this is a -- this is a clear waiver, and I think the 

Court could rule on that basis. But, number two, I think

if this is a judgment -- a final judgment, proper 

notice -- we do not have a due process concern, we do not 

have a notice issue -- and the creditor has had plenty 

of opportunity to -- to raise the error --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure there 

was proper notice. There was not a notice that there 

would be a contested hearing. Or that there would be an 

adversary hearing. 

MR. MEEHAN: Justice Kennedy, I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm -- I’m not sure that 

there was a proper notice. 

MR. MEEHAN: I think you must look at it 

this way: The notice that was given was for the 

confirmation of a plan. That is the notice then that is 

required under the bankruptcy rules, and it was noticed 

in accordance with the bankruptcy rules. 

Is it right to do it in a bankruptcy plan 

confirmation? If objected to, no, it's not. If not 

objected to, the plan says what the plan says, and the 

notice that must be given is notice of the plan. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course that's the 

problem in the case. Sometimes we decide cases that 

don't make a lot of difference and that once we decide 

the rule everybody will know what the rule is. But in 

this case, the Petitioners say that if we adopt the rule

that the Ninth Circuit adopted, it's going to be 

extremely burdensome and costly on -- on municipalities, 

on -- on those who give student loans, et cetera. And 

that -- and that you are just creating a tremendous 

burden on an already overburdened system. 

MR. MEEHAN: Well, the argument that was 

made by the Petitioner and its amici on that point, I 

think, as -- as was pointed out in one of our amicus 

briefs, overlooks the electronic notice, the 

instantaneous notice, the fact that under Federal 

regulations, which, by the way, do also require the 

guarantee and lenders to do these things and to exercise 

due diligence before they can get repaid --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's -- that’s what why 

it’s a -- this is actually -- the part that is a lack of 

understanding or a complete understanding on my part, is 

-- is how Rule 60(b) works, because -- because it does ­

- the law does have the three categories -- the three 

categories that your friend described. And this third 

category is supposed to prevent a discharge even where 

the creditor doesn't object, unless certain things are 

filled out, and they weren't. 

So the three are there, made an objection. 

If at any point the creditor had come in and objected, 

not to the discharge but, you know, just said, hey, it's

JUSTICE BREYER: But -- but they waited a

60(b)(6) --

MR. MEEHAN: And it was only --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- and I take it there’s a 

time limit on that, and the time limit is “a reasonable 

time.” Is that how we are supposed to do, that we have 

to say they didn't file -- if fact they never filed 

60 -- it's your side that filed the 60(b)(4), I 

gather. So this is good and mixed up. 

MR. MEEHAN: They responded with a 60(b)(4). 

JUSTICE BREYER: It’s good and mixed up. So 

what is -- how is it supposed to work? 

MR. MEEHAN: Well, the crux of it is, is 

that there are other subparts of Rule 60, of course, 

as -- as we all know, that give broader potential relief, 

but they have time limits on them. 

And there is also the --

MR. MEEHAN: -- provision in section 1330 

that allows revocation for fraud, but also has a time 

limit upon it. But Rule 60(b)(4) does not have that 

time limit on it, but Rule 60(b)(4), which is the 

only basis upon which Petitioners sought relief in the 

bankruptcy court -- and they made that very clear in the 

district court -- the only basis would be if it is void, 

and that means one of two things: Number one is the due 

process issue, which we haven't spent a whole lot of 

time taking about, but I submit is clearly not viable 

because they had actual notice, and this Court has held, 

and so have --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not -- their 

position is that 528(a)(8) -- or 523(a)(8) makes this --

it puts it outside the discharge order. The discharge 

order does not cover this kind of debt. It doesn't 

discharge student -- student loans absent a hardship 

determination. 

So, what they are saying is the discharge 

discharged other things, but it could not discharge this 

particular debt, so it's not discharged. 

MR. MEEHAN: To be precise, if I may, 

1328(a) says, "The discharge shall not" and then defines 

the categories. And as Chief Justice Roberts said --

for just one moment, because I -- there is something 

niggling at me that I do need an answer to before you sit 

down --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I'd like him to 

answer the question that I asked him first. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. 

MR. MEEHAN: 1328 is the operative statute 

for the discharge of a chapter 13, and it says “shall 

discharge” except for those categories that are listed. 

The argument has been made that there is 

some significance to the 523, which says "does not 

discharge." But as -- as the Chief Justice observed, 

that applies only to the subpart (b)’s in 1328, which is 

discharges even if the plan has not been fully performed 

by the debtor. And the -- and this is not that 

circumstance. 

So the "does not" language is simply not 

applicable to our case, because it is not a 1328(b) 

discharge that we are involved with. 

And so, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I think your 

question, again, comes back to an argument of law, of 

procedure that would be dealt with on any appeal or 

perhaps on the -- on the more expansive subparts of Rule 

60 if they had been properly brought. But I do not 

see -- I have always had a hard time grappling with the

argument that somehow the fact that a statutory 

requirement was not followed falls into the category of 

acting so plainly beyond the court's jurisdiction that 

its action was a manifest abuse of discretion, and I 

think that's what you would have to conclude –-

JUSTICE KENNEDY: On the practicality point, 

you talk about electronic notice. I suppose that 

that -- that the creditors for student loans could have 

the automatic electronic thing where they say, we insist 

on a hardship hearing. But that doesn't solve the 

problem, because they’d then have to go back and see 

whether or not there was a hardship hearing in the case. 

So that -- that means they have -- they 

have -- they have to -- they have to inquire into every 

case whether or not the proper hearing has been made. 

MR. MEEHAN: Well, Justice Kennedy, they 

have to inquire, in any event, because the Federal 

regulations require them to, number one, determine that 

there was a filing; and, number two, even before there is 

an adversary proceeding, to make its own assessment, the 

lender or the guarantee -- the guarantor to make its own 

assessment whether it’s likely that there would be an 

undue hardship in the given case, and there are other 

circumstances which are set forth in the -- in an amicus 

brief --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, you mean they can't ask 

for a hearing unless there is a reasonable ground to 

believe that there is no undue hardship -- can’t even ask? 

MR. MEEHAN: No, I don't mean to say that. 

What I mean to say is that -- is that I submit that the 

hardship argument is a little bit overblown because they 

have the obligations -- even though they say they don't 

have even an obligation to open the envelope, they 

have an obligation to look at the petition, to see what 

the situation is, to see whether there’s likely an 

undue hardship. 

They don't have to forbear from making an 

objection to a plan unless they have a basis to 

determine that there was undue hardship. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, if they had 

come to the court at the time the discharge order was 

about to be entered and said we object, there has been 

no undue hardship found, would the court have been 

obligated to alter the plan at that point? The 

confirmed plan proposed a discharge, but at the time 

that the discharge order was being entered, there’s an 

objection. 

MR. MEEHAN: Justice --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would have 

happened?

MR. MEEHAN: Justice Sotomayor, I think that 

the result would not change, because at that point we 

have a long final plan, and we do have -- you know, the 

issue that is real important that we don't spend a lot 

of time talking about because it’s sort of ingrained in us 

is finality. There are chapter 13 --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that's the question. 

What's final? Is it the plan that’s final or is it the 

discharge order that’s final? 

MR. MEEHAN: It's the plan, I submit, 

because the plan is what determines what’s going to 

happen. The discharge is like giving the release after 

the plan has been fully --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but -- but here we 

have a discharge order that on its face appeared to be 

proper. It excepted out the student loan from the 

discharge. 

MR. MEEHAN: The original --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And your other -- the 

other side has sort of given up on that as a --

MR. MEEHAN: They have. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- as a point, because 

that, interestingly enough to me, would have been the 

stronger due process argument, whether the Ninth Circuit 

and the district court could have amended that discharge

order illegally to except something it didn't except, 

that was -- shouldn't have been excepted to start with. 

But that argument seems to have been put aside. 

MR. MEEHAN: It definitely was put aside. 

It was not raised. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- so, it might have 

been the stronger due process argument. But having put 

that aside, then your belief is that there is no point 

in time between the confirmation in the plan and the 

discharge order in which a party can object for -- to an 

error --

MR. MEEHAN: Well, of course --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- except as permitted by 

60(b) and 1330? 

MR. MEEHAN: Well -- and as permitted by just 

simply appealing the order. They could have done that. 

They could have appealed. They could have done 60 --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which order could they 

have -- they could not have appealed --

MR. MEEHAN: The confirmation -- the 

confirmation -- the -- the order confirming the plan. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They could not have 

appealed the discharge order? 

MR. MEEHAN: I can't answer that one. I 

don't know that they could have appealed it.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, going back to 

Justice Kennedy's point, I mean, some people are listed 

in discharge orders that were never discussed in the 

plan, or otherwise some people are excluded that should 

have been included. Those people can't appeal? 

MR. MEEHAN: Well, I am not prepared to say 

that they cannot. I certainly, if I were representing 

them, would try -- try it, but it's just something that 

I have not seen, and in working up this case, I am not 

familiar with it, but it may very well be an appealable 

order. 

My point is simply that, the bottom line, we 

have something here that is very final; there are 

literally billions of dollars of disbursements made by 

chapter 13 trustees in reliance on the these plans; and 

it would be very, very upsetting to the bankruptcy 

jurisdiction, exceedingly upsetting, to make a very broad 

exception to finality. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Ms. Wanslee, you have 3 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MADELEINE C. WANSLEE 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. WANSLEE: Briefly, just on this last 

point, no upset whatsoever to bring this matter back 

before the bankruptcy court. Mr. Espinosa is still free

to come back to bankruptcy court and argue that he has 

got an undue hardship. 

The distributions that are made through a 

chapter 13 plan are a matter of statutory right, every 

single adversary -- every single plan that had this 

illegal plan language could come back and it would not 

upset anything, nothing would change, no distribution 

whatsoever. I think that's an important point. 

And to be clear, the chief judge's -- Chief 

Justice's question, 523 by its terms brings in 1328(b), 

which is a different kind of discharge. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

MS. WANSLEE: But 1328(a)(2) specifically 

then incorporates 523. It is applicable. It is in play. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I -- my -- I'm 

not -- I'm not sure it does. It refers back to 523(a) 

to define the debt. I don't think it incorporates 

all -- all of 523. It's simply referring to the kind of 

debt that should not be discharged. 

MS. WANSLEE: Certainly, 1328(a)(2) provides 

the laundry list of exceptions to discharge. And that's 

the point, is that student loans are within that 19 

categories of debts that Congress said are excepted from 

discharge. 

In this case, there was really no basis to

appeal the discharge order. It was proper. It was 

appropriate. It excepted the student debt, and that’s 

found at page 46 of the record, Your Honor. 

In terms of what happened when the matter was 

on its limited remand, it was a very limited remand, 

and this issue was already teed up with the Ninth Circuit. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you go back to the 

fundamental part of my question to your adversary? The 

plan order included a discharge of the student 

interest -- of the interest on the student loan. 

MS. WANSLEE: It did not so specifically 

state, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It just proposed a 

discharge of a certain amount lesser than the principal 

plus interest. 

MS. WANSLEE: It had a predicate of 

discharge of interest, no predicate of undue hardship. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right. That's the plan. 

And then you have a discharge order. And the two are 

not congruent. So what's the final judgment? 

MS. WANSLEE: The final judgment, Your 

Honor, is the effect of 1328. Think of bankruptcy as --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. Is it the 

confirmation order or is it the discharge order? Are they 

different judgments? What -- what controls? And what

were you --

MS. WANSLEE: The controlling order here is 

the discharge order. And the reason why is because 

bankruptcy is a continuum of events all leading to the 

discharge. The discharge is the goal. That's what the 

debtor wants. But only Congress can tell a debtor what 

he gets to discharge. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what does the notice 

of -- the time for a notice of appeal run from? 

MS. WANSLEE: Pardon me? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What does the time for the 

notice of appeal run from -- the discharge order? 

MS. WANSLEE: Well, for the plan itself, 

from the plan entry. Now, once again, we never got a 

copy of the plan entry. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now -- now, just in the --

in the general run of the bankruptcy, how do you calculate 

when you have to file your appeal -- from the time of 

the discharge order? 

MS. WANSLEE: Well, if we were going to 

appeal from -- from the plan, it would be the plan or --

but there’s no reason to appeal from the plan, because 

once again, 1328 excepts our debt specifically from 

discharge through the plan.
