 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

 Ms. Harrison.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LINDSAY C. HARRISON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. HARRISON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 In 1996 Congress provided in 8 U.S.C. 

1252(b)(3)(B) that courts may stay an alien's order of 

removal pending appeal. The question in this case is 

whether Congress intended that temporary stays of 

removal be governed by the normal standards applicable 

to States or instead by the special standard that 

Congress separately set forth for injunctions in 

1252(f)(2). There are three primary reasons why the 

normal stay standard should apply.

 First, Congress used different words to 

describe these different forms of relief, "stay" in 

(b)(3)(B) and "enjoin" in (f)(2). Congress used 

different words because it saw these forms of relief as 

different.

 Second and related, a stay is in fact 

different from an injunction. It is a temporary vacatur

of a court or vacancy order pending review. It is not 

directed at a party and does not order a party to take 

action.

 Third, even an alien with a strong 

likelihood of success on the merits who will face 

certain persecution if deported cannot get a stay under 

the (f)(2) standard, a result Congress should not be 

presumed to authorize in the absence of a clear 

statement to that effect.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I'm not 

sure this matters very much, But do you know if -- are 

stays usually granted in this type of case? Not this 

type of case: A removal case as opposed to an 

application to reopen.

 MS. HARRISON: In a removal case stays are 

granted in eight circuits only if the individual meets 

the traditional --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, I understand 

it. I am just saying if you happen to know empirically 

if most people who are facing removal get a stay.

 MS. HARRISON: I have seen no empirical --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the government -- I 

thought the government said that an empirical database 

would be the Ninth Circuit, which has the more generous

rule.

 MS. HARRISON: That's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: My understanding is that 

stays are granted in a very high percentage of those 

cases. I would be curious to know, A, the percentage of 

the cases in which it's granted; and B, the percentage 

of those cases that are ultimately decided in favor of 

the government?

 MS. HARRISON: The data that I believe Your 

Honor is referencing was the rate at which petitions for 

review are filed, and not the rate at which stays are 

granted or filed.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is it true that 

there are more petitions filed in the courts with the 

more generous standards?

 MS. HARRISON: Again, I have not seen a 

comprehensive study. There are more petitions filed in 

the Ninth Circuit, but there is no evidence of the cause 

of that. And -- and I think it's important that stays 

are in fact denied under the traditional standard, 

because what that demonstrates is that the traditional 

standard effectuates Congress's purpose of passing 

IIRIRA and eliminating the automatic stay and making it 

in fact more difficult for an individual to obtain a 

stay on appeal. That -- the traditional standard does

have real teeth and it does not result in an automatic 

stay.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many years ago was 

the automatic stay eliminated? When did this -- the 

current law come into effect?

 MS. HARRISON: At the same time in 1996. 

Congress both eliminated the automatic stay, and it 

replaced it with the language in 1252(b)(3)(B), which 

indicates that a stay is not automatic unless a court 

orders otherwise. And -- now, that language was nearly 

identical to the language that had previously existed, 

where a stay was automatic except for aggravated felons. 

For aggravated felons, the statute provided that a stay 

was not automatic unless a court otherwise directs. And 

courts had interpreted that language to provide for 

application of the traditional stay standards.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it possible in 

this case to kind of split the baby? You have a more 

appealing fact case than is typical, because yours 

involves a denial of a motion to reopen and doesn't 

really go to the ultimate merits. Most of the petitions 

I think do go to the ultimate merits, and it's easier to 

see that (f)(2) may apply there as opposed to your case.

 Now, is there a coherent way of saying that? 

In other words, in your type of case, you apply the

traditional stay standards, but in a case where the 

issue that is before the court is whether to order 

removal or not on the merits, the other approach 

applies.

 MS. HARRISON: I think that the way to do 

that, Your Honor, is to apply (f)(2) where the alien is 

seeking permanent relief. And where the alien is 

seeking to enjoin his or her removal, the (f)(2) 

standard makes a lot of sense, but the (f)(2) standard 

doesn't contain any predictive language. It doesn't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's 

just really saying the way that you avoid that is to say 

you win across the board. I mean, it -- my 

understanding is that in situations in which they are 

going to be seeking an injunction to enjoin are quite 

limited. They are typically just seeking to vacate the 

legal order.

 MS. HARRISON: And if you then apply the 

(f)(2) standard across the board to stay requests, then 

what that would mean is that the court of appeals is 

deciding the merits twice: It's deciding it at the 

outset when determining whether or not the individual is 

entitled to a stay; and then it's deciding it again when 

the court decides whether the individual's entitled to 

have the order of removal vacated. And that just

doesn't seem like what Congress had in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I think I 

understand that point when they're seeking to have the 

order -- the removal order vacated. But here you are 

seeking the reopening of the proceedings, which I guess 

is a little different, isn't it, than the underlying 

decision on the merits?

 MS. HARRISON: Technically, the order of 

removal is the order denying the motion to reopen, so 

they are one and the same, in this case and in any case 

where the petition for review is of an order of removal, 

which is what the statute provides for. And I think 

that point is very important --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that right? How 

can that be? I mean, you have an order of removal, and 

then you move to reopen the proceedings. Aren't they 

two separate things?

 MS. HARRISON: Well, the statute provides 

that an order denying a motion to reopen is itself an 

order of removal, and that it's consolidated with the 

original order of removal on appeal. So that they 

become one and the same case, and the order denying the 

motion to reopen is the order of removal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where does it say 

that?

MS. HARRISON: I do not believe that it is 

in 1252 itself, and I don't have the citation for you. 

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

 MS. HARRISON: Back to the point that it's 

important to recognize that the (f)(2) standard contains 

no predictive language, it doesn't allow a court to say, 

is this individual likely to succeed on the merits? It 

says can this individual show, by clear and convincing 

evidence, that the entry or execution of the removal 

order is prohibited by law, not likely to show, not we 

are likely to find.

 And so if courts were required to apply this 

standard at the stay stage, they would be deciding the 

very same question twice. They would be deciding both 

the merits question of whether the individual removal 

order is prohibited by law and also the stay question of 

whether it should be stayed pending --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That wouldn't be deciding 

it the same way twice. Initially, they would just have 

to decide whether -- whether the alien has shown by 

clear and convincing evidence that he should win, and if 

they decide no, he hasn't, then at the merits stage they 

have to decide which one prevails by a preponderance of 

the evidence. So it's really a different call the

second time.

 MS. HARRISON: Well, Your Honor, the 

government has stated in its brief that it believes 

these two standards to be virtually identical. And in 

the event that a stay was granted, it would certainly 

render the merits decision superfluous because, if a 

stay was granted and you could meet this higher burden, 

then perforce you could meet the lower burden.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true.

 MS. HARRISON: And so, in that situation, 

(b)(3)(B) would be superfluous.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you claim that 

(f)(2) covers, if it doesn't cover these stays?

 MS. HARRISON: It covers any time an alien 

seeks an injunction, now, both in the courts of appeals 

and in a district court case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How can that be?

 MS. HARRISON: Well, the Catholic Social 

Services case is one example where individuals were 

challenging the procedures whereby their legalization 

applications were adjudicated under the Immigration 

Reform and Control Act. And in that case, they sought 

injunctive relief as a class to enjoin their removal 

pending that case and permanently, in fact, because they 

said they were entitled to legalization, which was an

amnesty statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's --

that's kind of a systemic challenge, but you wouldn't 

have a situation where you get an injunction in far more 

typical individual cases, right?

 MS. HARRISON: Well, if an individual in 

that case, Your Honor, attempted to enjoin his or her 

removal, then the (f)(2) standard would certainly apply 

to that individual. And there's -- there's a reason why 

an individual couldn't have brought that challenge as 

opposed to a class.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why would he seek to enjoin 

his removal when he is subject to a much lesser standard 

when he just seeks to stay the removal? I mean, does he 

have a bad lawyer or what?

 MS. HARRISON: Well, in that case, it would 

be in a district court, which doesn't have supervisory 

authority over the court of appeals -- I'm sorry --

over the BIA's order. And so the district court 

presumably couldn't stay an order that it wasn't 

reviewing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't he go to the 

court of appeals, is the next question.

 MS. HARRISON: Well, he perhaps might, but 

if there was a delay in the procedure or if there was

some reason why --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a fluke. I mean, 

that is a flukey situation. And I find it hard to 

believe that (f)(2) was meant to address just that.

 MS. HARRISON: Well, it would be in any 

case, even in the court of appeals, where an individual 

sought an injunction as opposed to a stay. For example, 

if it was a situation like the Singh case in the Ninth 

Circuit, where there was a stay of removal in place, but 

the agency was deporting the individual anyway. Then 

the individual would need to obtain an injunction, and 

in fact that was essentially what the Ninth Circuit 

ordered, was a remand for the imposition of an 

injunction against --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Also a fluke. We don't 

expect the -- the executive to ignore a stay.

 MS. HARRISON: No, Your Honor. I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I think it's a fluke, too, 

but you gave -- to my recollection, I forget where it 

was -- I think you gave citations to three or four cases 

in which that actually happened.

 MS. HARRISON: The Singh case, Your Honor, 

is one of those cases. There's also the Lindstrom case 

from the Seventh Circuit. And it does happen that, 

either because of a miscommunication or some other

reason, that the stay is not effective, and in that case 

an injunction would be.

 And I think, in order to address the Court's 

concern that (f)(2) is a fluke, it's important to take a 

look at where it appears in the statute and its context. 

Now, originally, the statute contained only (f)(1), 

which says that you cannot obtain injunctions as a 

class, but that individuals can obtain injunctions. 

There was no (f)(2).

 The bill went to conference and then 

Congress added in (f)(2), I think to make very clear 

that, although they had carved out this exception in 

(f)(1) for individual cases, that it was not to be 

granted as a matter of course, that even in particular 

cases, which is the subtitle of (f)(2), the standard 

should be very strict. And so I think Congress saw 

itself as closing a potential hole here, because it had 

created this opportunity to obtain an injunction as an 

individual without articulating a standard. Then 

Congress went about articulating standard in (f)(2). 

And it's a very high standard.

 Now, Congress did not cross-reference 

(b)(3)(B), which is the stay provision, and in fact, in 

the transitional rules, what Congress did was it only --

it only included a provision that was identical to

(b)(3)(B). It did not include (f)(2) in the 

transitional rules, which -- all of which demonstrate 

that Congress did not see (f)(2) and (b)(3)(B) as 

related; they saw them as separate with (f)(2) governing 

injunctions and (b)(3)(B) governing stays.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe I'm missing 

something but -- and, again, I don't know which way this 

cuts, but the dispute strikes me as very academic as a 

practical matter: Judges looking at whether someone is 

likely to prevail on the merits versus judges looking at 

whether the person has shown by clear and convincing 

evidence that he shouldn't be removed. The judge that's 

going to find one in one case, depending on the 

standard, and the opposite in the same case I can't 

visualize.

 MS. HARRISON: Well, the key I believe, Your 

Honor, is the equities. Now, the (f)(2) standard does 

not permit consideration of the equities in determining 

whether removal is prohibited by law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't? You're 

talking about equities or irreparable harm?

 MS. HARRISON: Both, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Both standards?

 MS. HARRISON: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Same thing. And you

cannot consider that at all under (f)(2)? There's no 

way in which the removal would be prohibited as a matter 

of law under provisions that are concerned, for example, 

about whether the person would be tortured or something 

like that?

 MS. HARRISON: Well -- well, Your Honor, 

under the (f)(2) standard, take, for example, someone 

who had applied for asylum, and it was denied on a 

procedural technicality, and the question is: Was the 

entry of the execution -- entry or execution of the 

removal order prohibited by law?

 That -- the issue of whether the 

technicality was a -- was a correct finding or was not a 

correct finding permits no consideration of whether or 

not that individual, if they are deported, is going to 

face persecution, torture, death, et cetera. Only under 

the -- the traditional --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because the 

objection is on this procedural matter?

 MS. HARRISON: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if the objection 

is that I am going to be tortured so you shouldn't order 

my removal, he would be able to -- the court under 

(f)(2) would be able to consider that, wouldn't it?

 MS. HARRISON: I don't believe so, Your

Honor, unless the very question that was being decided 

is whether the individual had met the -- met the 

standard for relief under the Convention Against 

Torture. But there are also cases where an individual 

is seeking asylum, and there are questions about whether 

-- whether the persecution is on the basis of a 

protected class.

 Now, the question there is not whether or 

not the person is likely to suffer irreparable harm if 

they go back, but, rather, what is the basis on which 

they may be entitled to asylum? And so the Court in 

Bohegan --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't they get to 

pursue that even after they are sent back? There are 

provisions that -- that their case does not abate just 

because they have been removed?

 MS. HARRISON: That is true, Your Honor. 

However, their case may abate because they are killed, 

they are put in jail, they are not in a position to come 

back to this country. And that is why consideration of 

the equities in this context is so critical and why 

Congress would not have eliminated the equities from the 

consideration without a very clear statement-

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess that's 

why -- I guess that goes back to my earlier question,

which is, I see that if they are killed the case is 

probably not in very good shape. But -- but the 

situations in which they are likely to face that sort of 

difficulties upon removal it would seem to me are 

situations where the removal would be prohibited by law.

 MS. HARRISON: Well, Your Honor, that was --

the court of appeals would only be allowed to consider 

that if the question presented was whether they had 

proven that they were likely to be killed if they were 

returned to the country. But that often is not what --

the question that the court of appeals is deciding.

 It is deciding a procedural question. It is 

deciding whether the persecution was on the basis of a 

protected class, those sorts of considerations, which 

are not the same question as: Is this person likely to 

be killed if they are returned?

 That's why -- that's why the -- this Court 

has held that unless Congress demonstrates very clearly 

that it intends to take away the court's ability to 

consider the equities, that we don't interpret 

Congress's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Excuse me, but I'm not 

following. I have the same difficulty that perhaps the 

Chief Justice is trying to get at. In the case where it 

appears to the -- the judge that the -- that the alien

would be murdered when he is returned, wouldn't his 

deportation be prohibited by law?

 MS. HARRISON: Well, not always, Your Honor, 

if the question that the court was considering wasn't 

whether in fact the individual was going to be killed if 

returned. If the question the court is considering is 

whether -- whether a crime he has committed subjects the 

individual to deportation, then the fact that that 

individual is going to be killed when he is returned to 

the country is not part of the (f)(2) calculus.

 And -- and I don't believe that the 

government has -- has argued that the equities would be 

part of the consideration. The government has argued 

that for legal -- for factual questions you need to 

prove them by clear and convincing evidence, and for 

legal questions you need to prove you are entitled to a 

judgment as a matter of law.

 Where the equities fall into that calculus 

is -- is unclear, and I think they would only fall under 

that calculus if the very question presented to the 

court was that one. And -- and then, moreover, when you 

say --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say "equities," 

is the fact that he has applied or his wife has applied 

for adjustment of his status, is that an equity?

MS. HARRISON: No, Your Honor, I don't 

believe that that itself would be an equity. But the 

fact that he does have a wife and he does have a young 

child in this country would be a permissible 

consideration in the equitable analysis, in the analysis 

of -- of irreparable harm that would come to him and his 

family. The -- the basis for his motion to reopen was 

not the denial of adjustment -- of his adjustment of 

status.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was changing 

conditions.

 MS. HARRISON: That's right, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Alleged changing 

conditions.

 MS. HARRISON: Yes, Your Honor.

 And I also think that -- that it's important 

to emphasize this Court's clear-statement rule, which is 

that the court doesn't take for -- lightly statutes that 

do not very, very clearly take away the power of the 

courts to grant the stay, to grant an injunction. And 

if it's not very clear from the face of the statute that 

that is what Congress intended, that the court will not 

interpret as having done so.

 I also think that it's important to 

emphasize that when Congress wanted to be expansive in

getting rid of forms of equitable relief, it was. In 

1252(e)(1)(A), for example, which if you would like to 

look appears on page 11a of the appendix to the gray 

brief, that's the provision where Congress limited the 

forms of equitable relief available to aliens facing 

removal in expedited situations. And there Congress's 

language was very clear that: No declaratory injunctive 

or other equitable relief. There is no language of that 

sort in (f)(2); the same with (f)(1).

 In that provision Congress said no court in 

-- in a class situation can enjoin or restrain the 

removal of an alien. Not in (f)(2). In (f)(2) Congress 

only used the word "enjoin" in its omission of other 

equitable relief, and its omission of restrain are 

instructive.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think 

references to equitable relief and restrain are clear 

enough to cover the Court's authority to grant a stay?

 MS. HARRISON: I don't believe that restrain 

is, Your Honor, because I think restrain -- it's unclear 

whether Congress is talking about a stay versus a 

temporary injunction or a restraining order. I think 

other equitable relief does capture stays, because we 

don't deny that a stay is a form of equitable relief. 

It's simply not an injunction, because it's not directed

at a party, and it doesn't order a party to do 

something.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just to refresh my 

recollection, what -- what is the major difference 

between the standards that -- or the findings that the 

judge must make, (a) to grant a preliminary injunction 

and (b) to grant a stay?

 MS. HARRISON: That has to be the same, Your 

Honor, in the usual situation, because both arise at the 

same stage in the proceedings where it makes sense that 

the court would want to consider: What is the 

likelihood that this person is going to succeed down the 

road? What -- what is the risk if I don't grant relief 

at this stage?

 But those two things are also treated 

differently in the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 

in Rule 8 and also Rule 18, which governs only stays of 

agency orders and not injunctions.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: My -- my concern is that I 

sense in this statute a congressional concern that stays 

are too frequently granted. And one thing we could do, 

if we were to accept your view of the statute, is to 

say: And you must be very careful.

 Well, the courts don't listen to that very 

much. And short of granting the -- accepting the

government's position, I don't know what you could do if 

there were a -- a submission and understanding that 

stays were being granted routinely and too frequently.

 MS. HARRISON: Well, Your Honor, the -- the 

standard that Congress intended, the traditional one, is 

not a standard under which stays are -- are routinely 

granted. They -- they have been denied in some of the 

very cases where the circuits decided whether (f)(2) 

applies or -- or whether the traditional standard 

applies.

 And this Court has given guidance, for 

example, this term in Winter, that you have to -- not to 

show some likelihood of -- of suffering or irreparable 

harm, but you have to show a strong probability of 

success on the merits, and you have to show a strong 

probability of irreparable harm. And so if down the 

road it seems that courts are not faithfully 

implementing that standard, then the Court could again 

provide guidance to that effect. But I don't think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That case -- this case 

could come out the same. If we remand and we say that 

it's the traditional standards, this case might well 

come out the same way. The -- the court might say, 

well, it doesn't make it under the traditional -- it 

hasn't shown a likelihood of success on the merits.

MS. HARRISON: That's right, Your Honor. 

And -- and it very well could, and we feel we are 

entitled, obviously, to make that showing before the 

Fourth Circuit and have the Fourth Circuit apply the 

traditional test and make a decision under that test in 

the first instance. But it is true that the State could 

be denied, and that there is no guarantee. It is not 

automatic.

 And that's why I think before '96 Congress 

used the same language for aggravated felons then that 

it does now for everyone. Because it knew that "unless 

a court otherwise directs" doesn't mean automatic. It 

means that only where there -- there is a likelihood of 

success and where the equities counsel in -- in favor of 

the stay, it should be granted.

 That's also how this Court interpreted that 

similar language in Hilton in interpreting Federal Rule 

of Appellate Procedure 239(c), which concerns a stay of 

a grant of a writ of habeas corpus on appeal. This 

Court said that the traditional stay standard should 

apply in that situation interpreting virtually the same 

language that Congress then chose to use in this 

provision, (e)(3)(B).

 I would like to reserve the remainder of my 

time.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 General Kneedler.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The statutory text, context and background 

of section 1252(f)(2) all demonstrate that that section 

applies to orders granting a stay of removal pending a 

court of appeals decision on a petition for review. 

Indeed, if section 1252(f)(2) does not apply to such an 

order barring removal, it is difficult to see what 

function it would serve.

 Now, Petitioner's counsel has suggested that 

1252(f)(2) must be directed to what I think had been 

referred to as fluke kind of district court orders, and 

couldn't really be directed at the situation that we 

have here. There are two very powerful responses to 

that, if I may make them both.

 The first is that subsection (f)(2), which 

appear on page 14a of our brief refers, it says no court 

shall enjoin the removal, et cetera, under this section, 

meaning that the provision is specifically directed to 

court orders that are entered as part of the proceedings 

on judicial review of final orders under section 1252.

It's not -- it's not principally directed at collateral 

orders that might arise in some other class action or 

some other sort of suit.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Were the examples that she 

gives, the two or three cases, properly examples under 

this section, in your --

GEN. KNEEDLER: Well, I think there were two 

different types of examples that she gave, if I may. I 

think the first one was a situation where a Department 

of Homeland Security officer might have erroneously 

carried out an order of removal not realizing that there 

was a -- a stay entered.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I interrupt you just a 

second? When I meant examples, I meant the cited cases. 

There were two or three cited cases.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: The -- the cited cases, we 

don't think, are examples of this. (F)(2) was not at 

issue in those -- in those cases. The question in 

several of them was whether the separate provision 

1252(g), which this Court discussed in the American-Arab 

case, whether that applied, and there was at least one 

other case, it involved the transitional rules under 

which (f)(2) doesn't apply.

 But I think the more fundamental answer to 

your point was the second point that I was -- that I was

going to make. There are -- there are three provisions 

of section 1252 that make unmistakably clear that 

Congress did not intend any challenge to a final order 

of removal, any form of judicial review which would 

include an injunction to take place outside of 1252 

itself. And 1252(a)(1) provides the judicial review 

shall be pursuant to chapter 158 of -- and that's on 

page 1a of the brief -- shall be pursuant to chapter 158 

of title 28, the Hobbs Judicial Review Act.

 And then (a)(5), which is on page 4a of our 

brief, says notwithstanding any other provision of law, 

a petition for review filed with an appropriate court is 

the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of the 

removal order. Unless there be any doubt, the last 

sentence the in that section says for purposes of this 

entire chapter. Any time there is a reference to 

judicial review, it refers to any sort of statutory or 

nonstatutory provision.

 So any time an alien would try to get an 

injunction in any form of judicial review, Congress has 

expressed barred it not only by this, but then also by 

subsection (b)(9).

 JUSTICE BREYER: On that particular point, 

just specifically -- this is awfully complicated and you 

have had to go through it pretty quickly, and so have I.

All right.

 So, it seems to me, looking at these three 

sections, as soon as you get to (a)(2), it says certain 

matter are not subject to judicial review, and it 

includes 1225(b)(1), which I take it is the case where 

somebody comes in, knocks at our door, and the 

immigration judge says good-bye and he says, no, no, I 

am entitled to be a refugee or asylum.

 Now, we look at that, it says in there it's 

subsection (e) gives you judicial review of that. Now we 

look at the thing you cited which is (5) -- (a)(5), and 

you read it completely correctly, but you left out these 

words "except as provided in subsection (e)."

 So now we go to subsection (e). And lo and 

behold, what is subsection (e) talking about, but just 

the case I have mentioned. It talks about -- it talks 

about judicial review for orders under 1225(b)(1). Now, 

those are the people who knock at the door and they want 

asylum. And there is some procedures for them.

 So, now we look at (e) to see what are the 

procedures for them. And lo and behold, right there in 

(2), it says you can have a habeas corpus procedure as 

to certain matters, whether he is an alien, whether he 

has been admitted as a refugee, et cetera. So it says 

there are some you can have habeas corpus.

So I imagine a person who has been ordered 

removed under (e). All right. Now it says you can have 

a habeas corpus and now the judge says good-bye. And 

they go to a reviewing court, which is going to be a 

habeas corpus court, and that court decides, the alien 

is right, I am going to issue an injunction.

 Now, just in case he's thinking that, in the 

very next section (f), what we have are two provisions, 

(f)(1) that says if his case is a case involving mass 

action against the whole thing, you can't enter an 

injunction.

 And then we look at (2), and it says if his 

is just a normal case, you can't enter an injunction 

unless it meets this specific standard. So I looked at 

that. And I admit this is pretty quick, and I thought 

it's (e) and it's (f), and (f) is dealing with (e), 

(f)(2). And it makes perfect sense. They don't want a 

habeas corpus judge telling that immigration judge what 

to do with the guy knocking on the door and saying "I 

need asylum," unless they meet clear and present 

danger -- clear and -- whatever it is, clear and 

present -- yeah.

 Okay. Now, I will admit I read that 

quickly. And therefore, I am probably missing something. 

And I don't expect you necessarily to be an expert, but

can you do your best to tell me what I am missing or if 

you think I might be right?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Yes, if I could. 1225(b)(1) 

governs the special -- what is called expedited removal. 

It's a special procedure, as you identified, for people 

essentially knocking at the door, and it has very 

limited review, as you suggested. Almost everything is 

unreviewable except possibility of asylum.

 But it's -- that is the only provision for 

district court review. It's the, shall we say, 

functional equivalent of a petition for review in the 

court of appeals and everybody else. Congress just 

decided to have two different -- two separate 

procedures, and I think for 1225(b)(1) it's really a 

carryover orders of exclusion prior to 1996.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What it says here 

specifically is it says habeas proceedings.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Yes, it does -- it does 

say -- it does say habeas, but (f) -- there is no 

suggestion that (f), either (1), which is general 

application, or (f)(2) in particular is limited to 

subsection (e). It -- it speaks of any injunction.

 And that is instructive because the term 

"injunction" is used in the Hobbs Judicial Review Act to 

describe an interlocutory order by a court of appeals on

judicial review that suspends the enforcement of an 

agency order pending judicial review. And we quote the 

Hobbs Judicial Review Act in our brief.

 And as I mentioned before, that is very 

important to understand here, because Congress 

provided -- other than the habeas review for this 

special category, Justice Breyer, Congress provided that 

judicial review in the norm is in the court of appeals 

pursuant to the Hobbs Act. And if you look at the Hobbs 

Act provision for interlocutory stays, it refers to 

interlocutory relief as an injunction. It uses the 

word --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, let me add one other 

thing, because all I am trying to do is find some work 

for this section (f)(2) to do. And I think I found 

some. And I think what you say is wait a minute, we 

agree it's like habeas. But and I think it would be 

like an exclusion order rather than a removal order.

 And I did notice previously when it talks 

about 1225, sometimes it uses the word "exclusion" and 

sometimes it says "removal." But if you were that 

district habeas judge and you get a thing saying 

removal, you don't really vacate it. I think what you 

had do is order an injunction against its enforcement. 

Here I don't know --

GEN. KNEEDLER: I think the habeas court 

would have the authority -- would have the authority to 

vacate just as -- just as a court of appeals would have 

the authority to vacate.

 But my basic point is that both of them are 

forms of judicial review. And if this heightened 

injunction standard applies to the form of judicial 

review that Congress has decided to leave in habeas, 

then there is no reason to imagine why Congress wouldn't 

want the same injunctive standard to apply to somebody 

who is seeking judicial review in the normal way, in the 

court of appeals, especially since Congress used the 

word "injunction" to describe this very sort of 

interlocutory relief under the Hobbs Judicial Review Act 

when -- when a person seeks judicial review in a -- in a 

court of appeals.

 And this conforms to the ordinary meaning of 

the word which is "enjoin," which is to prohibited 

something, to require a party to abstain from carrying 

out an act. That's exactly what a stay of removal does.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- do you 

agree with your friend that the basic difference between 

your two positions is that under the stay factors you 

are allowed to consider irreparable harm but are not 

allowed to consider that under (f)(2).

GEN. KNEEDLER: No, I think (f)(2) -- (f)(2) 

is -- is a necessary condition for granting relief. It 

doesn't -- it doesn't eliminate the requirement that an 

alien show -- show harm from the -- from the removal. 

It's -- it's a condition --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What difference would it 

make? I mean, if he can satisfy the clear and 

convincing standard, which is tantamount to saying that 

on final judgment I win, hands down, what need is there 

to -- to go into irreparable harm?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: And that -- and that -- that 

-- that may well be. I think it may well be in the 

typical case. If I -- if I could just --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but -- but that's --

no, but in any case, if he's got to show by clear and 

convincing evidence that he is going to have success on 

the merits, I don't see any point in any case of going 

into irreparable harm. If he goes into irreparable harm 

without the clear and convincing standard, he loses. If 

he satisfies the clear and convincing standard, there is 

nothing for irreparable harm considerations to -- to add 

to -- to the mix of factors.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well, as we understand the 

reference to clear and convincing evidence, and 

admittedly it's not entirely clear how Congress intended

that standard to apply in this context. As we 

understand it it is -- it is a standard of review 

slightly more favorable to the alien than the 

substantial evidence review standard, which is what 

would apply -- one final --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It's certainly more than a 

preponderance?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Yes. But -- but in no 

event, even on review of the final order, is the court 

reviewing for a preponderance of the evidence; the court 

is reviewing the case on the administrative record under 

the substantial evidence test, in which case the court 

at final judgment cannot set aside the -- the agency 

order, except -- unless it finds that no reasonable 

factfinder could conclude that the order should stand. 

That's the substantial evidence test.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the ultimate -- the 

ultimate standard to which they look is a preponderance 

standard. In other words, the substantial evidence 

standard is keyed to what a reasonable factfinder could 

find reasonably, based upon substantial evidence. Is 

the substantial evidence sufficient for such a 

factfinder to find by a preponderance that this person 

has failed to meet, or, put it the other way around, 

that the factfinder has unreasonably failed to find that

the Petitioner has met the standard?

 So ultimately you are talking about a 

preponderance standard, which is -- which is the key, 

isn't that correct?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: That -- that is -- the court 

-- you are correct in the sense that the court is 

reviewing to see whether substantial evidence supports 

the IJ's determination by a preponderance of the 

evidence. But (f)(2) is written in terms of the sort of 

showing that the alien must make to the court, and --

and not -- not what he would have made to the IJ. And 

as -- and as we read it, as we try to apply the language 

in the context of a stay, we thing that means that the 

alien must show something a little bit short of -- of 

the substantial evidence, that no reasonable factfinder 

could find it, at least clear and convincing evidence 

that as -- that the IJ was incorrect or that the alien 

has a successful case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there other cases in 

which clear and convincing -- the clear and convincing 

standard applies to appellate courts? It seems to me 

clear and convincing is more appropriate for a factual 

determination at the trial court level.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: It -- it -- it ordinarily 

is. And that --and that's why the phrasing, as I was

trying to discuss with Justice Souter, I think, is a 

little awkward. Another possible way to think about it, 

and this may be what Congress was really driving at, 

when it was -- when it was saying clear and convincing 

evidence, it really meant a clear and convincing 

showing; that the -- that the courts shouldn't take this 

too casually.

 As we point out in our brief, the Second 

Circuit has a standard that the alien just has to show 

more than a negligible likelihood of success on the 

merits to prevail. Well, that -- that's way below what 

even the traditional standard would be. So it's 

possible to read clear and convincing evidence as really 

driving at clear and convincing showing, which is 

language that is -- that is somewhat reminiscent of what 

this Court has said for preliminary injunctions 

generally.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I take it at 

least in the Seventh Circuit these things are usually 

granted?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: They're -- uh -- we do not 

have empirical data, and I wish we did, on the 

percentage, but they are -- in the Ninth Circuit in our 

experience -- again we don't have percentages, but they 

are granted quite frequently.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the standard is 

probable success on the merits, and that's not an easy 

standard. Irreparable harm and probable success on the 

merits, both.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well, if -- if the courts 

actually applied that standard, there would at least be 

some improvement in the stay standards, but the courts 

sometimes apply a sliding scale, where they say if there 

is -- you know, a serious question and a showing -- a 

showing of substantial harm would be sufficient. Well, 

this Court has twice reaffirmed in the last term, in the 

last term --

JUSTICE BREYER: What are we supposed to do? 

What would you had do? Suppose you are a district court 

judge and at 2:00 in the afternoon on Friday a petition 

comes in and it's from someone who says, "I'm going to 

be on the 5:00 airplane to Hong Kong and I have a real 

case here. I think I am right." And he has eight pages 

attached and you read through that. And you say, "He 

has a point. Now how good this point is, I don't know. 

So I would like to put this -- I would like to have 

everybody in here on Monday, and then I could figure it 

out."

 Now, that probably happens. Now what is 

worrying me about your position on this -- which,

although most -- I think every circuit is against you on 

this, except for this one.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: And there are others.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And it seems to me that 

would make it impossible for the district judge to do, 

because the district judge cannot honestly say that it's 

clear and convincing that this man is going to win. All 

he knows is he has a point and he would like to hear 

more about it and he doesn't want him on the airplane 

three hours from now from Hong Kong. So I -- so how is 

it supposed to work?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well, it would be the court 

of appeals, not the district judge.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Right.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: But it -- we believe that 

that -- that 1252(f)(2) allows a court to take the time 

necessary to rule meaningfully on the stay application. 

We do not believe Congress intended to divest the court 

of the ability to rule on the merits. It has a 

substantive standard that the alien has to make a clear 

and convincing -- has to show by clear and convincing 

evidence. It presupposes that the alien has to make a 

showing; therefore it presupposes that the court must be 

able to evaluate that showing. We also believe that it 

presupposes that the government is permitted to respond

to it.

 So we -- we do not object and have not 

objected in the lower courts to the courts taking 

sufficient time to -- to freeze the status quo by 

issuing a short stay if necessary to do that.

 Now, in the Eleventh Circuit, for example, 

which has operated under this heightened showing for 

some period of time, it tends to work out, because when 

a -- a -- a petition for review and stay application is 

granted, the court contacts the Office of Immigration 

Litigation which works with DHS to inform the court on 

how soon the order might be issued, and then the court's 

aware of how quickly it might act.

 So -- so it wouldn't often be necessary for 

the court to do it, but we did not challenge that 

authority.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But and -- and I applaud 

the fact that you don't, but I don't know how you can do 

it consistently with your view that "stay" in (b)(3)(B) 

means the same thing as the "injunction" in (f) when 

"injunction" in (f) is restricted as much as it is.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well, I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: God bless you, but I don't 

know how -- I don't know how under the statute, on your 

reading of the statute, you -- you can do it.

GEN. KNEEDLER: There are two responses. 

One, we -- we think it is necessarily implicit in the 

statutory framework that Congress would have wanted the 

court to be able to rule on the interlocutory 

injunction, but the -- but the second point I think that 

-- that reinforces this proposition, again, if you go 

back to the Hobbs Judicial Review Act, it has a 

provision not only for interlocutory injunctions, which 

is what we're really talking about here, but a provision 

for a temporary -- for a court to issue a temporary stay 

upon a showing of irreparable injury to allow the status 

quo to be maintained pending the court's ruling on the 

interlocutory injunction.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Then why 

doesn't that provide the broader authority under 

(b)(3)(B) stay provision that your friends on the other 

side are arguing for?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well, it may -- that may 

well be the right answer, is to read (b)(3)(B) --

(b)(3)(B)'s opening that -- which says a petition for 

review does not in itself stay the order -- is very 

similar to the language in the opening of 2349(b) which 

is the interlocutory injunctive language of the Hobbs 

Judicial Review Act. It says the mere filing of the 

petition doesn't stay or suspend the order. It says

stay or suspend the order, and it says stay, and then it 

says but a court may -- I forget the precise language --

restrain or suspend the order reflecting pending 

judicial review; and it refers to that as an 

interlocutory injunction.

 But it says if the Petitioner shows that 

irreparable injury would occur before the court has a 

chance to rule even on the interlocutory injunction, it 

can issue what's called a temporary stay to maintain the 

status quo until it can look at the -- at the -- at the 

interim relief.

 Well, if -- if that -- if that background 

rule is not misplaced, that would allow for some 

separation of the sort of emergency motion for a stay, a 

hold fast sort of situation, for the court to be able to 

evaluate the merits. But when it gets to what the Hobbs 

Act refers to as an injunction, then (f)(2) kicks in, 

interlocutory injunction pending -- pending judicial 

review.

 So that would be -- that would be an 

underlying statutory basis for allowing the court to --

to issue a temporary order to allow the -- to allow the 

proceeding to go forward, but we think it should be done 

in a timely way. The Hobbs Judicial Review Act 

contemplates a rather casual, up to 60 days that such a

temporary stay should remain in effect. We think in 

many cases under the immigration laws the court should 

be able to act on the stay application more quickly than 

that.

 I did want -- I did also want to stress the 

-- the policy purposes that Justice Kennedy raised in --

in an earlier question, and that is the -- the thrust-

the whole thrust of the 1996 amendments to the 

Immigration Act was to expedite the removal of aliens, 

particularly criminal aliens, but not all -- but all 

aliens in fact. And Congress did several things when it 

did that. It repealed the prior provision where that 

said the mere filing of petition for review 

automatically stayed the removal unless the courts 

ordered -- ordered otherwise. And it also repealed the 

prior provision that said that the alien -- if the alien 

left the country, including -- that was construed to 

mean pursuant to deportation order, he could no longer 

challenge the removal order outside the country.

 Congress changed completely that and it said 

you had can now challenge the order of removal from 

outside the country, and it basically reversed the 

presumption with respect to whether - whether the filing 

of the petition for review stays -- stays the order of 

removal. Congress said, No, it does not unless the

courts ordered otherwise.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you would expect the 

standard to be in the (b)(3)(B) provision. It says that 

no automatic stay unless the court otherwise orders, 

period. That's the end of it.

 So one wonders whether this would think that 

the normal standard for a stay would apply. And then 

(f)(2) is separated by several pages and (f)(1) is 

dealing with something where we understand it. It says 

no mass injunctions against the enforcement of a 

provision. But (2) is really puzzling what it relates 

to, is it supposed to have some relationship to (1)? 1 

says you can't enjoin the enforcement of a provision of 

the law.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well, (f)(1) is directed at 

-- in large part at programmatic challenges. It 

provides -- it prohibits courts from enjoining or 

restraining the operation of part 4 of the INA which --

which is the provision that deals with deportation, 

adjudication of deportation and exclusions and carrying 

out those orders, which by the way we think is the 

reason it says enjoin or restrain, because it's talking 

about programmatic type actions, and restrain -- the 

word restraint is sometimes used to be something in an 

absolute prohibition, just -- just to limit it, whereas

on "enjoin" is necessary under (f)(2) because it --

because what is being enjoined or stayed is a vary 

discreet act. You can have an injunction barring 

removal or -- or you don't.

 But I -- I think a further answer to your 

question, Justice Ginsburg, is that (f)(2) says under 

this section, which means that it is obviously referring 

to court orders entered in the course of -- of removal 

proceedings under section 1252, and when a court finally 

gets to the merits in a petition for review in a court 

of appeals, the court if it decides that there is a flaw 

-- excuse me -- a legal flaw in the BIA or immigration 

judge's decision, it vacates the decision and -- and --

and remands.

 Injunctions are not necessary in that -- in 

that kind of review, so-

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So in this -- in 

this case involving a denial of a motion to reopen, what 

the court of appeals is supposed to do is to look ahead 

and see if this person has shown by clear and convincing 

evidence that they shouldn't be removed; and if they 

haven't, then their -- their removal can't be blocked, 

even for example if the court of appeals thinks, well, 

yes, they should have gotten their motion to reopen.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: No, no. The way -- the way

I would understand it to operate is that the -- the 

alien would have to make a clear and convincing showing 

that he is entitled to have the motion to reopen 

granted. Because if the motion to reopen is granted, 

that vacates the final order of removal and therefore 

there is no longer a final order of removal pursuant to 

which the alien could be removed.

 And I did want to respond to your suggestion 

that maybe the standard should be more lenient with 

respect to motions to reopen. With respect, I think 

that's the opposite of what the rule should be, if 

anything; because the final -- the review of the final 

order of removal is the main show; and in that -- in 

that situation, the alien is actually challenging the 

order of removal.

 In a case like this where the order of 

removal was a long time ago, and the -- and the -- the 

alien sought judicial review of that and that was 

denied, the only thing before the court is the -- is the 

motion to reopen. And staying -- a judicial order 

staying the denial of a motion to reopen is meaningless. 

In order to get the relief preventing removal you need a 

stay of removal, which really effectively directs DHS-

as we think it does in all cases -- directs DHS not to 

execute the order of removal that was -- t hat was

already previously entered.

 And also the denial of a motion to reopen, 

especially like the one at issue in this case, where the 

question is whether the alien has shown -- has produced 

material evidence of changed circumstances, that is 

reviewed as this Court said in its decision in Abudu, 

under an abuse of discretion standard. So it would be 

very likely -- very unlike that an alien would prevail.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This provision 

applies to us as well, I take it, right?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Yes, we -- we believe it 

would.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if there is a 

cert petition filed on behalf of an alien subject to 

removal, and he asks for a stay of removal, we have to 

decide whether he meets the clear and convincing 

evidence standard.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: For -- for purposes of 

granting a stay, yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We should have -- we 

should have done this in this case, but I assume you 

suspended removal of the Petitioner on your own?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well, the Court granted the 

stay in connection with the -- with the granting of --

of certiorari in my case.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask just a 

technical point?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: One of the -- the motion 

to reopen was based on changed circumstances in the 

Cameroon. But there was also this independent 

application for adjustment of his status, which was 

turned down because it was a successive motion.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: My understanding is that 

that adjustment could not have been asked for earlier 

because his wife didn't come with -- until after.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: If I -- yes. Well, he -- he 

did seek -- he did seek, the first time around he sought 

a remand for consideration of his adjustment of status 

application, but one of the requirements to be eligible 

for that is that a visa be available, and a visa was not 

then available, and nothing in the Act requires that 

deportation hearings be held up until a visa becomes 

available.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but now he would 

qualify, except that it's a successive motion. So it 

seems earlier he was premature and now he's too late.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: But -- but Congress was 

quite explicit; it only wanted one -- one motion to

reopen, except in the case of asylum or withholding of 

deportation. It wanted -- it wanted the proceedings to 

come to an end. And that's -- the circumstances of this 

case powerfully reinforce what Congress --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just ask a 

question?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This person is married to 

a citizen, has an American citizen child.  Is there any 

way that his status could be adjusted? It can't in this 

procedural situation because it is a successive motion.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: He could -- he could apply 

for an immigrant visa from abroad. Now there may be 

situations in which -- in which by virtue of having been 

removed, there is a bar to his getting that, but that is 

subject to waiver. So really what the alien's 

adjustment status in the United States is discretionary 

if there is a piece of available -- it is discretionary 

from abroad. All -- it's really a alternate venue 

provision, where the alien applies from abroad.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: GEN. KNEEDLER, when we 

entered this stage, did we violate (f)(2)?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: I -- I think it would be 

analogous to what I was saying before, that the -- this 

Court like a court of appeals has the authority to -- to

freeze the status quo while it can decide the pertinent 

legal issue, and the pertinent legal issue before 

this --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Where -- where do we get 

that authority if (f)(2) means what you say?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well, as I explained, we do 

not -- we do not challenge the ability of a court to 

decided -- to freeze the status quo while ruling on the 

motion for stay.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what court would ever 

do anything else? I mean, why if you were granting a 

stay, would you not want to do that so you can fully 

consider the issues?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well, but there's -- it's 

not two stages; it's three. The -- a stay of removal 

is, under the Hobbs Act terms, an interlocutory 

injunction. That can last -- judicial review in the 

Ninth Circuit can last four years, so if a stay is 

granted, you could have an interlocutory injunction in 

place for a long time. The temporary stay is just while 

the court is ruling, considering the interlocutory 

injunction.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But this is a longer 

temporary stay than you conceded a few moments ago. I

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LINDSAY C. HARRISON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. HARRISON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 I'd like to start with the point that the 

government contends that this Court or any court of 

appeals could impose a stay to consider the stay motion. 

And, respectfully, I don't believe that is consistent 

with the text of (f)(2), and I think that the fact that 

the government must stray from the text is a sign of how 

absurd the results would be if (f)(2) were applied to 

stays.

 Now, the reason they must stray from the 

text is that the text says "notwithstanding any other

provision of law," which means notwithstanding the Hobbs 

Act and notwithstanding the All Risk Act, which is where 

I believe my brother was indicating this Court would get 

authority to impose such a stay.

 Now, I think the fact that there are cases 

where such a need would arise, as in Justice Breyer's 

hypothetical, is exactly why this Court applies a 

presumption against interpreting statutes as restricting 

the equitable authority of the courts, unless there is a 

clear statement to the contrary, which --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but you still have a 

differential on the Friday to Monday night hypothetical. 

You wouldn't apply, or would you, the same standard that 

you would apply on Monday for the next -- on Monday for 

the next year and a half?

 MS. HARRISON: Well, Your Honor, the (f)(2) 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because you have the same 

problem under your standard as the government does under 

its.

 MS. HARRISON: Well, that's true. You'd 

have to show likelihood of success. But in -- in the 

situation where you could consider the equities, if the 

equities were strong enough and demonstrated in the stay 

application, then it wouldn't be difficult for the court

to decide whether the balance of the factors justified 

implementing a stay in that situation. Under (f)(2), 

the court would have to decide the question outright. 

And, again, (f)(2) does not mean any predictive 

language; it just says, has the individual demonstrated 

and shown by clear and convincing evidence that removal 

is prohibited by law? Under the traditional standard, 

there is a -- the court is allowed to consider whether 

the individual is likely to show success on the merits.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think that if you do 

not prevail, and we say clear and convincing evidence is 

the standard, that courts are not entitled to consider 

equity?

 MS. HARRISON: Well, Your Honor, I heard my 

brother as indicating that if you meet the (f)(2) 

standard, then -- then the court can consider the 

equities so as to deprive the individual of the stay, 

but that if you cannot meet the (f)(2) standard, then 

the question is closed and there is no consideration.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: About your position, is it 

your contention that if we grant -- if we determine 

clear and convincing is the standard, that equities are 

not relevant to that calculus?

 MS. HARRISON: Yes, Your Honor, in the event 

that the individual does not meet (f)(2). If the

individual meets (f)(2), then I do believe the court 

would go on to consider the equities. But in the event 

that the individual has met the (f)(2) standard, the 

court could simply grant the petition on the merits, and 

there is no need to go about considering the equities 

because the individual has shown that -- by clear and 

convincing evidence -- that removal is prohibited as a 

matter of law.

 And that is the second point I want to get 

to, which is Your Honor's question about, isn't this a 

standard that sounds a lot more like it is directed at 

district courts because -- I think you are right, Your 

Honor, and I think it does sound like that standard 

because I so think that was where it was intended to 

apply. And the phrase "under this section" does not 

modify the word "enjoin"; it modifies the word "final 

order of removal." And to ascribe the government's 

reading to it would require you to move that phrase from 

where Congress placed it in the statute, to after the 

word "enjoin."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess General 

Kneedler's point is that clear and convincing shifts a 

little, depending on how long you've got to look at it. 

If you've only got a day or a few hours before the 

removal is going to take place, you can say this is

convincing enough based on what I have had a chance to 

look at. But -- and therefore you could enter, I guess, 

what may be called the temporary stay to get more 

briefing from the government or whatever. But you may 

find out when you look at it a little more deeply that 

it's not clear and convincing. What's wrong with that?

 MS. HARRISON: Well, Your Honor, if the 

Court were to interpret clear and convincing as a more 

flexible standard, then I don't think -- you know, I 

don't disagree with Your Honor's characterization of it. 

But I still think that, regardless of how you interpret 

clear and convincing, that the equities would not be 

part of the calculus.

 And I also think that the fact that clear 

and convincing sounds like a standard Congress would 

have addressed to district courts, the fact that (f)(2) 

says "no" courts, not -- not just the "courts of 

appeals," the fact that it references an "alien" and not 

a "petitioner" are -- and the fact that it is addressed 

to instances where the entry or execution is prohibited 

by law as opposed to the order itself being unlawful are 

all signs that Congress intended this provision to apply 

both in the district courts and in the court of appeals.

 And I would also note that (a)(5), which is 

a provision the government pointed to, was not in the

1996 statute it was added in 2005, and the 

constitutionality of that provision continues to be 

litigated. And, moreover, there are habeas cases in the 

district courts that persist where (f)(2) has real 

application and where Congress's intent that an 

injunction, not a stay, but an injunction be very 

difficult to obtain --

JUSTICE BREYER: 1225?

 MS. HARRISON: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Was I right or wrong?

 MS. HARRISON: I believe you are right, and 

I believe that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Are you sure? Because --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- you didn't mention it. 

If I am right, why didn't you mention it?

 MS. HARRISON: I did not mention it in my 

opening, Your Honor, and that was my error. I believe 

habeas is one example -- and habeas in the expedited 

removal context, where the provisions would apply. And 

-- and I think, as this court made clear in Saint Cyr, 

Congress did intend for some habeas actions to persist 

in the '96 IIRIRA statute. And in those cases, (f)(2) 

would apply, would have real impact.

 And I would also note that if the Court were

to accept the government's interpretation of the term 

"enjoin," that it only applies in stays and that doesn't 

have application elsewhere, then you would be required 

to interpret Congress's use of the word "enjoin" to be 

not really inclusive of stays but as coterminous with 

the word "stay." But Congress didn't use the word 

"stay" it (f)(2). It used the word "enjoin." And the 

fact that that word choice was different from the word 

it used in (b)(3)(B) I think is a clear indication that 

Congress had something different. It didn't 

cross-reference stay and didn't use the word "stays," 

and it articulated a standard that seems more 

appropriate for district courts adjudicating permanent 

injunctive relief than courts of appeals hearing a 

temporary application for a stay.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the standard you 

think should apply under (b)(3)(B) is a standard that 

describes as applicable to temporary injunctions. The 

word -- there is substantial likelihood of success on 

the merits and irreparable harm -- that is the standard 

preliminary injunction, not preliminary stay. The 

preliminary injunction standard. So the two words 

certainly overlap.

 MS. HARRISON: Yes, Your Honor. There is 

overlap, and the standard that is applied by the courts,

if there is no statute to the contrary, is the same. 

But here Congress expressed an intention to treat 

injunctive relief differently and articulated a standard 

that was higher than injunctive relief.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask this one 

real quick: Do you understand -- is your understanding 

that the government's interpretation of the statute that 

our stay in this case violated the statute?

 MS. HARRISON: Yes, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. 

Harrison.

 General Kneedler, Ms. Harrison, the Court 

entered a very expedited briefing and arguments schedule 

in this case that unfortunately fell over the holiday 

season, and we appreciate very much that this must have 

imposed a burden on you had and your colleagues. Thank 

you.

 The case is submitted.
