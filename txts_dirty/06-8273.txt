 (10:01 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Danforth v. Minnesota.

 Mr. Butler.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. BUTLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BUTLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In this case, the Minnesota Supreme Court 

held that this Court had prevented it from deciding for 

itself which State prisoners can go into Minnesota State 

courts to raise Federal constitutional challenges to 

their conviction. This is incorrect.

 A State court is free to fashion -- the 

State courts are free to fashion their own jurisprudence 

as to who may raise a Federal constitutional question in 

State court in the context that if you hear State courts 

and State legislatures can make their own policy 

decisions about the costs and benefits of allowing State 

prisoners to challenge their otherwise final convictions 

based on new rules of Federal constitutional criminal --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I propose if the 

State of Minnesota really cared about this, it could 

have its own confrontation rule. Does it have a

confrontation rule?

 MR. BUTLER: The State constitution, Justice 

Kennedy, has a confrontation clause. Its jurisprudence 

on the confrontation clause, its own, is identical to 

this Court's jurisprudence. So, yes, theoretically, a 

Petitioner could always go in and make a State court 

challenge to his State court conviction. The question 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That means the State isn't 

necessarily tied in knots. It has the option to do 

substantively what it chooses.

 MR. BUTLER: The question in this case, Your 

Honor, I think, is that whether -- is the question of 

whether it has to. Yes, a State prisoner can make a 

State court challenge to his conviction. The question 

is, does he have to? In this case, Mr. Danforth 

challenges his conviction under the Federal 

Constitution.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, page 2 of your reply 

brief, the yellow brief, you take issue with the State, 

and you say the State is wrong if there is a decision 

either way on the confrontation clause and it's 

questionable under Federal law, we can review it. I can 

concede that's right, but that doesn't get you home. 

That's the problem.

MR. BUTLER: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That is the problem. 

You're now creating a regime in which State courts are 

reaching questions that we said ought not to be reached 

for final convictions.

 MR. BUTLER: Your Honor --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that was the basis on 

which we decided Crawford.

 MR. BUTLER: Your Honor, it's simply a 

regime under which the State court, as it can in any 

number of other contexts, can choose to consider the 

merits of a litigant's claim. The Federal question --

the Federal question here is -- well, there are two. In 

this case, it's whether Federal law prevents the State 

court from hearing it, but the substantive Federal 

question is whether Mr. Danforth's conviction violates 

the confrontation clause.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you think that our 

holding in Teague was that it did, but we're not going 

to let you out of jail?

 MR. BUTLER: I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You think that's really 

what we said in Teague, that even though your 

constitutional rights were violated, we're going to 

foreclose the remedy of habeas corpus? I -- I find it

difficult to believe that that -- you know, any 

responsible court could make such a determination.

 MR. BUTLER: Your Honor, what the Teague 

Court did was set up a procedural and a prudential limit 

on a defense available for the State in the particular 

form of habeas corpus.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That issue is not a 

necessary part of your case at all, but you don't have 

to suggest that you could depart. You could do less 

than Teague. For example, Griffith. You can accept 

that as a given because it doesn't touch your case. 

Isn't that so?

 MR. BUTLER: That's correct, Your Honor. 

Griffith sets forth, as we see it, the minimum 

requirements of Federal law, that a new rule must be 

applied to all cases that were pending when the new rule 

is announced. That's what the Federal Constitution 

requires.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Federal rules 

don't have minimums and maximums. They have a rule. 

And as Justice Kennedy pointed out, you can have a State 

rule under the State constitution that goes further. It 

seems to me that the States' determination to apply 

Crawford retroactively must be based on a disagreement 

with this Court's Teague analysis, which refers back to

the substantive elements of Crawford. So, in other 

words, the disagreement at bottom is a disagreement 

about how to read the substantive requirements of 

Crawford.

 MR. BUTLER: Respectfully, Mr. Chief 

Justice, I don't think that's necessarily true. I think 

the disagreement, if there is one, is with this Court's 

policy decision in Teague to -- that the Court announced 

in Teague as to whether to allow such challenges. 

There's no disagreement as to the substance of Crawford 

or to the substance of the Sixth Amendment. Nobody has 

ever reached that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do you --

I understand your point. Teague has both elements to 

it. But if you're applying Teague, there are certain 

exceptions that are based on exactly what the underlying 

right is, what the Crawford right is. Is it a watershed 

rule? Is it something else? And the court makes a 

determination as a matter of Federal law on those 

points. And what you're arguing for is discretion in 

the State to disagree with those substantive 

determinations.

 MR. BUTLER: What we're arguing for, 

Mr. Chief Justice, is discretion in the State to 

disagree with the general policy rule that a court will

not consider a new rule when considering the validity of 

a conviction on, in Teague's case, habeas or on 

collateral review.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a general policy 

rule, but it may well, as in the Crawford case, as a 

good example, have affected this Court's initial 

determination to strike off in a new direction. We did 

so knowing that there's a possibility that we wouldn't 

upset final convictions.

 MR. BUTLER: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And I think it is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- to that effect.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it not a substantive 

determination of Federal law when you say that this 

constitutional change that we're making in this case or 

that we have made in a past case is not retroactive? 

That means there was no constitutional violation in the 

past prior to the announcement of this case, and what 

the State -- what you want the State court to be able to 

say is yes, there is a Federal constitutional violation 

for which we're going to give a remedy in habeas.

 MR. BUTLER: I think, Justice Scalia and 

Justice Kennedy, if I could address your points in turn, 

on Justice Scalia's question about whether there was or 

was not a constitutional violation, if the Court is

really holding that there was -- that something -- that 

there was no constitutional violation at the time 

Petitioner's conviction became final or at the time 

Mr. Bockting's conviction became final in the habeas 

case, then what the Court is really holding is that 

Crawford didn't just interpret the confrontation clause; 

it somehow changed the confrontation clause, that the 

confrontation clause meant -- that the confrontation 

clause said one thing at one point and now says 

something else.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's exactly what 

Crawford means, and I think that's exactly what 

happened. That's what it means, whether it's a new 

rule. What does a new rule mean? It means it didn't 

used to be the rule, but it is the rule after this case.

 Now, you can argue, and there are many 

originalists who would agree with you, that there 

shouldn't be such a thing as a new rule, but once you've 

-- once you've agreed that there can be new rules, if 

this Court says this is a new rule, we acknowledge it 

wasn't the rule before, but it's new, it will not have 

retroactive effect, it seems to me that the State would 

be contradicting that ruling by saying oh, in our view 

the law used to be exactly what you say it newly is.

 MR. BUTLER: But the question, Your Honor --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But your basic position is 

that we should not be making new law. We should be --

we might have misinterpreted the law over the years, 

but, basically, this Court has no power to change the 

text of the Constitution or its meaning. I guess 

Justice Scalia's position is we have all that power in 

the world.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: My position is we have 

asserted all that power in the world.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is -- there is 

-- it's not as though we have a new rule, and we apply 

it from this day forward. Crawford is retroactive at 

least for cases that are not yet final. When they were 

on trial, Crawford wasn't there, but maybe somewhere 

toward the end of the appellate process, lo and behold, 

they can take advantage of it.

 So it's a question of where you want to cut 

it off. And at one time, didn't this Court cut it off 

in a different place?

 MR. BUTLER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it did. 

In fact, for centuries everything this Court did was 

always retroactive, as the Court knows.

 And then we got the Linkletter balancing

test, and then later on we got Griffith and Teague, and 

the Court has refined, usually through the scope of 

Federal habeas corpus --

JUSTICE ALITO: And during the period 

between Linkletter and Griffith, did the State -- if the 

Supreme Court said that a decision was not retroactive, 

did State supreme courts feel free to apply it 

retroactively?

 MR. BUTLER: It -- there -- there doesn't 

seem to be any case law on that point, Your Honor, that 

I'm aware of. State courts usually, as they do today, 

usually followed this Court's retroactivity decision. 

But it is unclear whether they thought they had to or 

whether they just chose to. The question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can a State -- can 

they pick -- can a State pick and choose? Can it say 

that we are going to allow Crawford claims to be applied 

retroactively, but other claims, we're not going to?

 MR. BUTLER: I think, when it -- if you 

consider, Mr. Chief Justice, that the Teague rule is a 

procedural rule about who gets to make what claims, then 

I think the answer to your question is yes. The State 

court could say --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, and if you 

think that the Teague rule is an assessment of the

substantive -- part of the substantive constitutional 

interpretation, an assessment about what the impact of 

Crawford is versus other decisions, then I guess they 

couldn't, right?

 MR. BUTLER: Well, it depends on the impact 

in what -- in what setting, Your Honor. It -- the --

the Teague rule -- and Teague, itself, and every case 

this Court has ever -- in which this Court has ever 

considered Teague, has come from one procedural posture: 

Federal habeas corpus review of State court convictions.

 It is over that posture that this Court 

exercises both supervisory power and control to 

interpret the various Federal habeas statutes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, even -- even outside 

of the habeas context, we -- we decided a case, Hudson 

v. Walker, one or two terms ago. It was a no-knock 

case. We said that, even if there is a no-knock 

violation, the exclusionary rule does not apply. This 

would be too costly an extension of the exclusionary 

rule and would bring the -- would make the Fourth 

Amendment a disruptive force.

 Under your view, I take it, the State, even 

in -- in its trial proceedings subject to direct review, 

could disagree with that and take a Federal concept, 

no-knock, and then apply the exclusionary rule, thereby

forcing us to make the -- to draw the very lines that we 

said we ought not to draw in Hudson.

 MR. BUTLER: No, Your Honor.

 First of all, what Hudson -- the Hudson case 

asked was whether exclusion of evidence was required 

under the Fourth Amendment when the violation of the 

Fourth Amendment was a no-knock violation.

 The word "required" appears throughout the 

opinion in Hudson, and the answer was no, it doesn't. 

The Fourth Amendment doesn't require exclusion of 

evidence.

 But there was no suggestion in -- in Hudson 

that the State court could not then say, here is a 

Fourth Amendment violation. We need to come up with 

what the remedy is. The Constitution doesn't require us 

to suppress the evidence, so we are -- we either choose 

not to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- but you agree with 

me, then, that under your position, the State could 

apply an exclusionary rule.

 MR. BUTLER: Yes, Your Honor, it could under 

State law. And if --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Based on the 

distinction between right and remedy, a distinction that 

is -- that in countless areas of the law we -- we have

said is -- is an ephemeral one?

 MR. BUTLER: Well, the -- that is not based 

on that distinction. That is one way to look at it, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that in -- in the Hudson context, it 

is definitely a question of right and remedy.

 There's no question in Hudson that the 

defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were violated. The 

question is what remedy is required by the Constitution.

 Here, Mr. Danforth wants the Minnesota State 

Court to consider whether his constitutional rights were 

violated. It did not hold that they were not. It held 

that it could not consider the merits of his claim 

because of Teague.

 And in other settings this Court, in its 

other limitations on the availability of habeas corpus, 

has described these prudential rules like Teague as 

gateway claims.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Butler, let me -- this 

is a habeas case, but I assume the same issue could come 

up in a -- in a direct appeal to the State Supreme 

Court. Is it your position that in a direct appeal, the 

State can determine to be retroactive constitutional 

rights that we have said are not retroactive, on direct 

appeal, now, not habeas?

 MR. BUTLER: As long, Justice Scalia, as the

State acknowledges that it is using State law to do so, 

that it is -- that it is not mismanaging this Court's 

retroactivity jurisprudence. In other words, as long as 

it doesn't think, well, we -- we must do this.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If it bases its decision on 

the Federal Constitution, and we have said that this 

Federal constitutional rule is not retroactive, what --

what do they say on a direct appeal?

 MR. BUTLER: On a -- on a direct --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And my next question is 

going to be whatever they say, when it comes up to us, 

what do we do?

 MR. BUTLER: It would -- it would depend on 

the facts of the case, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm -- I'm confused on 

this one, because I thought it was part of our 

retroactivity jurisprudence that the States must apply 

that new rule while the case is still in the pipeline, 

while it is on direct appeal, not that they -- well, 

they just may, but they absolutely must apply it 

retroactively. I thought that's what Griffith said.

 MR. BUTLER: That is, Your Honor, what 

Griffith says, and that's -- that's what -- that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: My case was not in the 

pipeline. The prosecution began after our new decision.

Okay? And it comes up to the State Supreme Court. Can 

the State Supreme Court, despite the fact that we've 

said the decision is not retroactive, make it 

retroactive? And your answer is yes?

 MR. BUTLER: My answer is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Habeas or not?

 MR. BUTLER: My answer, Your Honor, is that 

if the -- the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If it comes up after --

if the prosecution is after the Federal decision, of 

course, the decision has to apply.

 MR. BUTLER: Yes, I think that's correct, 

Justice Ginsburg. The decision would apply. If the 

prosecution starts after this Court announces a new rule 

and then says that it is not retroactive -- when you 

announce that it is not retroactive, it is not 

retroactive to cases that are already final.

 If the case hasn't even begun yet, then, of 

course -- then, yes, then the new rule would apply.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does your -- does 

your approach apply to legislative enactment's as well? 

Let's say Congress passes a law and it provides as 

particular remedy, and it says this remedy shall not be 

retroactive but only apply in new cases.

 Can the State say well, we think it ought to

apply to old cases, pending cases on habeas, or 

whatever, and so we are going to apply this 

retroactively, even though Congress said it's only 

prospective?

 MR. BUTLER: I think that's a -- that's a 

somewhat different question, Your Honor, and it would --

it would depend on if -- if Congress passed a law that 

said no State court shall apply retroactively something 

or other --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. They just 

say here's a new remedy, maybe a glance and exclusionary 

remedy in cases where we have held one isn't required --

can the State allow that retroactively, even though 

Congress -- a Federal remedy, even though Congress has 

said this Federal remedy is only prospective?

 MR. BUTLER: In the past, Your -- I think --

I think the short answer to your question, Mr. Chief 

Justice, is yes. And I think the reason it can is 

because, if you look at, for example -- if this is a 

question of remedy, then I -- then the State courts have 

all the power to grant more remedies, to grant more 

expansive --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your reliance 

on this ancient distinction between right and remedy --

I mean if Congress says you don't have a remedy if it's

retroactive, it's hard to say what kind of right you 

have.

 MR. BUTLER: If, Your Honor -- think about 

the -- the tax cases, for example, American Trucking and 

McKesson, the case -- the companion case. In both of 

those cases, especially McKesson, the Court held that 

where there has been a violation of somebody's 

constitutional rights and the -- and the State owes that 

person some sort of a remedy, then the State can give 

whatever remedy the minimum requirements of the Federal 

Constitution or Federal law are, but can also go 

further.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure, as a matter of 

State law.

 MR. BUTLER: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But here you are 

arguing in favor of retro-application of Federal law. 

There is no issue -- as Justice Kennedy pointed out, you 

can have a State confrontation clause and do whatever 

you want with it. But you are relying on the Federal 

provision.

 MR. BUTLER: What -- what we are relying on 

-- we are relying, Mr. Chief Justice, on the substance 

of the Sixth Amendment, yes. That is the substantive 

claim Mr. Danforth makes.

effect. And you are saying, that so long as the State 

common law does not give less by way of remedy and 

relief than the Federal decision requires, the State is 

free, as a matter of State remedial common law, to do 

more. That's your point, isn't it?

 MR. BUTLER: That is absolutely my point, 

Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You are saying that, 

ultimately, the State's choice in this case rests upon a 

choice of State common law about procedure leading to 

remedy.

 MR. BUTLER: It is not even just State 

common law, Justice Souter. It is state statutory law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. I would 

have thought the very least Teague is, is Federal common 

lawful. In other words, this is the Federal law of 

remedies. I think it is more than that. I think it is 

substantive constitutional -- substantive Federal 

constitutional law. But it's at least Federal common 

law, and doesn't Federal common law preempt State common 

law.

 MR. BUTLER: Only, Mr. Chief Justice, if the 

Federal interest is so strong as to outweigh all of the

State court interests. And when it comes to the 

remedial question of does this person have a right to go 

to State court and challenge his conviction, that is 

quintessentially the matter of State law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That always assumes that 

that's a remedial question, and that the question is not 

was the Constitution violated at the time this act 

occurred. That -- if that's the question, then you 

acknowledge that the State can't change the situation.

 MR. BUTLER: That's true, Justice Scalia. 

That if this Court -- if Teague is a rule that says what 

the Constitution was at a particular time, then it is 

much harder for us, we would probably have to make a 

State law claim.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you can say -- it 

is a little odd that the State executive can say, yes, 

as far as we're concerned, we like the new law, or what 

was always the law but the Court wasn't perceptive 

enough to see that, we like it, so we're not going to 

raise Teague. It would be an anomaly, would it not, 

that the executive of the State is not bound by Teague, 

but the courts are?

 MR. BUTLER: That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. And that's -- the waiver doctrine about 

Teague shows why Teague is not a decision about what the

law was.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that the State 

executive can do that with respect to any Federal law 

that it's authorized to implement, simply choose not to, 

couldn't it? That's prosecutorial discretion.

 MR. BUTLER: No, Justice Scalia, 

respectfully, I don't think that's true. If the law at 

the time of Mr. Danforth's conviction became final said 

there's no confrontation violation, and we go to State 

court or Federal habeas court, for that matter, and the 

State chooses to say we don't want to apply Teague, 

we'll take him on on his Crawford claim. That, under a 

view that the law has changed, that allows the State 

executive branch through waiver or even worse, through 

procedural default, inaction, to change the substance of 

Federal law.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to write an 

opinion which begins with the sentence, "This Court has 

no interest in the extent to which its constitutional 

decisions upset final judgments"?

 MR. BUTLER: No, Justice Kennedy, I don't 

think that's what the opinion should start with. I 

don't necessarily think that that's true. I don't know 

that there's no interest in much of anything in this 

case.

When you weigh and balance the interests, 

however, the interests of the State courts in 

controlling access to their courthouse doors, in 

reviewing that their own judgments -- I mean, Teague 

gets back to a comity decision. Whatever Teague is is 

based almost not exclusively but primarily on comity and 

respect for State courts. Federal courts are not --

JUSTICE ALITO: If Crawford had been a 

decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court, is it clear 

what retroactivity rule they would have applied?

 MR. BUTLER: No, Justice Alito, it's not. 

The State court has used in the past the Linkletter 

balancing test. It's also used something akin to 

Teague. And then in this case, they held for Federal 

rules they have to use Teague.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Butler, if as you say 

Teague is, in effect, a comity rule, then what is your 

answer, in effect, to Justice Scalia's point that we 

make a decision when we come down with a substantive 

legal judgment about the Constitution, we make a 

decision as to whether the rule is retroactive or not? 

And he says that if you look at Teague as simply, in 

effect, a comity decision, that's inconsistent with the 

determination that we have made, because if you say 

okay, we as a State will apply it earlier than the Feds

say we have to, you, in effect, are changing the 

substantive determination that we have made, that the 

decision is not retroactive.

 What is the retroactivity analysis that 

underlies your comity analysis of Teague?

 MR. BUTLER: The retroactivity analysis, 

Your Honor, when this Court makes a decision is that, as 

Justice Ginsburg suggested earlier, Griffith. The Court 

says when it makes a new rule, when it announces what it 

believes to be a new rule, that it knows that it will 

apply to a certain group of cases.

 It doesn't know -- it can't know anything 

more than that, because the Court doesn't exercise 

control over other courts --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Alright, but let's be more 

specific. What does it know about retroactive 

application under Griffith?

 MR. BUTLER: That it will apply.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And it will apply to some 

cases that depend upon facts and have eventuated from 

trials that are --

MR. BUTLER: -- that are already finished.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. So that there's is 

going to be some retroactivity?

 MR. BUTLER: Yes, absolutely.

JUSTICE SOUTER: And if there is going to be 

some retroactivity, then I take it your position has got 

to be and is our substantive decisions are not so much 

retroactive or non-retroactive, but retroactively 

applied, to some extent, and not retroactively applied 

to others, and a State is free to apply it more 

retroactively than ours. Is that the nutshell?

 MR. BUTLER: That is the gravamen of our 

argument, Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So your answer to Justice 

Scalia is, I take it, not that the decision is 

retroactive or not, but there is a decision about the 

degree to which applications will be retroactive or not? 

That is what underlies your case?

 MR. BUTLER: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Then do you think the State 

is free to decide how and when and whether it will, 

quote, apply? I mean, simply to separate the law from 

the application of the law seems to me no answer at all.

 Is there any other area where you say well, 

yes, there was a Supreme Court decision; but whether to 

apply that decision is up to the State?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You're overlooking what I 

understand to be the basic distinction you're drawing. 

I know the Chief Justice has cast doubt on it. But I

think there is a basic distinction between rights and 

remedies.

 And you're holding -- I understand your 

position to be that the remedy may not be retroactive, 

even though the decision itself can assume that there 

would have been a violation from the beginning of the 

Constitution today we may have misinterpreted before. 

But if there is a violation of the right, then there's a 

decision about what kind of remedy shall be imposed.

 And you can say we will not impose a remedy 

for past wrongs, even though we must impose them in the 

future and we can let other states decide whether to 

post a remedy or not. And that's totally consistent 

with the holding that the violation is always 

retroactive, but the remedy may not be.

 MR. BUTLER: I think that's correct, Justice 

Stevens. When you talk about remedy --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it is the other 

way around which makes it problematic. You are going to 

say the remedy is retroactive even if there's no right. 

You're going to say where we have decided that there is 

no remedy and, therefore, if you have a right, it's -- I 

don't know what you get out of it -- you want to say, 

no, there is a remedy.

Justice, is that if there is a violation of the test of 

the Sixth Amendment confrontation clause, this Court 

decides what remedies are required, what remedies for 

certain people and perhaps for other people what 

remedies are not required. Justice Harlan in Mackey 

called it the body responsible for defining the scope of 

the -- what he called the writ, in other places, the 

adjudicatory process.

 In this case it's State post-conviction 

review. It is that body that decides whether there 

shall be either a remedy, you want to call it a remedy 

for the violation, you want to call it who decides 

whether the decision shall be applied retroactively, as 

opposed to whether it is retroactive. It is the 

group -- it is whoever is controlling the adjudicatory 

process.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's subject to the 

floor, that the floor that this Court sets, it must be 

retroactive to a certain extent.

 MR. BUTLER: That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. Subject to the floor, it is then up to the 

governing body to decide how much protection to give. 

And that gets back to Justice Stevens's point -- the 

States can always choose to give either -- you can call 

it a greater remedy, you can call it a larger

retroactive application, as long as the substance of 

Federal law doesn't change, then it is a State question.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It is the same as the 

question of whether to apply the exclusionary rule.

 MR. BUTLER: It is.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That was a remedial 

decision. Everybody agreed the knock and announce 

business was a violation. The only question was on 

remedy. And there are lots of rights that -- for which 

there's no remedy. Look at all our implied cause of 

action cases, you will find many, many examples of that.

 MR. BUTLER: In habeas corpus as well, 

Justice Stevens. If you file your habeas petition one 

day late, no remedy. If you don't preserve the issue in 

the trial court, no remedy.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you have to 

argue, and this is why I think the distinction has been 

rejected in so many other areas of the law, you have to 

argue that the remedy question is totally separate from 

an analysis of the right. Because otherwise, you are 

saying the State courts have the right to disagree with 

our determination of what the Federal right is. If you 

think the remedy, the question of remedy draws some 

substance from what the right is, which I would have 

thought is obviously the case, then it seems to me

you're asserting a power on the basis of the State court 

to overturn our Federal law determinations.

 MR. BUTLER: We are not asserting, Mr. Chief 

Justice, that the State court has the ability to 

disagree with this Court's interpretation of the Federal 

Constitution.

 What we are asserting is that the State 

courts and the State legislatures have the ability to 

decide who can come into State court and what claims the 

State court can listen to.

 And I want to -- before I -- my time, I 

wanted to address -- Justice Kennedy had a concern 

earlier about knowing the scope of the application of a 

right when you announce a substantive decision.

 And the answer to that, I believe, is that 

the court -- not only does it already know it's going to 

go -- it will apply to anything pending on direct 

review, but that -- that -- that question is much more 

complicated than it seems. Different States have 

different time lines for when something is pending on 

direct review. How long it takes an appeal to pass 

through the State court process? What requirements of 

the defendant are there?

 In Minnesota it takes about 15 months to run 

a direct appeal. And so a defendant can sit there for

15 months and know that he's probably going to get the 

benefit of any decision this Court announces. In 

another State it might take two years. In another State 

it might take six months. There's different groups of 

defendants -- even under the Griffith standard, we 

already don't have the sort of uniformity that the 

Respondent thinks is so -- thinks is so important in 

this area.

 There's always -- things are always left to 

the matter of State courts to -- to decide -- to have 

their own procedural rules and decide how best to use 

their adjudicatory processes, and all this Court can do 

is announce the best Federal rules it thinks the 

Constitution supports, have some idea of what the 

minimum requirements of those rules are going to be; and 

then it is up to the State courts to decide what other 

remedies to give for the violations that -- if this 

Court holds something is a violation, then it is up to 

the State courts to decide as a minimum who it will 

apply to.

 If there are no further questions, I'll 

reserve my time.

you, Mr. Butler.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK C. DIAMOND

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. DIAMOND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Federal law controls the retroactivity or 

non-retroactivity of new constitutional rulings. This 

Court determines the constitutional requirements --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, just at the 

outset, when you use the term retroactivity, are you 

saying there was no violation of the Constitution before 

the decision, or there just is no remedy for it?

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think in this --

this Court has made it clear in the retroactivity area 

that retroactivity is a question of the substantive 

constitutional standard that will applies to a specific 

defendant. I think the Court's cases from Payne, 

Griffith, Yates --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- one of the cases where 

the line is drawn when the expiration of the direct 

review has passed. Is it your view that at that 

particular point in time a constitutional violation 

either exists or it does not exist? It's not a remedy 

question?

 MR. DIAMOND: That's correct, Your Honor. I 

don't believe this is a matter of remedy. This Court,

for example, in Reynoldsville Casket wrote that Teague 

itself is not a limitation on remedy. What it is, is a 

limitation on the principle of retroactivity itself.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is part of that because of 

what's involved in expectations? That's the Smith case, 

where we said the determination of whether a 

constitutional decision is retroactive Is every bit as 

much a question of Federal law as the decision of the 

substantive right itself. We said that in Smith.

 MR. DIAMOND: Yes, Your Honor, and the point 

is that the substantive rights and retroactivity are not 

two different things.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And here the 

expectation -- in Smith it was the expectation of people 

in the private sector. Here the expectation is one of 

finality of judgments.

 MR. DIAMOND: Exactly, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then how do you -- how do 

you reconcile that answer with the point that your 

brother made just before he sat down, and that is, 

taking standard Griffith analysis, the application of a 

so-called new rule is going to vary depending on how 

long it takes a person on direct appeal to get through 

the State court system?

 And it seems to me that that is inconsistent

with your view that there has got to be one rule with 

respect to the date of application as a matter of 

substantive Federal law, because we know for a fact 

that, depending how long it takes to get through the 

State appellate system on direct review, the new rule 

may be applied and it may not be applied.

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, two points: First 

of all, I think Griffith is very clear, that finality is 

that point. Griffith is very clear, and it defines 

finality as that point when the direct appellate process 

has run, and this Court -- and the opportunity to 

petition this Court for review is over. Secondly, Banks 

II, a retroactivity case from this Court, says that it's 

up to the Federal courts to define finality. Remember 

in Banks II there was a question of whether the 

Pennsylvania courts passing on waiver requirements 

somehow destroyed the finality of --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I understand your -- your 

point about finality, and finality has a well-known 

operative effect. But one operative effect when the 

Federal courts have defined finality and have said it is 

not final until -- a case is not final until direct 

review is over -- one consequence of that is that a 

substantive Federal rule will be applied to an 

individual in one State whose crime and whose trial

procedure is different in time from that of a defendant 

in another State.

 So that the consequence is that the 

substantive rule will apply to some people who acted on 

date X and it will not apply to some people who acted on 

date X; and that, it seems to me, is inconsistent with 

your answer to Justice Stevens's question.

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, given the varied 

proceedings at the State level, that -- that is 

inevitable no matter what time this Court --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And if it is inevitable, I 

don't see how you can answer Justice Stevens's question 

the way you did.

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, the point in 

Griffith is that in terms of uniformity, this is -- in 

terms of providing similarly situated people, the best 

the Court can do in this area is to cut -- to make the 

point at finality --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And the finality point in 

effect establishes a way of calculating the application 

of a rule in any given State in any given case, but it 

will not result in the uniform application of the rule. 

Isn't that correct?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that's correct. You 

have to say that's correct.

(Laughter.)

 MR. DIAMOND: And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But I think you can also 

explain that the reason it's correct is the Court 

probably would have liked to say yes, we're making up a 

new rule; the Constitution didn't use to say this; and 

this rule will apply from now on to all actions taken by 

individuals from now on. But then, you know, Justice 

Harlan says my goodness, you're going to give relief to 

this individual and not give relief to other individuals 

who are making the same claim and already have cases 

pending? You have to treat them equally. So we will 

make an equitable exception for that.

 But basically, the existence of that 

exception does not prove that the Court was not 

purporting to make a substantive rule. There's an 

exception to the application of that substantive rule 

for pending cases, which is totally understandable.

 MR. DIAMOND: Which, Your Honor, is Griffith 

and is defined by Federal law.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can you give me an example 

of a case in which this Court candidly said, we're 

announcing a new rule which was not the law before? 

Aren't we always interpreting what we thought the intent 

of the framers was from the beginning, even though we

may have gotten it before? What is your best example of 

a new rule, in the sense it's a different rule of law as 

opposed to a different remedy? See, all these equitable 

considerations go to the remedy. But the notion we can 

make up a new rule of law at will strikes me as a very 

dramatic departure from what I understand the rule of 

law to require.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm really glad to hear 

that.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think the 

point -- this isn't Blackstone -- Blackstone is not the 

only view here. The point is that finality is -- is not 

a competing concern, but the point --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Finality is a condition 

for fashioning the right remedy. There's no doubt. 

Everything you say is necessary for treating litigants 

in a -- in a fair manner. But that all goes to remedy, 

not to the violation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't we call it a new 

rule in Teague?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- expectations as being 

questions of remedy?

 MR. DIAMOND: Excuse me, Your Honor.

-- your answer to Justice Souter's question earlier 

should be that there is uniformity. Some States are 

fast, some are slow, but in the end there is a final 

judgment which is a settled expectation, and the 

substance of the law honors settled expectations, which 

is finality.

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor -- and that point 

is -- the point of finality is a recognized point of 

what is necessary for the integrity of judicial 

decision-making.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's sort of like 

defining order as random order, isn't it?

 MR. DIAMOND: I disagree, Your Honor. I 

think that as Justice Harlan said in the -- in the 

Williams and Mackey dissents, there is -- a decision 

that is always subject to revision is really the 

functional equivalent of no decision at all. It's what 

makes judicial decisions judicial.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and the concern is a 

concern not so much.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the concern is not so 

much a concern not so much for the defendant here but 

for the States, isn't it? We don't want -- we think 

there is -- there is an important value implicit in 

habeas, and one of those values is that there be a limit

to the degree to which we are going to upset the settled 

expectations of the States. Isn't that right?

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, the State's 

interest here can be vindicated by the State by applying 

State law.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not the point. I 

thought that Teague was driven not by some abstract 

notion about finality, but the intrusion on State 

decision-making. Here was State that had conducted an 

entire process that appeared to be in line with what the 

Federal law then appeared to be. And then the State is 

told by some Federal habeas court, State, you've got to 

do it all over again, because you didn't -- you didn't 

predict that we were going to interpret the Constitution 

differently. I thought that the really motivating idea 

of Teague was it addressed the Federal forum and said, 

Federal forum, don't step on the States' toes, don't 

make them redo trials that have long since been over.

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I'm here 

representing the State of Minnesota, and the intrusion 

that I'm concerned about in this case is a State court 

judge adopting some Federal optional -- sort of Federal 

requirement, and applying it as opposed to using State 

law that can be reviewed and overturned and for which 

that State court judge is accountable to the citizenry

of the State.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I must say I have 

serious problems with your position in that regard.

 If you were not to prevail in this case 

and -- or, pardon me, if the Petitioner were to prevail 

in this case, and there were a ruling on what Crawford 

means, or doesn't mean, we could review it. I think the 

Petitioner is absolutely right on that point.

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think that it's 

difficult. If you look at, for example, the recent case 

in Minnesota, Krasky, dealing with essentially the same 

evidence that's at issue in this case, if the State was 

adopting Krasky as some State standard, then this Court 

wouldn't be in a position to review it. If it's 

adopting Krasky as a -- as the Federal standard, then 

the question is, how is it that the State is adopting 

something as a matter of the Federal Constitution that 

is not a Federal constitutional requirement?

 JUSTICE BREYER: The question I have is, to 

go back, you said two separate things. One is you say 

the question here is a matter of Federal law. I'll give 

you that. It's a matter of Federal law.

 But the question is, what's the content of 

the Federal law? Does the Federal law say to the States 

-- State, in a collateral review proceeding, you want to

apply Crawford retroactively to people whose convictions 

were long ago, do it, we don't care?

 And a lot of Teague says that should be the 

Federal rule, if it's called a Federal rule.

 But then you said a different thing, in 

answer to Justice Stevens. The different thing was but 

the substantive rule of Crawford only takes effect as of 

the day of Crawford and into the future.

 Now, on that position, or take any other 

date you want as one year earlier or whatever you're 

going to pick there, if you're right about that, you 

win.

 But how could you be right about what I call 

there a metaphysical point? Because on the metaphysics, 

as Justice Souter just pointed out, imagine three people 

who have three identical trials each one year before 

Crawford. The first person is called Crawford, and he 

wins.

 The second person is called Smith, and he's 

delayed forever in the appeals process.

 And the third person is called Jones, and he 

get a quick appeal, convicted, in jail at the time of 

Crawford.

 Now we know that the first two Crawford 

applies to, but metaphysically, if the law of Crawford

was the law at the time of the first two trials, why 

wasn't it the law in terms of what the rights are in 

respect to the third person whose trial was held at 

precisely the same time?

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, the point I think 

is that this is a point that Griffith makes, that when 

your conviction becomes final, that your stake -- if I 

can call it that -- in changes in the law come to a 

close.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You are saying 

metaphysically this Court has no power to enunciate new 

constitutional rules metaphysically, but we have done 

so, and Teague is full of references to new rules. "We 

therefore hold that implicit in the retroactivity 

approach we adopt today is the principle that habeas 

corpus cannot be used as vehicle to create new 

constitutional rules of criminal procedure unless those 

rules would be applied retroactively to all defendants."

 The opinion is full of new rules.

 So -- so, you know, we have violated 

metaphysics already. Having violated it, in adopting 

new constitutional rules, why should it be any surprise 

that we also violated it in the application of those 

rules? There should be no surprise at all. Don't get

hung up on metaphysics, Mr. Turner.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: In Crawford itself, it 

seems there was quite a bit of attention given to 

history long before the original interpretation of the 

clause. I guess that was unnecessary because we were 

making up new rules. Is that the --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: You've adopted Justice 

Scalia's approach through your silence, and I'd ask you 

whether -- whether -- whether there isn't just a simpler 

explanation that doesn't require us to go into Spinonza, 

Immanuel Kant, or even Aristotle. And the simpler 

explanation would be simply what Justice Stevens started 

with, that Teague is about remedies, and that we assume 

that the law was the law at the time of Crawford's 

trial, at the time of Smith's trial, and at the time of 

Jones' trial.

 But Jones is knocked out because he went to 

habeas. And that's what Teague is about. Habeas. And, 

therefore, if the State wants to apply Crawford 

retroactively, let everybody out of jail, that's their 

problem. Or their virtue. That's up to them.

 That's where Justice Stevens started, and 

that's what I would like to hear an answer to.

that, Mr. Turner, because that would place you in the 

position of saying what we are telling people in these 

Teague cases is oh, yes, the Constitution was violated, 

but we don't want to hear about it. I mean that's the 

alternative, to acknowledge that the Constitution is 

violated in all of these Teague cases, some of them 

being capital cases, and we nonetheless say well, too 

bad, it's on habeas.

 I'd like to think that's not what we're 

doing, that what we're saying is, this is a new 

constitutional rule, there was no constitutional 

violation before, and that's why we're letting it stand.

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you're 

handling these questions very well.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was not a question 

addressed to you, Mr. Diamond.

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think that, in 

terms of Teague as a remedial limitation, first of all, 

I don't think this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence 

at all supports that notion.

 I also think, for example, while certainly 

not directly at issue in the habeas area, in construing 

habeas, this Court said that Teague was not so much

about a standard of review as it was about the standard 

that applies itself. And so I think it's very difficult 

to square the notion of Teague as a remedial limitation 

with this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence.

 It's also difficult to square it with the 

explicit rejection of that notion in American Trucking 

and in Harper and Reynoldsville Casket.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You do recognize, though, 

that one of the propelling forces behind Teague and why 

we changed from the Linkletter regime was respect for 

State courts' processes and the resistance to the heavy 

hand of Federal habeas courts telling States what to do.

 It seems a little ironic then if you take an 

opinion that was driven by the Feds staying out of the 

State courts' territory to say oh, no, we're going to 

tell you that it's not -- we control when we want to.

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, certainly that was 

one of the things that was going on in Teague. But, 

respectfully, I think the question -- it's every bit as 

intrusive on the State process when a State court judge 

applies a new Federal rule to overturn a conviction, as 

it is when a Federal court judge does the same thing.

 In other words, those comity concerns apply 

regardless of forum.

is that the concern in Teague was not only with State 

court processes, but with settled expectations of those 

who are involved in the criminal system, particularly 

victims who are entitled at some point to rely on a 

conviction being final?

 MR. DIAMOND: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We don't usually think of 

just of settled expectations as being questions of 

remedy. We consider those as being questions of 

substance.

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think if you 

look at Justice Harlan's writing in Teague about the 

post-conviction -- what should be the rule for 

post-conviction, you see he lays out very eloquently 

what those concerns are in terms of finality and 

uniformity in the post-conviction arena. And what I'm 

saying is that those concerns -- certainly comity is a 

concern; but those other concerns in terms of finality 

and allocation of judicial scarce criminal justice 

resources and what kind of a trial are you going to have 

11 years after the fact, is it going to be more fair 

than the trial that occurred in the first place, all of 

those -- apply.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- State executives can 

upset all those expectations. The State executive says

I want this -- the issue -- the substantive issue in 

this case settled, so I'm not going to raise Teague. 

And so Crawford is going to be retroactive because I say 

so. It is a bit of an anomaly that the prosecutor has 

that power but not the State court itself.

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, first of all, I 

think the State court is in a business -- is in a 

different role in terms of enforcing the constitutional 

rights in that situation. In fact, as it relates to the 

constitutional right, it is difficult to see what State 

interest a judge should be vindicating at that point.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It is also difficult to 

see what Federal interest is vindicated when the State 

says we know we have to respect this -- call it what you 

want -- new precedent in cases still in the pipeline, 

and we don't have to if the case has reached a final 

judgment. But "not required to" doesn't say "can't, 

even if you want to."

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, that brings me 

back to the point where I started, which is that the 

Constitution doesn't -- remember, we're using the 

Federal Constitution here as authority to do something 

that, for example, in this case the Minnesota Court 

would be otherwise unable to do.

 This defendant never raised the State law

claim. Under -- never had -- this defendant never 

raised his State confrontation rights. So in this 

proceeding, the Minnesota Court would bar him from 

raising his confrontation --

JUSTICE BREYER: Let me take the other point 

here, which is Justice Scalia's, which I think I 

understand now. Imagine that the Crawford begins to 

take effect as of the day of decision. No law like 

Crawford before. But for practical reasons and reasons 

having to do with courts, we let certain people take 

advantage of it. We let person A take advantage of it, 

Mr. Crawford. We let person B take advantage of it, who 

is on direct appeal. We don't let people in habeas take 

advantage of it.

 Why don't we let the State take advantage of 

it in its collateral proceedings if the State wants to, 

for reasons of federalism, for reasons they can do what 

they want, for reasons if it is going to be the law in 

the future any way?

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, my point is that 

the State can take -- the State can do that as a matter 

of State law. The problem is with allowing the State to 

extend the Federal standards here, is that the Federal 

standards under Teague and under Griffith, but mainly 

Griffith and Wharton together in this case, defines what

the constitutional requirement -- what constitutional

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask another sort of 

basic question? The Teague rule is a Federal rule --

the Teague ruling. What is your understanding of the 

source of that rule? Is it the Court's power to 

announce, make Federal common law? Or is it a 

constitutionally mandated rule?

 I will give you one other decision, cover it 

all at once.

 And if it were not a judge-made rule, and 

rather, it was a statute and it goes beyond regulating 

Federal habeas corpus proceedings and effects State 

court proceedings, what provision in the Constitution 

would have given Congress the authority to enact such a 

statute?

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, let me --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Interpreting it the way 

you interpret it.

 MR. DIAMOND: Let me try the first question, 

and then we will see where we go. I think the source 

of -- the authority for Teague is, frankly, the same 

source for authority as it is for Griffith, and as the 

same source of authority as in Griffith. Griffith talks 

about -- the best I can do for that is Griffith talks

about it being grounded on basic norms of constitutional

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which qualifies for the 

Federal system. Where is the authority to regulate the 

State system come from?

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I disagree in 

terms of that that all applies only in the Federal 

system. If you look at, for example, the civil cases, 

American Trucking, Reynoldsville, and Harper, they 

talked about that same basic norms of constitutional 

adjudication applying in the State forum as well.

 I'm sorry. There was a second part to your 

question which was in terms of Congress being able to 

amend or modify Teague in some fashion?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. Where would Congress 

get the authority to require State courts to follow the 

rule, the interpretation of Teague that you're advancing 

in this Court, that they may not go beyond the decisions 

of this Court? What under the Federal Constitution 

authorizes the Federal government, either judges or 

Congress, to tell State courts that they cannot do what 

your opponent argues they should able to do?

JUSTICE STEVENS: I agree when you are 

talking about what Federal court can do -- administering 

a Federal habeas corpus.  I have no problem. I'm asking 

where does the Federal authority to tell State courts 

they cannot do what your opponent says they should be 

free to do?

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I guess my source 

of confusion with your question is I don't understand 

Teague is a rule from Congress. I understand Teague is 

a rule of this Court in terms -- describing what the 

Constitution -- what constitutional standard applies to 

what defendant.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: In Federal habeas corpus 

proceedings, yes.

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, that's where the 

point of agreement is. I think Teague does many things, 

but one of the things Teague does -- and, frankly, not 

just Teague, the whole retroactivity jurisprudence of 

this Court, Griffith and Teague together set up a 

coherent whole. Griffith treats finality. Teague 

post-finality. And the process of this Court saying, 

you this defendant enjoy this substantive Federal right, 

you this defendant enjoy this substantive Federal right 

that was active at the time your conviction became

final --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The protection of this 

Court. What -- why can't they provide more protection? 

What Federal rule prevents that?

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think what --

the problem with it is in the constitutional design 

itself. In terms of the Constitution provides 

requirements. You don't have to get into Teague. 

Griffith and Wharton together, Wharton saying Teague 

exceptions don't apply to Crawford, those two cases 

together basically say the State's requirement to 

provide this new constitutional rule ended when this 

defendant's conviction became final.

 At that point, that is the constitutional 

requirement. The constitutional design then is that 

States are not free as a matter of Federal authority to 

exceed that requirement. They may not rely on Federal 

authority to do that. Just the same -- they can 

certainly do it as a matter of their own authority. But 

the Constitution, for example, this defendant having 

waived his State claims, having not raised them, the 

Constitution doesn't allow the State of Minnesota --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Suppose it is a knock and

fire any officer who does this? Or will they say, no, 

you can't do that, because it goes beyond what the

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think that if 

that remedy is grounded in State laws, the State of 

Minnesota could certainly do that. But I don't think 

they can rely on the Federal Constitution to fire any 

officer who does that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could a -- could a State 

say: We know that Federal habeas, the Fourth Amendment, 

is out. Stone v. Powell says when it's -- when you 

go through the direct process, that's the end of your 

raising a search-and-seizure claim.

 Could a State say: Well, we know the Fourth 

Amendment is binding on us under the Federal 

Constitution, but we think that we should extend the 

Fourth Amendment, right, not only to cases on direct 

review but to collateral review as well?

 Federal habeas courts can't do it, but could 

States?

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think the answer 

to that is probably yes, and the reason is different, 

though. The reason is the States -- we're not changing 

the rights that the person is entitled to.

is -- that is the remedy-and-right question again. And 

-- and what I'm saying is that what Teague -- Griffith 

and Lorton together say that this person's 

constitutional right, the right that he had, was fixed 

when his conviction became final, as opposed to the case 

where you -- that you're postulating, which is the 

question of, yes, the State's going to recognize the 

Fourth Amendment right in its post-conviction -- does 

the right -- the content of the right, itself, is not 

changed in that instance.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Diamond, let me ask you 

a question. Let me ask you a question which is totally 

off the point of the Federal Constitution, I guess. 

That is, if Minnesota really wants the rule that you 

want it to have, its legislature can provide that that 

will be the rule, can't it?

 The Minnesota legislature can pass a statute 

saying nobody gets more than Teague allows.

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I don't think the 

Minnesota legislature could -- could go into the 

pre-finality area. In other words, the Minnesota 

legislature --

legislature say: Look, the -- the Supreme Court of the

won't characterize them as minimums or anything else. 

We'll just say it's a set of rules. It's called Teague, 

and Teague is going to be the law for the application of 

Federal rights in Minnesota State courts. Is -- can the 

Minnesota legislature do that?

 MR. DIAMOND: Your Honor, I think, in that 

instance, the Minnesota legislature -- I see my time is 

up, but I think in that instance the Minnesota 

legislature is -- is providing the minimum that the 

Constitution requires. So the answer to --

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. BUTLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BUTLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 Two quick points in my -- in my one minute:

 On finality, the State court can weigh the 

costs and benefits of upsetting the finality of its own 

conviction, convictions rendered in State court and 

appeals rendered in State court.

 It can decide, as several States have, that

the interests in full adjudication of constitutional 

claims outweigh the interest in finality.

 The question in Teague was whether the 

Federal court could decide that for the States, and the 

answer is no. But the States can decide that for 

themselves.

 On Justice Souter's point about what -- or 

somebody's point about what the source of authority was, 

Mr. Diamond said it was basic norms of constitutional 

adjudication, and that is the phrase used in Griffith.

 That phrase is a minimum. The basic norms 

of constitutional adjudication require the following: 

They require application of new rules to pending cases, 

even though the conduct had already -- had already 

happened.

 They don't require anything more than that, 

and we're not here asking the Court to hold that they 

do. We're simply asking the Court -- I see my time is 

up.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't you finish 

your sentence.

 MR. BUTLER: We are simply asking the Court 

to hold that if the State wishes to go beyond the 

minimum, they are free to do so.

 Thank you.
