 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument next 

in number 04-1371, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith 

versus Dabit.

 Mr. Kasner.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY B. KASNER

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. KASNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

In an effort to limit State-law securities 

class-actions which undermine the market for nationally 

traded securities, Congress enacted SLUSA, a statute of 

broad preemption. SLUSA, which is reprinted at page 8(a) 

of Petitioner's blue brief, preempts, subject to three 

specific statutory extensions, all State-law-covered class 

actions, quote, "by any private party who alleges 

misrepresentations, omissions, or fraudulent behavior in 

connection with the purchase or sale of a covered 

security." The Second Circuit erred in implying an 

exception, that nowhere appears in the statutory language, 

and is wholly at odds with the purpose in the enactment of 

the statute for holders claims, a type of claim in which a 

plaintiff alleges, "I did not purchase" or "I did not 

sell, but would have, had I known the allegedly false

information," a type of claim which this Court, in Blue 

Chip Stamps, over 30 years ago, recognized as the most 

vexatious and abusive type of securities class-action 

claims. 

The court below erred, for a number of different 

reasons. First and foremost, it completely violated the 

natural meaning of the statute. As I have mentioned, an 

examination of SLUSA, beginning at page 8(a), reflects 

that no covered class action may be maintained, quote, "by 

any private party," a clause that this Court, time and 

again, has interpreted as perhaps the broadest way of 

phrasing "any and all private parties" making certain 

types of allegations. Those allegations appear in (a) or 

(b), focusing on the conduct of the defendant in 

connection with the purchase or sale of a covered 

security.

 Now, Congress could have -- had it intended to 

inject a purchaser/seller limitation, consistent with what 

the court below concluded, Congress could have phrased 

that language differently. As the Court is aware, in the 

both the 1933 and 1934 acts, Congress has made express 

causes of action, subject to an explicit purchase or 

seller requirement. For example, section 11 of the '33 

act affords a private right of action to purchasers of 

securities in registered offerings. Section 12 affords a

private right of action to persons from whom an offer or 

sale of securities. Section 9(e) of the '34 act, 

similarly, affords a purchase or seller requirement.

 Significantly, SLUSA nowhere speaks in terms of 

a purchase or sale. And it could have. For example, 

Congress could have provided that no covered class action 

by any private party alleging "his or her sale" of a 

covered security is preempted. It could have said, "Any 

private party alleging a misrepresentation or omission of 

a material fact in connection with the plaintiff or that 

party's purchase or sale." It did not.

 The decision of the court below is also at odds 

with this Court's teaching in United States versus 

O'Hagan, which was decided 1 year before SLUSA was enacted 

by Congress. In United States versus O'Hagan, this Court 

concluded that the so-called "misappropriation theory" 

stated a viable claim in a criminal case brought by the 

United States Government. In responding to an argument by 

the defendant that no one involved that had been defrauded 

purchased or --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask you this 

question about the plain language? If the word in 

1(f)(1)(A) had not been "in connection with the purchase 

of sale -- sale of security," had been "in connection with 

his or her purchase or sale," then it would have been

covered, would it not?

 MR. KASNER: Justice Stevens, if, by "his or 

her," it's referencing "any private party," I would agree 

with that. That would be a different case in --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So, the question is whether we 

should construe the word "the" to be the functional 

equivalent of "his or her."

 MR. KASNER: In essence, Justice Stevens --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that true?

 MR. KASNER: -- that's correct. And I think 

that that question has been answered by this Court, on a 

number of different occasions. Again, in United States 

versus O'Hagan, this Court concluded that the "in 

connection with the purchase or sale of a security" does 

not mean "in connection with the purchase or sale by 

another party to the securities transaction," but, rather, 

means "in connection with the purchase or sale by anyone."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kasner, the -- does the 

Securities and Exchange Commission have enforcement 

authority in this -- in this area?

 MR. KASNER: It does, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Have they issued any rules or 

regulations on this -- on this point?

 MR. KASNER: The point being, Your Honor, 

whether --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: On the point that you're 

arguing, whether the critical language means the person's 

own sale, or not --

MR. KASNER: Yes, Your Honor. In adjudicatory 

proceedings referenced in our brief, the SEC has 

unanimously, and uniformly, taken the position that it 

does not. In briefs to this Court in criminal 

prosecutions, in civil prosecutions, the Government has 

consistently taken the position, as it has in this case, 

as an amicus, and as it did in the court below.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it your position that we owe 

deference to the interpretation of the SEC?

 MR. KASNER: That is our position, Your Honor. 

We do take the position that this Court should defer to 

the views of the SEC on that issue. What that deference 

is, should it be Chevron or Skidmore, is not a question 

Your Honor has asked. I'm happy to say that we believe, 

vis-a-vis 10(b)(5) --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if it's just Skidmore, 

forget about it.

 [Laughter.] 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's --

MR. KASNER: Well, Your Honor, I actually 

carefully studied yesterday's opinion, where this Court 

discussed the Skidmore deference, and, either way, we

think that this is -- the statute is so clear that, 

deference or none, there really is no other way to read 

the language of the statute.

 As I say, this Court, in United States versus 

O'Hagan, concluded squarely that this language does not 

mean the purchase or sale of the plaintiff's securities. 

Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion, joined in by 

Justice Stevens, in the Holmes case makes that same point. 

Significantly, Your Honors, the "in connection with" 

language, as a statutory matter, has consistently been 

construed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and 

by this Court, as one of incredible breadth. Most 

recently, in United States versus Zandford, this Court 

concluded that the "in connection with the purchase or 

sale" language means anything that coincides with a 

securities transaction. And what is significant in this 

case -- it is conceded by the Respondent at page 8 of his 

brief -- that the conduct alleged by the plaintiff below 

is in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. 

There really can be no other conclusion. At myriad 

paragraphs in the pleadings, appearing, among others, at 

joint appendix 53, paragraph 4; joint appendix 53(a), 

paragraph 5; joint appendix 59 to 60 --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kasner, may I just 

interrupt those references to ask you -- one could agree

that, for SEC-enforcement purposes, for prosecutorial 

purposes, the "in connection with" is as broad as you 

suggest. But for purposes of private actions, it isn't 

that broad; it is limited, as this Court said in Blue Chip 

Stamps. It is possible for the same words, even in the 

same statute, in difference contexts, to mean different 

things. 

MR. KASNER: Justice Ginsburg, I believe that 

this Court has answered Your Honor's question in the Blue 

Chip Stamp case, where it specifically rejected that sort 

of an approach, and the one that was consistent with the 

court below. What the Court, in Blue Chip Stamp -- which, 

of course, was a civil case involving an alleged holder's 

claim was a class action -- what this Court said, for 

purposes of a civil proceeding, is, "purchase or seller 

requirement nowhere appears in the statutory language." 

The statute clearly says "in connection with the purchase 

or sale of securities." But, as a statutory matter, this 

Court concluded, Your Honor, that a violation of 10(b)(5) 

had been alleged, notwithstanding going on to conclude 

that the plaintiff could not recover, as a matter of 

private cause of action.

 So, we understand -- we believe, Your Honor, 

that it -- and it is undisputed on this record -- that all 

parties agree, as the court below concluded, that this --

Congress intended to impart 10(b)(5) interpretation as a 

statutory matter into SLUSA. We also think, Justice 

Ginsburg, that, were Your Honors to conclude that somehow 

"in connection with" means something different in a civil 

context, a narrower reading than in the broader context, 

that would, of course, violate, in our view, the rule of 

lenity that is applied by this Court. It would also mark 

what we believe to be the first time, insofar as we have 

been able to determine -- and Respondent cites no 

authority to the contrary -- in which the same provisions 

in a statute that have civil and criminal --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you explain the rule 

of lenity? Because, on criminal, it is as broad as can 

be. I didn't know that there was a rule of lenity that 

applied strictly to civil liability.

 MR. KASNER: Your Honor, we -- and we have cited 

authority, including the Leocal decision of this Court, 

last year, in which, for statutory construction purposes, 

where you have a civil and a criminal statute that has 

both elements to it, the rule of lenity would dictate that 

the narrower reading be the one that is written. So, in 

other words, if this Court were to have concluded, in Blue 

Chip -- excuse me -- in United States versus O'Hagan, 

that, as a criminal matter, the "in connection with" 

language is not tethered to the purchase or sale by a

particular party in the case, that is a broader reading 

than the reading that the court below adopted in a civil 

case. And so, what we're urging is that the rule of 

lenity would suggest that, if this Court, in U.S. v. 

O'Hagan, took the view that the "purchase or sale" 

requirement does not apply in a criminal context, that 

should also apply in a civil context, that a narrower 

reading should not be imparted into a civil context than 

you would find in a criminal context.

 We also --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But one reason you might 

want to adopt a narrower reading, though, is, we're 

dealing here with the preemption provision. It's one 

thing to say that, when you're talking about the SEC's 

enforcement powers, you adopt a broad reading; but it's 

quite another thing, when you're talking about displacing 

State law, that you would necessarily adopt the same broad 

reading.

 MR. KASNER: Mr. Chief Justice, I think, in this 

case, there is no other purpose to be served by this 

statute than to preempt. To the extent that embedded in 

Your Honor's question is a question with respect to the 

so-called presumption against preemption, we don't think 

that those concerns, or the concerns to which Your Honor 

just referred, apply in this case, because the statute is

clear; there is no ambiguity in the language that Congress 

used, and hence -- and it would have made no sense, Mr. 

Chief Justice, for Congress to have --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's a lot of --

I think our cases establish that a phrase like "in 

connection with" carries with it a lot of ambiguity. You 

don't know exactly how rigorous the connection has to be. 

I mean, a auto accident by a broker who's leaving his 

office -- he wouldn't be in the office if he weren't 

buying and selling securities. I mean, is that auto 

accident "in connection with the purchase and sales of 

securities"? No. And yet, you know, theoretically it 

could be. It's a -- there's a lot of ambiguity in 

determining how much breadth to give that phrase.

 MR. KASNER: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I would 

agree with you that, in terms of deciding, for -- as a 

substantive matter, for purposes of 10(b)(5), "in 

connection with," such as in SEC versus Zandford, how far 

the outer reaches of the "in connection with" language go 

may well be susceptible of differences of opinion. There 

is no difference of opinion to which there can be any 

disagreement, in this case, about the plain language of 

the preemption, because the conduct -- no matter what the 

conduct is that is involved "in connection with the 

purchase or sale of securities," one thing that is totally

crystal clear, based on this Court's cases and 

congressional purpose, is that the "in connection with the 

purchase or sale" language, as used here, does not 

restrict its application to the purchase or sale by the 

plaintiff such that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but that's a normal 

reading of the words, wouldn't you -- when you say a 

purchase or -- it normally would be "in connection with 

the purchase or sale of securities by the party to the 

litigation." That would be your first take on it. But 

then you say, "Well, we have cases out there that construe 

it a little more narrowly." And is it not somewhat 

unusual -- and I know it's not totally unusual -- for 

Congress to preempt a State cause of action that without 

-- where there is no parallel Federal remedy.

 MR. KASNER: Justice Stevens, one misimpression 

I believe that the court below was under, and I believe is 

perpetuated by Respondent in his amici, this statute does 

not preempt a State-law claim. This is not like the 

cases, for example --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It just preempts class 

actions.

 MR. KASNER: It preempts class actions. And 

it's significant, because Congress made a policy judgment.

would have preempted all State-law securities cases. All 

of them. As the statute wound its way through the House 

and the Senate, it -- and principally in response to 

testimony by the SEC Commissioner Levitt, who went to the 

Hill three separate times on this legislation -- specific 

statutory exemptions were put in.

 But it -- getting back, though, to the purpose 

behind --

JUSTICE STEVENS: In going through that 

legislative history, did you find any evidence that they 

intended to preempt any State-law claims that were not --

did not have a parallel Federal claim?

 MR. KASNER: Justice Stevens, the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Other than the language of the 

statute?

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- you brought up the 

legislative history.

 MR. KASNER: Yes.

subject.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. KASNER: Your -- Justice Stevens, the only 

reference to the purchaser-or-seller issue is one that is 

referenced by the Respondent. And, in that instance, a 

professor from Cornell, Professor Painter, went to the 

Hill, and he said, "If you enact this statute, you are 

going to be closing off claims of people who are not 

purchasers or sellers, because those cannot be bought in 

the Federal court."

 But back for a moment, though, to the issue of 

what is not preempted in the policy behind this statute, 

there was another component that Congress was seeking to 

remedy here, and that was the so-called "safe harbor." In 

1995, when Congress enacted the Private Securities 

Litigation Reform Act, one piece of that was an effort to 

encourage public companies to make predictive statements 

publicly. There had been a rash of litigation, at the 

time, against public companies whose predictive statements 

proved false. And so, Congress said, "Wait a minute. We 

will allow you an insulation from liability, if your 

forward statements prove false, if the plaintiff cannot 

allege either that they were made with actual knowledge or 

not accompanied by meaningful cautionary language." 

Another purpose of this statute was to --

analysis is that it requires the phrase "in connection 

with" to be given two different and irreconcilable 

interpretations, depending on the identity of the plaintiff. 

Nothing in the text or history of the securities laws 

justifies that implausible interpretation.

 The Securities and Exchange Commission --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hungar, I just wonder if 

that's correct. Is -- am I not right to say that the word 

"the" had been read to mean "his or her," that argument 

would not apply?

 MR. HUNGAR: I think that's correct, Justice 

Stevens, but --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, then you don't have to 

have differing interpretations of "in connection with." 

You just have to know what the word "the" means.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, the "in connection" -- that's 

not the approach that the Court of Appeals took, of 

course, but -- and also, as Mr. Kasner indicated, that 

issue has been dispositively resolved by this Court and 

the Commission in concluding that the purchaser/seller 

rule is not a limitation on the scope of the prohibition 

in section 10(b). And if your interpretation were the one 

that were adopted, that would not be the case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I always thought "the" meant

 [Laughter.] 

MR. HUNGAR: Certainly, that would be our 

submission.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And "his or her" means "his or 

her." 

MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. And, again --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but you --

MR. HUNGAR: -- if it --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- think it means "any."

 MR. HUNGAR: I'm sorry?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think it means 

"any," right? You're reading "the" to mean "any."

 MR. HUNGAR: Right, it's "the" -- well, it's 

"the," in the sense of "the activity of purchasing and 

selling securities," yes. It's -- and that's how this 

Court has interpreted, in the O'Hagan case, for -- if that 

interpretation -- if "the" were read as "his or her," then 

it's impossible to see how the SEC could bring an 

enforcement action, or the Justice Department could bring 

a prosecution, in a case like O'Hagan, where the -- where 

the Court specifically said that the purchaser or seller 

was not defrauded. It's not that -- it's not true that 

section 10(b) requires that the purchaser or seller be

defrauded. And so, we submit that this would be --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it certainly doesn't 

require the Commission to be a purchaser or seller, 

either. You know --

MR. HUNGAR: Well, we certainly would agree with 

that, Your Honor, that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. HUNGAR: But, more generally, it doesn't 

require that there be a purchaser or seller who's 

defrauded, and yet the purchaser/seller rule, for the 

purpose of implied actions, does require that.

 Justice Stevens, you asked about whether there 

is any indication in the legislative history that Congress 

intended this act to preempt class-action claims where 

there would be no Federal remedy. The answer to that is, 

absolutely yes. It is perfectly clear from the 

legislative history that Congress knew, and expected, that 

claims that could be brought under State law as class 

actions, such as aiding-and-abetting claims or negligent-

misrepresentation claims, claims that would not satisfy 

the Federal --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

 MR. HUNGAR: -- scienter requirements for --

and, of course, the claims that would not satisfy the 

requirements of the PSLRA. None of those could be brought

in Federal court, because they're barred by the various 

provisions of Federal law.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but they would be at --

adjudged under a different standard, you're dead right. 

As far as the parties involved, the -- that's what I was 

really asking.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, in cases where the -- where 

the only claim is against aiders and abetters, those 

parties would be -- would be out of court; or, likewise, 

cases where parties could not satisfy the scienter 

requirement, those parties would be out of court. So, 

Congress knew that it would be foreclosing remedies for 

certain categories of claims, and that was part of the 

point of the act, as the conference committee report makes 

clear.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the --

MR. HUNGAR: Congress was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the claim that's made 

here, the second claim, where the broker said, "We lost 

clients, so -- as a result of this deception -- and we 

want to be compensated for that," nothing about the 

inflated price of the security --

MR. HUNGAR: Your --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- just that "our clients 

don't trust us anymore, because we gave them such bad

advice."

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the -- that issue is 

not before this Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I know, but I --

MR. HUNGAR: -- because it was not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- wanted to know what the 

Government's position was on that claim. Could that be 

brought in a State court --

MR. HUNGAR: The --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- even as a class action?

 MR. HUNGAR: The Commission addressed that 

question in its amicus brief in the Court of Appeals, and 

took the position that that claim was not in connection 

with the purchase or sale of securities, because the 

injury occurs after the fraud has been completed, and is -

- and has to do with the lost future relationship, rather 

than fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of 

securities. And so, we didn't address that in our brief 

here, obviously, but the Commission took the position, 

below, that that would not be preempted, because it's not 

in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you deal with the 

Court's -- the footnote in the Blue Chip Stamp -- that 

the court says -- in the Federal court -- "these 10(b) 

actions have to be limited to actual purchasers and

sellers," but that limitation is attenuated, because 

deserving claims by nontraders would lie under State law, 

including the very suit that was involved in Blue Chip 

Stamps and in the Second Circuit case that paved the way 

for Blue Chip?

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, that was an accurate 

description of the state of the law, as it existed at the 

time, at least in theory, although, as a practical matter, 

Respondents have not been able to point to a single 

reported case a -- of a holder class action in State court 

prior to the adoption of the Uniform Standards Act. So, 

while it was true, as a theoretical matter, that such 

claims could be brought under the law of some States, 

there are -- there is no history of State class actions in 

this area, which is one of the reasons why we think the 

reliance on the assumption of nonpreemption makes no sense 

here. Securities class actions prior to the PSLRA were 

brought in Federal court, and it was only the PSLRA that 

resulted in cases, such as the type of case at issue here, 

being brought in State courts. And Congress -- once it 

saw that problem, Congress was concerned that the 

requirements of the PSLRA were being evaded, and it was 

also concerned, as the conference committee report makes 

clear, that, now that these securities class actions were 

being brought in State court, there was the potential

danger of 50 varying State standards being applied, as 

this very case suggests, and Congress acted to remedy both 

of those problems, as the conference committee report 

makes clear, both the risk of nonuniformity in securities 

class actions that are targeted by the act, and the risk 

of evasion of the PSLRA.

 Respondent's position would frustrate both of 

those objectives, because it would -- it would permit the 

most abusive category of lawsuits to proceed in State 

court, and it would permit such holder claims to be 

brought -- for instance, based on negligence, if State law 

permitted that; based on conduct that would be protected 

by the Federal safe harbor for forward-looking statements 

under the PSLRA. So, the PSLRA protections would be 

frustrated by their interpretation.

 So, the very goals that Congress explicitly 

sought to achieve, stated in the -- in the text of the 

statute, in the purposes section and also in the 

conference committee report, would be frustrated. And, 

again, that approach requires the Court to accept an 

inconsistent interpretation of the text of the "in 

connection with" requirement, depending on the identity of 

the plaintiff, which would be an extraordinary way to 

construe a statute, particularly when there's nothing in 

the legislative history that provides even a hint of a

suggestion that Congress would have intended that result.

 And with respect to Blue Chip, Your Honor, it's 

important to remember what Blue Chip was doing. Blue Chip 

was not a case about the scope of the "in connection with" 

requirement or the section 10(b) prohibition. Instead, it 

was a case about what to infer about what Congress would 

have wanted to authorize as an -- as a right of action, if 

it had addressed the question. And that's why the Blue 

Chip court made very clear that the conduct at issue there 

involving injuries to holders can be a violation of 

section 10(b) -- i.e., it can be in connection with the 

purchase or sale of securities -- it's just that they did 

not think that Congress would have wanted to authorize a 

private right of action.

 So, again, when we're talking about the scope of 

the "in connection with" requirement, which is what is at 

issue here, that approach is the same approach that should 

be followed here, the same approach that was in --

followed in O'Hagan and in Zandford, and compels the 

conclusion that, since the conduct at issue here is 

unquestionably "in connection with the purchase and sale 

of securities," as this Court has construed that phrase, 

it is preempted by the Uniform Standards Act.

 If the Court has no further questions, I thank 

the Court.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 Our position is that SLUSA does not preempt 

class actions asserting holder claims. Congress 

incorporated this Court's interpretation of "in connection 

with" from Blue Chip Stamps when it enacted SLUSA. SLUSA 

rechanneled State suits to Federal court. It was not 

designed to eliminate State remedies that could not be 

pursued as Federal 10(b)(5) claims. That interpretation 

is the better reading of the text, the context, and the 

history of SLUSA's handling of private securities actions.

 If I could start with the text --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me, do you agree 

that a holder action falls within 10(b)(5), generally?

 MR. FREDERICK: No, because this Court, in the 

Blue Chip Stamps case, said that it did not. In footnote 

5, Justice Rehnquist --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what about enforcement 

actions taken by the --

MR. FREDERICK: In enforcement --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- SEC?

 MR. FREDERICK: -- actions, the SEC can bring 

enforcement authority, pursuant to 10(b)(5). And so, to 

that extent, misconduct that would be connected to what, 

in a private context, would be deemed a holder claim, does 

fall within the SEC's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then, the --

MR. FREDERICK: -- jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- then it does fall within --

holder actions do fall within 10(b)(5), for some purposes.

 MR. FREDERICK: They do, for enforcement 

purposes; they do not, for private civil-action purposes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, you want us to interpret 

the text two ways, depending on the purpose.

 MR. FREDERICK: No. What I want you to do is to 

understand what Congress intended. And what Congress 

intended, in SLUSA, I think is quite clear if you start at 

the beginning of the statute and you just start reading 

your way through it, because what Congress did in SLUSA 

was attempt to stop a flight of cases that had been 

brought in Federal court heretofore, but were migrating to 

State court, Congress perceived, as a result of the 

enactment of the PSLRA.

 Section 2 of SLUSA -- and it is very important, 

Your Honors, that you look carefully at section 2 of 

SLUSA, because it has five congressional findings. They

are not adequately briefed, or even discussed, by the 

Second Circuit, but one of them says that the PSLRA sought 

to prevent abuses. The second one says, since an 

enactment of that, Congress perceives that a number of 

securities class-action lawsuits have shifted from Federal 

to State courts. The third one says, that shift has 

prevented the act from achieving its objectives. The next 

one says, State securities regulation is of continuing 

importance. And the then, the fifth one says, in order to 

prevent certain State private securities class actions 

alleging fraud from being used to frustrate the objectives 

of the PSLRA, it is appropriate to enact these national 

standards.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The Government doesn't say that 

"all" are covered. The Government acknowledges that there 

are some actions that could still be brought in State 

court.

 MR. FREDERICK: The point, though, Justice 

Scalia, is that what Congress, in the PSLRA, was doing was 

attempting to ratchet up the pleading requirements for 

Federal-law claims.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- it's so 

counterintuitive. As the Government points out, these 

holder claims lend themselves to abuse much more than do 

the narrow purchase-and-sale claims.

 MR. FREDERICK: Absolutely --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And why --

MR. FREDERICK: -- not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- why the Government would 

want to police the one, and let the other, you know, 

proliferate, seems very strange to me.

 MR. FREDERICK: That's not correct, Justice 

Scalia. And it's important to emphasize this. What the 

Court addressed in the Blue Chip Stamps case was a very 

different kind of case. It involved nonpurchasers. And 

the Court reasoned that it would be speculative for 

somebody out there to say, "Well, I would have purchased 

the security, had I known." A holder claim, as recognized 

for a century in various State courts, involves a claim by 

somebody who holds a security and is induced by fraud not 

to sell that security. The restatement set of torts, 

section 525, recognizes that the fraud by forebearance of 

-- to cause you not to take an action is just as much a 

fraud as one that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the --

MR. FREDERICK: -- induces you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the fraud is caused 

-- the fraud causes other people to want to buy the 

security. They do so at a higher price. It causes the 

price to go up. It's "in connection with a purchase or

sale," maybe not of the holder's securities. But it's 

certainly -- the holder's claim wouldn't exist, but for 

purchases and sales that caused the price to go up.

 MR. FREDERICK: In most circumstance, that's 

correct, Mr. Chief Justice. But that, I don't think is 

material. The level of damages that a holder sustains 

should not determine what the elements of the liability 

are. And what is striking about the Government and 

Merrill Lynch's position here is that intentional fraud is 

going to be given a pass because of those persons who are 

uniquely harmed, because, for 20 years --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what your clients 

want to do is cash in on the fraud. They don't -- their 

claim is that they didn't get to sell the stock at an 

inflated price to somebody who didn't know about the 

fraud. That's the damages that they want to collect. And 

that seems to be an odd claim to recognize.

 MR. FREDERICK: That's the same kind of claim 

that in -- to get back to Justice Scalia's question --

arises in the purchaser/seller context. The only 

difference is that the measure of damages is computed by 

when you purchase or sell, as opposed to when you bought 

it, before the fraud occurred. I mean, Wall Street has 

been telling investors, for two or more decades, "Buy and 

hold. Rest your retirement, hold your securities."

And what happened is that the -- some buyers would like to 

bring a fraud suit in Federal court. They have to go to 

Federal court now. They can't go into State court. But 

they have a little brainstorm, or the lawyers do, and they 

say, "Well, in any case where a buyer would have a claim, 

and we don't want to go into Federal court, there surely 

are going to be a class of holders that would also have 

the kind of claim you say." So, there we are, same 

actions, all in the State court, just happens to have 

found a different class of claimant. And there always 

will be such a class.

 MR. FREDERICK: There will be, in most 

circumstances. There are some circumstances where harms 

are unique to holders. But, Justice Breyer, can I point 

out to you that, in the antitrust context, there is, under 

Illinois Brick, a requirement that you must be in the 

direct chain, in a direct purchaser, but there are some 30 

States that have allowed standing for people --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's fine. And I --

MR. FREDERICK: -- that are indirect purchasers.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and what I'm not facing, in 

the antitrust area, is what, it seems to me, on your 

interpretation now, would be, Congress passes a law, which 

becomes a futile act, because what they're anxious is --

to do is to get the cases in the class actions -- not all

the cases -- but the class actions in the Federal court. 

And then, in every single case, or 99.999 percent, where 

we've kept this action out of Federal court, there's going 

to be a comparable action, with holders as the plaintiff, 

in a State court.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what -- that's a -- my 

concern. What do you --

MR. FREDERICK: And let me address that this 

way. What court -- what -- Congress was very clear in the 

legislative debates, was -- it did not want to cut off 

meritorious claims. It simply wanted to rechannel them.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can you -- can you ease my 

concern there? Is there anything you can say that could 

ease my concern that we'll have the same set, that they'll 

just be in State court with a different class?

 MR. FREDERICK: Many States doesn't recognize 

holder claims as a matter of State law, and they have the 

same kinds of heightened pleading requirements that were 

imposed under the PSLRA.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And, by the way, my concern is 

not that it's a "bad thing," in quotes. My concern is 

that it's hard for me to think Congress would have done 

something that wouldn't have had much effect.

a type of claim that this Court had said could not be 

brought under --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then --

MR. FREDERICK: -- Federal law.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- what do you make of the 

legislative history? I mean, your friend on the other 

side pointed out that there was very clear testimony to 

the effect that if the statute passed, with the text that 

we're dealing with, that it would, indeed, cut out a 

series of claims.

 MR. FREDERICK: I don't think that that was --

if you read that in context, I don't think that it was a 

statement by the speaker, in that instance, of Congress's 

intent to go beyond those claims that were cognizable 

under Federal law, and to cut off a whole category of 

claims that were unique to State law.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, you mentioned 

cutting off a whole category of claims. And, earlier, you 

said they didn't want to give a pass to this kind of a

claim. But this is not a pass, because there are all 

sorts of remedies retained -- derivative suits, 49-person 

actions, and so forth. And are you aware -- you mentioned 

the 100 years of State precedent -- is there any precedent 

in the State law for class actions for holder claims?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, we think the Weinberger 

case recognized that class actions could be brought, under 

New York law. It was a Federal case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But this --

MR. FREDERICK: -- but it was --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- is not a case where we have 

a 100-year body of law of class action after class action 

brought on State-law grounds for this type of claim.

 MR. FREDERICK: True. But, in the '90s, you had 

a unique form of fraud that was being perpetrated on Wall 

Street that did affect holders in a unique way. And we've 

highlighted market timing in our briefs. In that 

circumstance, it would be futile for 49 holders to get 

together and assert that they had been harmed by market 

timing, because the aggregate of their harm is so small 

that you really have to look at it in a large context. 

John Vogel, the head of Vanguard for many years, 

and one of most respected mutual-fund advisors, says that 

there are as many as $5 billion lost by people who buy and 

hold, as we've been taught to do by Wall Street, but whose

aggregate losses accrete every year by virtue of market 

timing. That is a unique harm caused to holders, which, 

under their theory, would not be cognizable, because it 

would be preempted, and it would be impossible, as a 

practical matter, for someone to get together with 48 of 

his or her fellow victims and try to bring a claim to 

redress that. There's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you're --

MR. FREDERICK: -- no evidence --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- you're describing the 

present importance of the -- that. But I don't think 

you've answered my question about historic -- as a matter 

of history, we don't have a history of timer claims.

 MR. FREDERICK: We don't have a history of timer 

claims, but what we also don't have, Justice Stevens, is 

an indication by Congress, throughout the entire 

legislative debate or the conference reports or anything, 

where holder claims which had been brought were perceived 

to be a problem and were perceived to be within the ambit 

of what Congress was doing. Because, remember --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, because they -- I mean, the 

argument made by the Government: "Of course not, because 

the only reason they're brought is precisely to evade this 

congressional legislation." They didn't exist, before; 

and they've become common, afterwards. Now -- you know, I

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that they --

MR. FREDERICK: -- they could not be brought 

under Federal law, before. And I would acknowledge that, 

because of a series of this Court's decisions, it is 

easier to prove a purchaser/seller claim, where the facts 

warrant that, under 10(b) prior to the PSLRA than it was 

to prove a holder claim. Judge Friendly, in the 

Weinberger opinion, makes very clear that the value to be 

attributed to the class-action settlement there has to be 

diminished because of the difficulty of proof of such 

claims. But that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that there were --

well, never mind. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: There would --

that the Government makes about how this would supposedly 

affect the SEC's enforcement authority --

tightening the requirements for class actions, but then 

there is this class, which -- Blue Chip did say there's a

lot -- room for a lot of abuse in holder classes -- would 

be left to the State courts for whatever strict or lenient 

rules. So, why would Congress, with respect to this 

category, want there to be a more plaintiff-friendly rule 

than the rule that Congress has just put in place for the 

purchaser/seller 10(b) actions?

 MR. FREDERICK: Justice Ginsburg, I don't think 

that it's correct to characterize it as more plaintiff-

friendly. If you're in Minnesota, you can't bring one of 

these claims, because State law doesn't recognize it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, at least in some 

States.

 MR. FREDERICK: In some States, you -- where the 

common law or the State statutes recognize these claims, 

all that we're arguing is that Congress didn't focus on 

these. In the normal presumption against preemption, you 

don't, you know, cut through a wide swath of claims where 

Congress hasn't expressed an intent specifically to 

preempt them. That's our position, and particularly where 

the congressional findings --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you're admitting 

that an -- that anomaly could be part of the scene, that 

you'd have a State that allows you to sue for negligence, 

and doesn't have heightened pleading requirements for 

holder claims; and so, those claims would be treated more

-- in a more plaintiff-friendly way than Federal claims.

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. Certainly, just as "breach 

of fiduciary duty" and "breach of the covenant of good 

faith and fair dealing" are State-law claims, negligence 

is a State-law claim, all of those give rise to 

variations, State by State. But what Congress was getting 

at were fraud claims that were Federal-law fraud claims. 

And, when it did so, it was heightening the pleading 

requirements and, seeing what people were doing was taking 

what were Federal-law claims and migrating them to State 

court under, ostensibly, more lenient standards --

JUSTICE BREYER: But why, in your theory --

suppose you're right. You're right. I assume that. 

You can have these holder claims. But why couldn't 

any buyer, who's -- has to go to Federal court because he 

has a buyer claim, just say, "I'll bring the holder claim"?

 MR. FREDERICK: He can't do that under the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Because?

 MR. FREDERICK: -- under the Second Circuit's 

test, because --

JUSTICE BREYER: I know. But what I'm asking 

is, What's the logic of that? I mean, you're either right 

or you're wrong. If Congress didn't want to cut off the 

holder claim, they didn't. So, what's to show that they 

wanted to cut it off for some people, but not other

people?

 MR. FREDERICK: The logic is that, for the 

buyers of those claims, they are meeting the Federal 

standard of "in connection with" --

JUSTICE BREYER: Not in this suit.

 MR. FREDERICK: -- "purchase or sale."

 JUSTICE BREYER: Not --

MR. FREDERICK: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- in this suit.

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes, they are, because they're 

buying -- the reason why these people have -- under the 

Second Circuit's standard, which we think is correct, is 

that you had to have bought the stock before the fraud, 

and you were holding it throughout that period of fraud; 

and so, your purchase is not "in connection with" the 

fraud, the misrepresentation. But somebody who sees the 

prospectus, who sees what Mr. Blodget was saying, which 

was that there were stocks that were, quote, "a piece of 

crap," but they were giving them the highest buy 

recommendation -- those people are making their purchase 

"in connection with" --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, if I'm both --

MR. FREDERICK: -- "a fraud."

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- I bought it in May, in 

reliance on this ridiculous thing. "Buggy whips make

gold." I believed it. I bought buggy whips. Now --

we're now in December. And every month, they kept 

repeating it. And my claim is, "Yes, I know, I bought it 

in May, in reliance, but I kept it in July, because I kept 

seeing it repeated and repeated." Do I --

MR. FREDERICK: I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- have a claim?

 MR. FREDERICK: I think, actually under the 

Second Circuit's standard, that --

JUSTICE BREYER: In the Second Circuit, I do 

not. But I want to know why not.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I think that the reason 

why not is that if the fraud is affecting the plaintiff's 

decision to purchase, then that falls within SLUSA, and 

that is preempted, although it allow -- you are allowed to 

have a Federal remedy under that standard. You're 

rechanneled to Federal court. But if you buy -- to use 

your hypothetical, you buy in January, but the fraudulent 

misrepresentations are not made until May or June, you're 

precluded from bringing a Federal-law claim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if I choose not to 

complain about my buying, I just choose to complain about 

my holding? It's true, I was harmed because I jumped in. 

And that's one harm. But it's an entirely separate harm 

that I was induced to hold it --

March, April, and May. I bought, in January, also in 

reliance on fraud, but I'm not complaining about that."

 MR. FREDERICK: What the Second Circuit said, 

which I think is correct, is that -- is that your damages 

have to be totally and apart from the fraud as a 

purchaser, and that where --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But they are --

MR. FREDERICK: -- the reason why they set this 

timeframe for holder claims is that those kinds of claims 

that you're talking about, Justice Scalia, would be a 

classic purchaser/seller-type claim, and you can bring 

that in Federal court. And that's the point here, that, 

where you've got long-term holders, and you've got people 

who purchased in the '80s or in the '70s, and they're being 

induced to hold for decades, and they may want to make --

they may suffer their damages as a result of collateral 

that they want to borrow against -- they have no practical 

means of recovery --

JUSTICE SCALIA: As a practical matter, my 

damages from the holding may be much greater than my 

damages from the initial purchase. And you're saying, 

"Tough luck, Charlie. You bought a month too soon -- or a 

month too late. You should have brought -- bought before 

the fraud."

which I think is correct, is that that becomes a level of 

line-drawing that we don't think Congress did intend to 

get into.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you. But that's 

the trouble. Because, in order to make the Second 

Circuit's argument, you have to say the following, 

"Congress couldn't have intended to allow people who have 

a buyer claim to make a totally separate holder claim, 

because that would gut the statute, and they wouldn't want 

to engage in a futile act." But now you're asking us to 

do about the same thing, when you talk about a person who 

doesn't have the buyer claim and you're trying to get us 

to say, "Congress thought -- Congress thought an 

individual action there, their own separate action in the 

State court, wasn't good enough; it would have wanted to 

preserve the holder claim for them." Now, that's 

possible, but it requires me to think Congress is going 

through quite a few hoops here.

 MR. FREDERICK: The hoops that Congress went to, 

and which I have articulated, in the congressional 

findings, are that the particular harm that Congress was 

addressing in SLUSA -- this was a narrow -- you know, this 

was a narrowly framed preemption as to Federal-law claims, 

because a -- the PSLRA only governed Federal-law claims. 

And if you could not bring a holder claim under Federal

law, because of Blue Chip Stamps, you were forced into 

State court. Okay? So, when Congress is debating the 

evasion of the PSLRA, it is only talking about Federal-law 

claims. And there's nothing in the legislative history 

that they've cited, or that we have found, to suggest that 

Congress gave any thought to preempting a class of holder 

claims. Now, certainly --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, can I ask sort 

of a background question? Ever since Blue Chip -- it's 

been on the books for a long time -- has Congress ever 

considered legislation that would expand the 10(b)(5) 

private remedy to include holder claims?

 MR. FREDERICK: I'm not aware of legislation, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not, either. I -- just 

wondering if there was some we could --

MR. FREDERICK: But what -- what this Court did 

say, in Blue Chip Stamps, was that, when the Birnbaum 

decision -- and it was an interpretation of "in connection 

with purchase or sale" by what one Justice on this Court 

described as the "Mother Court of the Court of Appeals" --

it was Chief Judge Swan, Judge Augustus Hand, and Judge 

Learned Hand -- and they construed the words "in 

connection with purchase or sale" to mean the plaintiff's 

purchase --

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- but Blue Chip did not adopt 

the rationale of the Birnbaum case.

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, I think it -- it did adopt 

the rule, though, as a basis of the wording. And if you 

look at page 733 of the Court's opinion, it was adopting 

the rationale, in the sense that it saw Birnbaum as a 

construction of the language, and it adopted that. And 

then in note 5, when Justice Rehnquist's opinion says, "It 

would be odd to read 'in connection with purchase or sale' 

to give a," quote, "'cause of action to everybody in the 

world,'" I think it's clear that that was suggesting that 

State law could recognize something that this Court said 

was not recognized under Federal law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Frederick, it seems to me 

that the language "in connection with," you know, whether 

it means what Blue Chip meant or whether it means what the 

statute meant, is at least ambiguous. And, if that's the 

case, why shouldn't we be guided by the Securities and 

Exchange Commission's determination, under Chevron, Mead, 

you know, anything but --

MR. FREDERICK: This statute is a -- about 

private civil actions, and it doesn't affect the SEC's 

enforcement authority or any action. In fact, the SEC

JUSTICE SCALIA: Have we not given any weight to 

SEC determinations, as to its interpretation, where civil 

actions are involved? I'm surprised at that.

 MR. FREDERICK: This is an act, Justice Scalia, 

where the SEC's enforcement authority isn't affected one 

jot. And so, I think it would be a strange application of 

Chevron, or even Skidmore, deference to say that the SEC 

gets some special weight because it's construing words in 

an enactment --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. FREDERICK: -- that's addressed to private --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you know --

MR. FREDERICK: -- civil litigation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- whether the SEC filed an 

amicus brief in Blue Chip?

 MR. FREDERICK: Yes. And it took the position 

there that "in connection with" did have a broad 

construction. And that position was rejected.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It took the position that the 

Seventh Circuit took in Eason, didn't it?

deference to the SEC's position, because it was an implied 

private right of action that this Court had recognized, 

and that the lower courts had recognized.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you finish -- there's 

two questions I would like to ask him. One is -- we know 

about the holder claims. They are saved for State 

actions. They're not preempted. What else would fall in 

this category that is not -- that SLUSA doesn't affect, 

that can be brought as class actions in State court?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, there are class actions 

that concern breaches of fiduciary duty, negligence. And 

the question of whether or not they are "in connection 

with purchase or sale" is going to have a profound impact 

on whether or not those claims are also preempted. I 

can't spell out for you what the necessary consequences 

are, but there are a lot of State-law claims brought under 

Blue Sky laws and other State remedies that traditionally 

have been observed and brought, even as State claims, but, 

under a -- you know, the all-encompassing parameter of "in 

connection with purchase or sale" advanced on the other

side, a decision that would favor that could have unknown

contrary to the normal way you would put Congress to the 

test of determining, "Did it intend to preempt those 

claims?" before adopting a broad interpretation that would 

do so. And if I could point out --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You --

MR. FREDERICK: -- one of the strange things 

about this case and the SEC's position is that district 

courts are going to be put in the rather unusual position 

of paying a rather high cost, because if they are 

confronted with a removal of a case brought under State 

law, where the defendant asserts that it is preempted 

under SLUSA, and the SEC hasn't taken any action at all, 

and has expressed no interest in this particular area, the 

district court, to determine preemption, has to intuit 

whether or not this is within the SEC's enforcement 

authority. So, you have -- ordinarily, you would have 

private plaintiffs suing for wrongdoing on the same side 

of the case as the SEC, as the public enforcer. But, 

here, you have them at loggerheads. And the only way that 

the district court can properly figure that out, whether 

or not the private victim can get a private remedy, is to 

cut back on the SEC's enforcement authority, will -- if 

you will -- would exact an awfully high cost.

 I would submit that that kind of an anomaly is a 

rather unusual one, particularly where the SEC isn't a 

party in the case, and it is not being invited to submit a 

brief. And yet, district courts, in order to determine 

the preemption question here, are going to have to rule 

against the SEC in order to give a private remedy -- to 

recognize a private remedy under State law, or to cut back 

on a remedy under State law by holding that it is within 

the SEC's enforcement jurisdiction.

 Ultimately, what Merrill Lynch here is asserting 

is an immunity for a fraud that uniquely affects a certain 

class of holders who do not have a remedy under Federal 

law. And I would submit that, where any party is seeking 

to get an immunity from an intentional fraud, the party 

bears a heavy presumption that that is, in fact, what 

Congress intended. And I would submit to you that, both 

with the language of the statute, the findings that 

Congress made in the legislative history, Congress did not 

express an intent to eliminate holder class actions of 

greater than 49 persons.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I agree with that presumption 

against preemption, where the question is, Does this 

Federal statute, which says nothing about preemption, 

accidentally preempt some State law? -- that there, the 

presumption makes sense. But here, you have a statute,

the whole object of which is preemption. And I'm not sure 

that what you shouldn't do in that case is just give the 

language its most reasonable meaning, with no thumb on 

either side of the scale. 

MR. FREDERICK: But it's preemption to 

rechannel. And that's the important point, Justice 

Scalia. The point was not to allow State-law claims under 

State-court systems, but to rechannel those actions into 

Federal court. And if there are a category of victims of 

frauds who have no Federal remedy, it doesn't make sense 

to infer that Congress, without saying so, left those 

people without any remedy whatsoever.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, I want to be 

sure of one question. I'm not sure I understood your 

argument about how the district court has to deny the 

right to the SEC. But the SEC wouldn't be bound by the 

district court's decision, would it?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, it depends on how the 

courts would construe the SLUSA cases as affecting the "in 

connection with purchase or sale" in the SEC enforcement 

authority. If you were to accept the premise that the 

Court's Zandford and O'Hagan decisions are binding on the 

SLUSA preemption language, anytime a court is construing --

May I finish, Mr. Chief Justice?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly.

 MR. FREDERICK: Anytime a court is construing 

that language, in the SLUSA context, it would necessarily 

have a collateral impact on the SEC's enforcement 

authority in 10(b).

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but the SEC could 

relitigate it, I would think. It wouldn't be bound by the 

judgment in a private suit.

 MR. FREDERICK: It could certainly relitigate 

it. But the point of the persuasive authority of a 

construction of "in connection with purchase or sale," I 

think, would have effects that are inappropriate.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel.

 MR. FREDERICK: Thank you.

minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAY B. KASNER

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. KASNER: Counsel referred to the findings in 

the legislation. And I know this Court will go back and 

review those. The -- finding number 5 does not use the 

word "certain" anywhere in it. What finding number 5 does 

say, however, "It is appropriate to enact national 

standards for securities class-action lawsuits involving 

nationally traded securities while preserving the 

appropriate enforcement powers of State securities

regulators and not changing the current treatment of 

individual lawsuits," quote/unquote.

 Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg asked 

questions that I think illustrate that Congress could not 

have intended such an anomalous result by allowing 

holders' claims to proceed as nonpreempted.

 Justice Breyer, as a practical matter, you are 

100 percent right in the premise of your question. If 

this Court agrees with -- that the court below is correct, 

every single securities class action that is brought in 

Federal court from that day forward will have a companion 

claim brought with it, asserted by holders. And it's not 

simply holders in the fashion that Mr. Dabit appears, 

which is somebody who claims, "I would have sold, had I, 

essentially, known inside information," a proposition 

which Judge Friendly expounded on in the Levine case in 

the Second Circuit, but you will also have holders -- you 

will also have claims by people who come to court, in the 

State court, and say, "You know, I would have bought 

securities if you had not issued such unduly pessimistic 

projections," just as was the case in the Blue Chip Stamp 

case. And imagine the impact that that result would have 

on the safe harbor, which Congress enacted with the PSLRA 

to protect public companies in the United States and 

abroad, encouraging them to make forward-looking

statements. If you allow a result which affords putative 

people, who would have bought and would have sold, in 

State court where the safe harbor doesn't apply, you will 

absolutely be gutting the statutory protections that 

Congress was seeking to protect.

 I'd like to just make one point about the 

Weinberger verse -- the Weinberger v. Kendrick case that 

is mentioned. That involved an approval of a Federal-

court class action where State-law holders' claims were 

being released. In fact, the consideration that was 

approved there was less, because the claims were weaker.

 We've heard a lot, Your Honors, about why 

Congress didn't mention holders' claims by name. The 

reason they didn't mention holders' claims by name is that 

it wasn't until SLUSA was enacted and creative plaintiff 

strike-suit lawyers brought holders' claims, in an effort 

to avoid SLUSA, that this problem became exacerbated. But 

there is no doubt that the plain and natural meaning of 

SLUSA picks up all claims by any private party in 

connection with the purchase or sale of security.

 If there are no --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's surprising that the 

holder claims didn't respond to Blue Chip. I think your 

argument would suggest they should have responded to Blue 

Chip by bringing a whole host of holder claims in the
