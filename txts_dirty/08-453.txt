 CHIEF JUDGE ROBERTS: We will hear argument

Association.

 Ms. Underwood.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 Under the OCC regulation at issue here, 

State antidiscrimination and consumer protection laws 

can be enforced against national banks by the Federal 

OCC and by private parties, but not by State attorneys 

general. This unusual enforcement pre-emption, which 

detaches the State's power to make laws from its power 

to enforce them, was not written into the National Bank 

Act by Congress in 1864, and it's implausible that 

Congress implicitly delegated to OCC the power to read 

it in now.

 We know the NBA did not in 1864 enact 

enforcement pre-emption against the States for three 

reasons: First, the words of the statute; second, a 

long line of cases from this Court, especially St. 

Louis, upholding the power of the State to enforce laws

against a national bank or rejecting it on the ground 

that the law was substantively pre-empted, but not 

questioning the power of the State to enforce a valid 

law; and, finally, the wholly anomalous character, 

foreign really to our structure of government, of 

separating the power to make law from the power to 

enforce it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But to some extent, would 

you concede that interpretation; that is, not only the 

attorney general under New York's law, but the 

superintendent of banks as well, has authority over 

mortgage lending? Would -- would you agree that the 

part about the bank superintendent's enforcement could 

not be enforced against national banks?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, first of all, the bank 

superintendent in New York doesn't have authority over 

national banks. It has authority only over State banks, 

as we pointed out in our reply brief. So we don't 

assert that authority.

 I would say that the -- and the injunction 

doesn't run -- that's at issue in this case, doesn't run 

against the superintendent. It runs against the 

attorney general. But I would say --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is -- the 

provision that you are talking about, 296(a), concerns

the authority of the bank superintendent as well as the 

authority of the attorney general; isn't that so?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: I believe that the banking 

superintendent does not assert authority to enforce in a 

regulatory fashion against national banks. If they did, 

if -- if -- if the bank superintendent asserted a 

chartering or licensing supervisory regime, that would 

be a different issue from the question --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Just with respect to the 

same issue on mortgage lending where there's a concern 

about racial discrimination?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, the -- the bank -- the 

banking superintendent of New York does not enforce 

against national banks.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Anything? And you agree 

to that?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes, that is right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even if the New York 

statute --

MS. UNDERWOOD: Read differently or 

interpreted or applied differently.

 What's at issue here is a distinction 

between a supervisory regime -- "visitation" is a regime 

characterized by routine examinations, no cause needed, 

by a chartering or a licensing authority for the purpose

of enforcing limitations on --

JUSTICE BREYER: How is it supposed to work? 

This is what is bothering me at the heart of this case. 

I imagine that banks, particularly right in these last 

few months, are in situations where there are three 

categories of -- of borrowers. One might be a category 

of people whom you are reasonably confident in, and the 

second is a category of people who are borderline or 

less so, and there are also minorities.

 Now, where you make the decision as a bank 

to deny them the loan, it sometimes is difficult to say 

whether that decision was made for a discriminatory 

reason, namely race, or for a legitimate reason, namely 

because this was a person unlikely to pay the money 

back.

 Now, how is a bank to function if 50 

different attorneys general plus the Federal agencies 

all look at the books of the bank to look at the 

individual loan and to make that kind of determination 

about which quite honestly reasonable people will often 

differ?

 And how -- how is that really a problem, or 

am I just creating that? And if it's really a problem, 

how in your opinion does the Federal law deal with that 

problem, if not in the way that your opponent suggests?

MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, an -- there is a 

single standard of discrimination. It is the case that 

the -- that the Federal standards applied by the OCC and 

the State law all look to Title VII law about a prima 

facie case being --

JUSTICE BREYER: If I may say so, that 

response overlooks the question. I don't doubt the 

single standard. What I do doubt is in the -- in the 

category of uncertain cases, that 51 different 

individuals, 50 State attorneys general plus one Federal 

individual, will reach the same result.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: These are hard and, 

therefore, they will reach a lot of different results 

under the same standard.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: There has been no such 

multiplicity of -- of enforcement. In fact, there is so 

much antidiscrimination work to go around that having 

multiple enforcers is a device for --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So you deny the 

hypothetical. You are saying that my analysis of the 

problem is wrong; there simply is no such problem, and 

since there is no such problem, it doesn't matter if 

everyone enforces it.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: It is already the case that

under the Fair Housing Act, HUD is required to refer --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is your answer yes or no to 

what I just said, that you deny that the statement of 

the problem is realistic and therefore there is no 

problem in your view about having 51 different people 

enforce the same standard.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: There is no record of any 

such problem. And should such a -- yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And should such a problem 

arise, what?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Should such a problem arise, 

that would be an occasion for considering a kind of 

burden pre-emption that would be similar -- on evidence 

of such a problem, that might be a basis for OCC to make 

a record and enact a regulation to deal with that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if OCC thought there 

might be such a problem, couldn't it act in advance to 

avoid the risk that Justice Breyer's question explains?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, its regulation doesn't 

say that. The injunction that was issued in this case 

doesn't say that. What the regulation, the rulemaking, 

and the injunction all rest on is a legal analysis, not 

an empirical one.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May we clarify one thing 

about the 50 jurisdictions? The attorney general from

New York is not asserting authority over bank lending in 

Hawaii. So for each institution, I assume it's going to 

be two sovereigns, the OCC and the State attorney 

general, not 50 descending on the single -- single bank 

with respect to particular loans?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: That's correct. And the 

OCC --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's correct 

with respect to a particular loan. It's not respect --

with respect to Federal policy about national banks 

around the country. It's conceivable and I suppose 

likely that the Federal regulator would want the same 

rule to apply to banks in Michigan as to banks in 

Hawaii.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: It is. But if the question 

was would the -- would the actual act of responding to a 

complaint or to discovery burden particular people 

because there would be 50 people asking for the same 

information, that's not the case, because the loans made 

in New York would be analyzed by a New York enforcer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I want to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. The same rule 

would not apply in Michigan and Hawaii, anyway, even 

under the Federal Government. The Federal Government 

acknowledges that Michigan can have its own law --

MS. UNDERWOOD: The Federal Government --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and Hawaii can have a 

different law. All the Federal Government is arguing 

is: We want to be the ones to enforce the separate 

Michigan law and the separate Hawaii law, right?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: That appears to be the case. 

In fact, they have acknowledged that the State law 

actually applies. It's undisputed. OCC said so in its 

complaint. Congress has several times said so, which is 

presumably why the OCC says so -- said so in the Fair 

Housing Act savings clause, in the -- in the Equal 

Credit Opportunity Act savings clause, and in 

Riegle-Neal, which specifically applies only to national 

bank branches, but expressly preserves the application 

of State fair lending and consumer protection laws.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You are just at the point 

of getting to what I -- the blank in my mind. And the 

blank in my mind is when you said, but if there were 

such a problem, as I had described, but if there were, 

then they could -- and now that's the blank. Then they 

could what?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, there are many things 

that they might do.

 JUSTICE BREYER: For example, just give me 

two, a couple.

MS. UNDERWOOD: For example, make some 

provision for -- in fact, I believe there are some 

regulations that call for conferencing and collaboration 

and consultation among the State enforcers and between 

the State and Federal regulators to avoid duplicative 

regulation. There is already the potential with respect 

to State banks that are supervised both by State 

regulators and by the FDIC. There are alternate audits 

in alternate years. I mean, there -- there is plenty of 

precedent in bank regulation for mechanisms for 

consultation and collaboration so that people don't step 

on each other's toes.

 And in Federal criminal enforcement, for 

example, there are -- there are many -- many occasions 

where there is both Federal and State authority to 

enforce. And the result of that tends to be to get more 

extensive, fuller enforcement. People don't tend to 

both bring the same case. If somebody is enforcing 

something, somebody -- a different enforcer will attack 

a different problem.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- in the -- in the 

general -- in the field of criminal enforcement 

generally there isn't any provision comparable to what 

is now 36(f)(1)(B), at least to my knowledge, and it's 

set out on pages 46 and 47, the text is in the

government's brief: "The provisions of any State law to 

which a branch of a national bank is subject under this 

paragraph shall be enforced with respect to such branch 

by the OCC."

 And that mandate, it "shall be enforced with 

respect to such branch" sounds pretty exclusive to me.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You can't tell for sure. 

But why would -- why would Congress, number one, if 

it -- if Congress simply assumed that there would be 

a -- a dual system of enforcement, that OCC could --

could say to the bank, you follow State law, and if you 

don't, we are going to go after you administratively, 

and leaving it to the State to go after, in any other 

fashion, what State law provided. If that was 

Congress's assumption, why would it have -- have passed 

this seeming mandate, "shall be enforced with respect to 

such branch" by the -- by the OCC?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: There are two reasons for 

that provision. The purpose of that provision was to 

confirm that OCC didn't lose its pre-existing 

enforcement power when Riegle-Neal stated -- that's (1) 

(B) -- in (1)(A) that national branches would be treated 

more or less like State branches for purposes of 

consumer protection and fair lending.

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that -- that's, in 

effect, saving clause kind of function could have been 

performed simply by a statute that says OCC may. And 

this says it shall be enforced by OCC.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: There is another reason in 

the legislative history, which makes it clear that it 

was a directive to OCC to mount an enforcement program 

which Congress thought it had not been doing. We know 

that because in the conference report and other 

legislative history Congress says it's trying to expand, 

not contract, the enforcement of fair lending and 

consumer protection laws, and that the law isn't taking 

any authority away from the States and that they are 

distressed at the inadequate failure of OCC to exercise 

its enforcement authority.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't deny, do you, 

that the Federal Government can, if it wishes, enforce 

the State laws?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So this provision isn't 

really contrary to what you are saying. You are just 

saying the State can do it as well?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: That's correct. It isn't 

talking -- it doesn't say anything about exclusive 

authority, and it isn't talking about judicial

enforcement, which OCC doesn't do. It is talking about 

it's -- it has a savings clause kind of function and 

it -- it's hortatory, it's directing OCC to exercise the 

authority that it has.

 It seems to be common ground that it didn't 

give OCC any new power, because it would be odd to give 

OCC different power over the branches -- this only 

applies to the branches -- different power to the 

branches than over the branches than over the banks, 

different, more extensive power over consumer protection 

and fair lending than other kinds of bank enforcement. 

This was a provision dealing with branches and consumer 

protection and fair lending that said to OCC: You still 

have that authority and you should exercise it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we come to the New 

York Attorney General. I see your argument that there's 

a certain incongruity between saying private attorneys 

general okay, but no public attorney general. But on 

the other hand, the attorney general starts out by 

asking for bank books and records. And high on the list 

of visitorial powers is the authority to demand the 

bank's books and records.

 So why isn't that -- his preliminary 

investigation at least, why doesn't that fit within the 

visitorial power bundle?

MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, because you can look 

at books and records under various authorities. Books 

and -- you can look at books and records under your 

visitorial authority, if you are the supervisor and have 

the relationship to the bank that a licensing or 

chartering authority has and you are looking at them for 

no particular cause. Or you can look at books and 

records if you have a civil suit against the bank and 

you are engaging in discovery that is -- or for that 

matter a criminal prosecution against the bank, and 

ancillary to that discovery is required; or in Guthrie, 

the inquiry -- the looking at books and records was 

pursuant to a statutory authority for shareholders to 

look at books and records.

 So the simple fact of a physical act of 

looking -- or a legal act of looking at books and 

records doesn't tell you whether visitorial authority is 

being exercised. Visitorial authority has long been 

understood as a whole regime of oversight. Watters 

involved a visitorial regime that was ancillary to 

licensing. The earlier visitorial regimes that were 

referenced in the old treatise tended to involve 

visitorial regimes that were established ancillary to 

chartering, back when corporate charters had limited 

purposes, the way banks do still, but most corporate

charters, most corporate certificates of incorporation 

don't anymore.

 So the fact that books and records are being 

examined is neither here nor there on the question 

whether the visitorial power that is referenced in 484 

is -- is being exercised.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There is an historic 

reason for thinking that Congress would be more 

concerned about States exercising visitorial powers than 

they would be about private attorneys general or private 

lawyers. This goes back to McCulloch v. Maryland. 

National banks were always targeted by the States. They 

weren't typically targeted by private attorneys. So 

that incongruity doesn't strike me as terribly 

significant.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, the suggestion is made 

that 484, and there is some historical basis for it, was 

-- was meant to protect national banks against --

against, hostile States, which I guess is what you are 

suggesting, rather than hostile private people. But 

actually what it was meant to do was assign 

responsibility for the supervision of these new 

entities -- there hadn't been banks like this, private 

banks which were nevertheless federally chartered. 

Before that there was the National Bank that was at

issue in McCulloch v Maryland, and to exclude the States 

from asserting the authority to do audits, to do regular 

banking examinations, which actually one senator had 

proposed the States be permitted to do and that was 

rejected.

 I would say the concern about State 

hostility was apparently much reduced by 1869, not much 

after this statute was passed, when this Court in 

National Bank v. Kentucky upheld the power of the States 

not just to tax shareholders on their shares, but to 

require the national banks to help, to require the 

national banks to pay the tax that was due from those 

shareholders in order to assist in collection. And the 

Court -- McCulloch was cited to the Court and the Court 

said it saw no possibility here, unlike in McCulloch, 

that the State would somehow use its authority in this 

way to incapacitate the banks or impair them by 

eliciting their help to collect a valid tax.

 There actually had been some thought when 

the national banks were first created that they would, 

in the marketplace, drive State banks out of existence, 

but they didn't. And the story has been one 

legislatively of maintaining competitive equality 

between them, not of hostility. So --

a little bit about Chevron?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Whatever the 

arguments may be on the merits, it's not clear to me 

that visitorial powers has an unambiguous meaning that 

would pre-empt the authority of the OCC to explain it to 

us.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I'd say two thing 

about that. 484 may have some ambiguity about it. I 

think it is not ambiguous as to the matters covered by 

this regulation. Visitorials have -- visitorial powers 

have never been understood to include discrete acts of 

law enforcement by a jurisdiction that neither has nor 

asserts supervisory relationship, the kind of 

supervisory relationship that the chartering or 

licensing sovereign has. So I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say about the 

quotations in the -- the brief that Mr. Waxman filed, as 

I recall; it may have been the government's brief --

MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- which -- which do have 

references to visitorial powers as including general 

conformance to the law. Those are not universal 

provisions, but they -- they were certainly understood 

in some cases.

MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, the strongest 

quotations that his brief mentioned several times come 

from Blackstone. He talks about inquiring into all 

misbehaviors of the supervised visited corporation. 

Those comments are made in a time and place when there 

was only one sovereign, not the distinctive federalism 

we have today, and so there was no need to distinguish 

between the visitorial, the distinctly visitorial powers 

of the sovereign, and the coexisting police powers of 

another sovereign. There was no --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but there was -- there 

was a point in -- in distinguishing the visitorial 

powers that Blackstone, in the cases Blackstone was 

referring to, and those for example that would apply 

solely to -- to religious or originally religious 

foundations like Oxford and Cambridge colleges and so 

on. So there -- there seems to have been a reason to 

understand the distinction.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I think that the point 

about Blackstone's comment to distinguish -- the point 

about the distinction between the charitable 

corporations and the public non-charitable corporations 

is that it may well be that the sovereign was enforcing 

not just the charter, but the laws of the sovereign with 

respect to that State. It simply --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But he didn't need 

visitorial powers to do that. I mean, the sovereign had 

that by virtue of the general law.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes, but the sovereign might 

do it in many different -- a supervisor might do it in 

many different ways, just as OCC here claims to enforce 

law not by going into court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that was your 

position, that the -- that the visitation authority 

includes the power to enforce general laws.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: The general laws of the 

visitor, of the sovereign.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of the sovereign. But that 

a separate action to enforce the laws of the sovereign 

does not necessarily mean that visitorial powers are 

being exercised.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: That is correct. That is 

correct. That is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So there would be no 

inconsistency, if you believe that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: One thing --

MS. UNDERWOOD: That's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: One thing puzzled me about 

this. They are not pre-empting any New York laws; is 

that correct?

MS. UNDERWOOD: They're pre-empting --

that's correct. They are preempting our ability to 

enforce any laws.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Did we ever -- do we have 

any precedents dealing with the question whether 

preemption of the right to enforce a valid law is 

appropriate?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, this Court in, for 

example, St. Louis said that when the Federal and the 

State prohibition were the same, that is, a bank 

couldn't branch at that time or couldn't interstate 

branch, the -- and the -- and State tried to enforce 

both provisions -- they were the same, but the State 

tried to enforce both the Federal charter limitation and 

the State law, this Court said the State could not 

enforce the Federal charter, because that was the 

prerogative of the chartering visitor, but that it could 

enforce the State prohibition. And it said that 

separating -- if the law is valid and can be validly 

applied, then it's virtually unthinkable to separate the 

authority to enforce it from the application of the law.

 This Court said that in -- in St. Louis; it 

-- actually it said it in -- in Easton, which went the 

other way. That is to say, Easton was a criminal 

prosecution of a bank officer for taking deposits

knowing the bank was insolvent. Prosecution under State 

law. And this Court said that the law itself had to be 

preempted. Wasn't clear exactly what Federal law on the 

subject was. The Court said there must be some Federal 

law in this area, but we can't afford to have 

conflicting laws, so it's substantively pre-empted. But 

the Court also said, if it were valid, it would be 

unthinkable to bar the State from enforcing it. And 

that is the correct way, we think, to approach this 

problem.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is it -- could they --

could the Federal authorities pre-empt the State law, in 

your opinion?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, no, because Congress 

has said to the contrary. Congress has said, that's why 

they didn't -- presumably why they didn't do it that 

way. Congress has said State law shall apply. So I 

think this is an area where Congress clearly had in mind 

that there would be, not broad pre-emption of this kind, 

but the laws would apply. But that it --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but -- I'm 

sorry, but it certainly is pre-empted with respect to 

visitorial powers.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes. That is correct.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 FOR THE RESPONDENT OFFICE OF

 THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY

 MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 To explain the threat that the OCC believes 

the State's enforcement regime poses to the national 

banking system and OCC's administration of that system, 

I would like to begin by going back to a colloquy 

between Ms. Underwood and Justice Breyer near the 

beginning of the argument.

 And Justice Breyer raised the possibility 

that a myriad of State attorneys general would file --

would pursue similar antidiscrimination claims, and Ms. 

Underwood's response was there really would be no 

problem because they are all applying the same 

substantive standard. And I think at a very high level 

of generality that is so; that is, the Federal statute

and the State statute both say no discrimination on the 

basis of race in extensions of credit. But I think when 

you get to the way in which the statutes are 

administered, there is at least the potential for 

significant differences, because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait a minute. I --

this is state law. And if the State supreme court has 

said that the statute means a certain thing and that 

certain thing is a little bit different from what the 

Federal antidiscrimination law is, I assume that the 

Federal Government in applying State law has to -- has 

to take that difference into account, doesn't it?

 MR. STEWART: We would --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The Federal Government 

doesn't -- doesn't have the right to alter State law.

 MR. STEWART: The Federal Government 

wouldn't have the right to alter State law. The Federal 

Government would have the authority to make its own 

assessment of whether the State law was pre-empted based 

upon those distinctions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought it is a 

given in this case -- and tell me if I am wrong on this 

-- that the State substantive law is not pre-empted. 

You refer, I think, to enforcement pre-emption; that is, 

the State law is governing law. But the only enforcer

is Federal authority; and if that's so, is there any 

other -- in all of Federal-State relations, any other 

law where the State as sovereign can prescribe but 

cannot enforce?

 MR. STEWART: I give two examples from the 

national banking system, itself. The first is the 

Riegle-Neal amendments, which Justice Souter was 

alluding to. And the amendments don't simply say that 

OCC shall enforce non-pre-empted State laws. It says 

that those laws shall be enforced by the Comptroller of 

the Currency.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But do you -- do you agree 

that -- that it is possible to read the "shall" both as 

-- as an unequivocal grant of power to OCC, but not 

necessarily as an exclusive ground?

 MR. STEWART: I don't think so with the 

"shall" in combination with the passive voice. That is, 

if you had a statute that said a certain category of 

suits shall be adjudicated by the Court of Federal 

Claims, I think that would mean not simply that the 

Court of Federal Claims would be required to adjudicate 

them if a case was brought before it, but I think that 

would unmistakably identify the Court of Federal Claims 

as the exclusive tribunal --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but if you have a

situation in which the OCC, say, has very limited 

personnel -- they only have ten people in their 

enforcement division, for example -- and Congress 

thought they have to get more, wouldn't it be 

appropriate in that background to say, you shall start 

enforcing? And that wouldn't necessarily mean you are 

excluding States from also enforcing.

 MR. STEWART: I agree that if the statute 

simply -- if the statute used the active voice and said 

the OCC shall enforce these laws, there would be a 

better argument that the OCC's authority was not 

exclusive. But when the statute said -- says these laws 

shall be enforced by the Comptroller of the Currency, I 

think the clear implication is this is the exclusive 

mechanism by which the laws --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see any difference 

whatever in that regard between using the active and 

passive.

 MR. STEWART: Well, let me give you another 

example from the national banking system, and that is 12 

U.S.C. 85.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I want you to come back. I 

-- I won't stop -- I don't want to stop you from doing 

that, but I want to come back to this. Do you -- do you 

want to go on to your second example, or do you want to

MR. STEWART: Let me just give you a second 

example very quickly. 12 U.S.C. section 85, which was 

an issue in Smiley, deals with the maximum rate of 

interest that national banks may charge, and it says 

that they may charge as much as the law of the State in 

which they are located allows and no more. And that is 

a similar system in that to determine the maximum rate 

of interest that the bank may charge, you look to State 

law. You defer to the choice of the State legislature, 

but the enforcement regime with respect to 

administrative enforcement is exclusively Federal. It's 

only the Federal authorities that can go after --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's because --

because it's picking a rate. It's not saying there is 

the Federal law and it has this rate, and the State law 

that has that rate. Here, the Equal Credit Opportunity 

Act, a Federal Act, undoubtedly applies. And that is 

proper Federal -- Federal law enforced by the Federal 

authorities.

 The State law, as this picture is drawn for 

us, is applicable. It's substantive law applicable to 

these banks, but only the Federal authority can enforce 

it. That seems passing strange. And do you have an 

example outside the -- the two you gave us in the

National Bank Act where the State prescribes but the 

Federal authorities enforce?

 MR. STEWART: Well, another example would be 

the Similar Crimes Act, which provides for the 

incorporation of State law with respect to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's not State law 

applying of its own force, just as your second example 

was not State law applying of its own force. It was 

State law that had been converted into Federal law by 

the Federal Government's adoption of it.

 MR. STEWART: Those provisions --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different 

situation.

 MR. STEWART: Those provisions do accomplish 

incorporation of State law as Federal law. But this 

Court has repeatedly said, most recently in Watters, 

that State law applies to national banks only insofar as 

Congress shall see fit to permit it. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your concern that 

-- not with the substantive State law, but that leaving 

enforcement to the States would cause particular 

problems? I mean there may be a State law provision 

that says you shall do this, and the way the attorney 

general elects to enforce it is by shutting the bank 

down, jailing the bank officers, doing all sorts of

things that -- that the -- the Federal Government may 

not consider appropriate.

 MR. STEWART: That is certainly true, that 

the -- the State's exercise of remedial discretion may 

be different from the Federal Government's. But even 

before that stage, if you look at the letters in the 

Joint Appendix that the New York Attorney General's 

Office sent to the national banks in question, basically 

the thrust of the letters was: We have identified what 

we believe to be troubling statistical disparities in 

terms of the terms on which the credit was offered to 

applicants of different races. If those disparities are 

not satisfactorily explained, that it -- you may be in 

violation of State fair lending laws. Therefore, give 

us a wide variety of information that would allow us to 

determine whether you have a satisfactory explanation.

 And I think it's clear that had this process 

been allowed to run its course, what the New York 

Attorney General's Office was going to do was assess the 

bank's own criteria for making lending decisions to 

decide whether those criteria were suitable and decide, 

therefore, whether they provided a satisfactory 

explanation for the statistical disparities that had 

been observed.

 And once the New York A.G. is in the

business of passing upon the adequacy of the bank's 

lending criteria, he is right on the -- the OCC's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You are arguing for 

conflict pre-emption. I mean that's a -- that's a 

different issue than, say, that the -- the State law 

shouldn't apply. But don't tell me the State law 

applies, but only the Federal Government is -- what 

incentive does the Federal Government have to enforce 

State law?

 MR. STEWART: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it has so much spare 

time after enforcing Federal law that it's -- it's going 

to be worrying about State law?

 MR. STEWART: Well, the point that has been 

made at various times in the argument that the State law 

basically tracks Federal law, I think, is an answer to 

that question; that is, whatever incentive the Federal 

Government might have to enforce idiosyncratic features 

of State law that didn't have a Federal analogue. Here 

the State law in question prohibits discriminatory 

practices that are already prohibited by Federal law. 

So whether OCC and HUD set out to enforce State law, if 

they are vigorously enforcing Federal law, they will in 

the course of doing that vindicate the State's 

prerogatives.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is there any -- is there 

any legislative history whatever to the effect that at 

the time 36(f)(1)(B) was adopted -- to the effect that 

its effect was to pre-empt State enforcement for --

MR. STEWART: They -- they don't say it in 

-- with quite that degree of clarity, but there is a 

colloquy quoted in the -- the brief for the Clearing 

House between -- I believe it's Senator D'Amato and --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Senator D'Amato and --

MR. STEWART: And it is -- it is to the 

effect that Senator D'Amato expresses the concern that 

this may subject the -- the national banks in their 

branch activities to State supervision. And the 

response is that's not the case. That will happen with 

branches of State banks, but with respect to branches of 

national banks the supervision will be by the OCC.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the -- the problem 

I have with that is, as a -- as a kind of clear 

statement of -- of something which is -- is -- would be 

extraordinary -- is that it talks in terms of 

supervision. It doesn't use the -- my recollection is 

it doesn't use the magic word "enforcement."

 And I would have thought that if in the 

course of that colloquy the -- the statement had been 

made: The States will not have the authority to enforce

this, that there would have been rather a dust-up. And 

there wasn't. It's kind of a "dog that didn't bark" 

argument. And, therefore, if -- if there is uncertainty 

as to how to construe 36(f)(1)(B), I'm not sure that I 

-- I don't think the legislative history supports your 

exclusivity view.

 MR. STEWART: Well, section 36(f)(1)(A) 

refers to a very limited category of State laws that 

include State fair lending laws and said these laws will 

not be pre-empted unless they would be pre-empted with 

respect to national banks generally. And then 

36(f)(1)(B) says the laws in that preceding paragraph 

shall be enforced by the comptroller of the Currency. 

And so even if the colloquy used the term "supervision," 

the focus of the statutory language was -- was on a 

pretty narrow category of laws.

 I would like also to refer the Court to 12 

U.S.C. 484(b), which I think is relevant here, and it is 

on page 1a of the appendix to the government's brief. 

And it is an express exception to the general rule 

against the exercise of visitorial powers.

 And it says, "Notwithstanding subsection (a) 

of this section, lawfully authorized State auditors and 

examiners may at reasonable times and upon reasonable 

notice to a bank review its records solely to ensure

compliance with applicable State unclaimed property or 

escheat laws."

 Now, the basic thrust of --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Does that mean -- when they 

say "review records," does that mean that the State 

auditors in effect can walk into the bank, as 

distinguished from what we have here, in which the bank 

is being requested to produce excerpts from records?

 MR. STEWART: I think that would be the 

implication of the provision, but the significant point 

for our purposes is that it refers solely to ensure 

compliance with applicable State unclaimed property 

ordinances and laws.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this 

question? Naturally, if it's State laws, clearly they 

can look at, but what if New York was trying to enforce 

its discrimination laws in an employment context or in 

context where they said you are charging minority 

depositors -- giving them lower rates of interest than 

you give Caucasian depositors? Would they have -- would 

the discrimination and the rates of interests paid on 

deposits -- assume that was the question. Would you 

make the same argument, if that was what New York had 

alleged?

 MR. STEWART: Yes, we would because that

would be going to the banks' federally authorized 

banking --

JUSTICE STEVENS: All you would have to just 

look at the records. You can tell from the records 

whether people of different classes are paying different 

-- are getting different rates on their deposits.

 MR. STEWART: I mean, it might be that in 

that instance the discrimination would be unlikely to 

persist, but the basic --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It would be unlikely to 

persist. Maybe it's an unlikely example. But you are 

suggesting that that would also interfere with the 

Comptroller's ability to regulate the banks?

 MR. STEWART: Yes, the way the regulation is 

written, it speaks to State efforts to enforce laws that 

are directed at the bank's federally authorized banking 

activities.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So do you think the same 

answer whether -- Justice Stevens mentioned employment 

discrimination. The State has reason to believe the 

bank is discriminating in its employment policies, and 

it wants to examine certain employment records in that 

connection. Would you say also that, although New York 

can prescribe its antidiscrimination in employment law, 

it can't enforce it?

MR. STEWART: No, the regulation does sweep 

more categorically with respect to inspection of bank 

records. New York would not be forbidden to file 

lawsuits to enforce its employment discrimination laws.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does any of this bring us 

back to the colloquy you began -- began with -- between 

Justice Breyer and Ms. Underwood with reference to many 

States?

 MR. STEWART: Yes, a certain --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you began on that, 

and I never did hear --

MR. STEWART: The part of the point I was 

trying to make was, even if the substantive State law on 

its face is not pre-empted because it is identical to 

the Federal law, once we get to the enforcement stage 

where the relevant enforcement agency is saying your 

statistical disparity constitutes a violation because it 

is not justified by sound banking practices, inevitably 

that judgment is going to put the State regulator in the 

business of doing what OCC does. And if 50 different 

State attorneys general have slightly different ideas of 

what constitutes an adequate banking justification for 

lending criteria that produces statistical disparity, 

then the problem is multiplied. Then --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's conflict

pre-emption, and that goes to the -- to the law. You 

shouldn't have a separate State law that -- that 

provides a separate standard that conflicts with the 

Federal standard. So you pre-empt the law. You don't 

say the law is in effect, but the State can't enforce 

it. That's a weird way to solve that problem.

 MR. STEWART: Well, the other point I would 

make about this is that it is accurate to say that under 

the Federal regime the State is entirely disabled from 

enforcing its own fair lending law. As Ms. Underwood 

alluded to in the opening part of the argument and as 

the Petitioner's reply brief explains at pages 25 and 

26, the Fair Housing Act does contain a mechanism by 

which a State agency -- in the case of New York, it's 

the Division of Human Resources --- can be certified by 

HUD to enforce the State fair lending laws.

 But that certification entails two different 

steps: First, HUD has to determine that the substantive 

State law is -- I believe it's substantially equivalent 

to the comparable Federal law. And, second, HUD 

monitors the performance of the enforcing agency, the 

particular agency under State law that carries out that 

responsibility, and HUD can thereby make sure that 

enforcement as well as the substance of the law are 

consistent with Federal law.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 THE CLEARING HOUSE ASSOCIATION, L.L.C.

 MR. WAXMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Section 484 plainly has pre-emptive effect, 

and what it pre-empts, quoting this Court's decision in 

Watters, is, quote, "the State's investigative and 

enforcement machinery," close quote.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, your mention 

of Watters, which has been mentioned in the briefs, I 

think is an inaccurate description of what that opinion 

held. Watters dealt with a regime that was indisputably 

visitorial. It was a registration regime, where annual 

fees were paid, annual reports were filed with the State 

financial agency, and the State monitor could go into a 

lending organization any time for any reason without any 

suspicion of wrongdoing. The only -- so everyone agreed 

that was a visitorial regime.

 The sole question was whether the banks --

the national bank's operating subsidiary was to be 

equated with a division of the national bank. That was 

the only question provided the Court.

MR. WAXMAN: Oh, I -- I quite agree, and I 

did not mean to suggest that this Court's decision in 

Watters, you know, the holding in Watters concludes the 

outcome of this case. But this Court, in section II A 

of Watters -- and we did have a State statutory regime 

that dealt, yes, with licensure but also with 

examination, supervision, and enforcement, including 

judicial enforcement -- this Court repeatedly described 

that what was pre-empted is -- and this goes to, I 

think, a point that Justice Scalia was making -- was not 

substantive pre-emption. There are substantive 

pre-emption provisions that are addressed in other 

sections of the Act, including the one that was at issue 

in Smiley. What is exempted, this Court said again and 

again, is the State's enforcement and investment and --

investigative and enforcement machinery, or its 

examination and enforcement authority, and that those --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that was in the 

context of a State law that says, mortgage lending 

institution, you may not lend unless you register and do 

all the rest. That was the context of Watters. And I 

do not think that excerpts from that opinion should be 

taken out of that context, which was: You can't be in 

this business unless you register with us.

 MR. WAXMAN: The question in the case is

whether or not what the Attorney General here sought to 

do is the exercise of a visitorial power.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I -- can I take what 

Justice Ginsburg just said, and give you a thought that 

I am interested in your response to?

 I haven't seen the letter from the Attorney 

General. Is the whole thing in the record?

 MR. WAXMAN: There -- the letters are in the 

record in the Joint Appendix.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, reading Judge 

Parker's description of it, it seemed to me that what he 

had said was that there are statistical disparities 

between interest rates and race. Well, as long as, most 

unfortunately, income is correlated with race, with 

minorities being towards the bottom, of course such 

statistical disparities will exist, some legitimate, 

some not. So if the only basis for getting this 

information is that allegation, it's hard to see how 

this differs from the case that Justice Ginsburg put.

 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, that --

JUSTICE BREYER: But it might be quite a 

different case, if they had gone into court and found 

individuals who were really getting different interest 

rates and who really seemed very, very similar, but for 

race. But at that point, they'd have to go get this

same information, because that's where they would find 

whether that prima facie case was right or wrong.

 MR. WAXMAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you see what I'm doing?

 MR. WAXMAN: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm dividing the matter 

vertically, instead of, say, horizontally --

MR. WAXMAN: I'd like to --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- and I want to know if 

that's possible.

 MR. WAXMAN: I'd like to address both the 

vertical and horizontal axes of what I perceive to be 

your question. One is the distinction that this Court 

drew in Guthrie, where it said there is a -- there's a 

huge distinction in determining what's a visitorial 

power between a private individual seeking to vindicate 

a deprivation of his or her traditional property right, 

which is what was at issue there, and what the Court --

what this Court said was the public right of visitation, 

which it also explained was the State's, quote, 

"enforcing observance of its laws and regulations." 

There is a public and private distinction, and 

visitation deals with the former.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure, there is.

 MR. WAXMAN: It deals with the sovereign.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would -- would you 

acknowledge, counsel, that there is a difference between 

enforcing State laws through visitation and enforcing 

State laws apart from visitation? And what Waters 

involved was enforcing State laws through visitation. 

Of course, you can do that through -- through visitation 

powers, but you can also do apart from that by bringing 

a lawsuit or whatever.

 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Breyer, I'll get to the 

horizontal axis in a moment. I'm afraid I'm going to 

forget --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry, did I skip over 

an axis here.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't mean to.

 MR. WAXMAN: Let me go -- let me go to your 

axis first, which is to say that anything that is a 

visitorial power can also be interpreted as a police or 

enforcement power, and what Congress had in mind -- this 

is legislation that was born in the crucible of the 

Civil War, and what Congress sought to pre-empt was 

State executive action, State examination and 

enforcement action with respect to these newly created, 

very important Federal instrumentalities. That was 

historically done, this Court explained in Guthrie, and

Chancellor Kent and Blackstone and many other 

authorities agree was historically done through access 

to the courts; and in fact what Dean Pound in his 

oft-cited article about visitorial powers said, was --

he said, and this is discussed at pages 16 through 18 of 

the amicus brief of the Financial Services Roundtable --

what he called, quote, "the leading case for visitorial 

powers in equity" was a case called the Attorney General 

v Chicago and Northwest Railroad decided in 1874, in 

which the Attorney General of Wisconsin was seeking to 

require this railroad to comply with the State's 

mandated rate schedule. That was a visitorial power, 

even though you could also call it a law enforcement 

power.

 Now, Justice Breyer, on the horizontality of 

your question: This is not a suit in which the New York 

Attorney General is trying to enforce its employment 

discrimination laws or its health laws or its zoning 

laws. The attorney general wants the loan records of 

national banks, and he wants them so that he can 

evaluate for himself whether the banks are making proper 

judgments about how to market and how to price their 

loans.

money from you, and on the basis of all these interviews 

we have drawn these tentative conclusions that there is 

discrimination. We would like to give you an 

opportunity to explain all of this by showing us your 

records." And they say no, we won't do it. Would they 

then be pre-empted from bringing their lawsuit?

 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, they would. And in fact 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Even though they didn't 

have to look at any bank record to make their prima 

facie case?

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, their -- the OCC in the 

preamble to its regulations does draw a distinction 

between State enforcement actions and a pure State 

declaratory judgment, quote, "as to the meaning of the 

applicable law." This is a case that -- in which --

whether it's the State banking commission or the State 

human rights commission or the State attorney general, 

or for that matter another Federal Government authority, 

that seeks to call a national bank to account for the 

manner in which it is conducting an expressly 

designated, allocated banking power is an exercise of 

visitorial power.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it isn't -- it isn't 

if --

JUSTICE STEVENS: He doesn't even want to 

look at your books; he just wants to prove it by people 

who have been borrowing money and compare them with --

among them they can orally.

 MR. WAXMAN: I don't --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't understand why 

that would be visitorial power.

 MR. WAXMAN: The -- the State's enforcement 

of any law that is directed at a national bank's 

authorized banking powers is a visitorial power. And 

the fact that it may also be characterized as a police 

power or a lawsuit is -- is interesting, but not what's 

at stake.

knew -- the Supreme Court said, Blackstone and Kent had 

said -- that visitorial powers on civil corporations are

exercised A, by the sovereign, not by a private 

individual, and B, are almost always exercised through 

access to the courts. Whether they are invoking the 

courts' authority to seek records or not, that was the 

historical core of what visitorial powers --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So one could say, yes, 

the Federal authorities have visitorial powers, and they 

can go to court. But we have here that the State can 

prescribe, not a supervisory regime, but -- fair 

lending. And the State wants to go into court and say 

the bank is violating the State substantive law, which 

is applicable.

 MR. WAXMAN: That's correct. And a 

sovereign taking a national bank into court with respect 

to not any old general law, but with respect to the 

conduct of its specifically authorized national banking 

powers, is the exercise of visitorial powers.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is it --

MR. WAXMAN: That was the reason for the 

courts of justice exception.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is it the exercise of 

visitorial powers, or is it an action which covers the 

same subject that an exercise of visitorial powers would 

do? Let me -- let me propose a distinction, and I don't 

know whether this is sound. You know -- I mean, you

tell me.

 I would suppose that if someone with 

visitorial powers dealing with discrimination in lending 

brought an action against the bank or tried to enforce 

it against the bank and couldn't do so in any other way 

then by going to court, it would go to court, and it 

would say court, tell this institution that I have some 

responsibility for, to obey the law.

 But I also assume that if the Attorney 

General of New York, which is not a visitor, enforces 

the law, it would go into court and say tell them to 

obey the law and to pay damages or recompense of some 

sort to these people whom they have wronged.

 The subject matter of each suit is the same, 

but the relief that is being requested and the judicial 

power that is being exercised is different in these two 

cases. Is that a fair distinction?

 MR. WAXMAN: I don't think -- I think that 

if I understood your question, and I may not have -- if 

a suit by a private individual or a group of private 

individuals seeking to indicate the deprivation of a 

private traditional right is not visitorial; but if the 

State, either directly in the enforcement of its general 

laws or seeking to protect the people of its State, goes 

into court or asks for records or anything else, it is

exercising a traditional visitorial power.

 May -- while I have your attention, may I 

also go back to your question about 36(f) and 

Riegle-Neal, because there is yet -- there are other 

additional indicators that when the Congress said in 

36(f) that these State laws shall be enforced by the 

OCC, it was mandatory and exclusive.

 First of all, the colloquy that was 

discussed and is reported in our brief, I think at page 

26, does use the word "enforce" as well as "supervise," 

but more to the point --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That is the one with 

Senator D'Amato?

 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. Riegle-Neal -- here's the 

most important point. That provision that we've been 

were looking at had a cognate, had an analogue that was 

also enforced. Riegle-Neal basically said out-of-state 

banks can now branch bank. When they do so, they are 

subject to these four categories of State laws. The 

provision we have been looking, which was section 102, 

said with respect to enforcement of those laws, the OCC 

shall enforce it. But section 105 said where the 

out-of-state bank is a State-chartered bank -- and this 

is reported, I think it's at section 1820(h) of title 

12, when it's a State-chartered bank, the State

authorities of the host State shall enforce the laws.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Uh-huh.

 MR. WAXMAN: So it enacted a dual regime 

that demonstrates exactly what Congress had in mind, 

which is that there would be one regulator making the 

kind of judgments about, okay, there is a disparity, but 

let's look at credit history, let's look at the loan to 

equity value, let's look at income versus debt incurred, 

and all these factors that the OCC and the Fed have 

explained have to go into making a judgment about 

whether or not a particular condition of a particular 

loan violates Federal law, whether it the Fair Housing 

Act or the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the Fed's 

regulation B.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, you are 

talking about lending. And like depositing, those are 

core banking activities, but today national banks have a 

lot of incidental -- they have authority to do things 

incidental to banking. Does your restriction of State 

enforcement extend to those matters incidental to 

banking?

 MR. WAXMAN: May I answer? I believe that 

it would if those incidental authorities are in fact 

authorized, approved and regulated by the OCC, but this 

case doesn't require you to address it, because this is

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. UNDERWOOD: A couple of -- four points 

or so. To the extent the subpoena is perceived -- or 

this discovery request -- it didn't even proceed to this 

subpoena stage -- is perceived to be burdensome, State 

laws allows a motion to quash a subpoena for inadequate 

basis or for harassment. So there is control in the 

State courts over anything that is perceived to be 

excessive.

 Two, States have been enforcing consumer 

protection and fair lending laws since the mid '70s when 

they were enacted. The Center for Responsive Lending 

amicus brief has a discussion of that history of 

enforcement. The Conway affidavit at the Joint Appendix 

at 152 has a description of New York's enforcement 

activities between 1975 and 2004. And the Lawyers' 

Committee for Civil Rights also goes over that history.

 And they have been enforcing other laws 

against national banks for even longer, antitrust laws, 

branching laws, idiosyncratic laws of various sorts with 

no evidence that this has impaired the functions of the

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Underwood, I -- I 

forgot the response you made in your brief. I know you 

did make some response to subsection (b) of section 484. 

How do you -- how do you explain that?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: In the exceptions?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Why -- why do they 

list those exceptions, unless one would think that 

everything is covered?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Virtually every exception 

was enacted to resolve a controversy over whether 

something was visitorial or not. In fact, just as in 

Guthrie, where this Court said the shareholders' suit 

for bank records was not visitorial, or alternatively, 

if it is, it is covered by the courts of justice 

exception. So too, each of those exceptions involved a 

situation where there was a claim, an incorrect claim, 

but a claim that the action would be banned as 

visitorial, so Congress --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, why isn't 

it a complete answer to what I agree is a somewhat 

unusual situation of pre-empting enforcement but not the 

substance of law that its enforcement that raises the 

concerns? That the Federal Government thinks the State 

law is fine, but when you get attorneys general

enforcing it in a particular way, that's what causes the 

problem. And I mean, the problem arises in a lot of 

areas. Even within the Federal Government, the FBI and 

DEA have different ways of enforcing that might conflict 

with each other. Why doesn't that make perfect sense?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, even without 

enforcement of State law, OCC would not have exclusive 

control of enforcement of discrimination laws against 

national banks. So the idea that State enforcement 

poses some special problem to interfere with that 

exclusive control is just a mistake. That's not the way 

Congress set it up.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, why -- why is it 

a mistake? Why can't Congress or the OCC think that 

that's where the difficulties are going to arise? In 

other words, it's kind of a less intrusive approach, and 

saying, well, you can have your State law but we are 

concerned about enforcement, so we are going to be the 

ones that enforce it.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: I didn't mean it's a mistake 

of policy. I meant it's a mistake in description of the 

regime Congress created.

 HUD has administrative enforcement. DOJ has 

litigation enforcement. This is a Federal law. Private 

parties can enforce Federal fair housing law. States

can probably enforce Federal fair housing laws, too, as 

-- patriotic for the victim. The Second Circuit set 

aside that part of the injunction, the part that barred 

New York from enforcing Federal law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your answer is 

because they have different entities that can enforce 

it, they are sort of in for a penny, in for a pound? If 

you let anybody else enforce it, you have got to let 

everybody else enforce it?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: No, I don't say that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Including the 

entities that have historically have targeted national 

banks?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: I don't make that argument. 

What I say is that is strong evidence that Congress 

didn't intend to give OCC exclusive control here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose if -- if 

enforcement pre-emption is the lesser step, we probably 

ought to revise our jurisprudence so as not to tread any 

more heavily than we have to upon the States so that 

where there is conflict pre-emption, all we should say 

is the State law is not invalidated, it is simply not 

enforceable?

question would not be what we think is a good idea but 

what Congress has done. And here the OCC has 

interpreted what Congress has done is to make exclusive 

the OCC regulation only with respect to enforcement.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would suppose you 

would thank them for that rather than criticize them for 

it.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: I think that in many ways 

leaving the law intact and denying the States the 

ability to enforce it is more intrusive then simply 

finding pre-emption. In any event, Congress made it 

quite clear that it didn't want pre-emption.

 I think my time is up.
