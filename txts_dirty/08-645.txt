CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear argument 

next in Case 08-645, Abbott v. Abbott. 

Ms. Howe. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY HOWE 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. HOWE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The Hague Convention exists to ensure that 

custody disputes are resolved by the courts of the 

country of habitual residence rather than through 

abduction. It thus generally requires the return of a 

child who is abducted in violation of a right of 

custody. So too, a ne exeat right permits a parent to 

require that the child reside in the country of 

habitual residence, thereby rendering international 

abduction illegal. 

Ne exeat rights are not only rights of 

custody under the text of the convention, but they 

also track the convention's vital purpose of ensuring 

that children are not subject to international 

abduction. 

Under the convention, Mrs. Abbott cannot 

evade the jurisdiction of the Chilean courts by

abducting the child to Texas and then asking a Texas 

State court to nullify the rights granted to Mr. 

Abbott under Chilean law. That’s the sound view of 

the great majority of signatory courts to consider the 

issue as well as essential authorities in both the 

United States and Chile. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: How many --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You would be on 

absolutely sound ground if this were a convention on 

the mutual recognition of jurisdiction and judgment, 

but it's not. You -- you said the whole question is 

deferring to the courts of habitual residence, but 

this statute is not raised in terms of court 

jurisdiction. It's in terms of the right of a 

custodial parent. 

MS. HOWE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and 

Mr. Abbott has a statutory ne exeat right as well. 

The fact that he also has this right under the order 

is irrelevant, we believe, because no one is arguing 

for -- that -- the question is whether or not he has 

rights of custody under Chilean law, and it’s Chilean 

law that confers the ne exeat right. 

The fact that he also has this right under 

the order is -- is irrelevant for this case. If 

Mrs. Abbott --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You’re not relying on the 

order; you’re just relying on the statute? 

MS. HOWE: We are relying just on the 

statute. 

JUSTICE BREYER: If that's so, imagine a 

well-educated American woman marries a man from a 

foreign country X. They have a divorce. The judge 

says, the man is completely at fault here, a real 

rotter. The woman is 100 percent entitled to every 

possible bit of custody, and the man can see the child 

twice a year on Christmas Day at 4:00 in the morning. 

That's it. 

Now, there's a law like Chile's that says 

you can't take the child out of the country without 

the permission of the father too, this person who gets 

to see the child twice a year. And you’re saying that 

that's custody. It’s custody, and -- and what is the 

woman supposed to do? 

She can't get a decent job worthy of her 

education. The -- the -- all the courts said that 

she's entitled to the child. She has to choose 

between her life and her child. And -- and is that 

what this -- this convention is aimed at? 

MS. HOWE: It would be a right of custody, 

Justice Breyer, that the convention doesn't look to

the purpose. All it looks --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now -- now, of course, what 

I'm asking you with my example --

MS. HOWE: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Is why interpret it that 

way, where all that you have is a rule of law that 

applies to everybody, even in the case I've tried to 

imagine, where to say it's a right of custody would 

ruin the life of the woman, would give the husband 

something which he should -- certainly shouldn't have 

in any moral term, it would seem, and she comes back 

to the United States and is forced to give her child 

back to whatever this country is. I have called it X. 

Now, why give that kind of interpretation to this 

statute, which seems to have a purpose that’s looking 

after women and children? 

MS. HOWE: Certainly. The -- the statute 

that you hypothesize in this case, Justice Breyer, 

reflects the domestic country's judgment that the 

child should remain in the country, unless the father 

agrees to its departure. We don't look to why the 

child's -- why the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's your 

conclusion. I'm just trying to get -- to see if there 

is any humane purpose underlying the interpretation

that you have advocated, and certainly there are two 

interpretations here. Your opponents will soon

MS. HOWE: Certainly -- I mean --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is an alternative, 

isn't there? 

MS. HOWE: There is an alternative. I mean, 

certainly under Chilean --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: For the woman to go to 

the Chilean court? 

MS. HOWE: Exactly, Justice Sotomayor. 

Under Chilean law and presumably under the law that 

you've hypothesized as well, Justice Breyer, the woman 

could go to court and ask for permission to leave the 

country, and that's precisely what Mrs. Abbott could 

have done in this case. She just never opted to do 

that. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose you --

suppose you have a --

JUSTICE BREYER: That isn’t my question. 

MS. HOWE: Okay. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to get at what 

the humane purpose would be, given your interpretation 

of the law in this kind of situation? 

MS. HOWE: Well, the right to determine

whether your child will remain in the country or go to 

another country is a very important right, and it's 

simply that that's the -- if that's the law that the 

-- that the country has decided to establish, the 

convention doesn't look to why that is. 

And the drafters expressly envisioned, 

Justice Breyer, that there would be cases in which one 

parent would have physical custody of the child, the 

other parent would simply have the right to determine 

the child's place of residence. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what if -- what if 

you’d have a country in which ne exeat orders are 

routinely imposed in every custody case? Then it's 

almost like your statutory case here. What does that 

have to do with custody? 

MS. HOWE: Well, that, again, simply 

reflects that country's judgment. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems -- excuse me, 

MS. HOWE: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but I'll just finish my 

own question. 

MS. HOWE: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that what 

you are saying is that, in some countries, there --

there is a presumption that there is always custody in

the party -- in both parties. 

MS. HOWE: There may be a presumption. We 

have researched, and we don't believe that that’s 

actually particularly common, Justice Breyer. But 

certainly in many countries, there’s now a presumption 

of joint custody. 

And so, in all of those cases, under the 

convention, the left-behind parent would be entitled 

to the child's return. And the convention, again, 

doesn't look to the purpose. It doesn't look to --

there's nothing in the convention, certainly, that 

requires that there be one category of parents who 

have rights of custody and are entitled to the return 

and another category of parents who are not entitled 

to the return remedy. There's a -- there's a system 

of mutual trust under the convention and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What happens to the woman 

who, now she has abducted the child to Texas, and she 

says to the Texas court: If you send me back, I am 

going to be beaten by this man who has a history of 

being a batterer? 

MS. HOWE: Two things, please, 

Justice Ginsburg. The first is that that could happen 

in any case, not simply a case involving a ne exeat 

right, but also a case in which the left-behind parent

had joint custody, and so to a -- the second is that 

the convention -- yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You are saying that the 

court -- the court that’s asked to give effect to the 

convention is helpless, that it's automatic that if 

there is a custody right, the court in the state to 

which the child has been taken must order that the 

child be returned? 

MS. HOWE: No -- no, Justice Ginsburg. 

Article 13(b) of the convention provides an 

affirmative defense to -- to return if the court in 

the country of refuge determines that the child would 

face either a grave risk of physical or psychological 

harm or otherwise face an intolerable situation. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: As long as you brought 

that up, I was just going to ask: Should -- if you 

prevail in this case, should there be a remand to see 

if that section applies? 

MS. HOWE: Article 13(b) has not previously 

been raised in this case, but in any event, 

regardless, if this Court were to rule in our favor, 

then the appropriate course would be to remand for 

resolution of any remaining issues, yes, 

Justice Kennedy.

gave about concern for the protection of the child, 

that applies only to the child? In other words, in 

the case that we have been discussing, if the woman 

would be subject to whatever persecution or domestic 

violence, but the child -- you know, there’s no 

suggestion of any harm targeted to the child, that 

would not be a case in which they could grant refuge? 

MS. HOWE: The -- the statute does -- the 

text does apply to the grave risk of physical or 

psychological harm to the child, and certainly --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To only -- only to 

the child? 

MS. HOWE: Only to the child, although 

arguably there would be some risk of psychological 

harm if what the woman's allegation --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the woman would 

be subject to -- if she wanted to remain with the 

child, there would be no protection. She would have 

to choose between subjecting herself to violence or 

being apart from the child? 

MS. HOWE: Well, the courts could also, of 

course, Chief Justice Roberts, try, you know, to solve 

the problem through undertakings and placing 

conditions on the child's return, if the -- if the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be 

consistent with the convention, for the returning 

state to say, we are returning the child, but only 

if -- you know, bang, bang, bang? 

MS. HOWE: Well, in other contexts, for 

example in the context of visas, yes. The Special 

Commission meetings, when this issue has come up, has 

specifically urged the court -- or urged courts to 

consider undertakings and also to consider 

intergovernmental negotiations in an attempt to ensure 

both the mother and the child's safe return, yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What’s the law -- what is 

the law if a mother and a child -- sorry. What’s the 

law if a couple living in a foreign country has a 

decree of the court, and the decree of the court 

grants certain visiting rights to the father, and the 

father, violating those rights, takes the child to a 

different country. Can the mother get it back? 

MS. HOWE: I'm sorry. Could you --

JUSTICE BREYER: What’s the normal law where 

you have a couple -- they’re supposed to leave the 

child in the country, but it doesn't say that.

international remedy. In the United States, for 

example --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sure there isn't, but 

under the law --

MS. HOWE: -- there could be, for example, 

the UCCJEA in the United States. You could go to 

court with an international order and attempt to seek 

the child's return in that manner, yes. You would 

attempt to seek enforcement of the court's order in 

the United States. 

JUSTICE BREYER: You would go and take the 

court's order to a court in the United States and try 

to enforce it? 

MS. HOWE: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And the American court 

would be under obligation, I guess, to enforce it? 

MS. HOWE: In theory, yes. Yes.

question here is which of the two mechanisms should we

MS. HOWE: One thing that -- that may give 

you some comfort, as far as the convention's drafters 

are concerned, is that this was a scenario that the 

convention's drafters had in mind from the very 

beginning of the drafting process. They had five 

scenarios that they --

JUSTICE BREYER: I’ve read through that, and 

I’ll tell you that, on the basis of my reading through 

all that stuff, my mind is in equipoise. I find some 

one way, some the other. 

I think maybe each side does a little 

overstating here, but -- but I -- I am in equipoise, 

having looked at that quickly. So I know -- I know 

the stuff, you can -- but that's why I am trying to 

get to the underlying humane idea that’s supposed to 

underlie that, and see if it applies here. 

MS. HOWE: Okay. The -- the convention was 

drafted on the premise that the best interests of 

children are served by their return to the country of 

habitual residence, so that the courts in that country 

can make the decisions. The convention --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Howe, wasn't the --

the problem that gave rise to this Abduction 

Convention just the situation that Justice Breyer 

brought up? That is, the parent that has visitation

rights snatches the child, takes it to that parent's 

home country, and then you are relying on only the 

court order. That's why we have the Hague Convention 

on the Abduction of Children. 

It wasn't for the -- I mean, this -- this 

case is not the usual case. The usual case is the 

noncustodial parent takes the child out of the country 

where the custodial parent lives. And, 

internationally, there was a huge problem of getting 

the child back, and that's why we have the Hague 

Convention on Abduction, because courts weren't 

enforcing foreign court orders. 

MS. HOWE: That's right. They were -- they 

were not enforcing foreign court orders, and it's 

true, Justice Ginsburg, as you say, that the sort of 

prototypical case that was present when they drafted 

the convention was that one parent, usually the 

mother, would have sole physical custody and the 

father would have just visitation, and it was intended 

to address that problem. 

But at the time that they drafted the 

convention, they also had in mind the increasing 

prevalence of joint custody and included that in the 

convention. And they also recognized, as I said, that 

there would be scenarios in which one parent would

have what we’d consider to be physical custody of the 

child; the other parent would have other rights, such 

as the right to determine the child's place of 

residence. And they did intend for the parent who did 

not have physical custody but had other important 

rights relating to the child, such as the right to 

determine the child's place of residence, to be --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what is the -- what 

is the significance of their breaking down the two 

categories? One is the rights of custody, and the 

other is rights of access. 

Because I take it that under your view of 

the Chilean law, given that the noncustodial parent 

will always have this right to block taking the child 

out of the country, then there's really no difference 

between the two categories, because every, say, father 

with the right of access -- not custody, just access 

-- would automatically by virtue of the law of Chile 

have this one custodial right; that is, to block 

taking the child out of the country. 

MS. HOWE: It's true. But again, 

Justice Ginsburg, you don't look at why the country 

attributed those particular rights. You just look at 

whether the parent has those rights. 

And I think it's helpful to think of the

Chilean system, in effect, as a -- as a form of joint

what we would regard as joint custody. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Does your argument really 

boil down to the claim that this was, in effect, joint 

custody? It seems to me it clearly was not. 

MS. HOWE: We believe that the Chilean 

system is analogous to joint custody. There’s a 

presumption that -- but it --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I’d say it's not, but --

MS. HOWE: But --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but are you arguing 

that this -- that this case is -- is the equivalent of 

a joint custody case? 

MS. HOWE: No. We are arguing that the 

ne exeat right is a right of custody under the text of 

the convention. 

If the Court has no further questions --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you’re saying -- I 

know the white light's on -- but you are saying that 

every case that involves the Chilean government, the 

convention here is applicable, requiring return? 

MS. HOWE: If the parent has visitation 

rights, then yes. That's simply the way that Chile 

has opted to do it.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER ANDERS 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

MS. ANDERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The ne exeat provision at issue in this case 

gave Petitioner the power to prevent exactly the harm 

that is the Hague Convention's central concern. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you -- do you agree 

that every case originating in Chile must come out 

this way, so that there is a return required? 

MS. ANDERS: I agree that Chile has by law 

decided that the ne exeat right should arise 

automatically in any parent who has visitation rights. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that seems to me 

remote from the concept of custody that the convention 

has in mind. 

MS. ANDERS: I don't think so, Justice 

Kennedy. I think the convention -- the explanatory 

report makes clear that the convention is designed to 

protect all of the ways in which joint custody can 

arise and be awarded under domestic law. And I think

we have a variety of situations in every country in 

which joint custodial rights arise automatically. 

For instance, in the United States, when two 

parents are married and separated, and there has been 

no custody order yet, we would say that both of those 

parents have automatic joint custody rights in the 

child. In civil law countries, there are a variety of 

automatic joint custodial decision-making --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But is there a distinction 

between the -- what’s before us in this case and the 

different case in which the order specifically said 

custody shall be joint? The same -- would that not be 

a different case, in your view? 

MS. ANDERS: It would not be a different 

case, because the convention protects rights of 

custody, and it specifies that those rights can be 

awarded jointly. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the decree says that 

custody -- the mother is the one who has custody. 

MS. ANDERS: The mother may have most of the 

custodial rights, what we would think of as physical 

custody, but the convention protects rights of 

custody. And I think what’s particularly important is 

that it separates out the right to determine residence 

as the most important custody right with which it is

concerned. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What they seem to be 

thinking of -- this is -- maybe you can get at what is 

bothering me. I’m perhaps not articulating it very 

well. But the -- where there's any kind of a custody 

right, I normally think there was a human being called 

a family law judge who has a very tough job, and he 

has looked at the situation of these two people here 

and the child. And he said, at least: Smith and Mrs. 

Smith, you are each going to have a little bit, at 

least. 

Now, but in a situation where he says to 

Mr. Smith, nothing, I want to give you nothing -- he 

thinks this is Frankenstein's monster; he does not 

want to give him a single thing -- that, on your 

interpretation of this statute, that doesn't matter. 

Just because Chile has a general law that says you 

can't take anybody out of the country without 

permission, just because of that, even Frankenstein's 

monster is considered to have custody for the purposes 

of this, though the human being who looked at this, 

called the family law judge, said: Don't let him near 

that child. All right? 

Now, that's -- don't pick up on my errors in 

that I know I haven't stated it quite right, but look

at what I'm driving at. And that's what's bothering 

me. 

MS. ANDERS: Well, I think Chile could have 

made a determination as a matter of its domestic law, 

that it would be in the child’s interest --

JUSTICE BREYER: I know there are ways out, 

but why should we include custody to be a situation 

where the human being who looked at this couple 

thought that that individual, the husband, should have 

nothing but visit him occasionally on Christmas? Why 

should we interpret the word "custody" in this treaty 

to include even that situation, which turns the treaty 

into a general “return the child” no matter what? 

MS. ANDERS: Well, I think the convention's 

fundamental principles actually are in line with your 

concerns, because what the convention says is that 

anytime that the child has been abducted in violation 

of a decision-making right that the -- that one or the 

other parent has, then the child should be returned. 

But the return remedy is not a determination 

that the child should live with the left-behind parent 

or that he should live out the rest of his life in 

Chile. It's simply a determination that the courts of 

the country of habitual residence should decide what 

should happen with the child going forward. That's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Ms. Anders, that's the 

point, isn't it? The purpose of the convention is 

which court will decide the life of that child, 

correct? 

MS. ANDERS: That's exactly right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And to avoid, as I 

understood the convention structure, this flight from 

court to court and this long, drawn-out process from 

country to country over who's going to make that 

choice, correct? 

MS. ANDERS: That's right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so the idea is, 

whether it's one custody right -- correct me if I am 

wrong -- whether it's one custody right or many, which 

court is going to decide what's in the best interest 

of that child? 

MS. ANDERS: That's exactly right, and I 

think the ne exeat right is very --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if -- so 

that if you have the mother taking her daughter from, 

say, a country where she would be forced to be raised 

under sharia law and that -- that is up to that 

country to decide whether the child has to be 

returned? Or is there a basis for a domestic tribunal

in the court, in the -- what is it called, the country 

of refuge? Can that country decide that the child 

should not be returned? 

MS. ANDERS: There are narrow defenses to 

return, and one of those is the grave risk defense in 

article 13(b). There’s also a fundamental principles 

defense in article 20. But, fundamentally, I think 

the convention is premised on the idea that the courts 

of the various states parties will be well-placed to 

determine the custody --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's your 

position that, in that case, the mother should return 

her daughter to the country where she will be raised 

under a system that the mother finds quite offensive? 

MS. ANDERS: Well, that would not 

necessarily be the case. Presumably, that mother 

could raise the 13(b) defense or the article 20 

defense to return, and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what -- I know 

Ms. Howe cited it. What is the standard on the 13(b) 

defense? 

MS. ANDERS: It says, "A grave risk that the 

return would expose the child to physical or 

psychological harm."

status of, in this case, women in the country, does 

that constitute grave risk, or is it an individualized 

determination? 

MS. ANDERS: I think it would generally be 

an individualized determination. But I think the 

convention is based on the assumption that wherever --

wherever the parent started out, wherever their 

custody determinations are being made to begin with, 

that is the country that should continue in the normal 

situation to determine what should be in the interest 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that country is 

going to make a determination in favor of their 

domestic law and their domestic system. Presumably, 

they are not going to say: We think it's a grave risk 

to the child to be raised under our system. 

MS. ANDERS: Well, it would be the -- it 

would be the courts in the country of residence that 

would be making that determination. But I think the 

question of which court might have a more favorable 

determination, that -- that kind of forum-shopping is 

precisely what the convention was trying to prevent. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, could we interpret 

the words "great psychological harm" to include, for 

example, a situation where an educated woman with an

advanced degree is unable to get work in the country 

where her child lives and has to live under conditions 

that are -- that are really -- we would say are fairly 

primitive because of her inability to find an 

appropriate employment? Can you include that under 

great psychological harm, so that the child wouldn't 

have to go back? 

MS. ANDERS: Well, I -- I presume that you 

could, in an individual case, offer evidence that 

might include things like --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, has there ever been 

-- would you advocate that kind of very broad standard 

of great psychological -- and what would be your 

position, or what's the government's position on that? 

MS. ANDERS: It’s that the defense would be 

more narrow than that. But that's because, first, the 

convention is based on the idea that -- that the 

courts of the country of habitual residence can make 

this determination in the child's best interest, and 

that they should be the ones to do that -- we 

shouldn't allow forum-shopping -- and also because the 

return remedy is not a determination that the child 

will have to stay in the country for the rest of his 

life or even that the mother would necessarily have to 

return with him.

United States joined the consensus of the states 

parties that a ne exeat right should be considered a

parent -- that is, the person in the situation of the 

mother here -- that what Congress was told was the 

urgent problem was the noncustodial parent taking the 

child away from the custodial parent. That was the --

the major thing that drove this convention and that's 

what the State Department told Congress; isn't that 

so?

Department's legal analysis stated that the typical 

case might be one in which a parent with -- with 

primary physical custody had the child, but the 

visiting -- the parent with visitation rights took the 

child to another country. But the fact that it was a 

typical case means that it wasn't the only type of 

case, and as -- as family law has developed over the 

past 30 years, joint rights of custody have become 

more and more prevalent, and we, therefore, think that 

this is a joint right to determine residence under the 

convention, because it gives the father the right to 

withhold or grant consent to the child's removal from 

the country. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Hays. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KARL E. HAYS 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. HAYS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Rights of custody and rights of access are 

very different and distinct substantive rights. The 

Hague Convention makes a distinction between those two 

sets of rights and provides the automatic return 

remedy only in those situations where there has been a 

breach of a right of custody.

What Mr. Abbott is seeking in this case is 

to have the Court define a bright-line rule, saying 

that in any instance where there is a statute or a 

provision which limits the rights of the custodial 

parent to remove a child outside of -- of the 

particular jurisdiction, that any time there is a 

statute or ordinance or order to that effect, that you 

confer rights of custody upon an individual who would 

otherwise only have rights of access. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you could say --

you can say that the mother did not have full 

custodial rights. One custodial right is certainly to 

determine where the child will live. And the mother 

did not have that right with respect to taking the 

child out of the country. 

MR. HAYS: The mother did not have the right 

to take the child out of the country without either 

obtaining the permission of the father or obtaining 

permission of the court to do that. That was a 

limitation on her exercise of custodial rights. It 

did not, in and of itself, grant a right to the 

father. The father was not granted a custodial right. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you could say that 

the limitation on the custodial right is the right of 

the husband to visit once a month or 3 -- 3 weeks a

month. I -- I think that's slightly an artificial 

approach. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a provision --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume there’s a 

law that says joint custody; mom can determine the 

place to live; mom can determine the education of the 

child; dad can visit when he wants; dad can review 

choices but not veto them. But we consider this joint 

custody. 

Under your view, what defines custody under 

the convention in a way that would justify an American 

court saying, that's not a custodial right; even 

though the law of that domestic jurisdiction defines 

that and says, that's our terms of joint custody, but 

we create this kind of joint custody? 

MR. HAYS: In -- in that situation, the --

the rights are created under the law of the 

jurisdiction, and that -- and that -- in that 

instance, it would be a joint custodial right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right. Regardless of 

what the terms of that right are, so long as the 

domestic law deems it such, correct? 

MR. HAYS: Right. But in this instance the 

Chilean courts have not created a joint custodial 

right within the common --

convention doesn't define custodial rights, correct? 

It doesn't give them meaning except in one way, the 

right to determine a place of residence, correct? 

MR. HAYS: No, Your Honor. What happens is 

the -- the convention contains an understanding of 

what the parties at the time of the drafting of the 

convention understood custodial rights to entail. The 

focus of the convention was on maintaining the 

relationship between the parent that was providing 

care. And so the members of the convention --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, that's a little 

tough, because parents provide care in so many 

different ways. And weren't the convention members 

very cognizant of the fact that in different countries 

that has different meanings? 

MR. HAYS: They were. But they understood 

that there was a commonly accepted understanding of 

custody in terms of the party who had care for the 

child. And that was --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's not the word they 

used. They used "custody rights including determining 

the place of residence." So they didn't give any 

greater meaning to the word "care" than that.

article 5 is “rights of custody shall include rights 

relating to the care of the person of the child,” and 

then they said, “and in particular, the right to 

determine the child's place of residence.” 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose there’s a 

court order that prohibits the -- one of the 

parents -- the parent with whom the child lives most 

of the time from moving more than an hour's drive from 

the prior place of residence, would that be --

would -- would the -- the other parent then have 

custody? 

MR. HAYS: No. Here again, that is -- that 

is simply a restriction placed upon that parent's 

right to exercise custody. It is -- it is --

JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the court order says 

that the -- that the child may not move from the house 

where the child lives now. Would that be custody? 

MR. HAYS: Again, that is -- that is simply 

a restriction on that parent's right to exercise 

their -- their custodial authority. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what’s the meaning of 

the phrase "determine the place of residence"? 

MR. HAYS: “Determine the place of 

residence” was -- was placed into the convention 

because that ordinarily is a right of custody. A

parent who ordinarily has the care of the child has 

the child with them. 

And I would hazard a guess that if you were 

to ask anyone in this courtroom what their residence 

was, they would tell you that their residence is 123 

Maple Street, that it doesn't entail the determination 

of the actual country --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, okay. So, if -- it 

there’s a court order that says the child shall not 

move from 123 Maple Street without the consent of both 

parents, do both parents then have custody? 

MR. HAYS: In -- in that instance, there may 

be a -- a joint right regarding the -- the 

determination of the residence, which is not what we 

have in -- which is not what we have in this case. 

But here again, it is -- it is more in keeping with 

simply putting a restriction upon the parents who --

the parent who has the right of custody, their right 

to exercise that. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hays --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If he has the right to 

say no, don't take the child out of the country, then 

he has something more than a right of access. You --

it's his consent in the first instance. He has a 

right to determine that the child shall not live 

outside the country of habitual residence. That is 

not a right of access. 

MR. HAYS: It's important to understand here 

that -- that he does not have a -- a right under the 

Chilean statute. If --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the statute 

says the consent of the -- of the other parent. 

MR. HAYS: The -- the statute says, first of 

all, that if you -- you have the consent of the 

parent, but if you don't get the consent of the 

parent, you go -- you go to the court. So it is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that’s true of 

custody decrees generally. We get them modified by a 

court in the best interests of the child. So it --

but in the first instance, it says -- it’s he has the 

consent or withholding consent. And my question to 

you is, whatever that is, it isn't a right of access? 

MR. HAYS: It's actually not -- it -- and 

that’s -- and that’s the position that Mr. Abbott 

wants this Court to -- to take, is that, well, it's a 

right, and since it's not a right of access, it has to 

be a right of custody.

right. It is a means of doing two things, which is 

what the United States recognized at the time of the 

drafting of the convention. It is a means of 

preserving the jurisdiction of the court. It is also 

a means of enforcing access rights. It’s a procedural 

right; it is not a substantive right. And the -- the 

Hague Convention clearly makes a distinction between 

substantive rights of custody and substantive rights 

of access. But what -- what the -- Mr. Abbott wants

right of access is the right to take a child for a 

limited period of time to a place other than the 

child's habitual residence. There’s nothing about 

procedure or substance in this; it says this is what 

right to custody is, and this is what right of access 

is. 

MR. HAYS: Actually, Your Honor, what the --

what the convention does is not specifically define 

either term. The -- the terminology is -- is it 

includes these particular rights, because they didn't 

want to get specific as to what exactly rights of 

custody entailed, what exactly rights of access 

entailed.

ways so far as you are concerned, because it includes

insist on living in a specific country. 

MR. HAYS: That was not the understanding of 

the -- of the drafters of the convention, because --

and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, textually, that’s 

certainly plausible. 

MR. HAYS: Textually, when -- when you 

examine article -- when you examine article 5 in 

conjunction with article 3 and article 13, that 

doesn't -- that doesn't follow, because article 3 and 

article 13 both provide that the rights had to be 

actually exercised. And when you -- you read the 

Pérez-Vera report, which is analyzing both of those 

sections, it -- it’s clear that the intent of the 

drafters at the time was that you had to have actual 

physical care of the child, because the purpose of 

this -- of this convention was to prevent the 

situation that this Court has already discussed, and 

that is, a parent who has custodial rights, full 

custody of a child -- the other parent kidnaps the 

child and takes them to another country in order to 

seek a -- another court order. 

In this case, you don't have that situation.

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question 

about the term “place” -- “place of residence”? 

Putting aside the control of the ne exeat that would 

prevent her from leaving the country, just looking at 

the situation within Chile, what -- did she have any 

limitation on her right to pick that place of 

residence within Chile? 

MR. HAYS: Absolutely not. She could decide 

wherever she wanted to live in Chile under the court 

order that she was given. She had full control over 

deciding where -- where her son was to live --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So, the only control that 

the -- the husband had was the right -- whatever right 

was given by the ne exeat provision, that you can't 

take the child out of the country? 

MR. HAYS: That's correct. That she had to 

first get either his permission or go to court and get 

permission of the -- of the court. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And even if there had been 

no fight of the kind that developed, she would have 

had a unrestricted right to pick the place of 

residence? 

MR. HAYS: Absolutely. She -- she had the

absolute right to decide all issues with respect to 

her son. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Which is more important, 

determining the house in which the child is going to 

live or determining the country in which the child is 

going to live? 

MR. HAYS: For purposes of the convention, 

determining the house where -- where the child lives, 

determining the issues relating to the care of the 

child, because that was what the convention was 

intended to protect, that relationship, because you 

were having situations where a parent who had a 

custodial relationship with the child would have that 

relationship severed by the other parent taking the 

child, going to another country, and then seeking a 

court order. 

And there is one thing that I think needs to 

be corrected here. When Mrs. Abbott went to Texas, 

she did not attempt to obtain a court order that would 

have stripped Mr. Abbott of his rights. In fact, in 

Texas the presumption is joint managing 

conservatorship. And she asked for sole managing 

conservatorship, which would have been the equivalent 

of what she was granted under Chilean law.

this convention have wanted to regard a parent as 

having custodial rights if the parent has the right to 

veto a change of address within a country, but not 

when the parent has the authority to veto the future 

nationality and cultural background of the child? 

MR. HAYS: They very well may not have 

intended either of those instances to create a -- a 

joint right of -- of custody. At the point in time 

when the convention was being drafted, joint custodial 

rights were -- were basically a new concept, and there 

were -- there was not a lot of experience in the 

exercise of joint -- of joint custodial rights. 

The -- the focus of the convention was 

ensuring that the parent who had the primary 

relationship with -- with the child, that that 

relationship would not be severed by someone taking a 

child out of -- of the country. And that was the 

focus of -- of the convention, which is why there was 

a distinct difference drawn between protecting rights 

of access and protecting rights of -- rights of 

custody. 

Rights of access were given different 

protection mechanisms under -- under the convention, 

as opposed to the mandatory return that was -- that 

was envisioned by rights -- by --

JUSTICE ALITO: I don't want to belabor 

the point too much, but maybe you could just give 

me an example of a court order that you believe 

would give a parent the right to determine place of 

residence and, therefore, would constitute custody 

within the meaning of the convention. 

MR. HAYS: Typically -- typically in -- in 

Texas, Texas adheres to a position of joint managing 

conservatorship. The presumption in Texas is that 

both parents have equal ability to make decisions 

regarding their child. And so the courts will 

routinely enter orders to say both parents get to 

decide education, both parents get to decide medical 

issues. 

Even in that instance, though, the court 

will attribute the right to determine the primary 

residence of the child to one parent or the other, and 

will impose a -- a restriction on the exercise of that 

right. They will impose a geographical restriction 

and say, you can establish residence only in this 

county or -- or contiguous counties. 

That’s in the nature, though, of a -- of a 

joint managing conservatorship or joint custody 

situation. What we have in this case, though, is an 

instance where all of the custodial rights, all of the

decisionmaking authority was given solely to the 

mother. The --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not according to the --

what is it, the Chilean central authority, you know, 

the letter that was sent to the Second Circuit, I 

think in the Duran case. The -- the authority within 

Chile that is responsible for the implementation of 

this Hague Convention said that it regarded that 

statute to create a custody right for purposes of the 

Hague Convention. 

MR. HAYS: Actually, Your Honor, that --

that statement in the briefs is a -- is a misstatement 

of what happened in the Beaumont case. In 

Duran v. Beaumont, there are -- there are distinctions 

that have not been made by -- by Mr. Abbott. Most 

importantly, there was no court order in that case. 

And, when there is no court order, under Chilean law, 

it is a situation where there is joint custody as a 

matter of law. 

Secondly, the actual affidavit -- and the 

language of the affidavit is quoted in the dissent to 

that case. The actual affidavit states both parents 

have the guard and custody of their daughter, and the 

decisions of major importance must be adopted by both 

parents.

So, clearly, the Chilean authority was 

referencing in their -- in their affidavits they 

provided in that case, to the fact that this was a 

joint custody situation. And they -- they didn't 

decide it solely on the basis of -- that this ne exeat 

statute created a right of custody. Also --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was a 

sentence in there -- and you can correct me if I'm 

wrong -- that said that the statute, under Chilean 

law, amounted to a right of joint custody. 

MR. HAYS: The wording -- the wording of --

of the sentence, it includes the statute. It's like 

the statute, comma, the guard and custody, and also 

decisions of major importance. It's -- it's a number 

of things. It's not just singled out the way that 

Mr. Abbott has -- has presented it to the court. 

They don't make a statement saying, this 

statute equates to rights of custody. It's a 

situation where they say, you take all of this 

together, the fact that they had the guard and custody 

of their daughter and the decisions of major 

importance must be adopted by both parents -- you take 

all of that together as the finding of the Chilean 

authority that, in fact, the parent in that case had 

joint decisions and had -- had rights of custody that

were being breached. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So if I -- if I think, as 

Justice Alito was starting out, that if the -- a court 

order in the divorce case says the father and mother 

will jointly decide what house to live in, that the 

father has a custody right, if it jointly says the 

father and the mother will decide what State to live 

in, that that's a custody right. That it says that 

the father and mother will decide what city, same. 

The father and mother will jointly what country to 

live in, same. 

But suppose that there is no such decree; 

rather, the jurisdictional statutes of the nation, 

without considering this family, have a rule that says 

they have to live in Chile without Court permission. 

Is there any way I can draw a line, in terms 

of this statute, between the two situations, the one 

being where the divorce judge actually focused on the 

needs and circumstances of a family, the other being 

where there was no more than a jurisdictional law in a 

nation that tried to protect the jurisdiction of its 

courts?

with me about that, and since I thought you would 

agree with me about that, you would explain to me how 

I could reach that result, consistent with the 

language of this convention, which talks about custody 

rights granted by operation of law. 

MR. HAYS: Our position is that this does 

not give any sort of affirmative right to the father, 

and it is not a right to determine because, if you 

take the common usage of the right to determine, it is 

to make an affirmative decision, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Most courts in countries 

signatory of the treaty have come out the other way 

and agree that a ne exeat right is a right of custody, 

and those courts include the U.K., France, Germany --

I believe, Canada. Very few come out the way you --

remedies could -- could be used. There are -- there

remedies for access rights, which is what Mr. Abbott

Also, as was recognized by the State 

Department, when they sent their -- when they sent

the State Department recognized that there are 

mechanisms within the United States to enforce these 

orders, namely the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction 

and Enforcement Act that Mr. Abbott could avail 

himself of. 

And Mr. Abbott, in fact, did file an action

Turning to the -- the issues about -- the 

question of both “determining” and “the place of 

residence.” As, Justice Alito, you alluded, this is 

an international convention. The convention doesn't 

care if Mrs. Abbott moved with the child from one 

address in Chile to another. The convention cares 

very much when a child is abducted from one country to 

another. 

And as regards the definition of residence, 

it’s not defined in article 5(a), but it also appears 

in article 5(b), which refers to rights of access. It 

refers to the right to take the child to a place other 

than the child's habitual residence. And the drafting 

history on this point makes quite clear that this 

refers not only to the right to take -- take the child 

from the home, but to the right to take the child out 

of the country. 

In the convention context, the word 

"determine" can't have the decisive, unilateral 

meaning that Mrs. Abbott would attribute to it. The 

convention contemplates that rights will be held 

jointly and requires parents to work collaboratively. 

So in this case, the Abbotts, by virtue of the ne

exeat right, by virtue of the ne exeat statute, had a 

shared, enforceable right to determine whether their 

child would remain in Chile or would move somewhere 

else. 

And despite what Mr. Hays has argued and has 

argued in his brief, it is a substantive right. The 

parent who holds the right has the right to ensure 

that his child remains in the country of habitual 

residence, which has huge implications for the 

language and culture in which the child will be 

raised, and it ensures that the courts of Chile can 

resolve any disputes relating to the child. It’s 

certainly not a mere enforcement mechanism for Mr. 

Abbott's access right. 

With regard to the question of whether or 

not Mr. Abbott needed to have care and control of the 

child to invoke rights of custody, article 5(a) of the 

convention is what defines rights of custody. There 

is nothing in the text of that statute that requires 

the person invoking the convention to have physical 

care of the child. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Can we read that exception 

there to say -- "grave injury" and so forth -- can we 

read it as in essence saying, look, do what's best for 

the child?

MS. HOWE: That -- you could read that as a 

form of a best interests of the child standard. I 

believe that we would regard it as a little bit 

narrower and a grave risk of harm to the child or 

otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation. 

But it is a form of the best interest standard, 

certainly. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, do you 

agree with your opponent, putting aside removing the 

child from the country, that within Chile itself the 

custodial parent had the full right to determine the 

place of residence? 

MS. HOWE: We do agree, yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, I'm a 

little taken aback by your answer to Justice Breyer. 

You think the grave prosecution standard means 

whatever is the best interest of the child? 

MS. HOWE: No, I believe it's a stricter 

standard than simply the best interests of the child. 

It's the -- you know, it's a -- I believe it speaks 

for itself. It is a grave risk of psychological harm 

to the child. The convention --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you agree with 

what I understood to be the Solicitor General's 

position, that that’s an individual-specific and not a

culture-specific determination? 

MS. HOWE: Yes, we do. 

Article 13 is simply an affirmative defense 

to the -- once a judge has found that rights of 

custody exist and have been breached. There’s 

certainly nothing in the history of the convention 

that reflects any intent by the drafters to narrow the 

meaning of “rights of custody” through article 13. 

And finally, Mr. Hays cannot point to 

anything other than a single French trial court 

decision that holds squarely in his favor, and when 

that trial court decision was raised at the 1993 

Special Commission meeting, it garnered no support 

from the delegates. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
