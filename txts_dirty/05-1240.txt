 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Wallace versus Kato and Roy.

 Mr. Flaxman.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH N. FLAXMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FLAXMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 This case presents the Court with the 

question it addressed in Heck versus Humphrey raised in 

a slightly different context.

 The context in Heck was of a prisoner whose 

conviction had been affirmed who was in prison, who had 

filed a civil rights case that would have had the 

practical effect of collaterally challenging his 

criminal conviction. The context in this case is of a 

civil rights plaintiff who has prevailed in his criminal 

case, who was imprisoned for 8-1/2 years fighting the 

criminal case and comes to Federal court with a Section 

1983 action saying, I now seek a remedy for my 

unconstitutional incarceration, and files his lawsuit.

 The court in Heck held that this action, an 

action to recover damages for unconstitutional 

conviction or imprisonment, accrues when the conviction

is set aside. That's the principle that we asked the 

court of appeals to apply and the court of appeals said: 

We're not going to apply that because we will adopt a 

categorical rule without any implied exceptions 

whatsoever that says when you're arrested you have 2 

years, which is the statute of limitations in 1983 cases 

in Illinois, to file your claim for damages.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Flaxman, one starting 

point. You say that this case should be just like Heck, 

but in Heck the core problem was the line between 1983 

and habeas, right?

 MR. FLAXMAN: Well, that was one view of the 

core problem.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But at least this case 

involves no such concern about habeas.

 MR. FLAXMAN: That's correct. In Heck the 

Court solves the core problem by concluding -- by 

denying the existence of a cause of action for damages 

until the criminal case had been resolved in favor of 

the civil rights claimant, which is the rule, the common 

law rule for malicious prosecution. That's the solution 

that the Court came up with in Heck, which is the 

solution that the petitioner believes should be applied 

in this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But only if, only if the

challenged evidence, the challenge to the evidence, if 

sustained, would necessarily -- and this is the crucial 

language -- invalidate the criminal conviction.

 MR. FLAXMAN: That's what would have 

happened in this case, as the dissenting judge in the 

petition for rehearing --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would necessarily have? 

You could have said that ex ante?

 MR. FLAXMAN: Absolutely. In criminal cases 

there's discovery and the criminal defendant knows what 

the prosecution --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't know what other 

evidence there might have been in the criminal case. Ex 

ante you can't tell.

 MR. FLAXMAN: You do know because it's 

disclosed in discovery. We don't do trial by ambush any 

more in criminal cases. The defendant knew that all the 

evidence against him was the alleged --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but he did 

not know that for years later. I mean, they don't have 

to bring a prosecution immediately. They can wait until 

the day before the statute of limitations runs.

 MR. FLAXMAN: Well, there is no statute of 

limitations for murder in Illinois.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then they can

wait a long time.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. FLAXMAN: If he's incarcerated that 

whole time awaiting the filing of charges, then his 

cause of action would not have accrued. But the more 

likely scenario is that he would be arrested --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is that -- I mean, 

your friend on the other side says that the cause of 

action would have accrued at the moment at which he was 

bound over by the decision of an independent magistrate. 

At that point the false arrest and the incarceration 

incident to the false arrest is over and if there is 

ever going to be a claim for what happens next, I gather 

it'ss going to be a common law action for false 

imprisonment, and that, I guess, would not accrue until 

the imprisonment is over. But so far as the arrest is 

concerned, whatever whatever wrong is done, that wrong 

is completed at the point at which an independent 

magistrate takes over.

 MR. FLAXMAN: If the claim was solely 

directed at the arrest, then Your Honor would be 

absolutely correct. The claim in this case, the cause 

of action, is not that he was taken off the street 

without probable cause. The core of the cause of action 

is that the respondent police officers exploited that

arrest to get this untruthful confession that was used 

to hold Mr. Wallace in custody for 8-1/2 years, to seize 

him for 8-1/2 years. It's not just the arrest. It's 

the arrest plus exploiting it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But all of that occurred, 

as I -- correct me if I'm wrong on the facts, but I 

thought all of that occurred prior to -- I don't know 

what they call it in Illinois, but prior to a bind-over 

hearing or prior to the point at which the judiciary 

steps in, breaking the, as it were, the chain of 

causation between what the police do and the subsequent 

incarceration.

 MR. FLAXMAN: Under Malley versus Briggs, it 

doesn't break the chain of causation if we adhere --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but just as a factual 

matter is it correct -- is it correct as a factual 

matter that the confession that was given was a 

confession that was given before there was any judicial 

intervention, before he was brought before a magistrate?

 MR. FLAXMAN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. FLAXMAN: There was no other evidence 

presented to the magistrate or that could have been 

presented to the magistrate other than the confession to 

show --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Flaxman, is your 

argument limited to that situation, where there is no 

evidence whatsoever against the criminal defendant other 

than the illegally seized evidence? Or would it apply 

in some situations in which there is some additional 

evidence?

 MR. FLAXMAN: If there's some additional 

evidence, we could not say was necessarily -- would 

necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction. And 

would be -- that's not our situation.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Any additional evidence, 

even if it would be insufficient to support a 

conviction, takes -- makes make this -- would make this 

a different case.

 MR. FLAXMAN: I would not say -- well, it 

would make it a different case. But if I was arguing in 

a case where there was a little bit of evidence, but not 

enough to say there's probable cause to accuse him of a 

crime, I would say that suppressing or eliminating the 

confession would necessarily imply the invalidity of any 

conviction.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What, what does necessarily 

mean? Does it mean no additional evidence? Does it 

mean no additional evidence that is insufficient to 

support a conviction? Does it mean no additional

evidence that would be likely to persuade a trier of 

fact?

 MR. FLAXMAN: What I think it means is that 

there's no conviction -- what I think it should mean --

and I'm not trying to debate the dictionary, what I 

think it should mean is that if there is no evidence 

other than after -- that is excluded, to base a 

prosecution on, as in this case where the man is let go, 

because there is no evidence to prosecute him, that that 

does imply the invalidity of the conviction.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, in this case, let me 

just me more question on it. In this case, suppose 

there had been a witness who said at about the time when 

this murder took place, I saw somebody who was between, 

I would judge as between the age of 15 and 25, average 

height, average build, running away. And let's say that 

your client fits that description. Now would that be 

enough to take this case out of the rule that you're 

arguing for?

 MR. FLAXMAN: No. Unless that witness could 

say and the man who I saw then is the defendant in 

this -- is the criminal defendant, Mr. Wallace. There 

was an eyewitness in this case. And he could not make 

an in-court identification of Mr. Wallace. And the 

prosecutor realized that that wasn't enough evidence on

which to base a criminal prosecution, and gave up.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Again, you didn't, you 

didn't know that at the time the arrest was made, or at 

the time the confession was extorted, or at the time he 

was bound over. You really didn't know that until the 

trial. For all you knew, they might have found in 

addition to the confession, they might have found 

eyewitnesss who would have identified your client. You 

couldn't tell that until the trial.

 MR. FLAXMAN: Well, that would have been 

very unfair if they withheld -- they ambushed the 

defendant with --

JUSTICE ALITO: No, well -- until the trial 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Until the trial, until the 

process of trial began.

 MR. FLAXMAN: Well, we didn't know that 

because there weren't any, because this man didn't 

commit that crime. We are talking -- in the 

hypothetical, I think we should set, start with 

Mr. Wallace being an innocent man, who was arrested 

unlawfully, who gives an involuntarily -- an involuntary 

false confession. And on the basis of that is held for 

eight and a half years, finally wins the case, is set 

free, and then sues the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, but you presume in 

your last answer that other than that, there is an 

absolutely fair prosecution.

 MR. FLAXMAN: Other than the fact --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, why do we make 

that assumption when we start out with the allegation of 

a tort and a violation of the Constitution?  I don't 

understand.

 MR. FLAXMAN: Well, the tort is against the 

police officers who made an unlawful arrest and 

exploited it to get the evidence that was used to hold 

Mr. Wallace. The, the problem with saying that 

Mr. Wallace has to sue, as soon as he files his motion 

to suppress, he should have filed his Section 1983 

action, would produce a multitude of 1983 actions.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the fact --

suppose that there were even a more serious battery 

here, a broken limb or something. Would you have to sue 

for the damages for the battery right away? The police 

officers injured --

MR. FLAXMAN: No. If excessive force was 

used against somebody when they're being arrested, 

that's a claim that everyone agrees accrues at the time 

of the injury.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about this

case?

 MR. FLAXMAN: This case would necessarily 

impair the validity of the conviction. If --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But the conviction in Heck 

existed at the time of the alleged tort. And what Heck 

said is where you have an outstanding conviction, and 

you have a constitutional tort, you can't sue on that 

constitutional -- and where -- you cannot sue on that 

constitutional tort if the decision on the tort would 

effectively contradict your conviction. Until the 

conviction has been set aside.

 Well, this is not that situation. There was 

no outstanding conviction involved. So why did you have 

to wait?

 MR. FLAXMAN: Well, you had to wait because 

it would -- it would be a fruitless act to file the case 

while the case -- file a Federal case while the state 

criminal case was pending. But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm still, I'm still 

puzzled about my question. Suppose there's a battery 

resulting in a serious injury to the defendant.

 MR. FLAXMAN: That claim would --

JUSTICE KENNED: But there's other evidence 

and so forth. Can you sue for the battery at once?

 MR. FLAXMAN: You can sue and you have to

sue for the battery immediately.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why is that the situation?

 MR. FLAXMAN: Why is that different? 

Because this --

JUSTICE KENNEY: And -- or is it just 

because of the assumption that the conviction might 

stand anyway.

 MR. FLAXMAN: Well the conviction generally 

does stand with -- the battery generally has nothing to 

with the conviction.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if does, then you 

wait?

 MR. FLAXMAN: If it is an element of the 

offense, you wait. Or if it is an element of what could 

be the defense in a criminal case.

 But getting back to the Heck question, in 

Heck the court looked to the common law for the 

appropriate rule to apply to the cause of action that 

Mr. Heck was applying.

 If we look to the common law for the 

appropriate rule for Mr. Wallace, we don't come up with 

the Seventh Circuit's rule of immediate accrual. We 

come up with the rule --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the point, the 

whole point of Heck was to avoid 1983 becoming an end

run around habeas. But here you don't have that problem 

because you don't have any available relief under habeas 

under Stone versus Powell.

 MR. FLAXMAN: Well, we don't know before the 

criminal case starts whether Mr. Wallace will receive a 

full and fair hearing on his Fourth Amendment claim. 

And until we know that we don't say Stone versus Powell 

would bar a Fourth Amendment claim. We don't know that 

the state will give Mr. Wallace an attorney who can stay 

awake, who can file a motion, who knows that there is a 

Fourth Amendment, and Mr. Wallace might end up not 

getting a full and fair hearing and might have a valid 

claim cognizable with Federal habeas corpus that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there many cases in 

which the rule of Stone versus Powell is inapplicable 

for that reason?

 MR. FLAXMAN: No. But there are some. It 

is not a non-existent occurrence in.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What happens -- I'm trying 

to think of what the problem is for you. On January 1, 

your client's arrested unlawfully. Now suppose the rule 

was you have two years to file it, starting now. What 

is the problem for you? The problem is maybe in a year, 

or maybe less, the police start to prosecute him. In 

the meantime, your trial is going forward because you

filed it on time. So when they start to prosecute him, 

you don't yet know what's going to happen. And it could 

happen that he's convicted and you think it's illegal 

because of the arrest and necessarily so.

 And therefore you have to stop the trial, I 

guess, because of Heck.

 MR. FLAXMAN: The civil trial will be stayed 

pending the --

JUSTICE BREYER: That would work, I guess. 

They'd stop it and then they'd have to bring it -- you'd 

have to stop it and then you'd have to go through these 

other remedies and they you'd have to go back to it.

 MR. FLAXMAN: It would be on the district 

court's docket for ten years waiting the final --

JUSTICE BREYER: But that would work.

 MR. FLAXMAN: It would, well, it would be a 

horrible --

JUSTICE BREYER: A mess.

 MR. FLAXMAN: -- a horrible mess for the 

district court. It would not work because --

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose I modify it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why would it be a mess? I 

mean, it seems to me that the district court, once it is 

filed -- something is filed within the two year statute, 

the district court can tell virtually immediately

whether there are criminal proceedings that are yet to 

be held, and the district court can simply, it can 

simply stay further proceedings until those criminal 

proceedings are over. If there's a possibility of 

collateral attacks, the district court can simply say 

hey, are you going to file a collateral attack? And if 

the answer is yes, stay it further. If the answer is 

no, go ahead with it then. What's tough about that?

 MR. FLAXMAN: Well, the district judge will 

not allow a civil case to go forward because it would 

allow the criminal defendant --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's the premise of my 

question. But I mean it seems to me to be fairly easily 

administered.

 MR. FLAXMAN: Well, I mean, I, I shudder to 

think of 20,000 cases on district court dockets being 

stayed while criminal cases are being resolved.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: 20,000 might make me 

shudder. But we got one.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. FLAXMAN: We have one. The criminal 

defendant will be disinclined to file his civil rights 

case on time because it will be used against him in his 

criminal case to impeach his bias.

MR. FLAXMAN: It will impeach his bias. If 

he, when he testifies in the criminal case, he will be 

cross-examined, aren't you seeking money damage from the 

police officers? Don't you want to make money from this 

case? And the jury will consider that when they weigh 

the truthfulness of the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And don't you think that a 

civil action which necessarily has to be stayed, might 

be a basis for, for the court in the criminal case to 

limit that kind of cross-examination?

 MR. FLAXMAN: Not in the Circuit Court of 

Cook County. That cross-examination will occur every 

time a civil --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Are there appeals from the 

Circuit Court of Cook County?

 MR. FLAXMAN: There are appeals and.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, don't you -- don't 

you think ultimately you could get that issue resolved?

 MR. FLAXMAN: No. I am absolutely confident 

the Illinois courts at the highest level will say that 

is proper cross-examination.

I want to suggest a modification with this suit here.

You say you have to file within two years. But wait, 

you have -- we tolled the statute. If the person is 

arrested and charged, and convicted, for all the time 

that is going on, it is just tolled, equitably. And 

after the conviction, if he's acquitted, by the way, or 

he isn't arrested, the statute starts to run again.

 Now if he's convicted, as long as you have 

filed, proceeding to challenge the conviction, it is 

tolled.

 Now, would that -- that it seems to me would 

help every problem you have, and it would be called 

equitable tolling. And that's been suggested by judges 

in different forums and many states have it.

 And what's the problem? That just solves 

the problem, doesn't it?

 MR. FLAXMAN: Well, I have four answers. I 

hope I can get them out.

 If Heck instead of adopting a rule of 

accrual and denying existence of a cause of action had 

established the Federal tolling rule, saying that these 

causes of action are tolled while you're in custody, 

that would have solved the problem.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, well, we could 

do it in this case.

certainly can do it. It would require carving a hole 

into, into Tomiano with this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, it would 

require overruling our cases that say for tolling, your 

borrow state law --

JUSTICE BREYER: What cases require 

overruling?

 MR. FLAXMAN: Unless state law is 

inconsistent with Federal Board of Regents versus 

Tomiano, I think the Court could say that. The other 

thing that the Court should be aware of is that the 

Seventh Circuit, and I think four other circuits follow 

the common law rule that you can't have a 1983 action 

about a false arrest if you have been convicted of the 

charge on which you were arrested. So these cases would 

not be brought in the Seventh Circuit and the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it seems to me 

identical to the rule you are advocating but with one 

difference. The difference with the rule you are 

advocating is a judge who is going to be judge at time A 

with your first case, is going to have to guess whether 

it is in this case or not in this case necessarily 

related to some kind of challenge to conviction you're 

going to bring later if you happen to get convicted.

 MR. FLAXMAN: I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: There is no way to guess 

that.

 MR. FLAXMAN: I think tolling, a Federal 

tolling rule for this cause of action, while someone in 

custody although a criminal conviction is, has not been 

resolved in favor of the defendant, criminal defendant, 

would be an excellent solution.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And is there anything that 

you are aware of that it would be contrary to? I know 

there are cases that say you look to states but you only 

look to states where the state law is, in fact, 

consistent with the Federal right.

 MR. FLAXMAN: No, I think the Court could 

say without overruling anything that there, in this the 

state law does not fully reflect or protect the Federal 

rights at stake here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then you deny the 

officers the purpose you have for the reason you have 

statutes of limitation, which is repose. They are going 

to wait ten years instead of the two years to find out 

if they are going to have to answer any claim for 

damages.

 MR. FLAXMAN: Well, but the officers will 

also get the benefit of not being sued if there is a 

conviction based on the charge for which the person was

arrested. That case would not be brought, especially in 

the Seventh Circuit where there is no cause of action --

and it wouldn't be brought anywhere because there's no 

damages if you are arrested and properly convicted and 

serving sentence. Those cases just are not going to 

exist; the officers would have that benefit.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the Seventh 

Circuit said in -- quickly in passing that the damages 

would run only from the time of the allegedly unlawful 

arrest until the time of arraignment. That would, that 

would be the -- be all of your damages. If there wasn't 

an arraignment, whatever happens is not attributed to 

the seizure.

 MR. FLAXMAN: That's the Seventh Circuit's 

view about what the cause of action is, which goes back 

to what is the cause of action and when does it accrue? 

In the Seventh Circuit the cause of action starts when 

you're arrested and -- either at the time of arraignment 

of, as they said in a subsequent case, when there's a 

Gerstein probable cause hearing. In I think every other 

circuit, the cause of action doesn't end at the time of 

arraignment. It continues until the time that you're 

released from being in custody.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You asked us to take that 

case and we didn't.

MR. FLAXMAN: Well, I asked you to consider 

damages but I think -- as a question of damages, and 

there are many issues related to damages that would have 

been presented in question to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if that's the 

boundaries of the false arrest claim, then why does one 

happen later matter?

 MR. FLAXMAN: Well, the common law false 

arrest claim would allow damages up until the time you 

were released from the imprisonment, which is not at the 

time of --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Even on the basis of 

innocence?

 MR. FLAXMAN: Not for a false arrest. As 

long as you're not convicted. So malicious prosecution, 

you would --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The common law would give 

damages in a case like this in which the release was 

basically governed by a suppression which has nothing to 

do one way or the other with the innocence of that 

person?

 MR. FLAXMAN: That's correct. The common 

law element -- malicious prosecution requires that the 

innocence or grounds not consistent with guilt, but 

there's no such element in the common law false

imprisonment, which would accrue when you are released 

from being in prison, which would benefit Mr. Wallace in 

this case. When the Seventh Circuit talked about there 

are three alternatives that we have to choose from, the 

proof immediately, the case by case of when it accrues, 

or it only accrues at the end of the case, they didn't 

consider the fourth possibility of the common law rule 

that it occurs when the imprisonment ends.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What does somebody like 

Mr. Wallace do under your rule if he's in a jurisdiction 

where there's not a lot of discovery in criminal cases. 

He isn't going to know until trial whether his cause of 

action accrued sometime earlier or whether it waited.

 MR. FLAXMAN: But he's not going to file his 

civil rights claim until his criminal case is over, 

because he knows and his lawyer will tell him, that's 

going to hurt you in winning the criminal case, and you 

should be concerned about that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he's never going 

to know, in the case where there's no statute of 

limitations, he's never going to know when his criminal 

case is going to be over because he may never know when 

it's going to start.

 MR. FLAXMAN: Well, if Mr. Wallace had been 

arrested and released, he would have had two years from

when he was released to bring a civil rights action, 

that being false imprisonment

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what happens if 

he files a suit after one year and then after one year 

and 350 days he's prosecuted? His action accrued but 

then it didn't accrue?

 MR. FLAXMAN: Well, I would suggest that it 

would be the same as when someone is convicted of 

battery, and then 10 years later, the victim of the 

battery dies from the injury caused by the battery. 

There would be a second prosecution for murder that 

would not be barred from double jeopardy. I think 

that's Diaz versus United States. I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So his action 

accrued and maybe it's even over, but then it turns out 

when they bring the prosecution, it should have never 

have been brought because it never accrued.

 MR. FLAXMAN: No, I think he would have two 

actions. He'd have the action for being arrested and 

then he'd have the action later when the -- when he was 

seized because of the unlawful -- the fruits of the 

unlawful arrest.

 As a practical matter, though, those cases 

are going to arise even less frequently than the Stone 

versus Powell cases that are brought properly in Federal

 JUSTICE BREYER: That problem is solved too 

if you simply say bring it, day one, you are arrested, 

and if in fact before the statute of limitations 

expires, your client is brought to the court and is 

going to be prosecuted. Tolled. They don't need two 

actions.

 MR. FLAXMAN: A Federal tolling rule would 

solve these problems.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I want to be sure I 

understood your position with regard to Justice 

Kennedy's hypothetical where the defendant is arrested 

and excessive force is used by the police, they beat him 

up or something like that. When does that cause of 

action accrue?

 MR. FLAXMAN: At the time they beat him up, 

unless the beating up relates to an element of the 

offense.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Suppose that they had beat 

him up two or three times. The first time it didn't 

relate to it, but then they took him into the 

interrogation room and they beat him up again. What 

about that case?

 MR. FLAXMAN: If the beating up is -- if the 

beating up is related to, used to extort a confession

and the confession is used against him, then there would 

be a cause of action when the confession is used.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So there would be two 

causes of action?

 MR. FLAXMAN: Multiple causes, yes. There 

could be at least two.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would he have to sue on the 

first one right away?

 MR. FLAXMAN: If you want to get damages for 

being beaten up, I would tell my client to sue right 

away. I would also tell my client if he's being charged 

with a serious criminal crime offense, to wait until the 

criminal case is over, because it will hurt you.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Flaxman, before you 

save your time, I didn't understand why you're content 

with Justice Breyer's tolling situation, bearing in mind 

that the way he put it is, so long as the -- as the 

criminal case is commenced within the two-year statute 

of limitations, how does that help you when the statute 

of limitations has passed? Then there's no tolling.

 MR. FLAXMAN: But criminal cases are not 

commenced many, many years after the unlawful arrest, as 

a practical matter.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And two years doesn't seem 

to be unheard of.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENNA RUTH SOLOMON

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. SOLOMON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 Our submission this morning rests on the 

proposition that the victim of an unreasonable search or 

seizure has the right to sue as soon as that Fourth 

Amendment violation occurs. For purposes of accrual of 

that claim, it does not matter whether the victim is

subsequently prosecuted or whether he is subsequently 

convicted. Accordingly, petitioner's Fourth Amendment 

claim accrued for purposes of the two-year statute of 

limitations as soon as his unlawful arrest and detention 

occurred, and his lawsuit filed some nine years later is 

time barred. The claim accrued --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, just to get it 

straight at the beginning, what if the claim includes a 

Fifth Amendment claim for extorting a conviction and 

it's mixed up with a Fourth Amendment claim? What about 

that claim?

 MS. SOLOMON: I believe that the rule for 

the Fifth Amendment claim, I believe the Court's view in 

Chavez is that a coerced confession claim has as an 

element of the claim, the use of that claim at trial. 

So it would be our view if that is an element of the 

claim, that that claim would not accrue until trial.

 A claim --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the beating of 

the defendant?

 MS. SOLOMON: Exactly. A claim for 

conscience shocking techniques to obtain the confession 

or the excessive force to obtain the confession, both of 

those claims, and use of the confession at trial is not 

an element of those claims, and those claims would

accrue at the time of those acts, just like the Fourth 

Amendment rule that we urge in this case.

 Only where there is a trial right and use of 

some evidence at trial, suppression of evidence at 

trial, something of that order, if the trial right is 

implicated, that claim would not accrue until at trial. 

That is different from the Fourth Amendment claim, of 

course, because --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Miss Solomon, do I gather 

from your response to Justice Stevens about the Fifth 

Amendment claim, that under Chavez it wouldn't accrue 

until it is used at trial, is this case therefore a 

pleading slip on petitioner's part? That is, if he had 

alleged a Fifth Amendment claim based on the coerced 

confession, then he wouldn't have a statute of 

limitations problem?

 MS. SOLOMON: He brought two claims in his 

criminal case. He lost them both in the Illinois 

Circuit Court at the time of his suppression motion. He 

pursued only one of those on appeal to the Illinois 

Appellate Court, and the circuit court made findings 

that the confession was voluntary. So at the outset, 

there were problems with that claim going into Federal 

court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a puzzling feature

of it, too, because I thought at the end the second time 

around, the Court of Appeals held that the confession 

was no good.

 MS. SOLOMON: The Illinois Appellate Court 

overturned the conviction on the basis that it was 

obtained through use of a confession in violation of the 

Fourth Amendment only. The only findings that have ever 

been made regarding Mr. Wallace's confession, the 

voluntariness of the confession, were made in the 

Illinois Circuit Court, and the finding was that the 

confession was voluntary, that it was not coerced. That 

finding has never been reviewed. Petitioner did file 

both Fourth and Fifth Amendment claims in this civil 

case, but we did not assert statute of limitations to 

the Fifth Amendment claim for precisely the reasons that 

I indicated to Justice Stevens.

 And for that reason, although the question 

was presented in the petition, we did not acquiesce in 

the Fifth Amendment portion of question 1 of the 

petition, and the court did not grant the Fifth 

Amendment claim. So I do not believe -- a short answer, 

sorry -- I do not believe it was a pleading error. It 

is simply that that claim as the litigation developed is 

not before this Court now, but not through a simple 

pleading error. It is a far more weighty problem than

that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if the Fifth Amendment 

claim were before us, do I understand you to have said 

before that the Fourth Amendment claim of false arrest 

would also be subject to litigation as part of the Fifth 

Amendment claim or under the umbrella of the Fifth 

Amendment claim, so that the statute would not have run 

on that?

 MS. SOLOMON: I'm sorry. If I indicated 

that, I definitely misspoke. In our view, all Fourth 

Amendment claims except for those that do negate an 

element of the offense, and those are described in 

footnote 6 of Heck, with that exception, all Fourth 

Amendment claims should be regarded as accruing at the 

time that the act that actually violates the Fourth 

Amendment occurs.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well then, my question is 

going to be along the same lines. Suppose -- I assume 

this is a rather frequent case -- the confession is 

alleged to be the product of a beating. The two are 

merged. If we have to wait for the Fifth Amendment 

claim anyway, then as a matter of policy, matter of 

convenience, why don't we wait for the Fourth Amendment 

as well?

 MS. SOLOMON: Because the rule of accrual is

that the act -- the claim accrues when the plaintiff 

experiences an injury.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we're making up the 

rule of accrual, Ms. Solomon. I'm asking, if we have to 

wait for one, why not wait for the other?

 MS. SOLOMON: Well, with respect, Justice 

Kennedy, I don't believe the Court is making up a rule 

of accrual. I think those rules are quite well settled. 

Cases like Ricks and Chardon make clear, and the Fourth 

Amendment cases make clear that a Fourth Amendment 

violation, unlike the Fifth, where evidence is used at 

trial, the Fourth Amendment claim violation is fully 

accomplished at the time of the illegal search or 

seizure. Anything --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Who is the defendant in a 

Fifth Amendment claim? Is it the policemen who 

extracted the confession or is it the prosecutor who 

introduced it at trial, since that is the offense?

 MS. SOLOMON: Well, the prosecutor would be 

absolutely immune, of course.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MS. SOLOMON: And some of those cases are 

brought against the police officers. But, the reasons 

that would suggest a certain accrual date for the Fifth 

Amendment claim are very different from the reasons that

dictate the accrual of the Fourth Amendment claim at the 

time -- the only action the petitioner alleges violated 

the Fourth Amendment in this case was when his detention 

at the police station, which was consensual at the 

outset, became unconsensual, became involuntary at some 

point before he confessed.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if he had also brought 

a Fifth Amendment claim, your view as I take it would be 

as follows:

 Number one, his Fourth Amendment claim, the 

running of the statute, the Fourth Amendment claim would 

be unaffected by that, so that would have to have been 

brought within the two-year period.

 MS. SOLOMON: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Number two, I'm assuming, 

and this is what I want you to tell me whether my 

assumption is right -- I am assuming that if a Fifth 

Amendment claim were brought by -- no, strike the 

assumption.

 You, I take it, would -- let me ask a 

different question. I take it you would agree that so 

long as a criminal case was pending, that it would be 

sensible and maybe required for the court simply to 

abstain from any proceedings on the Fourth Amendment 

claim.

MS. SOLOMON: We do -- our position is that 

they do occur when they happen and they must be filed 

within the limitations, yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you would agree that 

the court, if there's a criminal case going on, I take 

it you would agree that the court should not proceed to 

trial in the 1983 action.

 MS. SOLOMON: If there is a Fourth Amendment 

claim being raised in the criminal case, and of course, 

it might not be, but that is a very easy --

JUSTICE BREYER: But that's the problem. I 

don't know if it is easy. It seems to me if you take 

your point of view, now, on January 1, some, let's call 

it an unconstitutional action allegedly. So, I don't 

want to distinguish for the moment between Fourth and 

Fifth. On January 1 the event occurs.

 Then you say you have two years to file your 

claim in the Federal court of a violation of 1983, for 

example.

 Then that happens. Let's say two months 

later they file it. The defendant files it. A month 

after that, there is a state criminal proceeding. Now, 

you're the Federal judge. What's supposed to happen? 

It sounds to me as if the judge sitting there, under 

your theory, is going to have to make a decision. He's

going to have to say now, is the kind of claim that's 

being argued in my court that the policemen did 

something unconstitutional, if I say that's correct, 

that the plaintiff wins, I have to go on to say does the 

correctness of that, there was a violation, mean that 

the conviction if there is a conviction in the state 

court later, will necessarily be vitiated. If the 

answer to that question is yes, he shouldn't go ahead; 

is that right?

 MS. SOLOMON: Justice Breyer, that is 

correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If that's 

correct, we're getting to exactly the same problem, 

whether we do it through a set of abstention rules, 

which we have to have Federal abstention rules or it 

won't be worked out properly, or we have to have Federal 

tolling rules.

 I don't see any way to get to a sensible 

result here without either having clear abstention 

rules, just as you say, having clear tolling rules, as I 

suggested before. Am I right? If I'm wrong, let me 

know why; and if I'm right, which do you prefer?

 MS. SOLOMON: I think those are essentially 

the two choices, with one caveat. We would call it an 

accrual rule as opposed to a tolling rule, for the

reason that this court has always respected the tolling 

rules that states have whereas accrual is a Federal 

question.

 But with that slight caveat, I do believe 

that those are the two main options. But I don't 

believe the Court should be indifferent as between them. 

There are very serious practical reasons weighing down 

on our rule, which is a rule of immediate accrual and 

filing not immediately, of course -- the case need only 

be filed within the period of the statute of 

limitations.

 Thereafter it might well be that some cases, 

maybe many cases, maybe nearly all cases, would need a 

stay of some sort while the Federal -- excuse me --

while the criminal case is ongoing.

 But that question, figuring out whether a 

stay is warranted in order to avoid interference with a 

ongoing state prosecution, is far easier to figure out 

than whether the evidence is the only evidence, whether 

it's critical evidence, whether there was other 

evidence.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose -- correct me if 

I'm wrong -- when the district court wants to determine 

if he should hold something in abeyance, this is not 

necessarily abstention; this is what courts always do

when there are multiple actions. Other action pending 

is a general ground for a court to stay its hand.

 MS. SOLOMON: That's exactly right, Justice 

Kennedy, and it's also --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose it would 

make a difference to the officers, a principle of 

equitable tolling. They don't know if they're going to 

be sued for 10 years, 12 years, however long. Under an 

accrual rule with a stay, they know whether they're 

going to be facing a civil action or not.

 MS. SOLOMON: That is the second major 

advantage that we see to our rule, Chief Justice 

Roberts.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If you do it with a stay, I 

mean, I see that disadvantage. If you do it with a 

stay, the Federal judge is going to have to sit there 

with the papers in front of him, look at that evidence, 

think what's going to happen in the trial at the 

criminal case which I'm not quite certain yet, and then 

make a determination. It sounds like a very difficult 

decision and it sounds like sometimes they'll get it 

wrong, sometimes they'll get it right. The defendant 

might be arguing two different things, you know, one in 

the state court to try to get them to go ahead, and the 

other to try to get them to go ahead in the Federal

court.

 What do you --

MS. SOLOMON: Accepting your earlier 

construct where there really are essentially two rules, 

we either delay accrual or we --

JUSTICE BREYER: If you delay accrual by 

tolling, you do have the disadvantage that in some 

instances the policemen won't know for quite a while 

whether the case is being brought. That's true; and in 

the other instance, he won't know for quite a while how 

the case is going to come out, which may be worse. But 

you don't have any uncertainty. You have no 

uncertainty. You would know once the man is released. 

It's no tolling. Once he's convicted, it's tolled. 

Then the conviction comes in. Not tolled until they 

bring a proceeding.

 MS. SOLOMON: The rule that we propose, 

which is immediate accrual coupled with a stay of some 

sort if the Fourth Amendment claim is being actively 

litigated in the state court at that time, has two 

advantages.

 The first is that it does serve the purposes 

that all statutes of limitations serve, which is it puts 

the defendant on notice you are now the defendant in a 

lawsuit, you should be marshalling your evidence, you

should be preserving your records, and you are not in 

repose.

 This Court has respected those as very 

important interests. They are absolutely not served by 

a rule of delayed accrual.  At the same time, the rule 

to allow a stay where necessary - as I indicated, it's 

not going to be all of the cases, and it's far easier to 

figure it out. The Federal district court figures it 

out by having the defendant, the criminal defendant, who 

is a plaintiff in his court, come in and is asked a 

question: Are you currently --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They're not going to 

waste a lot of time figuring out whether to grant a stay 

or not when you have a criminal prosecution pending in 

state court. I think in most cases -- I mean, it's not 

like they're looking for cases. They're going to say in 

most cases: Stay granted, come back when this is over. 

They don't have to be -- unlike perhaps the situation 

with an equitable tolling rule, it doesn't matter 

whether they're precisely right or wrong. I mean, if 

it's close enough just stay it, and it doesn't seem to 

me there's much prejudice from that.

 MS. SOLOMON: Well, that's correct, Your 

Honor, and we wouldn't have any objection to a rule 

that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't there this 

practical problem? I think what you say fits together 

beautifully with regard to the law, but isn't it true 

that this will give an incentive in every criminal case 

for the defendant to file a 1983 action. So we may 

multiply the number of Federal cases that are filed and 

then sit there while a criminal case proceeds.

 MS. SOLOMON: I think the assumption, Your 

Honor, should be that the number of cases is going to be 

the same either way. It's just a question of when are 

they filed and, moreover --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if your opponent's 

rule is adopted, they wouldn't file unless -- if they 

get convicted and the conviction stands up, the case 

would never be filed.

 MS. SOLOMON: Well, it's curious that they 

make that argument, because of course every victim of a 

Fourth Amendment violation has the right to damages for 

at least the invasion of their privacy, for the 

antecedent conduct between the time of arrest and 

charging. At a minimum, Mr. Wallace had that coming to 

him because he was, according to the Illinois appellate 

court, illegally seized.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The thing I just want you 

to comment on is, my thought is every person arrested

has a potential, and something follows and so forth, has 

a potential Fourth Amendment claim, even though he may 

not have one on the merits. It just seems to me that 

there's a potential here of an awful lot of what may 

turn out to be frivolous claims filed, but it would seem 

to be routine procedure for defense lawyers who want to 

make a suppression motion to say, well, I better file my 

1983 case at the same time. So you might get literally 

hundreds and hundreds of cases.

 MS. SOLOMON: With respect, Your Honor, 

we'll take that chance for the benefits that the statute 

of limitations does bring to the officer. And as far as 

the burden on the court, whether all cases are stayed or 

some cases are stayed, of course, we're content to have 

this Court or the district court handling the case 

figure that out.

 But the main point that I would make is that 

a rule of delayed accrual wholly undermines the purposes 

of the statute of limitations, and where the plaintiff's 

interest, the claimant's interests, can be served, as I 

indicated, at a minimum every victim of a Fourth 

Amendment violation has the right to some damages. That 

is actually precisely why we say that Fourth Amendment 

claims do not necessarily imply the invalidity of the 

conviction.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I had missed Mr. Flaxman's 

point that this would an advantage to the prosecutor to 

say, aren't you going to make a lot of money about this 

case? My initial reaction as the defense counsel, I 

would love that comment. I would tell the jury: Of 

course, it's our duty as counsel to point out that my 

client was beaten, he was terrified, he was beaten 

again, he had a false confession, and the damages we're 

not interested in; we'll get much more damages if you 

convict and we show this 15 years later because the 

policemen lied as they always do. You know, you hear 

it.

 MS. SOLOMON: It may be not in a --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But he has tried more of 

these cases than I have and he indicates this is a 

serious concern.

 MS. SOLOMON: He has tried way more of them 

than I have as well, and I can't speak to that 

specifically. It's not an argument that was ever made 

in the briefs. But again, I have no reason to believe 

that the Federal district court can't take account of 

whatever it needs to take account of in order to 

avoid --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. This is the Cook 

County. This is the Cook County court.

MS. SOLOMON: Yes. Yes, I understand. But 

all that has to happen, of course, is that the complaint 

be put on file in the Federal court. It's notice 

pleading. It can be a very, very long complaint.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but he says the fact 

of the complaint the prosecutor's going to use in order 

to show that they're trying to profit from a false claim 

of a beating.

 MS. SOLOMON: Well, but as I indicated, 

every victim of a Fourth Amendment rights, even those 

who are guilty, even those who are convicted -- that's 

the Herring case. Herring exactly shows --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but the point is if 

the complaint is filed then the prosecution can makes 

that point.

 MS. SOLOMON: I would imagine that it would 

cut both ways in many cases, Your Honor. I'm sorry, I 

can't speak to it more specifically than that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does your position in 

this case leave any reason at all for equitable tolling?

 MS. SOLOMON: It does, Your Honor, 

absolutely. Equitable tolling is always available in an 

extraordinary case when the plaintiff could not put a 

complaint on file within the period of the statute of 

limitations. And unlike the accrual question, as

indicated a moment ago, the tolling is governed by the 

states. In this case, for example, because Mr. Wallace 

was only 15 years old at the time of the arrest, his 

claim was tolled. He actually had nearly four years 

beyond the two-year statute of limitations to put a 

complaint on file and it still would have been toll --

would have been timely. He filed outside even that 

time.

 Illinois does not toll for prisoners, but 

many states do, as the Court indicated in the Hardin 

case. So there's all sorts of tolling available, or 

could be under state law. Mr. Wallace has actually 

never urged tolling in this case and I assume that 

that's because there is no basis for that under state 

law. He did get the advantage already of the time when 

he was a minor and there is no other basis under 

Illinois law that would allow him any basis for tolling.

 But of course, tolling is proper when the 

plaintiff does not know and could not know that his 

rights were violated. If Mr. Wallace was illegally 

seized, he was right there when it happened. He might 

not have known that a court would ultimately accept his 

argument on that, but of course the plaintiff never has 

a right to be told that he has a successful claim before 

he brings that claim.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any remedy that 

Illinois law provides for a case like this where a 

person spends, what was it, eight years in prison and is 

ultimately released because the state never had enough 

evidence to try him in the first place?

 MS. SOLOMON: In many cases, the state law 

of malicious prosecution will provide a remedy. Of 

course, in Illinois and in all states, it requires 

favorable termination. In this case, of course, 

petitioner conceded long ago that he cannot show 

favorable termination because the circumstances under 

which the criminal case ended did not -- were not 

consistent with a favorable termination.

 But, of course, he would have had a Fourth 

Amendment claim if he had filed it timely. He would 

have had a state law malicious prosecution claim if he 

had been able to show favorable termination. In states 

that don't have malicious prosecution, perhaps there 

would be a due process claim as well.

 The result that there are no damages 

available to somebody when the conviction is overturned 

solely by operation of the exclusionary rule, however, 

should not be troubling because the conviction itself, 

of course, was not an independent violation of the 

Constitution. Petitioner did receive the benefit of the

exclusionary rule. His conviction was overturned. 

We're not aware of any case indicating that deterrence 

purposes would require both the exclusion of evidence 

and a damages claim.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it ever be proper 

for a district court to insist on proceeding to the 

merits of the claim, to dispose of the merits of the 

claim, while the prosecution was pending? Suppose the 

district court thought that it was seeing too many of 

these claims and it wanted to get to the bottom of them?

 MS. SOLOMON: Well, in our experience the 

district courts don't tend to want to go ahead. But I 

would suppose that if the -- if the court did, rules of 

comity are sufficient to allow the state courts to have 

the first crack at issues that are arising in the 

criminal cases, to be the ones that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: We haven't written about 

that other than in Heck explicitly and implicitly, and 

in Younger? That's about it?

 MS. SOLOMON: In Heck and in Younger. 

There's the concurrence in Deacons against Monahan 

indicates that a claim for damages should be stayed and 

not dismissed or gone forward with. Justice White's 

concurrence specifically addressed the difference 

between dismissing and going forward with the claim. Of

course, the footnotes 8 and 9 in the Heck opinion are 

very powerful indications of the weighty reasons. We 

have no reason to think that the district court would 

want to charge ahead with a claim that would -- with a 

case that will only get simpler if it waits for the 

state court proceedings to conclude, as well as of 

course the comity and respect for the state courts.

 In this case, of course, as I mentioned, 

the -- Mr. Wallace always had a claim available to him 

for his initial seizure regardless of the outcome of his 

criminal prosecution. If he wanted to seek damages for 

that prosecution and our primary submission, part one of 

our brief is even assuming those damage might be 

available on a Fourth Amendment claim, he was 

nevertheless obligated to bring that claim within the 

period of the statute of limitations, because otherwise 

it would be time barred.

 In our view, petitioner does not have 

one claim for that arrest and another claim for his 

trial and prosecution. He has one claim for a Fourth 

Amendment violation with two elements of damages. But 

mounting future or delayed damages do not delay accrual. 

Even where the plaintiff does not know the full extent 

of his injuries, he still must sue within the period of 

the statute of limitations.

In fact, petitioner does not cite a 

single case including the ones newly arrived in the 

reply brief that uses either his accrual rule or his 

damages rule to award damages for the entire time of a 

lengthy period of incarceration. And as I indicated 

petitioner conceded long ago that he cannot show 

favorable termination. And although he could have 

obtained some damages had he brought his claim timely, 

his claim did accrue he was seized and not when the 

charges --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you agree with Judge 

Wood that the limitation on damages would be from the 

period, from the time of the arrest until the 

arraignment? That would be the measure and nothing 

after?

 MS. SOLOMON: A number of courts have 

reached that result, Your Honor. Footnote 25 recites 

five court of appeals decisions to that effect. But our 

primary submission in this Court is that regardless of 

the damages that are available on a Fourth Amendment 

claim, that the mounting of damages did not delay 

accrual, and without a timely claim, it doesn't matter 

what damages the plaintiff is seeking.

for unconstitutional conviction, we take to be a

shorthand for a claim of some sort of constitutional 

violation that can be brought through the vehicle of 

Section 1983 that would enable the plaintiff to recover 

damages for the incarceration. 1983 of course itself 

does not create any substantive rights. The plaintiff 

needs an underlying claim and in this case of course the 

plaintiff only has the Fourth Amendment claim.

 We do have, in our brief and argument why 

the Fourth Amendment should not be regarded as allowing 

those damages, but our primary submission and we do 

think the Court can decide the case without -- without 

reaching that issue.

 The only date to delay an accrual in this 

case was the date that the charges were nol prossed. 

But that date is meaningless for the Fourth Amendment 

and it is therefore meaningless for accrual. We would 

the judgment be affirmed.

what is Mr. Wallace's cause of action? Is it a cause of 

action for being seized until he was arraigned? Or is 

it a cause of action for being seized for the eight and 

a half years that he was locked up until he was, the 

criminal case was resolved in his favor?

 My sister argues that it was just, the 

Federal remedy is only until you're being arraigned, and 

that the state remedy for malicious prosecution doesn't 

exist if the Seventh Circuit has construed Illinois law 

to say that there is no malicious prosecution when you 

win the Federal case, when you win the criminal case, 

because the evidence has been suppressed. The false 

imprisonment, state false imprisonment was dismissed by 

the district court, under his reading of Illinois law 

that the cause of action accrued at the time of the 

arrest. Not at the time he was released. And the 

Seventh Circuit when that issue was raised on appeal to 

them in a brief by both sides chose to reject it without 

discussion.

 What, the cause of action that respondent 

proposes is none, for the eight and a half year seizure. 

There is no state cause of action in Illinois. And 

there is no Federal cause of action. It is just tough. 

You are seized for eight and a half years, and you can't 

go to state court, you can't go to Federal court. You

should have sued immediately after you were arrested to 

get a little bit of damages, but that's all you can get. 

And have a nice day; we're sorry.

 That, I don't think is consistent with Heck. 

I don't think it is consistent with this Court's 

jurisprudence about the meaning of Section 1983. I 

don't think it is consistent with the Fourth Amendment 

and it should not be the rule that the Court adopts.

 The statute of limitations problem isn't 

really a problem because all of the evidence that's 

material to the legality of the arrest, to the legality 

and the -- whether the confession was the proximate --

was proximately caused by the arrest or proximately 

caused by the incarceration, has been developed in the 

criminal case. When there's very strong interest in 

seeing that the facts are fully determined and fairly 

determined for both sides. It is not that the police 

officer who sued eight -- eight and a half years later 

is much less is much less prejudiced than Mr. Wallace 

is, who comes out of prison after eight and a half years 

with no remedy.

 The questions about the multiple causes of 

action that can arise: if you're beaten, you have to 

sue immediately after you're beaten; if you're beaten 

but a confession is extorted from you, your right to sue

trial -- and if there's some constitutional violation 

which necessarily impairs the conviction, then you can 

sue after you successfully defended a criminal case --

is really an administrative nightmare that really could 

be solved by a Federal tolling rule that all Section 

1983 cases are tolled; the statute does not start to run
