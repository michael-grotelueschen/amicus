 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in 06-427, Tennessee Secondary School 

Athletic Association versus Brentwood Academy.

 Ms. Mahoney.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN MAHONEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 If this Court adheres to its State action 

ruling, it should now hold that the TSSAA has broad 

discretion to adopt and to enforcement contractual 

restrictions on athletic recruiting as a condition of 

membership. Under this Court's cases, Brentwood cannot 

escape the contractual bargain it's made under the First 

Amendment, because the association offered it a 

reasonable choice as measured by the three criteria that 

this Court has used to identify unconstitutional 

conditions.

 First, participation in the state 

tournaments is entirely voluntary. Second, the 

restrictions at issue here are germane to the legitimate 

goals of the association. And third, enforcement of the 

rule here imposed only a minimal burden on speech of

private concerns.

 I would like to turn first to the issue of 

voluntariness, because that's a core issue in every case 

involving allegedly unconstitutional conditions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you a 

preliminary question, Ms. Mahoney?

 And that is, we are told that at the time 

this issue arose, the practice itself was all right, and 

it was all right for one school to invite students from 

another school to join the invitee school's practice. 

And now I take it that it's no longer permissible, that 

one school's, one school's practice, is reserved for its 

own students and not -- others are not invited. But if 

it was permissible under the association's rules to 

invite students from other schools, then why is it 

impermissible to talk it up? I mean, you can do it, but 

you can't talk about it?

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, actually the 

record indicates that it would be permissible to give 

the information about the date for the spring practice 

to the students who had signed an enrollment contract. 

And that's at CAJA-705. It could have been sent in an 

enrollment packet, for instance. It could have been 

sent just as a schedule.

 But instead the problem here was that it was

sent from the coach in a personal solicitation to the 

students that really subtly pressured them to come to 

practice. This was a form of recruiting. Under 

question 3, which is the interpretive guidance for the 

recruiting rule, it very expressly says that 

coach-initiated contact with students who are enrolled 

at another school is not supposed to occur. And so this 

fell within the terms of the rule. As the Sixth Circuit 

said, it would strain credulity to say that Brentwood 

didn't know that it shouldn't have sent this letter. 

And their own headmaster acknowledged that it certainly 

should have been t kind of thing that they would have 

called about before doing it, and he was surprised that 

Coach Flatt had not done so.

 So I think, Your Honor, that the first point 

is that, yes, this information could have been 

communicated to the students, but not in this way. And 

certainly the association could recognize that this was 

still a form of recruiting.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So in speech terms, there 

were alternative means to get the message out.

 MS. MAHONEY: Absolutely. This was speech 

of private concern. It was about the time for football 

practice. And there were other ways that that 

information could be communicated. But the association

has an interest in having prophylactic rules that 

prevent coaches from initiating communications with 

students before they started school, because even though 

they --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think the briefs are --

I think it's fair to characterize the Respondent's brief 

this way, or fair to concentrate on Pickering. It seems 

to me that Pickering is the key here, and I took away 

that impression from your brief.

 If we said that it's commercial speech, I 

think that's a little far off the mark. If we said it's 

an unconstitutional condition, I'm not sure that helps 

either side that much, either.

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think Pickering 

is really an example of an unconstitutional conditions 

analysis just in the employment context. What the Court 

really says in a broad group of cases where the 

government or the State actor is not exercising 

sovereign power, if it's offering a benefit, if it's 

using funding to encourage activity, if it is engaging 

in a contractual relationship as it does in Umbehr, that 

what this court has said in Umbehr very explicitly is 

that when the government uses contractual power the 

constitutional concerns are not as great.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In Umbehr we said, the

Court said, that in the independent contractor cases the 

interests of either party, the government or the 

contractor, are not quite so intense as they are with a 

public employee. I thought that made sense when I read 

it. I'm not so sure it does any more.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, and in fact this Court 

said in Umbehr that, even though the interests were what 

different, the standards that had been applied in 

Connick and Pickering could easily accommodate the 

circumstances of dealing with --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose we could 

construct a hypothetical where we could say there's a 

very strong interest in the contractor. So I'm not sure 

that that works as a general theorem.

 MS. MAHONEY: But I think that the key from 

all the cases, whether we look at Cornelius, which 

involves your access to the charitable campaign, or if 

we look at or if we look at Lusk and American Library, 

which involved access to funding, or Grove, access to 

funding, that the strain across these cases is that 

you're really looking at is the restriction germane. 

What kind of a burden --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about if, what 

if the association had a rule that members, school 

officials, shall not criticize the decisions of the

association?

 MS. MAHONEY: I think then it would be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's germane. In 

other words, you can criticize other things, but if 

you're going to join this group we think it's important 

for their public stature not to be criticized by 

members.

 MS. MAHONEY: I think that would probably be 

viewed as speech of public concern, and at that point 

under Connick balancing you'd have --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no more 

public concern about when spring practice is. If you 

think there should be, you know, two playoff tiers 

rather than three and you criticize the association for 

that and they say well, you're suspended for a year and 

all that.

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, in Connick this 

Court said that in assessing whether something is a 

issue of public concern you look at not just the topic, 

but also the way in which that topic is discussed. And 

if what happened was the association decided that it was 

going to penalize a member or have a broad rule that 

says it would tolerate no criticism and even if 

Brentwood had taken an ad out in the paper to talk about 

how terrible the association's policies were, I think

this Court could readily find that that was not a 

reasonable choice because it would impact --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about 

criticizing officials?

 MS. MAHONEY: On the field, Your Honor? I 

think that the interests in essentially controlling that 

kind of speech would always outweigh the interests of an 

athlete or a coach in engaging in any kind of speech on 

the field.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I mean three 

days later, you know, the school -- the coach writes an 

editorial saying there were lousy calls in the game last 

week.

 MS. MAHONEY: I think that would probably be 

treated as speech of public concern, which would then 

give rise to Connick balancing.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And how would you balance 

it?

 MS. MAHONEY: What Connick says is you look 

at how core is the speech, what's it about?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And how would you 

commence?

 MS. MAHONEY: Probably find that that not be 

a reasonable restriction, that it's probably not germane 

to the important educational goals of the association.

But it could -- I mean, I think that what we have here 

is the recruiting rule has been applied to speech that's 

a private concern that can be delivered in another way; 

and the choice to join is entirely voluntary.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Ms. Mahoney, on that point, 

can I just take you back to square one for a second? 

I'm with you in your explanation that the speech at 

issue here probably was fairly understood as being for, 

you know, the communication here as being a violation of 

the rule. Could you, though, tell me, would it have 

been -- I guess I have two questions.

 Would it have been a violation of the rule 

if the coach had sent the letter to eighth grade 

students in the school itself, those who were already 

formally enrolled and who might be going out for 

football the next fall? And number two, what is exactly 

the interest in preventing recruiting, as you describe 

it, when the letters are aimed at people who have 

already signed, I think you referred to it as, an 

enrollment contract? So there's every reason to believe 

they're going to be in that school next year.

 What is the interest? And would that 

interest have supported a ban on letters to the already 

enrolled eighth grade kids?

 MS. MAHONEY: First, I think that this

letter, which was not sent to Brentwood's own eighth 

grade middle school students, probably could have been, 

because under the rule those students were not enrolled 

at another school. And what is really restricted is 

coach-initiated contact with students enrolled at 

another school.

 This letter was instead sent to student 

whose were still enrolled at another school. And the 

interest I would --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, so they had signed 

up to go to Brentwood. So where does the recruiting 

come in?

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, the contracts 

weren't binding. We have the contracts in the record at 

CAJA-1889. But more importantly, whether it was or not, 

the record demonstrates that some student do sign 

multiple contracts. Some students do not come. And so 

efforts to get, of the coach, to get them to come to 

practice, to be with him, to entice them, to give them 

his personal home phone number, that's still a form of 

recruiting.

 In fact, one of the top basketball athletes 

in the eighth grade in the city of Nashville in the 1997 

was named Jack West Curry. He signed one of these 

contracts. He did not ultimately come to Brentwood.

And yet he was exactly the kind of person that still 

could have been subject to recruiting if during that 

period --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So it boils down to saying 

that when they've signed the enrollment contract that's 

not the end of the, in effect, the issue.

 MS. MAHONEY: No.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And there is a sensible 

practical way in which recruiting goes on even among 

those who have signed up. Okay.

 MS. MAHONEY: It certainly could, and so 

there's an interest in stopping that. This Court 

certainly has said that even in the commercial speech 

area, in Ohralik instance, that it's fineto have 

prophylactic rules as long as the rule continues to 

advance the interest. The fact that the interest may be 

less strong at the point when they sign an enrollment 

contract doesn't mean there is still no legitimate 

interest.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what is the 

interest behind the anti-recruiting rule?

 MS. MAHONEY: Several, Your Honor. This is 

a group of individuals involved in an educational 

activity in the State of Tennessee, and they have 

determined that athletic recruiting is harmful to young

adults, that it puts too much emphasis on athletics, 

that it also --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They could have 

determined that it's particularly harmful to the public 

schools who don't have the option of recruiting while 

the private schools do?

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, in 1997 

there were five violations, five penalties for 

violations of the recruiting rule, and four of them were 

against public schools, one against a private school. 

That's at the transcript at 2705. Public schools have 

to bear the burden of these rules because they do try to 

recruit.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the association bar 

Brentwood from contacting public school students 

altogether?

 MS. MAHONEY: About anything? I think again 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: About enrollment. About 

enrollment.

 MS. MAHONEY: I think, Your Honor, that it 

would be hard to say that that is germane, and it would 

also put a very large burden on speech if they imposed a 

flat contact. They've done nothing of the kind. There 

have been --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, like if Brentwood, 

let's assume -- I think it's true -- is rather 

well-known in the State, and if they send you a 

solicitation form to enroll, everybody knows they've got 

a great athletic program, so we say you can't solicit 

any high school students.

 MS. MAHONEY: I think that they haven't done 

it. It would certainly be far less reasonable. I 

don't -- I think that that would be much more of a 

burden on speech.

 Here it's undisputed -- I shouldn't say it's 

undisputed, but the record certainly establishes, that 

academic targeting is not prohibited -- that's in the 

transcript at 2202 -- that if Brentwood Academy or any 

other school wants to initiate contact for the purpose 

of trying to persuade them to come for academics, it's 

entirely free to do so. This rule is not designed to in 

any way stifle those kinds of communications.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I haven't kept track of 

your time, but if we're going to rule for you we have to 

reach the due process problem. And at some point after 

you finish discussing what you wish to on free speech, I 

actually find that a somewhat more difficult issue.

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, if I could just --

one thing I do want to make clear about the

voluntariness of the choice and then I'll turn to due 

process, is that, as we set out in our brief, one of the 

things that Brentwood and some of its amici have tried 

to say is that there simply is no ability to play 

scholastic sports in Tennessee if you're not a member of 

this association. And it's important to emphasize that 

for regular season play, for instance, members of TSSAA 

are free to play any non-member schools they want.

 It used to be that the association required 

approval, which was routinely granted. But in 2005 they 

actually changed the rule. It's in the handbook at page 

23 on their website.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then that's part of 

the trophy, whatever it is when you win at the end of 

the year.

 MS. MAHONEY: That's right, Your Honor. You 

could have -- all that TSSAA does is give the 

opportunity to engage in its State tournaments, 

post-season competition.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any other?

 MS. MAHONEY: Yes, Your Honor. There is a 

Christian Athletic League that has 26 private schools, 

that also conducts State tournaments. There are also 

State tournaments in other sports, including lacrosse, 

swimming, that are not run by TSSAA. And there's

nothing to stop Brentwood, for instance, from trying 

form its own league, which is what independent schools 

have done in many other States. They also could have 

regular season play with TSSAA member schools and have 

invitationals. There's no bar on schools attending 

those.

 If I could quickly turn to Justice Kennedy's 

question with respect to the issue of due process. I 

think that the analysis is really quite similar. What 

occurred here is a contractual agreement to provide 

certain kinds of process which actually satisfy the 

standards in Laudermill, but in addition Brentwood would 

have been able to bring a beach of contract action under 

State law if it wanted to allege that it didn't get the 

notice that the contract required. And this Court held 

in Lujan that you have to take into account the 

availability of a State breach of contract action before 

jumping to the conclusion that due process rights have 

been violated. Yet the Sixth Circuit did not take that 

into account.

 If I could save the remainder of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Ms. Mahoney.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The position of the United States is that 

the court of appeals applied the wrong standard in 

deciding Brentwood's First Amendment claim. This 

Court's decisions establish that when the government 

offers a benefit that a citizen is free to reject, it 

has much greater leeway in regulating speech than when 

it exercises its coercive sovereign power. As in cases 

where the Government acts as an employer, a contractor, 

a property owner, a service provider or a benefactor, 

the TSSAA offers a benefit, access to organized athletic 

competition, that a school may decline by choosing not 

to become a member of the association.

 Brentwood's First Amendment challenge to 

the TSSAA recruiting rule, therefore, is subject to 

deferential review. Deferential First Amendment review 

is appropriate in these contexts because the Government 

occupies a middle ground when it is not exercising its 

sovereign authority. On the one hand the Government 

remains the Government no matter what authority it's 

exercising -- so it is subject to the restrictions of 

the First Amendment.

On the other hand, when the Government acts 

in a non-sovereign capacity, its position is comparable 

to that of private sector entities and it has to be able 

to make the same sorts of decisions that they make. It 

has to be able to decide what conduct is acceptable in 

its workplace, what activities may take place on its 

property, and the uses to which its grant money may be 

put.

 So the First Amendment can't apply with the 

same force as when the Government acts in its sovereign 

capacity. For example, a government agency can tell its 

employees not to use offensive language with co-workers 

or customers, as Justice O'Connor pointed out in her 

plurality opinion in Waters versus Churchill, and that 

prohibition would not be subject to heightened First 

Amendment scrutiny. So, too, an athletic association 

can tell the students at its member schools that they 

can't use offensive language in dealing with opposing 

players or referees, as indeed the TSSAA bylaws in fact 

do. This is at page 202 of the joint appendix. And 

that prohibition should not be subject to heightened 

First Amendment scrutiny either. The same is true of 

other rules that govern membership in and define the 

character of a voluntary athletic association.

 As applied to TSSAA's recruiting rule, the

deferential standard of review is easily satisfied. 

Prohibiting the use of undue influence in recruiting or 

attempting to secure or retain high school athletes we 

think is self-evidently reasonable in light of the 

purposes underlying the rule, which include preventing 

the exploitation of children and ensuring that sports 

remains subordinate to academics.

 Prohibiting coaches from contacting students 

who have not enrolled at the coach's school is likewise 

reasonable. Either because that prohibition can 

reasonably be reviewed as an instance of undue influence 

itself, or because it is a reasonable prophylactic 

measure to prevent the exertion of undue influence.

 And finally defining enrollment in the 

context of the prohibition on coaches contacting 

students to exclude the situation where a student has 

somehow announced its intention -- announced his 

intention to attend its school, for example, as in this 

case by signing an enrollment contract, is reasonable as 

well for the reasons Ms. Mahoney mentioned in responding 

to Justice Souter's question. Somebody who signs an 

enrollment contract may not decide -- may ultimately 

decide to attend a different school, and there is 

evidence in the record that students sometimes sign 

multiple enrollment contracts and sometimes decide to

attend a different school after signing one. This is at 

page 240 of the joint appendix and there are additional 

citations to the record on page 6 of the reply brief.

 In short, while the First Amendment has a 

role to play in this case and cases like it, it is a 

very limited role. And the recruiting rule easily 

satisfies what we think is the appropriately deferential 

standard of review that applies in circumstances of this 

type. The judgment of the court of appeals should be 

reversed.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this, what is 

your response to the, one of your earlier questions. 

Suppose they sent out a general brochure to all the 

graduating grammar school students to -- advertising 

that they come up to Brentwood and so forth and so on, 

and the rule prohibited that? Would that rule be valid?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: I think that would be close 

to the line, Justice Stevens. The -- the prohibition on 

coach contact we think is an easy case. There are, in 

fact, ways that schools can communicate --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't the coach 

recruiting just a subcategory of a broader --

MR. HIMMELFARB: No. If it is a brochure 

sent out by the school generally and it doesn't target 

specific students and it went out to schools generally,

and there was a prohibition on that type of thing, I 

think that might very well be a reasonable restriction 

on speech. As I say, I think this that's close --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry; you think 

it might be a reasonable or unreasonable?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: It might be -- well, I 

think it's close enough to the line that it could go 

either way.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a close call 

whether a school can send a brochure to 8th graders that 

is not limited to athletics telling them about their 

school?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, the -- in that 

situation, I think -- I think it probably would be 

unreasonable, Mr. Chief Justice.

 The, the -- the methods of -- the 

alternative methods of speech here are not all that 

different -- that are allowed by the rule here -- are 

not all that different from Justice Stevens' 

hypothetical. There are a number of ways in which 

schools can communicate with prospective students and 

their families about athletics at the school, but it's 

usually done through intermediaries. And I think as I 

say, Justice Stevens' hypothetical is not --

was limited to people who had signed contracts with --

students, not just football players but everyone who 

else had signed enrollment contracts with the school? 

General brochure listing all the things you can do at 

the school including athletics, including -- you know, 

other extracurricular activities? Is that all right?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or would it be 

unreasonable for the TSSAA to prohibit that?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: I think that would be much 

more problematic. And I don't -- I don't think that 

this rule prohibits that. And I don't think it 

prohibits Justice Stevens' example.

 What the rule allows is for schools to send 

out information about their athletic programs to other 

schools to distribute to their students, for example. 

It also allows them to send it out to real estate 

brokers, to athletic leagues that aren't associated with 

the school, to advertise. It allows it to respond to 

direct inquiries from students.

 But I think Justice Stevens' hypothetical 

and your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, are pretty 

close to the sorts of things that are allowed by this 

recruiting rule. And I do agree with you that --

the school for the rule. I'm trying to figure out 

what's the scope of the First Amendment protection.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Right. I -- I -- I think 

that if the, if the -- if the recruiting rule -- if 

there were a recruiting rule that prohibited those types 

JUSTICE STEVENS: You do agree at some point 

the First Amendment would prohibit some kind of rule.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Of course. There is, we 

think there is a reasonableness or germaneness 

limitation. The justifications for the rule are mainly 

preventing the exploitation of students and ensuring 

that academics -- that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that permissible, in 

weighing the -- both sides of the equation to consider 

the advantages -- I mean the justifications for the 

speech?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Sure. Under -- under a 

reasonableness standard, I think it is appropriate to 

look at the justifications for the rule and ask whether 

if the -- the rule reasonably furthers those interests. 

And, and in making that determination --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- justification for the 

rule in this case and the justification for the rule 

that would prohibit the general solicitation I

described.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is it the same 

justification, but the justification is a little 

stronger in one hypo than the other?

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Right. I think you, if you 

-- if you offered those justifications for banning the 

type of speech you suggested, it might very well be that 

it would be appropriate to conclude that the rule isn't 

reasonably related to those justifications because it 

burdens too much speech.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that, 

turning to the state action for a moment, one of the 

justifications for finding state action that is there is 

no other real choice, that they have, other than to --

if they want to play athletics in Tennessee other than 

to join this association.

 And yet at the opening of your argument, you 

said oh, well it's voluntary. So It seems to me that 

your speech argument is inconsistent with one of the 

justifications for finding state action to begin with.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, no, I don't think so, 

Justice Kennedy. In the types of cases that I mentioned 

at the outset, employment cases, funding cases, 

property, ownership cases, I mean there's no dispute

that in those cases the Government is a state actor. 

When the Government employs people it is a state actor 

subject to the First Amendment, but deferential review 

is applied to First Amendment challenges because there 

is a choice.

 And so too here there is a choice for the 

reasons mentioned by Ms. Mahoney. There are other 

athletic associations that schools can join.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's somewhat 

inconsistent with one of the most forceful arguments for 

finding state action to begin it, i.e., that you have to 

join the school if you really want to compete with most 

of the schools. You have to join the association.

 MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, I think -- I'm not 

sure that's true, Justice Kennedy. But I think it's 

clear that in this Court's decisions in various areas 

applying deferential First Amendment review, when 

there's a voluntary relationship between the Government 

and the citizen, that is precisely the reason that the 

Court applies deferential review.

MR. BLUMSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 I represent Brentwood Academy in this civil 

rights case.

 It's about the regulatory overreaching of 

the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association, 

what we call the TSSAA. The case involves the First 

Amendment's interest of the school, its students, its 

parents, and the procedural due process interests.

 Brentwood was severely punished, and the 

punishment is listed in footnote 5 of our brief, for 

communicating with its own incoming male students, 

informing them of an opportunity, spring football 

practice, that the students were authorized to attend 

under the TSSAA rules.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did it serve the 

suspension or has that been stayed? Was it suspended 

from competition for two years? That was the penalty.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did it -- did that take 

effect?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: The first year it did take 

effect --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: One year --

take effect, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the fine has not been 

paid. The fine.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Not yet. But we've 

recognized that if this turns out to be -- if the TSSAA 

position turns out to be vindicated, the school will be 

obliged to pay the fine.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Blumstein, there's 

one feature of this that I find puzzling. You're making 

this a First Amendment case. But you joined an 

association that has such, certain rules and when one 

joins, one agrees to abide by the rules.

 Nothing in the world stops Brentwood from 

saying this anti-recruiting rule is a really bad rule, 

it is unfair to us; you could have written op ed pieces 

about it, the school could have talked about it, the 

school could have urged the board of education to drop 

it. Nothing stopped you from attacking this rule that 

you don't like. But when you signed on, the First 

Amendment doesn't give you license not to follow the 

rules that you disagree with.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, let me say 

that there's a finding, a stipulation that the school 

thought it was abiding by the rule. It has no intent to 

violate the rule. Intent is not a requirement.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't part of what 

you agree to is a organization that has a certain 

governance structure, the people in the organization 

decide, and then make public to all the members of the 

association what the rules are and how they're going to 

be interpreted?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, Your Honor, let me 

first address, in -- in the appendix to our brief is a 

two page -- a two-sentence letter from Joe Marley to 

Brentwood Academy. This was in the same year in which 

this alleged violation occurred; and in the two-sentence 

letter, Ray Marley, the student's father, said it is our 

attention for Ray to attend Brentwood Academy in 

1997-98, Ray has my consent to participate in the speed 

and strength program at Brentwood Academy.

 The Association then informed the school 

that it was able to allow this young man to come and 

lift weights at the school based upon that letter. So 

when the school wrote a letter and had contact with the 

student, based upon an enrollment contract, they thought 

it was an a fortiori circumstance that if they could 

have Ray Marley lift weights and be there and contact 

the coach, that a much more elaborate contractual 

enrollment form with signing of a contract and paying a 

$300 deposit would allow them to, in fact, have contact

with the coach.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Blumstein, am I not 

correct for purposes of our decision, if you're claiming 

constitutional protection, you're claiming that you'd be 

constitutionally protected even if you knew in advance 

that this particular communication would violate the 

rule and even if you did it deliberately? That's what 

your constitutional position is, is it not?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, our -- Your Honor, the 

significance of the voluntariness --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is it or is it not?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It is.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes. I'm sorry. Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So that what really, 

you're -- it is sort of a side issue as to whether they 

really had adequate notice and so forth, insofar as 

we're talking about the First Amendment?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes, Your Honor. The 

relevance of the signing up and the voluntary 

involvement is ultimately whether there's a waiver; and 

we don't believe that the requirements of waiver have 

either been pled, which is an obligation, it's an 

affirmative defense, has not been pled. This has never 

been treated as a waiver case. It was not in the very

beginning.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the state set up two 

athletic leagues and one had an anti-recruiting rule and 

the other didn't, and they were equally strong, and you 

chose to join the one that had the anti-recruiting 

league. Would it be a violation of the First Amendment 

in your opinion?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: And both are governmental? 

Both are governmental, Justice Alito?

 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, both are governmental.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, I think if a private 

party subjects itself voluntary, voluntarily to a 

regulatory program run by the government or which is 

attributable to the government, then under cases like 

Ibanez, which we emphasize in our brief, that there is 

an obligation on the part of the government to apply the 

rules fairly, unless there is a waiver of some kind, the 

waiver standard is the one that makes a difference. But 

I believe in terms of voluntariness, the only difference 

is whether there is some kind of a waiver.

 In Ibanez where the lawyer, who was also an 

accountant, submitted herself to the jurisdiction of the 

accounting board, there was nothing requiring her to 

submit herself to that jurisdiction.

that they didn't apply the rules fairly, your claim is

Fairly as they were written. But you say even if they 

did apply them fairly, that's no good.

on that.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: But I think perhaps --

JUSTICE ALITO: And even if was purely 

voluntary and even if you had two choices but you chose 

the -- you chose to join the association with the 

anti-recruiting rule, there would be a First Amendment 

problem?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes, Your Honor. If the 

government has a regulatory program providing an 

imprimatur, certification, accreditation, and you as an 

individual or an entity, private entity, seek that 

governmental imprimatur, it's available and you seek 

that, then the government must respect your First 

Amendment rights.

dollars -- and of course that's, I assume that's against 

the rules in Tennessee -- would you have -- would that 

be covered by your First Amendment right?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: No, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why not?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: That would be conduct, Your 

Honor. And I think that, again, the problem that we 

have here is that the TSSAA has not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's not the 

line that we draw elsewhere in the First Amendment.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Between money as an 

inducing, an inducement, we would view an inducement or 

an incentive as conduct, as opposed to speech, 

communication. Here there was no evidence that any 

inducement or emolument or promise of future activity 

was elicited from the school. The only thing that was 

done was sending them a letter informing them about an 

activity that was an approved activity.

 And I think that for our purposes in 

drafting and implementing the undue influence rule, the 

association has never recognized the difference between 

its authority to regulate speech and its authority to 

regulate conduct. And as a result, they've never gone 

through a process of figuring out how can they 

accommodate their legitimate interest.

We -- our school strongly supports a 

recruiting rule that's aimed at barring these kinds of 

conducts, Chief Justice, as you've just described. The 

problem is that the association, by not recognizing that 

the First Amendment enters into the analysis, that they 

have not -- never gone through a process of calculating 

the cost on speech, as this Court's decisions in cases 

like the Lorillard case or the Fox case require that 

they do, that they consider the impact on speech. If 

you don't agree that there's any difference between 

speech and conduct, you don't have to engage in that 

kind of a process.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Blumstein, you're 

making that distinction. Is there -- if the association 

says no school in this association can invite students 

enrolled in other schools to its practice, that's okay? 

Because that's conduct, right? If this is your 

statement, there's nothing to recruit for, because we 

don't allow it period.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would be okay.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: That's correct. We have no 

problem with the revised rules that the association has 

adopted that does not permit spring practice --

non-matriculated students to participate in spring

practice. That's a regulation of conduct and it doesn't 

fall within speech. We think that was the right 

solution, not punishing the school in what --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a little odd, isn't 

it, that they could do -- they could take the stronger 

measure but not the lesser measure of saying it's 

available but we don't want you to broadcast it?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, under the First 

Amendment, it is a core principle that speech about 

lawful or permitted conduct cannot be punished just 

because of the speech. We have a finding of the 

district court that the speech was actually beneficial, 

it was welcomed by the families and by the children who 

received the information. And in fact, it was 

effective. The very thing the TSSAA --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But not beneficial to the 

system. That's why the organization didn't like it. 

And I wanted to come back to something you said just a 

minute ago, that there's an obligation under the First 

Amendment to weigh the effects of speech. Is there? I 

mean, suppose a government organization simply comes out 

with a rule that is perfectly fair, and that happens to 

give due weight to the fact that it's restricting 

speech, but the government organization has frankly 

never considered it. They didn't sit down around a

table and say now, look, this is going affect speech, 

let's be careful here. They didn't do that. They just 

promulgated a perfectly reasonable rule.

 Wouldn't we uphold that?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They don't have to consider 

the matter, do they? They just have to get it right, 

whether they considered it or not.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: I believe that under the 

Lorillard case and under this Court's decision in the 

Fox case, that there is an obligation to engage in what 

is called the careful calculation of cause and benefits.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Certainly. We have to do 

that. Certainly we have to do it in assessing whether, 

what the government has done is okay. But you're saying 

it's invalid unless the government gathers together a 

group of people just to shoot the breeze about -- I 

don't know of any of our cases that require that.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, Your Honor, there was 

in the Lorillard case, the tobacco regulation case, the 

Court was specifically critical that the attorney 

general of Massachusetts did not consider the cost of 

speech, particularly with respect to --

wrong. Then you can say, when the result is wrong, they 

should have considered it. But when it comes out right? 

Do you have any case where it comes out right and it's 

perfectly reasonable, we say tsk, tsk, oh, but even 

though it came out right, they didn't consider speech? 

We've never said anything like that.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: But Justice Scalia, in your 

opinion in the Fox case, one of the safeguards that was 

articulated for speech protection was the need to have a 

procedural safeguard. And one of those safeguards was 

the development of a careful calculation of benefits and 

costs with respect to freedom of speech.

 That was the -- that was the case involving 

the Tupperware parties on the State University campus of 

New York. And one of the protections that was built 

into the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's where you had an 

approval system where one party would be approved and 

another one wouldn't. Of course, in that situation, you 

have to engage case by case in making the weighing. But 

this is not an approval situation. It's the issuance of 

a rule that applies to everybody.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, in addition, there is 

an obligation under this Court's decision in the 

Thompson case for the government to consider non-speech

alternatives, where to restrict -- and to achieve its 

objectives by not regulating speech at all. In the 

Thompson case --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Blumstein, it seems to 

me that Ms. Mahoney addressed that in response to a 

question from me.

 I said, in effect, that once a student has 

signed an enrollment contract, where is there any 

recruiting going on? And she said there is recruiting, 

and hence there is an interest in regulating recruiting, 

because not everybody who signs these contracts, or on 

behalf of whom those contracts are signed, end up going 

to the school. So that in fact, there is room for 

recruiting right up to the moment that the kid arrives 

in the fall and signs on the dotted line.

 What is your response to her response?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, the district court 

found that the constitutional balance tipped at that 

point because the evidence suggested that while that 

does happen, it's not a normal occurrence, fewer than 5 

percent of cases.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how many cases have 

there got to be before you would recognize the 

sufficiency of the asserted state interest?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, I think that once a

family has -- and the evidence in this case established 

that all these families had made their educational 

choice.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, we know that. 

They've signed the contract. So that's where we start.

 And you're saying, well, only about 5 

percent of them weasel out of it later on and go to some 

other school. But why is 5 percent insufficient?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, in this case, the 

association allows the underlying practice itself. It 

permits the underlying practice.

 And so if there's a concern about 

recruiting --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So that if the kid comes 

and says, look, I'm going to Brentwood next fall and I'd 

like to tag along to a spring practice, they say okay. 

But that's not recruiting. The school hasn't initiated 

it. In this case, the school has initiated it by the 

letter. And it does sound like recruiting if you accept 

the proposition that the students aren't bound to go to 

the school even though their parents signed up and some 

of them don't.

 So I come back to my question. If taking 

your figure -- let's assume that only 5 percent, in 

fact, change their minds. Why doesn't -- why isn't

there a legitimate interest in preventing recruiting 

within the 5 percent?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: But there's the whole cited 

Question 3, Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but would you answer 

my question? Why isn't that enough?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, I think, again, as 

long as the association permits this activity and says 

there is a risk of recruiting at that activity if the 

students are not firmly committed, irrevocably committed 

to a place, and that they allow that conduct, then to 

allow the -- to bar the -- the school from talking about 

or at least mentioning the -- the activity as an 

opportunity, then at that point the association if it 

wants to protect its interests must act to prohibit the 

conduct, not the speech.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. It certainly can do 

that. There's no question about it. But it seems to me 

that the line that is being drawn is a line between 

contact which is initiated by the prospective student 

and proselytizing which is initiated by the school. Why 

isn't that a reasonable line?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, because -- Ms. Mahoney 

cited an example that does not require initiated school 

contact. Question 3 prohibits all contact, whether it's

initiated by the school or initiated by the student.

 In joint appendix 181 --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's not what we've got 

before us.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes, we do. She cited 

Question 3, and what it says is, no coach -- no. "A 

coach may not contact a student or his or her parents 

prior to -- "

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. We're still talking 

about athletic contact.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes, but not necessarily 

initiated by the coach. It would be, in fact, 

impermissible. Under their interpretation of their own 

rules, it would be impermissible for the coach to speak 

to people at this practice.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Maybe that would 

present a different kind of problem, but that's not what 

we've got here. What we've got here is contact through 

speech that was initiated by the coach.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And I am saying that if the 

rule generally -- maybe quite imprecisely -- but if it 

generally distinguishes between that kind of 

proselytizing by a coach, and on the other hand contact 

that a kid initiates in the first place, isn't that

roughly a fair line?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, I don't think so, 

Justice Souter, because once the association determines 

that this activity is legitimate, and authorizes this 

with respect to the feeder pattern, so that all public 

schools can be --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The activity being tagging 

along to spring practice?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Participating in spring 

practice. And all the kind of activity that the 

association objects to would be permitted if there were 

a feeder pattern. And in this case, the kind of 

activity that they say they want to isolate the students 

from, what you were describing as coach-initiated 

contact, all of that is permitted in the feeder pattern.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the answer to that is, 

they're not trying to prevent people, at least under 

this rule, they're not trying to prevent 8th grade kids 

from going to spring practice. They're trying to 

prevent coaches from proselytizing kids, and that's the 

distinction. Why isn't it a reasonable distinction?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, the proselytization 

here was found to be a harmless letter sent just 

informing the kids that they had an opportunity. So I 

guess it depends on how one characterizes what the

communication is.

 We would characterize --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It was a letter from coach. 

It was a letter from coach. I mean, that to a young 

kid, that is recruiting. That is showing an interest on 

the part of the person who's going to decide who plays, 

an interest in you.

 I think it's entirely reasonable to consider 

that recruiting.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: But the letter, 

Justice Scalia, went to all students, not just the 

athletes. It was not targeted to any particular person. 

All 12 students who -- male students who were admitted, 

were incoming students, all of those students got the 

letter. It wasn't targeted in any type of recruiting 

mode. Every student who was admitted and signed the 

contract received the letter.

 And a 13th student who was admitted but who 

did not sign the enrollment contract did not receive the 

letter. So that the school was very careful, so that 

they --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it fair to say "your 

coach"? The letter was signed by your coach, not just 

coach.

students, Justice Ginsburg, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And did it say, by the way, 

everybody got this letter? Did it say that at the 

bottom?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Again we think if the 

practice itself was problematic, was educationally 

unsound, if there was a risk of any of the interests 

that were involved, then the association could and did 

prohibit participation in that activity.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Weren't all these things 

that are being discussed before the factfinder, or was 

there some ex parte contact later which was the only 

evidence for what we're talking about now? I'm getting 

into the due process point.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: The information that was 

before the factfinder had to do with, on the due process 

point, had to do with a person who was not related to 

the school but who had been, it turns out falsely, 

accused of offering inducements to students to attend 

the school.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I mean, all of these 

matters were discussed and there was an opportunity to 

reply to all of these matters that we've just been 

talking about, correct?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes. There was a procedure

in which there was an exchange of letters between the 

association and the school, in which the association had 

some investigation and then the school had an 

opportunity to respond. Yes, Judge Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It doesn't seem to me like 

there's a strong case for a flawed hearing for a due 

process violation.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: The problem was that the 

district court made two findings in this regard that 

were very important: That the association misled the 

school as to what issues were still open and available; 

and that ultimately a matter involving this Bart King 

was discussed at the closed after-hearing session, 

executive session, and the school had been told that the 

Bart King allegations were no longer on the table.

 Now, the school did put forward evidence 

about one youngster named Jacques Curry who was alleged 

to have been recruited by Bart King. Again, Bart King 

had no status with the school at all. And they put 

Jacques Curry before the hearing panel and the hearing 

panel wound up restoring his eligibility.

 But it turns out that they, at the trial, 

that the association members, or the board of control, 

admitted that they considered the Bart King allegations 

to enhance the penalty. So it must have been something

beyond Jacques Curry and that the school was never 

informed that the Bart King's involvement beyond Jacques 

Curry had anything to did with the proceedings.

 So the district court found there was 

misleading of the school and that they -- the school 

never had a chance to respond to the evidence that was 

presented by these investigators for the association. 

And so therefore they did not have evidence, they were 

not aware of evidence, and they didn't have a chance to 

respond or to reply to that evidence.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What was the evidence?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE BREYER: What was the evidence?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: We don't know what the 

evidence was.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, at this late date, 

you've had trials. You're saying -- did you ask? With 

all these people under oath, haven't you had trials and 

everything?

that --

investigators.

some notes taken by investigators, which did they have 

anything new in them you hadn't seen before?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: We hadn't seen, we hadn't 

seen them before the hearing.

had not seen before in the notes?

that you had not previously seen and therefore had no 

opportunity to rebut? What particularly and 

specifically? And it's surprising to me that you

those issues were even on the table. The executive

was no longer on the table, and the notes were not 

presented to the --

JUSTICE BREYER: What did it say in the 

notes that you, a factual matter or some other, that you 

did not have a chance to reply to specifically?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Well, we learned that the 

investigators had not spoken to Mr. King.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What you learned was the 

investigators had not spoken to Mr. King, and you 

previously did not know that, and if you had known that 

you would have said to the decisionmaker: The 

investigators did not speak to Mr. King. And if you had 

said that, how would this case be different?

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: What we would have been in a 

position to say, Your Honor, was that we want to 

understand what your perception, your, the 

investigators' perception, is of what Bart King's 

relationship to Brentwood Academy is and how -- and what 

he is alleged to have done.

 We have no control, we had no knowledge, of 

anything that Mr. King did, and if any of those 

allegations were true the school wanted an opportunity 

to disassociate itself.

taken that --

that you had a witness available to testify, but you

was availability. And he -- and we put him up, offered 

him for --

claiming that Mr. King is part of your operation.

Justice Breyer, that in fact they -- that they 

considered the King allegations. We don't know exactly 

what that meant at the trial.

given at trial, and the trial judge found this, was that 

he played a role, not in the liable but in the penalty.

reduced it ed it from $3,000 to less had they not been

something to do with this erroneous thing of Mr. King? 

It's surprising to me all of this is coming up now, but 

there we are. So but that's your specific claim.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: The concern was that the 

association had told us, and the district court found 

this, that the King allegations were not on the table.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought it was a 

different claim. I thought you were claiming there was 

a violation of due process because an investigator spoke 

without you present to the board.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And that I would think was 

not a violation of the Constitution since it happens 

every day of the week in administrative agencies. But 

if you want to claim it is, I'll be happy to listen.

 And I think in that you're saying the 

Administrative Procedures Act is unconstitutional, which 

would be a surprising claim to me.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: No, but that we -- that the 

disclosure of evidence as a basis of decision and an 

opportunity to respond to that evidence in a 

disciplinary hearing this Court has held as recently as 

the Hamdi case and certainly in Laudermill that that is 

an important procedural protection of due process, and

that's what we're seeking in this case as well, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you.

 MR. BLUMSTEIN: Again, we think that the 

First Amendment framework that exists for regulatory 

cases fits this case well. The only difference is 

whether or not there's a waiver. We think there's not a 

waiver. The Government has claimed that they can define 

away First Amendment rights. In our brief we address 

that claim. We don't believe that the Government can 

define away First Amendment rights, and there is not a 

case that they have cited really that supports the 

position that the First Amendment should apply 

differently in this context, where the Government is 

regulating just because it is, the source of authority 

is a different source of authority, a non-sovereign 

source of authority.

 The Southeastern Promotions case, the Ibanez 

case, those cases, the Barnett case, and the Fox case, 

Justice Scalia's opinion in the Fox case, make it clear 

that the source of authority, in that case universities, 

is not determinative. The Fox case discussed the 

elements of commercial speech and that arose in a 

university context, but it's been applied across the 

board in all commercial speech cases, regulatory cases,

whether there was sovereign power or, as in the case of 

Fox, it was not sovereign power at all.

 So we think that the First Amendment 

doctrine, the rubric that we've described in our brief, 

is the proper one that should be applied in this 

circumstance and that there's not a need to carve out a 

special exception, which is what the Government is 

asking for and what the TSSAA is asking for, to 

generally applicable First Amendment doctrine.

 This is a case of content-based regulation. 

The time, place, and manner defense therefore cannot 

work as a defense, and we think therefore, the TSSAA 

case collapses under First Amendment.

 Thank you very much.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. MAHONEY: Thank you.

in fact the association has violated civil rights by 

failing to give due process Brentwood would still be 

entitled to an award of attorney's fees. And I think

it's critical that when an association enters into a 

contract and agrees upon procedures, that if those 

procedures can -- are not followed, a member of the 

association can bring a breach of contract action in 

State court.

 But Brentwood did not do that. Instead it 

tried to constitutionalize this contract dispute and 

assert rights under Section 1983.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought it had some 

State claims as pendant claims.

 MS. MAHONEY: The only State claim they had 

as a pendant claim was arbitrary action under State law, 

and the district court dismissed that because it found 

that the questions were sufficiently novel that he 

didn't feel that he should entertain jurisdiction over 

it. But they did not assert a breach of contract claim.

 And it's important to note that the bylaws 

actually provide that a member must be given, quote, 

"notice of the charges and an opportunity to present its 

case at a hearing." So if they actually did not get 

notice of the charges involving Bart King, it would have 

been a breach of contract. So that's the first problem, 

is that the court of appeals didn't even look at the 

fact that they had a contract remedy, just like the 

contractor had in Lujan, and they simply weren't taking

advantage of it.

 Second, the suggestion that they were not 

actually given notice is contradicted by the record. 

And it's not issues of credibility. This is just an 

ultimate conclusion about whether they had sufficient 

notice. And if you look at the record, the exchange of 

letters, at JA-205 is the letter that starts by 

disclosing the charges, and it specifically discloses 

that the association investigators have talked to a 

number of middle school students, have talked to a 

number of middle school coaches, and details precisely 

what those witnesses have said about Bart King.

 Now they say, well, we didn't know that Bart 

King was still involved by the time we got to the last 

hearing. But look in fact what they did. They came to 

the hearing. They submitted the affidavit of Bart King. 

One of their live witnesses was Jacques Curry and the 

only thing he testified about was his relationship with 

Bart King.

 And then they ran out of time. They ran out 

of time. They had Bart King there. They were thinking 

about putting him on live. They had had an allotted 

period of time. They used it all up without putting --

There was absolutely nothing they've said that they 

didn't know about.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, didn't one of the 

decisionmakers testify that they relied on this --

MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, most of them 

actually testified that they did not.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but one did.

put him on, they say: "It was our intention to put him 

on, but I don't know if you are all interested in 

extending for five minutes to hear from Bart King or 

not. He's here if you want him." Carter responds "No." 

He doesn't say: The King issues aren't on the table.

 Thank you, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

We're not going to extend for five minutes.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:24 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
