 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in case 05-1541, EC Term of Years 

Trust vs. United States.

 Mr. Ainsa.

 ORAL ARGUMENT FRANCIS S. AINSA, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. AINSA: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 The Defendant, in unequivocal language of 

section 1346, waives sovereign immunity and permits a 

refund suit by a third party such as Petitioner. That 

conclusion that I've stated to the Court was supported 

by the holding in United States versus Williams. That 

case, as the Court well knows, dealt with a situation in 

which the Government sought to recover money through a 

tax lien as opposed to a tax levy, which is the 

situation in this case. However, there is no 

substantive difference between the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And why did the court 

point out twice in Williams that section 7426 was not 

available?

 MR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, section 7426 

was not available in the case of Mrs. Williams, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because there was no 

levy. It was only a lien.

 MR. AINSA: It was a lien case, and of 

course, 7426 involves a levy. But nonetheless, the 

holding that I have read in that case very definitively 

deals with the breadth of section 1346. And the breadth 

of section 1346, according to the holding and United 

States vs. Williams, is certainly broad enough to 

encompass a third party like Petitioner. I do not view 

the fact that 7426 was not available to be a controlling 

issue because the question was whether or not 1346 would 

permit a third party to bring a refund action. And that 

was the holding of the court as I read that opinion.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But when Congress 

provides a special remedy for a particular class of 

persons, that special remedy usually excludes a more 

general provision.

 MR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, in the case of 

7426, Congress never made that remedy expressly 

exclusive. The language is completely missing from that 

statute. And the argument was raised in United States 

vs. Williams that if section 1346 was made available to 

third parties, like Mrs. Williams, it would render 

meaningless the short statute of limitations.

 1346 offers only post deprivation relief.

section 7426 offers both pre and post deprivation 

relief. So the two statutes can live in harmony and can 

be harmonized and should not be held to have preempt --

one over the other when there is no express declaration 

from Congress making that the case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Government does cite 

the principle that when there's a specific statutory 

scheme that controls over a more general one. It 

doesn't cite a tax case for that, at least as I recall. 

Has that principle ever been applied in the tax code, do 

you know?

 MR. AINSA: Justice Kennedy, I don't believe 

that's been applied in the tax code, but I can answer 

your question, I think, by saying this. Congress on 

many instances has made provisions of the United States 

Internal Revenue Code exclusive. Congress knows how to 

write those provisions into the tax code when it wants 

to do so. In this case, it was not done.

 And I would also like to point out that 

after the decision in United States vs. Williams, 

Congress amended 7426 to add a special provision. And 

in that special provision, it was made exclusive. And I 

use that to exemplify the fact that Congress can, when 

it wants to, make a tax provision exclusive.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: In the law, we don't -- we

certainly don't want to deprive any statutory provision 

of its whole purpose and effect. And as I understand 

the purpose of this especially short statute of 

limitations, it is to enable the Government to dispose 

of the property that it has seized, and to be able to 

give clear title to it without somebody coming back, you 

know, many years later and saying this property should 

not have been taken. How is that purpose served if 

indeed you can proceed under the provision that has a 

longer statute?

 MR. AINSA: Justice Scalia, 7426 has four 

different components. Two of the components are clearly 

pre-deprivation type remedies. They are the ability of 

a taxpayer or third party to seek an injunction to 

prohibit the Government from either selling property or 

conducting a levy. Those are clearly pre-deprivation.

 The other two are primarily post deprivation 

remedies. And so the object that the Government was 

trying to achieve can be achieved through looking at it 

from a pre-deprivation/post-deprivation analysis. I 

don't believe that the Government's underlying purpose 

is in any way diminished when the two statutes can live 

in harmony. And without having an exclusivity provision 

expressly stated in 7426, and given the fact that 1346 

on its face plainly waives sovereign immunity for third

parties to bring refund suits, the two statutes must be 

construed --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't there this 

difference between the two. One of them -- you're not 

challenging the amount of the tax in this case, are you?

 MR. AINSA: Your Honor, I'm sorry. I didn't 

understand your question.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You're not challenging the 

amount of the assessed tax, are you? You're just --

whether they can collect it from this particular person?

 MR. AINSA: Petitioner is not challenging 

the underlying assessment against the taxpayer.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And isn't that the basic 

difference between the two statutes, that one of them 

deals with a fight about how much money the taxpayer 

owes, and the other one deals with the method of 

collection.

 MR. AINSA: 7426 clearly prevents a person 

from contesting the underlying assessment, whereas in 

1346, that is possible. But in this case, 1346 is broad 

enough because it uses the term collected. And just 

like in Williams, we are not seeking to contest the 

underlying assessment.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it does seem to me if 

you think of the two statutes as performing rather

separate functions, one primarily focused at the method 

of collection, the other the amount of tax, makes quite 

good sense to have different statute of limitations for 

the two, because there is an interest in the prompt 

resolution of the former issue that doesn't apply to the 

latter.

 MR. AINSA: Justice Stevens, there is 

certainly -- Government has demonstrated by -- or 

Congress has demonstrated by passing 7426, that there is 

an interest in a shorter statute of limitations in 

certain cases.

 However, I return to my original argument 

that if 1346 is broad enough to encompass third party 

refund suits, and if Congress has not made 7426 

exclusive, the two statutes should be allowed to 

coexist. This Court has held on other occasions that it 

will not preempt statutes without a very clear 

expression from Congress. And Congress, once again, 

knew how to do it after the Williams case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose -- tell me 

if I'm wrong, or the Government can tell me if I'm wrong 

-- but there is this difference also that in a refund 

suit, you have to pay the money. The Government has the 

money before you can bring the refund suit. Am I right 

about that?

MR. AINSA: That is correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Incidentally, I'm just 

curious, if the underlying assessment -- if you wished 

to have challenged the underlying assessment, it's for a 

million dollars, can you pay $100,000 and then bring the 

refund suit in order to test the validity of the tax, or 

do you have to pay the whole amount?

 MR. AINSA: The whole amount.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the 

underlying principle that waivers of sovereign immunity 

are strictly construed. And when you have a waiver on 

the broader statute, but shouldn't you read them 

together with the specific to suggest that they weren't 

waiving sovereign immunity when a more specific statute 

governed, except to the extent of the provisions in that 

more specific statute.

 MR. AINSA: Mr. Chief Justice, when I read 

the opinion in United States vs. Williams, the Nordic 

case was brought up by the dissent in that case, that 

there must be an absolutely unequivocal waiver of 

sovereign immunity in order to allow a particular suit 

against the United States. The holding in United States 

versus Williams was that 1346 was sufficiently broad. 

And given that holding, and given the fact that the 

Government was asserting that Mrs. Williams had other

remedies in the form of a quiet title action, a refund 

action --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The court took care to 

point out why those were not realistic remedies. But 

here there is a prompt and efficient remedy.

 MR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, there is 

another remedy, which is certainly governed by a much 

shorter statute of limitations. But in my view, the 

equities or the facts of the case should not drive the 

construction of the statute, any more than it did in 

United States versus Williams. And if 1346 is broad 

enough to encompass a third party case in the instance 

of a lien, it is broad enough to encompass it in the 

case of a levy. There is no functional substantive 

difference between money taken from a -- from a third 

party via a lien or via a levy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, your argument is 

probably based on the statute. I just question one 

phrase you mentioned, which was that Williams was not 

driven by the equities. It seems to me it was wholly 

driven by the equities.

 MR. AINSA: Justice Kennedy, as I read the 

holding in United States vs. Williams, the Court found 

that there was an unequivocal waiver of sovereign 

immunity in section 1346. And observed afterwards that

a person like Mrs. Williams did not have a meaningful 

remedy. I did not read that to be -- that the 

construction of the statute was driven by the equities. 

It was an observation after the fact.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was a determination 

that the word taxpayer encompassed someone who had, in 

fact, paid the tax. Here you don't even have that, 

because the tax wasn't paid directly by the EC Trust. 

The trust deposited the money in the bank, and then the 

Government levied on it, as distinguished from Williams, 

where Mrs. Williams, in fact, wrote a check to the 

Internal Revenue Service covering her husband's tax 

liability.

 MR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, I believe that 

both Mrs. Williams and the trust are in the same 

position. Both of them paid the tax. Both were third 

parties. Neither was a taxpayer. In the case of 

Williams, the taxpayer was her husband. In the case of 

the trust --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the whole case was 

about whether she indeed qualified as a taxpayer, having 

voluntarily paid the tax.

 MR. AINSA: In this case, the levy was an 

involuntary act on the part of the Government to take 

the money from EC Trust, from the deposit that was put

up.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. It was an 

involuntary act, whereas in Williams, she stepped 

forward and paid the tax and claimed on that basis that 

she was the taxpayer.

 MR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, the situation 

in Williams, however, involved the tax lien. 

Mrs. Williams would not have paid the tax had the 

Government not asserted the tax lien and forced her to 

pay the tax out of the proceeds of the house when it was 

sold. It was no more voluntary than a levy in the sense 

that I'm talking about.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why isn't the obvious 

difference -- I may have missed this -- but you say, in 

the case, a taxpayer owed some money and the Government 

via a lien took property from a different person who 

then had to pay the tax who then had to get rid of the 

lien and wanted it back. And in this case they did 

exactly the same thing but they did it via a levy. So 

you say if the first could sue so could the second.

 But the difference, the obvious difference, 

which maybe you have explained and I missed, is that in 

the second case, namely this case, there is a specific 

statute that says you have to do it with a levy in nine 

months, and in the other case there wasn't such a

statute. Why isn't that the obvious difference?

 MR. AINSA: Justice Breyer, the answer is 

because 1346 also permits a third party to bring a 

refund action. It is not restricted even though there 

is a specific statute dealing with levies, 1346 was held 

to be broad enough to -- to encompass the refund action.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Encompasses a lien for a 

refund action in the case where you took the property 

via a lien. And you'd say -- they say, I guess, but it 

doesn't encompass it when you take it via a levy. Why 

not? Because of the specific, the same thing I just 

said. Now I want to be sure I have your whole answer to 

that.

 MR. AINSA: My answer to that is there is no 

substantive distinction between a levy and a lien. And 

that while Williams dealt with a lien, and I fully 

understand that, the taking by the Government was just 

as involuntary under the levy as it is with a lien. And 

once section 1346 is deemed to be broad enough or held 

to be broad enough to encompass a refund action, it 

should encompass an action by the levy.

 Essentially I'm arguing that the two 

statutes can coexist together and should coexist 

together in the absence of a clear declaration from 

Congress that 7426 is exclusive. I can support my

argument by the fact that after Williams, Congress did 

make, did amend 7426 and did make a specific new remedy 

and they're exclusive. Congress could have done that at 

the time 7426 was originally enacted in 1966 but did not 

do so.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If your interpretation is 

correct then are there many such cases where the 

Government takes property via a levy and the person who 

wants to sue would get worried about nine months, 

because obviously he would think I can sue under a --

kind of thing. It's two years. So are there still some 

where he would have to worry about nine months?

 MR. AINSA: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, are -- in 

your interpretation, does the nine-month statute become 

meaningless?

 MR. AINSA: It, it does not become 

meaningless because 7426 offers certain remedies that 

are clearly post deprivation such as filing for an 

injunction to stop the levy, filing for an injunction to 

stop a foreclosure. Those are still viable under 7426 

and would fall within the nine-month period but 

essentially Congress has permitted two different 

complementary actions to seek a refund.

pointed to situations where one to expect action to be 

taken promptly. You don't want to wait to, to get an 

injunction against a levy because the Government might 

be there and levy on the property and then you're out of 

luck. Where the incompatibility exists is post 

deprivation, when the nine-month, the interest in having 

these claims resolved properly is totally defeated if 

you can get the longer statute of limitations under the 

general refund statute.

 MR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, if I 

understand your question you're really talking about the 

underlying policy of a short statute of limitations 

driving certain types of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's why the code has 

that nine-month period instead of the two-year or in 

fact four-years because you have to go to the 

administrative process first. The whole purpose of the 

nine-months is to get people to act quickly.

 MR. AINSA: But I can say to you that with 

some degree, I think, of sound legal argument, that once 

1346 was found to have unequivocally waived sovereign 

immunity for third party refund actions in the context 

of a lien it should also follow that it waived sovereign 

immunity for levies because there is no fundamental 

legal difference between the manner in which the money

is extracted from the third party. There is no, the 

core logic of the decision in United States vs. Williams 

is that money was involuntarily taken from Mrs. -- from 

Mrs. Williams.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It doesn't seem to me that 

the fact that there is a waiver of sovereign immunity 

with regard to levies answers the statute of limitations 

question. Sure, there is a waive of sovereign immunity, 

but the question is how long does the -- how promptly do 

you have to act?

 MR. AINSA: Justice Stevens, the -- the 

issue of the statute of limitations I believe is 

dependent upon whether or not 1346 provides for 

remaining a viable method of seeking a refund. And my 

position is that if 1346 does provide that in the 

context of a levy, then you have in effect two statutory 

schemes which coexist; one is 7426 and one is 10 - uh, 

1346. It is true that they overlap in the sense that 

there is a refund provision that could be sought under 

either one of them, but 7426 is distinctly different in 

that it offers pre-deprivation relief that is not 

offered under 1326.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Getting back to my earlier 

question, if there is a million-dollar tax liability, 

and there is a levy on the bank account for $100,000, do

you have to pay the extra 900,000 before can you bring 

the refund suit?

 MR. AINSA: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that's, that's also a 

difference.

 MR. AINSA: Yes. In this case, it wasn't a 

million dollars, it was $3 million and the entire amount 

was paid in order to bring the refund suit.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if the amount wasn't 

paid and what if your client just sat back and the, the 

assets, or let's say some real estate were, were seized 

by the Government. Would the 1346 action still lie? Or 

is it only for return of money that, that's been paid to 

satisfy the tax?

 MR. AINSA: 1346 in my view would not apply 

to that situation, in that if property was seized and 

used to, under a tax lien, if that was seized and the 

Government proceeded to sell, then the third party, 

Petitioner, would have to file for an injunction to stop 

the foreclosure sale under 7426.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's the, it seems to 

me the principal problem that the Government was facing 

and justified the short statute, wasn't it? That is the 

need to get, to be able to convey clear title to this 

property that it has seized. But once -- once the money

is put up, and what the Government has taken is in 

effect payment of the tax, maybe there is no harm in 

proceeding under 1346.

 MR. AINSA: Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm helping you.

 MR. AINSA: There is no harm in proceeding 

under 1346 once the money is paid because you're dealing 

with a simple refund action. You're not dealing with 

trying to stop a foreclosure suit or stop a levy. 

You're dealing with a simple foreclosure action.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there may 

be situations where the Government, having levied, 

doesn't feel the need to pursued other remedies 

available to it. And if you then allow a challenge to 

the levy to come in later the person they would have 

proceeded against if they didn't have the levy may have 

left the country, may have dissipated the funds that 

they would otherwise go after. They need to know early 

on that they are barking up the wrong tree if they have 

levied on the wrong property, and that's why you have a 

short statute to clear that up as soon as possible.

 MR. AINSA: Mr. Chief Justice, there is 

rationale for having a short statute, but once again I 

point out that you have two statutory schemes which 

appear to be able to be harmonized and coexist together.

1346 constitutes or at least the language is clear and 

unequivocal in its waiver of sovereign immunity for a 

third party who desires to collect a tax that's been 

taken from that third party. And with that 

construction, it seems to me that only Congress can --

can deal with the question that you've just raised, if 

Congress wants to make it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The -- the, the statute 

that you point to talks about taking a civil action 

against the United States. When there has been a 

wrongful levy, is that right?

 MR. AINSA: 7426.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't say an 

injunctive action. So I would reading it think it 

encompasses both actions for injunctions, which are 

rare, probably, and what I think is not rare at all, an 

action for damages or money back. Now your reading of 

the statute takes that whole ordinary case, where people 

are just suing to get back some money, and it says our 

nine-month statute of limitations here is meaningless. 

All it applies to are injunctive actions which I bet are 

far and few between. You can tell me I'm wrong on that.

 MR. AINSA: Okay.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I won't say you've made it 

meaningless but you have eviscerated it. Is that fair?

MR. AINSA: Justice Breyer, it is fair. And 

it's fair for this reason, that in the Williams case the 

very --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, is my 

characterization fair?

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: You want to say no to that.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. AINSA: In the Williams case, the very 

same argument was raised, that 7426 would be rendered 

meaningless if, and other, the quiet title action and 

other actions would be rendered meanings less if 1346 

was construed to allow Mrs. Williams to have a third 

party action.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why would it have? Because 

there I think we are talking about liens and it doesn't 

cover liens, the specifics statute.

 MR. AINSA: The Government contended that 

Mrs. Williams had remedies available to her, certainly 

not a levy, because there was no levy, but the 

Government was contending she could have sought relief 

under the Quiet Title Act. She could have sought relief 

by posting --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the Government -- and 

the opinion points out that if she had gone the quiet

title route she would have lost the advantageous -- she 

would have had to make. She could never complete a 

quiet title suit within the time that she needed to 

execute this sale.

 MR. AINSA: Justice Ginsburg, I, I know 

you've found that in the opinion. But at the same time 

I'm pointing out that the Government was contending that 

the Quiet Title Act was available to Mrs. Williams, and 

also that she could have simply put the money up. And 

-- put the money up, and the land would have been 

released and there was an argument over whether the 

secretary would have discretion to turn her down. But 

the point is there were other remedies out there, and 

they were not deemed --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the, and the opinion 

suggests -- not merely suggests, determines -- that 

those other remedies, unlike 7426 in cases where it 

applies, were ineffective. The Government raised other 

remedies and the Court said they were ineffective.

 MR. AINSA: The other remedies I understand 

were determined to be not meaningful in the opinion of 

the Court. But I'm pointing out that argument was 

raised and rejected. And it was rejected because, 

because 1346 as I understand it has a life of its own, 

so to speak, and it was construed to be an unequivocal

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD,

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court.

 When Congress creates a specific remedy for 

a specific situation that remedy forecloses resort to a 

more general remedy when that general remedy would 

frustrate the purposes of the specific remedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have a citation for 

that as would apply to the Internal Revenue code?

 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor. The A.S. 

Kreider decision that we discuss in our brief is about 

was whether or not the sorter statute of limitations, 

ironically, in the case for refund suit, applied, rather 

than the broad general Tucker Act statute of 

limitations. And this Court held that the specific 

controlled over the general because Congress was 

entitled to provide more specifically in a particular

situation when the need called for it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was, was the more specific 

statute there enacted after the more general statute?

 MS. MAYNARD: Both of those statutes, it's 

been a long time, Your Honor. I'm not, I'm not totally 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The reason I ask is we --

we do have a principle which I think is a sound one, 

that repeals by implication are not fatal. And what 

you're saying is that the enactment of the more narrow 

statute impliedly repeals the cause of action that 

existed under 1346. Do you know if any of your cases 

that you cite, even those outside of the Internal 

Revenue field, involve more specific statutes enacted 

after the general statute that they supposedly limit?

 MS. MAYNARD: I'm not sure if they answer 

that precise question, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess --

MS. MAYNARD: -- the implied repeal analysis 

is not the proper analysis to apply here, because the 

proper principle is that the specific remedy forecloses 

resort to the more general remedy, when two things are 

true.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's certainly true 

when the two are enacted at the same time, obviously.

Or even when the, when the general is enacted after the 

more specific one and does not thereby limit the more 

specific one. But, well --

MS. MAYNARD: In -- in this Court's case, if 

I can answer your, the principle of your question, Your 

Honor, which is that the replied repeal doctrine is not 

the proper analysis here because the specific controls 

the general.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If 7426 had not been 

enacted, wouldn't this case have fallen within 1346 as 

interpreted by Williams.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, we would certainly have 

a more difficult argument here if that were the case, 

Your Honor. But Williams' specific withholding was --

didn't answer the question at issue here, because it 

only held that a person who had been subjected to a 

lien, involuntarily paid it under duress, could be a 

taxpayer within the meaning of 1346. But it didn't 

answer the question here, which is whether or not when 

Congress has provided specifically for parties in 

Petitioner's situation and created a remedial scheme 

that would be wholly frustrated --

JUSTICE ALITO: What could you point to in 

the language of 1346 that would take this case outside 

of 1346 as interpreted in Williams?

MS. MAYNARD: That would be a difficult 

argument to make, that it doesn't fall within the 

erroneously or illegally collected tax. But that was 

the same case in A.S. Kreider. That was the same 

language in A.S. Kreider, the erroneously collected tax. 

Yet the Court held that the more specific refund statute 

of limitations there applied.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But if this case would have 

fallen within 1346 as interpreted by Williams until --

then you must be arguing that 1346 was in part impliedly 

repealed when 7426 was enacted.

 MS. MAYNARD: One can look at it that way, 

Your Honor. But I think if one looks at it that way 

then I think this Court's cases in Brown and Block are 

how you apply the implied repeal analysis when a 

specific statute would be wholly fully frustrated by 

application of a more general statute. And that's 

particularly true where it's uncertain at the time 

Congress enacted the specific statute.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't, I don't see how 

you can say there's frustration. Perhaps I'm missing 

something. It seems to me that for years the Revenue 

Code has had two basic schemes. One is you can contest 

the liability before you pay the money. The other is 

you pay the money and sue for refund. And one requires

you go to the Tax Court and the other district court and 

so forth. So these are two different schemes and here 

you have to -- we are advised that even if there was a 

levy for $100,000 you, couldn't contest it unless you 

paid the extra 900. So those are two very different 

schemes. Am I wrong about that?

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, they are two very 

different schemes, Your Honor, and one is for the 

situation that Petitioner faces, which is a third party 

whose property is levied upon to collect the taxes of 

another, and it has its own venue provisions, its own 

jurisdictional provisions, its own short statute of 

limitations. Importantly, however --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, because the 

Government doesn't have the money. But in the refund 

suit the Government has the money.

 MS. MAYNARD: No, no, Your Honor. In a levy 

suit the Government often does have the property.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Often does, but not 

necessarily, and doesn't have to have all the amount.

 MS. MAYNARD: Not -- I think, Your Honor, 

the Flora requirement, which is a judicially 

interpretation on the refund statute which requires you, 

a taxpayer to pay all of its tax liability for a given 

year before it can bring a refund statute challenge,

actually supports our argument here because it shows how 

complicated it would be to apply that scheme when you're 

talking about a party who doesn't owe the tax. We 

haven't -- the Government has not assessed the tax 

against the trust here. It believes the trust is a 

nominee or alter ego of the taxpayer and the -- the 

wrongful levy statute has a short statute of limitations 

for the precise reason that if we seize the property of 

the trust the Government needs to know promptly if the 

trust claims it's not the taxpayer's property because 

the Government, as the Chief Justice indicated, will 

cease going after the taxpayer if it believes it has 

already collected the tax from someone else that it 

believes to be holding the money for the taxpayer, which 

is different and crucially different than in a refund 

suit, as Justice Stevens alluded to, because in a refund 

suit where the taxpayer brings the challenge and has 

paid the tax, at the end of that suit either the 

Government has to pay the money back to the taxpayer in 

a refund or the Government gets to keep the tax and 

that's the end of the matter.

 In a third party challenge, whether the 

third party brings it pre- deprivation or 

post-deprivation, the Government's interest is knowing 

whether or not the third party has taxpayer property or

not. Because if it turns out that it's not the 

taxpayer's property the Government needs to pursue the 

taxpayer. And Congress accounted for that not only in 

7426 by the short statute of limitations, but also for 

the expression suspension of the Government's period of 

time that it can pursue the taxpayer. The, the section 

7426 expressly suspends the time period during the 

running of a third party challenge whether that's pre or 

post deprivation.

 In addition, the -- if I can go back to 

Justice Scalia, I would like to impress upon you why we 

don't believe the implied repeal doctrine is applicable 

here, and not only is it because the specific controls 

the general when it would be wholly frustrated as it 

would be here by both the statute of limitations 

provision and its express suspension, but also because 

the availability of the general remedy was uncertain at 

the time that Congress passed -- and for the purposes of 

the implied repeal doctrine that's the proper analysis: 

What did the 1966 Congress think it needed to say in 

order to make this the exclusive remedy? The state of 

the law at the time --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Pre-Williams you're talking 

about?

state of the law at the time when the Congress was 

deciding how to write this provision, there was 

certainly no authoritative pronouncement that, that the, 

that third parties could bring a suit, and indeed the 

law that --

JUSTICE ALITO: Why does that make your 

argument stronger? If Congress didn't think that 1346 

applied, then surely it didn't intend to repeal it.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, the cases say it matters 

what the Congress saw at the time it passed the statute 

in Brown and Block. But the reason it does matter as a 

logical matter is that the state of the law was such 

that third parties couldn't bring a refund suit under 

1346. The actions that had been allowed, Your Honor, 

were against the IRS officials and those were expressly 

replaced by the statute. Congress expressly replaced 

them in section 7426(d) and (e), which is on 12a of our, 

of our petition. So that shows that Congress did intend 

to make this the exclusive remedy.

 The other reason why I think you can --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did you make that argument, 

did the Government make that argument, in Williams?

 MS. MAYNARD: Did we make the argument in 

Williams?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, that -- that Congress

had enacted another statute which presumes that there is 

no cause of action under 1346?

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, the Government conceded 

in Williams that 7426 was not available to Ms. Williams 

there because she had only been subjected to a lien, not 

a levy.  So the remedies the Government was pointing to 

in that case as exclusive of the 1346 remedy were the 

quiet title action and a discretionary --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but even if it wasn't 

available to her, the fact that there was another 

statute the whole premise for which is the 

unavailability of a remedy under 1346, it seems to me 

that would have, that would have strengthened the 

Government's case in Williams.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, we did point to the 

statute, Your Honor, and suggest that the Congress had 

made it available. I think the other reason why the 

implied repeal doctrine is not the right analysis here 

is that section 7426 did not withdraw any substantive 

rights. This, the trust here is simply trying to take 

advantage of another remedial provision, 1346, and 

rename its cause of action. They're bringing exactly 

the same -- their complaint is substantively identical 

to the complaint they brought in their first action.

in the Kreider case. I can't tell, I don't know. But 

this case was a specific statute of limitations acted 

after the general refund statute, right?

 MS. MAYNARD: That's right, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And in the prior case it 

seems to be a specific statute that was enacted in 1926. 

I just got it out of the library.  They give it to us, 

you know, if you ask them.

 MS. MAYNARD: Bless them, Your Honor.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: And it was the 1926 code 

and it concerned 1926 income, so it must have been 

brought, the suit, fairly close to when that was 

enacted. And the general provision was a general 

judicial code provision having to do with general 

statute of limitations and, no, it doesn't say. It 

looks -- I mean, it sounds as if that had been long in 

existence.

 MS. MAYNARD: I believe it had been. It was 

a Tucker Act provision. Thank you. That would be the 

answer to your question, Justice Scalia.

 But in direct response to the question you 

started with, Justice Breyer, Congress -- the general 

statute of limitations for refund actions did already 

exist. In fact, the Government believes it's

significant when Congress passed 7426, instead of 

referring to that specific provision, it placed in the 

same section of the code a shorter statute of 

limitations specifically for these actions. It created 

a new subsection and said 7426 actions must be brought 

within 9 months.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why was it so 

hard for them to say that this is an exclusive remedy, 

as they have done in other situations?

 MS. MAYNARD: As I indicated, Your Honor, at 

the time there was no authoritative pronouncement. If 

even --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's even all the 

more reason for them to say. I mean. If there's 

confusion about what remedies are available and they 

want it to be exclusive, it's easy enough to say that.

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, the remedies that have 

been allowed by the courts, Your Honor -- and we 

believe, in the absence of any appropriate waiver -- but 

the actions that have been allowed have been allowed 

against IRS officials, and Congress did expressly 

replace those, on 12a, in 7426(d): "No action may be 

maintained against any officer or employee of the United 

States."

suggests that they know how to spell out exclusivity 

when they have it in mind, and they didn't do it with 

respect to the availability of an action under 1346.

 MS. MAYNARD: That's true, Your Honor. But 

I think for purposes of trying to discern the intent of 

the 1966 Congress one has to look at the state of the 

law in 1966. And there was no reason to believe and 

certainly no authoritative pronouncement at the time 

that 1346 covered this type of action, and I don't think 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the Williams 

decision came like a bolt out of the blue, then?

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, that's probably how the 

Government viewed it, Your Honor. But certainly I don't 

think one should ascribe for purposes of implied repeal, 

in other words to assume a presumption, by making the 

Congress prescient of what this Court was going to 

decide in 1995. And I certainly wouldn't concede, 

although the Petitioner would like to argue, that 

Williams' holding is as broad as it is. Williams was 

about a very particular situation, a woman, as I said, 

who had a lien placed on her, and the Court didn't 

answer this question of whether someone who had, as 

Justice Ginsburg indicated, who had a levy placed on 

there, could be a taxpayer within the meaning of 1346 as

 Justice Kennedy, also on your question about 

the tax code, although we don't cite it in our brief, 

Estate of Ramani is another case in which this Court had 

in effect held that a specific provision in the tax 

code, in this very Tax Lien Act, took priority over a 

more general provision that had to do with the priority 

of the United States' claims. And that's Estate of

 MR. AINSA: The Government argues that A.S. 

Kreider has relevance to this case and I will submit to 

the Court that it does not. The analysis in A.S. 

Kreider about a more specific statute following a 

general statute controlling was based upon the peculiar 

syntax of the statute in question. The analysis in A.S. 

Kreider was that the more general statute was phrased in 

the negative and that therefore all it did was set an 

outside time limit that Congress was free to shorten 

with a subsequent statute. We do not have that

situation in this case. There was -- there is no 

similar analysis that you can apply to 1346 and 7426.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And both statutes in 

Kreider I take it applied to the refund suit?

 MR. AINSA: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So there were two statutes 

bearing on the same remedy.

 MR. AINSA: Two statutes bearing on the same 

remedy. And I submit that the A.S. Kreider analysis is 

not relevant here.

 The Government ALSO relies on Brown versus 

the General Services Administration for the proposition 

that a very detailed, complete, balanced, structured 

statute will control over a more general statute, and 

the argument is of course that 7426 is that type of 

statute. But the problem is in the Brown case we were 

dealing, the Court was dealing, with the Civil Rights 

Act and the Civil Rights Act was clearly the first piece 

of legislation that had been enacted by Congress to 

remedy Federal employment discrimination. It was a 

brand new remedy.

 In the case before the Court today, 7426 was 

a response to a particular issue that was raised in 1966 

and that was that claimants who desired to seek redress 

from the Government when their property was taken were

suing the director. They were suing the tax collector. 

This was just a statute to give them a remedy directly 

against the Government. It wasn't creating a brand new 

situation. It was clarifying that now you could sue the 

Government directly as opposed to the tax collector. 

And in fact, the Federal Tax Lien Act prohibited suits 

against Government officials, as was previously the 

practice in the United States. And so it's, this issue 

of implied repeal with the shorter statute I don't 

believe is apropos to the situation that confronts us 

here.

 And I would like to also simply conclude my 

argument with regards to the Government's contention 

that the Government needs to know. In this particular 

case the tax years in question were 1981 through 1984. 

The Government did not assess the taxpayer until 1993 

and 1994, 12 years after the first tax year. The 

government did not levy until 1999, which was 18 years 

after the first tax year. During this time the 

Government knew, very clearly knew, what the situation 

was in this case and for whatever reason did not take 

prompt action.

 Therefore, on behalf of the Petitioner, I 

ask that you reverse and send this case back to the 

district court for proceedings under the refund statute.
