3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next this morning in Case No. 11-597, Arkansas Game & 

Fish Commission v. The United States. 

6  Mr. Goodhart. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. GOODHART 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. GOODHART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  The issue is whether temporary flooding can 

12 ever constitute a taking under the Fifth Amendment. The 

13 Federal Circuit said, no, never, ruling that the 

14 permanent consequences of the Government's actions were 

not relevant solely because its actions were not 

16 permanent. 

17  Respectfully, Your Honors, that cannot be 

18 the rule. There are at least two reasons why. 

19  First, the United States must provide just 

compensation when its direct physical invasion 

21 substantially intrudes upon a landowner's protected 

22 property interest, regardless of the particular mode or 

23 duration of that invasion. 

24  And, second, the Federal Circuit's decision 

conflicts with fundamental guarantees that the Takings

1 Clause is intended to preserve, and, therefore, is 

2 manifestly unjust. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about this Court's 

4 precedent in, what is it, the Sanguinetti case, where 

the Court said that for there to be Government 

6 responsibility it is at least necessary that the 

7 overflow constitute a permanent invasion of the land 

8 amounting to an appropriation, not merely an injury, to 

9 property?

 We would have to withdraw or modify that 

11 statement, would we not, if you -- if your -- your 

12 argument prevails? 

13  MR. GOODHART: Justice Ginsburg, we would 

14 say that you would not have to overrule Sanguinetti 

because the language there, "permanent flooding 

16 invasion," was -- was not how the case turned on the 

17 result. The court there did make an inaccurate summary 

18 of the early flood-taking cases -- Pumpelly, Lynah, and 

19 Kress. None of those cases said that flooding had to be 

permanent. The facts in those cases did have a 

21 permanent condition of flooding, but that was not made a 

22 requirement. And none of those cases said that you 

23 could not have temporary flood invasions. 

24  But, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Was Sanguinetti -- had we 

4

25

Official 

1 had any temporary takings cases before Sanguinetti? 

2  MR. GOODHART: Justice Scalia --

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: In other words, was 

4 Sanguinetti expressing a special rule for flooding, or 

was it -- was it simply saying there can't be a 

6 temporary taking? If the latter, that dictum if it's 

7 dictum or a holding if it was a holding has already been 

8 overruled by our later temporary takings cases. 

9  MR. GOODHART: Justice Scalia, there --

you're correct. There was no temporary takings prior to 

11 Sanguinetti. The Court there didn't have occasion to 

12 address temporary flooding, whether that could 

13 constitute a taking. And all of the cases after 

14 Sanguinetti that have actually addressed whether a 

direct temporary invasion will -- that substantially 

16 intrudes upon property interests have held that, yes, 

17 you can have a temporary --

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Which ones? Because I 

19 counted eleven cases which either say, state, some seem 

to hold or support the proposition that when it's 

21 temporary with a flood it's a trespass, and where it's 

22 permanent it's a taking. Okay? 

23  I mean, I have eleven. And so I've got from 

24 my law clerk. And then I tried to see, well, what are 

the ones that say the opposite? And so far we've come

1 up with zero. All right? 

2  You could argue that there were three cases 

3 during the war which might be read that way, though they 

4 don't quite mention it. All right?

 So which of the cases that you -- rather 

6 than list my eleven, I'm more interested in what you 

7 think, and so I'd like to know which are the ones you 

8 think support -- with something like a flood, which it's 

9 not -- you're not physically taking hold of the whole 

thing. You're sending something in that comes back. 

11 Which of the ones support you that temporary is not a 

12 trespass, temporary is a taking? 

13  MR. GOODHART: Justice Breyer, in the 

14 Dickinson case in 1947 where the Court found a taking 

from flooding, Mr. Dickinson reclaimed his property, 

16 effectively reclaimed most of the property that had 

17 flooded, effectively ending the flood invasion. And the 

18 Court there said the taking was a taking when that 

19 occurred, regardless of whether the landowner does 

reclamation. 

21  Of course, this Court in the war seizure 

22 cases, in General Motors, Petty Motor, Pewee Coal, 

23 Kimball Laundry, in all of those cases the Court has 

24 found --

JUSTICE BREYER: Dickinson -- I got written

2  MR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor. 

3  JUSTICE BREYER: Kimball Laundry. Kimball 

4 Laundry was the -- laundry facilities.

 MR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: They took the laundry 

7 facilities for 3 years, but there what they did is they 

8 went in and they took this building, you know, took the 

9 whole thing.

 MR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: The problem with a flood is 

12 you don't take all the land. You send some stuff in. 

13 And the stuff is there for a while, and then it comes 

14 back, and -- it's called water. And so I don't know 

what to make of the cases like Kimball Laundry where you 

16 actually appropriate the property. I suspect that they 

17 are not quite the same. 

18  Anything else? I got Dickinson. I've got 

19 Kimball Laundry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We have cases about flying 

21 overland -- -

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, Causby. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- cases about shooting --

24 shooting overland. Right?

 MR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor. The Causby

1 case --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not water, but it 

3 ain't taking, either, in the -- in the narrow sense that 

4 Justice Breyer has talked about.

 MR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the 

6 United States flooded the air over the Causby's 

7 residence and commercial chicken farm. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but in Causby, what 

9 they did -- there was a question about whether just 

flying some airplanes over is a taking or a trespass. 

11 But it went on for 25 years, so it was a long time. 

12 And, therefore, the permanency of it I don't think is at 

13 issue there. 

14  MR. GOODHART: Yes. Your Honor, in this 

case, the court -- the Court of Federal Claims found 

16 that these deviations resulted, in over 8 years, 6 

17 consecutive years of recurring flood invasions during --

18 during the summertime, during unnatural time periods; 

19 and that the facts were more compelling than even in 

Causby with the -- the overflights or in Portsmouth 

21 Harbor with cannon shots flooding the air over 

22 Portsmouth Landing Harbor Hotel. 

23  This -- these flood invasions happened each 

24 year for specific sustained time periods. The United 

States controlled the timing, the frequency, and the

1 extent of the duration of these floods. 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: What if it hadn't harmed 

3 the timber? I mean, you know, the damages claimed are a 

4 lot -- a lot of the timber that -- that would have been 

valuable was -- was impaired by these floodings. 

6 Suppose there'd been no harm at all? Suppose it had 

7 just been for a certain period of time you were not able 

8 to use that land for anything? You couldn't plant 

9 anything on it. You couldn't picnic on it. You 

couldn't do anything. Would that have been --

11 nonetheless, despite the fact that there -- there was no 

12 harm done except -- except the flooding -- would that 

13 have been a taking? 

14  MR. GOODHART: Your Honor, no. If -- there 

would not have been a taking unless the landowner could 

16 show substantial intrusion upon his protected property 

17 rights. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he has. It's 

19 flooded. He can't --

MR. GOODHART: If -- Your Honor, if he can 

21 show that the -- he has the right to exclude 

22 superinduced invasions of water, that -- so it doesn't 

23 interfere with his use and enjoyment. Here --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: It does. He can't plow on 

it. He can't picnic on it. How does that not interfere

2  MR. GOODHART: Well, and it very may well, 

3 Your Honor. And here, that -- there was that --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: So it would be a taking. 

Are you saying yes or no? What is it? 

6  MR. GOODHART: I'm saying, yes, if he can 

7 show that it intruded on his use and enjoyment, and as 

8 you said, indicated, that type of interference, yes. It 

9 would be a -- it would be a substantial intrusion on his 

rights to use his property --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that would cover a 

12 one-time flood. 

13  MR. GOODHART: Not necessarily, Justice 

14 Ginsburg. A one-time flood that is extensive, it could 

kill all the trees on this management area in one flood. 

16 However, one flood may not result in substantial 

17 intrusion on protected property rights. So it's going 

18 to depend on the facts, Your Honor, in the case. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't understand that. 

You said if -- if it's one flood, even though it 

21 destroys the trees, and certainly would not make --

22 would make it impossible to have picnics, what -- so if 

23 that's your position, then you're turning on it happened 

24 six times, not once. Is that --

MR. GOODHART: And, Your Honor, what I'm 

10

25

Official 

1 saying, it's a proof of facts. The physical takings 

2 analysis is the same. The legal analysis is the same. 

3 But one flood could effectively destroy timber if it is 

4 a lake; if it sits there.  We didn't have that in our 

case. 

6  We had intrusion during 1993 to 2000, 8 

7 years, 6 of which were substantially throughout the 

8 summer where this management area sat in water during 

9 June, July, into August, basically, stagnated water that 

choked the oxygen from the roots of these trees. And in 

11 1999 it was termed a brownout. It was massive. 

12  Once the timber inventory was done, it 

13 revealed that there was over 100,000 trees in a 

14 6,990-acre area that were either destroyed or were --

were in the process of dying. And that didn't include 

16 the other 11,000 acres that we subsequently inventoried. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, all of our 

18 cases in this temporary versus permanent, as I read the 

19 cases and I read what the multiple facts that each are 

relying on, it seems to me that our cases have been 

21 attempting, in the term "temporary," to encompass a lot 

22 of different concepts. Both intentionality, because an 

23 accidental issue is not a taking; causation: Did this 

24 -- and that's part of Sanguinetti's holding -- did what 

the Government do actually and directly cause the injury

1 at issue? And foreseeability: Is what you intended 

2 something whose consequences you could have seen? 

3  And they are using that in a multifaceted 

4 test, one that the Solicitor General is not trying to 

endorse here, but one that I think is more consistent 

6 with our general jurisprudence in this area. 

7  So there is never a simple answer on the 

8 question of permanent damage, because you can have 

9 permanent damage that's not a taking, if all of the 

other factors I've just mentioned are not in your favor. 

11 Is that correct? 

12  MR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor, you're 

13 correct. The -- the invasion has to be direct by the 

14 United States.

 The Court of Federal Claims found that --

16 that it was direct, natural, and probable -- the results 

17 were -- from the Government's action. 

18  One thing in water cases is you don't have 

19 dye in the water. Mr. Causby could look up and see the 

insignia on the airplanes. And we knew that the cannon 

21 fire from the -- from the artillery was coming over the 

22 Portsmouth Harbor's land was from the Government. The 

23 water, you can't always tell. And so you have to prove 

24 that that was directly from the United States. And the 

commission in this case did.

Official 

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I guess the problem with 

2 this case, and it's part of what's interwoven in your 

3 adversary's arguments, is that with flooding it's going 

4 to occur naturally anyway. The Government generally 

builds dams to control that flooding to the benefit of 

6 all of the interests along its affected route. And at 

7 some point, either the Government is going to -- is 

8 going to make a decision that's going to help someone 

9 and potentially hurt someone. And the question is, 

isn't all of those situations going to be subject to 

11 litigation. 

12  The Government's rule -- I call it the 

13 Government's rule, but it's -- is basically simple. It 

14 can't. Because, if the deviation is temporary -- and 

that's what the circuit below said -- it's just 

16 exercise. It's either a nuisance or temporary trespass, 

17 and we're not going to hold the Government responsible 

18 for that loss. Assuming it's going to occur in part 

19 because flooding is always going to occur, the question 

is perhaps when. But in any place you have a dam, it's 

21 there because flooding was happening. 

22  Isn't that the basic argument? And I don't 

23 know that you've actually announced the rule that 

24 addresses the essence of the policy considerations that 

are driving the Government decision. So tell me how

1 your rule makes this a manageable situation. 

2  MR. GOODHART: Your Honor, the -- the two 

3 elements of the rule, that there must be direct physical 

4 invasion by the United States and not from some other 

cause, and there must be substantial intrusion upon 

6 these protected property rights, the right to exclude, 

7 the right to use and enjoy, and the right to dispose, 

8 that --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's every flood.

 MR. GOODHART: That runs throughout 

11 this Court's --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's every flood. 

13  MR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor, it is. But 

14 the United States, when it does its flood control --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no, I don't 

16 -- why is that every flood? You go through your three 

17 factors, you could have lots of flood that aren't a 

18 substantial intrusion. You know, you get an extra inch 

19 of water, and then it recedes. And it's -- you know --

MR. GOODHART: That's --

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you get a note 

22 from the Corps of Engineers saying, we're sorry, it 

23 won't happen again. That's not -- every flood is not --

24  MR. GOODHART: Not -- you're correct, 

Mr. Chief Justice. Every flood is certainly not rising

1 to the level of a taking. 

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess what we're asking 

3 you is, how do you define the baseline of protected 

4 expectations for the property?

 MR. GOODHART: Your Honor --

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You've indicated, I think, 

7 in your brief that one year won't do it. This was six 

8 or seven years. 

9  If that's a baseline of expectations, the 

Government cannot change that, even if it thinks that 

11 there is a higher and -- and more urgent priority in 

12 protecting some other land? 

13  MR. GOODHART: Your Honor, the -- certainly, 

14 the Government is not the insurer of -- of flood 

control, how they just carry it out. 

16  There is the case that's cited in the 

17 Government's brief, United States v. Sponenbarger, which 

18 says that very thing. The United States is not the 

19 insurer of it. But when it takes water and it controls 

water and releases it in a manner that's not from 

21 storms, not from natural, but does it in a manner that 

22 they control how it's released and the duration, 

23 frequency, and they use property to store that water for 

24 eight -- you know, over eight years, that in this case 

was -- was compelling. And the court found that those 

15

25

Official 

1 facts --

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But my question is how do 

3 you define the baseline that gives a legitimate 

4 expectation, if the Corps of Engineers -- did not happen 

in this case, but in the hypothetical case -- makes the 

6 finding that there is a more urgent and -- and a higher 

7 priority for other lands, and it changes its policy? It 

8 cannot do that? 

9  MR. GOODHART: Your Honor, it can go through 

its law, the National Environmental Policy Act, the 

11 Clean Water Act. It can make changes, and then it can 

12 pay for what it's going to take from private landowners. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what you're saying 

14 is that it can't make that change without paying, right?

 MR. GOODHART: It -- it cannot make that 

16 change where it's going to burden the landowner and 

17 interfere with that -- those property rights that the 

18 Fifth Amendment is guaranteeing. 

19  Now, in practice --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now suppose, at the very 

21 outset of the dam, the -- the Government says, we've got 

22 to put this water someplace, we're going to put it on 

23 the left bank, not the right bank. That's not a taking 

24 as of that time --

MR. GOODHART: Your Honor --

Official 

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- if the land was always 

2 flooded anyway on the right? 

3  MR. GOODHART: That may not be a taking. 

4 And, for example, in the Bedford case in 1904, where a 

revetment was in the Mississippi River, it was trying to 

6 control natural erosion from a cutoff that had been 

7 created, the landowner could not show --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what I want is the 

9 definition of the operable baseline that we can use in 

order to define whether or not there has been a taking. 

11  MR. GOODHART: And, Your Honor, I guess I 

12 must say it may not be a bright line. It is -- the 

13 analysis here that this Court has used throughout its 

14 physical takings cases will separate the torts from the 

takings. 

16  And, here again, the United States -- this 

17 has worked well in other cases for the United States, 

18 where in Sanguinetti there was no --

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Should the baseline be what 

would have happened if the dam was never built? 

21  MR. GOODHART: Perhaps, Your Honor. And in 

22 this case, for example, the court had evidence that this 

23 land flourished before the dam. There was evidence that 

24 this bottomland hardwood forest existed for generations. 

And when the control plan was put in effect in 1953, it

1 worked fine because they mimicked natural flow where 

2 late -- late winter and early spring, you have your 

3 releases, they dissipate, the water recedes, but you 

4 don't have extensive summertime flooding from a river.

 Frankly, anywhere in the country, but 

6 certainly not in the southern part of the United States, 

7 these rivers do not overflow during June, July, August. 

8 This never happens. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: But what do you suggest --

what do you suggest -- I looked at the consent. 

11  MR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: To tell you the truth, I 

13 think it's permanent. I think they're thinking it's 

14 intermittent, but permanently intermittent.

 MR. GOODHART: Yes, Your Honor. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: The flood comes like three 

17 months a year every year. And the erosion, they say 

18 that part that's eroded belongs to the Government now. 

19 And if he comes back with his dirt and puts it in, 

that's fine, but he's trespassing on Government land. 

21  So if I'm right in reading that, if I'm 

22 right -- and a big if -- it seems that eleven cases 

23 somewhat stand for this, I agree, somewhat arbitrary 

24 rule.

3 this stuff. And that would be so absent a better rule. 

4  So what do you suggest would be a better, 

clearer rule for compensating for flooding where our 

6 problem is what's a trespass and what's a taking? 

7  MR. GOODHART: And, Your Honor, I know it 

8 cannot be the Federal circuit's rule that you can never 

9 have temporary flooding as a taking. And I guess 

I would --

19 asking -- which I just did ask -- is what's your idea of 

a substitute that would be better? 

21  MR. GOODHART: Your Honor, the substitute 

22 would be to remain consistent with how this Court

24 regulatory analysis here, but looking at these elements.

JUSTICE BREYER: So a Department of the 

6 Interior employee trespasses on Jones's land, trampling 

7 paths, and even limbs fall off trees. That's a taking 

8 and not a trespass? 

9  MR. GOODHART: No, Your Honor, it's not.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Because? 

11  MR. GOODHART: And because the Court said in 

12 the Cress case, it's the character of the Government's 

13 action, not the amount of damages resulting from it, so 

14 long as that is substantial.

 And in the cases, the Court has looked at 

16 what is substantial intrusion. In Loretto, the Court 

17 said a permanent physical occupation on a rooftop in Ms. 

18 Loretto's building, small area, that is substantial, 

19 even though geographically it was very small, because it 

cut through these valuable property rights to occupy 

21 someone's property. 

22  And so -- substantial may not have to be 

23 very high.

3  MR. GOODHART: Your Honor, I think we would, 

4 again, use the analysis, separate out the torts, where 

the action is direct, it's been predictable what would 

6 that would result in, the United States should know 

7 that, and then the intrusion or interference with those 

8 property rights is substantial, there will be a taking. 

9  Usually that's not going to be the case in a 

one-time situation, as your hypothetical. And, again, 

11 here the court heard six consecutive years of this 

12 invasion of water. The commission couldn't turn it 

13 away. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: So our cases -- our cases 

treat physical occupations differently from other --

16 from other cases, don't they? 

17  The park ranger walking through can hardly 

18 be called a physical occupation. He's harmed the land, 

19 but it's not a physical occupation.

 What you're -- what you're arguing here is 

21 that -- is that flooding the land is a physical 

22 occupation for the period that it's flooded. 

23  MR. GOODHART: It is, Your Honor. Where 

24 it's an occupation, it's certainly clearer and more 

intrusive. There can be invasions that don't amount to

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but what you say --

3 here's what troubles me. You say it has to be 

4 substantial. But you -- can we -- can we fold into that 

word substantial a requirement that it have caused 

6 substantial financial loss? 

7  See, if that were the case, then -- then I 

8 could distinguish your case where a lot of valuable 

9 trees got destroyed.

 MR. GOODHART: Certainly, Your Honor. 

11 Substantial --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: And I wouldn't say every --

13 you know, every flood that goes across a land, even two 

14 years or three years in a row, would not necessarily be 

a taking. 

16  MR. GOODHART: You could look at the 

17 economic part -- yes, definitely, Your Honor. What is 

18 substantial is going to be made as a legal determination 

19 by the Corps, as a matter of degree.

 And you can look at the extent of the 

21 damages -- if there is destruction of property. 

22 Destruction has been -- as in the Kansas City Life case 

23 in 1950, the taking is to the extent of the destruction. 

24 Beyond that, though, it's looking at interference with 

use and enjoyment --

2 case that you are referring to? I don't --

3  MR. GOODHART: The Kansas City Life
 

4 Insurance case in 1950, Your Honor, was underflow
 

invasion of water percolating up on property in Missouri 

6 from the Mississippi River. And that was found to be a 

7 substantial invasion where the property, the 1700 acres, 

8 was taken by the United States. And the Court there 

9 said, when you destroy the use of that property for what 

it was being used by the landowner, you owe to the 

11 extent of the destruction that you have caused. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goodhart, maybe it 

13 would help to know what you think if we accept your 

14 position would be left over for the Federal Circuit to 

consider on remand. You -- you haven't asked to -- for 

16 outright reversal and have the decision of the Court of 

17 Federal Claims be the end of the matter. So if we 

18 accept your position, then what issues would be open for 

19 the Federal Circuit to resolve on remand?

6  MR. GOODHART: We want the remand to say: 

7 Apply the rule of law here for physical taking and look 

8 at it as the Court of Federal Claims did: Was there a 

9 direct physical injury? Did it result in substantial 

intrusion on the commission's property? If so, the Just 

11 Compensation Clause is self-actuating and there should 

12 be just compensation. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what were the other 

14 issues that you just mentioned? You said we couldn't 

ask for an automatic affirmance. 

16  MR. GOODHART: The United States raised 

17 several issues and the commission cross-appealed in

1 please the Court: 

2  As has been pointed out, this Court has 

3 consistently held in its flooding cases and reaffirmed 

4 in Loretto that a -- that a taking occurs in the context 

of flooding only if the flooding is the direct result of 

6 the structure itself and if it results in a permanent 

7 effect on the property such that it's an actual 

8 appropriation. So --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's -- there is 

a little confusion about the Government's position, 

11 there was in the court of appeals. 

12  Is it -- I'm quoting from your friend's 

13 brief, and he says: "The Federal Circuit adopted a 

14 categorical rule that temporary Government action can 

never be a taking if the Government does not intend to 

16 create a permanent flooding condition." Is that an 

17 accurate statement of your understanding? 

18  MR. KNEEDLER: The -- I think the intent 

19 point, I guess I would modify that. There are some 

things that -- I think it would have to be an objective 

21 standard. In Dickinson, for example, the -- the 

22 modification was intrinsically permanent. The landowner 

23 had corrected for it. But it was intrinsically 

24 permanent until the landowner had done something about 

it. So actually Dickinson is consistent with our --

1 with our position. 

2  But I do want -- there is a critical piece 

3 about this case that Justice Kennedy's questions have 

4 touched upon that I think it's very important for this 

Court to focus upon. 

6  This case is not about flooding by the 

7 project itself. The reservoir behind the dam, the 

8 easements, the flowing easements there, the spillway, 

9 the project is the Government and I think it's fair to 

say the Government is occupying the land when the 

11 Government builds the project. 

12  What we have here are incidental 

13 consequences downstream from the dam as a result of the 

14 flowage. And there are -- Loretto, when it is summing 

up this Court's flooding cases, makes two points. One, 

16 it says it has to be permanent, not temporary invasion; 

17 but it also distinguishes the category of cases in which 

18 there is conduct outside the landowner's property that 

19 has consequential damages within the property.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't 

21 understand what you're saying. Are you saying that if 

22 this landowner owned land behind the dam that was 

23 temporarily flooded as often as has happened here, that 

24 that would be a taking?

 MR. KNEEDLER: No. I --

Official 

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I didn't think you were 

2 saying that. 

3  MR. KNEEDLER: No, but what I'm saying is 

4 this would be a particularly bad or problematic context 

for the Court to depart from that. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there are 

7 pretty clear findings in the Court of Claims on the 

8 question of causation, right? 

9  MR. KNEEDLER: I don't think it's a question 

of causation, and if I could just point out two cases, 

11 one of which was cited in Loretto in its summing up of 

12 this Court's flooding cases is Bedford. Bedford was a 

13 situation in which a revetment, as counsel pointed out, 

14 a revetment was constructed in the -- in the Mississippi 

River to protect erosion and access to the City of 

16 Vicksburg. It was -- it was clearly shown in that case 

17 that over time, over a period of 6 years, as in this 

18 case, downstream by 6 miles it resulted in permanent 

19 flooding of land as a consequence of that.

 But what the Court said is that is 

21 consequential injury downstream; it is not occupation by 

22 the Government. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, so if the 

24 Government comes in and tells a landowner downstream 

that every March and April we are going to flood your 

27
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 property so that you can't use it, from now on, that's 

2 the way -- that's part of our plan, that's a taking for 

3 those 2 months, correct? 

4  MR. KNEEDLER: No. I don't think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No? The Government 

6 says you will not be able to use your land because of 

7 what we are doing for 2 months -- you have been able to 

8 up to now, but from now on, for March and April, you 

9 can't. That's not a taking?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I don't, and -- and let me 

11 explain why. What we're talking about here is the Corps 

12 of Engineers operating a dam from which it has to take 

13 into account multiple considerations. In this case, 

14 there was marina operators, there were farmers along the 

river, there were drainage districts. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'll grant you that 

17 it can decide whose land it wants to take. I just want 

18 to know why that's not a taking. 

19  MR. KNEEDLER: Because this is a classic 

example of the Government adjusting benefits and 

21 burdens. This is why the Federal Government was invited 

22 in to construct these projects because along -- along 

23 the river there was very serious flooding. So the 

24 Government puts in a dam to control the flooding, it has 

to release the flood waters, and the timing of the

Official 

1 release of the flood waters is something that you have 

2 to take into account --

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the Government 

4 says we've got to release the flood waters and what 

we're going to do is we're going to have water trucks 

6 pull up behind the dam, we're going to load them up and 

7 we're going to drive them down river to this person's 

8 property and we're going to dump the water there? 

9  MR. KNEEDLER: I think that's a different 

situation because the Government itself is actually 

11 putting the water -- I think that's very close to being 

12 the reservoir behind the dam. But -- but typically, 

13 when the Government -- I think uniformly, when the 

14 Government is operating --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your answer is 

16 that would be a taking? 

17  MR. KNEEDLER: I think because it would 

18 be -- it would be specifically deposited on that 

19 landowner's land.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought --

21  MR. KNEEDLER: It would be the same as if 

22 they put a pipe from the dam --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

24  MR. KNEEDLER: -- to that person's land. 

But that's not what's happening when the Government's

1 operating a dam, and it's operating it with consequences 

2 for the basin. It's not aimed at any particular 

3 landowner. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Again, I think the 

Court of Claims' findings are to the contrary.
 

6  MR. KNEEDLER: Well --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They said the
 

8 Government knew that this water was going to go right
 

9 here, right?


 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, it was not -- there is 

11 no suggestion that it was targeted at this land, which 

12 is -- which is I think something quite different. This 

13 was -- this was an incidental consequence of what was 

14 happening downstream. Again, in the Bedford case you 

had permanent --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: A foreseeable and certain 

17 incidental consequence. 

18  MR. KNEEDLER: No, I don't believe 

19 foreseeable is enough. It was -- it could have been --

it could have been foreseeable in Bedford. 

21  Let me take a more -- a more dramatic 

22 example that I think illustrates this point. This 

23 Court's decision in Sponenbarger which we cite in our 

24 brief, that a -- that case discusses a prior holding by 

this Court in a case called Jackson, which was a

1 situation where a levee, Government built a levee on one 

2 side of the river which had the effect of flooding 

3 property on the opposite side of the river because it --

4 it kept it from going to this side and channelled it 

into the river and it caused it to overflow the -- the 

6 land on the other side, and the Court said that is not a 

7 taking. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the 

9 Government decides for purposes of flood control -- I 

don't know -- I don't know the ecological way -- but the 

11 water has to percolate or whatever down in this area. 

12 So it goes onto this person's land and it cuts down $5 

13 million worth of his trees. The same purpose, to assist 

14 in flood control. No doubt that that's a taking, right?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I think that would be --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 

17  MR. KNEEDLER: Unless there was some 

18 emergency justification. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure, sure. And so 

the Government then comes down and says, we're going to 

21 flood your land and we know -- again, looking at the 

22 factual findings -- we know that will result in your 

23 trees dying, but because we're doing it for flood 

24 control, that's just too bad. Different case when they

2  MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. When they go in with 

3 the chain saw the Government is actually going on the 

4 property and the Government is, to use counsel's term, 

directly cutting down the trees. I think it's very hard 

6 to explain consequences 110 miles downstream as being 

7 direct. It's -- and there is no case that -- that 

8 Petitioner has pointed to with that sort of incidental 

9 consequence --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is the legal rubric? 

11 I mean what you're -- what I haven't thought of until 

12 you've been putting it this way is that the Government 

13 builds a dam. When it does it, water backs up behind 

14 the dam, and that water might flood somebody's land. 

That's a taking, if it's at least permanent, and so 

16 forth. 

17  Okay. Now, the Government builds a dam, all 

18 that happens. Because the Government builds a dam, a 

19 lot of other things happen. They release water 

sometimes. They make electricity sometimes. Different 

21 animals come in. 

22  All kinds of things can happen to different 

23 people 200 yards down. Some will be 200 miles down, 

24 200 -- you know. Some will be helpful, some will be 

hurtful. Can they never bring a lawsuit? Can they

2  MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think, under this
 

3 Court's takings decisions, and specifically those
 

4 dealing with effects caused by something outside the
 

property, I think it is basically a per se rule. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then, suppose what 

7 the Government said is, Mr. Smith, you live 150 miles 

8 from here, and we have a rule, and our rule is you can't 

9 cut down any of your trees, and you can't farm the land, 

and you can't even walk on it without a boat. All 

11 right, that would be at least a regulatory taking. 

12  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, it would be -- it would 

13 be analyzed as a regulatory taking --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: So why -- now, they're 

doing exactly the same thing here, but, instead of a 

16 regulation, they send some water in to do it. So should 

17 we analyze it as a regulatory taking? 

18  MR. KNEEDLER: It -- it has certain 

19 parallels in that respect in the sense that the 

Government has to make a choice. It constructed the 

21 dam, and its releases are going to help someone and hurt 

22 someone. It can't be put in a position where it's going 

23 to have to pay compensation every time it chooses one --

24 one thing or another.

4  MR. KNEEDLER: No.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: They built a dam. It 

6 raised the water level and flooded the petitioner's 

7 land, and the court gave recompense. 

8  MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. And --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you just said two 

minutes ago -- or I thought I heard you say -- that when 

11 the Government builds a dam, even if it floods some 

12 people and not others, that there's no taking.

14 not the -- not the reservoir. And after it goes --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: After it's --

16  MR. KNEEDLER: -- after it goes through --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the baseline -- tell 

18 me what the baseline is. And perhaps you can answer 

19 Justice Kennedy's question more directly. Anything in 

the reservoir is a taking. Anything downstream is never 

21 a taking. 

22  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, assuming it's permanent 

23 in the reservoir, which it's likely to be when the

4 the rest of the year.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: So you could say, just --

7 just as here, that there's only been a temporary taking 

8 of some of the land behind the reservoir. 

9  Now, doesn't the -- doesn't the Government 

condemn all the land --

11  MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. But that --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- even that which would be 

13 only temporarily flooded? 

14  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, but that -- that 

is covered by this Court's decision in Cress, in which 

16 the Court said that if you have a situation where 

17 property is permanently liable to inevitably recurring 

18 flooding, that that's the same thing as a permanent --

19 even though sometimes it's not -- it's not covered, it 

is permanently liable. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the only difference in 

22 that formulation and this case is that it was for seven 

23 years and not permanent? Is that your --

24  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, insofar as we're 

looking at the temporary aspect of it. It wasn't seven

1 years, it was -- it was -- it was a series of individual 

2 determinations made by the Corps; but -- but for reasons 

3 that tie into the downstream effects, it was releasing 

4 water from the dam and was making a series of 

administrative decisions about how to operate the dam. 

6  It has a water control manual. Downstream 

7 landowners are protected, not by retroactive award of 

8 damages under the Just Compensation Clause, but by 

9 public participation requirements --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I must be -- I must be 

11 slow today because I'm -- I'm having significant problem 

12 with your articulation of your test. 

13  Basically, you're saying once a dam is 

14 built -- once a dam is built, no downstream owner has a 

claim? Or, you're building an exception from when the 

16 claim can be applied to a downstream owner? 

17  MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I -- I think, under this 

18 Court's current precedence, there would be no claim 

19 downstream.

21 whether it's permanent, reoccurring --

was permanent. 

6  If I could mention one other point --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just before 

8 you get off, because I think part of the confusion, at 

9 least for me, is the difference between what the Federal 

circuit decided and what you're arguing. 

11  You seem to be arguing that it doesn't make 

12 any difference, it's not -- whether it's temporary or 

13 permanent, right? The Federal circuit thought it was 

14 dispositive that this they viewed as temporary and not 

permanent. So it seems to me that you're fighting, and 

16 you're fighting a lot of the court of claims' very 

17 exhaustive findings, to present a different argument. 

18  MR. KNEEDLER: No. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that 

if we disagree, and we think it makes a difference that 

21 it doesn't have to be 50 years, but it might be 

22 something less, then maybe you've preserved all these 

23 other arguments or maybe not, but --

24  MR. KNEEDLER: But I think it's -- we have 

argued, both below and here, that -- that this is 

37

1 consequential, and that -- that it's downstream and had 

2 those effects. 

3  We agree with the -- with the Federal 

4 circuit, we are not disagreeing with that conclusion, 

because this is -- these were temporary -- a series of 

6 individual temporary decisions made for their own 

7 reasons. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know, but you 

9 agree -- you agree with the Federal circuit, but then 

you're presenting all these other arguments in which it 

11 doesn't depend. 

12  So, if we disagree with the Federal circuit, 

13 it seems to me that we ought to say that, and maybe you 

14 can make these other arguments about it's too far 

downstream or --

16  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, but -- but I think, in 

17 deciding what's temporary, you shouldn't divorce it from 

18 context. And -- and here, the context is the 

19 consequences downstream.

 This is -- this is not -- if you were to 

21 depart from the Court's rule up until this point about 

22 permanence -- and there has to be -- something less than 

23 permanent will do, I don't think you should ignore the 

24 fact that the consequences are not the sort of direct 

governmental occupation of the land like at the

1 reservoir, but the sort of consequences downstream that 

2 affect -- that can affect a whole range of people. 

3  And I would like to make one very important 

4 point about context, and that is, in 1928, after the 

Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, Congress first got into 

6 the flood control business in a massive way, but it --

7 it -- it was unwilling to do that if it was going to be 

8 held liable for consequential damages from flood waters 

9 downstream.

 It therefore included Section 702(c) in the 

11 Flood Control Act of 1928, which says that the 

12 Government shall not be liable for any damage to any 

13 property at any place resulting from floods or flood 

14 waters.

19 Congress doesn't want to be liable.

 (Laughter.) 

21  MR. KNEEDLER: No, but Congress -- no,

23 Congress recognized -- and the legislative history shows 

24 this -- Congress recognized that under this Court's 

precedence, there would not be takings liability. The

1 Bedford decision is, in fact, cited in that. 

2  This Court pointed out in its James 

3 decision, which recounts the history of that, that there 

4 was a proposal to -- to make the Government responsible 

under the flood -- flood control projects for any taking 

6 or any damage to property. And this Court said that 

7 went way beyond anything the Fifth Amendment would 

8 require, and it was cut back. And Congress said it's 

9 not going to be liable for any damage.

 And I think that shows a very important 

11 reliance interest on the part of Congress with respect 

12 to the line that this Court has drawn. Congress was not 

13 going to --

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about --

Mr. Kneedler, what was wrong with Judge Newman's 

16 position on this temporary versus permanent? It said --

17 she said that temporary versus permanent, the target 

18 should not be the Government's action, but the effect of 

19 that action; that is, if trees are killed and they 

weren't revived, the damage is permanent. That's where 

21 we should vote, not whether the Government is going to 

22 do this year after year. 

23  MR. KNEEDLER: I don't believe that that's 

24 correct. I mean, that -- that would turn on the 

happenstance of what a particular landowner had -- had

1 on his property downstream. 

2  And -- and I think the Government, in 

3 operating the general project, cannot be held to do an 

4 investigation of every property owner. Again, it's 

releasing water generally. And if we -- maybe if I 

6 could use the levee example here. 

7  This -- the release changes that were made 

8 here were made to protect farmers so that they could --

9 so that they could plant more crops and not -- and be 

protected during their harvesting. 

11  If you shift back to what the Corps -- to 

12 the Corps' regular operating scheme, it affects the 

13 farmers. There might be a flood --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the issue is who is 

going to pay for that wonderful benefit to these 

16 farmers. Should it be everybody, so that the Government 

17 pays, and all of us pay through taxes, or should it be 

18 this -- this particular sorry landowner who happens to 

19 lose all his trees?

 MR. KNEEDLER: It is in the nature --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't seem to me 

22 particularly fair. 

23  MR. KNEEDLER: It is in the nature of living 

24 along a river. Riparian ownership carries with it 

certain risks and uncertainties, from weather, from

2 thousand square miles, more square miles of drainage

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think -- one of 

those risks has to be the Government's going to make you 

6 pay for protecting somebody else. 

7  Is that one of the risks? 

8  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, when -- picking up on 

9 what I said about Congress, Congress would not have 

gotten into the flood control business without this 

11 protection of liability. People --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: I doubt that. 

13  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, this Court in James 

14 said it was an important condition for Congress getting 

into it, that it was not -- Congress was not going to be 

16 held liable for the -- for the damages downstream. 

17  That came to be the basis, the baseline, of 

18 expectations for people downstream from --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or upstream, under 

your theory. 

21  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, if it's -- but the 

22 construction of the project itself and the flooding of 

23 the reservoir, the Government condemns that land, 

24 purchases that land. It recognizes --

2 that's up -- that's fairly far upstream from the main 

3 reservoir, but it's flooded once every other year. 

4  MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the question would be 

whether it falls within the Cress test of whether it is 

6 permanently liable. 

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your -- but your position 

8 seems to be that if it's downstream, somehow it's not 

9 the Government. There's a series of administrative 

actions and it's not really the Government's water. 

11 It's like -- it's like the old moral refuge that the 

12 rocket designers take: You know, I make the rockets go 

13 up; where -- where they come down is not my concern. 

14  MR. KNEEDLER: It -- it was basically -- I 

mean, it was the rationale of this Court's cases in --

16 in Bedford, in Sponenbarger, and reaffirmed by this 

17 Court in Loretto, a modern takings case dealing with the 

18 question of physical occupation. And the Court said 

19 that -- and it made two points. Again, it said -- it 

made the temporary versus permanent point, but it also 

21 made the point about conduct outside the land that has 

22 an effect inside the land. 

23  This case has both of those features. You

1 project, let's say an electricity plant or high tension 

2 wires, you could require the taking of some land to 

3 build it. Now, you've got that and you begin to run it. 

4 You could run it in such a way that it takes some of the 

property. I mean, the electricity could, for example, 

6 because of some odd thing run around over somebody's 

7 land and kill all the chickens. That wasn't expected 

8 but it happened, and it happened because of the way the 

9 Government runs the plant.

 Now, I guess there would be a taking in such 

11 circumstance if in fact, because of the way it's run, it 

12 makes that land which no one thought would happen, as a 

13 consequence of the project uninhabitable; wouldn't there 

14 be?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, again, it depends. If 

16 the Government -- if the Government is occupying the 

17 land when it happens, yes. But there's -- as you've I 

18 think pointed out, there's a critical difference between 

19 a tort and a taking. And there -- there can be 

collateral consequences of what the Government does 

21 that -- that cause injury. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: The collateral consequence 

23 is to make some piece of land 4 miles away quite 

24 unexpectedly, but totally uninhabitable. Now, what's

the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: What does it say? 

7  MR. KNEEDLER: It says if the -- it had to 

8 do with releasing smoke from -- from a train. And the 

9 Court said just -- just releasing it into the air --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but they made this --

11  MR. KNEEDLER: -- but -- but if you focus it 

12 on someone --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

14  MR. KNEEDLER: If -- if you pipe it -- if 

you pipe it to the person's property, that's a -- that 

16 may be a different matter. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So -- well, 

18 that's the part -- that's the point. The reason they 

19 don't compensate there is it apparently had something to 

do with everybody suffering the cinders. But where the 

21 cinders went out of the train and they ended up on just 

22 one person's property because there were some pipes or 

23 something, then it was a taking.

1  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, here they're focusing

3  MR. KNEEDLER: They're not focusing it on 

4 his land. His land -- first of all, the commission's 

land has always been subject to flooding and, as we 

6 pointed out in our brief, even under -- even under 

7 Petitioner's analysis, it results in an incremental 

8 flooding of 5, 4 or -- 3 or 4 days. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Not flooding that time of 

year. That's the problem. I mean -- yes, flooding at a 

11 time when it wouldn't harm the trees. 

12  MR. KNEEDLER: But it is land -- it is land 

13 in a floodplain that would be suitable for any sort of 

14 construction or development. It is land in a 

floodplain. And they have -- they have not argued, and 

16 in fact, their appraiser in this case acknowledged, that 

17 there is no permanent decrease in the valuation of the 

18 land. They are -- they are arguing only about trees. 

19  And that is -- that seems classic 

consequential tort-type damages, that -- that flood 

21 waters, it -- we'll assume in somewhat greater 

22 increments, went on the land and damaged trees. They 

23 didn't damage the land. In fact, the commission --

3 say that if there was a pipe coming out of the dam and 

4 it went to somebody's -- right to the property line of 

somebody's land and that's where you dump the water, 

6 that would be a taking. 

7  MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. Because --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. I thought the 

9 factual findings in the trial court said that was this 

case, that you knew when you opened up the dam that this 

11 is where the water was going to go. 

12  MR. KNEEDLER: First of all, the Court --

13 the Court did not say that the Government knew. In 

14 fact, it said the Government was unaware -- this 

discussion's between 95a and 99a in the Court of Federal 

16 Claims decision -- that the Government was unaware in --

17 in 1993. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about 6 years 

19 later, when it was doing the same thing and the water 

went to the same place? 

21  MR. KNEEDLER: The taking goes -- the taking 

22 claim here goes from 1993 to 1998. The Court of Federal 

23 Claims said even as of 19 -- at least until 1996, it was 

24 generally assumed that the operations of the dam did not 

have a significant impact below the Missouri-Arkansas

1 line. Again, this is 110 miles downstream. This was in 

2 no way focused on the -- on the commission's land, 

3 but --

4  JUSTICE ALITO: Are you saying there's a 

difference between the situation where the Government 

6 particularly wants the water to go to a -- to a place, 

7 and the situation where the Government knows that's 

8 where it's going to go, but doesn't particularly care 

9 where it's going to go?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I think there's a -- I don't 

11 know about the "intend." I mean, in the hypothetical 

12 with the Chief Justice the Government was actually 

13 transmitting the water. It was essentially using the 

14 land as -- as a reservoir. And that -- that's, I think, 

what Petitioner's counsel was trying to conjure up by 

16 saying the Government was using this land for storage. 

17 The Government was not using this land for storage. The 

18 -- this wasn't the Government's water. There weren't 

19 any outtakes from the commission's land to use this 

water. 

21  These were flood waters, which again the 

22 Flood Control Act says the Government is not liable for 

23 the release of flood waters from a project, that ended 

24 up on the land that is an incidental consequence of the 

operation of a flood control project.

1  People who live in a basin where there is a

4 has long been the case that the way that problem is --

that issue is handled about how it will be released is 

6 by ordinary administrative law principles, basically, 

7 with the Corps, in operating the dam, they have 

8 requirements of public participation. In this case, the 

9 commission participated on ad hoc planning groups.

 This manual had not been updated in 50 

11 years. Corps regulations say that manuals should be 

12 updated to keep apace of changing circumstances, 

13 population changes, different uses, environmental 

14 concerns, so that when that happens, the commission 

acted responsibly here and, had --

that's what happens, but this is not arbitrary. There 

6 is this planning process. There is notice and comment. 

7 There's NEPA --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If there's notice 

9 and comment -- so the choice is, there are 10 landowners 

downstream. The question is which one you're going to 

11 flood. And you flood number 2, and there is a public 

12 process in which number 1 and 3 through 10 get to say, 

13 yes, this sounds fine to me. 

14  (Laughter.)

 MR. KNEEDLER: No, that's not -- that's not 

16 what happens. What the Corps was working for here, it's 

17 commendable. The Corps was trying to develop a 

18 consensus of downstream water users, which is why it 

19 convened this ad hoc working group: The commission 

drainage districts, representatives of farmers, the 

21 marina, the Corps of Engineers, getting everybody 

22 together to try to come up with a -- with a way to

1 essential argument turn on this being indirect, as you 

2 say? This is consequential; therefore, it isn't -- it 

3 doesn't belong in the takings category, anything that's 

4 consequential rather than direct?

 MR. KNEEDLER: We have two submissions. I 

6 mean, it's the confluence of both factors mentioned in 

7 Loretto. And the Court doesn't have to decide anything 

8 broader than that. It's the temporary nature of the 

9 decisions.

 These were individual decisions made often 

11 with a recommendation or concurrence of the ad hoc 

12 committee. So it's temporary in nature -- self 

13 limiting, as everyone knew as part of this ongoing 

14 planning process -- but, also, particularly in this 

case, where it has only consequential effects 

16 downstream, which is, again, the way the Court --

17 including in Lionel, one of the leading cases -- the 

18 Court says that this is consequential. 

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Why should it make a 

difference whether the court had -- the Corps has a plan 

21 which says, we're going to release this water every

4 million worth of valuable timber is gone, please stop. 

We -- we were -- we were pleading. So they knew. 

6  And I think the Court of Federal Claims 

7 found that they -- they had the understanding that they 

8 were using this to accommodate the farmers who were 

9 using marginally low property, that the U.S. Fish and 

Wildlife Service says in the record probably should have 

11 been cleared anyway, but they were wanting to provide 

12 and adjust the benefits for those landowners and use the 

13 commission's property to store the water. 

14  And, Your Honor, I don't know, Justice 

Kennedy, where the line should be drawn, but the cases 

16 of Sponenbarger and Bedford and Sanguinetti say that 

17 when it's not the United States' structure or it's not 

18 the policy -- and the landowner cannot show that, that 

19 it's from storms or from something in nature -- that's 

not going to incur liability. Even negligence may not 

21 incur liability unless it's direct that what -- how it

7 landowner knew that, and that that is -- that is a 

8 cause, not the United States, if -- if the United States 

9 takes away its flood protection and this land goes back 

to what it would be naturally, then the landowner can't 

11 prove that it's direct from the United States. The 

12 landowner would not recover in that instance. 

13  In this situation, the evidence --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even though after the 

dam and the dam's plan was to ensure that it didn't 

16 happen, you would still lose? If natural conditions --

19 caused this, you would lose?

 MR. GOODHART: If -- if it's not 

21 super-induced invasions directly from the United States,
