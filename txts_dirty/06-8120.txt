 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in 06-8120, Brendlin versus California.

 Ms. Campbell.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH M. CAMPBELL, ESQ.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. CAMPBELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

pleast the Court:

 When an officer makes a traffic stop, 

activates his flashing lights, he seizes not only the 

driver of the car but also the car and every person and 

everything in that car. This unremarkable conclusion is 

what Petitioner asks this Court to rule on, rule today. 

This simple rule is not only firmly rooted in this 

Court's precedence, it also protects police officers and 

the liberty interests of everyone traveling on a public 

State highway.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it wouldn't 

apply in a taxicab, right? I mean, the cab is driving 

erratically, the officer pulls it over. If I'm a 

passenger in the cab, I think I can get out and catch 

another cab, right?

 MS. CAMPBELL: Whether or not you can get 

out and catch another cab is sort of a separate issue,

but at the moment that the car comes to a stop you've 

been stopped by a Government means intentionally 

applied, and I believe you are seized at that point. 

After that it may become a factual question with the 

totality of the circumstances and it may be 

significantly different from that, from the question we 

face in a case like this where it's a passenger in a 

private car.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And would that apply if a 

bus was pulled over?

 MS. CAMPBELL: If a bus --

JUSTICE ALITO: Everybody on the bus is 

seized?

 MS. CAMPBELL: Once again, a forward motion 

stopped by government means intentionally applied is a 

seizure under this Court's holding in Brower.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you would have 

no reason if you were a passenger on a bus in the normal 

case to assume that the officer was concerned about you. 

Your view would not be that they are stopping me, you'd 

think they're stopping the bus because the driver ran a 

red light or whatever.

 MS. CAMPBELL: With all due respect, I 

believe at that point what you believe is not 

necessarily the dispositive issue. The dispositive

issue is that your freedom of movement has been 

curtailed by government action.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, are you saying then 

that in a case in which the bus is stopped, the car is 

stopped and so on, the role for the test about whether a 

reasonable person would regard himself as free to leave 

is a test to determine when the, when the seizure ends, 

as distinct from when the seizure begins?

 MS. CAMPBELL: Exactly, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: There's no other role for 

that test.

 MS. CAMPBELL: Exactly, Your Honor. And I 

believe that's the rule we apply with respect to 

drivers. We don't normally formulate it that was 

because usually there's a directive from the officer 

saying okay, you're free to leave, there's a clear point 

where the seizure ends. But --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but you're taking the 

position that whenever you are in a vehicle that is 

stopped, you are seized?

 MS. CAMPBELL: Exactly. Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: In this case, is it correct 

to view this as -- to view it this way: As soon as the 

officer approached the car, as I understand it, he 

recognized the Defendant as a potential parole violator.

MS. CAMPBELL: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And there would be 

reasonable suspicion then from that moment on, for at 

least a brief detention of the individual to determine 

whether in fact there was a warrant for the individual. 

So all we're talking about, the only period of potential 

seizure that we have to worry about is up to the moment 

when the officer sees Mr. Brendlin.

 MS. CAMPBELL: In terms of determining when 

Mr. Brendlin was seized, yes. The -- there --

JUSTICE ALITO: In other words, any seizure 

after that point would be supported by reasonable 

suspicion?

 MS. CAMPBELL: Well, except in this case of 

course, it would be fruit of the poisonous tree, since 

the State has continued --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's the question. 

Do you concede that this arrest was lawful?

 MS. CAMPBELL: The arrest itself -- the 

arrest itself is still a product of the exploitation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you concede that the 

arrest was lawful? The officer was obligated to arrest 

this person, knowing what he did, was he not?

 MS. CAMPBELL: Yes. We concede that the --

MS. CAMPBELL: Yes.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have any case in 

which we exclude the evidence seized incident to an 

arrest when the arrest is lawful?

 MS. CAMPBELL: Well, Your Honor, I don't 

have a case that has these specifics in it. This is a 

new --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't think you did, 

and that's my concern. I assumed that this officer was 

required to arrest the person, and we can have 

hypotheticals, he sees somebody wanted for multiple 

murders and so forth. But I'm just not aware of 

authority which says that when the arrest is lawful and 

the search is incident to that arrest, that the evidence 

is excluded. What's your best -- what's your closest 

case you can give me on that?

 MS. CAMPBELL: Well actually, I would turn 

to the cases that talk about searches incident to arrest 

and also, go back to the rationale for the intended --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can I have one please?

 MS. CAMPBELL: Well actually, let's look at 

Thornton and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Thornton, I'm not familiar 

with immediately. I'll look it up.

 MS. CAMPBELL: Thornton and Knowles are two 

cases that this Court has decided relatively recently

where you talk about the rationale for searches incident 

to arrest. They're not cases that I would have 

considered to be directly on point for the seizure issue 

in this case, but in Knowles the Court held that you 

can't search a car incident to arrest on a minor traffic 

stop because --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. This was the 

search of a person incident to an arrest, and I really 

jumped a little bit ahead of the questions that Justice 

Alito was proposing. There may have been a moment in 

which the officer did not have the authority to act and 

he did, but it seems to me that once he has this 

knowledge, there is now an intervening cause and the 

arrest is proper, and the search as well.

 MS. CAMPBELL: If I can divide this into two 

issues. First we have the issue of the arrest itself, 

and I am aware of no mechanism by which Mr. Brendlin 

would be entitled to suppress the arrest itself, to not 

be arrested on the parole warrant, or to get out of jail 

free, so to speak. That is a separate issue, however, 

than discussing whether or not the evidence that comes 

out of this auto search which is a direct product of the 

illegal stop should be admissible. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's a direct product 

of the arrest, and if the arrest is legal, then it seems

to me the search incident to the arrest is legal. And 

are you acknowledging that the arrest is legal, that 

whatever the exclusionary rule does, it does not require 

you -- when you've engaged in an unlawful seizure and 

you find an ax murderer sitting there in the car, you 

don't have to say sorry, I shouldn't have stopped the 

car. You can arrest the person, right?

 MS. CAMPBELL: And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So the arrest is legal. If 

the arrest is legal, then the search incident to it must 

be legal.

 MS. CAMPBELL: Well, I think we have to 

look, as I said, at the purpose -- the rationales for 

allowing a search incident to arrest are the need to 

disarm the suspect or take him into custody, and the 

need to preserve evidence for trial. In this specific 

case he's arrested on a parole warrant. I can't imagine 

what evidence in that car would be needed to be 

preserved in order to proceed on the parole warrant.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What authority do you have 

that the operation of the exclusionary rule depends on 

the offense for which he was arrested?

 MS. CAMPBELL: Well, the search incident to 

an arrest is an exception to -- to the exclusionary 

rule.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have any authority 

for the proposition you just offered?

 MS. CAMPBELL: The proposition --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The search incident to an 

arrest leads to an exclusion in one case and not in 

another case, depending on the charge on which he was 

arrested?

 MS. CAMPBELL: Well, if what we are talking 

about is whether or not the exclusionary rule should 

apply, we look to the purposes of the exclusionary rule 

which is to deter unlawful police conduct. If we allow 

officers to make a stop on a hunch that someone has a, 

has a, has a warrant or whatever, we have essentially 

reduced the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule as 

it applies to traffic stops, as it has historically 

applied to traffic stops.

 This is, this is not a new proposition that 

if you stop a car and -- if you saw something in plain 

view after an illegal stop, it wouldn't be -- it would 

still be excluded.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, but why -- why 

doesn't plain view kick in just as readily, once it is 

conceded as it has to be, that at the point that he was 

making the arrest, the officer was acting lawfully? And 

if he was acting lawfully when he made the arrest, why

doesn't he get the benefit of the plain view doctrine to 

the extent that he saw any evidence before him at that 

point?

 And I take it the plain view exception would 

at least cover the, I forget what it was, but the 

materials that were in the, in the passenger well of the 

passenger car, that -- that were known to be used as a 

source of, of ingredients for making methamphetamine?

 MS. CAMPBELL: Well, I believe you 

misunderstood me. I wouldn't say that the plain view 

doctrine would allow admission of that evidence. If the 

stop is illegal then anything the officer seized --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I realize. But we've 

got -- we've got a choice here, I mean, I think Justice 

Kennedy's questions brought this out. We've got a 

choice here of two ways to look at the State action at 

the moment of -- of the arrest. One way to look at it 

would be to say it was a product of an unlawful stop. 

Another way to look at it would be to say it was an act 

of executing a validly issued warrant. And you concede 

that they at least could lawfully have executed the 

arrest, they didn't have the arrest warrant but there 

was an arrest warrant issued for them and they could 

lawfully execute that warrant and arrest him at that 

point.

Let's assume that those are our two choices. 

On choice number one the State, the police officer, is 

acting someplace where he shouldn't have been. On 

choice number two, the parole violator, your client, is 

in a place where he shouldn't have been because he 

should have been arrested and he should have been back 

behind bars at that point.

 If we have a choice between those two ways 

of looking at the case, why don't we for any purpose, 

give the casting vote to the lawfulness of the arrest, 

to the warrant which was issued by a neutral and 

detached magistrate at some point? And if we do that, 

then why isn't not only a search incident to an arrest, 

but the seizure of materials which were in plain view at 

the moment of that arrest, subject to a -- an 

admissibility rule?

 MS. CAMPBELL: Well, first, Your Honor, a 

slight correction. I don't believe that there is any 

evidence that this was an issue issued by an detached 

magistrate because what we call in California a Powell 

warrant under California Penal Code Section 3000(v)(a) 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But it was, it was a 

warrant that was lawful for Fourth Amendment purposes, 

is that conceded?

MS. CAMPBELL: Yes. Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MS. CAMPBELL: Issued by the Board of Prison 

Terms.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right.

 MS. CAMPBELL: But in terms of why we don't 

do this, it's the reason we exclude evidence in general 

when it's unlawfull seized, when it is the direct result 

of a -- of a stop that is illegal from its inception.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, all right, but you're 

simply saying we give, we put the greatest emphasis on 

act A, stopping the car rather than act B, lawfully 

arresting, regardless of the legality of stopping the 

car.

 MS. CAMPBELL: Well -- well actually we have 

a test for this. It's the Brown test; it's the Wong sun 

test, and the people have the burden. The test is if 

the, even there is attenuation, which I -- which is what 

the people are arguing, the warrant in this case is, 

that's not the end of the inquiry. We also look at the 

flagrancy of the officer's misconduct, and we look at 

the temporal proximity to the initial illegality. And 

in this case that attenuating circumstance is simply not

have in any of the cases -- I, frankly I don't recall. 

I remember Brown but I don't think there was anything in 

Brown comparable to the lawful authority to arrest 

independent of the stop. And -- and that's what makes 

this case unusual. And -- and if we emphasize the 

lawfulness of the arrest, quite independent of the 

circumstances of the stop, and we also bear in mind that 

the point of the exclusionary rule is -- is to deter 

police conduct, and you've got another priority here, 

the driver, who can invoke the exclusionary rule and 

deter police misconduct.

 I don't see where the interest would lie in, 

or where the justification would lie, in our saying 

we've got to put, as it were all the eggs in the basket 

of the unlawful stop, as opposed to the basket of the 

lawful arrest.

 MS. CAMPBELL: Well, Your Honor, I think, 

actually I'm not sure that the driver in this case is 

going to have a remedy. If we look at the steps in this 

case, first we have this officer who makes an illegal 

stop. He continues that detention in order to run 

warrant checks on both parties; he finds probable cause 

to arrest Mr. Brendlin; he searches the car incident to 

the arrest, even though the Belton rationale search 

incident to arrest perhaps is a bit shaky in the case,

because Mr. Brendlin is in the back of the car, and it's 

a parole warrant.  But at that point the officer also 

searches the driver, and if the evidence is, or if the 

taint is attenuated, as to Mr. Brendlin, and this is a 

lawful search incident to his arrest, I don't really 

understand how the driver is going to have a remedy as 

well. And in fact --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do we have an -- an 

argument that something was seized from the driver that 

should not have been seized from his person?

 MS. CAMPBELL: The driver is not a party to 

the appeal, but she was convicted, and -- and -- and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I mean, that's 

not before us.

 MS. CAMPBELL: No, it's not.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We're talking about 

evidence seized from the defendant.

 MS. CAMPBELL: No, Your Honor. I was 

responding to the question doesn't the driver have a 

remedy? You know, isn't that enough to provide 

deterrence? But if we allow a warrant by one person of 

the car to attenuate the search, search of the car, then 

as I read this Court's precedents, the search is 

attenuated, the taint is --

Court as far as I could tell was thinking that it turns, 

if you stop somebody, you stop somebody, if you make him 

think he isn't free to go.

 So you seem to me to give a lot of cases 

where he would feel free to go, and you're saying still 

that that's a stop. Well, I mean, suppose the policeman 

comes along and he sees three people in a car and there 

is Jack the Ripper driving. So he says okay, I'm 

stopping the car. Now he says the other three people, 

I'm not interested in you; my pal and partner here is in 

a second squad car; he will take you wherever you want 

to go. Have they been stopped?

 MS. CAMPBELL: Have they been stopped by the 

initial seizure?

 JUSTICE BREYER: No.

 MS. CAMPBELL: The initial stop of the car, 

yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Well, I don't think 

you're going to find authority for that in the law. At 

least not in this Court. I mean, I'd like to know what 

it is. Maybe you are. I think that would be very 

interesting.

 MS. CAMPBELL: The car crashed into it. But 

the, the crucial question, the crucial issue was was

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if the car -- you 

know, the car doesn't come to a complete stop. The same 

facts that Justice Breyer just gave you. It's creeping 

along at, you know, a foot a minute. And then he says 

to these other people, you can jump out and go wherever 

you like, or you know, or go back to, to my partner's 

car. Then they wouldn't have been stopped; is that 

right?

 MS. CAMPBELL: I think then we'd have a 

totality of the circumstances test and whether someone 

feels free to leave and jump out of a moving car. But I 

-- I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're putting all the 

eggs into the basket that the, the car came to a 

complete stop and therefore they have been seized. And

what is crucial for the seizure is the elimination on 

motion on the part of the car.

 MS. CAMPBELL: That's how --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Any elimination of motion 

in a vehicle in which you are the passenger constitutes, 

at the request of the authorities, constitutes a 

seizure?

intentionally implied, yes. I think that's, that's how 

Hodari --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But not if you're still 

rolling a little bit, a foot a minute.

 (Laughter.)

 MS. CAMPBELL: Well, then it would be 

totality of the circumstances test.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It seems to me that you're, 

you're blending two tests together, and tell me if I'm 

wrong. One test is there is no question that if the 

police get control over people, those people are not 

free to go.

 MS. CAMPBELL: Yes.

cases. The most extreme example being the -- the 

roadblock. Hodari D, did they -- you know, they were

point of a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes?

 Then you got another category of cases in 

which there is no question that someone is stopped, that 

a police officer can exercise control, and that control 

if so exercised is certainly going to be seizure for 

Fourth Amendment purposes. But we don't know whether 

the officer really is exercising control, so we ask the 

question would a reasonable person in the position of 

the individual stopped have believed that he was free to 

go?

 Aren't those two quite distinct tests? The 

first test assumes the answer to the question in the 

second test. The second test assumes the answer to the 

first test, i.e., they're stopped, subject to control. 

Aren't they two independent tests?

 MS. CAMPBELL: I agree with you that they 

are two independent tests, and as I went through this 

Court's precedents I frankly could not find a single 

case in which a person had been in motion and stopped 

and came to a stop, the physical stopping of motion, in 

which this Court did not find that a seizure had 

occurred.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So you were engaging 

in shorthand? You, you accept the analytical 

distinction but you say look, in the real world once you

stop, we -- we know how the person would have felt?

 MS. CAMPBELL: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: A reasonable person would 

have felt.

 MS. CAMPBELL: I think that what we have 

here, is -- as I said it's really the way we look at it 

with drivers as well. There is a bright line. The car 

comes to a stop as a result of this display of 

authority, you are seized. From that point on when you 

would, when a reasonable person would feel --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but aren't -- you are 

saying, I thought by agreeing with you what you were 

saying was once the car is stopped, a reasonable person 

under those circumstances would not have felt free to 

leave.

 MS. CAMPBELL: I think that's true.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MS. CAMPBELL: I think a reasonable person 

would not feel free to leave.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the officer went, 

before even approaching the car got on the loudspeaker 

and said: "Driver remain in the car; passenger, you're 

free to go"?

 MS. CAMPBELL: I think under the totality of 

the circumstances any court would have a hard time

saying the passenger is not free to leave then, unless 

there is some other intervening, some other factor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you would state 

he is still seized because the car is stopped.

 MS. CAMPBELL: He is seized by the stop, 

absolutely.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then you're -- you're 

blending the two tests together again.

 MS. CAMPBELL: Well, the two different --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You have either got to 

accept their analytical distinction or not.

 MS. CAMPBELL: I do accept their analytical 

distinction, Your Honor. I think it's just -- it's 

actually two different fact, two different points in 

time. There's the, there's the seizure that occurs when 

the car stops; and then there is the continuing seizure 

during the course of the traffic stop which for the 

driver has a fairly clear ending point; for a passenger 

it's going to depend on the facts.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference 

between that situation where the police officer says on 

the loudspeaker passenger remain, driver you're free to 

go, and the example that the State has in their brief, 

in which a car is stopped and as a result of the way 

it's stopped on a narrow road, the other cars behind

that car are for some other period of time prevented 

from going forward? What's the difference between those 

two situations?

 MS. CAMPBELL: That difference is actually 

addressed directly in Brower. Brower addresses that 

exact hypothetical. It says a passerby who is 

inconvenienced by another stop. There you have 

Government, a Government-caused termination of movement 

but it's, but there is no intentionally, means 

intentionally applied.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So what it says here, 

getting out their quote from it, is it says it does not 

occur whenever there is a governmentally caused 

termination in individual's freedom of movement, nor 

even where there is a governmentally caused and 

governmentally desired termination of an individual's 

freedom of movement. That only when there is a 

termination of freedom of movement through means 

intentionally applied.

 Now, the only way I can -- I mean I say the 

difference between desired is that they didn't want to 

stop him. They are not interested in stopping him. 

That's not our desire to stop him. Our desire is to 

stop the driver.

is no real restriction of any significance, is there a 

stop? I mean I would say Brower, they cited on their 

side, for that language.

 MS. CAMPBELL: Your Honor, where you're 

looking at -- we have to look at the objectively 

observable facts, which in this case are the flashing 

lights. We don't -- I mean the passenger has no 

particular way of knowing what the officer's intent is, 

which I think is why this Court has consistently held 

that the officer's object intent in -- in -- is 

irrelevant to the equation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the passenger, you 

also have to have two things. One they don't 

intentionally want to stop him. Two, he doesn't think 

his movement is restricted. Where both of those things 

are true, then no stop. That's why the people who, say, 

are on the railroad car and they stop the whole train, 

that the railroad says don't worry, not an 

inconvenience: We'll have another train for new 10 or 

15 minutes; just get out, except for car one where there 

is Jack the Ripper -- you know, those other people are 

not stopped.

 Now that's their argument. What's your 

response?

 MS. CAMPBELL: Well, my response is the same

as it has been. The passenger is certainly stopped when 

the car comes to a halt. We discuss in our brief that 

there are reasons why a passenger could, why the car 

could be stopped, as far as the passenger knows, and 

particularly in this case where we have -- whereas it 

was an unreasonable stop, there was no traffic 

violation, neither the passenger nor the driver has any 

reason to know why they are being stopped, and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, does that make 

a difference? Let's say, you know, the car drives 

through a red light and the police lights come on. The 

passenger surmises that it's because they ran a red 

light. So that's a different case? You would say it's 

not seized if he reasonably, objectively, reasonably 

assumes it's because of what the driver did.

 MS. CAMPBELL: No, Your Honor. I would 

still say that the passenger is seized when the car 

comes to a stop.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then why are we 

pointing out that they didn't know? It makes no 

difference under your view of the case.

 MS. CAMPBELL: Well, I don't think it makes 

a difference one way or the other. I was responding to 

the suggestion that the passenger should somehow be 

aware of the officer's intent and know when he sees

flashing lights that it means the driver -- I don't 

think that that's a proper inquiry to determine whether 

or not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, if all 

that matters is the physical stop, what do you do about 

the cases that were talked about earlier where the other 

cars have to stop because of the way -- that's a 

physical stop and yet our cases indicate you're not 

seized in those situations.

 MS. CAMPBELL: That's a physical stop, but 

it's not -- it's not the -- the means intentionally 

applied portion of the test doesn't work or it doesn't 

satisfy it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how do you explain the 

justification for stopping if there is the seizure, for 

stopping the innocent passenger because the driver has 

committed a traffic violation? If that's a seizure of 

the passenger, then it's a seizure without reasonable 

suspicion of probable cause, right?

 MS. CAMPBELL: No. I would say that that's 

a reasonable, a reasonable stop. That's the risk --

when you get into the car as a passenger, you take a 

risk that you may be subject to a reasonable search or 

reasonable detention. But the Fourth Amendment doesn't 

provide any protection for anyone against reasonable

detentions and that would be a reasonable detention.

 Was there a question?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about a shutdown of an 

airport? You know, there is word that somebody has been 

seen walking in with a bag of explosives or it looks 

like a bag of explosives, so they stop all planes on the 

tarmac, shut down all exits to the airport until they 

can ascertain what this bag is. Everybody in the 

airport and everybody in those planes has been seized 

for Fourth Amendment purposes?

 MS. CAMPBELL: No, Your Honor. Some of 

those people in the airport would be in the same 

position as the passengers in Bostick and Drayton, where 

they weren't going anywhere in the first place, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, just the people who 

were trying to leave the airport. They had just arrived 

and they were going to go out to catch a cab and go 

home. They have been seized.

 MS. CAMPBELL: I would say some of those 

people would be in the position of the passer-by, the 

passers-by identified in Brower. Possibly some of them 

would be seized, but it sounds to me like it would be a 

reasonable seizure and wouldn't necessarily --I mean a 

reasonable seizure, there's no Fourth Amendment 

protection against a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it turns out that 

there wasn't a bag of explosives and that no reasonable 

person would have thought. This was a knitting bag and 

some foolish cop thought it was a bag of explosives. 

That would have made it unreasonable. So everybody in 

the airport who is on the way home has been seized and 

has a cause of action.

 MS. CAMPBELL: Given the extreme leeway 

given in airports, if it's so bad that there wasn't 

reasonable suspicion to shut it down, I'd say that's 

probably a reasonable result for shutting down entire 

airports for no reason whatsoever. But under the fact 

that you posited, it sounds like it would be exigent 

-sent circumstances or something else that would make 

that a reasonable suspicion.

 Going back to our, to the test that 

Petitioner asks this Court to adopt, the most important 

thing I can say about this test is not only does it 

reflect what I think is the real life expectation. It 

also protects officer safety by providing a measure of 

predictability for both passengers and drivers and as 

well for officers.

 And I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD E. ZALL

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. ZALL: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 I'd like to respond if I could to Justice 

Souter's point earlier. The State sees this as having 

two distinct components in a situation where a passenger 

is subject to a, in a vehicle that's subjected to a 

routine traffic stop. First, you have the stopping of 

the vehicle, the physical stopping of the vehicle. In 

our view that does not result in a seizure of a 

passenger. It's a show of authority much like Hodari D 

discussed, which is directed at the driver. The driver 

is the operator of the vehicle. When the driver submits 

to that show of authority, under this Court's precedents 

the driver is seized. The passenger is not seized.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even, even when the reason 

the driver is stopped is that a police officer whose car 

was alongside, he looks over there and he sees that it 

is some notorious felon who is in the back seat, and the 

only reason he stops the car is so arrest that felon? 

You would still say that, that the show of authority is 

only directed at the driver and hence it is only the 

driver that's seized?

 MR. ZALL: Justice Scalia, the way I'd

answer that question is to say yes at the outset, 

because the driver is in control of the vehicle. By 

necessity, the show of authority to stop if it's done in 

a routine manner, as was done here, is directed at the 

driver. Therefore --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the right answer. I 

think you're being consistent. You have to say that. 

You have to say that.

 MR. ZALL: Thank you.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, consistent with that 

answer, consistent with that answer, what we're 

concerned with in these cases is not, in cases like 

this, is not literally the moment of the stop, but the 

moment of the stop plus one. And in cases like this 

the -- I take it you concede the question is would the 

passenger, would a reasonable passenger in, in that 

situation feel free to leave. And in the absence of a 

hypothetical like Justice Alito's in which the 

loudspeaker says, all I want is the driver, passenger is 

free to go, and so on, absent something like that, what 

is the argument that the, that a reasonable person in 

the passenger seat would feel free to open the door and 

traipse off?

 MR. ZALL: Justice Souter, I think the, the 

pervasiveness and the commonplace nature of a routine

traffic stop gives --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Have you ever been stopped? 

Have you ever been subject to a traffic stop?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Tell the truth now.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. ZALL: Yes. Yes, I have.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. The heart rate went 

up. The blood pressure went up. But --

MR. ZALL: But I was the driver, I was the 

driver.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Don't you think that a 

reasonable passenger at that point would assume that the 

officer is in control and that, in the absence of some 

affirmative indication that the passenger can go, that 

he's supposed to sit there until this thing gets over 

with? Isn't that the reasonable response of a 

passenger?

 MR. ZALL: No, Justice Souter, I don't think 

so. I think again, because the, the traffic stop is 

such a common occurrence and in the overwhelming 

majority of cases involving a routine traffic stop, it's 

an investigatory stop of the driver. And I think it's 

reasonable for the passenger and the driver to see it

that way, I would submit that if I am a passenger in a 

car and I'm riding with somebody and they, and one 

patrol car signals for the driver to pull over, I think 

the natural reaction is the driver says, what did I do, 

and the passenger says, what did you do? I mean, I 

think that's the natural reaction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The fact that the action 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but the policeman 

usually tells the drive and anybody else in the car: 

Stay in the car. Policemen don't like people jumping 

out of the car. They don't know why they're jumping out 

of the car. And I would certainly if I were a passenger 

not feel free to immediately open the door and start 

walking away, and if I did I would expect the policeman 

to tell me: Get back in the car. Isn't that, isn't 

that the normal procedure, to keep the occupants in the 

car until the policeman investigates?

 MR. ZALL: Well, I think, Justice Scalia, I 

think if the officer did tell you to stay in the car --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, even if he didn't 

tell me. I would have expected him to tell me. I 

wouldn't even open the door because I know he would tell 

me. I know that I'm not free to leave the car 

immediately until he investigates the stop.

suitcase in the back seat? Just the driver, the 

driver's pulled over, and then somebody comes walking 

down the sidewalk, the driver's friend, he opens the car 

door, takes the suitcase and starts walking away? 

Wouldn't the policeman say, put that back, because he 

thought he had seized not just the driver but everything 

in the car, too?

 MR. ZALL: Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

think that if, if the officer -- our position is that if 

the officer does something to the passenger to indicate 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm talking about 

the suitcase. You wouldn't, you wouldn't reasonably 

think someone could just take something out of the car 

that's been stopped by the officer and walk off with it, 

right? Everything, all the contents of the car, are 

seized as well as the driver, right?

though, is like a suitcase. I mean, a suitcase can't go 

anywhere unless somebody does something.

proposition that any time there is a traffic stop in the 

State of California or I guess anywhere in the United 

States all the passengers are free to immediately leave, 

absent some further countermanding officer -- order by 

the officer. I think that's a quite surprising 

proposition. Now, we don't have empirical studies and 

so forth, but at some point the Court takes judicial 

notice and I think indications from the bench are we 

just don't think passengers, A, are or, B, should feel 

free to leave when there's a traffic stop. I just think 

you have no social or empirical documentation for that 

position.

 MR. ZALL: Well, though it's not cited in 

our brief, Justice Kennedy, we have talked with the 

California Highway Patrol who make over a million stops 

a year in California and they treat passengers as free 

to leave.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But I mean, the question --

so I want to know how to decide this case. I understand 

what your position is. But I think the normal instinct 

of everybody is not about boats, taxis, airports and all 

these other examples, but this case. And I, I would say 

if you want to go on instinct I wouldn't think of 

getting out of a car when I'm the passenger and the 

policeman has stopped. But maybe I'm wrong. So when

you asked a million policemen, how many instances did 

they tell you about where they stopped the car and all 

the passengers jumped out and walked away? Was there 

one? Was there one.

 MR. ZALL: Well, I mean -- but I think that 

prudent behavior -- just because it's prudent to do 

something doesn't make it a seizure.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. I never pass a 

police car. I don't care how slow I'm going. I never 

pass a police car. I don't consider myself arrested 

just because that's the prudent thing to do, and it may 

well be a similar situation when you're sitting in a car 

that's been stopped by a traffic policeman.

 MR. ZALL: I mean, I think, I think again 

that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Zall, let's say we 

have just an intelligent reasonable person reads the 

newspaper and says: Oh, they handed down a decision 

today that said the police can order me to get out of 

the car, the police can order me to stay in the car. 

How could such a person feel free to leave knowing that 

it is the law that that person can be told, get out, or 

if he tries to get out, stay in?

 MR. ZALL: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'd say 

that, you know, in the Court's seizure jurisprudence

there is this notion of a consensual encounter. I think 

when an officer approaches a citizen on the street there 

is always the apparent authority. The apparent 

authority of the police is always present. The police 

always have the factual upper hand, if you were, and at 

the traffic stop is no different. I mean -- and yet, 

this Court has repeatedly said that when the police 

approach a citizen, ask for his identification, ask for 

his cooperation, even if the police follow him in a 

squad car, that that's a consensual encounter.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Does it matter if they're 

on the Santa Monica Freeway?

 MR. ZALL: I don't think so.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean it would be pretty 

dangerous to get out.

 MR. ZALL: Well, but that would be a reason 

why you don't get out. But it doesn't have anything 

necessarily to do with the police coercion. I don't, I 

don't think -- most of us wouldn't get out. But that 

doesn't make it a seizure, just like most of us would 

cooperate with the police when the police approach us on 

the street. But I don't think -- if anything, I think 

the traffic stop is less ambiguous. It's clearer that 

the police are not interested in me if I'm a passenger.

Suppose after the stop the passenger in the back seat 

starts to get out and the officer says: Stay in the 

car. Is he then seized?

 MR. ZALL: Yes. Yes, because now the police 

have directed action at him and in that situation a 

reasonable person --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't it mean that the 

authority to cause the person to stay in the car existed 

throughout the stop?

over us in any encounter.

casual street in downtown, if they say, I'd like to stop 

and talk to you, you don't have to stop. There's no 

authority to make them stop. But there is authority for 

the passenger in the back seat of the car.

 MR. ZALL: Well, it depends, Justice 

Stevens. I think, is there legal authority? I mean, I 

think police always have the factual authority and I 

think that's the way the reasonable person looks at 

things. I don't think the reasonable person --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there a difference 

between legal authority and factual authority?

 MR. ZALL: I don't think in this context

there is. I mean, certainly in --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If there's no difference 

then there's legal authority.

 MR. ZALL: I'm sorry, Justice Stevens?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: If there's no difference 

then there's legal authority, which would mean the 

person is subject, is in custody of the officer.

 MR. ZALL: No, I don't think so, any more so 

than Mr. Drayton was in the Drayton case, where his 

compatriot was arrested and the police continued to 

engage him, and this Court found that that was a 

consensual --

JUSTICE BREYER: How are we supposed to -- I 

think it's quite interesting. How do you suggest we 

decide this/ I don't mean the result, but I'll go, I'll 

say yes, you've done your survey of the policemen, a 

million policemen think they're not restricting the 

movement of the passenger. Very few passengers jump out 

of the car, but that may be because they're worried 

about being run over. So you say, well, in fact they're 

restricted, but they don't think they're being 

restricted by the police, or do they? And here we have 

no idea, at least I have no idea. I really don't know 

what the majority think and yet it would seem totally 

relevant. How would we find out?

MR. ZALL: Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, I 

think that in this Court's -- to be consistent with this 

Court's consensual encounter jurisprudence, with 

Rodriguez, with Royer, with Drayton, with Bostick --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But those are encounters 

in an airport where there are pedestrians; there's no 

authority to make the person stay, where here I think 

you've conceded that there is legal authority to require 

the person to stay where he was.

 MR. ZALL: Yes, yes, I do, Justice Stevens. 

But I think the point is that if --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And if it wasn't a seizure 

what's the source of the legal authority?

 MR. ZALL: Well, again, I think, though, 

that it's a question of seizable versus seized. I don't 

think just because the police have some authority that 

that makes you seized. I mean, if the police see a 

citizen jaywalking that person is not arrested because 

the police have the authority to make, to arrest him.

 So again I think, I think that the seizure 

occurs when the police exercise some authority over you. 

I just think the traffic stop is less ambiguous. It's 

clear that the traffic stop is to deal with the driver, 

whereas in the street encounter --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's not, if the

opposite is true, then it is a seizure even though they 

stop the car?

 MR. ZALL: Then, Mr. Chief Justice, I would 

say that it's a seizure that at the outset, again per 

Justice Scalia's hypothetical, that the, the driver only 

is seized at the outset, but then once the police make 

it clear that their interest is with the passenger then 

the passenger would not feel free to leave, and then the 

passenger would be seized.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if they make 

that, even if they make that interest clear prior to the 

stop?

 MR. ZALL: Yes, I think it would sort of 

happen instantaneously.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. They pull up 

next to them and they see that Brendlin is the passenger 

and they yell over: Pull over, Brendlin.

 MR. ZALL: So they direct their action, they 

direct their attention at the passenger at the outset. 

Yes, then I would say the driver is seized by the stop, 

and then right immediately the passenger, the reasonable 

passenger, would not feel free to leave and then he 

would also be seized at that point. But again, I harken 

back to the Court's consensual encounter jurisprudence. 

It seems to me that again the straight encounter is more

anxiety-forming for the citizen because the police have 

directed their attention at you.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It may be that you can 

walk away, you're not in an enclosed space. Suppose the 

passenger knows when the police approaches: Oh my 

goodness, I didn't buckle up. Would that passenger be 

the object of the police authority from the start?

 MR. ZALL: Well, in your hypothetical, 

Justice Ginsburg, the passenger would not be an innocent 

passenger and the Court's test presupposes an innocent 

person. So we can't really ask the question from the 

perspective of the seatbelt violator.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it could be, it could 

be sometimes the attention is directed at the driver, 

but that's not always the case.

 MR. ZALL: Again, I -- as Justice Souter 

indicated, I think you have to, you have to break it up. 

At the outset, the show of authority is by nature of 

the, of the vehicle, is directed at the driver. After 

the vehicle comes to a stop, the police could manifest 

some interest in the passenger and then that changes 

things.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But on your earlier answer 

to Justice Ginsburg, there's no authority in this Court 

to say that whether you deem yourself stopped or not

depends on whether think you're innocent. There's zero 

authority for that, right?

 MR. ZALL: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Correct me if I'm wrong.

 MR. ZALL: No, that's correct. That's 

correct. The perspective must be -- we must look at it 

from the innocent passenger and whether the innocent 

passenger would as a result merely of the stop of the 

car feel free to leave.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Going back to Justice 

Stevens' question, the passenger knows the minute the 

red light goes on that the police can either tell them 

to get out or tell him to stay in. He knows at that 

very moment. That seems to me to substantially limit 

his freedom of action and indicates that --

MR. ZALL: Well, again I think factually 

citizens when they encounter police always know -- I 

mean, the policeman in any encounter is armed, is 

typically armed, and has apparent authority over you. 

And yet this Court has repeatedly held that that in and 

of itself, although it may cause some anxiety on the 

part of citizen --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but isn't your case 

he doesn't in fact have the authority, he has apparent 

authority, but in this case he has actual authority, not

just apparent authority?

 MR. ZALL: But Justice Stevens, again I 

don't think that the reasonable innocent passenger is --

this Court has never said it's the reasonable innocent 

passenger that knows the Supreme Court's Fourth 

Amendment jurisprudence by heart. I mean --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying he doesn't 

have actual authority. If I understand you, you're 

saying he has no authority to stop an innocent passenger 

from walking away. Aren't you saying that? Unless 

there's some reason to hold a person in the car, he has 

no authority to stop him from walking away.

 MR. ZALL: I think that is the current state 

of the law. Yes, that is the current state of this 

Court's jurisprudence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if I feel, even though 

that's the current state of the law, I wouldn't think of 

opening the door and walking away without asking the 

policeman, do you mind if I open the door and walk away? 

Does that suggest that I think I've been seized?

 MR. ZALL: No, I don't think so, Justice 

Scalia. That just suggests that you're prudent when 

you're dealing with an armed officer.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not the police 

who have authority over the passenger; it's the driver.

The driver's exercising authority. Just because the 

police say to pull over, the driver can take off and the 

passenger isn't seized at that point.

 MR. ZALL: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice. I 

think again, though, that the stop and then the after 

the stop are discrete.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So now perhaps I'm having 

so much difficulty, and maybe others are, because you've 

actually reached a question of law where facts matter. 

That is, the law points us to the direction of what 

would a person reasonably think in general in such 

circumstances, and we can look at five million cases, 

but we don't know. So what do we do if we don't know? 

I can follow my instinct. My instinct is he would feel 

he wasn't free because the red light's flashing. That's 

just one person's instinct. Or I could say, let's look 

for some studies. They could have asked people about 

this, and there are none. Or I could say, well, you're 

the State of California, you're the ones able to get the 

studies; you could tell some of those professors, you 

know, to stop thinking about whatever they're thinking 

about and go ask a few practical questions, but you 

didn't.

 What should I do? Hold that against you? 

Look for more studies? Follow my instinct?

MR. ZALL: I think, Justice Breyer, again I 

would keep coming back to the Court's consensual 

encounter jurisprudence. I think you could ask some of 

the same questions about in the Drayton case, in the 

Bostick case, in the Royer case. But if you accept 

those at consensual, then I'm not sure that this is any 

less consensual here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe we can just pass 

until the studies are done?

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Zall, assume, and I 

realize you don't assume, but assume for the sake of 

argument, that, that there is a seizure here. What's 

the significance of the arrest warrant, or -- yes, I 

guess there was a warrant as I understand it, although 

it was not on the person of the officer who stopped the 

car. Is that correct?

 MR. ZALL: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. What's the 

significance of that for the outcome of this case?

 MR. ZALL: Well, I think that even were this 

Court to rule that the passenger were subject to a 

seizure, that the presence of the arrest warrant 

attenuates any taint and therefore the evidence was --

was not suppressible.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, maybe our questions 

took your colleague representing the Petitioner beyond 

the question presented. The question presented is only 

whether the passenger felt seized. If we agree with the 

Petitioner, do we send the case back?

 MR. ZALL: I wouldn't, I wouldn't think 

there would be a need to send the case back. I mean, I 

think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why, if we have 

serious doubts whether or not the evidence is 

suppressible? All we've been asked in the question is, 

is whether the passenger is detained.

 MR. ZALL: I concede that that's true.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: While the questions 

indicate that even if the passenger is detained, who 

cares, it's a lawful arrest.

 MR. ZALL: Well, I think that because it's 

fairly clear that the arrest would, would remove the 

taint from the seizure, that there would be little 

reason to send the case back to the California Supreme 

Court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that question hasn't 

been argued here.

 MR. ZALL: Well, I think it's subsumed in 

the question presented and I think it was raised in our

opposition and the parties have briefed it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but there's --

you know, our Brown case establishes a multifactor test 

for determining when the illegal seizure has been 

attenuated and the Court hasn't applied that, the 

California Supreme Court hasn't gone through that test 

in this case.

 MR. ZALL: That is correct, but again I 

think because the warrant is such a clear intervening 

circumstance that has nothing to do, you couldn't in any 

way say it's an exploitation of the, of the illegal 

stop.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But don't we have two 

problems if we go to that stage? The first one is we 

would be applying a test that was not applied by the 

court we're reviewing. And number two, correct me if 

I'm wrong, but the, the -- assuming you win, as it were, 

on the general point about the significance of the, of 

the arrest warrant, there are still going to be 

questions about the suppression of the evidence because 

there are going to be questions about whether the 

legality of the arrest on that theory suffices to 

justify the seizure of the evidence. You recall the 

colloquy I had with opposing counsel about the 

possibility of applying a plain view test here.

Aren't those issues that should all be 

decided in the first instance in the State courts?

 MR. ZALL: Certainly you could take that 

position, Justice Souter. But it seems to me that 

again, that it's relatively straightforward. The arrest 

was valid. I mean, unquestionably the arrest was valid. 

If the arrest was valid, I'm not sure that there are any 

cases --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question that's 

presented is kind of a standing question. It's who can 

complain when the police stop a car? You say the 

driver. The question that's been presented in this case 

is, can the passenger also complain, and that's the only 

thing that we're dealing with. So the -- the arrest 

warrant may pose a disqualification for this particular 

passenger, but that would be a second question. The 

question that is tendered to us and that was answered by 

the California Supreme Court is when the car is stopped 

by the police who can complain.

 MR. ZALL: Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg, I 

agree. And one further point I'd like to make on that 

is, would be to draw a parallel between a parked car 

situation, in which the lower courts have uniformly held 

that no seizure results when the police turn on their 

lights and approach a parked car, and even when they rap

on the window to get the attention of the occupants 

there is no seizure.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No seizure of a 

passenger or a driver?

 MR. ZALL: Of anybody. Lower courts have 

uniformly held that, and yet that seems to be a more 

ambiguous situation and a situation in which the 

occupants' natural reaction would be to turn to each 

other and say: What's going on here? Whereas again in 

the traffic stop I think it's, it is probably the most 

likely place that a citizen encounters a policeman, much 

more so than a, an officer approaching me at an airport 

and saying, can I see your identification, or 

approaching me on a street corner, or, as in Chesternut, 

following me as I'm walking home in his squad car. 

Those seem to me to be more anxiety-creating and yet the 

Court has held that those are consensual encounters.

 And in the parked car, there's ambiguity 

about what the police want, whereas in the routine 

traffic stop there isn't that ambiguity, so there's no 

reason why the passenger shouldn't feel free to leave. 

Now, it might be prudent, as Justice Scalia indicated, 

to say, I'm leaving. But that doesn't make it a 

seizure, that you should act prudently. I think you 

should always act prudently when you're dealing with the

police.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What is this period of time 

that we are talking about when Mr. Brendlin might or 

might not have felt that he was free to leave? As I 

understand the facts, the officer recognized him as one 

of the two Brendlin brothers immediately upon 

approaching the car. Isn't that right.

 MR. ZALL: That's -- that right, Your Honor. 

But again I think, so I think it's just the mere 

presence. It would just be from the time that he got 

out of his parked, of his car after he parked it, and 

then with his lights on approached the car and then 

looks in and sees Mr. Brendlin. So that's the period of 

time that Petitioner would have to establish that a 

reasonable person would not feel free to leave.

 And the -- and the comparison with the 

parked car and the other consensual encounter cases of 

this Court in my view indicate that there is nothing 

that's been done to the passenger. I mean, the arrest 

of one person as this Court said in Drayton does not 

mean that everyone around him is detained so it doesn't 

seem to the State that anything has been done to the 

passenger. He just was unlucky enough to be in this car 

when the driver was stopped for a traffic violation. 

And that seems to me fairly unambiguous and we don't

feel like a reasonable passenger would not feel free to 

leave in that situation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it may be that we 

would say because of the exclusionary rule dynamic, we 

have very little interest in applying the exclusionary 

rule to this but I'm not so sure that we should bend the 

concept of seizure and say that the passenger hasn't 

been seized.

 Perhaps we should be very liberal insofar as 

applying the exclusionary rule and in this case it seems 

to me there is lawful arrest which is intervening cause 

anyway. But I don't know that we should distort the law 

of seizure.

 MR. ZALL: Justice Kennedy, I wouldn't think 

you're distorting the law of seizure by saying the 

passenger isn't seized. Nothing is done to the 

passenger. He happens to be in this stopped vehicle, 

but the police have directed no action toward him and so 

I'm not sure that you would be torturing the definition 

at all.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Suppose 10 or 20 years ago 

we had this case and we decided your way and decided 

passengers are not seized, and then subsequently we had 

the question of whether an officer could order a 

passenger out of the car. What would be held then?

Would we have said we can't because he is not seized? 

Or would you say yes, he was seized. I meant if we 

decided in your case there is no seizure, would we then 

have later on, do you think said, notwithstanding the 

absence of a seizure the officer could order the person 

out of the car?

 MR. ZALL: Yeah. Because I think -- because 

I think the weighty interest in officer safety would 

still allow the officer to have some degree of control 

over the situation. But again seizable does not mean 

seized. The fact that the officer could seize the 

passenger doesn't mean that the passenger is seized.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But in most situations 

where an officer meets a person, unless there is a crime 

scene or something like that, he can't order them to 

cross the street or go someplace else, can he? He can't 

issue any order to a citizen.

 MR. ZALL: But again --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But he can issue orders to 

passengers even though they are not seized.

 MR. ZALL: But Justice Stevens, I think 

that's because of, the Court recognized in Mimms and in 

Wilson that there is something inherently dangerous 

about the traffic stop situation, and there may be 

weapons in the car that the officer can't see, and so

that's why this Court found in Wilson that you could 

order the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but in that case 

there was a blanket rule. The officer didn't have to 

have a specific reason. And that it seems to me 

indicates that that's because the person as a general 

rule knows that he or she is seized. If the officer had 

to give a specific reason requiring the person to stand 

outside as the dissent said, then you might have had a 

point. But I don't think that's what the Court held.

 MR. ZALL: I don't think, Justice Kennedy, 

that the Court ever indicated that the passenger was 

seized in Wilson prior to the order out. I know there 

was a dissent that indicated that the passenger wasn't 

seized and the majority never indicated that they 

disagreed with that point. I think that what happened 

in Wilson is that the Court just felt that -- may I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your 

sentence. Sure.

 MR. ZALL: -- the Court just felt that the 

weighty interest in officer safety justified the order 

out, regardless of whether the passenger was seized at 

the outset.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH M. CAMPBELL,

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MS. CAMPBELL: Thank you. Just to respond 

to that last question very briefly, I agree with Justice 

Kennedy that Wilson could not have been decided the way 

that it was decided had there not been an underlying 

assumption that the passenger is seized, because Wilson 

does not require any reasonable suspicion that the 

person is posing a danger to the driver.

 I'd also like to respond to the State's 

argument that the passenger in this case simply got 

unlucky and he was in a car with someone, that he 

happened to be in a car with someone who was stopped for 

a traffic offense. This passenger wasn't merely 

unlucky; his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by an 

unreasonable stop that was unreasonable from its 

inception. Not only did the officer have no reason to 

make the stop; he had actually called in and verified 

and gotten affirmative evidence confirming that there 

was no reason for the stop. So it --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that -- so that, 

still then, it's just begging the question of whether or 

not his Fourth Amendment rights were violated. You're 

making a good case that the driver's Fourth Amendment

rights were violated, but why isn't the passenger, as 

your friend said, just in the unlucky circumstance to 

have been in a car whose the driver's Fourth Amendment 

rights were violated?

 MS. CAMPBELL: Because Your Honor, this 

Court has -- this Court held in Delaware versus Prouse, 

the Court recognized the passengers as well as drivers 

have a liberty interest in free travel on the highways, 

and because if we look at every case this Court has 

decided in the last 20 or 30 years regarding when a 

seizure occurs, the case of a passenger in an auto test 

-- in an auto stop meets the test. Under Hodari D we 

need a show of authority or physical control; in this 

case we have both. We have the driver response to the 

officer's show of authority and as a result the 

passenger is, is subject to physical control, as a 

direct line.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What have we done in a 

case, and maybe we haven't had it, but what have we done 

in a case where there is a warrantless entry in 

violation of the Fourth Amendment of somebody's 

apartment, and there is a suitcase in there that does 

not belong to the owner of the apartment? My impression 

is that, that the owner of that suitcase has not been 

subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure; is that

correct?

 MS. CAMPBELL: If the person has no 

expectation of privacy in that suitcase that is correct, 

Your Honor. But this Court has recognized in Delaware 

vs. Prouse that a passenger does have a privacy liberty 

interest in free travel. So it's a different situation.

 Once again, going back to the Brower case, 

the, there was some question about whether or not the, 

the seizure of a bystander would be, would be a seizure 

under the rule proposed by, by Petitioner in this case. 

Brower talks about an entirely accidental seizure.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but there was only 

one, there was just the driver in the Brower case.

 MS. CAMPBELL: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There was no passenger as 

I recall.

 MS. CAMPBELL: No. But - but under the rule 

proposed by the State if there had been a passenger that 

passenger would not have been seized. But if we look at 

how this Court --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but I mean in the 

case it's just not directly on point. That's what we 

are arguing about.

 MS. CAMPBELL: Yes, Your Honor. But if we 

look at the case next in line case, the County of

Sacramento versus Lewis case, there was a passenger in 

that case who was struck by the officer in the pursuit, 

and although the Court found no seizure it didn't base 

that on the fact that the person was a passenger, but on 

the fact that it was an accidental application of force.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that's just another 

case that doesn't help us.

 MS. CAMPBELL: I think it certainly informs 

the discussion, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what of the question 

that was raised about well, a passenger is locked in for 

the moment, but so are all the cars that are backed up 

behind the car that's been stopped? What's the 

difference between the passenger --

MS. CAMPBELL: In that case, Your Honor, 

there hasn't been an intentional impeding of those 

people's free, free movement by the officer. The 

officer has intentionally stopped this vehicle. And I 

-- I don't think it's really, it's really far-fetched to 

argue that it's reasonably foreseeable that automobiles 

often have passengers in them, and there is certainly a 

large body of statutory law at least in California that 

shows that the car can be stopped for reasons related to 

the passenger.

 So it's, it's a different situation. We are

not looking at an accidental seizure. We are looking at 

an intentional seizure of the car.

 Just to address for a moment whether or not 

remand is appropriate in this case, just to clarify the 

procedural posture. The intermediate appellate court in 

California did rule this, that the evidence seized in 

this case was the fruit of the poisonous tree and should 

be suppressed. The California Supreme Court did not 

grant review on that issue and it was not, it's not 

included in the question presented. Just for 

clarification. But if the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The California 

Supreme Court didn't have to reach that issue because it 

found there was no seizure.

 MS. CAMPBELL: No. The court did not -- did 

not actually request briefing on the issue either. 

Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the 

above-titled matter was submitted.)
