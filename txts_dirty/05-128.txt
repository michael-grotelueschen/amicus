(10:13 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in 05-128, Howard Delivery Service v. 

Zurich American Insurance Company. 

Mr. Strain. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL F. STRAIN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. STRAIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

We are here about a bankruptcy priority, and 

bankruptcy priorities must be clearly granted by 

statute or they are not granted at all. That's the 

first principle of bankruptcy law that this Court has 

laid down, that equal priority, that equal distribution 

is the first principle, and every priority is a 

deviation from that first principle, and therefore, 

they must be clearly set out in the statute. This 

Court has been very clear over and over on those 

bedrock principles. 

Applying them here, Zurich must demonstrate 

that its workers' comp insurance policy receivables are 

clearly included within the statutory phrase of 

507(a)(4), contributions to an employee benefit plan 

arising from services rendered within 180 days. Judge

Niemeyer -- Judge Niemeyer followed those principles, 

those bedrock principles of this Court. The two 

concurring opinions below did not follow nor even 

mention those principles, and that led them to err, we 

-- we submit. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get you to step 

back just -- the presumption that you began with. What 

-- what's your strongest authority for that? The first 

thing you cite in your brief is a dissenting opinion of 

two justices. 

MR. STRAIN: The strongest authority for 

that, Your Honor, is the opinion in Kothe, K-o-t-h-e, a 

1930 opinion, followed by Nathanson, followed by 

Embassy Restaurant, and it is the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Nathanson is the --

you cite the dissenting opinion for this proposition? 

MR. STRAIN: No. It is -- Nathanson -- the 

-- the citation, the page citation, is to the majority 

-- is to the majority opinion. The principle is laid 

out in the majority opinion, Mr. Chief Justice. And 

Nathanson majority opinion relied on Kothe, and 

Nathanson majority opinion was followed in 1959 by this 

Court in Embassy Restaurants, and followed in 1968 by 

this Court in Joint Industries Board also dealing with 

bankruptcy priorities. That is the bedrock principles

in the -- of the majority decisions of -- of this case 

-- of this Court. 

And what we have here, Your Honor and members 

of the Court, is that a -- an insurance policy -- what 

we're talking about here is an insurance policy, and 

the statutory language refers to an employee benefit 

plan. We don't even have a plan here. We have a 

policy. 

There's a citation in the Zurich brief at 

page 20 to this Court's opinion in Pegram v. Herdrich, 

which I think drives that point home. It is an 

incomplete citation. The omitted language from the 

Zurich brief is as follows. From page --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is the 

unomitted language? What -- what page of the brief are 

you quoting from? 

MR. STRAIN: It's on page 20, Your Honor, of 

Zurich. 

Citing to page 223 from this Court's opinion 

in Pegram, the omitted language, which comes in the 

middle of the quotation given at page 20, is as 

follows. Thus, when employers contract with an HMO to 

provide benefits to employees subject to ERISA, the 

provisions of documents that set up the HMO are not, as 

such, an ERISA plan.

 Now, that is what our case is, an insurance 

policy that incorporates a duty to pay benefits subject 

to workers' comp laws of the different States. So even 

under the citation in -- the full citation in Pegram, 

it is seriously questionable whether this insurance 

policy is a plan at all. The statute requires an 

employee benefit plan. The -- this Court requires that 

it be clear from the statute that this insurance policy 

is itself a plan. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, ERISA -- ERISA makes it 

very clear that -- that a plan to pay insurance for 

employee benefits, whether it's disability or 

retirement or whatever else, is an employee benefit 

plan and -- and explicitly excludes workmen's comp 

because otherwise it would fall within that definition 

of an employee benefit plan. 

MR. STRAIN: I believe that is -- is correct, 

Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I know that's a different 

statute. I'm not saying that the -- that the 

definitions of that statute have to apply here, but the 

definitions of that statute at least demonstrate that 

it is a permissible use of the -- of -- of the term 

employee benefit plan. 

MR. STRAIN: I disagree with you, Justice

Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. Tell me why. 

MR. STRAIN: -- to this -- to this extent. 

The definition of employee benefit plan under ERISA is 

in two parts: a section (a), which is a -- which is a 

listing; and a section (b), which is incorporation of 

provisions of the Taft-Hartley law. And it's under the 

section (b), the incorporation of provisions of the 

Taft-Hartley law, that workers' compensation comes in. 

And, of course it is then excluded by -- by ERISA. 

But a -- the ERISA definition does not 

demonstrate that a -- an insurance policy is a plan. 

This Court has dealt with the issue under ERISA of 

whether everything scheduled in ERISA is a plan or not. 

In the Massachusetts v. Morash decision, this Court 

determined whether a vacation -- unpaid vacation policy 

was a plan under the definition of ERISA, and this 

Court held that it was not. So it is clear from this 

Court's precedent that whether or not something is 

listed in ERISA, even if it applied -- in that case, 

ERISA applied; in this case it does not -- even if it 

applied, would not qualify as a plan. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would it -- would it if 

the employer were self-insured? Can you be self-

insured for workers' comp?

 MR. STRAIN: The employer can be self-insured 

for workers' --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would that be a plan then? 

MR. STRAIN: I think it would not, Your 

Honor, because the self-insurance for workers' comp, as 

I understand them, what they normally do is, just as 

the Court referred to in that omitted section of the 

Pegram opinion, is it simply is -- is an agreement that 

it will provide the necessary wherewithal and bonding 

to pay the benefits as specified, as they may change 

from time to time in a State statute. There is none of 

the other things, as I understand it, that the Court 

dealt with in Pegram which would make it a plan that 

are present in either a workers' compensation insurance 

policy or a self-insurance program, as is permitted and 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it would be an employee 

benefit program, but not a plan. 

MR. STRAIN: It would be, Your Honor, or in 

the case of our case, an employee benefit policy. 

And I would like to pick up on that, if I 

may, because it is not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Before you -- before you go 

on, could you satisfy a curiosity of mine? Maybe Mr. 

Verrilli should be the one I should ask this, but you

must have your -- your version of it. How do you 

decide whether an insurance premium is for work that 

was done within the last 180 days? How -- how do you 

calculate it, whether that characteristic of the -- of 

the statute is complied with? 

MR. STRAIN: Your Honor, I don't know that 

there is any good way to do that, and I think that's 

one of the anomalies in trying to superimpose an 

insurance policy under the rubric of an employee 

benefit plan. 

Now, premiums -- premiums, of course, there 

is a -- there is a mechanism --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, if it said premiums due 

within the last 180 days, I could understand it --

MR. STRAIN: And there is a mechanism in the 

policy to determine the payment of premiums. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't -- doesn't the 

mechanism take into account the number of employees who 

are on the rolls at any given time? 

MR. STRAIN: I believe it does, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if that's the case, 

then -- then doesn't the premium that you're supposed 

to pay depend in -- in -- on the number of employees 

within the last 180 days, which in turn depends on 

their working in the last 180 days?

 MR. STRAIN: It is not my understanding -- and I 

may be mistaken because this policy was not placed in 

the record by Zurich. It is not my understanding that 

that is how the policy premium calculations are made, 

Your Honor. Now --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how -- maybe you just 

don't know the answer. 

MR. STRAIN: -- certainly, Justice Souter, 

you may be right, but we've checked the proof of claim 

filed by Zurich which started this off, and they did 

not attach the workers' compensation insurance policy 

to it. So it is not in the record, and I simply don't 

know --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So that's -- that's really 

not an issue for us. 

MR. STRAIN: Well, I -- I will not say that 

it's not an issue, Your Honor. It is -- it is an issue 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if you want to make it 

an issue, you'd have to get the -- the predicate in the 

record to do it, and -- and we just don't have that. 

MR. STRAIN: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We -- we couldn't resolve 

that.

there's no conceivable way that 180 days makes any

MR. STRAIN: And -- and I -- I think that, as 

-- as I hope may blend the answers to both questions. 

I think that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Consider us together, yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: We're together on this. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. STRAIN: I -- I think that is -- I think 

that is where we -- where we are. We have a policy 

that was not placed in the record by the applicant for 

this priority. We have our general knowledge of what 

workers' comp insurance policies are. We have a 

statutory requirement which reads, a calculation with 

180 days, which I suggest is an anomaly when we compare 

it to the statutory language. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there anything in the 

statute which says how promptly the premiums have to be 

paid as it -- to -- to make it analogous, say, to 

withholding where you might have to pay every quarter 

on -- by a certain day? Does -- does the statute 

regulate when and how promptly the premiums must be 

paid, or is that just all comprehended in the terms of 

the policy agreement?

priority statute does not because the priority statute

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. I meant the State 

workmen's comp law. 

MR. STRAIN: The State workers' -- workers' 

comp law. Your Honor, I -- I don't know the answer. I 

know that the State laws -- I know that the State laws 

vary, and we have 10 different workers' comp laws that 

allude to or mention workers' comp insurance policies 

present just in this case. So it may be that those 

statutes might provide some of the basis for an 

explanation, but I simply don't know the answer to 

that. I did want to --

JUSTICE BREYER: If you have an employer who 

says, I promise to give $200 a month per worker to a 

fund, which money will go to pay their health costs 

when they're sick, that's plainly covered. 

MR. STRAIN: Yes, it is, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And now suppose it's exactly 

the same, but instead of his paying $200 a month, he 

pays $200 to an insurance company in return for a 

promise that they'll pay precisely the same amount to 

the employee if he gets sick. In your view, that's not 

covered.

the focus of the answer should be on whether it is an 

employee benefit or not.

your interpretation, then all those employers who, 

instead of contributing directly to health funds, 

instead buy insurance policies to do the same thing, 

will discover they do not have the advantage of the 

fifth priority. 

MR. STRAIN: All right. And now I see -- now 

I see, Justice Breyer, I did misunderstand --

misunderstand the facts. Those facts clearly are 

covered. They're -- they're covered under --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, if they are covered --

if they are covered, as I thought, then what is the 

difference whether the employer buys a policy whereby 

the insurance companies pays for their health benefit 

when they're sick or pays for their accident benefit 

when they have an accident at work? 

MR. STRAIN: Your Honor, I think the 

difference are -- are several. Number one is what the 

employer is doing here is insuring itself against a 

claim that would otherwise be against the insurer. 

That was not in your hypothetical, Your Honor. That 

makes what we have here a policy for an employer 

benefit. It is not an employee benefit. 

Now, the -- the employer is the insured. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the correlative 

hypothetical would be a plan such as Justice Breyer

that's a contractual obligation of his, and then he

JUSTICE SCALIA: And you say that wouldn't be 

MR. STRAIN: And that would not be covered, 

and that would not be covered in great part because it 

is an employer benefit, employer choice, employer 

benefit. And what we have in this case --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's -- that's a 

better way to put it. If -- if that's right, then what 

you're saying, as I understand it, is in those cases 

where an employer goes to an insurance company, they 

give a contractual promise to pay the employee when he 

gets sick in return for a premium by the employer --

and it's a health benefit or a vacation benefit, the 

most typical thing -- you're saying all those -- all 

those -- there's no fifth priority. They don't --

can't take advantage of that.

 MR. STRAIN: No. Your Honor, what -- what 

I'm saying is and what we have here, if what you're 

describing, if I understand it correctly, is a normal 

fringe benefit. That is, an employer agrees to take 

out a -- to contribute to a pension fund for the 

benefit of the employees. That is clearly covered. 

That was the kind of thing dealt with in Embassy 

Restaurant and the Joint Industries Board that (a)(4) 

was intended to supplant or overrule. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And why did --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's clearly 

covered. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- why did you answer 

Justice Scalia's question as you did? That is also an 

employee benefit, that is, vacation, sickness. 

MR. STRAIN: Your Honor, I answered that 

because, as Justice Scalia changed the hypothetical, it 

was not an employee benefit. It was the employer 

insuring itself, buying an annuity or, like we have 

here, insuring itself, so it -- so it could make the 

payments. 

What we have here, Your Honor, is a situation 

where, as it is admitted in the record, the employees 

don't benefit at all. As Zurich has admitted in this 

record at page 17, the employees are in the same

position whether there is insurance or no insurance. 

In fact, the irony here is that if Zurich prevails, not 

only do the employees not benefit, they are harmed 

because there are in the (a)(4) -- the (a)(4) priority 

claimants are a total of 1.6 million, including the 

400,000 of Zurich. All the others are health and 

welfare funds such as Justice Breyer was -- was posing. 

Zurich is not. 

But what happens -- and there's not enough 

money to pay everyone. What happens is if the Zurich 

Insurance Company receivable gets an equal priority 

with the health and welfare funds, then there is a 

dilution of the money going for the employees' health 

and welfare and pension, a 25 percent, in this case, 

dilution of that money because the employer chose to 

insure itself for its liability, potential liability, 

to the employees. The employer benefited from that 

insurance. In some States, it would be required to 

have the insurance. In most States, it has the option 

of having insurance or not. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Would the same thing happen 

under multi-employer plans? Would not the employees 

typically receive the benefits even if their employer 

did not make the contributions that it was required to 

make?

 MR. STRAIN: It would -- they would typically 

-- in a multi-employer plan, as many of our priority 

claimants are here, because the money is spread, the 

employees still get some money. But if we consider the 

greater whole, the money, the available res, the 

available pot, to play those -- pay those employees is 

diminished. So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there's also, 

isn't there, the Pension Benefit -- even if there's no 

money in the till for the plan, isn't there a 

Government fund so that the worker would receive the 

benefit in any event if -- I don't see the distinction 

that you're making based on whether the worker would 

get a benefit whether or not the employer made the 

contribution. 

MR. STRAIN: Well, Your Honor, there 

certainly is -- there certainly are -- in most States 

at least, there certainly are funds that step in if a 

workers' comp insurer or an employer does not make --

is not available to pay an award to a workers' comp 

injured -- a worker who was injured on the job. 

On the other -- on the other hand, Your 

Honor, whether such funds exist to step in and supplant 

the payments not made to -- in the ordinary health and 

welfare and pension context, I think not, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I recognize there are 

different schemes. The only one I'm familiar with is 

my former State. But did I understand from your answer 

that in some or many of these States, the employer is 

free not to have insurance? He can be self-funded? 

MR. STRAIN: Yes. Yes, that's correct, Your 

Honor, in -- in --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And is there any 

requirement that there be an actual fund in place or is 

it just a general liability? 

MR. STRAIN: Well, there is -- there is -- it 

is a -- a traditional self-insurance with the overlay. 

That is, there -- there must -- there must be a 

showing of the wherewithal, but with the additional 

overlay, in all or virtually every State which permits 

this, of the requirement of a bond. And that's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: A bond. 

MR. STRAIN: -- which is an interesting point 

because if Zurich prevails, we have the -- the camel's 

nose is under the tent because in all the self-

insurance contexts, the bond issuer will have an 

equivalent claim to Zurich. Under their broad 

reasoning or broad interpretation of the statute that 

should be considered narrowly -- under the broad 

interpretation they want, that camel's nose would be

under the tent, and the bond issuer would have an 

equivalent claim to Zurich on its policy. 

To extend that a little further, what Zurich 

did here -- was an insurance company -- it required 

letters of credit of Howard Delivery, the debtor, to 

issue its policies. It drew down those letters of 

credit $1.1 million. F&M Bank, the letter of credit 

issuer, of course sought security from the debtor, but 

not enough. As is commonly the situation once the 

liquidation is finished, there wasn't enough security. 

So F&M, which had facilitated Zurich's workers' 

compensation insurance by its letters -- letters of 

credit, would have an equivalent claim to Zurich as 

well. So more and more of the camel is going under the 

tent. This is a very broad interpretation with major 

implications that they seek and it is completely 

inappropriate under the bedrock principles of 

approaches to priorities under bankruptcy law. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if there were letters 

of credit, why is Zurich injured? Because the letters 

of credit were not large enough to cover the premium 

liability? 

MR. STRAIN: They -- they were not, Your 

Honor. They were not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Strain --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Strain, you -- you 

mentioned --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- in -- in your brief, 

you seem to put considerable stress on something that I 

haven't heard you say one word about so far, and that 

is that these -- workers' compensation is State-

mandated. They're not negotiated or even employer-

determined benefits. They are whatever the law 

prescribes. And you haven't -- haven't mentioned that, 

so I'm wondering where that fits into your picture. 

MR. STRAIN: It -- I haven't mentioned it. 

I'll take this opportunity to mention it, Justice 

Ginsburg, because it is a very important point. 

We know that in the statute -- (a)(4) we're 

talking about -- section (a)(3) -- these are numberings 

before 2005 amendment to the act. The language stayed 

the same. The numbers were -- are different. 

But there are two that work together. The 

(a)(3) priority for wages for the employees and the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does (a)(3) appear? 

There -- there was that discussion in your brief, and 

I'm darned if I could find (a)(3). 

MR. STRAIN: Section (a)(3), Your Honor. 

I'll refer you, if I may, to the brief of amicus at

page 11, and that's why I mentioned, Your Honor, that 

there is a new numbering because the numbering in the 

amicus brief is using the 2005 numbering in the revised 

statute. And what is listed there as (a)(4) is the 

wages priority, and at the next page, (a)(5) is the 

priority that we're talking about as -- as (a)(4). 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it would have been 

nice to have it in your brief --

MR. STRAIN: I agree. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and numbered -- numbered 

3 instead of 4. That would have helped a lot. 

MR. STRAIN: I -- I certainly recognize that, 

Your Honor. 

The -- the provision of (a)(3) and (a)(4) --

they work in tandem to protect the workers. They share 

a cap. The more a worker benefits from a wage 

priority, the less the worker benefits from the -- from 

the employee benefit plan priority. And so they work 

together; they work in tandem, which gives meaning to 

(a)(4) under many of the canons of construction that --

that we're familiar with. 

It would not work -- it's an anomaly that an 

insurance company receivable would share the cap with 

the wages priority. That is simply an anomaly. And 

when we look to the legislative history, it is

absolutely clear, Your Honor, that the fact of the 

judicial -- the statutory mandate for workers' 

compensation insurance is very important because what 

is spoken about, as Judge Niemeyer pointed out in his 

dissent below -- what is spoken about in the 

legislative history over and over again is a wage 

substitute or a wage surrogate that employers do not 

give -- will lower the wages but provide fringe 

benefits. So the package remains the same. Now, 

that's not a workers' compensation insurance policy, 

but that is the wage surrogates that the Congress was 

looking at. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Let -- let me, if I may, ask 

you about other possible wage surrogates because what 

you're saying now seems to me to mesh with the 

argument, another legislative history argument, to the 

effect that the -- the current provision was meant to 

overrule two prior cases of this Court. And the -- the 

question I have turns on the fact that the -- the 

language is broader than what would merely have been 

necessary to overrule those cases. 

So my question is if the broader language 

does not cover the premiums that we're concerned with 

here, what other items dealing with -- with wage 

substitutes would it pick up, would it include?

 MR. STRAIN: Well, Your Honor, I -- I would 

answer from -- in part from the legislative history of 

some of the things discussed were joint apprentices and 

training programs, by way of example, as new forms of 

fringe benefits that some of the witnesses wished to 

see to ensure would be covered. I think that sort of 

thing could be covered under -- under this language as 

well. 

We know from the legislative history -- we 

know from the legislative history that there was 

absolutely no intention to incorporate the definition 

of ERISA, and we know from this Court's teaching in the 

decision in United States v. C&F Fabrication just 10 

years ago that it is absolutely inappropriate to 

incorporate into the bankruptcy statute an ERISA 

definition where Congress does not provide. That's an 

absolute square holding of this Court that exactly 

should lead to rejection of the effort by Zurich to 

incorporate -- to ask the Court to engraft onto this 

statute a -- a definition from another statute. 

If there are no questions at -- additional 

questions at this time, I would like to reserve my 

remaining time.

Strain.

 Mr. Verrilli. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR. 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

I think it's important to focus at the outset 

on exactly what a workers' compensation plan provides. 

A workers' compensation plan provides health insurance 

that pays for the medical costs of a workplace 

accident, disability insurance --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're begging the question 

by calling it a plan. I mean, that -- that's -- that's 

one of the issues here. Why don't you tell us what 

workmen compensation laws require? 

MR. VERRILLI: Well, I'd be happy to go right 

to the question of whether it's a plan, Justice Scalia, 

because I think it's indisputably a plan under this --

under the dictionary definition, ordinary meaning of 

plan, this Court's interpretation of it in Pegram, 

under ERISA, under the Department of Labor's 

interpretation of it, and under plain common sense. A 

plan is an arrangement or program or scheme, as Pegram 

said, to -- established by an employer or an employee 

organization to secure the provision of benefits to an 

employee through insurance or otherwise.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Verrilli, there's no 

employer or employee, for that matter, who's doing the 

planning. The planning is all done by the Government 

MR. VERRILLI: See, I -- I --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- because what's covered 

is prescribed by law. 

MR. VERRILLI: I think there is a plan for 

this reason, Justice Ginsburg. The -- what the law 

prescribes is that which the employer must provide to 

the employees. But it's not a self-executing law. 

The -- the employer has got to make arrangements to 

ensure that the benefits are provided, and under the 

laws of the vast majority of the States, the employer 

has options for doing that. The employer can contract 

with an insurance company to do it. The employer can 

self-insure to do it. And by the way, Justice Kennedy, 

there are quite stringent requirements for fiscal 

solvency and there is a surety bond that needs to be 

posted in order to -- in order to self-insure. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the it is not 

negotiable. We think of a health plan, a retirement 

plan. That doesn't have to be any set coverage. It's 

negotiated or the employer, if it's not a collective 

bargaining situation, determines what the benefits will

be. Here, the law determines what the benefits will 

be. 

MR. VERRILLI: I agree that that aspect of 

the arrangement is not negotiated, but there is 

nonetheless an arrangement that secures and guarantees 

the provisions of the benefits, and that's the plan. 

There are steps that the employer has to take to secure 

the provision of the benefits, here through the 

purchase of insurance, and that is the plan. The plan 

is the arrangement to secure the provision of benefits. 

Certainly they are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if an 

employer decides to -- because his employees have had a 

good year, he's going to put in a new parking lot for 

them -- he -- his plan is to have a contract with a 

paving company to pave the parking lot. Are the 

payments under that contract's contributions to an 

employee benefit plan? 

MR. VERRILLI: I don't think the answer to 

that question is yes, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the 

answer is no. I mean, I suppose you could say that 

those are -- that's a benefit provided to employees, 

but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems like the 

consequence of your theory though --

 MR. VERRILLI: I don't think so. I think 

there's a limiting principle here and I think the 

limiting principle is to look to ERISA. ERISA has a 

set of -- it defines what employee benefits are for 

ERISA purposes, and it's not -- and it's not these 

benefits and similar things. It's an exhaustive list 

of benefits. The parking lot isn't on the list. 

Similarly, a break room wouldn't be on the list. None 

of those things are on the list, and therefore, I think 

by reference to ERISA, one can relatively easily 

exclude those --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but providing 

for workers' compensation through insurance, rather 

than through self-insurance, is also not on the list. 

MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think both of them are 

on the list actually, Mr. Chief Justice, because both 

of those are programs or arrangements to secure the 

provision of benefits, and one is through insurance and 

the other through self-insurance. So I think they're 

plans in both instances. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What's your answer to the 

180 days question I answered -- I asked? You know, 

the provision provides contributions. It doesn't say 

just contributions to an employee benefit plan. It 

says contributions to an employee benefit plan arising

from services rendered, and then it goes on to say, but 

-- but the services have to be within the last 180 

days. 

MR. VERRILLI: Right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you square that with 

-- with the purchase of block insurance like this? 

MR. VERRILLI: Well, because the amounts that 

Zurich is seeking in premiums are the amounts that were 

due for providing coverage during the 180 days before 

Howard ceased operations, and the reason that arises 

from -- it seems to me there are two ways in which that 

could arise from services rendered. It can arise from 

services rendered to the employees in the following 

sense. Howard has the obligation to provide those 

benefits by virtue of the fact that the employees are 

working for it during that period of time. That's what 

Judge King said in his opinion in the Fourth Circuit, 

and that seems to me exactly right. Alternatively --

alternatively, as other courts have suggested, the --

the services rendered --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But each of those insurance 

premiums that's paid by the employer doesn't just cover 

workers who've worked for the last 180 days. Each premium 

is divided among all the workers who've been working 

there for years. Some of the premiums are going to go

to -- to allow the insurance company to pay in the 

future people who have been there for 20 years. 

MR. VERRILLI: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it just seems to me 

it's a square peg in a round hole. I -- I don't see 

how you make sense out of that 180 --

MR. VERRILLI: I appreciate that, Justice 

Scalia, but I do think the -- the obligation on the 

part of the employer to keep paying the premiums 

during that period arises from the fact that the 

employees are continuing to work during that period. 

And what the -- and what the insurance company is 

seeking to recover is merely the cost of providing the 

insurance during that period of 180 days which arises 

JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if they don't pay the 

premium with respect to the 180 days, if there's an 

accident during the 180 days, the insurance doesn't 

cover the accident. 

MR. VERRILLI: That's an important point, 

Justice Souter, and I would like to focus on that and I 

-- I hope correct something that the Petitioners said. 

With respect -- it all depends on when the 

insurance policy cancels. If there's nonpayment of 

premiums, then the insurance company has the right to

cancel the policy, and there has -- there's a notice 

provision, 10 days in some jurisdictions, up to 30 days 

in others. But they have a right to cancel the policy. 

If an injury occurs before cancellation, that 

injury is covered and it's covered for all time, even 

if the policy subsequently cancels. 

But the key thing here, I think, the critical 

point is that without the priority, the -- the 

insurance company is going to look at the situation and 

say, we have very little prospect of recovering if this 

company actually goes down the tubes and into 

bankruptcy as a general unsecured creditor. Therefore, 

we need to get out of this situation fast. And they --

at that point, they're going to cancel the policy. 

There's going to be much more of a hair-trigger sense 

of the need to cancel policies. When they cancel 

policies, the immediate consequence, of course, is that 

the -- that the employees are no longer covered. 

And then, the -- it seems to me, the 

secondary consequence, which is also quite important --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You really think that --

that they cut it that fine? They say, oh, yes, this 

guy is going to go into bankruptcy. We're pretty sure 

about that, but don't worry. We'll have priority.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think as soon as they 

smell bankruptcy, they're going to pull the plug 

anyway. 

MR. VERRILLI: That -- I -- I disagree with 

that, Justice Scalia. I think in -- in the real common 

practice here, the amount that they can recover and the 

amount that they think they have a prospect of 

recovering is a very important determinant in their 

decision on whether to hang in and how long to hang in 

until they get to the chapter 11 process where the 

debtor can then husband its assets and can pay the 

workers' compensation premiums as an administrative 

claim. So I think it's a -- it's a significant 

determinant. 

Without the priority, there's going to be a 

hair trigger, which means coverage is terminated 

sooner, and it's going to mean for many employers that 

they're going to have to go out of business because you 

can't operate without --

JUSTICE BREYER: There -- there are two parts 

in my mind to this. The question is what is the 

difference between a workmen's -- worker compensation 

and health benefits. I agree with you, so far 

tentatively, that that difference can't lie in the 

nature of the contract providing the benefit. Now, I

know they'll want to argue the contrary, but put that 

to the side. 

If it doesn't depend on that, it depends on 

the difference between workers' compensation and health 

benefits. And you want to say there isn't enough of a 

difference there, though they argued the mandate makes 

a difference. Of course, you could mandate health 

benefits too, and I don't think that would matter. 

But if you're right, what about a -- a long-

term contract for bottled water for the workers? 

MR. VERRILLI: I think my answer would be the 

same as to the Chief Justice that in some sense, I 

suppose you could say it's an employee benefit; in some 

sense, I suppose you could say that there's a contract 

to provide it. But I think you can set the outer 

bounds here by reference to the employee benefits that 

ERISA defines as employee benefits. 

But in any event --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, actually -- this is --

to me anyway, this is an important point because at 

some point you have to draw the line between the things 

of a kind that workers might bargain for and things 

not. Now, if that's where we're getting there, the 

history of workers' compensation may cut the other way.

so, Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: Because? What's -- what's 

the principle I'm going to use? 

MR. VERRILLI: Well, first, if I can make a 

prefatory point, that the bottled water example doesn't 

distinguish the Petitioners' position from our 

position. The Petitioners' position is that if it's a 

-- if it's a negotiated-for, bargained-for benefit, 

it's in. So I don't think that's a -- it provides a 

limiting principle. And it seems to me, wherever the 

line is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure, if they 

have a contract, as part of their -- part of their 

contract, they get the bottled water, that's -- that's 

easy to see why that's covered. But the -- the 

question is when it's not. It's just something that 

the employer does in the course of his business that 

has -- that benefits both his business and his workers. 

MR. VERRILLI: Right, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It has to be arising from 

services rendered. I mean, it -- it really has to be 

part of the contract with the employer --

MR. VERRILLI: Well, I -- I don't think 

that's right. For example, in the -- in the case of 

most voluntarily provided health insurance, the vast

majority of employees in this country -- it's not 

bargained for. It's something an employer provides 

unilaterally --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's one feature of 

this that is -- does make it different, at least one, 

and that is this is a benefit to the employer in the 

way that the others are not. The employer -- there's a 

tradeoff in workers' compensation. It's not just I'm 

going to pay benefits when the person is injured, but 

I'm going to get off the hook for the tort liability 

that I might otherwise have. And in the other cases of 

the other benefits, there is no -- no such tradeoff. 

MR. VERRILLI: Well, the fact that there may 

be a benefit to the employer doesn't make it any less 

of an employee benefit. The question is whether there 

is a plan that provides employee benefits, and the 

insurance coverage provided by workers' compensation 

are clearly employee benefits. I also -- and -- and, 

of course, the with -- with respect to that tradeoff, 

that's -- that tradeoff is an employee benefit too, 

Justice Ginsburg, because the -- the employee has no-

fault liability, gets paid promptly rather than have to 

sue and wait years, doesn't lose his or her job as a 

result of the injury or as a result of bringing the 

lawsuit. So I don't think you can make the judgment

that it's not an employee benefit plan on the basis of 

that fact. And of course, voluntarily provided 

benefits also benefit the employer by making it a more 

attractive place to work and -- and --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, 

Mr. Verrilli? 

MR. VERRILLI: -- better morale. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I -- can I ask you --

it goes back to the first point your opponent made. 

What is the purpose of granting the priority? It seems 

to me the purpose of the priority is to increase the 

likelihood that the wage claims will be paid. And if 

you -- if you win, it won't affect it one way or 

another, as you acknowledge in your brief. But it 

seems to me the priority should serve the purpose of 

increasing the likelihood that the benefits would 

actually flow to the employee benefit plan. 

MR. VERRILLI: I think there are four things 

I'd like to say in response to that, Justice Stevens. 

First, there isn't a textual hook for -- for 

that being a determinant, and it -- and it --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it talks about 

contributions to an employee benefit plan which one 

would not normally think of as paying insurance 

premiums.

 MR. VERRILLI: And the second thing -- well, 

I think to the contrary, Justice Stevens. I think in 

the overwhelming majority of instances, the 

contributions employers make to employee benefit plans 

is the payment of insurance premiums to secure the 

benefits. Collectively bargained benefits provided by 

union trusts are a small minority of the benefits that 

are provided to workers in this country. 

But -- but going back to the specific 

question, of course, as Justice Alito's question 

earlier suggested, in a multi-employer pension plan 

situation, the plan is obligated by law to provide all 

vested pension benefits whether or not the employee's 

employer has defaulted on its payments into the fund. 

So it's in exactly the same position as the insurance 

company is with respect to that set of benefits, and 

therefore, the argument doesn't draw a distinction 

between the two. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Verrilli, what -- what 

is your response to Mr. Strain's assertion that if you 

get a priority, so should the secondary insurer, that 

is, the -- the bank that gave letters of credit? 

They're just insuring -- that -- that's part of the 

plan too. They couldn't have gotten the insurance from 

you unless they got the letters of -- of credit from

the bank, which is a kind of secondary insurance. 

And also in the case of self-insurance, which 

is something of a plan -- I -- I guess you'd call it a 

plan -- what about the -- the person who puts up the 

bond? That person is a kind of insurer, just as you 

are. Do all of these people now -- now get bumped up 

to the head of the line? 

MR. VERRILLI: The answer is no. The statute 

expressly covers this. The last provision of section 

507 says no subrogation, and those would be subrogation 

situations. So the statute just expressly covers it. 

They aren't -- they don't get bumped up in the line, 

period. I don't think there's any dispute about that. 

that --

If I could, though, return to a -- a point 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where does that 

appear? 

MR. VERRILLI: I'm sorry. I can't direct you 

to where it is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, because it's not in the 

briefs --

MR. VERRILLI: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- just -- just as the 

contract isn't before us. 

MR. VERRILLI: It should be in the briefs.

It's not, but that is what the last section of section 507 

says, that those who are subrogated to the rights of 

someone with a priority don't get the priority. So 

that's just taken care of by the statute. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But if the payment of the 

premiums doesn't increase the likelihood that the 

employees will get the benefits, why should you get 

priority? 

MR. VERRILLI: It does increase the 

likelihood, and it goes back to the example I was -- I 

was discussing with Justice Souter earlier. And -- and 

what -- it will not affect employees who are injured 

before cancellation, but it will accelerate 

cancellation. And as a result of accelerating 

cancellation, employers who are injured after 

cancellation will not get the benefits. And so it will

MR. VERRILLI: No. I think that -- I think,

JUSTICE SCALIA: So we -- we have your 

assurance that that's what happens here. 

MR. VERRILLI: As a systematic matter -- it

insurance companies will do. I don't think that's 

dependent actually, Justice Scalia, on -- on the 

particular terms of this contract. I'm saying as a 

systematic matter insurance companies --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it has to be that way? 

I could write a contract differently. 

MR. VERRILLI: Well -- well, sure, but the 

contracts comply with State law. State law sets notice 

periods for cancellation, 10 days minimum, up to 30 

days. We've cited those in our briefs. And so in most 

States and in many States here, within as few as 10 

days after nonpayment, you can cancel.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No, it wouldn't be

says we're entitled to priority.

directly with the bankruptcy.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You couldn't have the 

plan without the bond, just as here you wouldn't have a 

plan without the insurance policy. It's just a 

different way of paying for the same thing. 

MR. VERRILLI: Well, I'm -- I think there's 

an order of -- there's another order of degree of 

removal, and it would make it a harder question, I 

suppose, as to whether there would be a -- whether 

there would be a claim for priority in that context. 

But I think, if I could, Mr. Chief Justice, 

I'd like to return to the question of narrow

construction where we started the argument. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I detract you just for 

a moment? On -- on a question of the statutory 

history, correct me if I'm wrong, but originally, 1934, 

the kind of claim that you have would be a seventh 

priority claim. And then in '38, Congress said no 

priority at all covering workers' compensation. And 

then when Congress restored a priority, it ratcheted it 

up to four or five, depending upon which version of the 

statute we use. Is there any explanation why, when 

Congress originally assigned first a very low priority 

and then no priority, suddenly it gets up to be on a 

par with the fringe benefits? 

MR. VERRILLI: Yes. I think there are two 

significant points there, Justice Ginsburg, in terms of 

the history. First, in 1934 what Congress said was 

that workers' compensation could be a provable claim. 

It then said it's -- it gets the -- the seventh 

priority, but the seventh priority was not a priority 

specific to workers' compensation. It was a priority 

that's -- it was a provision that said you get a 

priority if State law provides the priority. In 1938, 

what Congress did was wipe out that provision for all 

State law granted priorities, not for workers' comp in 

specific. So it doesn't seem to me it was a specific

judgment about workers' comp and its place in the 

priority system. 

And, of course, you didn't have the well-

developed system of employee benefit plans in the 

1930's that you have now. And what Congress did, when 

it enacted this provision in 1978, following closely 

after ERISA, was to use language which is identical to 

ERISA in providing a priority for employee benefit 

plans which, as ERISA on its face, I think, makes 

clear, would encompass workers' compensation plans. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Verrilli, your --

your friend's argument about the interrelation between 

(a)(3) and (a)(4) seems like a compelling one. What is 

your answer to that? 

MR. VERRILLI: I think the complete 

explanation for the relationship between (a)(3) and 

(a)(4) was that Congress was trying to expand the scope 

of the priority here without doing damage either to the 

wage priority above it, which -- and -- and there would 

have been damage to the wage priority above it if wages 

were simply redefined to include the broader set of 

employee benefits -- or to the priorities below. 

Congress just took the aggregate amount. It seems to 

me just an elegant solution that protects the wage 

priority above, creates a new priority, and doesn't

disadvantage any of the -- any of the priority-holders 

below. And I really do think that's the complete 

explanation for the relationship between the two. You 

really can't infer anything more than that. 

But if I could just address the so-called 

rule of narrow construction. Certainly there is a 

sentence or two in Nathanson and Embassy Restaurant, 

but those were such clear cases of statutory 

construction that -- that the rule of narrow 

construction, I submit, played no role there. 

In many, many more cases in which this Court 

has interpreted the priority provisions of the act and 

the code, the Court has not mentioned this idea that 

there's a rule of narrow construction or that the 

principle of equality of distribution to creditors 

should trump everything else. We've cited four in our 

brief: Lewis, Shropshire, Ricketts, and SBA v. 

McClellan, which by the way, expressly cut back on 

Nathanson. 

But there are many more cases. There's a 

whole line of tax priority cases culminating in the 

Reorganized CF&I Fabricators decision in which the 

courts adjudicated the question of -- of the scope of 

the tax priority. Most of the time, they find 

priority. Occasionally they find no priority. But in

none of those cases is this so-called rule of 

construction ever mentioned or the supposed primacy of 

the rule of equality of -- of the principle of equality 

of distribution ever mentioned. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, much of your 

case hinges on the assumption that Congress 

incorporated the ERISA definition into the bankruptcy 

code. What -- what is your strongest evidence for 

that? 

MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think the fact that 

the phrase is identical to the phrase that appears in 

ERISA, employee benefit plan, is significant. ERISA 

was one of the most substantial legislative 

accomplishments of that decade of the 1970s. And so I 

think the mere fact that the exact same language 

appears in both places, importantly, however, with --

without the limiting qualification in section 507(a)(4) 

that exists in ERISA itself with respect to workers' 

compensation plans. 

I also think that if the Court does look at 

the legislative history, what -- what one learns from 

the legislative history is that when the bill was 

originally introduced to -- to create this priority, it 

created a priority for -- proposed to create a priority 

for pensions, insurance, and similar employee benefit

plans. The union representatives came in to Congress 

and said that's too narrow. We need something 

significantly broader to ensure that the full range of 

employee benefits is protected and granted this 

priority. What the union representatives all urged 

Congress to do was to adopt the ERISA definition 

wholesale. 

Now, we don't have anything in the -- in the 

House or Senate report saying that's what we did. In 

other words, we intended to adopted ERISA wholesale, 

but we do know that is what, in fact, they did. They 

used exactly the language from ERISA and they moved it 

into the priority in section 507. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: To follow up on the earlier 

question of the Chief Justice, by whom do you 

understand the services have to be rendered within the 

meaning of the act? 

MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think that the -- I 

think that the statute could be read --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Does it refer to the -- the 

bankrupt's employees or your employees? 

MR. VERRILLI: It could be the -- it could be 

either, it seems to me, Justice Stevens. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: You think it could be 

either.

either way. If it's the services rendered of the 

employees, the -- the claim is for contributions to --

for the cost of providing insurance to those employees 

during the 180 days. If it's the services rendered at 

Zurich it's the provision of services during the 180 days --

It's to a lot of other people. I mean, that's --

MR. VERRILLI: But it -- but it arises from. 

The -- had -- I think it arises from in this sense, 

Justice Scalia. Had Howard shut down on a certain day 

and didn't have employees anymore, it wouldn't have any 

continuing obligation to or need to pay workers' 

compensation premiums because there would be no workers 

to cover. And so it arises from --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, except the workers who 

had already been injured in the past --

MR. VERRILLI: Right, but you don't need --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and -- and whom you 

continue to pay. Right? 

MR. VERRILLI: But -- yes. But not -- but --

but we -- let's see. I think that maybe this will 

clear up the confusion. We continue to pay for them 

even after the policy is over --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. VERRILLI: -- and -- but -- and so --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And I assume that each of 

your premiums takes into account the fact that you're 

not only going to be paying for people, you know, who 

were injured between the last premium and now, but that 

you're also going to be paying for people who were 

injured a long time ago. 

MR. VERRILLI: Well, depending on the kind of 

policy, that may be true to some extent. Sometimes 

policies are loss-sensitive policies in which the 

amounts owed are calculated very carefully with respect 

to the amounts actually of loss incurred during the 

period. That is, in fact, the case here. If you have 

an understanding of insurance, you can infer that from 

the charts that are included in the joint appendix, 

although I acknowledge it's very difficult to do so. 

So I do think -- I do think on any common 

sense understanding of the -- of the phrase, arising 

from, which is a capacious phrase, it really does arise 

from. 

But in terms of -- I think, Justice Stevens, 

with respect to your question, to get to the same 

answer, in terms of calculating the amount of the 

claim, whichever one you pick here, there's actually a

division of authority in the lower courts. There's a 

Fourth Circuit opinion by Judge Luttig, saying it's 

services rendered by the insurance company. Other 

courts say services rendered by the employees. Since it 

doesn't make a difference in this case, I would 

respectfully suggest probably it ought not to be 

decided in this case because you get to the same place 

either way. 

I do -- I do think that it's important also 

-- I'm sorry. Excuse me. If I may just go back to the 

narrow construction rule. 

The -- the point of this idea of primacy of 

equality of distribution. Equality of distribution is 

an important policy under the bankruptcy code, but it's 

only one important policy under the bankruptcy code. 

Rehabilitation of the debtor is an important policy 

under the code. The maximizing the value of the estate 

is an important policy under the code, and specific 

code provisions advance other specific policies as 

well. So in any given case, as here, all of those co-

policies aren't going to align and point in the same 

direction. Sometimes they're going to be at cross 

purposes. 

And what -- what the Court said in Union 

Bank, in I think a closely analogous context

interpreting the ordinary course exemption from -- from 

the preference rule, was that we don't put a thumb on 

the scale either way here. We don't assume that one of 

these policies is more important than the other. What 

we assume is that Congress struck the balance between 

the potentially competing policies, that the balance is 

reflected in the text of the statute that Congress 

enacted, and that we should interpret the text as it's 

written without -- without a presumption in either 

direction. I really think Union Bank is highly 

instructive on that, and it's just -- it's just right 

and plain common sense. And that's why I think in the 

vast majority of cases, there is no rule of narrow 

construction. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is -- what is 

unemployment compensation? Those two I think of as 

those are law-mandated coverage that every employer 

must have: workers' comp and unemployment. So 

what's unemployment, is that a plan too? 

MR. VERRILLI: No, because the employer 

doesn't have the obligation to provide unemployment 

compensation. That's a State-run system in which the 

State has the obligation to provide the benefit, and 

the State does in fact provide the benefit. It's 

usually funded through a tax. The key difference is

this is an employer obligation to provide these 

benefits, and I think that's why this is an employee 

benefit plan. The employer is obligated to provide it 

to employees by virtue of the fact that the employees 

are working for the employer. Not true about 

unemployment compensation. 

In conclusion, if I could just focus on the 

-- the point that it really is the case that enforcing 

this priority, as it is written, will advance the 

purposes for which Congress included it in the code. 

It will protect the interests of workers, millions of 

whom have no employee benefit plan other than workers' 

compensation, because it will increase the prospects 

that that money is there to pay workers' compensation 

claims. 

It will also advance the code's purpose of 

better rehabilitation because it will give insurance 

companies a reason not to pull the hair trigger, to 

hang in there with these companies, and to allow them 

to have a chance to rehabilitate rather than forcing them 

into liquidation by canceling coverage which the law 

allows. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

Verrilli.

 Mr. Strain, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL F. STRAIN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. STRAIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

This Court 10 years ago in United States v. 

Reorganized CF&I provided that -- I suggest, that the 

engrafting of the ERISA definition into this bankruptcy 

statute was improper. Almost word for word what we're 

asking the Court to find about this engrafting of the 

ERISA definition into the bankruptcy statute is dealt with 

in plain language in this Supreme Court decision. It is 

simply improper to do that, and yet, that is the answer 

given by Zurich to the many probing hypotheticals about 

parking lots and bottled water and the rest. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, they're doing that to 

get a standard. 

MR. STRAIN: I'm sorry, Your Honor? 

JUSTICE BREYER: And I'd like to know what 

your -- they're trying to use that as a basis for 

separating the bottled water from the workmen's comp 

from the health benefit. And they're saying here's an 

example of where Congress put the workers' comp on the 

same side as the health benefit. Now, that's their 

approach. 

What's your approach to the standard? What

rule or system would you use from deciding which 

insured-for or paid-for benefits count as the plan and 

which ones don't? 

MR. STRAIN: What we look to, Justice Breyer, 

first of all, is whether it is a true wage substitute 

rather than a policy to take care of a non-negotiable 

statutory requirement that's --

JUSTICE BREYER: So if, in fact -- if, in 

fact, the State legislature mandates certain health 

benefits, then the plan that provides those benefits 

would no longer qualify. 

MR. STRAIN: That would be one significant 

factor to consider, Your Honor. There are certainly 

others, but that would be one significant factor to 

consider. That is true. 

And I -- I suggest to the Court that when we 

look to the legislative history, as the questions were 

asked about the legislative history, it is devoid of 

any reference to the commission that recommended the 

law, the House report or the Senate report, or even one 

stray Congressperson suggesting that workers' comp 

insurance policies should get a priority. Not one. 

The industry didn't even put up a representative to 

make that suggestion at a hearing. It is devoid of any 

support for putting this nose under the tent in the way

they suggest, and it truly is a broadening. It is not 

subrogation. The bondholder would not have a 

subrogated claim. F&M Bank would not have a subrogated 

claim. They would have a claim, a direct claim, just 

as Zurich does here. 

And I think that the issue we come back to --

and I'm glad my brothers ended with that as well because 

that's where we began. The issue is what is the 

Court's proper approach to this attempt to enlarge the 

priority under subsection (a)(4). It is not correct 

that this Court departs from the idea that priorities 

are a deviation from the bedrock principle of equality 

of -- equality of distribution. That remains good law, 

cited by this Court a number of times. 

The cases they purportedly cite to the 

contrary were plain language cases, were Embassy 

Restaurant and Joint Industries Board. This Court 

didn't even feel necessary to cite that principle 

because of the -- because of the plain language. Where 

is the plain language establishing clearly, as this 

Court requires, that this is a plan? Where is the 

plain language establishing clearly that this is an 

employee benefit? The insurance policy. That's what 

we're talking about. Not the workers' compensation 

statute. The insurance policy may benefit the

employer. The statute may benefit the employee. But 

we are talking about contributions to an employee 

benefit plan. Zurich's insurance policy is neither. 

Unless there are further questions, Mr. Chief 

Justice, that concludes my argument. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

Strain. 

MR. STRAIN: Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is 

submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:11 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
