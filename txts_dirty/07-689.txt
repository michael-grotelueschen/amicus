 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear argument 

first this morning in Case 07-689, Bartlett v. 

Strickland.

 Mr. Browning.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BROWNING: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 The Voting Rights Act should be interpreted in 

such a way as to encourage a transition to a society 

where race no longer matters. In North Carolina, 

coalition districts have been crucial in moving towards 

Congress's ultimate goal. Coalition districts bring 

races together by fostering political alliances across 

racial lines. As a result they serve to diminish racial 

polarization over time. Coalition districts help us in 

reaching the point where race will no longer matter in 

drawing district lines. These districts bring us one 

step closer to fulfilling our Nation's moral and ethical 

obligation to create an integrated society.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can you say that 

this brings us closer to a situation where race will not 

matter when it expands the number of situations in which

redistricting authorities have to consider race?

 MR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, 

Mr. Chief Justice, it will require somewhat an increase 

in the number of districts that would be drawn, there is 

no question about that, but that increase is not 

substantial. But it does cause race to be much less of 

a factor in the redistricting process.  Currently, if a 

General Assembly has a choice between drawing a 

coalition district or a majority-minority district, the 

50 percent rule that the North Carolina Supreme Court 

adopted encourages States to draw a majority-minority 

district, and when you do that it causes race to re-

dominate in the process.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me to be 

a criticism of the majority-minority district approach 

in the first place.

 MR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, it is a 

recognition of the fact that coalition districts allow 

us to move away from majority-minority districts and 

create districts where races are working together.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about influence 

districts?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you move --

you've moved from majority-minority to crossover

districts. Should you continue to move to so-called 

influence districts?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, the decision in 

LULAC makes clear that influence districts are not 

protected under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But under your definition 

of coalition district, race is the key factor.

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor -

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you are telling us if 

we have a rule that makes race the key factor then race 

doesn't matter.

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, it is a matter of 

-- under the Voting Rights Act, Congress has made clear 

that districts should be drawn to protect minority 

voting rights. When there are areas of the country 

where there is racial polarization, districts -- race 

has to be considered in drawing districts that will give 

minorities equal opportunity, just as majority --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought you were 

proposing a brave new world of coalition districts.

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, and race --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Based on race.

 MR. BROWNING: Justice Kennedy, you have to 

consider race in drawing these districts. There's no 

question about that. That's the very thing that section

2 of the Voting Rights Act requires us to do.  And you 

do that because there is racial polarization.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the authority that 

says you must consider race in drawing the districts, 

assuming that you don't have an existing majority --

minority-majority district? What's the -- what 

authority do you cite for the fact that you must 

consider race in drawing districts? What do I read to 

find that?

 MR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, that's 

certainly the decision in Thornburg v. Gingles. Under 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, that's -- that's a 

majority -- majority district.

 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. That was a 

majority district. This Court --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. So then what other 

case do you have?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, this Court, of 

course, has left open the issue of whether the Voting 

Rights Act would protect minority --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then your statement 

that you must always consider race in drawing districts 

is not -- is not supported, or at least it's a new 

proposition that you are arguing for us here.

MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, my point is when 

you are drawing districts under section 2, of course 

race has to be considered, but it's considered because 

the process is not equally open to minorities. 

Unfortunately, North Carolina has a long history of 

discrimination, and that discrimination has resulted in 

current effects in the voting place. There is racially 

polarized voting, as has been stipulated to in this 

case. There has been --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I would have 

thought the possibility of coalition districts would be 

evidence that the Voting Rights Act has succeeded, 

rather than evidence that you need to apply it more 

broadly.

 MR. BROWNING: Mr. Chief Justice, the 

coalition districts are certainly evidence that we have 

made progress towards Congress's ultimate goal under the 

Voting Rights Act, but we are not there yet. In this 

district, the expert testimony is that only 15 to 30 

percent of whites will vote for a black candidate, and 

that is still very racially polarized. But coalition 

districts help us to move away. It -- they help to 

diminish the amount of racial polarization over time, so 

that eventually we won't need to be looking at race at 

all in drawing district lines, but where --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I mean, the 

obvious question when you say 15 to 30 percent is what 

number of crossover voters would you say demonstrates 

that you no longer need to consider race in shifting a 

coalition district?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, in the Gingles 

case, this Court stated that it was a district-by-

district determination. There's no bright-line rule as 

to where crossover voting is so great that it doesn't 

satisfy the third Gingles prong. Here, however, the 

district was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, it could 

be 70 percent that don't vote for a particular 

candidate. At some point you have to conclude that it's 

based on the candidate rather than on race.

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, at some point 

that's true, that it would be issues beyond race, but 

here, the expert report and as stipulated to by 

Respondents, this voting is racially polarized. There 

is some crossover voting, but not enough to say that the 

effects of past discrimination have been eliminated. 

That crossover voting is sufficient for this district to 

work.

 JUSTICE ALITO: You can't say where -- how 

much crossover voting would be so large as to make a

difference? You can't say where the line is 

statistically?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, this Court's, 

again, decision in Gingles makes clear that that is a 

district-by-district determination.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that -- that has been 

stipulated here, right, that you meet the third Gingles 

factor? So it's not at issue in this case, but the 

point was made that, in one of the cases that you rely 

on, in Metts, that reliance on crossovers to prove the 

ability to elect the candidate of a racial minority's 

choosing undercuts the argument that the majority votes 

as a bloc against the minority preferred candidates. So 

there's tension between the crossovers on the one hand 

and showing that the dominant race votes as a bloc.

 MR. BROWNING: Justice Ginsburg, I 

completely agree that, at some point, the crossover 

voting becomes so great that you no longer have to take 

into account district lines. Unfortunately --

JUSTICE ALITO: If that's the case, then --

MR. BROWNING: -- we're not there yet.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If that's the case, then 

your test imposes a statistical standard just as your 

opponent's test does, doesn't it? It's just a different 

one.

MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor. What we're 

proposing and what we think is required by the text of 

section 2 is you simply take the existing Gingles 

factors and you look at the amount of racially polarized 

voting, and from that you are able to readily calculate 

the size of the minority group that would be 

sufficiently large to elect a minority -- a minority 

candidate.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose there is 40 percent 

crossover voting, and that's a little bit -- that's not 

quite enough for the minority candidate to win.

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, again, whether 

the third Gingles prong is satisfied obviously is a 

district-by-district determination. Here, however --

JUSTICE ALITO: We can't even say that 40 

percent would be sufficient in every instance, that that 

might be -- you know, that might not be enough?

 MR. BROWNING: I'm hesitant since this Court 

has not set a specific limit, and that's, again, an 

issue that has been stipulated to in this case. The --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you don't suggest 

that if there were 40 percent white crossover voting, we 

would find white bloc voting within the Gingles 

condition, do you? Do you think that is a serious 

possibility?

MR. BROWNING: No, I think it would be very,

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I mean you really 

do have an answer to Justice Alito's question.

 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the answer? 

What percentage of crossover voting would make this not 

actionable under section 2?

 MR. BROWNING: Again, the third prong is not 

an aspect of this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you don't have an 

answer to Justice Alito's question?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. BROWNING: If you are saying that 40 

percent is a very high amount of crossover voting, that, 

of course, is not our case, where the crossover voting 

that is necessary to make this coalition district work 

is 18 percent crossover voting.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have racially 

polarized voting when you have as high a crossover vote 

as 40 percent? I mean, you say, we apply the normal 

Gingles factors, but it seems to me 40 percent crossover 

is fairly high.

 MR. BROWNING: 40 percent is a high number, 

and particularly --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you still think that we 

can confidently say this is racially polarized?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, here, however, 

under this case, there's not 40 percent crossover --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're opening 

yourself to this line of questioning about the third 

factor, which is conceded by both sides, so it's not in 

issue. But you are opening it by having a test that 

looks to the second and third factor and leaves the 

first factor out of it. I mean, whether you agree with 

it or not, the 50 percent line is bright if you know 

what's in and what's out. You don't have any test for 

the first factor that's comparable, that would give 

district courts and attorneys some degree of security 

about how you determine the first factor.

 MR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, as the 

language the Court used in the De Grandy decision is 

whether the minority group is sufficiently large to 

elect a minority-preferred candidate. There are, of 

course, limiting factors on the side of the coalition 

district which could be drawn. There are practical 

limiting factors and there are legal limitations.

 The practical limitation, of course, is in 

North Carolina, given what has happened in past 

elections, the North Carolina General Assembly

appropriately concluded that a minority group of less 

than 40 percent would simply not work, that it would not 

be effective to give rise to a minority -- a district in 

which minorities elect a minority-preferred candidate.

 There's also a legal limitation. In the 

Court's decision in LULAC, the Court made clear that 

influence districts are not protected by section 2. So 

as a result, the minority group will by necessity have 

to control its coalition partner; otherwise it would 

simply be an influence district. And here at a minority 

group of 40 percent, the minority group in the area is 

substantially larger than the crossover voting that is 

needed to have an ability to elect.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under your theory, 

it would be possible to challenge a majority-minority 

district on the ground that you could draw a different 

coalition district, maybe more than one coalition 

district. Let's put it that way.

 If you could draw a majority-minority 

district and you could draw two crossover districts, 

does the Voting Rights Act impose a limit on the choice?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, our position is 

that the -- assuming all of the factors under Gingles to 

be met, that if you have a minority group that was 

packed in to a -- one district, and in its place two

coalition districts could be effectively drawn, and 

those districts would actually work and you could meet 

all of the other standards under Gingles -- the district 

was geographically compact, there is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an easy -- I 

suspect that's a common hypothetical. You could draw a 

district with 80 percent minority voters or you could 

have, as you have here, two 40 percent districts. And 

the Voting Rights Act requires what?

 MR. BROWNING: In that situation, assuming 

you could meet all of the Gingles factors, that, yes, 

that 80 percent district should be drawn as two 40 

percent districts.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Aren't you adopting the 

principle of maximization?

 MR. BROWNING: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you this, and 

correct me if I am wrong, because it has been a long 

time since Gingles came along and I may be forgetting 

things. But I -- I thought when you are given the 

alternatives you were just giving, one 80 percent and 

two 40 percents, that because there is not a principle 

of maximization there simply is not an abstract or 

bright-line answer to the question; and that in order to 

get an answer to the question, you look at all of the

other things that districting authorities look to, and 

you see how they add up, whether we are talking about 

compactness, congruency with -- with -- with other 

political lines, and so on. And unless you look to all 

the other things that reasonably can and should be take 

into consideration when districting is done, you simply 

cannot answer the question, should there be two 40's or 

one 80.

 Am I wrong?

 MR. BROWNING: Well, Justice Souter, 

certainly the -- the criteria that you have referred to 

have to be part of the districting process.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But they weren't part of 

your answer to the Chief Justice.

 MR. BROWNING: Well, my point is that when 

minorities are basically put in an enclave, in a 

separate district but yet it is possible to draw two 

districts, two coalition districts, and the other prongs 

of Gingles have not been met, so that there is not rough 

proportionality throughout the State, yes, the 

districting body needs to consider drawing two 

districts --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It needs to consider it, 

but I thought your answer was it needs to do it. Is 

that your answer?

MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor, it would 

be -- it is our answer that if a district -- if there is 

not rough proportionality in a State, there is a 

district that is a super-majority and there is no reason 

for that super-majority to be in place.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay if there is no reason 

for the super-majority. My point is that you cannot 

answer the question in the abstract. And when you start 

to answer it, as you are doing now, you are going beyond 

the abstract and you are getting into facts outside the 

mere choice between two 40's and one 80. And that seems 

to me to be correct. At least, if it's not correct, you 

and I are making the same mistake.

 MR. BROWNING: No, Justice Souter, your 

point is well taken and I agree that with a hypothetical 

like that it's very difficult, unless you are actually 

considering the specific situation of the district.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we -- what you 

propose is going to inject courts into the drawing of 

districts much more frequently than they -- than they 

already are injected. The reality is that one of the 

factors -- you mentioned contiguousness and county lines 

and so forth, but one of the factors that legislators 

always take into account is incumbent protection and the 

incumbent is always going to rather be in an 80 percent

district than in a so-called 40 percent coalition 

district.

 I think you are unrealistic to expect State 

legislatures to draw districts that way, where everybody 

will have a chance. The whole object of it is that 

nobody will have a chance, just the incumbents. That's 

what is going on.

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, I think what 

Congress has required courts to do is to look at the 

overall picture of the district. The Congress, in 

connection with the section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 

used very broad language, phrases like "totality of 

circumstances" and "opportunity to participate and 

elect." So clearly, Congress intended for a broad 

approach to be taken and a functional one.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's fine, but you 

just can't wave a magic wand. It -- Congress also 

intended primarily to leave it up to the legislatures 

under guidelines, to be sure. And when you have a 

choice of one 80 percent or two or even three 40 

percent, it's clear to me what the legislature is going 

to -- going to choose.

 MR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, and that's 

the very point of the section 2 of the Voting Rights 

Act, is when minorities do not have equal opportunity to

elect their candidate of choice, where they are packed 

in to districts --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We will be injected into 

this very political game much more frequently than we 

now are. I have always regarded the 50 percent Gingles 

thing as simply a self-protection prescription for the 

courts, where you can look, you can be clear and say, 

you know, close enough for government work.

 But if you want us to figure out whether 

there could be three districts, two districts instead of 

just one district, you are just, it seems to me, tossing 

the whole -- the whole project of drawing districts into 

the courts. And that is -- that is not something that 

I, for one, favor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: In this case which way 

does the presumption favoring what the legislature did 

cut? Here the court set aside what the legislature did; 

is that not right?

 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor, the North 

Carolina Supreme Court determined that this district 

should not cut county lines. Ironically, that county 

line was a county line that was originally created to 

segregate blacks in Wilmington, in the southern portion 

of the county, from whites in the northern portion of 

the county.

So that original discriminatory act is now 

being used to keep a district from -- from being a place 

that is a district that has a proven ability to elect a 

minority --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's something new. I 

thought we took the case -- at least I have been 

thinking about the case -- on the assumption that there 

is a valid State law that is being superseded. Now, if 

you are questioning the validity of the State law, 

that's something -- that hasn't been raised here, has 

it?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, the government 

has asserted that there should be a near-50 percent test 

which includes as part of it a -- either the district is 

close to 50 percent or there is an element of 

discrimination.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking about, you're 

indicating to us that the county line standard that the 

State court invoked as a matter of State law is itself 

questionable because it was based on a prohibited racial 

animus. And I -- I indicated that that's very new to 

me. I thought we were taking the case on the 

proposition that the county line rule is a neutral, 

valid State law principle.

 Now, it may or may not be superseded by

the -- by the requirement of section 2. That's what we 

are arguing about. But this is the first time I have 

heard that we have to somehow question the underlying 

State rule under the Fourteenth Amendment.

 I thought we took the case on the assumption 

that the State rule is valid.

 MR. BROWNING: Justice Kennedy, the decision 

of the North Carolina Supreme Court is to adopt an 

inflexible 50 percent rule. That -- that was the issue 

that was resolved on summary judgment by the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking about the 

county line rule.

 MR. BROWNING: Yes, Your Honor, that the 

county line rule -- the North Carolina Supreme Court 

concluded that this district could not cut county lines 

because this should not be treated as a section 

2 district.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We are fighting 

over -- the district that you want to draw, the 

crossover district, would have 39 percent 

African-American voters. The district that complied 

with State law of the county line would have 35 percent.

 Where the assumption is that you have a 

significant degree of crossover voting, is that really a 

difference worth changing the Voting Rights Act

jurisprudence for?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, the plaintiffs 

have and the Respondent and the government have referred 

to an alternative district that would not cut those 

county lines and would have a black voting age 

population of 35 percent. The problem with that is 

there is absolutely no testimony that that -- their 

alternative district would be in any way workable. As a 

matter of fact, the undisputed testimony of the joint 

appendix at page 73-74 is to the contrary.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you mean by 

"workable"?

 MR. BROWNING: That this -- that the 

district they propose was simply prepared by their 

attorney, looking at a map. There is absolutely no 

testimony that this would be an effective minority 

district, that there would be an equal opportunity for 

minorities --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because it's 4 

percent less than the district you propose?

 MR. BROWNING: Well, it is a matter of the 

percentage of voting age population, but more 

importantly, the district they drew would have put a 

black incumbent, a black Democrat incumbent, in the same 

district with a white Republican incumbent. If they

were serious about --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it gets back to 

the Justice Scalia's point --

MR. BROWNING: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that this is 

designed to protect incumbents.

 MR. BROWNING: Well, Your Honor, incumbency 

certainly has to be considered in the context of what 

the Voting Rights Act requires us to do, which is to 

look at the total picture. Is it a functional approach? 

It is a matter of looking -- undertaking a searching 

evaluation of the past and present political realities.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Browning, I thought 

there was something in the record that said never in 

North Carolina's history have you had African Americans 

able to choose the -- able to elect the candidate of 

their choice where the minority population was less than 

38.37 percent.

 MR. BROWNING: Justice Ginsburg, there are 

districts such as Wake County, the seat of government, 

where a minority has been elected with less than 38 

percent. But in areas of the State where there is 

highly racially polarized voting, 38 percent roughly is 

the effective floor that the General Assembly recognized 

as being workable for creating a district such as this.

I will also note that this issue was not presented to 

the North Carolina Supreme Court, the issue of whether 

there is an alternative district that would somehow be 

feasible and workable.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, does that mean a 

proposal if you succeed, we should remand on that 

question?

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, that would 

certainly be one possibility, but the North Carolina 

Supreme Court resolved this straight legal question as 

to whether the 50 percent rule is in place and is an --

is an inflexible rule, and not only did they -- they 

imposed this rule with respect to this district, they 

essentially had a mandatory injunction on the North 

Carolina General Assembly to never draw a district at 

less than 50 percent if it cuts too many county lines; 

and that is even inconsistent with the United States' 

view of section 2. For that reason, alone the decision 

should be reversed.

 If there are no other questions I would like 

to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

Browning.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. THURMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court.

 The rule proposed by Petitioners in this 

case would effectively require maximization resulting 

in, as the Court has recognized, judicial involvement in 

many, many more situations.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know why it would 

require maximization. It would -- it would certainly 

open the door to -- to more districts required by 

section 2 than if we have a 50 percent rule. But I -- I 

think your brother conceded that when -- when you draw a 

district, you are bound by our case law as well as 

tradition to look to something more than maximization, 

and maximization is in fact not the law. So I don't see 

why it would be required.

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor, in this situation, 

we take the position that the people of North Carolina 

and their ultimate authority, their State Constitution, 

have spoken and said that county lines should be kept 

whole to the extent practical. And the State's position 

is the legislators disregarded that and, based on the 

cases, based on LULAC, at 25 percent --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What's that got to do with 

maximization?

MR. THURMAN: Well, Your Honor, that would 

be the position they would take of every district that 

could be drawn regardless of the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: There is no question that 

if they are -- if they win this case, I think there is 

no question there will be more claims requiring -- or 

potentially more claims requiring adjustment of lines 

based on avoiding section 2 violation. I would almost 

think that was common ground. But that is a different 

thing from saying that the result of those claims is 

going to be a required maximization. And that's --

that's the only point that I -- that I meant to pick --

pick up on.

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor, it seems that if 

there are going to be more potential claims, and as 

every legislative body, school board, city council, 

whatever it is, has to follow section 2, they will have 

to take this into account. They will be facing 

potential claims and they will have to run the risk of 

do we look to try to maximize a district that might not 

otherwise be required, that might violate a neutral 

criteria --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You are saying they will 

tend to maximization in order to avoid litigation.

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor, I think that is

absolutely true.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why in the -- why in 

the world would you stipulate to bloc voting in a 

situation where you have nearly 20 percent crossover 

voting?

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor, the answer to that 

question is we were 20 months into the litigation, we 

had just received a partial ruling on cross motions for 

summary judgment, we were already at the midpoint of the 

decade. If this Court should affirm the North Carolina 

Supreme Court, my client will have one election in which 

they have a district that complies with the North 

Carolina Constitution. We quite simply wanted to move 

the case along.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it seems 

to me you have complicated situations on a rather 

critical point, what seems to me a basic conundrum, how 

can you have bloc voting and at the same time have 

significant crossover voting? You take one of those off 

the table, it's kind of hard to address the basic issue 

in the case.

 MR. THURMAN: I agree, Your Honor. The 

other point that I would point out is, it is not a 

stipulation that there was sufficient bloc voting within

either of the districts that were drawn. The 

stipulation was with reference to bloc voting within the 

two counties. The district that could be drawn -- there 

is no stipulation that the alternative district does not 

comply and would -- and therefore would require the 

creation of the 39 percent district.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, since the district is 

drawn from the counties and there's a stipulation with 

respect to the counties, doesn't it follow in the 

absence of some surprising fact that there would be bloc 

voting or the stipulation would cover bloc voting in the 

district?

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor, there are very 

different populations in these two counties, and that is 

referenced in the record with regards to the growth in 

population; and there is very different minority 

populations in the two counties because of the influx --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But regardless, regardless 

of the -- the variations in mix, if you are stipulating 

that there's bloc voting in county A, bloc voting in 

county B, and you have got a district made up part of A, 

part of B, doesn't it follow in -- in the absence of 

some pretty specific evidence to the contrary, that in 

the district there is probably going to be bloc voting?

respectfully submit that it does not follow within a 

particular section of a district. I think we all --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you have evidence in the 

record -- did you put evidence in the record that this 

particular district is carved from some peculiar section 

of county A and county B, so that the general bloc 

voting pattern does not apply in the district?

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor, there is evidence 

in the record, and it is cited in the brief, that 

minority candidates, black candidates for judicial 

office and for State auditor received between 59 percent 

and 62 percent of the vote in the proposed district. We 

would respectfully submit that that comprises evidence 

that there is not sufficient bloc voting.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you stipulated. You 

didn't want to argue the third factor. You wanted --

you just started out by saying you were tired of this 

litigation, we wanted to concentrate on one issue and 

one issue only, and that was the 50 percent rule. And 

now you are suggesting that, well, no, the stipulation 

really didn't stipulate away the third factor. I 

thought you were giving in on that issue so that you 

could get the first issue decided.

stipulation that there was evidence sufficient to 

support a finding and that we would stand by. There was 

evidence they had an expert who was willing to so 

testify. I was responding to Justice Souter's question 

of was there was evidence in the record to support the 

contention that there might not be bloc voting within 

the alternative district, and that was -- that meant 

that black candidates can receive in excess of 60 

percent of the vote in the 35 percent district.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But just help me on the 

facts, because I may have misunderstood the facts. 

You're saying you did not stipulate that there was bloc 

voting; you stipulated that there was sufficient 

evidence for a factfinder to find that there was bloc 

voting. Is that your position?

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor, on page 130a of 

the -- I believe this is their submission, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry, what -- what's 

the color of the brief -- of the cover on this? Is it 

the brown one or the white one?

 MR. THURMAN: I believe this is the white 

one, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. THURMAN: And it starts out that, in 

terms of the bloc voting, between the -- and the 

evidence presented by the defendant is sufficient to 

support a finding of fact that the racial difference in 

the presence of those results in the white majority 

voting is sufficient as a bloc to defeat the minority's 

preferred candidate. And, again, that comes down to --

the court that it was Pender and New Hanover County that 

started the action on 29a, and that was the stipulation. 

And --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But what do you make of the 

-- the beginning of the next paragraph? "Plaintiffs 

hereby advise the court that they do not wish to be 

heard further or to present evidence regarding the 

remaining issues." Doesn't -- I'm not sure what that's 

getting at, but when I looked at it, I thought it meant 

that the stipulation can control, i.e., it may be found 

without objection that there is bloc voting or assumed 

without objection that there is bloc voting.

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If you don't wish to 

present evidence.

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor, first of all, we 

were not stipulating that it did exist. We stipulated

that it was in evidence, that the court defined --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, I realize, but when 

you then say "And we don't wish to present any evidence 

on it," it sounds to me as though you are conceding the 

issue.

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor, we do -- we let it 

stand on its own, we not wish to be heard further, we do 

not wish to take additional time on that, given the 

circumstances of the case.

 The other factor that I think is perhaps 

most important in considering this is touched on briefly 

earlier. Section 2 clearly applies to all 

jurisdictions. And without the guidance of the 50 

percent rule, the bodies that are drafting are left with 

an uncertain standard and a standard -- in this case, so 

far as we know, the State had retroactive -- this Court 

-- had been used previously, are every local government 

body requires paying such an expert to proceed simply to 

redistrict? That, if you don't have a clear rule to 

follow, presents a problem for the many government 

bodies that have to redistrict on a regular basis.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was wrong with the 

clear rule that Justice Souter suggested in the LULAC 

case?

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Souter, in his 

opinion in the LULAC case --

MR. THURMAN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- he suggested what he 

called a hard-edged -- a clear, hard-edged rule which is 

not going to be an exclusive rule, but, anyway, if you 

met that standard, you're okay.

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor, I certainly am not 

criticizing the rule proposed by Justice Souter, but --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It's okay.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor, I think -- the 

perspective -- and I can't help -- that it is not as 

clear-edged as it seemed to the Court, at least to 

Justice Souter, that the 50 percent rule does provide a 

very clear, very limited sort of a rule that can be 

followed without getting involved in -- I do believe 

that -- race becomes very likely the predominant factor 

in the redistricting decision, because based on the 

cases that have come before you already, there have been 

claims that 26 percent, 25 percent --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see how those 

claims could possibly succeed, but I thought -- let's go 

back to sort of step 1. My mind turns a little confused 

when I start thinking of these cases. Are we talking

about a case of -- where the claim is normally vote 

dilution? Is that yes or no?

 MR. THURMAN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Section 2 -- does vote 

dilution mean we who are a minority group, let's say a 

black group, could have elected a candidate of our 

choice more likely than the white group, but because you 

are engaged in vote dilution, that isn't going to happen 

anymore? Is that the form of the claim?

 MR. THURMAN: Yes, Your Honor, that is --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's the form of the 

claim.

 Then, it's our problem here that to see 

whether that's so, you have to see whether the black 

group did really vote as a group. Did they used to have 

a good chance to elect the person they want, and does 

the white group tend to also vote as a group and swamp 

them? Is that what we are trying to find out?

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor, I'm not sure that 

is entirely what we are trying to find out, because 

certainly districts are created where there was no 

minority incumbent, and that can happen because of 

changes in demographics or a variety --

JUSTICE BREYER: There are a lot of reasons 

that can happen. But is the evil we are trying to get

at, the evil of a black group, when they stick together 

in polarized voting, having less of a chance of getting 

their candidate elected than when the white group does 

the same?

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor, I believe the 

answer is, yes, we are trying to prevent that from 

happening.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what we are trying 

to prevent? Okay. If that's what we are trying to 

prevent, then haven't we learned that putting a 

threshold, because you can't even get in the door -- you 

can't even get in the door -- unless the black group 

accounted for 50 percent of something, the voters or the 

people who turn out, that that doesn't make much sense 

for the reason that Justice Scalia started with. It 

doesn't make much sense because sometimes they account 

for 51 percent, but they can't elect anybody, because 

they all divide on four different people, or maybe they 

didn't turn out. On the other hand, sometimes if they 

account for 43 percent, they could elect the candidate 

of their choice. So it looks as if that 50 percent is 

pretty arbitrary and we're looking for a better 

criterion. Is there anything wrong with what I've said 

so far?

believe there is, because you said you look to see if 

there is vote dilution. Well, there needs to be 

something to measure that by. Section 5 is about 

retrogression.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Here what we've -- could we 

look to see whether the three Gingles factors, whatever 

they are -- one was, is the black group numerous enough 

to elect the candidates of their choice? Reasonably 

compact, politically cohesive? And then you look to 

see, does the white group tend to vote as a bloc to stop 

them?

 MR. THURMAN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what we should do?

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then I'm back to my 

problem, that sometimes the 50 percent criteria just 

doesn't measure that first part. And so you say, well, 

any other matter would be worse, but I bet we could 

invent some that were actually better. Suppose you 

wouldn't have to go to 20 percent; suppose, for example, 

you started looking in the 40 percents, and you said, 

you know, if the black group is going to elect their 

candidate with 40 percent, or 45 percent even, they're 

going to need a lot of crossovers, because they may only 

vote -- you know, only 80 percent may turn out. They

are going to need a lot of crossovers. And the more 

crossovers you have to have, the harder it is to say 

that that white group is out there trying to beat them.

 So there's a kind of natural stopping place. 

When I worked out the numbers, it seemed that natural 

stopping place fell around 42-43 percent. It sort of 

fell -- as you said, that the black group -- you insist 

that the black group had to be twice as many as the 

white group that crossed over. A little arbitrary, but 

at least we were getting to the same -- to the right 

thing. I mean -- respond as you wish.

 MR. THURMAN: Thank you, Your Honor. It may 

take me a second to take it all in. It seems to me that 

the reason the 50 percent rule does work is, at 50 

percent, there is a claim that there is the opportunity 

and there is voter registration, voter turnout, a lot of 

factors that can influence at that point, but that 

doesn't prevent there from being opportunity. That's 

the choice of whatever group is involved. You start 

dropping below 50 percent, and then they're not being 

denied an equal opportunity. They have the same 

opportunity any other group does. This would require 

trying to -- because what -- basically the Petitioner's 

position is -- the State in its -- position is, it takes 

a minority group, and then you find presumably another

majority group that shares political and partisan goals 

with them, and you combine those two together. So you 

look not only to the race of one group -- that 

predominates first. Then you go find like-minded 

members of the majority group to join with them. And so 

that is what is being required. At that point you are 

not talking about them being treated less equal than 

anyone else.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Thurman, can I ask you 

this question? It seems to me that a rigid 51 percent 

rule assumes that the minority communities throughout 

the country are all alike, and that there is enough 

variety in every district and every part of the country 

where we have this problem. There are variations. 

Maybe 51 percent would not be enough. The minority 

group might, itself, be divided as is often the case.

 I -- I think the underlying premise -- the 

underlying -- the premise underlying your argument is 

that all minorities are exactly alike. That's why we 

can have this mathematical figure, and that answers the 

question.

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor, I categorically 

reject that as a human-rights basis for our argument. 

That is handled by the third Gingles prong and the 

second Gingles prong. And when you look at what the

coalition is, what it is, and you look at how 

politically cohesive it is. So it could be that 50 

percent is arguably not enough under the second Gingles 

provision.

 But that until you get to 50 percent, you 

are -- again, it is the way it has been described as a 

gate-keeping function for us to keep the Court out of 

it. And it is going to -- if this happens, you start 

looking at combining a combination of race or other 

minority status and partisan politics and combining them 

together for the purpose of electing particular 

candidates. And I do not believe it's ever been 

something that this Court has endorsed for the purpose 

of the Voting Rights Act. And if that is the position 

it takes, it starts to run into the issue: Is such 

supportable under the Solomon case, under equal 

protection?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what 

Justice Breyer proposed a rule at the end of his 

question. He said: Suppose you make it, the threshold, 

instead of 50 percent, it would be twice as many in the 

African-American population as in the crossover group. 

That would be the threshold.

 MR. THURMAN: But, Your Honor, first, I 

believe as he said, as Justice Breyer said, that's an

arbitrary number that he picked up on, the 50 percent. 

The reason we would submit that is not simply an 

arbitrary number is that it does deal with them. At 

that point there is an opportunity, regardless of 

whether there is the -- what it certainly does not 

exist --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but you are saying 

it's an opportunity, and what you mean is it is 

sufficient to provide an opportunity. And 

Justice Breyer's question is: Isn't the two-to-one 

ratio something that we should consider as also being 

sufficient to provide an opportunity?

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor, I would say that 

that would not be appropriate, because at that point you 

are looking on -- at the basis of race to give one group 

a greater opportunity than another, and the Voting 

Rights Act is the one group being given less opportunity 

than another. And so if you are hinting to draw a 

district that bases itself on race, that attempts to 

give one group --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's -- it's a 

greater opportunity than -- than would be given to them 

in -- in the district or a pair of districts that splits 

the minority population in half. But how is it in some 

abstract sense a greater opportunity?

MR. THURMAN: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The opportunities are --

are measured on the ground, not in the abstract.

 MR. THURMAN: Your Honor, my answer to that 

would be that the -- what would be proposed is it is 

required. It is no longer left up to the legislature to 

decide whether that is appropriate. And that since it 

is a requirement, that is not part of the political 

process; and it goes to whether that is -- they are no

are, in fact, given more.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. JOSEFFER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Petitioner has proposed expansion of section 

2's traditional coverage because of three serious 

problems. The first is to provide State and local 

legislatures, as well as the courts, with a baseline 

against which to when a section 2 District must be drawn 

in the first place, when to engage in this race-

conscious exercise in the first place.

 Second, it raises the serious Constitutional 

concerns identified in LULAC, especially because it 

combines not only racial gerrymandering but with 

political-party gerrymandering all at the same time.

 And third, it requires difficult predictive 

judgments about how people would react, how people would 

vote in a future proposed district, something that is 

not required under the traditional Gingles analysis.

 And these problems would exist nationwide 

because section 2 applies to every districting done in 

every jurisdiction and every -- nationwide, be it a 

county, city, or locality or down to the school-board or 

city-council level.

 Now, under the first of those points, under 

the traditional Gingles test, the scope of consideration 

of race and other things, as well as the majority limit 

of the districts -- and that provides an -- an easy 

focal point that anyone drawing a district knows.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you were 

conceding that it isn't a rigid rule, and that the North 

Carolina Supreme Court should have to be -- I mean they 

could be 48 percent, I think you said.

 MR. JOSEFFER: We have identified two 

narrow exceptions, neither of which the Court really

needs to reach in this case. The first is an inference 

of intentional discrimination. And the important thing 

there is, first, that's academic. Because if you can 

prove intentional discrimination, you can proceed with a 

constitutional claim under section 2 and not add 

anything anyway.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Intentional by those who 

draw the district?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Yes, exactly. And there --

the point here is because it's not an actualization 

statute, one needs a baseline to determine if there is 

the denial of an equal opportunity to elect. And if, in 

fact, what the people drawing the district were trying 

to do was to deprive the minority group of that 

opportunity, that is a perfectly good alternative 

baseline.

 Our other proposed narrow exception, which 

also is not even close to being implicated here, is 

basically an evidentiary one: That there are those 

cases where, when you are trying to figure out whether 

the majority population is above 50 percent, you may not 

be sure because these are estimates. They are very 

reliable, but we would impose about a two percent 

cushion there to adjust -- to account for the 

possibility that if there is that much evidentiary

uncertainty, it makes sense to have a -- for purposes of 

that test. However --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know if you 

litigate whether you are -- whether you are really 

talking about a -- a possible two percent variation. So 

that I mean, I -- I think you have to concede under your 

-- under your test that there's going to be more 

litigation. There is going to be more claims than there 

are under a 50 percent rule.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, because -- I say 

actually the opposite because -- well, I think that 

trying to determine 48percent raises no more difficulty 

than trying to determine 50 percent.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Except that you have a 

better chance so you are more likely to do it.

 MR. JOSEFFER: There is -- there is a slight 

narrowing of the -- of the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Two percent is pretty big 

in an election.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, in -- in practice -- I 

mean, remember, the majority-minority rule has been 

followed in almost every jurisdiction nationwide for 

more than two decades, and so far I have seen one 48 

percent case. There may have been others, but there --

there don't seem to have been very many.

JUSTICE BREYER: If you want an absolute, 

arbitrary rule, which is what you were heading toward 

which will just -- - the question is whether they get in 

the door. If they are in the door, they have to prove 

the three factors. And you want to keep certain people 

out.

 Okay. Suppose you say, well, 42 percent. 

That gives you down to 40, with your two back, instead 

of 50. But you are out anyway if the crossover vote 

from the white majority is more than half of what the 

whole vote is with the black and white together on that 

side. So you have a two-to-one ratio.

 Now, the only virtue of that is that there 

was an effort to try to get an arbitrary rule, which you 

have with your 50 percent, even -- only a little bit 

more difficult than that to -- to administer, and is 

likely to get in more cases that are justified. But 

they still have to prove their three factors.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, there -- there are a 

couple of things. The first is that, textually 

speaking, what the statute refers to is an equal 

opportunity to elect the -- the representative of their 

choice. And at least the most principal blind is the 

majority-minority rule. Because if you have by 

yourselves the majority of the electorate, you have at

least in theory the opportunity to elect the 

representative of your choice. When you go beyond that, 

there really is at that point --

JUSTICE BREYER: It takes into account the 

realistic fact that in every group, including lots of 

African-American groups, there is -- it is not 

100 percent African American at all. There are -- there 

are a few others who will come along, and -- and that's 

still the candidate of that community's choice.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Right. But that's --

JUSTICE BREYER: So we want -- a little 

flexibility here is all that I'm suggesting.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Yes. The problem is once you 

go below what is at least in principle a 50 percent 

line, it's not clear where -- where one would ever stop. 

And under your approach, I think two exceptions: One, 

you definitely open the door down to potentially below 

42, especially -- in this case, especially --

JUSTICE BREYER: You can't get below 42. 

I'm not going to get below 40 no matter what, even with 

your thumb on the scale.

 MR. JOSEFFER: I mean --

JUSTICE BREYER: They are -- they are 

finished at 40, and they are not even in at 40, if they 

have to depend more than two-to-one on the crossovers.

MR. JOSEFFER: One problem with what you are 

looking for is a principle rule that can be justified. 

I understand 50, and I understand the slight evidentiary 

cushion. Forty-two really does -- from what you're 

trying to determine is now the equal opportunity to be 

coming out of nowhere.

 The other advantage the 50 percent rule has 

is the advantages of incumbency. In effect, it has been 

a case that has been litigated for more than two 

decades. And that has shown that, first, that it's 

workable; and second, that it does not appear to have 

left some gaping hole of section 2's coverage. If it 

had, Congress likely would have -- statute over the past 

two decades.

 And the other thing -- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I won -- I'd hoped that 

you could have a brief time to discuss your third 

rationale because it's going to require determination of 

how people would vote.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Under Gingles one typically 

looks at what actually happened in the past. The third 

Gingles factor looks, for example, looks to whether 

white bloc voting in actual elections has generally been 

sufficient to prevent the election of minority group's 

candidate of choice in the past. So, it's a

straightforward historic-based inquiry.

 Here, however, the state or local 

legislature at the outset looking to trade a new 

district based on the prediction that it will elect the 

minority group's candidate of choice.

 So, as a practical matter, you start with 

the racial makeup of some people and the political 

partisanship of others. But you can't stop there, 

because you have to predict turnout by each group, 

crossover voting by each group.

 As a practical matter, those things will 

vary based on who the candidates are, whether there is 

an incumbent, whether the incumbent is the minority 

group's candidate of choice. And especially in local 

elections, the -- may not even be available, which was a 

point that was made in the topside amicus brief filed by 

the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, the NAACP Legal 

Defense Fund and others.

 If I could turn to the Constitutional --

point. In that perspective, this proposal is really the 

worst of all worlds, because the way you construct a 

district is to take some people based on race, others 

based on political party affiliation, and the race can't 

dominate and the majority of courts have also held 

purely partisan gerrymandering, at least -- aside is

also unconstitutional.

 But this is both. What you have is 

nationwide in every jurisdiction, every districting a 

mandate that requires consideration for both race and 

partisanship that goes far beyond what has traditionally 

been required under section 2 and I suspected far beyond 

what normally happens at the local level.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have a view 

on how we should approach the stipulation adopted below?

 MR. JOSEFFER: I think the easy way to cut 

through is that a state Supreme Court respond and remand 

all arguments other than the first Gingles factor. So, 

the first Gingles factor, based on what happened in the 

state Supreme Court is the only thing that is before the 

Court.

 What would remain potentially unremand is if 

this Court were to would ban the traditional 

understanding of the first Gingles factor and impose a 

new understanding. Then the adjudication of that might 

be open on remand. But Respondents have remanded 

everything else in the state Supreme Court.

 Finally, I also can't help but mention that 

there is a great irony here in that Petitioners' 

essential position is that back when race relations were 

worse and back when there's much more racial bloc

voting, minority-majority districts worked okay.

 But now that race relations have improved 

and there is much more crossover voting, we should now 

require greater consideration of race as well as 

partisanship than had ever been done before under the 

same unamended statute.

 And if I could turn -- Justice's -- at the 

outset, a state or local legislature as well as the 

court really doesn't know where to start. State and 

local legislatures are the ones who are supposed to be 

drawing these lines. That means they need to be clear 

administrable rules to follow. And the simpler they 

are, the better the chance we will have to do it, and if 

they can figure it out at the outset, the less 

consideration of race and partisanship becomes 

necessary.

 And the 50 percent rule, as a practical 

matter, has worked for a couple of decades in this 

respect. And if one goes beyond that, there is also no 

principle stopping point. Here's 39 percent, which 

doesn't seem close to me or under Justice Breyer's 

rationale --

worked. Did you see the graphs -- one of Amicus briefs

one gerrymander and how the lesser percentage worked 

out -- remember which were much more -- not using the 50 

percent rule produced much more compact districts?

 MR. JOSEFFER: There are two things about 

the graphs. The first is that less compact maps --

those were the districts that would determine the 

unconstitutional.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But they were designed to 

produce 50 percent, and that's why they got so -- so --

so grotesque.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Right. Another thing there 

seems to be a common misconception that our view of 

section 2 prohibits the drafting of crossover districts, 

which is not case of all.

 The question here is what if it is required. 

If a district -- if a jurisdiction wants to draw a 

crossover district, then at least in principle nothing 

is stopping it from doing so. However, if what you were 

to do was require the drawing these crossover districts, 

that could create some funny maps of its own, because if 

you have to reach out to grab jurisdiction wide, look at 

every significant pocket of minority voters, look at 

whatever you could put together that would vote alike, 

which as a practical matter is the same political party, 

then you are going to be requiring the same dynamics

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BROWNING: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 Let me start first of all with 

Justice Breyer's question about the arbitrary nature of 

the 50 percent rule. The 50 percent rule, let there be 

no doubt, is extremely arbitrary, even under the 

government's 2 percent cushion.

 What would happen is you have a district 

that is 40 percent -- 46 percent African American, that 

district could be freely carved off into two districts 

of 23 percent each, neither of which would provide an 

equal opportunity to elect. Even when you are in a 

situation like this case, where the district is actually 

functioning and has a proven ability to elect a minority 

preferred candidate. Moreover --

JUSTICE ALITO: Wouldn't Justice Breyer's 40 

percent rule be just as arbitrary?

 MR. BROWNING: Justice Alito, it is

important to recognize that there are significant 

districts that are out there that would not be protected 

under the 50 percent rule. And I understand the Court's 

desire to have some sort of limitation on the size of 

the district. We believe it is already in there, in 

place as a result of the LULAC decision.

 It's in place because in North Carolina, as 

a practical matter, you can't go much below 40 percent 

and have a district that will actually work.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this -- but yours is 

below? Just slightly below.

 MR. BROWNING: The voting age population is 

39.36 percent based upon the census data. The 

government wants to use a 2 percent cushion as their 

threshold. But there is some significant problems with 

that, because when you look at the overcount of white 

voters, the Census Bureau recognizes the lower count is 

basically 2 percent there in and of itself, then there 

are some undercounted black voters is a 1 percent 

undercount. So even a 48 percent doesn't even get 

anywhere close.

 Moreover, you have districts where there are 

a number of eligible -- number of people that are 

counted in the census that are not truly eligible to 

vote. That is reflected in the brief by the States at

page 28 in footnote 2. The States make the point that 

there are many districts where we have military bases, 

we have colleges that cause this to be an extremely 

arbitrary rule.

 And in North Carolina there are districts 

where once you remove the military base where most of 

the population will not be voting in that district, 

there is a shift of even 12 percent in the minority 

voting age population increasing by 12 percent once you 

just remove the military bases from the equation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The rule I suggested, 

though there are arbitrary aspects is a better targeted, 

more administrable -- or equally administrable or not 

much worse administrable arbitrary rule.

 MR. BROWNING: Justice Breyer, in our view 

the rule that should be applied is consistent with the 

rule of LULAC, that the minority group is substantially 

larger than its coalition partner.

 Here the minority group is 39.36 percent 

African American. It only requires an additional 

roughly 11 percent white crossover voting. So the white 

crossover voting that is needed is only a third of the 

size of the minority group.

 JUSTICE BREYER: There must be somebody 

there to get you over 50 percent.

MR. BROWNING: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Thirty-three plus 11 is 44.

 MR. BROWNING: Your Honor, this district is 

39.36 percent African American.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's 40, and then -- oh, 

I see, 39 plus 11.

 MR. BROWNING: And you need 11 percent

 There is some crossover voting, but not 

enough to make the -- for us to lose on the third 

Gingles prong.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
