 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Our last argument of 

the term is in Case 10-568, Nevada Commission on Ethics 

v. Carrigan.

 Mr. Elwood.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ELWOOD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Neutral laws requiring official recusal for 

conflict of interest do not abridge free speech because 

a legislator's vote, however expressive, is not 

protected speech. It is, rather, a legally binding 

exercise of State power that he wields as an incident of 

public office.

 The Nevada Supreme Court concluded that 

Respondent did have a free speech right to vote, and 

that overrode the Nevada recusal statute. For four 

reasons, that holding was error.

 First, since the earliest days of the 

Republic recusal rules have been understood to serve 

important interests unrelated to any views a legislator 

may want to express, by requiring disqualification when 

circumstances indicate that private interests may have

affected his independence of judgment.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the -- the case 

is -- is presented to us with briefs that seem to pass 

in the night. Your emphasis was on whether or not there 

was a right to vote that's protected under the First 

Amendment, and -- which is what the Nevada court held 

and you're quite correct to address it. But the 

Respondent says: Well, this interest has a chilling 

effect on -- on protected speech. I think we have to 

reach both parts of that argument.

 Do you -- DO you agree with me?

 MR. ELWOOD: I think that the Court could 

simply address what the Nevada Supreme Court did and 

tell it whether it got it right or got it wrong, whether 

there's a speech interest, and what -- whether that is 

subject to strict scrutiny or not.

 But I think that, even though that argument 

I don't think was raised or passed on below, that the 

Court would have discretion to address that. I think it 

would give additional guidance to the Nevada Supreme 

Court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if we -- if we say 

that intermediate scrutiny is the test, even under that 

test, certainly under that test, the regulation cannot 

chill speech any more than necessary to fulfill the

governmental interests, even under the intermediate 

standard.

 MR. ELWOOD: I -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and it just seems 

to me it's difficult for it to just address the standard 

of proof without deciding the case. Maybe you're right. 

Maybe we can just answer the -- the question that was 

certified and -- and send it back, if -- if you prevail. 

I'm not sure.

 MR. ELWOOD: I think -- I think you're 

right, Justice Kennedy, that it would provide more 

guidance to the Nevada Supreme Court. It would be a 

pretty narrow reversal and remand, assuming that the 

Court merely reached the speech question.

 But on the associational question, I think 

it's important to emphasize from the outset that I think 

this would have a negligible effect on association, 

because it simply would not apply all that frequently. 

In order for the recusal statute to apply, two 

circumstances have to be simultaneously met. First, 

there has to be a qualifying relationship which is close 

and ongoing, and simultaneously it must have the -- it 

must -- the third party must have a private, usually 

pecuniary, interest before that same legislator.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: As I understand the

objection, it's not to the recusal rules in general, but 

it's to the vagueness of this particular one. As I 

understand it, there's no concern about the specific 

categories that were mentioned, like family member or 

employer.

 MR. ELWOOD: That is correct, Justice -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So we're dealing not with 

can you have recusal rules. Everybody believes, yes, 

you can. It's the degree of specificity.

 MR. ELWOOD: Well, that was the basis of the 

holding of the Nevada Supreme Court, was that those 

implicated speech rights and that all of them would be 

subject to strict scrutiny. So from the outset, we may 

all be agreed that the court below applied fundamentally 

too high a level of scrutiny.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the -- the objection 

to the statute on the grounds that it's vague doesn't go 

away simply because intermediate scrutiny applies, does 

it, assuming intermediate scrutiny?

 MR. ELWOOD: No, but I think that the -- our 

response to the vagueness argument is that Respondent 

concedes that the four categories for members of your 

households, relatives, employers, and business 

relationships are clear. He says that on page 2 of his 

brief. So the question is whether the "substantially

similar" language gums up the works, essentially.

 Now, "substantially similar" is a statutory 

phrase that has had to have been used by every State 

legislature in the country and by Congress.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not in this context. 

And you don't disagree that -- I forgot which brief told 

us that there's no State has a similar catch-all.

 MR. ELWOOD: Well, first, I would disagree 

with the characterization of it as a catch-all, because 

it only sweeps in relationships that are substantially 

similar. But Seattle, for example, has a, what is a 

true catch-all, which sweeps in -- it applies "whenever 

it could appear to a reasonable person having knowledge 

of the relevant circumstances that the covered 

individual's judgment is impaired because of either a 

personal or business relationship not covered under 

subsection A or B above," which lists the covered 

relationships, "or a transaction or activity engaged in 

by the covered individual."

 So while Nevada may be the only statute that 

applies "substantially similar" to these four 

categories, it is not alone in that structure. And I 

think more importantly, it is not anywhere close to 

alone in its breadth. The New Jersey statute is I 

think, if anything, broader: "A direct or indirect

financial or personal involvement." There are numerous 

State statutes which apply to business associates.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I found this statute 

very difficult to understand, but maybe you can explain 

what's -- what I found a bit puzzling. The statute 

talks about a commitment in a private capacity to the 

interests of others.

 Now, I take it that that commitment doesn't 

have to be something contractual. When you're talking 

about relatives, that would assume -- that that would 

include emotional commitments to the relatives who are 

listed; is that correct?

 MR. ELWOOD: I think it would include the 

things -- the same things that are covered by 

ordinary -- every other recusal statute, which is very 

close personal relationships and relationships that give 

rise to a financial interest on the -- for the public 

official. And we're not talking about, you know -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Not -- not a financial 

interest of the public official, a financial interest of 

the -- the relative or the person who is substantially 

similar to a relative. Or is that wrong?

 MR. ELWOOD: Well, I think that in the case 

of the relative, yes, it's the financial interest of the 

relative, and that's why the very close personal

relationship. But all of the other relationships for 

members of the household, who are presumably part of the 

same economic unit, and for employers, in whom the 

officer has obviously a very close financial interest 

and they're tied together, and for business 

relationships, all of those are to get at the financial 

interests of the officer, not of the third party.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Maybe if I give you an 

example it will be clearer. Let's take somebody who is 

within the third degree of consanguinity. So that would 

include second cousins?

 MR. ELWOOD: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. Now, let's say a 

public officer is considering something that would 

affect everybody's property taxes in town or a measure 

that would affect the benefits or the wages of everybody 

who works for the town. And this official has a second 

cousin whose property taxes would be affected or works 

for the town, and the second cousin's wages or benefits 

would be affected. Now, would that person have to 

recuse?

 MR. ELWOOD: I think that the -- it would 

depend on a couple of things. First of all, it is a 

covered relationship, the second cousin would be a 

covered relationship. And -- and I think the interest

there I think would be the subject of some debate 

whether it is a private interest because it is a broadly 

shared interest. But I suppose because his property 

taxes might increase, it would be a private interest.

 There is still the question of whether a 

reasonable person under those circumstances would view 

his -- his judgment, his independence of judgment, as 

being materially affected.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if I were a public 

officer I would find it very difficult to figure out 

whether a reasonable person would think that an effect 

on my second cousin's property taxes would require -­

would materially affect my judgment. But it's even 

worse than that because of the "substantially similar." 

So the public officer not only has to think about second 

cousins; the person has to think about everybody who is 

like a second cousin to him or her. I have no idea how 

you -- how you go about that.

 MR. ELWOOD: Well, the way that that has 

been defined, and this appears -- this is not just a 

Nevada Commission on Ethics interpretation. This is 

what the legislature understood it to mean, if you look 

at the legislative history, when they added the statute 

in 1999. What they were looking for by adding the 

"substantially similar" relationships were relationships

that were substantially similar to household and 

substantially similar to family. And what is at issue 

there is not the fact that you have a genetic similarity 

makes you more likely to see things their way, but that 

families are presumed to be among your closest 

relationships.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that you spent 

your life in the civil rights movement or the right to 

bear arms movement or one or the other sides of the 

abortion debate, and these are your acquaintances, this 

is your -- it's been one of your principal activities, 

not for pay, but just because of your civic commitment. 

And then you are elected to the legislature and under 

this Nevada statute that controls, must you recuse 

whenever an officer of that association has -- is paid?

 MR. ELWOOD: No, Your Honor. Because, to 

begin with, a personal relationship, it only covers the 

very closest personal relationships. So your most 

intimate and closest relationships on earth would be 

covered.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They have coffee together 

every morning and they're in the same book club.

 MR. ELWOOD: And even that, Justice Kennedy, 

applies with extraordinary rareness. The last case that 

I'm aware of where personal interests alone justified

recusal was in 1999 before the statute was amended.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Elwood, for me at least 

we've -- we've jumped way ahead. I'm not so much 

concerned about the vagueness as I am about the 

proposition that ethical rules adopted by legislatures 

for voting are subject to review by this Court or by any 

court under the First Amendment. This is the first case 

I'm aware of that we've ever had which makes such an 

allegation or -- I'm not even aware of any other case in 

220 years in Federal courts.

 And it's certainly not because legislative 

rules have not been vague. The first Congress adopted a 

rule that, quote, "No member shall vote on any question 

in the event of which he is immediately and particularly 

interested." I don't consider that very precise. And 

the rules adopted by Thomas Jefferson for the Senate, 

"Where the private interests of a member are concerned 

in a bill or question, he is to withdraw." "The private 

interests," what does that mean? "And where such an 

interest has appeared, his voice is disallowed, even 

after a division."

 Now, that's been around in our Congress 

forever, but our Constitution provides that -- that the 

rules of the legislature are to be determined by 

Congress and not by this Court, and I am sure we would

not, we would not review those rules. Now, is there a 

contradiction between leaving those rules to Congress 

and the First Amendment? Do you really think that -­

that the two are set in opposition to each other?

 MR. ELWOOD: Certainly, Justice Scalia, I 

would not think so. And this is the first case that I'm 

aware of, it's the first time anyone has said it to my 

knowledge. I don't even know of law review articles 

that said it before basically the decision that is under 

review for neutral laws of general applicability.

 But to return to Justice Kennedy's question, 

what this law -­

JUSTICE BREYER: You agree with Justice 

Scalia?

 MR. ELWOOD: I agree emphatically with 

Justice Scalia, except that I could never put it as well 

as he did.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're ending up 

skirmishing on what seems to me a less significant 

aspect of this case. This case is enormously important 

on that major question. I'm not inclined to resolve it 

on the question, well, you know, this is too vague. 

mean, it's even vaguer than what the first Congress 

adopted. It seems to me that just opens, opens the door 

to future litigation challenging ethical rules, which -­

which does not make me happy.

 MR. ELWOOD: It is true. And in addition to 

that, to expand it even more, apply it even more 

broadly, with the exception of essentially the D.C. 

Circuit's opinion in Clarke v. United States, this is 

the first opinion I'm aware of where anyone has even 

held that there is a First Amendment interest in any 

sort of expressive official act.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You modified your 

answer to Justice Scalia by saying you're not aware of 

any case that applied the First Amendment to rules of 

general -- neutral rules of general applicability, I 

think. But if the First Amendment doesn't apply, that 

doesn't matter, does it? You can't limit your -- the 

type of rules that you say are not -- are okay and are 

not if the First Amendment doesn't apply at all?

 MR. ELWOOD: I'm not sure I understand your 

question, Justice, but I think -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if the First 

Amendment doesn't apply to this type of activity, then 

you would have no First Amendment objection to biased 

rules of specific applicability.

 MR. ELWOOD: Oh, absolutely we would, 

because I think R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul speech that 

is subject to prescription can't be regulated in a

viewpoint-based manner.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 

position was that this wasn't speech protected by the 

First Amendment.

 MR. ELWOOD: But even speech that is not 

protected by the First Amendment, such as fighting words 

in R.A.V., can't be regulated in a viewpoint-based 

manner.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So someone can 

challenge one of these rules on the grounds that it's 

not neutral, that it applies in a disproportionate way 

to particular members of the legislature?

 MR. ELWOOD: I think they could challenge it 

in a way -- alleging that it was viewpoint-based if it 

were only applied to Democrats or Republicans. But I 

don't think that if it were an otherwise normally 

applicable rule that it would be subject to challenge on 

that basis. That is the relevance of neutrality.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm not sure why you should 

concede even that, Mr. Elwood. If this is just conduct, 

if this is not proscribable speech of the kind that 

R.A.V. was talking about, why should we care about the 

viewpoint based doctrine that's arisen in First 

Amendment law?

 MR. ELWOOD: Well, in the event, Justice

Kagan, that is how I interpret R.A.V., that it would not 

be an available option to have a viewpoint-based recusal 

statute that affected things differently depending on 

viewpoint.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that 

the rules in the House of Representatives allocating 

time on the floor or committee membership are neutral? 

They're biased in favor of whichever party happens to be 

in the majority.

 MR. ELWOOD: They are -- I think that 

they're -- I think that they're neutrally applicable. 

don't know that they would -- I am not aware of them 

applying different amounts of time to majority and 

minority members. I may be incorrect about that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and if they did we 

would review it.

 MR. ELWOOD: I think that any time you're 

talking about -- I mean, depending on what the house is, 

there's an extra measure of deference when you're 

applying, obviously, to the houses of Congress.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that nice. But the 

cases come up here anyway, right?

 MR. ELWOOD: They certainly do come.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Look, fighting words are 

words. They are speech. There's no doubt that they're

speech. And it's a considerable question whether the 

vote of a legislature is speech for purposes of the 

first -- is speech at all, not whether it's a fighting 

speech or something else, whether it's speech. It's a 

vote.

 MR. ELWOOD: But in any event, all the Court 

even needs to get to is whether laws of neutral 

applicability would be covered, because that's all this 

statute is.

 JUSTICE ALITO: This statute doesn't apply 

just to voting. It says that the public officer shall 

not vote upon or advocate the passage or failure of the 

message.

 MR. ELWOOD: But that is essentially -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Advocating the passage or 

failure of the message is surely speech in the ordinary 

understanding of the concept.

 MR. ELWOOD: But that is to essentially 

complete the disqualification just as under Thomas 

Jefferson's recusal rule. When you were disqualified 

under Jefferson's rule, you were out of it. You 

couldn't essentially function as a legislator, and 

that's all that attempts to do. It hasn't been applied 

to Mr. Carrigan.

outside advocacy? It just applies to advocacy within 

the limits -­

MR. ELWOOD: Absolutely. It does not apply 

to advocacy as a citizen outside the legislature.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But even if you have a law 

which is not directed to speech and is directed at 

conduct which is not speech, that law is still -­

correct me if I'm wrong -- even under intermediate 

scrutiny, subject to invalidation if it has a chilling 

effect on -- on speech as an incidental matter, if that 

chilling effect is more than is necessary to accomplish 

the purpose of the statute. Isn't that correct?

 MR. ELWOOD: I -- if it is reviewed -- I 

mean, it depends on the test you use. We don't think 

that O'Brien, which is a test that some of the amici 

have proposed, is an appropriate standard, because even 

O'Brien is talking about laws that have a much greater 

effect on expression because, after all, burning a draft 

card, one of the main reasons you would want to do that 

is an expressive reason.

 Whereas these really are laws that have 

nothing to do with what views people think you are going 

to be expressing. And we think that a closer analogy 

are cases like Burdick, where there are laws of neutral 

applicability that States use to regulate their

have a severe burden on association, have been subject 

to review for reasonableness under Burdick and Timmons,

a much more appropriate analogy for this case.

Scalia's question, the import of it; or don't you?

voting is not speech, then no matter how outrageous the 

law or rule, it doesn't fall within the First Amendment;

not?

 So which is it?

 MR. ELWOOD: Justice Breyer, I don't think 

we have to get as far as the position that Justice Kagan 

was suggesting, that I think Justice Scalia is 

suggesting, because we're willing to abide by R.A.V. and 

require neutrality in the regulations of this. I think

we are here to defend is a neutral law on the part of 

the State of Nevada.

 JUSTICE ALITO: In several recent cases the 

Court has taken pains to make the point that it is not 

going to recognize any new categories of unprotected 

speech. But the argument that you seem to be endorsing 

now in response to some questions is that there is this 

new category of unprotected speech, which is advocacy of 

the passage of legislation when a recusal statute comes 

into play.

 MR. ELWOOD: But I think that if there's any 

law that has a better claim to -- to be added to that 

category, it's one that would be consistent with a law 

or a rule that was adopted by the first Congress 7 days 

after they first achieved a quorum. I mean, those were 

the people who were the people who proposed and framed 

the First Amendment, and they never indicated that they 

thought any sort of personal First Amendment right was 

implicated by recusal rules, either by them or Thomas 

Jefferson's rule, which was not even a rule adopted by 

the whole House.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, just to clarify 

this issue, because I don't know that I've heard you 

state it explicitly, the second part of this recusal 

statute that bars the advocacy of a measure in which

there's an interest prohibited by the statute, it is 

your position that's advocacy in the legislative body?

 MR. ELWOOD: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's only limited to 

getting up on the floor and talking about that?

 MR. ELWOOD: That is absolutely correct. We 

view it as basically completing the disqualification and 

saying you are just not, you cannot act as a legislature 

in deciding whether this bill will be passed.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That person can still go 

outside and give all the press releases they want?

 MR. ELWOOD: Absolutely, they can.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What do we do with cases 

like Miller v. Town of Hull and Colson v. Grohman that 

have recognized retaliation claims because of speeches 

given during the casting of a vote? Would those cases 

still be viable if we decide that there is no First 

Amendment right in voting?

 MR. ELWOOD: I -- I think they would be 

viable under the -- the way we are framing it, which is 

that basically if it's a law of general applicability 

that you could still bring a claim of retaliation, 

which -- those kind of claims are problematic for other 

reasons because there's a lot of what would be called 

retaliation that is itself protected by the First

Amendment.

 But if you're talking about a official who 

is a civil service employee, assuming you need to even 

get there because they have their own civil service 

rights to be there, they would still have the claim that 

it was based on viewpoint-based discrimination, and 

under the rule we are proposing -- or the rule that we 

are willing to abide by, certainly -- R.A.V. v. City of 

St. Paul would protect those people for a retaliation 

claim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Carrigan -- if -- if we 

did not review any of these ethical rules applicable to 

a legislature, at least where the rule is adopted by the 

legislative body itself, as -- as opposed to being 

imposed upon it by -- by some other body, there is the 

protection that all of the legislators are subject to 

it. So if it's vague for Mr. Carrigan in this case, 

it's vague for everybody else as well.

 MR. ELWOOD: That is true, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And so it's sort of a 

self-regulating mechanism. You -­

MR. ELWOOD: That's true.

 MR. ELWOOD: That is true, and this law 

applied -- for the better part of 30 years, it applied 

to every legislator in the State of Nevada. In July of 

2009 the State Supreme Court struck it down as applied 

to members of the legislature. But this was the rule 

they lived under and they didn't think it was ambiguous, 

they didn't think that it chilled their associational 

rights. They seemed to think it was just -- that it was 

just fine.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose you would 

have a First Amendment claim under your theory if the 

generally applicable rule was applied in a 

discriminatory manner; it turned out, you go back and 

look and over the last 2 years the only people who have 

been sanctioned for violating the ethics rules have been 

members of the minority party.

one of those -­

enforcement claims are whole 'nother ball of wax. And I

about, you know, presumptive regularity and that people

 I don't know that that would be a First 

Amendment claim, but perhaps a equal protection claim. 

But it's certainly not presented here. There's never 

been any allegation that these laws have been enforced 

discriminatorily. In fact, arising from the same vote, 

the Nevada Commission on Ethics sanctioned an opponent 

of the Lazy 8 Casino because he had an undisclosed 

interest in -- business interest in the Nugget, which 

was a political opponent of this.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA E. ROSENKRANZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The core problem with this statute which the 

Court has been grappling with is this: an elect -- an 

unelected commission has arrogated to itself essentially 

the right to invalidate an election result and to do it 

in a way that treats core political association as

corrupting. If the police of political purity are going 

to tell an elected official that he cannot cast the vote 

that he ran on and was elected to cast, they have to do 

it clearly, they have to do it prospectively, and they 

have to do it for an important reason.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the 

legislature adopts a rule that says from now on we're 

going to require a four-fifths majority for a bill to 

pass, that lowers the effectiveness of the speech of 

someone in the minority, and you can challenge that on 

First Amendment grounds?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I think not, Your Honor, 

because that is a way of organizing the institution that 

applies equally to all members of the institution.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So does this.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, this will -- this 

will single out individuals at any particular moment in 

time who are specifically isolated and told that 

that particular individual cannot vote.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is that different 

from the minority people in the Chief Justice's? It 

only affects them when they're in the minority?

somebody if they fall within the strictures of the 

statute?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And my -- my point is 

simply that this takes one particular legislator and 

says, you cannot vote. And those rules are completely 

fine in certain circumstances, but not when the effect 

is to tell someone that the rationale, the reason that 

you are being isolated is because you associated with 

someone politically who helped you win an election.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rosenkranz, you are 

not -- is it right that you are not challenging any part 

of this statute except the one that -- that says 

"substantially similar"? The rest you have no 

constitutional objection to; is that right?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That is correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. And more precisely, we are challenging the 

use of that "substantially similar" provision to expand 

the statute to -- to relationships that bear no relation 

to the actual text of the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Rosenkranz, is -- is 

the vote of a judge in a case like the vote of a 

legislator? Is -- is that speech? Because judges are 

subject to ethical rules which -- which prohibit their 

participating if there would be, quote, "an appearance 

of impropriety." If there's anything vaguer than that I

 (Laughter.)

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Here's -- here's what you 

can get out of, Your Honor. You can get out of -- for 

example, if you are, in addition to being a judge, a law 

professor at a State university and that university 

fires you because of an opinion that you issued, that 

opinion is speech. That vote has speech aspects to it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you answering my 

question? I want to know whether I can get out of this 

appearance of impropriety stuff.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The answer is no.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: For two reasons. One is 

that judges are just plain different from legislators. 

Judges are supposed to bring no political loyalties at 

all to them when they are sitting on the bench. 

Legislators are actually not only allowed to, but 

expected, to bring political loyalties when they -­

with whether the First Amendment applies, with all of

bit more by way of chill of a judge's vote precisely 

because judges are supposed to act judicial and purge 

their vote of all extraneous effects.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's too bad, because I 

would have been much more attracted to your position.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I understand, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: And -- and Mr. Rosenkranz, 

what about officials in the Executive Branch? When the 

Secretary of Defense gives a speech and the President 

doesn't like it and the President fires the Secretary of 

Defense, does the Secretary of Defense have a First 

Amendment action?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The Secretary of Defense 

has a First Amendment argument. It would be a very weak 

one under -- under this Court's opinion in Garcetti. 

But his First Amendment rights are implicated if it's a 

speech that he's giving not in the line of his duty.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: So all the official acts in 

the legislature, in the Executive Branch, you're somehow 

saying courts are different, so I guess we don't have to 

worry about that, but official acts across the 

government are now subject to First Amendment analysis?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Absolutely not, Your Honor,

and that was this Court's holding in Garcetti. And the 

reason this Court held that in Garcetti was that there 

the government is acting as employer. The government is 

entitled to discipline its own employees like any other 

employer can. But we all agree government as employer, 

that Pickering standard, doesn't really work in the 

context of regulation of political activity.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What about the rules of 

civility in the houses of Congress? There are things 

that a member of the Senate, for example, cannot say 

about another Senator, or make a personal attack. That 

would be protected by the First Amendment if the Senator 

stepped outside the door. Are those -- is there First 

Amendment protection for that? Do they have -- do those 

rules have to pass First Amendment scrutiny?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Within the chamber, Your 

Honor, no, if it's just the chamber that's sanctioning 

someone. And the reason is those are Roberts Rules of 

Order that apply to everyone and that -- that 

order the -- the debate. But I -­

have to recuse themselves as a result.

outside of the legislature. This is a rule that takes 

political associations and treats them as corrupting, 

core political associations, volunteering of the sort -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, do you think that if 

there were a statute -- let's take out the vagueness 

aspect of this. If there were a statute that said you 

can't vote on anything where you have yourself some 

monetary gain attached to it or if a very close family 

member or if a close business associate or campaign 

manager of your campaign, do you think that would be 

unconstitutional?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: It would not be vague, Your 

Honor. But it would be unconstitutional, unless the 

State demonstrates why a campaign manager is corrupting.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Because the -- the State -­

what the State thinks is that a campaign manager is just 

like a business partner.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And -- and the answer to 

that is no. A volunteer campaign manager is not just 

like a business partner. There is no pecuniary gain to 

the -- to the candidate or the legislator as there is in 

a relationship with a business partner. There's

personal political loyalty. That's what the Ethics 

Commission said was wrong -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- no -- there's no -- I 

thought this -- the -- the only reason that we have this 

case is that the three-time campaign manager was -- did 

have a financial stake in this vote because the project 

was approved.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, that's not 

why we're here. That's not why the commission said we 

are here in the first instance. The commission is now 

saying we're here because of that, but what the 

commission said was it's the closeness of this 

relationship, without regard to the financial gain, 

which the commission accepted was zero for this 

particular lobbyist. Regardless of the financial gain, 

it was the political loyalty. This guy helped you win. 

Because he helped you win, you will be beholden to him 

and do him more favors.

 Well, lots of political activists help a 

candidate win. But on that -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it -- it seems to me 

that if you're going to make this argument -- and this

two ways to do it. Number one, say this infringes the

can say that this impinges unduly on necessary rights of 

association that preceded your election to the 

legislative post.

 It seems to me that the latter is the only 

way that you can make your case and to avoid the force 

of the argument that the Petitioner makes.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it is certainly 

correct that the latter is far narrower. This is an 

outlier statute. No other legislature has ever adopted 

a statute that says campaign manager or political 

loyalty is corrupting. And so this Court could very 

easily say, look, this is just different from all of the 

other recusal statutes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't seem to be 

different from the ones that Mr. Elwood read to us. 

think he read probably one from New Jersey and -­

MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, he -- he cited 

one case from New Jersey. The statute does not refer to 

political loyalty. And in that case it was a close 

friendship, and in the course of describing the close 

friendship the court, after listing multiple factors, 

said one of them was that they were both part of the 

same political club. They also vacationed together. 

That's a completely different application.

know from the briefs, there's no case cited where any 

commission has said this relationship between a 

volunteer and a candidate is itself so corrupting that 

we have to disqualify the candidate from casting the 

vote, the vote that he ran on, that the voters elected 

him to cast.

 And if this -- if this is accepted, it 

places an impossible drag on the associational rights. 

The candidate will have to think twice before ever 

hiring or enlisting a volunteer who is a political 

activist. He will want to recruit the best, the most 

talented, the most savvy, but he will always have to ask 

himself: What will this person do 3 years from now that 

might disqualify me from -- from embarking on my duty 

that I was elected to engage in?

relationship, and that lobbyist says "I, too, am on

hurt Mr. Carrigan. That -- you know, that -- that would 

be something every legislator would -- would worry about 

and say, oh, boy, we've got to change this.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: So why don't we let them 

change it?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. Yet the 

legislature comes in with an amicus brief to this Court 

and says that its interpretation of this statute is all 

it needs to have is a relationship that is analogous or

parallel to those -- this is on page 32 of their amicus 

brief -- analogous or parallel, and they are defending 

the application of this statute to political loyalty.

 But let's look at the other side of the 

equation; that is the -- the Vasquezes of the world, the 

NRA advocate. On that side of the equation, anyone who 

deeply holds a view that's political -- let's say it's 

Mr. Vasquez, he is pro-development. They will refrain 

from joining campaigns out of fear that when they join 

the campaign, they will get the candidate disqualified.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So why -- I mean, what the 

commission says is Mr. Vasquez has been a close personal 

friend, confidante, and political advisor throughout the 

years. So that doesn't sound like any volunteer. It 

sounds like somebody sitting on a case where his best 

friend is likely to gain millions of dollars.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That -­

JUSTICE BREYER: That's what it seems when I 

read that opinion, that they're thinking all these 

things combined is what causes this to fall within the 

category of a reasonable person might have doubts about 

the independence of judgment.

gestalt at the end.

Carrigan's campaigns," and they go through a long 

narrative about the political relationship. These were

JUSTICE BREYER: That's part of it. But

I look at when there's a question, as others do, and 

those seven volumes contain dozens of opinions of a 

committee trying to apply vague statutes and vague 

rules -- not constitutionally vague, but generally.

the same thing here?

Amendment analysis?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I don't know why the court 

didn't address it. It was front and center. It was a 

section -- it was called overbreadth, but for eight 

pages, from page 9 to page 18, there is extensive 

discussion that what they meant by overbreadth is this 

reaches too broad, this reaches relationships that 

should not be reached. It was not in the cert 

opposition, but it was front and center before the 

Nevada Supreme Court.

You told us that the four specific categories, member of 

the household, employer, that those are all right 

because they're specific. But you don't like the 

"substantially similar." Is there any catch-all that a 

legislature could adopt that would pass what you -­

what's constitutional?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- it's hard to imagine 

one. Let me just point out, no -- it is very, very rare 

for a legislature to do anything other than what's in A 

through D.

 And the problem with this catch-all, which 

by the way is the term that was used by both the courts 

below -- the problem with this catch-all is perhaps the 

words are okay, maybe. I mean, I can imagine someone 

interpreting those words so narrowly that they're okay. 

But what this catch-all does is to add language to the 

original four criteria, so it's not just family members 

and business associates. It's now friends, close 

friends.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You didn't answer my 

question, which is since the Judiciary uses what's

to use a common law, case-by-case method of elucidating

that one who engages has to use a -- a definitive 

rule-based method rather than a common law method? So 

my question there would be, assuming your difference 

between the branches is right, still why?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And the answer is that the 

candidate and the volunteer have to know ex ante whether 

to engage in this relationship or not.

ex ante? There was an advisory process that was set up 

by the Nevada commission here.

or does it not fit?

process, the problem with it is that it comes too late.

they've got to tell them before they're engaged in the

potential -- I think I might run for office next year 

and so I'm going to get advice from some committee as to

because you can't know what's going to come out 3 years 

later. You can't know what conflicts will arise, and so 

you don't know in advance. You can't present the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I've kind 

of lost the thread of your argument. Is this a 

vagueness claim or a First Amendment claim? I gather 

your claim is going to be the same even if the statute 

clearly said family members, you know, business 

partners, and political consultants.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Correct, Your Honor; and it 

is both. There are basically two halves to it. One is, 

even if statute were perfectly clear, this is a 

relationship that the State is not allowed to view as

toxic, because it is not a toxic relationship in a 

democratic process; and secondly, this is also vague, so 

there was no notice up front as to the fact that the 

commission would later invalidate the result of the 

election on this basis.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your vagueness 

argument, is that a First Amendment argument of its own?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: It is a baseline vagueness 

argument on due process grounds, but it gets elevated 

because of the First Amendment interest.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we can decide 

your vagueness -- if we agree with you on vagueness, we 

don't have to determine whether the First Amendment 

applies in this type of situation?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Oh, that is correct, Your 

Honor, absolutely.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the -- in the Nevada 

court you argued overbreadth. That was the -- at least 

how the court understood your challenge, and here 

overbreadth takes a back seat, and vagueness is the 

principle on which you rely dominantly.

 So what accounts for the shift? You were 

arguing overbreadth before the Nevada Supreme Court.

that the Nevada Supreme Court shifted. So before the

Nevada Supreme Court, everything was on the table. 

There was vagueness, there was overbreadth, there was 

extended relationships -- extending to a relationship 

that's First Amendment-protected.

 The two key pieces, first was vagueness and 

then second was this overbreadth argument as I've 

described it, which really was about the protected 

relationship. The Nevada Supreme Court called it 

overbreadth, but if you look carefully at what it 

actually says, it is vagueness at every step of the way.

16 and 17. It is talking about the Constitution

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the standard for 

vagueness that we apply? We apply vagueness to First 

Amendment prohibitions or restrictions on speech. We 

apply vagueness to criminal statutes. This isn't a 

criminal statute. It does have a civil penalty. What 

is the case that I consult to see what standard of 

vagueness I apply?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Gentile, Your Honor. 

Gentile is a case that is about sanctions. It's about 

sanctions for First Amendment-protected activity. And 

the standard really is -- I mean, it's articulated the 

same way in all these circumstances, but it really is,

lighter medicine, less severe medicine than an outright 

ban or a punishment for that association. That's the

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Oh -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if your client 

didn't have a suspicion that he was on the edge of a 

law, why did he bother going to the city attorney to get

because I just wanted to make sure; I am not a lawyer. 

And the city attorney, of course, gave an opinion 

that gave him a clean bill of health, said: Yes, go 

forth and do this.

 Now, if the lawyer doesn't know and the 

commissioners can't settle on which of these things the

can't choose one, how is it possible for someone in

what the commission did here, which was to say we see 

these four categories, we are not applying any of these 

four categories. We're saying -- we're extracting a 

principle. It's a principle of closeness.

 Now, close enough for government work when 

it comes to relationships that are First Amendment 

protected just isn't good enough when it -- when you're 

talking about that context.

So I did want to talk just for a moment 

about the degree of burden that we're talking about 

here, because the commission seems to be saying no big 

deal, this is just a disqualification provision. It's 

not actually a burden at all.

 Now, I think we all agree that if the State 

of Nevada declared that anyone who is a campaign manager 

can never lobby the legislature, that would be 

unconstitutional, and they'll fine them for it, where 

the strict scrutiny would also apply if the State passed 

a law fining a candidate for choosing a campaign manager 

who lobbies the legislature.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm not sure I understand 

that, Mr. Rosenkranz. There are many laws out there 

that say people who serve in certain government 

capacities, when they leave those jobs, can't lobby for 

a certain number of years. How is that any different?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: It would be subject to 

scrutiny for sure. It would be subject to First 

Amendment scrutiny. And that would be justified on the 

ground not of the closeness of relationships that are 

formed, but on the ground that you don't want 

legislators here and now as they are sitting in the 

chamber thinking about generating business with their 

future clients and changing their votes because of that.

That's the justification.

 But there's no such justification here. The 

commission has never articulated why political loyalty 

is so toxic that it needs to be banished from politics. 

And so, just on the -- on the directness of the burden 

yet, for a political activist who is engaged in these 

sorts of relationships, the burden of being told, you've 

got to choose right at the outset, are you going to 

represent -- are you going to help this candidate get 

elected or are you going to lobby? That is worse than a 

fine, because a political activist wants to do both 

precisely because they care about the ultimate results.

 And for the candidate himself who is 

deciding right upfront which of the universe of players 

am I going to take as volunteers, they need to know 

upfront whether this relationship will be viewed as 

toxic, and if it is, they will not engage in that 

relationship.

 This is no less direct than the burden that 

this Court recognized as unconstitutional in the Davis 

case, the Millionaire's Amendment Case, or in Burdick, 

where the only burden was that the paid petitioner would 

have to register to vote, which is a nominal burden, but 

those whose consciences were affected by a registration 

were kept out of the process.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ELWOOD: Now, my colleague argues that 

the Nevada recusal statute targets political 

association, and that is simply not the case. Nothing 

in the statute about politics. Mr. Carrigan was recused 

because he had a business relationship with Mr. Vasquez. 

Wholly apart from the personal relationship and the fact 

that he was his three-time campaign manager, he was also 

the firm -- the campaign's main outside vendor, and 89 

percent of the Carrigan campaign expenditures were paid 

through his advertising firm. That is -­

JUSTICE BREYER: I think his argument is --

I don't see -- that the Ethics Commission at least in 

part relied upon the fact that he was the campaign 

manager, and he is saying, I think, as I understand it, 

or at least I have this question, that an ethics 

commission cannot disqualify a legislator on the ground, 

even in part, that an individual had a political 

association with him previously.

then?

it burdens associations so much that it's chilling, and 

I mean, basically I think that's a -- an empirical 

question. And because you have to have a particular 

interest, a private interest in order to be recused, I 

think that it wouldn't arise so frequently that it would 

be a problem; but I think more fundamentally here, or at 

least for purposes of this case, because it comes here 

at least Respondent says this as an as-applied 

challenge.

 What we have here is a relationship that was 

front page news, because this isn't just some plain 

vanilla campaign volunteer. This is somebody with whom 

he has a very intimate business relationship that -­

that involved this expenditure of $46,000.

 And I think another thing that is worth 

noting is that in 10 years on the books this law has 

never been applied to campaign volunteers. It's -- in 

order -- campaign volunteers specifically come up in the 

legislative history of the '99 Act, and they would say 

would not, without more, be covered, because what this 

covers is the same types of relationships that every 

other recusal statute covers -- very close relationships 

and relationships that give rise to a financial interest 

in the public official.

made extensive independent expenditures in support of 

the -- the public officer's prior campaign, and the 

public officer may hope that they -- similar 

expenditures will be made in the future. Would that be 

a basis?

 MR. ELWOOD: I don't think it would be a 

basis under the Nevada law. Because that's a law -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Why not?

 MR. ELWOOD: Because it's not a -- it's not 

a personal relationship, it's not household, it's not 

relative, it's not employer, and it's not a business 

relationship.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there a way to get 

advice as to -- I think you said he went to the county 

attorney, he could have gone to -- to the ethics 

commission, and they were told ethics commissions can 

give advice only after the -- is in office, they don't 

give -- they are not obliged to give advice to 

candidates. So when Carrigan is running he apparently 

has no access to the ethics commission?

 MR. ELWOOD: I think that that's right. The 

ethics commission only has authority to give opinions to 

sitting candidates.

 If there are no further questions -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
