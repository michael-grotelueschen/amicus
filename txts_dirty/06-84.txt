 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument

versus Burr, and 06-100, GEICO General Insurance Company 

versus Edo. 

Ms. Mahoney.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I'd like to turn first to the Ninth 

Circuit's interpretation of the term "willfully" and its 

determination that the case had to be remanded for 

further proceedings to permit an opportunity to explore 

Petitioners' communications with their counsel. We ask 

this Court to find that there is no necessity for any 

such inquiry for waivers of attorney-client privilege 

because summary judgment should have been affirmed in 

this case.

 Petitioners and their counsel, if you think 

about what communications you might find, they could not 

have known anything more about these statutory issues of 

first impression than the district court did. It's 

questions of law. And if the district court's opinion

does not reflect reckless disregard for the law, for the 

reading of the statute, then it would be inappropriate 

to characterize Petitioners' adoption of the very same 

views as either a knowing or reckless violation of the, 

of the FCRA.

 The first -- the Ninth Circuit nevertheless 

reached a contrary conclusion, and said it was time to 

go ahead and look at privileged communications if the 

Petitioners wanted to defend the case, because they made 

self-interpretive errors about the meaning of willfully.

 And the first is that they read willfully in 

this setting to mean recklessly, and relied on several 

cases where this Court has read the term willfully in 

civil statutes to mean recklessly.

 But this Court has said repeatedly that the 

word willfully is contextual, that you have to look at 

all of the sections of the statute to see how it's used 

to determine whether it means with knowledge that your 

conduct violates the law, or whether reckless violations 

are sufficient. And in this particular statute, unlike 

the other three that were at issue, Congress has used 

the term willfully in other sections of the law to mean, 

as Plaintiffs concede, that the Defendant knows that 

their conduct violates the Act.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's also used in the

phrase "knowing and willfully." That appears in several 

other parts of the statute, and that wouldn't make any 

sense if the only meaning of willful is knowing.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, it actually says 

"willfully and knowingly --"

 JUSTICE SCALIA: In one formulation or 

another, but it combines the two words, knowing and 

willful.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, this Court, though, has 

held that willfully and knowingly, when that phrase is 

used together, it's been discussed in a number of cases 

including Dixon recently, that it means -- willfully 

means knowledge that the conduct violates the law, and 

knowingly means knowledge of the relevant facts. And 

that would make perfect sense in this setting, and so 

the term willfully when, again, used --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean willfully alone?

 MS. MAHONEY: It --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where it -- where 

it means what you think it means, which is knowingly, 

that does not mean knowing the facts? If you mistake 

the facts and are laboring under a misimpression of the 

facts, you have nonetheless willfully violated the law?

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, in Ratzlaf, the 

phrase was willfully, not willfully and knowingly, and

the Court held that it meant that you knew that your 

conduct violated the law. And that seems to be the most 

reasonable reading here because if you look, there are 

also sections of Section 1681n that refer to knowing 

conduct, and that would require the conclusion that 

Congress used willfully in this section to mean a -- a 

less -- a more -- a less culpable mens rea than 

knowingly. And that's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if you're 

the CEO of your company, and a lawyer -- Federal counsel 

comes in and says we've got a real issue under the Fair 

Credit Reporting Act, I need to brief you on that, we 

need to make an important decision about whether we are 

complying, you say I don't want to hear about it, I 

don't want to know about it. That would not be 

willfully violating the statute?

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, under -- some cases have 

suggested that there could be a willful blindness 

instruction that would govern whether you define that as 

knowing or not. Certainly --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it doesn't have 

to be actual knowledge?

 MS. MAHONEY: I think that the best reading 

of knowingly is actual knowledge or something that is, 

that is everything but, you know, that really is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How about reckless 

disregard?

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, conscious disregard is a 

recklessness standard, and even if the Ninth Circuit 

correctly determined that this should be interpreted as 

a recklessness standard, this Court has defined 

recklessness to mean that it has to be conscious 

disregard, actual knowledge of a high risk of, of -- of 

harm or in this case illegality. And in these 

circumstances, you can't say that there was a high risk 

of illegality because what the district court found is 

that the Petitioners' interpretations of the statute 

were actually not only reasonable, but correct, and 

having --

JUSTICE ALITO: Since the term knowingly or 

knowing appears in two places in 1681n, can't we infer 

from that that willfully in that provision also means 

something different?

 MS. MAHONEY: I think the way it's used, it 

says knowing, knowingly that they did not have a 

permissible purpose. Permissible purpose, that may not 

be knowledge of the law, it just may be knowledge that 

your purpose wasn't permissible. And even if they were 

using it --

JUSTICE ALITO: I thought the statute says

what the permissible purposes are.

 MS. MAHONEY: It does, but it doesn't 

necessarily mean that the individual knew precisely what 

the statute said. Because for instance, users are told 

what the permissible purposes are when they get a credit 

report from, from a credit agency. But more 

importantly, Your Honor, I think that the use of the 

term knowingly there can also be explained.

 If you look at Section 1681h, it actually 

provides that certain tort actions cannot proceed unless 

there is a willful intent to injure, except as provided 

in Section 1681n, and they are the same kinds of actions 

that are carved out in 1681n.

 And so I think it was to make clear, I think 

it was to make clear that you didn't have to have a 

willful intent to injure. So even if they meant it to 

be interchangeable with a knowing violation of the law 

there, I think there was a reason for it, it wasn't just 

surplusage. It was to clarify that they didn't have to 

have a willful intent to violate.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Would you say it's all 

right to use the model penal code definition of 

reckless, which is basically what you -- taking it here, 

you would have to consciously disregard a substantial 

and unjustifiable risk that the action is unlawful?

MS. MAHONEY: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If you come across anything 

that would use that, I mean "reckless" itself is 

unclear. The model penal code tried to clarify it based 

on this Court's opinions primarily.

 MS. MAHONEY: But I think you can look to 

the way this Court described recklessness in Farmer vs. 

Brennan as well, though, as well as --

JUSTICE BREYER: What's the difference?

 MS. MAHONEY: The difference is just, there 

is two forms of recklessness. One which says that if 

the risk is sufficiently high, if a person should have 

known, you could be -- you could be liable. But that 

the form of recklessness that Congress presumably used 

here in this setting, where there is the potential for 

very punitive sanctions, was what is referred to --

Farmer versus Brennan calls it "criminal," the criminal 

recklessness standard.

 And that means that not only do you have to 

have an objectively high risk of illegality, but you 

must be actually conscious of that risk. But in this 

case, you don't even need to get to the issue of 

consciousness.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you said there is no 

way they couldn't have been conscious of the risk here.

I mean, after all, that's why they went to lawyers. 

They know there's risk that this is unlawful.

 MS. MAHONEY: The question is --

JUSTICE BREYER: But consciousness, I mean, 

maybe it should come in in the standard, but I don't 

know that that would help you.

 MS. MAHONEY: I think the issue of conscious 

-- the risk, though, it has to be a high risk. And if 

it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute, or 

even if it is an interpretation of the statute that is 

fairly debatable, that you have a fair chance of 

success, then how can you say that is a high risk of 

illegality, so high that we should say that Congress 

wanted to sanction you for taking that position?

 And for saying that, you know, you shouldn't 

be permitted to adopt a compliance program if there was 

a fair ground for believing that it was lawful. And 

here what the Ninth Circuit did --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose there is a fair 

ground for believing it was lawful. Lawyers are in 

disagreement, but in fact, I believe the lawyers who say 

it is unlawful, and I nonetheless go ahead and do it. 

Is that a willful violation?

 MS. MAHONEY: I don't, I don't think so, 

Your Honor, if, in fact, it was a fair ground for -- -

JUSTICE SCALIA: But I think I'm violating.

 MS. MAHONEY: I don't -- yes. But you 

couldn't know you were violating it, and because if it 

really is a fair ground for litigation --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm a better lawyer than my 

advisors.

 (Laughter.)

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think if it's an 

area where the law is truly unsettled. And here an 

issue of first impression, a lawyer's assessment that 

you may lose is inherently predictive. These are not 

true or false answers when there is almost nothing to go 

on.

 And so in that area, it's much like what 

this Court did in Screws, where it said that this was a 

case involving a willful violation of, or interference 

with rights secured by -- by Federal law. And what the 

Court says, well, it's not just any bad purpose that 

Congress had in mind, it is a bad purpose to defy 

announced rules of law. They have to be, there has to 

be sufficient clarity in the law to say that there was a 

high risk of illegality that you could disregard.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would you look to the 

subjective intent of the actor at all?

 MS. MAHONEY: Only --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or would you just look to 

the outcome and say, well, you know, it was a close 

question, so even if the actor indeed thought he was in 

violation, it was a close question; it's okay?

 MS. MAHONEY: I don't think you would look 

at the intent until you found that there -- there was no 

reasonable ground or at least no, no -- no fair ground 

for debate about the question. And at that point, Your 

Honor, if there was an objectively high risk of 

illegality, then you do have to ask, what were they 

consciously aware of; what did they do?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I must say that -- that is 

not the normal meaning of willful, willfully violating 

the law.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, I think in Screws --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're changing it to mean 

willfully, willfully and blatantly violating the law.

 MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if I know that what 

I'm doing is in violation of the law, even if it's a 

close question, it seems to me I am willfully violating 

the law.

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, Screws says you 

can't know the unknowable. And if the law, if it's 

really, truly an issue of first impression, you may

think you're violating the law, but you -- you can't 

know the unknowable. And that's why this setting is so 

important, because you can't, you know, put -- impose 

sanctions. Here we're talking about the potential for 

an industry facing billions of dollars without any 

actual harm to -- to individuals. And that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it really billions? 

How many of these have been certified as class actions?

 MS. MAHONEY: I believe that there are two 

certified class actions. But many -- there are many 

cases pending and it could be billions of dollars, Your 

Honor. Certainly if the classes are certified, and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you, would you, as 

representative of the insurers, would you have a sound 

objection to class action certification in these cases?

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I'm sure there 

would be some bases to resist. But classes have been 

certified, so I --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And gone to, gone to 

judgment?

 MS. MAHONEY: I do not believe any have gone 

to judgment, but I don't, I don't -- I think that the 

point is that if you allow a thousand dollar penalty or 

the potential for a thousand dollar penalty for every 

consumer who didn't get a notice, simply because they

may have gotten a better price if they had even better 

credit, across the country, if you interpret the statute 

that way, and then you can say you can get this thousand 

dollar, what is in essence a penalty, and you multiply 

that by the number of consumers, then you certainly have 

the potential for very, very substantial liability.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a question how many 

will sue for a thousand dollars, given the litigation 

costs.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, given that these are 

proceeding as class actions, the answer is there is 

plenty on the line to incentivize plaintiffs' attorneys 

to bring these class actions, and they have been 

brought, and this is a class action. There are two 

class actions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They haven't -- neither 

has been certified, has it?

 MS. MAHONEY: No, it has not. They are 

putative class actions, Your Honor. But I, but I think 

that whether it's a class action or not, we have to look 

at what did, what did Congress presumably have in mind 

when it authorized these kinds of penalties and punitive 

damages based on a willful violation in a technical area 

where there is no potential for harm? And certainly --

questions on, on willful and then -- because you may 

want to talk about the other issue in the case. First, 

you began by saying that here a district judge has come 

to the contrary conclusion; by definition, it can't be 

reckless. Do you have any authority, where we -- for 

that proposition, where we have said that?

 MS. MAHONEY: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: We find all the time that 

a right is not clearly established under AEDPA, and so 

forth -- and disregard what I just said. That's my 

first question.

 And the second is willfully, as Screws 

itself makes very clear, it is interpreted differently 

in the criminal context than it is in the civil context.

 MS. MAHONEY: Except Screws, Your Honor, 

actually says that it was adopting a criminal 

recklessness standard, not a knowing standard, but a 

reckless standard. And that is the same standard that 

has been applied in the civil cases that use willfully 

in the punitive damages context.

 So I think it's exactly the same standard in 

that Screws does say that the, you can't have, it can't 

just be a bad purpose, that it has to have been a bad 

purpose to violate clearly defined rules. And this 

Court has said in various contexts in the, in the

qualified immunity area that picking the losing side 

does not mean that your conduct was objectively, you 

know, wrongful.

 And that's really -- I think that there is 

great significance to the district court's ruling. I'm 

not saying that in every case, it would absolutely be 

dispositive. I think you have to look at what was the, 

you know, the clarity of the law, what was the reasoning 

of the district court. But what the Ninth Circuit did 

is that it, in essence, said that you can't rely on 

creative but unlikely answers to issues of first 

impression.

 Well, if an administration official goes to 

a lawyer in the administration and asks about a course 

of conduct, and is told, well, it's completely an issue 

of first impression, there is probably a 40 percent 

chance of success, do you say it's reckless to proceed 

on that basis?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just because 

an issue is one of first impression doesn't mean there's 

a high degree of uncertainty. The statute may be 

clearly addressed to that issue. It hasn't come up 

before.

 MS. MAHONEY: Absolutely, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: First impression.

MS. MAHONEY: It certainly -- this Court has 

made clear that if the language of the statute is very 

plain, then, of course, that can be noticed, that can be 

adequate warning. But certainly this statute doesn't 

satisfy that standard. Congress didn't provide the 

benchmarks that you have to use for comparison to 

determine whether there has been an increase in a charge 

or whether there has been an adverse action based on the 

consumer report. You need benchmarks to answer those 

questions, and there aren't any regulations and there 

were no cases.

 If I could save the balance of my time for 

rebuttal.

MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Court of Appeals correctly concluded 

that willfulness in the civil context, as is used here, 

includes a reckless disregard component or a 

recklessness component. That is what this Court has 

held in a number of cases that have similar uses of 

willfulness focused on a departure from the law, have

held. Thurston, Richland Shoe and Hazen Paper are the 

three that have been most discussed in the case, in the 

papers here.

 But where the Ninth Circuit misstepped here 

was in the application of that standard. And in 

particular, we agreed with Petitioners that when it 

concluded that a creative but unlikely position 

constitutes recklessness, it erred. Recklessness speaks 

an extreme deviation from an ordinary standard of care. 

It requires that the defendant act in the face of or 

fail to act --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It is a subjective 

standard or an objective standard?

 MS. MILLETT: It has both in this context. 

It is, I think, first and foremost, an objective 

component, because there is -- this is a civil case. 

It's not purely subjective. And that objective 

component is very important because that is what makes 

the act or inaction reckless, and that is the risk. 

There has to be an objectively high and obvious risk.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So if the potential 

liability, as in these cases, is huge, then you have to 

be even more careful because there is liability so 

great. So is it the greater the liability -- the 

greater chance of recklessness, the greater the

potential liability?

 MS. MILLETT: No, to the extent you're 

talking about dollar liability, I don't think that's 

true. I do think it's fair to say that in recklessness 

generally in the tort law, the more serious an injury 

that could result, can -- we'll tolerate less risk. If 

the risk is causing serious bodily injury or death to 

somebody, we'll -- the law will tolerate a lesser degree 

of risk than it will if, if it's simply causing, you 

know, a delay in something or a sort of paper injury or 

maybe even a dollar injury.

 And it's not set. It's a variable 

calculation. So in that sense, it is. I don't think 

that when we talk about a high and objective risk in 

this context, we are talking about the dollars that a, 

that a company would have to pay, although I'm sure they 

are interested in hearing about that from their lawyers.

 What we are talking about here -- and this 

is a very unusual statute the way it's written -- the 

liability itself, not just the damages, but the 

liability itself turns upon the extent of departure from 

law. You have to -- there is no recovery here like 

there is in almost -- or commonly in Federal statutes 

for just a violation. That isn't it.

 You have to show either a willful violation

or a negligent violation, and that requires a 

determination not only that the defendants violated the 

law, but a determination as to how much, how far, how 

many standard deviations from correct their position was 

and that is an objective determination.

 Once an objectively high risk has been found 

by a court, then -- then the case can shift to looking 

into subjective things. I think a plaintiff would be 

entitled, once an objectively high and obvious risk has 

been found by the court, to rely on that, and allow a 

jury to, or a judge, whoever is deciding the case, to 

infer the existence of willfulness from that. And 

that's often when defendants -- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I also ask, do you 

agree with the Petitioner on the meaning of adverse 

action?

 MS. MILLETT: No, we agree with Respondents 

on the meaning of adverse action.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Correct me if I'm 

wrong. You think if I have an insurance policy, I'm 

paying a certain rate, they look at my credit report and 

they say, you know, good news, we're going to lower your 

rates, that's an adverse action because they might have 

lowered the rates even further if they had notified me 

about the credit report and there were some errors in

it?

 MS. MILLETT: Right. It's a complicated 

answer, in part because that assumes that you have an 

existing account and you're not an initial account here. 

And when you have an existing account, there's a 

definition of adverse action for insurance provisions, 

but in iv there is a separate, there's another 

definition, and this is on, on page -- sorry. Excuse 

me. On page 3A of the appendix to our brief, iv under 

big I -- I'm sorry, there's a lot of provisions -- talks 

about reviewing an existing account, and it 

cross-referenced another provision which talks about 

reviewing an account for purposes of termination. And 

that would include, in our view, not only completely 

canceling it, but terminating the existing and charging 

you more for allowing you now to pay a new rate. So 

which would govern in that particular context is a 

little bit harder.

 But it could, and here's logically why, 

because I think the understanding of "increase" that's 

at issue here is one that's very basic to the operation 

of this statute, and that is, did the content of your 

information in your credit report, if it had been 

better, could you have had a better rate or a better 

deal.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

 MS. MILLETT: So have you been hit in the 

pocketbook.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if they lower, if 

they lower the rates, you still say that that fits the 

meaning of adverse action because they might have 

lowered them further if the information hadn't been 

erroneous?

 MS. MILLETT: It could have, and here -- in 

this sense, it could be: In the same way that I, sort 

of the flip side, but in my office, if everybody in the 

hallway gets a 5 percent salary increase and I only get 

a 1 percent salary increase, I am certainly better off, 

but if the reason I got a lesser increase is because of 

my gender or because of my credit report, it's an 

adverse action. So the fact that you're doing somewhat 

better doesn't mean --

JUSTICE BREYER: That isn't how the statute 

defines it.

 MS. MILLETT: Excuse me?

 JUSTICE BREYER: The statute says an adverse 

action is an increase in a charge for -- in connection 

with underwriting.

 MS. MILLETT: But it also --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's what it says. And

then it says an increase is -- and if you take an 

adverse action, i.e., if you increase it, and your 

increase is based in whole or in part on information 

contained in a consumer report, you have to send the 

thing. How did you get -- in your example, there was no 

increase. I mean, in a charge. In your salary, it's a 

decrease in the salary. Same thing.

 MS. MILLETT: The definition again on 3A 

includes not just increase, but includes an unfavorable 

change in the terms. And so it's not settled whether --

JUSTICE BREYER: You mean unfavorable change 

in terms, unfavorable change in terms.

 MS. MILLETT: Exactly.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, suppose you don't 

have, you don't have any terms because you never did it 

before. There's no change in terms.

 MS. MILLETT: If you're a new customer --

and again, I want to reiterate that, how this applies to 

existing accounts is complicated --

JUSTICE BREYER: You mean those words 

"change in terms" refer to rates, in other words? 

That's a rather odd way to refer to it. In one place, 

you refer to an "increase"; in the other place, you'd 

refer to it as a "change in terms." That's sort of an 

odd way to write a statute.

MS. MILLETT: Well, you can have a change in 

terms that is not necessarily an increase. It could be 

you will no longer be entitled to a free rental car when 

your car is in for repair for some reason. That's not 

an increase.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I understand that. 

But what we're after is this. Everybody has a credit 

report, just about. You put it in and you give people 

the best possible rate conceivable, and now, how do you 

know that maybe there could have still been a better 

rate? And it can't be that the statute intends you to 

send out notices in such circumstances or you'd have to 

send notices whenever you read a credit report. Now, I 

think that's, I've overstated slightly, but that's 

basically the argument. So what's your response?

 MS. MILLETT: And Justice Breyer, my 

response is that if the content of the information in 

your credit report would have made you -- had it been 

better information you'd have gotten a better rate, a 

better result, your pocketbook wouldn't have been hit as 

hard, you have a dollars and cents injury because of the 

content of the information, then you had an adverse 

action.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so your response is 

just to repeat my question and say that's right?

MS. MILLETT: No. If I could continue on 

that, if I could add on, if I could add on, the way 

insurance companies work is they don't have 3 million 

customers and 3 million rates. They have ranges and 

most of them will have a top tier. They may have 

specialized things for employees, but putting aside a 

specialized category, there's a top range and they will 

tell you, as they say in the briefs, that 10 to 15 

percent of people fit in there. So they know what the 

best rate is. They know what the next, above average 

rate, the standard rate.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you fit, how do you 

fit that within the language of the statute? Is it, I 

fail -- you're a first- time customer and I fail to give 

you a, you know, a break that maybe you could have had. 

Is it a denial or cancellation of insurance? No. Is it 

an increase in, an increase in any charge for insurance? 

Is it a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change 

in the terms of coverage or in the amount of any 

insurance? I find it hard to shoehorn your case into 

that language.

 MS. MILLETT: Well, to begin with, that may 

be why Petitioners' position here certainly was not 

reckless and the Ninth Circuit erred. But we do think 

that the statutory language read as a whole supports

this. It could be a denial of a particular term in an 

insurance contract. But you have to look at -- it's 

important to understand you look --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I read the term as, as one 

of the Justices here does, not referring to the rate. 

The earlier part refers to the rate. An increase in any 

charge for, that's the rate. And then it speaks of 

change in the terms of coverage. I mean, that is, you 

know, whether it covers hurricanes, or in the amount of 

the insurance, whether you're insured for --

MS. MILLETT: Or it could be a reduction in 

the terms. I mean, these things are statutory 

construction issues to be litigated, and the important 

issue here -- and they are presented in this case. 

They're to be litigated and the important issue is that 

when there is fair debate about these issues insurance 

companies will not be held to be willfully violating the 

statute if they got the answer wrong.

 But I think on the, on the substantive 

question, it's important to read "adverse action" in 

light of, if I could just finish the sentence, in light 

of the definition of when a notice is required to be 

issued, which turns upon the content of the information 

in the report.

 Thank you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. SHORR

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. SHORR: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 When Congress intended to require a knowing 

violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it expressly 

said so. It did not do so in connection with the claims 

here under Section 1681n(a)(1)(A). In each instance 

where Congress wanted to allow -- to require a higher 

mens rea, it said so and did so in connection with 

liability that was greater. They required knowing mens 

rea for the criminal provision. They required knowing 

mens rea to obtain the even higher statutory damages 

that are available under the act.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say to the 

argument from drafting history that looks at the history 

both of little n and little o and it points out that as 

originally, in the original bill, little o providing for 

the actual damages required a finding of gross

negligence? Little n used the word "willful" just as it 

does now, suggesting that willful would not include 

gross negligence or something close to gross negligence 

like recklessness. Then in, then in o, they changed the 

standard from gross negligence to mere negligence, but 

they made no change in n, which suggests that n stayed 

whatever it always was, and if the argument from 

contrast was that n probably meant knowing rather than 

reckless, it stayed knowing even when the standard was 

changed to negligence in o. What do you say to that 

argument?

 MR. SHORR: Justice Souther, I think the 

only thing we can say about that is Congress reduced the 

culpability for the actual damages from gross negligence 

to negligence. I don't think that tells us much about 

willful means, what willful means as a separate matter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the fact that they had 

originally drafted n as it is, in contrast to the 

original o, does tell us, doesn't it, something about 

what they had in mind in n. And they must have had 

something in mind, probably had in mind, something in n 

which was a standard higher than gross negligence.

 MR. SHORR: No, Justice Souter, I suggest 

that what you can infer from that is that, if anything, 

is perhaps Congress wanted to move, make clear that

under o the actual damages aren't close to willful or 

reckless, so they reduced gross negligence to negligence 

in that circumstance. But that still doesn't tell us 

separately what "willful" meant, and of course "willful" 

had been interpreted by this Court in similar cases 

involving similar statutes to mean a knowing or reckless 

disregard. And I respectfully disagree with --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I mean, there's no 

question it has been and that is sort of the usual 

reading in the civil context. But we also keep 

repeating, you know, "willful" is a word of many 

meanings and you always look to the context. And here 

the argument is that if you look to the context of the, 

of the two statutory sections right up next to each 

other, you can draw a, an inference about what "willful" 

means.

 MR. SHORR: I think if anything, Justice 

Souter, here the context should be the actual statutory 

terms used, and in Section 1681n(b) they expressly 

required the knowing standard and that's a knowing 

violation of the law, as Justice Alito's question seemed 

to draw out, a knowing impermissible purpose. And the 

statute directly defines what a permissible purpose is 

under this law.

 So that reference to knowing could not refer

to a knowing, knowing the facts. And of course, willful 

in some sense always includes some knowledge of the 

factual circumstances.

 In addition, the logical structure of the 

act -- as I mentioned, we had negligence and actual 

damages. We have a reckless standard, a knowing or 

reckless standard for certain statutory damages, but 

then an even higher level for the criminal and higher 

statutory penalty provisions. And as I started to say, 

a willful, knowing, reckless standard is entirely 

consistent with how this Court has interpreted the term 

in similar civil statutes that were in fact passed about 

the same time the Hazen Paper case and Thurston and 

McLaughlin cases interpreting the ADA and the FLSA and 

other similar cases.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, even if 

you're right about the standard, how can you suggest 

that it's willful here when you have no judicial 

construction, you have no administrative construction, 

you have the statutory language that at least the 

questions this morning have suggested is not perfectly 

clear? How can you suggest that the action of the 

companies on this case even under your standard was 

willful?

 MR. SHORR: Mr. Chief Justice, of course we

believe and the statute is in fact clear, you do not 

need further interpretation by the Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we don't agree 

with you on that, you would lose on the application of 

the willfulness standard?

 MR. SHORR: If you don't agree with us --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, 

your, your, your conclusion that this was a willful 

violation depends upon your assertion that the statute 

is perfectly clear?

 MR. SHORR: I think that there is a level of 

objective component that the statute at least has to be 

understood by a reasonable person at some level using 

standard statutory construction. But that isn't to 

suggest that the statute needs to be interpreted by a 

higher court or even a district court for counsel to get 

guidance. And of course, in this case, there was no 

guidance supporting Respondents -- excuse me -- no 

guidance supporting Petitioners', defendants', position. 

In fact, the only guidance supported our position, 

including guidance from the FTC.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're talking about 

the Ball letter?

 MR. SHORR: I am talking about the Ball 

letter.

binding on the commission, so why would that be regarded 

as authoritative?

 MR. SHORR: It was not, and we are not 

suggesting it is, although it's entitled to Chevron 

deference. But if you get past the minimal level of 

objective standard, the question becomes what indicia 

and markers were out there that would have guided this 

company as to whether there was a high risk that they 

were violating the act. And certainly the Ball letter, 

which was sent by the staff specifically to address this 

exact question and to guide insurance companies, gave 

notice and it said charging anyone a higher amount than 

the best available rate based on their credit score was 

an adverse action. And in addition, there was --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how could that be? I 

mean I agree that the statute is clear, but I think it's 

clear the other way. That is, if you look at the 

language, as you've just heard, if you look at the 

purpose it's very hard to reconcile with the purpose an 

instance where a person has continuous accidents. He's 

a reckless driver. His insurance company puts him in 

just a category below the bottom and they read his 

credit report and they discover, despite his faults, he 

always pays his bills on time. So they increase it, not

to the top category, but they give him a much better 

deal. And you're saying this statute means that what I 

just described is an adverse action based on a credit 

report?

 MR. SHORR: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay. And then if 

you're going to say yes, I want to hear why yes, and 

then in light of the following: The little boy who says 

wolf. You're probably puzzled what I mean by that. I 

mean that if you're right in that interpretation, there 

will be tens of millions of notices going out and 

they'll have the same effect on the public that these 

privacy notices have today. We get them every day, 

dozens of them, and they go right in the wastebasket, 

because they will become meaningless because to an 

average person that notice will not mean that he better 

look at his credit report. It will mean throw it in the 

wastebasket.

 All right, now I've got the purpose, I've 

got the language, and I have what I think of as common 

sense. Now, you explain why it's obvious the opposite.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a different 

question. We've been talking about willful up to now.

 MR. SHORR: Yes, and this is the adverse 

action question.

 MR. SHORR: And I'm happy to do so now.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But, was there 

anything further on willful? You said that the statute 

was clear enough and you had the FTC informal advice, 

but now we know that courts have divided on this 

question, right? On --

MR. SHORR: Divided in the sense -- well, 

the Ninth Circuit of course overturned the district 

court's ruling so there's no current division, but if 

that's what you mean, yes, Your Honor.

 In a -- I guess I'll address quickly your 

question. There's additional guidance provided by the 

FTC that was subject to formal rulemaking and that was 

16 CFR, I believe it's Part 601 Appendix C, and in that 

instance the FTC, again subject to formal notice and 

comment of rulemaking, said that the statute is defined 

very broadly and it includes any action that can even be 

considered to have a negative impact. And that plays in 

the subjective aspect as well, but addressing your 

question, Justice Breyer, first on the statutory 

language --

 MR. SHORR: That was guidance, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is guidance?

 MR. SHORR: That was guidance. That was

statute, it should be read broadly.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you know, I would tell 

my CEO ignore that, that it's meaningless.

 MR. SHORR: In addition, the CEO would have 

the guidance provided by the Ball letter.

 But again addressing your question, Justice 

Breyer, an increase based on credit, if we had let's say 

an increase based on race, someone goes in and has a 

product to buy and there's the best rate, and they 

charge someone else based on their race a higher rate, 

certainly that's an increase based on credit. There's 

only one best rate.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But this is not an 

antidiscrimination provision. It doesn't say anyone who 

discriminates in the setting of race has to send out 

letters. It requires an adverse action. It requires an 

increase in the charge.

MR. SHORR: And Your Honor, I was only using 

that example to try and explain the statutory language.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It doesn't explain it 

because if you have an increase in the charge based on 

race, of course that's an increase based on race.

 MR. SHORR: Well, here we have --

JUSTICE BREYER: And if you refuse to give a 

person the best rate, and lower his rate but not the 

best rate, based on race, that is not an increase based 

on race. That is discrimination based on race.

 MR. SHORR: You're charging someone more 

based on credit.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's true, and it's a 

discrimination, but you didn't increase the rate. You 

decreased it.

 MR. SHORR: I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's still a 

discrimination, it's still unlawful.

 MR. SHORR: Applying it to credit, a natural 

definition that is charging someone more than you charge 

others is an increase.

 JUSTICE ALITO: When you say more, in order 

for there to be an adverse action there has to be an 

increase or an unfavorable change. And when you have an 

initial application you have to figure out what is the

baseline in order to determine whether there has been an 

increase or an adverse action. And you and the 

Solicitor General just assert that the baseline in that 

situation is the best possible rate that you can get, 

but I don't understand where that comes from.

 MR. SHORR: Because charging someone more 

than someone else who qualifies for that better rate 

based on their credit, is increasing them, charging them 

more, but it's also evident from the statutory purpose, 

which I think was a question you asked --

JUSTICE BREYER: Let me look at the 

language. Go back to give me -- because in ordinary 

English, which I hope I speak, it is not an increase, 

but maybe there is a technical term in the technical 

language of commercial law or in FTC law where the word 

increase means decrease. And if you -- is there 

anything you want -- no. It's a serious question, at 

least if you want to cite me to some authority that uses 

this word increase in the way you just suggested.

 MR. SHORR: We believe that it's a standard 

dictionary definition, to charge someone more for 

insurance than they would otherwise qualify for is 

increasing their charge.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Which dictionary shall I 

look at?

MR. SHORR: I think we can look at any 

dictionary. I don't have a cite, Your Honor, but --

JUSTICE SOUTER: They're making this 

argument, and I think you got close to it a minute ago 

when you alluded to statutory purpose. I think this is 

what's behind, and you tell me if I'm wrong. One 

purpose of the statute is to alert a consumer that the 

consumer's credit report may contain errors which are 

doing the consumer some kind of damage.

 MR. SHORR: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And you want this consumer 

alerted so the consumer can ask to see the report and 

correct it if possible.

 MR. SHORR: That's exactly right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Reading the adverse action 

the way you read it, it would give the consumer or 

consumers a tip-off in the maximum number of cases. In 

every case in which the consumer might have done better 

if the credit report had assumed different facts, on 

your reading theoretically, the consumer is going to say 

I want to look at that report and correct it if it's 

wrong. But isn't the fallacy of that argument the 

fallacy of saying because that is one object of the 

statute, every term within the statute has got to be 

read in a way that maximizes the effectuation of that

object? And the trouble that we're having on the bench 

is that discrimination and increase are different terms. 

Increase says the rate actually goes up from a baseline 

that the consumer previously had, whereas discrimination 

does not. And your reading in effect, increase to mean 

discrimination in order to maximize the likelihood that 

the consumer will look at the report, isn't that the 

basis of your argument?

 MR. SHORR: I think it has to be an increase 

based on some aspect, but the only way to give effect to 

that statutory purpose is an increase above what you 

would otherwise qualify for had you had better credit 

and of course --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's a way to give 

every conceivable effect to that policy. But the 

statute in drafting adverse, or drafting the terms of 

adverse action, may very well have said we don't want to 

give every conceivable effect to this purpose because if 

we do, we'll get into the situation that Justice Breyer 

described. Everybody will be getting notices and the 

notices will be meaningless.

 MR. SHORR: I don't think the notice is 

problematic because you're alerting the consumer to 

check that the information that the insurance company 

expressly relied on to increase your charge --

JUSTICE SOUTER: To set the charge. I mean, 

that's circular. To set the charge that it gives you.

 MR. SHORR: I don't think you need a prior 

charge to suffer an increase. If I walk into a candy 

store and I've never purchased that candy before but the 

best price that day is 5 cents but they say we're going 

to charge you 10 cents, I've certainly suffered an 

increase.

 JUSTICE BREYER: By that you're talking 

linguistically, but I am interested in the purpose. So 

I looked up on the Internet approximately what percent 

of the people have the best credit score and that's 

about 1 percent. So 99 percent of the public doesn't 

have the best possible credit score. Now I take it that 

means that you could in fact, if it's even roughly 

right, have 99 percent or a little less or even perhaps 

a little more when they look at that report that, since 

it's not perfect in 99 percent of the cases, it's quite 

possible that they won't get the best conceivable rate 

which might be reserved for just perfect people. And if 

that's so, in 99 percent of the cases they'll send out 

notices. And that's why I asked my question about the 

boy who calls wolf. What will happen if 99 percent of 

the people who apply for insurance or any other thing 

get notices? I suspect that this is only intuitive,

that the notices are more likely to go into the 

wastebasket than they are if there was really a 

decrease. Now, do you have any light you can shed on 

that?

 MR. SHORR: Sure. The -- as an initial 

matter, it's not the perfect credit that is the 

standard, it's whatever would qualify you for GEICO's 

best rate. And that's a much broader standard. We 

don't know the exact amounts but if you look at GEICO JA 

6768, they have fairly broad tiers, maybe five or six. 

And of course not everyone is going to get the notice. 

If your driving record totally eliminates -- if you have 

great credit but your driving record eliminates the 

possibility that you qualify for the better rate, you 

wouldn't get notice in that circumstance either. But 

the key to the notice is, if I have very good credit but 

the information that the insurance company looks at is 

incorrect, I will be charged more based on incorrect 

information without ever having the opportunity to tell 

the insurance company or whoever is collecting that 

information for them, you've charged me the wrong amount 

and I in fact qualify for that better rate.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't you have that 

right independently, though, every year to look at a 

copy of your credit report?

MR. SHORR: Well, what's significant here, 

that has been added to the statute in the last two 

years. But since 1970, Congress's concern is giving 

notice at a critical time, when the insurance company 

tells you we are relying on it and we may have taken an 

adverse action.

 I wanted to also mention, here it's not just 

an increase. There's also been a denial, and that 

Mr. Edo applied for insurance from GEICO, and was denied 

insurance with the stand-alone company GEICO General, so 

that is also an adverse action under the act.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say you 

look at the increase with respect to the best credit 

rate, why is that? Why wouldn't you look at it relative 

to say the average insured who walks in the door?

 MR. SHORR: Because that -- GEICO's 

argument, and I think that's what they want, presumes 

they're looking at accurate credit information. And the 

problem is, Congress has always told that there is 

significant inadequacy in the credit information. I 

think it's cited in the National Consumer Law Center 

brief. In 1996, Congress was told that the error rate 

in consumer information was 50 percent and there was a 

20 percent serious error in the rates. Under GEICO's 

interpretation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand 

what pertinence that has to my question which is, why do 

you get to pick the best credit report as the baseline 

from which you would measure your hypothetical increase?

 MR. SHORR: Because under GEICO's theory of 

the statute you may never get notice, even though you're 

being charged more for insurance based on inaccurate 

information, as long as you're not charge -- your charge 

doesn't move below average. So a lot of people who are 

in fact intended to be protected under this act will not 

be protected until their charge goes below average, even 

though the insurance company is continuing to charge 

them more based on inaccurate information.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why do we -- how do we know 

that they were intended to be protected in this way by 

getting this notice? That's the issue in the case.

 MR. SHORR: Because going through the 

statute and the increase based on credit, and then the 

notice will give them the opportunity to check. Since 

the consumer here is the -- it's a system of checks and 

balances, and unless you give this consumer the 

opportunity to check that they are in fact using the 

correct information, it wasn't mistaken, it wasn't 

driven down by identity theft, you can continue to 

charge people more --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So that's --

MR. SHORR: -- based on inaccurate 

information.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Your basic argument is the 

statute, the definitions of adverse action have got to 

be read in a way that maximizes the occasion upon which 

a consumer will get a notice that may lead that consumer 

to ask to see his credit report. That's your basic 

premise?

 MR. SHORR: Both based on the premise and 

purpose of statute, yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right.

 MR. SHORR: Briefly addressing the 

application of the standard to the facts in this case, 

we do think it's appropriate to remand for further 

consideration in light of some new developments. GEICO 

has just recently produced documents to us that 

addressly -- directly address the question of scienter 

here, so if there's -- if you go past a minimum 

threshold --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I've read your reference 

to those documents. Explain why you think that's so 

important.

address the subject of standard here, that GEICO was

reckless or understood their --

JUSTICE STEVENS: How do those documents 

shed any light on recklessness? I didn't see that.

 MR. SHORR: I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: How do the documents that 

you describe shed any light on the extent of their 

recklessness, if any?

 MR. SHORR: I want to be careful, because I 

had presented -- I asked to lodge them with the Court 

and I can quote them if necessary, but within those 

documents there is direct evidence that GEICO 

interpreted the statute exactly how we do, that not 

putting someone in the best tier based on credit --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Who's GEICO? I 

mean, you're talking about particular lawyers at a 

particular level, an ongoing debate about what this law 

means. If you get one lawyer who says, you know, I 

think you could read it this way, does that mean that 

GEICO reads it that way?

 MR. SHORR: No, Your Honor. In this 

instance, this document involves top level GEICO 

executives. And with respect to the advice of counsel 

issue, frankly it's a red herring. We have never asked 

to compel the Defendants in either of these cases or any 

of the cases we're involved in, to waive their

privilege. They've got the right, of course, to offer 

advice of counsel as an affirmative -- as a defense in 

this case, but we don't believe it's necessary to prove 

our case to even reach what the counsel said. We 

believe we can prove our case based on the documents and 

subjective intent alone.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I still don't really 

understand this part of the case very much. Assume that 

a lawyer writes a letter saying you read it two or three 

different ways, read the statute, it's very ambiguous, 

and we think the government's reading is the better 

reading. And the executives think about it and they say 

no, we don't think that's right. Has that proved 

reckless disregard?

 MR. SHORR: If the statute was clear and the 

guidance --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If the statute's clear. 

And of course, Miss Mahoney said the district judge 

thought it was clear, but the other way.

 MR. SHORR: And with respect to the district 

court, we believe the district court here clearly erred, 

as the Ninth Circuit found. And the guidance -- that 

opinion certainly didn't precede the conduct that's at 

issue here. The only guidance, again, available at the 

time supported our reading of the statute. There was no

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MS. MAHONEY: If I could start by just 

responding to the issue of the new document, I just want 

to emphasize that this document was created by people 

who weren't lawyers. It was done before GEICO even 

started using credit to price insurance. They were --

said they were brainstorming about what the statute 

might mean. And I would point the Court to the 

supplemental excerpt of records at 504 where when GEICO 

implemented the policy that we're talking about here, 

the -- they said that the intent was that we would send 

to the people who were supposed to get the adverse 

action notice. With the early systems development we 

didn't have the ability to identify whether they were 

supposed to receive the notice or not; that was because 

they had not yet developed the way to do with what they 

call the neutral, where they compare how the applicant

would have done if they hadn't taken credit, hadn't 

taken credit into account at all. And this is a 

procedure that's required actually in most States in 

order to ensure that those who don't want to allow 

access to credit reports or who don't have a sufficient 

credit history are not treated adversely in the meaning 

of those State laws, and that means worse than the 

average loss ratio. So there's nothing in this record, 

even if you take into account the documents they're 

talking about, to suggest that there was somehow a 

knowing or deliberate intent to try to violate the law.

 With respect to a few of the factual or --

issues that came up, Safeco estimates that approximately 

80 percent of all consumers that they are selling new 

insurance to now have to get notice under the standards 

established by the Ninth Circuit.

 With respect to who can qualify for the top 

tier of credit, it's only, at least at GEICO, 

approximately 10 percent. So 90 percent of the 

consumers would not qualify for that.

 And the statute very plainly does not 

prohibit differential treatment based on persons with 

better credit, nor do State laws. And so the analogy as 

to race discrimination simply don't hold water, because 

there Congress has told you what the baseline is, you

can't treat any person of a different race in a 

different way, and that's not true under this statute. 

And instead, it's quite reasonable, as GEICO has 

concluded, to simply say look, if we wouldn't -- if 

we're treating you worse than we would have treated you 

if we ever looked at your credit report, worse than if 

you had an average loss ratio for this criteria, we'll 

send you the notice.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why did they use credit 

reports? Is it just a hedge against late premiums and 

the cost of late premiums, or does it bear on risk 

factors generally?

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, generally there are 

about 15 factors that they look at to try to come up 

with a prediction of loss ratio, and someone who has a 

good credit history is generally regarded as 

responsible, and responsible people tend to make less 

claims. And so, again, it's just one factor of 15 

though.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah. May I ask this 

question? The reading of the statute in subsection i 

about, in the charges for insurance advice, seems to 

favor your view. But subsection ii about denial of 

employment really seems to read in favor of the 

government's reading.

MS. MAHONEY: Well actually, I think that 

when you factor in employment, it has -- it has the 

opposite effect. Because what happens here is if you're 

using employment verification reports, consumer reports 

about employment, there are all kinds of consumer 

reports. How do you tell who had the optimal employment 

history? How could the baseline be the best employment 

history possible?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. But my point is, it 

seems to me that getting a lesser salary, it just seems 

like the first applicant would be an adverse employment 

action under subparagraph ii, just -- do you see what 

I'm trying to say?

 MS. MAHONEY: That if you -- that in other 

words, if you gave someone a lower salary --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It adversely affects any 

current or prospective employee. Now the language in i 

isn't, it doesn't read that way. But the thing that's 

troubling me is whether you should interpret i in the 

light of what ii seems to say.

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think that if 

GEICO in this example, if you actually pay them less 

because you looked at their credit report, then GEICO 

would concede that that is in fact an adverse action. 

So I don't think it's inconsistent at all.
