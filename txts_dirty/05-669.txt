 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument in BP 

America Production Company against the Secretary.

 Mr. Lamken.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. LAMKEN: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may 

it please the Court:

 Section 2415(a) established a limitations period 

for every action for money damages by the Government which 

is founded on any contract. That provision, by its terms, 

applies to every contract action, every adversary 

adjudication seeking monetary compensation for breach, 

whether pursued before a court or an agency.

 The contention that every action encompasses 

only civil actions or judicial actions is incorrect for 

three reasons. First, it is inconsistent with the broad 

language that Congress used. It is inconsistent with the 

statutory structure, in that it renders another provision, 

the exception for administrative offset, totally 

superfluous. It also creates an irrationality in the 

hierarchy of the Government's claims. Finally, it robs 

Section 2415(a) of its intended effect.

 Turning to the text, Congress

and agencies regularly use the term "action" to refer to 

adversary adjudications before administrative agencies and 

before the judiciary. The term --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What --

MR. LAMKEN: -- denotes --

JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you, on that point --

I understand what you're saying, and I've looked at your 

authority, but, right in the provision itself, there is a 

verbal distinction made between actions for money damages, 

and what, at the end of the provision, they refer to as 

"administrative proceedings" in providing for the 1-year 

supplementary rule. Doesn't the statute, in effect, say, 

"We don't mean, by 'action,' what we would possibly --

what possibly might be included as an administrative 

proceeding"? If they had wanted an administrative 

proceeding to be a subset of the actions for money 

damages, wouldn't it have been sensible for Congress to 

say in -- to refer, instead of to "administrative 

proceedings," to "administrative actions"?

 MR. LAMKEN: Well, in fact, the -- it refers to 

"administrative proceedings required by contract or law." 

And that clause applies in the particular circumstance 

where a law or a contract requires some sort of 

administrative proceeding as a condition precedent to the 

action for money damages. So, if you can bring your

money-damages action without any prior administrative 

proceeding, regardless of where you bring --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think your point has to be 

that there are administrative proceedings that are not 

actions.

 MR. LAMKEN: That is absolutely correct. 

Nonadversarial administrative proceedings would, 

themselves, not be actions.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. LAMKEN: And they also wouldn't be money-

damages actions. So, the distinction the statute draws is 

not between money-damages actions in court and money-

damages actions before agencies; it's before money-damages 

actions, wherever brought, and the administrative 

proceedings that have to be brought as a condition 

precedent.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You contend that what commenced 

the action here was the order demanding payment.

 MR. LAMKEN: That is correct. That is the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a very weird 

commencement of an action, where what then follows is what 

is referred to as an "appeal," within the agency.

 MR. LAMKEN: For historical reasons, the 

denominations are quite strange, but for Grisa, quoted --

on subsections 1702 and 1724, quoted on pages 5 and 6 of

our reply brief, specifically state that the order to pay 

commences the proceedings. And so, since that is the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which says that?

 MR. LAMKEN: It's on page 5-6 of our brief. 

It's Section 1702 of our --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What page of your brief?

 MR. LAMKEN: 5 and 6 of the reply brief.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of the reply.

 MR. LAMKEN: Yes. And it's 13 U.S.C. 1724, and 

it talks -- or it defines the "demand" as the order to 

pay. And then, the definitional provisions, in turn --

when they're talking about what commences the action, it 

says that the order to pay "commences" the action. And so 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not finding it. Where is 

it, again?

 MR. LAMKEN: Page 6 of the reply, Your Honor, 

very top. The citation says "13 U.S.C. 1724(b), emphasis 

added." It defines "demand" to include an order to pay 

issued by the Secretary. And, in the next line down, we 

say, "For Grisa thus recognizes that the so-call order to 

pay, far from concluding the action, in fact, commences 

it," because the statute of limitations prepared -- uses 

the word "commenced" to describe what the action -- the 

order to pay does.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is -- why doesn't it make 

much more sense -- as I understand the proceeding, this 

order doesn't come out of the blue. As required, there 

has to be a letter to the -- to the payee saying, "We 

think -- we think you owe so much money." He is allowed 

to respond, right? 

MR. LAMKEN: That --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And then, after considering the 

response, the order issues. Now, I would consider that a 

-- you know, an -- that sounds to me like a complaint and 

an opportunity to respond to it. And then, finally, the 

first decision of the agency, which is then appealed --

and CFR provides for an -- what he calls an appeal. And 

it seems to me the final opinion of the agency is the 

opinion on the appeal.

 MR. LAMKEN: In fact, that process, which isn't 

even mentioned in the regulations, doesn't have any legal 

operative effect. It's more like a demand letter. If the 

lessee doesn't respond to the letter, he doesn't waive any 

of his rights. If the Government fails to include a claim 

in its demand letter, in the -- well, in the audit letter 

-- it doesn't waive any of its rights. The --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it doesn't --

MR. LAMKEN: -- first document --

the order without having issued the letter first, giving --

MR. LAMKEN: I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- giving the party an 

opportunity to say why this amount isn't owed.

 MR. LAMKEN: Well, in fact, there's nothing in 

the regulations -- and I think the Solicitor General would 

concede -- that actually requires this informal process. 

It happens to be typically done. And the SG uses the word 

"typically" in the brief. But there's nothing that 

requires it. And if you don't respond, there are no 

consequences to failure to respond.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there anything that requires 

the order?

 MR. LAMKEN: The -- anything that requires the 

Secretary to proceed by order?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. LAMKEN: That is the Secretary's traditional 

way of doing things --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --

MR. LAMKEN: -- yes, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you could say the same for 

the other.

 MR. LAMKEN: Oh, but it -- but there is no 

liability if the order fails to issue. The order, if it 

were the first salvo, you still would be required to

respond. And so, your failure to respond is very much a 

default. The failure to respond to the letter, the audit 

letter, has no legal operative effect --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't -- you don't -- but 

you don't respond to the order; you take an appeal from 

the order.

 MR. LAMKEN: That's correct. You file a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me crazy to call 

that order a complaint. I -- even if I grant your other 

argument, that an administrative proceeding can be 

commenced by a complaint -- or that the term "complaint" 

can apply to administrative proceedings, I don't think 

that what you've hung your hat on here -- namely, the 

order -- seems to me to fit that description.

 MR. LAMKEN: Well, Justice Scalia, it is the 

first document, which is recognized in the regulations, 

which provides the lessor of the notice of claims against 

it, the first one that's required by the regulations in 

order to commence the proceedings.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You mean --

MR. LAMKEN: It's recognized --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the regulations don't refer 

to the initial letter?

 MR. LAMKEN: No. They don't -- the regulations 

don't require this informal process. It's typically done

JUSTICE SOUTER: So, they literally could start, 

absolutely out of the blue, by issuing the order?

 MR. LAMKEN: I think that's correct. That is 

the way that it could be done. There's an informal 

process that's typically followed; but you could ignore 

it, and there's no legal operative effect. So, that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I doubt whether --

MR. LAMKEN: -- informal process --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that would --

MR. LAMKEN: -- can't be a complaint.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I doubt whether that would 

conform with the Administrative Procedure Act. I mean, 

either -- even at the first level of agency decision --

MR. LAMKEN: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it seems to me you have to 

give the individual an opportunity to reply.

 MR. LAMKEN: Well, that is perhaps why the 

agency tries this -- to do the informal process. But, in 

fact, it does not have legal operative effect. There --

you could completely ignore that initial demand letter, 

and say, "Sorry, Agency, I'm not responding." The agency 

then files its order. And that's the first time you must 

register your defenses, upon failure or forfeiture --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course you can ignore it.

That doesn't prove anything. You could ignore an agency

MR. LAMKEN: Right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I mean, a formal complaint, 

in which case you'll be found liable. What does --

MR. LAMKEN: That's the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the fact that you don't have 

to respond have to do with anything?

 MR. LAMKEN: The legal consequences. It's 

exactly right, Justice Scalia. If you don't respond to 

the demand letter, there are no legal consequences. If 

you don't respond to the letter by filing what's called an 

"appeal," you lose. And so, it's just like a complaint; 

you default if you fail to raise your defenses at that 

point. In addition, Section 2415 --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And it's also, I assume, true 

that the demand letter would not toll a statute.

 MR. LAMKEN: No, we don't believe a demand 

letter would toll a statute, because it's not required by 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you --

MR. LAMKEN: -- by law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you'd win in this case even 

if it did. I don't think that the difference between the 

initial letter giving you an opportunity to reply, and the

-- what you call the "complaint," the order -- that time 

period doesn't put you out of -- out of the permissible 

period.

 MR. LAMKEN: Oh, I certainly hope --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. LAMKEN: -- hope not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. LAMKEN: But, in fact, Section 2415(f), 

which is on page 4 and 5 of the appendix to our brief, 

makes it clear that whether something is denominated a 

complaint or not does not determine whether or not it's 

covered by the limitations period. 2415(f) is an 

exception for counterclaims and offsets by the Government 

where a private party brings an action against the 

Government. But counterclaims and offsets typically 

aren't brought by complaint; they're brought in the 

answer, they're submitted in the answer. Therefore, 

whether it's denominated an "order," an "answer," or 

something else, doesn't control whether or not 2415 

applies. 2415 applies to any action for money damages 

founded on a contract, however you might denominate the 

initial filing which commences the proceedings. In --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Lamken, the point has 

been made that there are many indications that what 

Congress had in mind was ordinary civil action in a court.

In addition to finding this provision solely in title 28, 

the judiciary code, and not in title 5, there's also, if 

you read the following provision, 2416, time for 

commencing actions brought by the United States. And then 

it tells us the tolling periods. And, in doing that, it 

refers twice to the "defendant," which is a term that's 

used in civil proceedings, not administrative proceedings.

 MR. LAMKEN: Well, starting at 28 U.S.C., why 

it's there, it, in fact, applies both to administrative 

agency actions and actions in courts. And sometimes in 28 

U.S.C. there are provisions that apply to both. The 

Federal Tort Claims Act, for example, is in 28 U.S.C., and 

it has a provision for administrative adjustment of claims. 

People must file their claims before an agency first, and 

then the agency can do administrative adjustment. That's 

entirely separate from the attorney general's ability to 

compromise the claim once it's filed in court.

 Section -- title 5 also contains things that 

apply to courts and agencies -- the right to judicial 

review of agency actions, the waiver of immunity that's 

necessary for those -- in addition to standards that 

govern judicial review of agency actions. Those were all 

in title 5, but they actually apply to courts. These --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, 2415(a), (i), we -- you, 

you cannot possibly say that that only applies to judicial

actions, can you?

 MR. LAMKEN: Oh, no. That's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MR. LAMKEN: -- actually completely --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's in --

MR. LAMKEN: -- superfluous.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and that's in title 28.

 MR. LAMKEN: And that's in -- yes, that's in 

title 28, as well.

 And with respect to the term "defendants," 

Justice Ginsburg, Congress has often used the term 

"defendants" even in the context of administrative 

actions. The Stockyard and Packers Act of 1921 -- it's in 

7 U.S.C. 210 -- actually talks about a complaint against a 

defendant for damages, all adjudicated before the 

Secretary of Agriculture, and that was 85 years ago. It 

seems a little late in the day now to debate whether one 

can be a defendant, the person who defends before an 

agency, as well as the defendant --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not the typical term 

used in agency proceedings to designate the responding 

party.

 MR. LAMKEN: Well, you can talk about the 

"responding party," or the "defendant," but the term 

"defendant" is sufficiently broad to include one who

defends or denies, and that would be a term -- and it's 

been used in the past, as long as 85 years ago -- to 

discuss the person who might be liable for damages in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the content --

MR. LAMKEN: -- an adversary --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the content of the tolling 

provision, as well, seems geared -- seems geared to a 

civil lawsuit. It talks about a person being outside the 

United States; therefore, they wouldn't be amenable to 

service of process.

 MR. LAMKEN: That's certainly right. These are 

all things that would apply, we would expect, both to 

a civil action in court and an administrative-agency 

action, as well. They may work better for one or 

the other in different particular circumstances, but they 

are all sufficiently broad that they can be used in both 

circumstances. And the one the Government, in the 

administrative context, would be most interested in would 

be subsection C. When the Government just doesn't know 

the facts, or the Government reasonably couldn't know the 

facts, it gets an exception, just tolling, until it 

reasonably could have known of the fact. And that's just 

as applicable in an action before an agency as it would be 

in an action before a court.

 In addition, the Government's contrary

construction renders an entire provision superfluous. And 

that is the one that Justice Scalia mentioned, Section 

2415(i), which is an exception for administrative offsets. 

That exception for administrative offsets would do no work 

at all if --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That wasn't part of the 

original statute, was it?

 MR. LAMKEN: No, that was added about 16 years 

later, Your Honor. And it was added, but it clarifies the 

scope of the statute. And, as this Court admitted in --

pointed out in cases like Fausto and LaFranca, the later 

amendment to a statute can clarify its meaning; and, 

indeed, statutes are ordinarily read, once amended, as if 

they existed in their amended form from the offset.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that (i) was added 

because it's -- for a very specific reason, that there was 

a debate between the Department of Justice and -- I forgot 

the other agency --

MR. LAMKEN: The Comptroller, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- yes -- about whether an 

offset would be subject to the time limit.

 MR. LAMKEN: That's exactly right. And Congress 

resolved that debate by providing an exception for 

administrative offsets, and no other exception for any --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What --

MR. LAMKEN: -- sort of administrative 

proceeding. And that raises the strong inference that, in 

fact, this applies to administrative proceedings, and it 

simply doesn't apply to administrative offsets, because 

they're an exception.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They could have said -- if the 

other interpretation of 2415(a), as not applying to 

administrative proceedings, were correct, they could have 

said the provisions of this section do not apply to 

administrative proceedings --

MR. LAMKEN: That's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- which would have -- which 

would have handled the offset --

MR. LAMKEN: Yes. It would have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- but would have been well 

beyond the offset. And the fact --

MR. LAMKEN: That's exactly right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that they only focus on the 

offset certainly suggests that when you're not talking 

about offset, it does apply to administrative proceedings.

 MR. LAMKEN: I could not have said it better, 

and I will not attempt to. In fact, in addition, it 

raises another anomaly in the statute, the Government's 

contrary construction. And that is, it creates sort of an

irrationality in the hierarchy of claims for the 

Government. Offensive judicial actions to extract money 

from private individuals must be brought within 6 years. 

Administrative offsets for the Government to try and avoid 

paying money, those must be brought within 10 years, under 

the administrative offset provision that was enacted 

together with the exception in (i). However, offensive 

administrative actions to extract money may be brought in 

perpetuity, forever. It simply strains credulity to 

believe that Congress, at the same time it was saying the 

Government has only 10 years to assert administrative 

offsets to avoid paying money, instead intended

where there is a sensible hierarchy of claims, or a 

sensible hierarchy of preferences. The Court doesn't 

ordinarily presume that Congress put in a structure that 

doesn't respect that ordinary hierarchy. And the 

Government's construction here is inconsistent with the 

ordinary hierarchy which allows the Government to avoid 

making payment on more favorable terms; then the 

Government gets to go in and forcibly extract money from 

private individuals.

 Finally, the Government's construction also 

undermines the intended effect of the statute. The effect 

of statute -- the purpose of statutes of limitations --

and this one, in particular -- is to provide repose -- to 

allow the individual to know that he will no longer 

confront Government claims, to dispose of his documents, 

and also to encourage the Government to be diligent in 

pursuing its claims. None of those purposes are achieved, 

all of those purposes are defeated, if -- once the statute 

of limitations period expires --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Lamken --

MR. LAMKEN: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- could we go back to Section 

(i) for a second more? Is it also possible to say that 

there was this disagreement between the Department of 

Justice and the Comptroller General, and Congress decided

that the Comptroller General was right? And, if that's 

true, should we not accept the Comptroller General's 

reading of the entire statute?

 MR. LAMKEN: Well, if Congress had decided the 

Comptroller General is right, and had done that in 

subsection (i), it would have written subsection (i) the 

way Justice Scalia proposed, which is to say this doesn't 

apply to administrative claims at all. What it did is, it 

said, "Ooh, this appears to apply to administrative claims 

and the Comptroller thinks these administrative offsets are 

important, so we will give a special statute of 

limitations period in 31 U.S.C. for those, and exempt them 

from the more general statute of limitations period in 

section 28 U.S.C. 2415." So, I don't believe that it 

should be read that way. Is it frivolous to suggest that 

that's the reading? No, the Government --

stepped into the fray and created an exception. But it 

created a limited exception --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.

 MR. LAMKEN: -- an exception that applies only 

to one context, and that's administrative offsets. And 

that certainly raises a very strong inference that, where 

there isn't such an exception, the statute applies to 

administrative proceedings, more generally.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't the most likely answer 

that they just -- they saw a small problem, and they 

rendered a decision on the small problem, and they didn't 

think about it any further than that?

 MR. LAMKEN: Well, I have a hard time 

psychoanalyzing Congress, because it's sort of a corporate 

body, and I can't tell what Member of Member of Congress 

is saying what. But when the Court of these statutes, it 

generally reads them -- and it, in fact, avoids, whenever 

possible, superfluity. And if this provision applies to 

administrative proceedings from the outset, subsection (i) 

is superfluous, it's -- does no work whatsoever. And so, 

the -- when Congress amended this statute, it certainly 

clarified that, where there is no exception, this statute 

applies to actions filed in administrative proceedings.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. JOSEFFER: Justice Stevens, and may it 

please the Court:

 The presumption is that the Government is not 

bound by a statute of limitations. And, when read as a 

whole, Section 2415(a) does not overcome that presumption, 

but instead makes clear that it applies only to suits in 

court. There are several reasons for that. First, the 

ordinary meanings of all of the key statutory terms refer 

to suits in court. Second, the statute expressly 

distinguishes between administrative proceedings and 

actions. Third the statute's located in the judicial 

code. Fourth, the committee reports, for those who are 

inclined to consider them, strongly support the statute's 

ordinary meaning. And, fifth, even if some administrative 

proceedings were governed by Section 2415(a), these would 

not, because they do not involve a complaint.

 Now, on the first of those points, the term 

"action" ordinarily refers to the pursuit of a right in 

court, which just is why, just 7 years ago, in West v.

Gibson, every member of this Court agreed that the term 

"action" often refers only to suits in court, and not to 

administrative proceedings.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It often does. It often does. 

But it does not, universally. And there are a number of 

instances cited by the Petitioner that -- where this Court 

and -- and statutes use the term in context where it 

clearly applies to administrative proceedings.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, the question is, How -- you 

know, how absurd is it not to read it to apply to 

administrative proceedings in this case? And I find it 

pretty absurd, because you assume, if you read that it 

way, that there is effectively no statute of limitations 

whatever for the Government in these cases.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, the structure of the law 

here is that in those instances where Congress does 

authorize administrative recovery, it ordinarily provides 

a context-specific administrative limitations period, such 

as in the Contract Disputes Act, which governs almost all 

of the contract claims the Government can pursue 

administratively. Congress specifically enacted a 6-year 

limitations period for the submission of a claim to a 

contracting officer. 

In this unique context, however, Congress had

very good reasons for not applying a limitations period 

until it prospectively enacted a partial one in 1996. The 

reason is that what Congress found here, in context of 

mineral leasing, based on the findings of an independent 

commission, was that the companies were historically on an 

honors system and had abused that by underpaying royalties 

of up to half a billion dollars annually. So, what 

Congress directed the agency to do is to audit all current 

and past lease accounts. One of the committee reports 

said to focus on old accounts, because this was a Congress 

that was not concerned with repose, but with getting some 

of those vast underpayments back from the companies.

 Now, when we fast-forward to 1996 --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait.

 MR. JOSEFFER: -- at that point --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. And this was the 

Congress that enacted what?

 MR. JOSEFFER: No, I -- agreed. What I'm 

referring to now is the Congress that enacted the mineral 

leasing provisions.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh.

 MR. JOSEFFER: -- which is not a good --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is not what we're talking 

about here.

 MR. JOSEFFER: No, but -- well, we are, because

the structure of the law here is that Section 2415(a), as 

we see it, governs court suits. And that works, because, 

when Congress authorizes administrative recovery, it 

almost always provides a specific -- context-specific 

administrative limitations period.

 Also, when Congress was telling the agency to 

focus on old accounts, it certainly wasn't thinking that a 

statute of limitations applied to that, and the agency, in 

that contemporary context, did not understand that there 

was a limitations period, either, because the orders that 

issued in the aftermath of the 1982 Act went back 7, 8, 9, 

sometimes more, years than that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: As late as 1978, the Justice 

Department didn't think that way, did it?

 MR. JOSEFFER: No, the Justice Department--

JUSTICE SCALIA: The opinion of the Office of 

Legal Counsel, in '78, was exactly what the Petitioner 

here would urge.

 MR. JOSEFFER: No, the OLC opinion was limited, 

by both its terms and its reasoning, to administrative 

offsets, not to administrative adjudications. And if I 

could explain that, an administrative offset occurs in the 

situation -- this is what OLC was looking at -- where the 

Government, by statute, owed retirement benefits to a 

person, and, because it thought that person owed it money,

what the Government did was to unilaterally reduce the 

retirement benefits. What OLC opined is that that is a --

nothing more than a prejudgment attachment. And OLC 

thought that if the Government is time-barred from 

obtaining a judgment, it should be time-barred from 

obtaining a prejudgment attachment.

 An administrative adjudication is significantly 

different, because it does provide an actual judgment. 

So, there are a couple of important points from that.

 First is that the dispute between OLC and the 

Comptroller General was limited by its terms to 

administrative offsets, although, Justice Stevens, the 

Comptroller General did opine beyond that, that the 

statute specifically applies only to suits in court. But 

the actual dispute was as to administrative offsets. So, 

when Congress addressed that specific dispute, as Justice 

Alito pointed out, it resolved only that specific dispute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- excuse me -- how could 

OLC possibly think that it applied to administrative 

offsets if it didn't apply to administrative proceedings? 

I mean, it was a contradiction of the proposition, which 

you're urging here, which is that this statute applies 

only to judicial proceedings. I mean, that's the point. 

Whether they spoke just to offsets or not, the position 

taken by the Justice Department was that this statute

relates to administrative proceedings.

 MR. JOSEFFER: No, the position of OLC was 

limited to administrative offsets, and it did not -- the 

important thing is, OLC opinion did not interpret the 

statutory term "action," or, frankly, any other statutory 

term. Instead, it had a theory, which was probably wrong, 

that administrative offsets are unique because they are 

prejudgment attachment devices. That's the dispute that 

went to Congress, and that's the dispute that Congress 

actually resolved.

 And, in any event, going forward --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, on that theory, then, 

there was -- there was no time issue with respect to the 

right to offset, then, in the OLC's position.

 MR. JOSEFFER: No, the OLC's view is that if the 

Government was time-barred from obtaining a judgment under 

Section 2415(a), then it would be time-barred from 

obtaining a prejudgment attachment.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I thought your -- in 

answer to Justice Scalia, you said what was essential to 

the -- to OLC's position was that the offset is like a 

prejudgment attachment, and, in effect, it's an attachment 

without process. If that's the case, then timing should 

have nothing to do with it. Conversely, as Justice Scalia 

said, if timing does have something to do with it, timing

presumably derives from this provision; this provision, 

therefore, must have been assumed to apply to 

administrative proceedings.

 So, either there's no time question with respect 

to the offsets, or, if there is a time question with 

respect to the offsets, it implies an OLC position that 

this provision applies to administrative proceedings.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What's wrong with that logic?

 MR. JOSEFFER: I think what's wrong with the 

logic is what was wrong with the logic of the OLC opinion. 

We don't mean to defend the --

MR. JOSEFFER: -- reasoning of the OLC opinion --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- in good company, but --

MR. JOSEFFER: -- but what OLC really did say --

and Comptroller General and Congress promptly disagreed --

was that -- it didn't see a problem -- OLC didn't see a 

problem with procedurally imposing an administrative 

offset. What it saw a problem with was, it thought if an 

-- a judgment would be time-barred, then a prejudgment 

attachment should be time-barred, as well. I mean, that 

was the reasoning of the --

point. The OLC opinion was -- arose in the context where 

a judgment could be obtained at all only in court.

afternoon.

 MR. JOSEFFER: The point's just -- the OLC 

reasoning was admittedly somewhat odd, but that was the 

context in which Congress was responding to. And, going 

forward, it is not surplusage, because the issue still

arises. If the Government could pursue its suit only in 

court, it would be time-barred from pursuing a suit in 

court. The question would then still arise, under the OLC 

opinion, unless it had been overruled, whether the 

Government could, nonetheless, obtain a prejudgment 

attachment, even though it cannot obtain judgment. That's 

all that Congress was looking at there. And, as this 

Court's recognized in cases like O'Gilvie and Vonn, when 

Congress amends a statue to resolve a specific dispute, 

oftentimes its amendments should be read as doing no more 

than that.

 We -- I agree, though, that terms -- to get back 

to the beginning of this discussion -- terms do not always 

have their ordinary meanings, but they presumptively do, 

especially when a statute must be strictly construed. And 

here, the context confirms that "action" does have its 

ordinary meaning, for several reasons.

 First, the ordinary meanings of the other key 

statutory terms, such as "right of action," "complaint," 

and "defendant," as Justice Ginsberg pointed out, all 

ordinarily refer to aspects of suits in court. A "right 

of action" is the right to bring a suit in court; a 

"defendant" is the person defending in court ordinarily; 

and a "complaint" is the document that initiates 

proceedings by stating a claim that's seeking relief in a

civil action, which is a suit in court. Especially when 

those terms are used together, this Court recognized, in 

Unexcelled Chemical, that a reference to commencing a 

action by filing a complaint ordinarily refers to filing a 

suit in court, not a pleading before an administrative 

agency. The statute then goes on to expressly juxtapose 

an action against an administrative proceeding by saying 

that the time to file an action does not run until after 

the administrative proceedings have concluded, which 

certainly gives weight to the point that the action is --

an administrative proceeding is not an action.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Would the -- at the time that 

4515 -- is that the --

MR. JOSEFFER: It's 2415.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: 20- -- I'm sorry. At the time 

that was enacted, were there any limitations in other 

statutes on the commencement of administrative 

proceedings?

 MR. JOSEFFER: The ones that we have found were 

-- I'm not 100-percent sure, but the ones that we -- that 

we have found and cited in our brief do appear to be 

enacted after that time. I think the reason is that -- I 

mean, historically, administrative -- obviously, court 

suits have been around a lot longer than administrative 

adjudications. And, as Congress has authorized

administrative adjudications, it's dealt with them on a 

case-by-case basis. And every time that it enacted a 

context-specific administrative adjudications period since 

1966 -- in theory, it could have just done an 

across-the-board one for all agency adjudications, but, 

instead, it's chosen to deal with the context-specific; in 

part, because of the great variety of administrative 

procedure. 

I mean, as this case illustrates, a statute of 

limitations that governs a complaint in an action is just 

not going to work in a lot of administrative contexts. 

Here, there's no complaint. An "order" is a legally 

binding order. It doesn't seek relief, it imposes it. 

And unless it is both appealed and stayed pending appeal 

JUSTICE SCALIA: How about the initial letter 

that, in the agency practice, precedes the order? I 

gather there's a letter to the --

MR. JOSEFFER: Right. There's -- there are 

basically three steps here. First, there's an audit. 

Then, if the audit reveals an apparent discrepancy, the 

agency or a State with delegate authority would send an 

issue letter requesting an explanation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: An issue letter.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Yes. It's called an "issue

letter." And then would basically request an explanation 

of the apparent discrepancy. And then, if the agency then 

decides, after consideration of the audit and the issue 

letter, that it's appropriate to issue an order to pay it, 

will do so. It --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sounds to me like a complaint, 

a response --

MR. JOSEFFER: An issue letter?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and an adjudication. I 

mean, you know --

MR. JOSEFFER: I don't know whether you mean the 

audit --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- "We think you owe this."

 MR. JOSEFFER: -- or the issue letter, but 

either way --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The response comes back, "I 

don't think we owe it, and here's why." And then there's 

a ruling, "You do owe it." And that's the order. And 

then you can appeal it. And the CFR refers to it as an 

appeal.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Yes. Well, there are a few 

things. First, on the -- with respect to the issue letter 

-- I mean, a complaint, functionally, is a document that 

initiates proceedings, stating it -- by stating the claim 

for relief, is seeking relief in a civil action. With

respect to the second of those, an issue letter does not 

-- is not an allegation of wrongdoing, and it does not 

seek relief; it seeks information so that the agency can 

determine whether or not an apparent discrepancy raised by 

an audit is, in fact, a discrepancy. But there's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It does not --

MR. JOSEFFER: -- no claim.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- assert that there's a 

discrepancy?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, what it -- what it asserts 

is that, "We've done an audit, and the audit has raised 

the following issues" -- that's why it's called an "issue 

letter" -- "Please provide an explanation." And it -- so, 

at that point, the agency has not decided yet whether it 

is, in fact, asserting a claim. It's not -- and it's not 

requesting relief, which a complaint definitely does. All 

it's requesting is information to help the agency assess 

the issue.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have an example of issue 

letters anywhere? That's not in the materials either, is 

it? In the --

 JUSTICE STEVENS: There would be some in dispute.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Going forward, if we --

MR. JOSEFFER: But --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- if we agree with your 

position, the result will be that there will be a 7-year 

limitations period for oil and gas leases, but, for Indian 

claims and for minerals, there'll be no statute of 

limitations?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Yes, and the reason is that 

that's what Congress chose to do. I mean, in the 

prospective 1996 Act, it --

JUSTICE ALITO: Did they --

MR. JOSEFFER: -- enacted the limitations --

JUSTICE ALITO: When they enacted the 7-year 

limitation period, did they explain why they would treat 

those two situations so differently?

 MR. JOSEFFER: No, there's no explanation. As a 

practical matter, though, the prospective 1996 legislation 

governs a wide variety of aspects of the -- of the 

relationship between the Federal Government and the 

lessees. And, on balance, that package was pretty 

favorable to the oil companies, and I think Congress

but not to the Indians.

 Getting back to the order, though, it's not only 

that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you defend against a 

claim for, you know, stuff that went on a hundred years 

ago?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, as a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I'm really very reluctant 

to -- unless there is no possible other reading of the 

statute, to think that that's -- that that's what the law 

provides, that the Government can show up a hundred years 

later, and say, "Oh, by the way, you owe all this money." 

MR. JOSEFFER: Well, first off, until --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The company says "Gee, I -- you 

know, I don't have records from a hundred years ago."

 MR. JOSEFFER: Right. Well, there are a few 

points, both legal and practical. On the legal, until 

1966 that absolutely was the law, because historically no 

limitations period ever applies against the Government. 

And that's the reason for the strict construction canon, 

that the statute applies here only if it clearly applies, 

and thereby bars the Government from forcing the law in 

the public interest.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Say that again. Until 1966,

there were no statute of limitations against any 

Government suits?

 MR. JOSEFFER: Not contract. I mean, the 

historic rule is that the Government is not bound by 

statutes of limitations, because what it's doing is 

enforcing the law in the public interest. Now, in 1966, 

Congress enacted Section 2415(a) so that there would 

prospectively be a contract limitations period. But it's 

strictly construed, because of the historical backdrop and 

the importance of enforcing the law in the public 

interest. So that's why we do have a strict construction 

canon here. As a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He didn't apply against the 

Government either.

 MR. JOSEFFER: For the same reason laches is 

never applied against the Government.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, there's no limit at all, 

and you concede that that's the case. So, the Government 

could go back on these royalties as long as it likes.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, as an abstract theoretical 

matter, the Government could reach back many, many 

decades. As a practical matter, though, that's never 

happened that we've gone back, say, 50 or 100 years 

and there are practical reasons for that. First is that 

the agency does not have enough resources to audit --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, there's a case involving 

the Oneida Indians, that went back quite a ways --

MR. JOSEFFER: That's true. It's -- I meant in 

the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- 200 years --

MR. JOSEFFER: -- leasing context here.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 MR. JOSEFFER: I didn't mean in the leasing 

context here. But in the leasing context, one -- there 

are a couple of important points. One is that the 

Government does not have enough resources to audit all of 

the current accounts in all of the years, which is one of 

the reasons that we need to be able to go back farther 

when we catch the violation. As a -- but as 

a result, the notion that we're going to pull auditing 

resources off of today to do a frolicking detour into 50 

years ago, there's a reason that's never happened.

 In addition, the farther we try to go back, the 

greater the proof problems, because oftentimes only the 

companies have the information that shows what royalties 

they would owe, and if they lawfully destroy those records 

after 6 years, it makes it even harder for us to try to go 

back, because of proof problems.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's another indication. Why 

would you allow them to destroy those records after 6

years if you -- if you thought -- if you thought that 

there was no statute of limitations to claims for these 

things? I mean, that's just another inconsistency that --

in the statutory scheme that's created.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, no, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You say, "You can destroy your 

records after 6 years." Well, why? It doesn't make any 

sense.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Well, first, it's optional, not 

mandatory. If they want to keep them, they --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. JOSEFFER: -- certainly can. But there's no 

-- and, as a practical matter -- I mean, because the 

Government bears the initial burden of going forward, if 

the company destroys the sources of proof, that's, on 

balance, going to be in its favor. But, in addition, 

there's not a strict congruence between the 6-year 

periods, because, first, the companies only have to keep 

records for 6 years, but, in some circumstances, the 

Secretary can require they be kept for longer. In 

addition, sometimes the statute of limitations, because of 

tolling, is much longer than 6 years; and so, the lawful 

destruction of records would still leave absence-of-proof 

issues in situations where the statute might, because of 

tolling, be much longer. So, there's not a strict

congruence.

 There is also no indication that Congress 

enacted the 6-year records-retention policy because it was 

thinking about a 6-year limitations period. There's never 

been any linkage between the two.

 If I could briefly cover, then, also -- I mean, 

in addition to all the textual points, this is also 

located in the judicial code. And, although it's true 

that a couple stray provisions in the judicial code apply 

to administrative proceedings, they say that expressly. 

Every time the word "action" is used in the judicial code 

-- and Petitioners identified no examples -- every time 

the word "action" is used in the judicial code, it refers 

to a suit in court, and only a suit in court.

 When a provision of the judicial code applies to 

something else, it will say so. For example, 28 U.S. Code 

2462, which is a statute of limitations for penalty 

proceedings, refers to an "action, suit, or proceeding." 

The Federal Tort Claims Act is very clear that what 

it's talking about is submitting something to an agency.

 So, if Congress was going to legislate against 

the backdrop of a strict construction canon with terms 

that ordinarily refer to suits in court, and put the 

provision in the judicial code, I mean, that just is a 

totally irrational way of expressing intent, especially

clear -- especially a clear intent, when it's trying to 

govern administrative proceedings.

 The committee reports also strongly confirm 

that, because they not only say that the statute defines 

the time limitation for bringing an action in the U.S. 

courts, and not only use court terminology from front to 

back, they also say, like the statute, that they're aware 

of the administrative proceedings, but what they're saying 

is that the time to bring an action in the courts does not 

expire until after the conclusion of those proceedings.

 The committee has explained that the reason for 

that provision was the great number and variety of 

administrative proceedings. So, in other words, Congress 

was saying, "There's a great variety of administrative 

procedure. We're just not going to deal with that here. 

We're taking it off the table by saying this limitations 

period does not expire until a year after those 

administrative proceedings, whatever they might be, have 

expired."

 There's also some relevance in the fact that 

this legislation was proposed by the Justice Department as 

part of an overall package of reforms that would govern 

the civil litigation that the Department was handling in 

the courts. It was then referred to the Judiciary 

Committees, not to the House Government Reform Committees

that might consider administrative procedure matters, and, 

as I mentioned before, was enacted as part of the judicial 

code.

 From start to finish, this legislation has never 

had anything to do with anything other than court suits, 

which is why Congress has expressly provided for 

context-specific administrative systems -- limitations 

periods -- which make sense in the context of the relevant 

administrative procedures.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, except when you -- when 

you say "this legislation," you limit it to the body of 

2415(a) and you leave out (i), which -- -- or I guess it's 

"one." Is it? Little -- or --

MR. JOSEFFER: It's (i). It is (i). 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's (i). I mean, that clearly 

does apply to administrative proceedings. And I could 

understand the argument that Congress was just making 

things doubly clear -- okay? -- that (a) does not apply to 

administrative proceedings. I could understand that 

argument if the way (i) was written is, "The provisions of 

this section shall not apply to administrative 

proceedings." And then I would say, "You know, oh, well, 

that was always the case, and this is just making it 

clear."

 It doesn't say that. It says that -- the only

administrative proceeding that they cut out of it is these 

offsets.

 MR. JOSEFFER: I think the reason is that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And, you know, the normal rule 

is inclusio unius, exclusio alterius. I would -- it 

means, to me, when I read the statute as a whole -- and 

that's the way I read statutes, I don't ask whether this 

section was adopted this year, and the other section was 

adopted next year -- I don't do it bite by bite; you look 

at the whole text -- and, when you read all this stuff 

together, it seems to me that the import of (i) is that 

administrative proceedings, despite the fact that "action" 

is not a very common word to use for them, are covered.

 MR. JOSEFFER: I mean, it's -- there's no doubt 

the statute should be read as a whole. But, as this Court 

has explained in cases like the O'Gilvie and Vonn cases 

cited in our brief, when a court's trying to make sense of 

a statute read as a whole, oftentimes it will find that 

when Congress faces a specific dispute and amends a 

statute to resolve that specific dispute, that's all it 

resolves, and there's no reason to draw further negative 

inference, especially here, as the Court of Appeals 

pointed out, where a strict construction canon applies.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the best thing you have 

going for you, really, the strict construction canon.

MR. JOSEFFER: Well, because -- I mean, and it 

is an important point, that the statute applies only if it 

clearly applies by its terms. And it seems to me, the 

best that Petitioners can do is to say that some of the 

statutory terms, in isolation, are ambiguous. But that --

all that means, as I said, is that, under the strict 

construction canon, we would prevail. And even if the 

statute governs some administrative proceedings, but not 

others, it would not govern these, for the reason I gave 

earlier, which is that there's no complaint here. We 

talked, before, about the ways in which an order is not a 

complaint. It's another important point, though, that in 

order not only -- it is -- not only does it not begin the 

proceedings, it normally ends them, because appeals are 

only taken about a quarter of the time. And in some 

limited circumstances there's not even a right of appeal, 

if the Assistant Secretary issued the order. So --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What if I didn't think the 

order was a complaint, but I thought the initial letter 

was a complaint? Would the Petitioner lose? Because they 

never made that argument.

 MR. JOSEFFER: Correct. It's -- the only 

argument they've ever made --

complaint. So, they haven't preserved the point.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because you're --

MR. JOSEFFER: But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you made the point that 

the issue letter is just raising the issues, and it's not 

charging, as a complaint would allege, "You owe us," but 

this is, "Maybe you owe us."

 MR. JOSEFFER: Correct. There's no -- in an 

issue letter, there's no claim for relief, just a claim 

for the request for information, and there's no allegation 

of wrongdoing. So, it's just not a complaint in those 

ways. Also, it doesn't -- it's not really fair to say 

that it begins proceedings, because it comes between an 

audit and an order to pay. So it doesn't -- and plus, 

it's, of course, not filed in a civil action. And, in 

that respect, it doesn't satisfy any of the -- any of the 

elements of the -- of the ordinary definition of 

"complaints."

 JUSTICE ALITO: Are you saying that this doesn't 

apply to any administrative proceeding, or just those that 

are structured like this one, where you don't have 

anything that's labeled a "complaint"?

 MR. JOSEFFER: We -- well, our primary 

submission is that it does not apply to any administrative 

proceedings, for the reason -- reasons I've given, that

the ordinary meanings of all of the key statutory terms 

are for suits in court. A "complaint" itself is 

ordinarily defined to be --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Even if you have an 

administrative proceeding which is called a "complaint"? 

You know, I mean -- and some are, I think.

 MR. JOSEFFER: There are -- there are some 

contexts in administrative procedure in which the word 

"complaint" is used.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that would not be covered 

by 2415(a).

 MR. JOSEFFER: Because it's not filed in an 

"action," which refers to a suit in court, following 

occurral of a right of action, which refers to the right 

to bring suit in court, in a statute which then juxtaposes 

the terms "action" against "administrative proceedings" --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And let's assume all those 

terms are used in the agency procedure. They're talking 

about "action," "right of action." All those terms are 

used in the agency's procedural rules. Would they then 

come under this thing?

be up to the agency, just by renaming their things, to 

come in or out, right? 

MR. JOSEFFER: Well, and it's a much more --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. JOSEFFER: -- fundamental point than that, 

too, is that what Congress was doing here was, when using 

these terms in their ordinary sense, to lay out an across-

the-board rule that applies to suits in court.

 And, finally, one thing I should also emphasize 

is that what we have in this context is a comprehensive 

administrative scheme. Petitioners like to say that, 

"Well, we could just as easily be in court." There's a 

reason that no administrative royalty proceeding has ever 

been brought by the Government in a court. And that's, 

first, that Congress directed the agency to establish a 

comprehensive auditing and collection system, and then 

gave the agency administrative authority to enforce its 

administrative orders. The only way the agency could 

administer thousands of leases with something like $9 

billion in royalties every year is to do this in an 

efficient administrative manner.

 Congress has not only authorized that, and 

ratified it, it has strengthened that scheme and told the 

agency, as I said, in 1982, to go back and look at old 

leases, precisely because Congress knew that is a

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. LAMKEN: I will endeavor not to. Thank you, 

Justice Stevens.

 I wanted to start with the ordinary meaning of 

the term "action." I was somewhat bemused by the 

Government's insistence that had -- the term "action" in 

West versus Gibson was construed -- it must mean an action 

before a court, and has that as its ordinary meaning.

 The Solicitor General's own position in West 

versus Gibson, on page 25 and -6 of its brief was, 

"Section 1981(a) does not, however, define the term 

'action' as being limited to judicial proceedings. The 

statutory language, read in context, suggests that no such 

limitation was intended."

 Page 6 of the Government's reply, "The term 

'action,' in Section 1981, can reasonably be construed as

encompassing both administrative and judicial 

proceedings."

 The term "action" is a term that's used for 

adversary adjudicative proceedings, whether those are in 

court or before an agency. It is not limited to 

administrative agency proceedings, as the Government 

itself recognized in West versus Gibson.

 There are more general terms here. There's also 

"complaint," there's also "defendant." There's a number 

of those. But those general terms are also the terms of 

adversary adjudication. And Congress uses them, as far 

back as 1921, for adversary adjudications before agencies.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Lamken, have you had any 

second thoughts about your position that it's the order, 

rather than the issue letter, that we should look at?

 MR. LAMKEN: Well, in fact -- no. But the --

the answer is that we didn't -- no issue was engaged as to 

what was the functional equivalent of the complaint below. 

That raised -- was raised for the first time by the 

Solicitor General in its merits brief, saying, "No, no, 

no, there's actually some stuff that comes before the 

order."

 But if -- I would encourage the Court to look at 

the definitions in FOGRSFA, 1724 and 1702(A), which tell 

you what, under -- in Congress's view, commences the

proceedings here. And, in Congress's view, what commences 

the proceedings, what triggers the new statute of 

limitations and stops it from running, is the order to 

pay, which Congress defines as a "demand."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's true. That's 

true. But the provision you're arguing that you come 

under does talk about a complaint.

 MR. LAMKEN: That's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's what -- you know, 

that's what starts the 6 years running. And it's -- seems 

to me odd to call something a "complaint" which is, in 

fact, an order. They're not complaining about anything; 

they're saying, "Pay the money."

 MR. LAMKEN: Actually, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, usually a complaint, 

you're -- you make your point, and say, "What do you say? 

What's your answer?"

 MR. LAMKEN: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And this is an order. "You're 

-- boom, "Pay."

 MR. LAMKEN: It certainly has a hybrid quality, 

Justice Scalia. And it's not a hybrid quality that the 

industry particularly likes. But it is the first time 

that the Government asserts its state -- its claims as to 

what's wrong, in a binding legally operative document,

where the failure to respond results in default. It has 

that function as complaint. It is the first salvo in 

official, formal administrative proceedings.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's only true if you 

consider an appeal to be the response. And that's rather 

weird, that --

MR. LAMKEN: It is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that the response to a 

complaint is an appeal.

 MR. LAMKEN: The language that has been used, 

and -- as a result of very odd historical anomalies and 

attempts to introduce a sense of due process to these 

proceedings over time -- is odd, and it is awkward. But 

it's clear that when Congress wrote the scope of this 

statute, it said it applies to "every action for money 

damages by the Government which is founded in contract." 

It doesn't say "actions that are begun by complaint."

 Now, the complaint is what Congress assumes will 

stop the provision from running. And there is always, in 

an adversary adjudication, some document that functions 

like a complaint, that provides the defendant the notice 

of what the claims are against it, and to which failure to 

respond will result in default. 

We believe that the most likely thing to be the 

complaint here is, the thing that provided us with notice,

is that -- "Boys, you've got to respond; otherwise, you're 

in trouble" -- was the order to pay. And Congress came to 

that same conclusion when it enacted -- when it enacted 

FOGRSFA and established a 7-year statute of limitations 

provision. But if we lose 2 years of the claim, and only 

get 1 because it is the agency letter, in the Court's 

view, well, that's fine, but there's some document here 

that started these agency proceedings, and it is that 

document which is a complaint.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could you get us -- we're going 

to have supplemental material filed, the OLC opinion. 

Could you -- could you get us a -- you know, a sample of 

an agency letter? Or, if you can't, maybe the Government 

can?

 MR. LAMKEN: Yes, I -- that's true. And in 

terms of the OLC letter, we offered to lodge it in our 

brief. Unfortunately, by the Court's rules, we're not 

allowed to lodge it, unless the Court specifically 

requests it. And so, that's why it's not there. But we 

will get that to you, or the Government will get it to 

you, as soon as possible.

 The actual agency letter, in this case, isn't in 

the administrative record. And it turns out that we 

haven't been able to find it, and the Government hasn't 

been able to find it. And so, it's a letter. It's a

demand letter, but it is a letter, and that -- the order 

to pay is actually the opening salvo in these proceedings. 

And again, what opens the proceedings in -- the Justice 

Department regulations and other regulations --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I suggest --

MR. LAMKEN: -- to try to define --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this, Mr. Lamken, that when 

the -- when the filing is made giving us the OLC opinion, 

you include a -- an example of such a letter?

 MR. LAMKEN: Yes. Yes. Of course.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And so, we'll get a notion of 

what it looks like.

 MR. LAMKEN: Right. It may have to be from some 

other proceeding; it wouldn't necessarily be from this 

case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your position is, this would 

apply to the universe of administrative proceedings. Now, 

this particular lease arrangement is taken care of by an 

express statute of limitations. So, what we're talking 

about, for the future -- what would change under your 

interpretation? Not gas leases, because -- there's a 7-

year limitation for both administrative orders to pay and 

MR. LAMKEN: Right.


 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- court actions.

MR. LAMKEN: Right. It would be all leases on 

Indian lands. It would be all leases which involve 

minerals other than oil and gas, whether it be coal, gold, 

silver, anything like that. It would also be all claims 

before September -- all production before September of 

1996. That introduces something of an oddity, if one 

accepts the Government's position. It would be that, for 

all claims going forward from September of 1996, the 

Government has 7 years, but, for the prior 200 years, 

those claims persist in perpetuity. When Section 2415(a) 

itself was enacted, Congress avoided precisely that result 

by deeming all prior claims to have accrued on the date 

the statute of limitations was enacted. And the very fact 

that Congress didn't do that here is evidence that 

Congress -- to the extent it has anything to do with it at 

all -- is evidence that Congress, in fact, understood that 

there already was a statute of limitations applicable. 

And, in fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What --

MR. LAMKEN: -- it also --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What other areas would we be 

messing up by finding for you? I mean, here, you know, if 

we don't find that this administrative action is covered 

by this statute of limitations, there's no statute of 

limitations. But there may -- there are other -- may be

other areas covered by this text -- namely, a suit by the 

United States -- founded upon any contract expressly or 

implied in law or in fact, where there is some kind of a 

statute of limitations.

 MR. LAMKEN: Right. There are -- there are some 

contexts in which there already is a separate 

administrative regime which would have its own statute of 

limitations. The Contract Disputes Act, as the Government 

points out, is one of those.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that would prevail over 

this --

MR. LAMKEN: Yes, because the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- because it's more --

MR. LAMKEN: -- Contract Disputes --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- specific.

 MR. LAMKEN: -- Act has an exception at the 

front and says "notwithstanding 2415." It's its own 

animal to itself. And there is a clause at the front of 

2415 that says "except as otherwise provided by Congress." 

And so, Congress often takes exceptions. And when it 

modified the Mineral Leasing Act of 1996, that was an 

exception to the 2415 regime. So, Congress knows how to 

conduct specialized situations and take things outside of 

2415 when it needs to. But it enacted Section 2415 as a 

catchall for all of those situations where Congress hadn't

managed to anticipate the circumstances. And the 

Government's premise of the whole provision is that 

Congress botched it. Congress provided a catchall that 

catches judicial actions, but leaves the Government free, 

in perpetuity, to persist -- to proceed on precisely the 

same claims for precisely the same relief, plus interest. 

And, because interest is calculated at a relatively high 

rate, that makes those old claims much, much more valuable 

than the relatively more recent claims. And it seems 

implausible to think that Congress enacted a catchall 

limitations period with a loophole so large that it 

deprives the statute of limitations period of effect 

almost entirely.

 Finally, I'd like to say, one moment about the 

statute -- the canon of strict construction. And that is 

that it doesn't always require the court to narrow 

otherwise broad statutory language, particularly where 

doing so would have the effect of rendering another 

provision -- here, subsection (i) is superfluous --

introducing anomalies into the statutory structure and 

depriving the statute of its intended effect, as the 

Bowers case we cite in our reply brief on page 16 makes 

clear. And Bowers case was virtually on point. It 

was the case where the -- it was a statute of limitations 

that could have applied to administrative agency actions,

or it could not have. And the Court declined to accept a 

narrowing construction proffered by the Government under 

statute of strict construction because it would have 

rendered one of the provisions -- one for consent 

proceedings -- superfluous, because it would have resulted 

in anomaly, and because it would have undermined the 

premise of repose which undergirded the statute of 

limitations in that case. Precisely the same things are 

true here. And, for those reasons, the Court should reach 

precisely the same result.

 If there are no further questions, thank you 

very much.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Lamken.

 The case is taken -- is -- as submitted.

 [Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
