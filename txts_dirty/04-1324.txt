[11:02 a.m.] 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in 04-1324, Day versus McDonough. 

Mr. Busby. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. BRETT BUSBY 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. BUSBY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The State does not dispute that it waived 

the affirmative defense of limitations by failing to 

raise it in the District Court and by conceding in its 

answer that Day's petition was timely. Yet, nearly a 

year into the case, after the parties had briefed the 

merits, the magistrate judge not only raised an 

argument that the petition was untimely, he actually 

imposed the State's limitations defense and dismissed 

the case, despite the State's procedural default and 

contrary concession. 

That was error, for two reasons. First, it 

violates the general principle of the adversary system 

in the civil rules that it's error to impose a 

forfeited limitations defense sua sponte, and the 

statutory text in rules have confirmed that this 

principle applies to habeas. Second, the State's

concession of timeliness based on full information was 

an express binding waiver, and it was error for the 

District Court to override that concession. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was a computation 

error. This is not a -- this is not a case where the 

State chose to waive the statute of limitations. It 

miscalculated. Isn't that the case? 

MR. BUSBY: Well, there was a 1-day 

miscalculation, Justice Ginsburg, on the -- on the 352 

versus 353 days before the -- Mr. Day filed his State 

postconviction petition. But there's a legal dispute 

as to whether the days after -- between the time --

whether the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we're not -- and we 

didn't take cert to decide if this claim was timely. 

We are on the assumption that it was untimely. But --

and what are the consequences of the State's failing 

to raise that? 

MR. BUSBY: Well, our position is that by 

expressly conceding in their petition that it was 

timely, that that's an express waiver. I mean, they 

say that they would have -- what they would have had 

to say was, "We know we have a limitations defense. 

We're expressly giving that up, that the proper 

standard is the intentional relinquishment of" --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the --


MR. BUSBY: -- "a known right." 


JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the whole basis was 


the number of days that they calculated, and the 

magistrate said, "Oh, they miscalculated. There were 

more days involved." 

MR. BUSBY: The -- yes, under Eleventh 

Circuit law, the magistrate said they should have 

counted that additional time at the end. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 

MR. BUSBY: But this Court has said that the 

standard for -- the standard for express waiver 

varies, depending on the right at stake. It's not 

always intentional relinquishment of a known right, as 

it is with some constitutional rights. 

In fact, there are several Courts of Appeals 

that have said when you plead -- when you 

affirmatively plead the opposite of an affirmative 

defense, as they did here by saying it's timely, that 

that's enough for an express waiver. And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose --

MR. BUSBY: -- this Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the magistrate 

judge had said, "I notice this error in accordance 

with Eleventh Circuit law, so I am going to suggest to

the State that they amend their answer." The State 

certainly could -- under Rule 15, if the Federal rules 

apply, the State could have amended its answer and 

done just what the magistrate judge did. 

MR. BUSBY: Well, certainly, Your Honor, 

they could have moved to amend their answer. We would 

have opposed it; and would, on remand, if the issue 

were to come up, on the ground that they had full 

information, and so that this is not an appropriate 

case to amend an answer. But I agree with you that 

that would have been one option, and that's the way 

that the Third Circuit analyzes this issue in the Long 

case and in the Bendolph case, using the principles of 

Rule 15. The Fifth -- the Eleventh Circuit did not do 

that here. It said that there was an obligation for 

the court to impose the limitations defense; it did 

not apply the Rule 15 --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I --

MR. BUSBY: -- analysis. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did it say "an 

obligation," or that the court "could"? It didn't --

I didn't think it said the court "must." 

MR. BUSBY: It did say, Your Honor, that 

there was an obligation for the court to impose it to 

further comity, finality, and federalism, and that can

be found on page 5(a) of the appendix to the petition, 

"A Federal Court that sits in collateral review has an 

obligation to enforce the Federal statute of 

limitations." And, in fact, they quote the Advisory 

Committee notes to Rule 4, saying the court has the 

duty to screen out. And they also expressly 

distinguished their precedent in Esslinger versus 

Davis, which relied on Granberry versus Greer, to say 

it was a discretionary analysis. They said, "We're 

not going to consider the discretionary issues raised 

in Esslinger and Granberry whether this dismissal 

would serve an important Federal interest. We're just 

going to say there's an obligation to impose this, and 

that the District" --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is -- I see --

you're referring to page 4(a) and --

MR. BUSBY: 5(a), Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. Which -- where is 

the sentence that says it -- that --

MR. BUSBY: The obligation is seven lines 

from the bottom, and it's that last paragraph, where 

they're distinguishing Esslinger. And the sentence of 

the previous paragraph is where they say there's a 

"duty." 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that that duty

is in connection with Rule 4. 

MR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor, and then they -

- they rely on that duty to say that there is an 

obligation, in the next paragraph, and to 

distinguishing Essingler and say, "We don't have to go 

through this discretionary analysis, because there's 

an obligation." 

And so, our position is that even --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, the -- it's right that 

there's an obligation if it notices it in the first 

instance on its first review. 

MR. BUSBY: Well, we don't necessarily 

agree, Your Honor, if -- we don't necessarily agree 

that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And suppose, under the 

review proceedings, that District Court is looking at 

it for the first time, without yet having required a 

response, and he sees a statute of limitation. I 

assume there's an obligation. 

MR. BUSBY: Under Rule 4? 


JUSTICE KENNEDY: Sure. 


MR. BUSBY: Well, Your Honor, if you'd look 


at what rule --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, if -- suppose it's 

an open-and-shut violation of the statute of

limitations, or barred by the statute of limitations -

-

MR. BUSBY: Uh-huh. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- does District Court 

have discretion to refer to the State for a response? 

MR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor, we would say 

that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Really? 

MR. BUSBY: -- that they must do that, 

because, as this Court recognized in Pliler versus 

Ford, it's almost never apparent on the face of the 

petition --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, my --

MR. BUSBY: -- that there's an --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, my --

MR. BUSBY: -- open-and-shut --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- my hypothetical is that 

it is. 

MR. BUSBY: Okay. I would think that even 

if it were apparent on the face of the petition, that 

the -- Rule 4 has two parts. In the first part of it, 

the nonadversary screening function, only applies when 

the petitioner is plainly not entitled to relief. And 

I think the better view of that -- of that clause is -

- although there are some arguments in our brief that

don't take this view -- I -- after having given it 

thought, I think the better view of that clause is 

that it does not apply to an affirmative defense 

that's subject to waiver or tolling, that you can't 

say, based on an affirmative defense that's subject to 

waiver or tolling, that someone is plainly not 

entitled to relief. You could say, for example --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because the other --

because the other side might make a mistake and not 

recognize it? 

MR. BUSBY: Or it might be tolled, Your 

Honor. And there are also four different trigger 

dates in the statute for when it can first apply, that 

you aren't going to be able to tell, necessarily, 

three of them from the face of the petition. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or the other side may say, 

"Although technically the statute of limitations 

applied here, taking all considerations into account 

we think that this prisoner acted with reasonable 

promptness, and perhaps the delay was somewhat 

attributable to the State." Do you think that that's 

a proper consideration? 

MR. BUSBY: Absolutely, Your Honor. There -

- the statute of limitations in AEDPA is designed to 

prevent delay, not to -- as Congress has said, it's

not a forfeiture provision; it's designed to move 

these complaints along speedily, particularly in 

capital cases, of which this is not one. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- it could be 

argued that the Federal Government wants to move them 

along speedily, whether or not the State government 

wants to. 

MR. BUSBY: Certainly. And their --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, that would suggest that 

the State's voluntary waiver of a statute of 

limitations should not make any difference. It's a 

Federal -- it's a Federal interest involved, not a 

State interest. 

MR. BUSBY: Well, they -- there is an 

interest in judicial efficiency that's at issue here, 

too, but we submit that it's far more inefficient for 

the Court to put limitations under this first category 

of Rule 4 and say that the Court must, on its own, 

look at limitations every time, without assistance 

from the parties, than it is to make the State do its 

job. I mean, they're the ones, as this --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we could --

MR. BUSBY: -- Court recognized --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- we could -- we could 

agree with you that there is isn't an obligation on

the Federal judge to raise it, but the question is, 

you know, the -- it could be a "must," it can be "may 

not," or it could be "may." 

MR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And why shouldn't we 

treat this as a "may"? The judge noticed the clerical 

error and called it to the party's attention by an 

order to show cause. 

MR. BUSBY: Well, the proper procedure under 

Rule 4 is not to call it to the party's attention in 

that way; it's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: We're past Rule 4, 

because an answer has been ordered. 

MR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- and it's only when 

the answer comes in that this issue is spotted. 

MR. BUSBY: Yes. That's correct. And I 

agree with you that the proper procedure after that 

would be to bring the issue to the party's attention 

and let the State decide whether it wanted to file a 

motion to amend under Rule 15; and, if it did so, 

there are very clear standards that are applied, that 

were not applied in this case, to decide --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are very what 

standards?

 MR. BUSBY: There are very clear standards, 

Your Honor --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, "leave shall be 

freely given." 

MR. BUSBY: Yes, but there are also -- it's 

a -- again, it's a discretionary determination, and 

there are prejudice issues that should be considered 

as the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what would be the 

prejudice that could be claimed by the habeas 

petitioner? 

MR. BUSBY: Well, the prejudice in this case 

is that the standards of Rule 15 were not considered; 

but, in addition, there are -- there are well-

recognized decisions, both from this Court and from 

the Courts of Appeals, that went -- that says a judge 

may deny leave to amend when the -- at the time the 

concession is made. And the answer -- the State had 

full information. And the State admits here that it 

had all the information it needed to make the 

limitations calculation attached to its answer, in 

which it conceded timeliness, and then -- but then 

waited a year, or several months, to bring it up 

later. And so, we would argue, if this were a Rule 15 

analysis, that it would not be appropriate for the

Court to allow the amendment. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Are you --

MR. BUSBY: Now, also --

JUSTICE ALITO: Are you saying that the 

error is simply that it wasn't done via Rule 15? What 

if we were to say that the same considerations apply 

when it's simply raised sua sponte by the -- by the --

by the District Court? What would be your objection 

to that? 

MR. BUSBY: Well, that would be -- that's 

the Respondent's position, and I think, in addition to 

those considerations, if you disagree that this is a 

forfeiture, that -- and you disagree that this is an 

express waiver, and you get to their position that, 

you know, this is a discretionary test and you should 

just apply the same Rule 15 factors, I think you need 

to also apply a presumption against sua sponte 

consideration. 

There's one way to do it under Rule 4, and 

that's the most efficient way. It's also the way that 

comports with judicial neutrality in the adversary 

system. And so, to encourage people --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you couldn't do this 

under Rule 4, because, as you, I think, recognized, 

that, just from the petition, from the habeas

petition, you couldn't tell. 

MR. BUSBY: I'm sorry, Justice --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There wasn't --

MR. BUSBY: -- Ginsburg, I misspoke. I 

meant to say Rule 15. But if -- to encourage parties 

to do this under Rule 15, the Court should adopt a 

presumption against sua sponte consideration. And 

this -- in Arizona versus California, which they rely 

on heavily, they say that this type of consideration 

should be reserved for rare circumstances. And we 

cite several cases in our brief where that -- that 

also support that proposition. So, we would submit, 

if you do get to this analysis, Justice Alito, that 

there should also be a presumption involved. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if you think it's --

if it's done under Rule 15, would the considerations 

necessarily be exactly the same in a habeas case as in 

an ordinary civil case? 

MR. BUSBY: Not necessarily. I mean, there 

-- but we do submit that the timing issue that we just 

raised, about them having full information, would 

certainly be something we'd argue to the District 

Court in its discretion. But another thing you have 

to consider, to your point, is that limitations is 

something that's -- that has a subtle meaning and

derive -- and is directly addressed by Civil Rules 8 

and 12. And this Court, in Gonzalez and Mayle, says 

that when that happens, that's where you start, with 

the civil rules. And then you ask if there's anything 

in the habeas statutes or rules that's inconsistent 

with that approach, with the -- with the forfeiture 

approach of the civil rules. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the civil rules 

allow for amendment. 

MR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's 8(c), and there's 

12(b), but there's also 15. 

MR. BUSBY: Yes, I agree. And that was not 

used in this case. I -- and I -- we agree that that 

would be an appropriate way to raise this. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It seems the height of 

technicality to say that the judge could suggest, 

"Now, State, I will entertain a motion to amend the 

answer, under Rule 15," instead of saying, "I'm 

issuing an order to show cause why this action is not 

out of time." 

MR. BUSBY: Well, I don't agree, Your Honor, 

because there's a specific analysis that goes along 

with Rule 15 that wasn't applied here. But, in 

addition to that, there's an efficiency interest to be

served by having the State calculate and make the 

motion, rather than putting the burden on the Federal 

Court to do it. The Court, we submit, should make the 

State -- they -- this Court, in Pliler, said the 

State's in the best position to make the limitations 

calculation. It's an error-prone fact-intensive, 

burdensome calculation, and they shouldn't be allowed 

to foist that burden on the Court. The Court should 

make them do their job. 

And so, our position is that that's the 

reason that it should be done under Rule 15. It also 

doesn't put the State in the position of being an 

advocate -- excuse me -- it doesn't put the Court in 

the position of being an advocate for the State and 

having them say -- having the Court directly across 

the bench from the Petitioner, not involving the 

State, saying, "Here are -- I'm developing some 

arguments on behalf of the State now why this is 

untimely. What do you have to say about it?" That's 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does -- proceeding 

under 15 does not do that; whereas, proceeding this 

way does? 

MR. BUSBY: Well, proceeding under 15, I --

you want to make a motion to amend?" 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wink, wink? 

MR. BUSBY: Well -- but --

[Laughter.] 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, there is some value 

in that, I think, particularly where the State has 

expressly conceded timeliness. I mean, the magistrate 

judge in this case, all that he had before him was the 

express concession from the State. He never -- the 

State never said anything in the District Court, even 

after he issued his notice to the Petitioner to show 

cause why it wasn't untimely. So, the magistrate 

judge, all he had before him was the State's position 

that it was timely. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that concern 

present in Granberry, as well? And yet, the Court 

reached the opposite result there. 

MR. BUSBY: I don't think so, Your Honor, 

because in Granberry the State raised the issue for 

the first time on appeal, the court did not. So, 

there, you do have the adversary system at work. In 

addition, Granberry is different for several other 

reasons. Exhaustions is, unlike limitations, unique 

to habeas corpus; it's not covered by Rule 8. And, 

also, it's a common-law limit that this Court has

developed on habeas relief. It's not a statutory 

affirmative defense. And, as our brief points out, 

Congress has treated these very differently when it 

codified them in AEDPA. And this applies not only to 

exhaustion, but nonretroactivity, abuse of the writ, 

and procedural default. I'm sorry, procedural default 

was not codified. But they other defenses -- the 

other limits on habeas relief that the Petitioner 

relies on were codified very differently in AEDPA; 

whereas, for exhaustion it says, "Relief shall not be 

granted unless you exhaust." That's a substantive 

limit on relief. 

For limitations, however, it says when 

you're --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One that requires 

the court to raise it sua sponte, even if it's not 

raised by the State. 

MR. BUSBY: I beg your pardon? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One that requires 

the court to raise it sua sponte, even if not raised 

by the State, correct? 

MR. BUSBY: Potentially, yes, if you codify 

it as a substantive limit on relief. Whereas, 

limitations is simply codified -- it says, "a period 

of limitations shall apply." It doesn't say, "Relief

It doesn't even say, as it does in the capital 

context, for certain -- for capital opt-in States, 

that it must be filed by a certain time. It just says 

"a period of limitation." And that has a settled 

meaning that goes along with it. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Your position is, it should 

be like any other civil case. 

MR. BUSBY: Yes, Your Honor. And --

JUSTICE BREYER: You can raise it sua 

sponte, we've said, in exceptional circumstances.

MR. BUSBY: Uh-huh.

State says, "Oh, my goodness. Quite right. We'd like 

to amend."

there was an alteration in a date, and the Third 

Circuit didn't ascribe that to any particular person,

before it had the wrong date on it from which to 

calculate.

for that? And, if not, aren't you asking us to waste

easier way and --

MR. BUSBY: I don't think so, Your Honor.

something that the judge must raise, I think you're

it to the parties to raise it. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what's your answer as 

to whether there is any limitation on the judge just 

suggesting, "By the way, you know, is there some 

reason why you haven't pleaded statute of 

limitations?" Can a -- can a judge do that? 

MR. BUSBY: Well, I would think that, you 

know, it would be evaluated under an abuse-of-

discretion standard, and I haven't -- I haven't given 

much --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And what -- when would it 

be an abuse of discretion? 

MR. BUSBY: For a judge to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MR. BUSBY: -- invite the State to amend? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. BUSBY: I would say if -- it would be, 

in this case, perhaps, because of the State's express 

concession to the contrary, and -- so that that might 

be one circumstance. But I don't think this --

abuse of discretion for him to suggest an amendment if 

he's got the opportunity to rule on the amendment 

later on. And then presumably the ruling would be 

reviewed for abuse of discretion. 

MR. BUSBY: That's a good point, Your Honor. 

I don't think this Court needs to circumscribe the 

judge's authority to suggest an amendment. I think 

you could wrap it all into the ruling and evaluate 

that for abuse of discretion. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I suppose it might be an 

abuse of discretion if you'd already had a hearing and 

took -- and decided that there was merit to the 

plaintiff's claim, and then decided, "Well, now I'm 

going to just throw it out on limitations," might be 

an abuse of discretion. 

MR. BUSBY: I would agree with that, yes, 

Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why 

doesn't that same standard apply to the decision of 

the Court to raise it sua sponte? 

MR. BUSBY: Well, because in this case you 

have an express concession. And so, it's a -- this 

Court has said, and other courts have said, that when 

you have an express concession, it's error to override 

that concession and impose the defense sua sponte.

The Court should, instead, assume that the concession 

is valid and that refusal to honor it is an abuse of 

discretion. You --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Were those --

MR. BUSBY: -- don't want to strip --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- cases -- were those 

cases of a miscalculation on the part of the State? 

The judge's view was that the State had miscalculated 

under eleventh-amendment -- under Eleventh Circuit 

precedent. 

MR. BUSBY: Well, Your Honor, most of those 

cases involved other issues, like exhaustion and 

procedural default, where the State later came back 

and said, "We were mistaken that they exhausted," or, 

"We were mistaken that they didn't procedurally 

default this claim." So, it's a similar mistake 

claim, but, nonetheless, the State affirmatively 

pleaded the opposite of either exhaustion, procedural 

default, or limitations. And the court held them to 

that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you'd say it would be 

okay if the State didn't expressly concede the statute 

of limitations point. 

MR. BUSBY: Possibly. But, again, I think 

if you -- if you use the analysis of the civil rules

that applies here, by virtue of Civil Rule 81 and 

Habeas Rule 11, that it's error -- our first position 

is that it's error to override the forfeiture --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's --

MR. BUSBY: -- except in --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought your

MR. BUSBY: Except in exceptional --


JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So, this --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- a fallback position. 


MR. BUSBY: Yes. That's correct. And then 


our second fallback position is that even if Your --

even if Your Honors agree that the court could -- has 

discretion to override the express waiver, that 

there's at least a discretionary analysis that has to 

apply under Civil Rule 15 that's coupled with a 

presumption in -- against sua sponte dismissal that 

the Eleventh Circuit didn't apply here. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Why, just out of curiosity 

-- I'm not familiar with the actual practice of a lot 

of civil cases, but when somebody -- let's say the 

defendant in an ordinary tort case forgets to put in

the statute of limitations, and the case is all tried 

and finished. At the very end, he says, "Oh, my God." 

And now he goes in and asks to amend it under Rule 

15. 	 Do judges normally say, "Fine"? 

MR. BUSBY: I -- they normally say no, that 

that's --

JUSTICE BREYER: Because it's --

MR. BUSBY: The -- because the case has gone 

on down the road on another theory, and it's 

prejudicial to the parties, and it wastes -- it's a 

waste of the court's judicial resources to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But here, nothing --

happened. There was --

MR. BUSBY: Well --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The answer was put in, 

and then there were no further proceedings. Nothing 

else went on in the court. 

MR. BUSBY: Well --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's quite different -- I 

don't know any judge that would allow a defendant, 

after the trial is over, to raise the statute of 

limitations. But, up front, it's a different 

situation.

 MR. BUSBY: Well, we disagree that this was 

up front, Your Honor. The answer in a -- habeas 

corpus cases, of course, heavily deals with the 

merits, as it did in this case. And then, Mr. Day 

replied. And, as the State's amicus brief points out, 

that's all that usually happens in most habeas corpus 

cases. So, we were near the end of the proceeding, as 

-- if you think of the run-of-the-mine habeas corpus 

case. 

And, also, speaking of run-of-the-mine 

habeas corpus cases, this is a very rare instance. 

There are -- there are lots of procedures for courts 

to vindicate the interest that the State describes in 

comity, finality, and federalism, whether inviting a 

motion to -- whether ordering the State to file a 

motion to dismiss under Rule 4, which we submit would 

be the proper procedure, or, if the State fails to 

raise it in its answer in certain circumstances, 

inviting them to file a motion to amend under Rule 15. 

That takes care of these interests in the run-of-the-

mine case. 

There's no need to vindicate those interests 

in this case by creating an exception to the rules. 

This Court has said, in Lonchar and in Carlisle, that 

where there are civil rules that deal with the -- and

habeas rules -- that deal with how these things 

happen, the Court cannot use its inherent powers to 

circumvent those rules. And we submit that that's 

exactly what the court did here. 

Now, in addition, I'd like to point the 

Court to New York versus Hill, which is not cited in 

our briefs, but can be found at 528 U.S. at 114 to -15 

and also 118, on this express waiver issue. And this 

is a case where the Court recognized exactly the point 

that we make here, that not all -- you don't always 

have to show intentional relinquishment of a known 

right for that to be the standard for waiver. It 

depends on the right at issue. There, it was an 

International Agreement on Detainers Act case, and the 

Court held that the -- that the defendant's assent to 

delay waived the time limitation of the Interstate 

Agreement on Detainers Act, expressly waived it. And 

that's our -- that's our position here, is that the 

State's affirmative pleading of timeliness is an 

express waiver. 

In addition, the State could -- certainly 

couldn't prevail, under the Brady versus U.S. standard 

that applies to plea agreements, for saying that its 

concession was not knowing. There's no -- there's no 

suggestion here that the State was misled. There's no

suggestion that they didn't have all the information 

they needed to make the calculation. And Brady says 

that simply misapprehending a factor -- a relevant 

factor in the analysis is not enough. And that's at 

397 U.S. at page 757. 

In addition, the State makes an argument 

about policies beyond the concerns of the parties, and 

that the State -- that those should be vindicated in 

this case. But I'd like to point out that this Court 

has not adopted the "beyond the concerns of the 

parties" test; rather, it's acknowledged that Congress 

entrusts even important public policies, like comity, 

finality, and federalism, to the adversary process; 

and, thus, their -- and even private rights that 

benefit society can be waived, in Christiansburg 

Garment, for example. 

With the Court's permission, I'd like to 

reserve the balance of my time.

was consistent with AEDPA and the habeas rules. It 

was consistent with this Court's habeas jurisprudence. 

And it was consistent with the purpose behind, and 

not prohibited by, Federal Rules 8 and 12. 

This case is not about the State's waiver. 

And we would agree that -- with Justice Scalia, that 

the waiver is not the beginning and end of it. We're 

not conceding that the State, in fact, waived it here, 

but we're saying that that's not essential to the 

answer to this question, because it's not the 

beginning and the end of the analysis. 

This case is also not about, as the 

Petitioner alleges in the brief and makes inference on 

the Eleventh Circuit's opinion, about obligating 

courts to act in all circumstances. 

This case is about the proper exercise of 

discretion. And what we're really asking this Court 

to do is really three things: to acknowledge again 

that this authority exists, to say that this is when 

the court may exercise that authority under the 

circumstances presented by this case, And then, 

thirdly, that this is how the Court goes about 

exercising this authority, by providing notice and 

opportunity to be heard, and conducting an analysis of 

prejudice. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, don't you think 

that's what this court thought? And, if so, shouldn't 

we perhaps send it back to see whether, if the court 

knew that it had discretion, it would have done this? 

MR. KISE: Your Honor, respectfully, I don't 

think that that's what the Eleventh Circuit thought. 

I think that that is an interpretation of the Eleventh 

Circuit's language. However, I think that where the 

phrase that Counsel pointed to in the opinion -- on 

page 5(a), referencing "obligation" -- I believe that 

the Court there was referring to, specifically under 

Rule 4, that the court has this obligation. I think 

it -- because it's in that discussion that the Court 

is talking about the obligation. And I would submit 

that, indeed, under Rule 4, in response, I believe, to 

Justice -- a point Justice Kennedy raised, I would say 

that, under Rule 4, I think it is obligation. I think 

what Rule 4 is, is a reflection of Congress -- excuse 

me -- of the rule advising the court that, "You must 

exercise this authority that you already have at this 

particular time. This is the time when you need to be 

looking for these things."

- Mr. Busby told us that the reference was in the 

following paragraph, and it is the sentence, "A 

Federal Court that sits in collateral review of a 

criminal judgment of a State Court has an obligation 

to enforce the Federal statute of limitations." 

That's the sentence that suggests that the Court of 

Appeals thought that there was an obligation, the 

District Court, to raise the statute of limitations on 

its own motion. 

MR. KISE: Your Honor -- and I was referring 

to that sentence, and perhaps I wasn't clear, but I 

would -- I would say that they are still talking about 

Rule 4. But even if they're not talking about Rule 4, 

even if, in fact, this Court believes that the 

District -- that the Circuit Court's analysis is 

flawed, then we must keep in mind that this Court is 

reviewing judgments, not opinions. And this Court 

could easily do what it did in Gonzalez, which is, 

even though the analysis is not consistent with what 

this Court -- I mean, frankly, if the Court takes that 

view with what we're asking the Court to do here --

but you can nevertheless affirm the judgment. Because 

the District Court did, in fact, get it right. The --

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What would you say --

assuming that we're beyond Rule 4, what would you say 

simply to a rule that said, "Yes, we recognize that 

there remains a discretion -- not an obligation, but a 

discretion -- on the part of the court to raise this." 

But, just as a -- as a general rule, judicial 

efficiency is better served by avoiding the use of 

discretion unless the State, in fact, raises the 

limitations issue, itself. The courts have a lot of 

things to do, and they shouldn't be spending their 

time canvassing pleadings to see whether there might 

be an issue that the State missed; so that in the 

absence of some extraordinary circumstance, it would 

be an abuse of discretion to exercise it as the -- as 

the Circuit suggests it should have been exercised 

here. What would you say to that position? 

MR. KISE: I would say, respectfully, Your 

Honor, that that is somewhat inconsistent, if not 

entirely inconsistent, with what this Court said in 

Granberry and Caspari, dealing with the same sort of 

raising of affirmative defenses. From that 

standpoint, from a procedural standpoint, I would say 

that Granberry and Caspari are procedurally 

indistinct, in that this Court said that it is 

appropriate, in these circumstances, for the court to

look at affirmative defenses. Obviously, they have 

substantive differences, which my -- which Counsel has 

pointed out, but, from a procedural standpoint, were 

the Petitioner to prevail here, I would think this 

Court needs to recede procedurally from Granberry and 

Caspari --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What --

MR. KISE: -- because the Court --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What, then, would be the 

significance here of the fact that the State conceded 

that there was no limitations problem? In a case like 

that, wouldn't it be a good rule to avoid judicial 

inquiry? 

MR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, I think that 

the State's concession, as Justice Scalia pointed out, 

is not the beginning and end of it, in the first 

instance. Secondly, it --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it bears on the 

exercise of discretion. 

MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor, it does. And we 

would agree that it bears on the exercise of 

discretion. And, in a circumstance such as this one, 

where the attachments, the record itself, indicated 

that there was a discrepancy between the position the 

State was taking and what the record actually

reflected, it was appropriate for the District Court 

to raise the issue and then consider the interests of 

the parties. If the District Court had been presented 

simply with nothing in the record, just a blanket 

statement by the -- by Florida that, "We concede," and 

there was nothing to raise the question, then we would 

-- we would say that it's not appropriate for the 

court to simply pull issues out of the sky. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: That would be an abuse. 

MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor. I would say 

that it would be an abuse. 

JUSTICE BREYER: District judges can't 

comment on the cases? And -- they suddenly raise 

something, curious about something; and, lo and 

behold, it becomes the subject of an amendment. 

MR. KISE: Well, Justice --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's a violation of -- I 

mean, what I'm driving at is, I don't really 

understand Rule 15 thoroughly, because I'm not a trial 

lawyer. And why do we have to decide every matter? 

Why don't we let the District judge free to run his 

trial and just say, "Hey, we don't want to proliferate 

law. It's complicated enough already. Let's leave it 

to Rule 15, whatever that might be"? 

MR. KISE: I think leaving it to Rule 15 is

one way to do it. And doing it in these particular 

cases is another way. Giving the courts discretion to 

raise the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but the other way 

means we're now going to have a new area of law. The 

new area of law consists of habeas law involving what 

is the equivalent of an amendment suggested by the 

judge to bring up a statute. That would be good, 

because West would then have five more pages, with a 

new keynote --

[Laughter.] 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- and there would be more 

for lawyers to look up. Whereas, if you just say Rule 

15, it's finished. 

MR. KISE: Respectfully, Your Honor, I 

believe this Court's already done that, though, in 

Granberry and Caspari. I mean, that's what you've 

already said, is that, under -- that habeas is 

different. And I think it's important to point out, 

we're not asking for a different construction of Rules 

8 and 12. We're asking this Court to apply the same 

exception that is applied in the extraordinary case. 

The Petitioner takes the position -- and Petitioner is 

alone in this contention -- that "ordinarily" means 

"never." Even the law professor amici don't take

position, and there is not a case that we have been 

able to locate in the country that says that 

"ordinarily" means "never," that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you say it's --

MR. KISE: -- the ordinary rule --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- means it's "hardly 

ever"? I mean, we do follow the principle of party 

presentation. And judges are not supposed to be 

intruding issues on their own, they are supposed to 

follow the party's presentation. So, would this be --

if it's not "never," would it be at least "hardly 

ever," that it's appropriate for a judge to interject 

an affirmative defense on his own motion? 

MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor, I would say that 

it is "hardly ever," and that's what we're dealing 

with here. It's what the Court was dealing with in 

Granberry and Caspari, these limited circumstances 

where the interests transcend the interests of just 

the parties before the court and where it is, from the 

-- from a review of the record, as District judges do 

every day looking at the record and identifying 

issues, and to avoid the sort of conundrum that's 

presented by the Petitioner agreeing that the District 

judge could simply look at the State and, as Justice 

Scalia said, wink, wink, "It's okay for you to raise

this issue now," to avoid the roundabout that is 

occasioned by that. If it is, in fact, permissible in 

these circumstances for the District Court to raise 

the issue, then doing it the way the court did it 

here, and the way that was approved in Bendolph, and 

the way that we believe the Eleventh Circuit approved 

it, is entirely appropriate, because it's consistent 

with what this Court said in its habeas jurisprudence. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What if Congress wanted to 

leave it to the State to waive the statute of 

limitations provision? How could it have made that 

clear? I mean, I would have thought that if they made 

it a statute of limitations provision instead of a 

jurisdictional provision -- I mean, they could have 

said, you know, "No jurisdiction if it's filed beyond 

a certain date, and we mean it." But it put it as a 

statute of limitation, which normally is waivable. 

And I would think that that is an indication that 

Congress thought, "Really, if the State thinks that in 

this particular case we shouldn't hew to the 

technicality of the statute of limitation, the State 

ought to be able to waive it. 

MR. KISE: And I think that's why it is set 

up the way it is, Your Honor, but it's just that the 

waiver is not the beginning and end of it. For

example, where the State might wish to waive the 

statute of limitations and simply move to the merits 

would be in a situation where there might be some 

complex argument over equitable tolling and where the 

merits are relatively straightforward. Rather than 

spending the court's time and the resources involved 

and litigating over equitable tolling, the State might 

simply say, "We realize that there is this 

technicality here, but we're going to get to the 

merits, because otherwise we're going to spend an 

inordinate amount of time litigating." 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's always a 

technicality. What you're saying is, the only time 

that the State can do that is when the answer to the 

statute of limitations is unclear. And I'm saying 

sometimes the State may say, "The answer is clear, but 

doggone it, this is just too picky-picky, too 

technical in this particular case." 

MR. KISE: And, Your Honor, our test allows 

for that, as well. It's up to the District Court to 

decide whether, in that particular case, the 

circumstances require the application. There is some 

discretion. I don't think that the State could --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it -- would it 

always be an abuse of discretion for the District

Court to do this if the State wanted to reach the 

merits? 

MR. KISE: I don't think so, Your Honor, 

because it would depend on why the State wanted to 

reach the merits. Perhaps the State was engaging in 

some sort of gaming of the system, as Petitioner 

alleges could happen. If there was, in fact, some 

actual sandbagging going on, where the State is 

holding this issue in reserve as a strategic matter, 

and the District Court simply says, "No, we're not 

going to allow that." And it would really be the same 

analysis under Rule 15. If the court were to have 

sandbagged, so to speak, under Rule 15 and waited to 

file a late amendment, the court would engage in the 

same analysis. The court would say, "Well, wait, do I 

really want to permit the State, now, to assert this?" 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no question 

of -- put aside a sandbagging case, there's no 

question of sandbagging, and that the -- the State 

just wants to litigate on the merits rather than on 

the statute of limitations. 

MR. KISE: It would not always be an abuse 

of discretion. I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, can 

they have it -- would it be an abuse of discretion in

an express waiver case as opposed to a forfeiture 

case? 

MR. KISE: I don't think that you could say, 

in all circumstances -- no, Your Honor, it would not 

be an abuse of discretion in all circumstances. But I 

do think the District Court needs to factor in the 

interests of the State and the reasons why the State 

is willing to proceed forward. And if the State, for 

example, is, as I believe an example was given by the 

court, that the State is -- believes that, "Well, 

perhaps it's appropriate to waive the statute here, or 

to not rely on the statute here, because of something 

maybe we have done, or that it -- the Petitioner 

didn't -- missed the deadline by a certain period of 

time, and we think that, in this particular case, it's 

all right to reach those merits." 

So, I can't -- I don't think we should say 

that it's always an abuse of discretion, but I think 

we need to leave it to District Courts to make that 

determination, just as this Court did in Granberry and 

Caspari. This Court gave District Courts that 

discretion, because these are the types of cases where 

that discretion is appropriate. This Court's already 

identified that, in habeas cases, we are to treat 

Rules 8 and 12 as the exception being applied, that

these --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought in Granberry 

the Court gave the Court of Appeals that discretion, 

since it hadn't -- the point had been missed in the 

District Court, been missed by everybody, until the 

Court of Appeals. 

MR. KISE: Well, Your Honor, in fact, this 

Court did give the Court of Appeals that discretion, 

but even more so than we would give the District Court 

that discretion, because, Why should we wait for the 

process to get all the way to the Court of Appeals? 

If this Court is going to say it's appropriate for the 

Court of Appeals to look at an affirmative defense, 

then certainly, in keeping with that reasoning, it 

would be appropriate for a District Court to raise it 

before we've gone through the entire process of 

litigation in the District Court and then getting 

ourselves to the Court of Appeals. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You acknowledge at least 

this much, or am I incorrect? And it's important for 

me to know that. You acknowledge at least this much, 

that if we read this opinion, as you do not, to be 

saying that the court "must" do this so that the court 

was not really considering all factors in the exercise 

of its discretion, we would have to remand.

 MR. KISE: No, Your Honor, I would not, and 

I'll tell you why I would not. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. 

MR. KISE: It's because, just as in 

Gonzalez, the Court is not reviewing the opinion. The 

Court is reviewing the judgment. And the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why would --

MR. KISE: -- judgment is correct. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- why would you deal 

with that hypothetical when the Eleventh Circuit, in 

all fairness, said, "We join the Second, Fourth, 

Fifth, and Ninth Circuit, and rule that, even though 

the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, 

the District Court may review the timeliness of the 

2254." That's what -- the question that the court 

thought it was deciding. 

MR. KISE: I would agree that the court 

thought it was deciding discretion, but I was 

responding, I -- to what I thought was Justice 

Scalia's question about, What if this Court does not 

agree with that? If this Court believes that the 

Eleventh Circuit, in fact, was applying an obligation 

rule, a mandatory rule, then it would require remand. 

And I -- what I'm saying, Your Honor, is -- is that 

we would not, because the District Court applied the

appropriate test. In the first instance, I would say 

that the Eleventh Circuit did not, in fact, apply that 

test, did not believe that it was obligated to, but if 

this Court were to disagree, as Justice Scalia has 

presented the hypothetical, then I would say that the 

District Court did, in fact, apply the correct test. 

The District Court, as noted in -- on page 8(a) of the 

petition appendix, the footnote in the magistrate's 

report and recommendation cites Jackson, the Eleventh 

Circuit case which stands for the discretionary 

proposition, and indicates specifically that it is 

relying on a discretionary test. And so, the District 

Court in this case, in fact, applied the test that we 

are advocating, and in -- and, frankly, got it right. 

The District Court applied discretion, raised the 

issue, provided a notice and an opportunity to be 

heard, conducted the analysis of prejudice -- there 

was no prejudice in this case -- and ruled, on that 

basis. And that ruling was consistent with this 

Court's habeas jurisprudence, and it was consistent 

with AEDPA and with the habeas rules. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why doesn't your 

position on the underlying merits of the timeliness 

question create an incentive for every habeas 

petitioner to file a cert petition?

 MR. KISE: I'm not sure I follow your --

MR. KISE: -- your question, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you only get the 

extra 90 days if you actually file, under your 

explanation for why this cert petition is -- why this 

habeas petition is untimely. In other words, if this 

individual had filed a cert petition with us, his 

petition -- his habeas petition would be timely. And 

he's only going to get the extra period, as I 

understand your position on the timeliness, if he 

files a cert petition. 

MR. KISE: I understand our position to be 

that they do not get the 90 days, postconviction. And 

if that is misstated in our brief -- but I --

certainly we're not attempting to encourage the filing 

of cert petitions by habeas petitioners. And we 

believe the statute provides for the 90 days, 

postdirect review, but not after following State 

postconviction. Once the State postconviction 

proceedings are no longer pending, meaning that they 

are completed for State purposes, not including the 90 

days --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

MR. KISE: -- that's when they terminate.

MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, doesn't that put 

them in the position of sometimes having to file that 

-- the habeas petition while the cert petition is 

still pending, if they file one? 

MR. KISE: Yes, Your Honor, it might. It 

does present that conundrum. But that's what the 

statute provides. That is the way the statute has 

provided for it. And we think that interpretation is 

consistent, because there certainly -- as was 

referenced in the first oral argument, there is some 

expectation that the court might grant certiorari, but 

it's not in the -- the likely case. And so, to 

suspend the congressional purpose of moving these 

cases through the system on the chance that the one in 

a thousand, or perhaps more than one in a thousand, 

case is granted certiorari would not be an appropriate 

process to utilize. And I think the Circuit Courts 

bear that out. The opinions of all but one of the 

Circuits bear that -- bear that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there a conflict on the 

Circuits on that point? I don't know.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER 

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

There is nothing in either the habeas rules 

or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that deprives 

the District Court of its authority sua sponte to 

recognize the untimeliness of a habeas petition. To 

the contrary, to the extent the rules speak to the 

issue at all, they confirm that in light of the 

significant social cost of Federal review of State 

Court convictions, the Federal Courts have a unique

responsibility to weed out unmeritorious claims and to 

enforce the limitations on habeas review. 

Rule 4 imposes an obligation on the court to 

dismiss unmeritorious petitions without even calling 

for an answer by the State. Now, Rule 4 is not 

applicable here, but the absence of an obligation to 

note the deficiency sua sponte does not connote a 

prohibition on acting sua sponte; rather, it suggests 

that it lies in the court's discretion. That is 

exactly how this Court addressed similar question in 

Granberry, where it rejected the two extremes -- one, 

recognizing the limitation as jurisdictional, that the 

court was obligated to raise it sua sponte, but also 

rejecting the opposite extreme, that the court was 

prohibited to address an issue that had not been 

preserved in the District Court. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Why, though, would we have 

a special rule in this respect for habeas cases? Same 

question I've had throughout. Treat it like any other 

civil case. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It's not really a 

special rule that we're advocating. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right, if it's not a 

special rule, then the answer to this is, just say, 

"No, you don't have to raise it sua sponte. Moreover,

you cannot raise it sua sponte, except in exceptional 

circumstances," cite the three cases that said that. 

And, as far as you're suggesting it to people, you 

could do it just as much as you do in any other civil 

case, no special rule. If they want to move to amend, 

fine, end of case, we did it in a paragraph. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: The relevant 

analogy in the civil context is not to what a court 

would do with a statute of limitations defense in the 

civil context, it is to what would the court do with 

respect to an affirmative defense that, like the 

habeas limitations, implicates broader social 

interests? 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the same with strike 

suits. You know, there are a lot of class-action 

strike suits and so forth that at least one group of 

people think are terrible and the other group think 

are great. So, you say, "Well, we're going to have a 

special thing here for amendments in strike suits. 

Have a special amendment for some" -- you know, why 

proliferate law? 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, the Court 

recognized -- Arizona v. California is an example of 

the broader social interests that are implicated by 

the affirmative defense of res judicata. And the

Court noted, in Arizona versus California, that it 

would be appropriate for the court to raise that 

defense sua sponte. And, of course, Plaut versus 

Spendthrift Farm says the same thing. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not generally. Statute 

of limitations, like res judicata, they are 8(c) 

affirmative defenses, and preclusion doctrine is for 

the party to waive or not, just like the statute of 

limitations. I don't think there's any rule that says 

a judge in the run-of-the-mine case acts properly by 

interjecting preclusion into a case where no party has 

raised it. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, our point is 

that it is a matter for the court's discretion. And 

there may well be circumstances where it would be an 

abuse of discretion to interject a timeliness 

objection. For example, if the case had gone on for 

years, and a trial had been held, as Your Honor 

suggested in the question earlier, that might well be 

an abuse of discretion, but it would not -- for 

example, take the case where the District Court had 

dismissed, at the outset, on the merits, and it went 

up to the Court of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals 

said, "You know, that merits issue is a very difficult 

one. And, in fact, we think we might have to remand

for an evidentiary hearing on that issue. But, you 

know, this case was untimely filed. We can dispose of 

it on that basis. And we can save all of those 

judicial and party resources by addressing that issue 

now." We think that would be an appropriate exercise 

of the court's discretion. 

Here, as Your Honor noted earlier, this was 

the first thing that happened in the District Court 

after the filing of the petition, the answer, and the 

reply. There was no waste of judicial resources by 

the fact that it was raised sua sponte by the court in 

the first thing that the court did after that 

briefing. There was no prejudice to the Petitioner, 

because it was omitted from the State's responsive 

pleading. There is -- as the Court said in Granberry, 

the failure to plead it perhaps waives the District --

the State's opportunity to insist on the defense. The 

State, because it said, in its answer here, 

erroneously, that the petition was timely filed, or if 

it had said nothing, would have waived its opportunity 

to stand on, and insist on, that defense. But it is 

not an absolute forfeiture. It does not bar the party 

from suggesting at a later time, "We would like to 

amend," or, in this case, the court to note it sua 

sponte.

 The court did, here, of course, give the 

Petitioner every opportunity --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. From what you 

just said, I take it that means that even when the 

State is unwilling to change its mind and says, "No, 

we would still prefer not to assert the defense," you 

would allow the court to impose it. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: We believe that the 

court is not absolutely limited by the defenses --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The answer --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- asserted by --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- is yes. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Yes. Yes. The 

court is not absolutely limited by the affirmative 

defenses asserted by the State. For -- and that is 

perhaps most easily seen with respect to affirmative 

defenses such as failure to exhaust, nonretroactivity. 

If the court was going to have to assess a brand-new 

constitutional claim that the habeas petitioner --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But with respect to 

some --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- was asserting --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- of those, of 

course, AEDPA specifically promulgates new rules about 

when they're waived, and not. And they -- Congress

hasn't done that with respect to the statute of 

limitations. 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That's right. And 

obviously, as the State suggested, if the State didn't 

want to stand on the statute of limitations defense 

because, for example, it was particularly messy, there 

was going to be a lot of litigation about equitable 

tolling, it would in inappropriate for the court to 

insist on litigating that issue. But if, for example, 

the State said, "Well, you know, if we didn't stand on 

this defense, instead this Petitioner would go back to 

the State Court, and the State's Courts are going to 

be very hospitable to this claim. We think you're 

more likely to deny relief, so we'd rather have it 

litigated here," it would inappropriate for the State 

to try to force the Federal Court to litigate that 

issue instead of the State Court. These are all fact-

specific, case-specific considerations. And that's 

what the Court did in Granberry. It remanded --

after setting aside both extreme positions, it 

remanded to the Court of Appeals for a case-specific 

application of discretion. 

As to the question of whether the Eleventh 

Circuit here believed that there was an absolute 

obligation, I think that it's relevant to note that,

although there was one point at which it said, "The 

court was obligated to enforce the statute of 

limitations" -- and, of course, that's true if the 

State has preserved the defense -- there were three 

other points in the Court of Appeals opinion where it 

used discretionary or nonmandatory language. For 

example, at petition appendix 4(a), the court said 

that the District Court "may dismiss." At the 

petition appendix 5(a), it said that the State's 

failure to raise "does not bar" the court from acting 

sua sponte. Again, at petition appendix 6(a), the 

State's concession, quote, "does not compromise the 

authority of the District Court." All of those are 

phrased in more permissive language --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But, of course, 

"may" is -- "may" is embraced within "must." If you 

"must," you "may." 

[Laughter.] 

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, perhaps the -

- perhaps the even most clear indication of what the 

Court of Appeals viewed this is its citation to 

Jackson as an application of Jackson. And in Jackson 

there is no question, because Jackson said, quote, 

"The District Court possessed the discretion to raise 

sua sponte." And the -- and the magistrate judge, as

the State's counsel, mentioned -- in footnote 1 of its 

opinion, cites that same standard and makes clear that 

it's raising this at a -- as a matter of its 

discretion. So, remand for the exercise of discretion 

would be -- serve no purpose in this case. 

If there are no further questions --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

Mr. Busby, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. BRETT BUSBY 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. BUSBY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

I'd like to begin by addressing the "must" 

versus "may" issue that Counsel discussed. For the 

reasons I mentioned, I think the better reading of the 

Eleventh Circuit's opinion is that there was an 

obligation, and that the most clear indication of that 

is its distinction of Esslinger, which expressly 

applied a Granberry-type analysis. But, even if the 

Court believes that the Eleventh Circuit was only 

saying "may," and that the District Court was only 

saying "may," and recognized the that it had 

discretion -- and there is a footnote in the 

magistrate's opinion that cites to Jackson that says, 

"We have discretion" -- I would submit that if you 

read Jackson, it's a standardless discretion. There

are no factors anywhere in Jackson of the type that 

this Court discussed in Granberry. It -- and there's 

no indication that the -- that the magistrate judge 

considered any of those factors. There's no 

indication that the Eleventh Circuit considered any of 

those factors. And it's certainly an abuse of 

discretion for a court to apply the wrong legal 

standard or fail to consider the relevant factors that 

channel that discretion. 

And so, we -- our position is that, because 

the factors under Rule 15 and the other factors in our 

brief were not applied, that a remand, at a minimum, 

is appropriate in this case. 

Also, I'd like to speak to Granberry and 

Caspari. Again, those involve exhaustion and 

nonretroactivity. And I submit that it's not correct 

to characterize those two doctrines as affirmative 

defenses; rather, the way that Congress codified them 

is on -- as substantive limits on relief, unlike 

"limitations," which it just said "period of 

limitations," which the commonly accepted meaning is 

an "affirmative defense." And so, that makes those 

very different from an affirmative defense, in terms 

of sua sponte consideration. 

Also, both "exhaustion" and

"nonretroactivity" are unique to habeas. They're not 

mentioned anywhere in Rules 8 and 12. Whereas, 

"limitations," of course, is mentioned explicitly. 

And so, our position is that Rule 8 and 12, not 

necessarily always, but at least in all but 

extraordinary cases, would prevent the judge from 

raising this sua sponte. 

Also, I would say that the rules that we 

rely on don't deprive the court of sua sponte 

authority, they channel that authority. Under Rule 4, 

they can plead it, or the court can make a motion to 

dismiss -- ask the -- order the State to make a motion 

to dismiss based on limitations under Habeas Rule 4. 

They can plead it in their answer, under Habeas Rule 5 

and Civil Rules 8 and 12, or they can amend their 

answer, under Civil Rule 15. That's the way the 

drafters of the rules wanted them to do this. And 

Lonchar and Carlisle say they cannot -- that a judge 

cannot use his sua sponte power to circumvent the 

requirements of those rules. 

Finally, I'd like to mention that civil --

the statutes of limitations in civil cases also 

implicate broader social interests. And some of them, 

we've discussed in our brief. And, even more so, 

because there are lots of protections in AEDPA cases

that don't apply in civil cases. There are 

presumptions of correctness and those sorts of things. 

But courts in civil cases, nonetheless, say that 

statutes of limitations can be waived. And the result 

should be no different here. 

Thank you.
