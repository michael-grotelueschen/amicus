 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in No. 09-1227, Bond v. 

United States.

 Mr. Clement.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The standing of Petitioner to challenge the 

constitutionality of the Federal statute under which her 

liberty is being deprived should not be open to serious 

question. She clearly satisfies this Court's modern 

tripartite test for standing. Indeed, it is hard to 

imagine an injury more particularized or concrete than 

six years in Federal prison, and the liberty interest 

she seeks to vindicate is her own, not some third 

party's.

 In many ways, I think "standing" is a bit of 

a misnomer here. Plaintiff is not a plaintiff who seeks 

to invoke the jurisdiction of a Federal court. She is a 

defendant who has been hailed into court by a Federal 

prosecutor. There is no logical reason she should not 

be able to mount a constitutional attack on the statute

that is the basis for the prosecution.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do our -- any of our 

opinions talk about the standing of the defendant? I 

can't think of one at the moment.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think it was in the 

habeas context, but the Spencer decision does talk about 

how, when you have a criminal defendant or somebody who 

is serving a sentence, their standing to challenge the 

conviction is essentially one of the easiest standing 

cases you can imagine. And I think in a sense, the same 

principles would apply here.

 But as I said, I think standing is normally 

something you think about as applying to the plaintiff, 

who is invoking the jurisdiction of the court. So 

what's really at issue here is something -- almost more 

of a bar on somebody's ability to make an argument that 

would vindicate their liberty, and I see no reason why, 

in logic, that should be the case.

 Now, the court of appeals essentially didn't 

apply ordinary -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it seems to me there 

are certainly some arguments you could make as a 

defendant for which you have no standing. You're saying 

there's no argument you can make as a defendant for 

which you have no standing?

MR. CLEMENT: Well, I'm not sure you would 

call it normal standing principles, Your Honor. There 

are certainly arguments you could make that you -- would 

have no business having anything to do with your case. 

There's arguments you could make that would have nothing 

to do with -- would be non-justiciable -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose I raise an 

Establishment Clause objection in a matter that -- that 

does not involve legislation and which our recent 

opinions say therefore does not violate the 

Establishment Clause?

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I guess I would have to 

know why you were a defendant in that case and how it 

had anything to do with the price of tea in that 

particular case. But -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, you wouldn't. All 

you -- all you would have to know is that the claim is 

based upon a statute -- is not based upon a statute and 

that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence says if it's 

not based upon a statute, it doesn't violate the 

Establishment Clause.

 MR. CLEMENT: With respect, I don't think 

that follows. I mean, I think if -- if the Federal 

executive tried to imprison you based on your religion, 

you could take issue with that and say that's an

Establishment Clause violation. The problem in your 

recent case, the Hein case, is the only -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'd say it's a Free 

Exercise Clause violation. I don't think you need the 

Establishment Clause for that.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, if they said, well, 

we're hereby establishing a religion and you're not part 

of our religion and we're therefore imprisoning you, I 

would think you could bring that claim.

 But in all events, bringing it back to the 

case before you, I think there is no reason to think 

that ordinary principles of standing wouldn't give my 

client every ability to challenge the constitutionality 

of the statute under which she's being held.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, in the case 

before us, are you making any claims other than that 

Congress was acting outside its enumerated powers in 

enacting this statute? Are there any peculiarly Tenth 

Amendment claims that you're making?

 In other words, you admit that Congress is 

acting within its enumerated powers and yet the action 

violates the Tenth Amendment. Are you making any claims 

of that sort, or are all your claims that the statute 

here goes beyond Congress's ability to enact it under 

Article I?

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kagan, 

principally our argument here is an enumerated powers 

argument. My problem, though, is I'm not sure I 

understand some clearly defined set of Tenth Amendment 

claims that are uniquely only Tenth Amendment claims and 

not enumerated power claims.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, let's just use the 

Printz case and say, even though Congress might have the 

ability to enact a statute under Article I, there's an 

independent Tenth Amendment limitation. Do you have any 

claims of that kind in this case?

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't think so, but 

let me just say that my problem is -- take the Printz 

case. The Printz case itself went out of its way to say 

that it was an enumerated power case. In answering an 

argument in the dissent, the majority opinion says, this 

is not separate from enumerated powers. If you -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, let's assume, 

Mr. Clement, that there is such a thing as a claim in 

which you're saying, I can see that this is within 

Congress's Article I powers, but there is an independent 

Tenth Amendment limitation on this. Do you have any 

claims like that?

 MR. CLEMENT: I don't think so, Justice 

Kagan, but I'd hate to sort of bet my case that on

remand, I'm not going to say something in making an 

argument that the government or somebody else thinks is 

too much of a commandeering claim and too much -- not 

enough of an enumerated power claim.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The government agrees 

that it's an enumerated power claim in this case.

 MR. CLEMENT: Again, Justice Ginsburg, that 

is the basis of our claim. But just to give you a -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You are -- you are at no 

risk if the Court were just limited to what both of you 

agree is involved -- Article I, Section 8 -- and if 

there is a difference for commandeering claims, when the 

case arises, we can deal with it.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, you 

could certainly do that, and as long as it is crystal 

clear that there will be no obstacle to my client making 

a constitutional attack on section 229 on remand, I 

suppose that's fair enough for my client.

 But one of the arguments we've preserved, 

for example, is the argument that Missouri vs. Holland 

is not a blank check for the government, that it 

requires a balancing of the State's interests against 

the Federal interests. And if on remand, I wax eloquent 

about the State's interest in criminal prosecution and 

law enforcement, I would hate for a trap door to open up

at that point and I be told that, wait, wait, that's too 

much of the State's interest and not enough of your own 

interest.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you want us to say that 

when there is a specific injury, specific to your 

client, that your client has the right to make any 

argument to show that the government has exceeded its 

powers under the Constitution, because those powers are 

limited to protect the liberties of the individual?

 MR. CLEMENT: Exactly right, Justice 

Kennedy, and that's the fundamental worry I have here, 

is that this Court's cases have not drawn a distinction 

between commandeering claims and enumerated powers 

claims. The two cases the government points to, New 

York and Printz, both go out of their way to say that 

they are mirror images or, in fact, enumerated power 

claims, because a law that commandeers is not necessary 

and proper.

 And I do also think that a part of the 

problem with the suggestion that somehow Tennessee 

Electric should be reimagined as a third party standing 

claim is it fundamentally miscomprehends for whom the 

structural provisions of the Constitution are there for. 

Those provisions are there to protect the liberty of 

citizens.

The United -- this Court made that point in 

the Free Enterprise Fund just last term. There was a 

case where it wasn't the executive complaining about the 

infringement on executive power. The Executive Branch 

ably defended the statute in this Court. It was a 

disgruntled accounting firm that was allowed to 

vindicate the separation of powers.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Can't there be some Tenth 

Amendment claims that go just to State prerogatives and 

not to the rights of individuals? Let's say there's a 

Federal statute that purports to regulate where a State 

locates its capital, or the -- the contents of a State 

flag, something like that. Wouldn't that go just to 

State prerogatives and not to individual rights?

 MR. CLEMENT: I think it would, Justice 

Alito. My point is not that there's some special rule 

for the Tenth Amendment that plaintiffs will always have 

standing. My point is that you should just apply the 

normal rules. And what I don't think is sustainable is 

the proposition that in commandeering claims an 

individual never has standing.

 I mean, imagine a Federal statute that 

purported to save Federal money by commandeering local 

prosecutors to prosecute Federal crimes. Well, I would 

hope that a defendant in that kind of case would be able

to raise a commandeering argument as a defense. I don't 

think it would be any different if Congress tried to 

commandeer the Comptroller General to start bringing 

criminal prosecutions. In that case -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, if you are not 

making a commandeering claim, then we would be going out 

of our way to decide that question. And so, you know, 

are you making a commandeering claim?

 MR. CLEMENT: I don't -- I don't 

self-identify as having made a commandeering claim. But 

what I would say is -- we're not asking you to do 

anything special. I just think it's the government 

that's asking you to go out of your way to 

reconceptualize Tennessee Electric as a different kind 

of case and preserve it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the problem is if 

you're just making a treaty power claim, then how are 

you going to possibly win on remand in the Third Circuit 

if we reverse and say that your -- your client has 

standing? Do you think it falls within the prerogatives 

of the court of appeals to say that Missouri v. Holland 

was wrong?

 MR. CLEMENT: Well two things, Justice 

Alito. First, this is a technical matter. We could go 

back to the Third Circuit on our way back to coming here

and we would still have standing to make an argument 

that it's foreclosed by precedent.

 But I think it's a mistake to think that 

Missouri v. Holland is some bright-line rule that 

forever answers this question. As I read Missouri v. 

Holland and as we clearly argued before the Third 

Circuit, it's not a blank check. It's really is more of 

a balancing test that looks at the State's interest and 

the Federal interest in assessing whether or not the 

statute that implements the treaty is necessary and 

proper. And I think this case compares pretty favorably 

with Missouri against Holland because there the state's 

interests was very weak because these birds were just 

flying through on their way and there was no real State 

interest, or so this Court held, whereas in this case 

the State has a real legitimate interest in law 

enforcement. I also think we ought to be able to make 

JUSTICE ALITO: Does that depend on the 

nature of the chemical that's involved? Suppose the 

chemical was -- was something that people would normally 

understand as the kind of chemical that would be used in 

a chemical weapon? Let's say it's Sarin does it matter 

that this case doesn't involve something like that?

 MR. CLEMENT: I think it does, Justice

Alito. I think it would matter in part for a 

constitutional avoidance statutory construction 

argument, which I think also ought to be open to us. 

sort of think by analogy to the Jones case, where this 

Court said that a Federal statute about arson doesn't 

apply when a cousin throws a Molotov cocktail at a 

residence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's a merits 

question rather than a standing question. I assume 

we're not getting into those merits questions here.

 MR. CLEMENT: No, I was trying to respond to 

the question of whether we would be foreclosed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. But you're 

confusing me. I thought we were just doing standing.

 MR. CLEMENT: No, we're not asking you to do 

more than do standing. But I do think it's important to 

understand that we don't think we would be limited to 

just losing on Missouri v. Holland below and coming back 

up. We think we have a very good argument about 

Missouri v. Holland as applied.

 We also think that there is sort of a 

statutory construction argument. And this isn't sarin. 

There is something sort of odd about the government's 

theory that says that I can buy a chemical weapon at 

Amazon.com. That strikes me as odd, and that seems to

me the kind of thing where you could make a statutory 

construction to say, well, maybe sarin or maybe actual 

chemical weapons, that's one thing, but with respect to 

this kind of commonly available chemical, to say without 

any jurisdictional element or anything like that, that 

it's a Federal crime seems like an argument we at least 

ought to have standing to make.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you say about the 

one thing -- the strongest point against you, I think, 

is a single sentence in that TVA case. It's only one 

sentence, but it's there in the opinion, and I think 

what it's saying, Justice Roberts says, well, he already 

finished, he just finished saying nobody -- Congress 

hasn't violated some rule against creating a system of 

regulation in this statute because it isn't regulation. 

But then he said, but even if it were, even if it were, 

and if your complaint was that Congress has acted 

outside its authority, which they might have thought at 

that time, in creating a system, TVA, that competes with 

local systems, even if that were so, the appellants, 

absent the State or their officers, would have no 

standing in this suit to raise the question.

 Okay, now, that -- they put quite a lot on 

to that. That is what it says. So are we supposed to 

say, well, that was an ill-considered dicta? Or are we

supposed to say it was just wrong? Are we supposed to 

say the law has changed? What in your view are we 

supposed to -- or is different. What in your view are 

we supposed to say?

 MR. CLEMENT: Could I say two things about 

that sentence, and then explain what I really think you 

should say? First of all, the first thing I would say 

about that sentence is that I don't think, read in the 

context of the entire opinion, it actually means that 

the Court is trying to impose a special disability on 

Tenth Amendment claims, because remember, they have 

already rejected the plaintiff's basis for having 

standing.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So it comes out of left 

field, and it's an overall "any, even, if." So that 

suggests it's just dicta and doesn't count.

 MR. CLEMENT: And it's dictum in another 

way. But what I think it stands for is the proposition 

-- it rejects the argument that if you don't otherwise 

have standing under the governing standing rule of the 

day that you somehow have a license to bring a Tenth 

Amendment claim. And if that's what it stands, well, it 

was right then and it continues to be right.

 A second point to make about it is it is 

dictum, and if you read the sentence, what it says is

the following: It makes a reference to what it's 

already established a couple of paragraphs earlier, 

which is the states at issue here have passed laws to 

accommodate TVA's sale of power, and then it goes on to 

say, if this were not so. What does that -- that is a 

counterfactual hypothetical. It's the worst kind of 

dictum. It says if this were not so. If it were not 

the fact that the States had already taken these actions 

to affirmatively accommodate then we would have a 

different question and then there wouldn't be standing. 

So it is dictum I think and can be disregarded as such.

 But really if you ask me what you should do 

with it, you should do what you did in Twombly, with 

some language in an opinion that had continued to cause 

trouble in the 50 years since. You should just say 

that's no longer good law because it's not. The central 

holding of Tennessee Electric was overruled 40 years ago 

in the Camp case, and I think this language is of a 

piece from that legal interest test, the legal wrong 

test of standing, and I think this Court should make 

clear that it doesn't apply any longer, and the virtue 

of that would be that it would free up the lower courts 

to decide these Tenth Amendment standing claims based on 

an application of normal standing principles, because 

that's not happening in the lower court right now. In

the lower court right now what happens is somebody comes 

in with a Tenth Amendment claim of whatever stripe, 

maybe it's a commandeering claim, maybe it's not, and 

what they're confronted with, especially if it's a 

commandeering claim, is a quick citation of Tennessee 

Electric, an equally quick citation of Shearson which 

says only this Court can overturn its decisions, and 

that's it. No standing analysis, nothing subtle about 

the particular claim. And that's not a sustainable 

situation.

 MR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 As Petitioner confirmed this morning, the 

central claim that he is making about the 

unconstitutionality of section 229 is that it exceeds 

Congress's enumerated powers. He may wish to raise as 

part of that claim a argument that it invades the 

province that belongs to the States concerning criminal 

law. He can do that. He has the authority to make such

a challenge. The Third Circuit erred in holding to the 

contrary.

 Now, the Third Circuit in reaching the 

contrary conclusion relied on this Court's decision in 

Tennessee Electric v. TVA, and we think that the court 

of appeals misread that case in concluding that it 

barred standing, not because it lacks a holding that 

does bar standing of certain types of claims that allege 

an invasion of State sovereignty, but because the kind 

of claim that Petitioner is making is not a Tenth 

Amendment reserved rights claim, but instead an 

enumerated powers claim.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of hard 

under our precedents to draw that precise line between 

enumerated powers and the Tenth Amendment, and it seems 

a bit much to put defendant to the trouble of trying to 

do that under the theory from TVA that they have no 

standing to make a particular type of Tenth Amendment 

claim.

 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, I don't 

think that the defendant needs to be put in any trouble 

in this case because the kind of claim that counsel is 

making on her behalf does assert her right not to be 

subject to criminal punishment under a law that he says, 

counsel says, Congress lacks the authority to enact.

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if they argue -­

what if she argues on remand, if there is a remand, 

that, assuming for the sake of argument Congress can 

enact any law that is necessary and proper to implement 

a treaty? The Tenth Amendment prohibits certain laws 

that intrude too heavily on State law enforcement 

prerogatives, State police power. If she makes that 

argument, which category does that fall into?

 MR. DREEBEN: It falls into the enumerated 

powers category, Justice Alito, just as last term in 

United States v. Comstock one of the elements that this 

Court looked at when it decided whether the law 

authorizing civil commitment in that case was within 

Congress's enumerated authority plus the Necessary and 

Proper Clause, the Court looked at the extent to which 

the law accommodated State interests or, alternatively, 

invaded them in an unlawful manner, which is what Mr. 

Comstock had alleged in that case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're -- you want us 

to say that, even if the defendant in some case might 

show that a constitutional violation is causing that 

defendant specific injury, the defendant may not be able 

to raise the claim of its, what you call sovereignty 

claim? In Thornton v. Arkansas, the term limits case, 

we allowed a citizen of a State to bring a challenge to

a statute that the State had enacted inconsistent with 

its Federal powers. Now, that's the flip side. That 

was a State statute, not a Federal statute, but it seems 

to me that is inconsistent with the position you're 

taking. And it seems to me also consistent -­

inconsistent with the rule that separation of powers 

claims can be presented by defendants, in Chadha v. 

INS, Clinton v. New York, a line-item veto case.

 The whole point of separation of powers, the 

whole point of federalism, is that it inheres to the 

individual and his or her right to liberty; and if that 

is infringed by a criminal conviction or in any other 

way that causes specific injury, why can't it be raised? 

I just don't understand your point.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Kennedy, I -- I 

don't take issue with almost everything that you said. 

The structural protections of the Constitution can be 

enforced by individuals under the cases that you have 

cited.

 What we are dealing with here is two things. 

First of all, a statement that this Court made in TVA 

that was part of its holding, addressed to what the 

Court perceived as an attack based on a specific aspect 

of State sovereignty that belonged to the States. Now, 

today, we might not understand the claim that was made

in that case as implicating a specific sovereign right 

that's protected under the Tenth Amendment. Today we 

might look at it and say this is nothing other than a 

conventional preemption claim.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I don't know whether that's 

a correct characterization of the argument that was made 

in -- in the Tennessee Electric case. I -- I'm looking 

at the brief in the case, and the discussion of the 

Tenth Amendment generally follows a caption that says 

the power to dispose of Federal property does not 

include any power to regulate local activities.

 I don't understand why that isn't the same 

kind of delegated powers argument that you say the 

Petitioner here is raising.

 MR. DREEBEN: That may be, Justice Alito. 

think that it's a little bit difficult to parse 

precisely what the Petitioner in Tennessee Electric was 

arguing, but this Court understood the claim as one that 

-- that bore on Federal regulation of purely local 

matters in a matter that regulated the internal affairs 

of the State; and I agree with you that today we might 

not view that as a Tenth Amendment-specific claim, but 

this Court did in 1939.

presence or absence of a State objection mattered, the 

Court said: As we've seen there's no objection from the 

State, and if this were not so the appellants, absent 

the States or their officers, have no standing to raise 

any objection under the amendment.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's assume in this 

hypothetical -- just that case, TVA. State -- the 

Federal Government sets the price, and someone's accused 

of violating that price. Can that defendant come in and 

say, just as in TVA, that's unconstitutional because 

prices have to be set by the State? Can the defendant 

say that, or is that an anti- commandeering claim that 

you say they're barred from raising?

 MR. DREEBEN: That is not an anti­

commandeering claim. That is the kind of claim that 

today we would conceptualize as an enumerated powers 

claim.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So my question goes back 

to one that's been asked before, which is, give me a 

hypothetical of a defendant who has been convicted where 

it would be a pure anti- commandeering claim that you 

say they have no standing for.

commandeering case from what Justice Kennedy was talking 

about. And the point is best made in the context of an 

example. Under the Sex Offender Registration Act, 

defendants have challenged the law on numerous grounds, 

including, number one, Congress lacks its constitutional 

authority under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary 

and Proper Clause to criminalize the individual 

registration requirement imposed on them. All courts 

that have addressed that have said that's a claim that's 

within the cognizance of a defendant to bring.

 Defendants have also said the SORNA statute 

violates Federal law because it requires States to 

accept sex offender registrations. It commandeers the 

States into requiring them to set up a sex offender 

database.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Dreeben, why 

shouldn't the defendant be able to raise that argument? 

If the defendant prevails on that argument, presumably 

the statute is invalidated and the conviction is 

overthrown. So why doesn't the defendant have the 

appropriate interest to raise that argument?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Kagan, this is 

the absolutely crucial point that distinguishes 

commandeering from most of the structural constitutional 

provisions that we've been discussing this morning. A

State can choose to establish a sex offender database 

and to receive registrations from people who are 

required to register under Federal law; and invalidating 

a Federal law that commanded them to do that does not 

deprive the State of its ability to say, we want to 

have, in our autonomous sovereign interest, a sex 

offender database that will receive these applications, 

and as a result -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, all you're saying is 

that there's -- in that hypothetical is that there's no 

violation?

 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Everybody goes home.

 MR. DREEBEN: There -- the reason why in 

that hypothetical the defendant should not raise the 

issue is because there will be no violation -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: But that's a merits 

question. That's not a standing question. Why don't we 

just say the defendant has standing to raise it, and 

then he'll lose?

 MR. DREEBEN: You could say that, Justice 

Kagan, but I think that part of the enduring force of 

TVA is that it adopted a third-party standing rule that 

is still part of this Court's jurisprudence.

said the same thing in TVA, that, while companies are -­

are -- not -- yes, the Federal -- the Federal statute 

requires the companies to charge this price, but they 

might have decided to charge it on their own anyway, and 

therefore you have no standing?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the Court did say that 

there was no standing on the grounds that when the 

specific argument was made, this takes away the right of 

the State to regulate because the Federal Government is 

regulating.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, is your 

concern that there would be a clash in these cases? 

You've given the example of the State wants to have this 

registration system. Suppose the -- the defendant can 

raise that and would prevail? Well, the State's not 

party to that suit, its interests have not been 

represented. Is that -- is that your concern?

 MR. DREEBEN: That is a major factor in 

third-party standing generally, Justice Ginsburg.

be commandeered in Printz? Suppose they said, we really 

like having sheriffs take the Federal gun registration

Federal Government than the Constitution does?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Kennedy. But a 

State in its sovereign decisionmaking process can elect 

to participate in a Federal program. At least, that was 

what Justice O'Connor said in her concurrence in Printz.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't standard standing 

doctrine able to give you the protection that you're 

looking after? If indeed you can't tell whether the 

State did it because it was compelled to or because it 

wanted to, there was no causation and you don't have 

standing.

route of analysis.

route of analysis than inventing the new one that you're

MR. DREEBEN: I think, Justice Scalia, that 

all the Government is doing in this case is applying 

conventional standing principles of redressability and 

third-party standing in a specific context, which as Mr. 

Clement has made clear, is not before the Court today. 

This is not a commandeering case. That happens to be 

the only specific aspect of a State sovereignty claim 

that is distinct from an enumerated powers claim that 

the Court has recognized in recent decades. Whether 

some other sort of claim of State sovereignty might some 

day be recognized and require its own analysis is well 

beyond the scope of this case. Our point is a much more 

basic one. We agree with Petitioner's counsel that he 

can raise the claim that he has tried to raise. We 

think that the Third Circuit misunderstood what the TVA 

decision purported to say when it rejected standing for 

a type of State sovereignty claim. And we think that 

the currently recognized State sovereignty claim of 

commandeering fits into the description of the 

analytical category that was addressed in TVA.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that analysis 

differ in any way because this is a treaty power claim 

versus a Commerce Clause claim? Your briefs go back and 

forth on which one it is. Your reply brief now 

emphasizes Commerce Clause power, but your main brief

was saying this is a treaty provision challenge. Do 

they differ?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I 

believe that the statute is valid under either the 

Treaty Clause plus the Necessary and Proper Clause 

analysis under Missouri v. Holland. It also can be 

sustained in our view under the Commerce Clause, which 

follows directly from what this Court said in Raich when 

the Court said that the intrastate regulation of a 

commodity that's used in commerce is a customary, 

typical method that Congress utilizes. It gave as 

examples of that the nuclear, biological, and plastic 

explosives statutes which were enacted to implement 

treaty obligations of the United States.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Given the breadth of this 

statute, that would be a very far-reaching decision, 

wouldn't it? Suppose that the Petitioner in this case 

decided to retaliate against her former friend by 

pouring a bottle of vinegar in the friend's goldfish 

bowl. As I read this statute, that would be a violation 

of this statute, potentially punishable by life 

imprisonment, wouldn't it?

 MR. DREEBEN: I'm not sure, Justice Alito. 

I will assume with you that it is. The statute -­

weapon.

 MR. DREEBEN: I'm not sure that vinegar is a 

chemical weapon.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, a chemical weapon is a 

weapon that includes toxic chemicals. And a toxic 

chemical is a chemical that can cause death to animals. 

And pouring vinegar in a goldfish bowl, I believe, will 

cause death to the goldfish, so that's -- that's a 

chemical weapon.

 MR. DREEBEN: I'm willing to make the 

assumption with you and accept that it is a 

broad-reaching statute, but it was adopted as a 

broad-reaching statute because this is an area, like the 

medical marijuana instance in Raich, where effective 

control of the interstate market requires control of an 

intrastate market. The statute exempts peaceful uses 

for agricultural and pharmaceutical purposes of these 

chemicals, it has other exemptions as well. It was 

intended to be a comprehensive ban that implemented the 

United States treaty obligations to eliminate the use of 

chemical weapons both in military instances and in 

terrorism, and -­

JUSTICE ALITO: The difference is that Raich 

involved one commodity, right? Marijuana. This 

involves potentially thousands and thousands of

chemicals. And you would have -- you would make the 

same argument with respect to every one of those 

chemicals if you take together all of the people who are 

-- who would use vinegar to kill goldfish or all the 

people who might use antifreeze to kill dogs, you put 

all of that together, that has a substantial effect on 

the interstate, the interstate market for antifreeze or 

for vinegar? That would be the argument?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think it's pretty well 

recognized, Justice Alito, that when Congress seeks to 

regulate an interstate market as to which there cannot 

be any question under the Commerce Clause Congress could 

do, it can control the interstate market as necessary in 

order to assure that its prohibition is effective.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're trying to drive 

vinegar out of the interstate market? Do the people 

know you're trying to do this? Can you really argue 

that this statute is designed to drive vinegar out of 

the interstate market?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, of course not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, are we 

getting to the merits of the case?

 MR. DREEBEN: A lot further than I had 

intended, Justice Ginsburg. The merits of the case, 

though, involve both a Commerce Clause argument, a

treaty-based argument. As far as the standing 

principles go, I don't think that there is any 

difference between them. Missouri v. Holland was a case 

in which this Court adjudicated whether a law exceeded 

Congress's enumerated authority. It did that at the 

behest of a State, but there is no reason why under 

cases like Lopez and Sabri and Perez that an enumerated 

powers argument is in any way off limits to a criminal 

defendant. It's not.

 If this case does go back down to the Third 

Circuit, a petitioner can make the argument that this 

law exceeds the enumerated powers. We can rely on the 

Treaty Clause. It doesn't affect standing in any way. 

I think that the amicus in support of the judgment makes 

the assumption that because Missouri v. Holland is good 

law, there's no possible claim that Petitioner can make 

that the law would exceed Congress's enumerated 

authority. Therefore, the amicus says this must be some 

sort of a special State sovereignty claim of a genre 

that looks like commandeering, perhaps not articulated 

quite light that.

 We don't understand Petitioner to be making 

that argument. I think Petitioner confirmed today 

that's not what she's trying to do, and there is no 

Tenth Amendment claim based on a specific aspect of

State sovereignty that Petitioner has ever made. In 

fact, if you look at Petitioner's brief in support of 

the rehearing petition, Petitioner said the Tenth 

Amendment argument raised by Bond was not critical to 

Bond's other constitutional challenges. It is ancillary 

to Bond's main argument that Congress acted outside of 

its enumerated powers. I think that's a correct 

understanding of what Petitioner has sought to argue in 

the court below. In our view, she is entitled to make 

that argument. That argument should also fail on the 

merits, but that is not an issue that this Court granted 

certiorari to decide.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the category that you 

would like to have saved, you said commandeering, but 

you said there conceivably could be others. Is there 

anything concrete, anything other than commandeering, 

that might fall under this State sovereignty side of the 

line?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, as Justice Alito pointed 

out, the Court has indicated that moving a State 

capital, a direction to move the State capital, might be 

an intrusion on sovereignty.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Unlikely to come up as a 

defense in a criminal case.

 MR. DREEBEN: Highly unlikely.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF

 JUDGEMENT BELOW

 MR. McALLISTER: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The relevant standing doctrine in this case 

is the prudential rule against third-party standing. No 

one disputes here that the Petitioner has Article III 

standing. One of the difficulties in the case is that 

the only case that mentions specifically standing in 

this context is the Tennessee Valley Authority case and 

it clearly says if it is in fact a Tenth Amendment 

claim, unless you have a State official or the State, 

there is no standing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Pretty harsh, if 

we're talking about prudential standing, to deny that to 

a criminal defendant, isn't it?

 MR. McALLISTER: It's potentially harsh, 

Your Honor, but there are lower court cases that have 

certainly done it. There is some circuit cases where a 

criminal defendant has tried to make a Tenth Amendment

claim and the court has said no. She still has several 

other claims here. We all agree, I think, to the extent 

you could really characterize her claim as an Article I 

enumerated powers claim, this Court has assumed many 

times that defendants have the standing. This Court 

generally has not discussed it, but it has assumed it, 

and so there are cases that say no standing for a 

criminal defendant. She did make a Fifth Amendment due 

process vagueness challenge. If she had other Bill of 

Rights type claims. Even the treaty power cases like 

Reid v. Covert recognize you could raise that kind of 

claim, but the Court's cases do distinguish between 

Tenth Amendment and other claims. And a lot of the 

argument here is about what is on the Tenth Amendment 

side of the line, what is a lack of power, for a better 

word, whether it's -- there's an Article I, power 

doesn't reach it. And in particular I would point to 

the Heller case, which Petitioner mentions in her reply 

brief, but frankly is off by one page in the citation 

that the Court should focus on, pages 579 to '80. The 

Court says "there are three times in the Constitution 

where the word "the people" is not talking about 

individual rights. And the three examples the Court 

gives are the Preamble, Article 1, Section 2, and the 

Tenth Amendment. And the Court says these provisions

are about reservations of power, not rights. And also 

the Printz and the New York v. United States cases say 

there is something substantive about the Tenth Amendment 

that is a limit separate and apart from Article , 

Section 8.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. What do you 

see specifically? Because there's a lot of discussion 

about labels and what the labels mean in this case. But 

tell me specifically what -- not the word she uses, but 

the specific ways in which prudential considerations bar 

her standing; meaning: What about the nature of her 

claim prudentially should counsel us against giving her 

standing?

 MR. McALLISTER: Well, I would say at least 

a couple things, Your Honor. One is, the usual rule of 

prudential third-party standing considers the alignment 

or lack of alignment between the interests of the third 

party making the claim and the party who is not present 

whose claim it really is. And in this case, there's 

really no argument that her interests align with those 

of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Commonwealth 

in fact prosecuted her and it did not stop her. It was 

unsuccessful as a deterrent. And later, when local 

police wouldn't be involved, the Federal Government got 

involved. And -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think 

Pennsylvania would be upset that the Federal Government 

got her when they couldn't?

 MR. McALLISTER: No, that's my point. And 

so my point is that her interests are directly contrary 

to Pennsylvania's interests. So she's not stepping in 

saying: I share the interests of the State; therefore, 

let me articulate and argue the interests of the State.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, in a -- in another 

case, conceivably, the State Attorney General can 

exercise his or her prosecutorial discretion not to -­

not to prosecute this woman, or at least not to 

prosecute her under the antiterrorism law that gives her 

8 years. Isn't that something for the State to be 

concerned about? We want to have the discretion of 

whether to prosecute or not for standard crimes that 

have no relation to interstate commerce or any other 

Federal power.

 MR. McALLISTER: Well, it's standard that 

both sovereigns have the ability often to prosecute if 

the definitions of crimes overlap, and there's nothing 

that prevents Pennsylvania from prosecuting her again 

here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: She wants to make the 

argument that the definitions don't overlap. She wants

to make the argument that this is a strictly State, 

local crime, and that any -- any attempt by the Federal 

Government to convert it into a treaty-based terrorism 

crime is -- is erroneous.

 MR. McALLISTER: Well, in -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what she's trying to 

do. Why doesn't she have standing to make that 

argument?

 MR. McALLISTER: Because the lower courts, 

at least, in their defense, understood this to be a 

Tenth Amendment claim, and there are reasons for that. 

Now, in this Court neither the Petitioner nor the 

government really wants to talk about that or argue 

about that. Instead, they talk about the petition for 

rehearing en banc after the Third Circuit has decided 

the case.

 But if you look in the Joint Appendix, pages 

26 to 32 is the supplemental brief that her lawyer filed 

when the Third Circuit said, post-argument: Now, wait a 

minute, maybe this is a Tenth Amendment case and we have 

a standing issue. The government, at that point, said: 

Hey, good idea; we don't think she does have standing.

 And she did not come back and answer: I'm 

not making a Tenth Amendment claim. Her answer is: I'm 

making a Tenth Amendment claim, but I have standing to

make it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That single sentence 

doesn't seem -- I'm trying to figure it out. It doesn't 

seem to refer to just all Tenth Amendment claims. 

There's a footnote and it talks about no standing in 

this suit.

 Then if you look back at the lower court 

case, it seemed to be referring to a particular argument 

where the challengers had said the Property Clause 

doesn't give authority to the government to pass this. 

The reply was, that was true in Alabama, and the Court 

said it was okay. Then the challengers say: Oh, but 

Alabama agreed. And then Georgia doesn't agree. And it 

was in that context that Georgia says it doesn't make 

any difference.

 But if Georgia was going to disagree or 

agree, if that's what it turned on, we better have 

Georgia say whether they agree or disagree, and not have 

people who aren't Georgia. That's what he seems to be 

saying to me at the moment.

 If I'm right, what's comparable to that in 

this case? Is there some claim that she's making that 

it would be constitutional if they agreed in the State 

and it wouldn't be if not? I don't think so. I think 

she means it's constitutional irrespective.

MR. McALLISTER: As a -- I mean, she's 

arguing a lack of power. So -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Yes. So if that's 

so, then how can we take this sentence as barred?

 MR. McALLISTER: Well, I think, again, the 

sentence -- I mean, if we're talking about the sentence 

in TVA barring standing in Tenth Amendment claims -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. It just says "in this 

case."

 MR. McALLISTER: It says "in this case," but 

there's no suggestion that it will -- frankly, it's hard 

for us to even tell exactly what this case was in terms 

of the facts. It's a rather confusing case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, he cites. He gives a 

footnote and you read the page and you get an idea.

 MR. McALLISTER: For that particular 

instance -- and that's certainly an example the Court 

had in mind. The language of TVA, though, is in no way 

limited to that particular instance. It just says here, 

there's -- if this is a Tenth Amendment claim, there is 

no standing. And that's why, I think, for 70 years the 

lower courts have wrestled with, what is a Tenth 

Amendment claim? Because TVA is there, this Court has 

announced it, and if it is a Tenth Amendment claim, 

there is no standing.

Sort of back to Justice Sotomayor's 

question, though, in terms of the third-party prudential 

aspect of it, again, the issue is: Is this person a 

good person to assert someone else's interests? Yes, 

she has Article III standing, but not necessarily to 

make every constitutional claim one might think of. In 

the Tenth Amendment context, those claims belong to the 

States. They don't create individual rights. And in 

fact, there's good reason to think the States do get 

involved when they perceive actual Tenth Amendment 

violations.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you just 

articulate for me -- we're speaking in generalities -­

what in the nature of her claim, taking the labels away, 

do you think is a pure Tenth Amendment challenge?

 MR. McALLISTER: Well, that's -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: As I read her complaint, 

and it's always that it's a Tenth Amendment claim 

because Congress and the president have exceeded their 

powers in some -­

MR. McALLISTER: As I understand her 

complaint, basically her argument is that unless this 

statute is authorized by something in Article I, 

section 8, the first 17 clauses, there's no power to 

enact it. And that's why this case is, frankly, not

clearly governed by Lopez or Raich or Morrison. Those 

were straight commerce power cases under section 3. 

This is a treaty power case under Article II, and she 

only wants to read the first half of the Necessary and 

Proper Clause, which refers to all the foregoing powers. 

But it also says necessary and proper for all other 

powers.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -- you haven't 

answered my -- my question. Why isn't that a merits 

decision as to whether or not the President and Congress 

have the power to enact this legislation?

 MR. McALLISTER: Well, Your Honor, in 

essence, at the end of the day, it will be a merits 

question, but from a standing argument, trying to define 

what is a Tenth Amendment claim -- and the point I was 

trying to make, perhaps not successfully, is that she's 

not saying -- well, she is sort of saying the Article I, 

section 8 enumerated powers are the limits. But 

frankly, they can't be the limits.

 In light of the plain language of the 

Necessary and Proper Clause and Missouri v. Holland and 

90 years of this Court's precedent under the treaty 

power, those powers are not limits. So she's asserting 

they're limits and saying, I'm really making an Article 

I claim, but that simply lets her always have standing,

because, even in the commandeering cases, the plaintiff 

can say, this is about Article I, this is not about the 

Tenth Amendment. And so at some point the Court has to 

drill down and characterize what the nature of the claim 

actually is.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why do we have 

to do that? It -- it seems to me we've had a lot of 

discussion this morning about whether this is an 

enumerated powers claim or a Tenth Amendment claim. 

They really do kind of blend together, and it seems to 

me awfully difficult to put on a criminal defendant the 

responsibility to decide whether this is going to be an 

enumerated powers claim or this is going to be a Tenth 

Amendment claim. The basic principles do kind of merge 

together, and why does it make -- again, why does it 

make that much of a difference and why do you put the 

burden on the defendant to parse the claim one way or 

another, since I assume they can make pretty much all 

the same arguments under an enumerated powers -- under 

the enumerated powers clause -­

MR. McALLISTER: Well -­

powers argument.

 MR. McALLISTER: In an enumerated powers 

case, yes. The problem -- I think the difficulty with

this case is it's unusual and that there -- until its 

reply brief in this Court, the government had not relied 

on the commerce power. In fact, the government had said 

throughout: This is a treaty power case, treaty power 

case. Even at the oral argument in the Third Circuit, 

the judge said, couldn't we decide this on the basis of 

the treaty power? Wouldn't -- or the commerce power -­

would not that be the easy route? And the government 

lawyer said, no, that would be the hard route; you need 

to decide it on the basis of the treaty power.

 So I agree in a Lopez kind of case that, 

really, that's where the Court has often said it's just 

mirror image. If the commerce power doesn't go that 

far, then by definition it's reserved under the Tenth 

Amendment. But here, it's a treaty power case. It's 

not an Article I, section 8 -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. McAllister, I guess I 

don't understand why that makes a difference. The 

Necessary and Proper Clause says "foregoing powers" and 

it says "other powers." This happens to be a case where 

Congress is acting under the other powers part of the 

Necessary and Proper Clause, but the question in either 

event is the extent of the Necessary and Proper Clause 

and what it allows Congress to do.

 So in -- in that sense, whether it's a

treaty power case or not a treaty power case just 

doesn't matter. It's all a question of what Congress's 

scope of authority is under the Necessary and Proper 

Clause.

 MR. McALLISTER: Well, I would disagree 

somewhat, Your Honor, respectfully, that -- her argument 

about the Necessary and Proper Clause I don't think is 

that this -- this -- she's not arguing the statute is an 

irrational or unreasonable way to implement the treaty 

obligations of the United States. What she's arguing is 

that the treaty power itself does not give Congress the 

power to enact section 229 unless, in essence, you don't 

need the treaty, because you already have the power, the 

government does, under the first 17 clauses of Article 

I, Section 8.

 So, yes, the Necessary and Proper Clause is 

the connection here to Article I, Section 8, but it's a 

minimal connection, and -- and she's not arguing sort of 

the -- - the -- I don't think, the Comstock kind of 

argument that this isn't tied to, rationally, to some 

sort of articulated power.

 The government clearly has power to enter 

treaties under Article II, section 2, and so that to me 

is the distinguishing feature from all those other 

Article I, section 8, cases. This -- I agree; I don't

think I could stand up here and -- and try to argue to 

you this is a true Tenth Amendment case if, in fact, 

this had been litigated as a commerce power case all 

along.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm not sure I -- I'm not 

sure I understood what you just said. Are you saying 

that -- that she is arguing that Congress does not have 

the power to enact legislation that's necessary and 

proper for the implementation of treaties, but only for 

the making of treaties; that she's making that argument 

that's been made by some academic writers?

 MR. McALLISTER: No, I'm not sure that's 

what I meant to say, Justice Alito. What -- what I was 

trying to say is her argument is not -- well, I think 

her argument is in essence a challenge to the treaty 

power. It's one step removed, but it is a challenge to 

the treaty power, because she says the statute has to be 

based on something in Article I, section 8, first 17 

clauses; and if it's based on something there, then the 

treaty power adds nothing to Congress's ability to enact 

legislation; and that's inconsistent with the plain 

language of the Necessary and Proper Clause, the fact 

that the treaty power is in Article II, not in Article 

I, section 8.

 And so under her view of the world -- as I

understand it; I'm sure Mr. Clement will correct me if 

I'm wrong about my understanding -- is that really you 

don't need a treaty, the treaty doesn't add anything. 

mean, it may be the reason that Congress decides at this 

point in time to enact section 229. But I believe, as I 

understood her argument, if it has the commerce power to 

do it, United States never entered -- needed to enter a 

treaty in order for Congress to enact section 229. So 

in other words, as I understand her argument, the treaty 

power adds nothing to the domestic legislative authority 

of Congress.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McAllister, have you 

found any case other than this one where a criminal 

defendant was held to have lacked standing to challenge 

a statute under which the defendant was prosecuted?

 MR. McALLISTER: Not in this Court, Justice 

Ginsburg, but there are examples in the circuits, a few. 

There are examples from the Eighth Circuit, from the 

Tenth Circuit involving criminal prosecutions where the 

Court characterized the claim as a Tenth Amendment claim 

and said, in light of TVA, the criminal defendant does 

not have standing to make that claim. So there are 

examples in the lower courts. I'm not aware of an 

example in this Court.

 And I would say this, too, about the -­

there's some argument about the separation of powers 

cases in which the Court has typically allowed 

individuals to make that claim. Again, because we're 

talking about prudential rules and third-party standing, 

or at least I'm talking about that, one prudential 

consideration is in those cases, whether it's Chadha, 

whether it's Clinton v. New York, the recent Free 

Enterprise case, the Federal Government is always very 

much present. It may be representing the defendant in 

those cases, it may simply intervene or come in as an 

amicus, it gets notice if the Federal statute is 

challenged as being unconstitutional.

 The difference in the Tenth Amendment 

setting is there's no mechanism, practically, to notify 

the States or solicit the States for their interests. 

Someone's raising this claim that says the government is 

intruding on your sovereign interests; there's no 

mechanism to allow the States. Now, if -- if States are 

aware of it and come and ask to file an amicus, perhaps 

they would be allowed to, but there's no mechanism that 

ensures -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that an issue for 

a civil lawsuit as opposed to a criminal one? Because 

all that would happen in a criminal suit is that the 

defendant's conviction would be undone, but that doesn't

mean that the State is bound in some way. The State 

wasn't a party to the criminal action.

 MR. McALLISTER: Well, the State isn't a 

party, but what gets said in those cases about the scope 

of the State's prerogatives vis-à-vis the Federal 

Government could well be brought to bear in other cases 

in other settings, commandeering cases.

 Again, the concern in the third-party 

standing case is that you're not actually a party, but 

someone else is making arguments in a sense on your 

behalf. They lose, because perhaps they don't know all 

of the arguments they should be making or they don't 

articulate them the way the State does -- there's still 

stare decisis effect of those decisions on the States.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there's two things 

that could happen. One is that if the State loses, then 

-- and it doesn't want to lose -- it passes its own law. 

Or if it wins, if the case is as stated below, it just 

lets the status quo go. I still don't understand what 

the long-term injury to the State is or could be.

 MR. McALLISTER: Well, I guess again, and 

maybe I'm misapprehending, but the long-term interest is 

a -- is a decision, say in the criminal case, that says, 

no, this doesn't intrude on the State's sovereignty, is 

there as a matter of stare decisis. So if in a later

case the State wants to in fact assert that this 

particular statute does intrude on our sovereignty, it's 

not that they can't necessarily raise the claim, but 

they will confront contrary precedent that the State 

never had a chance to -- to voice its opinion or its 

views at the time the issue was being adjudicated.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your underlying premise is 

that the individual has no interest in whether or not 

the State has surrendered its powers to the Federal 

Government, and I just don't think the Constitution was 

framed on that theory.

 MR. McALLISTER: Well, Justice Kennedy, I 

don't know that I would say they have no interest, but I 

am -- I guess the premise I'm asserting is they do not 

necessarily get to assert the Tenth Amendment claim of 

the States. New York v. United States, for example, was 

a case where the State initially said we're not 

concerned about this regulation, and then changed its 

mind; and the Court in New York said States don't waive 

those Tenth Amendment rights; States can then -- can 

change its mind and bring a suit, and there's no 

indication -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it does -- it does 

assume, as Justice Kennedy said, that the reason that is 

there in the Constitution is only for the benefits of

the States, and not for the benefit of the people in the 

States. So if a State chooses to give it away, the -­

the individual has -- has no standing. You say it's 

third party, we're raising the States' rights. I think 

what the other sides is arguing; this is not a right of 

the States, it's a right of the individual to have the 

State take charge of certain matters and the Federal 

Government take charge of other matters. I don't see 

why that's any different from an Article I, section 8 

claim.

 MR. McALLISTER: Well, and that's a 

conclusion the Court can reach. But what -- what the 

Petitioner's position essentially holds is that there's 

never a question of third-party standing for any claim 

under the Constitution, basically, not the kind I'm 

talking about; and that no claims are limited to certain 

categories of litigants.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: There -- there's a question 

of causality, so some of them will -- will not be valid 

because you can't show that the -- that the State was 

coerced into doing something and therefore you can't 

show that the violation of the Constitution caused your 

injury.

 MR. McALLISTER: And that's -- but you're 

talking now really the causality; that's an Article III

separate, the next step, the prudential third-party 

standing. And I think Petitioner's view is third-party 

standing is just out the window, whether it's separation 

of powers, Tenth Amendment, anything.

 MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 Just a few points in rebuttal. First of 

all, one reason not to carve out a special rule for 

commandeering claims is that not all commandeering 

claims are created equal. Mr. Dreeben raises the 

commandeering claim that has been litigated in the 

context of SORNA, the sex registration act. I don't 

know the details of that enough to know whether that's a 

valid commandeering claim or not, or whether there's a 

redressability problem in that particular case. But I 

can certainly imagine a commandeering case, a Federal 

statute that purports to commandeer local prosecutors to 

prosecute Federal crimes, where there would be no

standing obstacle; and the problem is right now the 

lower courts aren't resolving the standing issue in the 

SORNA challenges based on a careful analysis of Article 

III standing, redressability or prudential standing, for 

that matter. They're resolving those challenges with a 

simple citation to Tennessee Electric and let's move on, 

and that's really what should stop.

 A second reason that you should not try to 

carve out commandeering cases as being somehow the 

residuum of the Tennessee Electric dictum is because 

Tennessee Electric says nothing about commandeering 

cases. It just talks broadly about Tenth Amendment 

cases. You know, we can disagree or agree; it's kind of 

hard to figure out what the nature of the claim was in 

Tennessee Electric.

 I don't think it was really much different 

from the claim that we're raising here, which is in 

Tennessee Electric they said, well, if the Federal 

Government gets to regulate power, what's left of 

State's traditional prerogative to regulate the price 

for power.

 Here is if the Federal Government can go in 

and prosecute you for putting vinegar in your neighbor's 

goldfish bowl, what's left of local law enforcement. 

think they're very similar arguments. But whatever else

is true, I just don't think Tennessee Electric limited 

itself to commandeering claims in any way that would 

allow you to say that Mr. Dreeben refers to the enduring 

force of Tennessee Electric. With all due respect, I 

don't think Tennessee Electric has any enduring force.

 The central holding of this decision was 

overruled. The further you go in the decision the less 

satisfying it is. If you go all the way to reading the 

Georgia Power case cited in footnote 27 as Justice 

Breyer has done, and you look at the role of consent of 

the States, it turns out in the district court opinion, 

that's in the merits section of the opinion.

 The Court's already held contrary, actually, 

to the holding of Tennessee Electric that the utility 

companies there had standing. So what you see is, you 

know what happens if you apply the legal interest test, 

you hopelessly conflate the merits and the standing 

question. That's kind of happened today in oral 

argument. That's a bad approach. The Court was right 

to get rid of it in camp, and it should perfect the camp 

decision by saying this sentence no longer survives.

 Two other minor points. One is on the 

Commerce Clause, I think Justice Alito shows why the 

Government was right never to make that argument below, 

but I do think it's important that if this Court says

anything about the Commerce Clause issue, it doesn't 

somehow reinject it in the case in a way that would not 

allow us to argue that it has been clearly waived in the 

Third Circuit. The Government gets to confess air, it 

doesn't get to confess, oh, actually, we have a better 

argument to defend the statute that we've never raised 

before. Plain error should be a two-way street, and 

they should not be allowed to sneak the Commerce Clause 

back into the case at this late stage.

 Finally, there is no difference between the 

separation of powers case and the Federalism case. The 

best example of that is this Court's Free Enterprise 

Fund case. When it wants a case to cite for the 

proposition that the Executive Branch cannot waive or 

acquiesce in a separation of powers violation, because 

the separation of powers is there to protect the 

individual, what does it cite? New York against United 

States. Please reverse the decision below.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

Clement.

 Mr. McAllister, this Court appointed you to 

brief and argue the case in support of the judgment 

below, you have ably discharged that responsibility for 

which we are grateful.

 The case is submitted.
