3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 12-96, Shelby 

County v. Holder. 


6  Mr. Rein? 


7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERT W. REIN 


8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 


9  MR. REIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 


please the Court: 

11  Almost 4 years ago, eight Justices of the 

12 Court agreed the 2005 25-year extension of Voting Rights 

13 Act Section 5's preclearance obligation, uniquely 

14 applicable to jurisdictions reached by Section 4(b)'s 

antiquated coverage formula, raised a serious 

16 constitutional question. 

17  Those Justices recognized that the record 

18 before the Congress in 2005 made it unmistakable that 

19 the South had changed. They questioned whether current 

remedial needs justified the extraordinary federalism 

21 and cost burdens of preclearance. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: May I ask you a 

23 question? Assuming I accept your premise, and there's 

24 some question about that, that some portions of the 

South have changed, your county pretty much hasn't.

Official 

1  MR. REIN: Well, I --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In -- in the period 

3 we're talking about, it has many more discriminating --

4 240 discriminatory voting laws that were blocked by 

Section 5 objections. 


6  There were numerous remedied by Section 2 


7 litigation. You may be the wrong party bringing this. 


8  MR. REIN: Well, this is an on-face 


9 challenge, and might I say, Justice Sotomayor --


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's the standard. 

11 And why would we vote in favor of a county whose record 

12 is the epitome of what caused the passage of this law to 

13 start with? 

14  MR. REIN: Well, I don't agree with your 

premises, but let me just say, number one, when I said 

16 the South has changed, that is the statement that is 

17 made by the eight Justices in the Northwest Austin case. 

18 And I certainly --

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And Congress -- Congress 

said that, too. Nobody -- there isn't anybody in -- on 

21 any side of this issue who doesn't admit that huge 

22 progress has been made. Congress itself said that. But 

23 in line with Justice Sotomayor's question, in the D.C. 

24 Court of Appeals, the dissenting judge there, Judge 

Williams, said, "If this case were about three States, 

4

25

Official 

1 Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama, those States have 

2 the worst records, and application of Section 5 to them 

3 might be okay." 

4  MR. REIN: Justice Ginsburg, Judge Williams 

said that, as he assessed various measures in the 

6 record, he thought those States might be distinguished. 

7 He did not say, and he didn't reach the question, 

8 whether those States should be subject to preclearance. 

9 In other words, whether on an absolute basis, there was 

sufficient record to subject them --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: But think about this State 

12 that you're representing, it's about a quarter black, 

13 but Alabama has no black statewide elected officials. 

14 If Congress were to write a formula that looked to the 

number of successful Section 2 suits per million 

16 residents, Alabama would be the number one State on the 

17 list. 

18  If you factor in unpublished Section 2 

19 suits, Alabama would be the number two State on the 

list. If you use the number of Section 5 enforcement 

21 actions, Alabama would again be the number two State on 

22 the list. 

23  I mean, you're objecting to a formula, but 

24 under any formula that Congress could devise, it would 

capture Alabama.

Official 

1  MR. REIN: Well, if -- if I might respond 


2 because I think Justice Sotomayor had a similar 


3 question, and that is why should this be approached on 


4 face. Going back to Katzenbach, and all of the cases 


that have addressed the Voting Rights Act preclearance 

6 and the formula, they've all been addressed to determine 

7 the validity of imposing preclearance under the 

8 circumstances then prevailing, and the formula because 

9 Shelby County is covered, not by an independent 

determination of Congress with respect to Shelby County, 

11 but because it falls within the formula as part of the 

12 State of Alabama. So I -- I don't think that there's 

13 any reluctance upon on this --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But facial challenges 

are generally disfavored in our law. And so the 

16 question becomes, why do we strike down a formula, as 

17 Justice Kagan said, which under any circumstance the 

18 record shows the remedy would be congruent, 

19 proportional, rational, whatever standard of review we 

apply, its application to Alabama would happen. 

21  MR. REIN: There -- there are two separate 

22 questions. One is whether the formula needs to be 

23 addressed. In Northwest Austin, this Court addressed 

24 the formula, and the circumstances there were a very 

small jurisdiction, as the Court said, approaching a 

6

25

Official 

1 very big question. 


2  It did the same in Rome, the City of Rome. 


3 It did the same in Katzenbach. The -- so the formula 


4 itself is the reason why Shelby County encounters the 


burdens, and it is the reason why the Court needs to 

6 address it. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Interestingly enough, in 

8 Katzenbach the Court didn't do what you're asking us to 

9 do, which is to look at the record of all the other 

States or all of the other counties. It basically 

11 concentrated on the record of the two litigants in the 

12 case, and from that extrapolate -- extrapolated more 

13 broadly. 

14  MR. REIN: I don't think that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're asking us to do 

16 something, which is to ignore your record and look at 

17 everybody else's. 

18  MR. REIN: I don't think that's a fair 

19 reading of Katzenbach. In Katzenbach, what the Court 

did was examined whether the -- the formula was rational 

21 in practice and theory. And what the Court said is, 

22 while we don't have evidence on every jurisdiction 

23 that's reached by the formula, that by devising two 

24 criteria, which were predictive of where discrimination 

might lie, the Congress could then sweep in 

7
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 jurisdictions as to which it had no specific findings. 

2  So we're not here to parse the 

3 jurisdictions. We are here to challenge this formula 

4 because in and of itself it speaks to old data, it isn't 

probative with respect to the kinds of discrimination 

6 that Congress was focusing on and it is an inappropriate 

7 vehicle to sort out the sovereignty of individual 

8 States. 

9  I could tell you that in Alabama the number of 

legislators in the Alabama legislature are proportionate 

11 to the number of black voters. There's a very high 

12 registration and turnout of black voters in Alabama. 

13 But I don't think that that really addresses the issue 

14 of the rationality in theory and practice in the 

formula. 

16  If Congress wants to write another statute, 

17 another hypothetical statute, that would present a 

18 different case. But we're here facing a county, a State 

19 that are swept in by a formula that is neither rational 

in theory nor in practice. That's the -- that's the hub 

21 of the case. 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose the thrust of 

23 the questions so far has been if you would be covered 

24 under any formula that most likely would be drawn, why 

are you injured under this one?

1  MR. REIN: Well, we don't agree that we 


2 would be covered under any formula. 


3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's -- that's the 


4 hypothesis. If you could be covered under most 


suggested formulas for this kind of statute, why are you 

6 injured by this one? I think that's the thrust of the 

7 question. 

8  MR. REIN: Well, I think that if -- if 

9 Congress has the power to look at jurisdictions like 

Shelby County, individually and without regard to how 

11 they stand against other States -- other counties, other 

12 States, in other words, what is the discrimination here 

13 among the jurisdictions, and after thoroughly 

14 considering each and every one comes up with a list and 

says this list gravely troubles us, that might present a 

16 vehicle for saying this is a way to sort out the covered 

17 jurisdictions --

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose Congress passed a 

19 law that said, everyone whose last name begins with A 

shall pay a special tax of $1,000 a year. And let's say 

21 that tax is challenged by somebody whose last name 

22 begins with A. Would it be a defense to that challenge 

23 that for some reason this particular person really 

24 should pay a $1,000 penalty that people with a different 

last name do not pay?

Official 

1  MR. REIN: No, because that would just 


2 invent another statute, and this is all a debate as to 


3 whether somebody might invent a statute which has a 


4 formula that is rational. 


JUSTICE SCALIA: I was about to ask a 

6 similar question. If someone is acquitted of a Federal 

7 crime, would it -- would the prosecution be able to say, 

8 well, okay, he didn't commit this crime, but Congress 

9 could have enacted a different statute which he would 

have violated in this case. Of course, you wouldn't 

11 listen to that, would you? 

12  MR. REIN: No, I agree with you. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The problem with those 

14 hypotheticals is obvious that it starts from a predicate 

that the application has no basis in any record, but 

16 there's no question that Alabama was rightly included in 

17 the original Voting Rights Act. There's no challenge to 

18 the reauthorization acts. The only question is whether 

19 a formula should be applied today. And the point is 

that the record is replete with evidence to show that 

21 you should. 

22  MR. REIN: Well, I mean --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's not like there's 

24 some made-up reason for why the $1,000 is being applied 

to you or why a different crime is going to be charged

1 against you. It's a real record as to what Alabama has 

2 done to earn its place on the list. 

3  MR. REIN: Justice Sotomayor, with all 

4 respect, the question whether Alabama was properly 

placed under the act in 1964 was -- it was answered in 

6 Katzenbach because it came under a formula then deemed 

7 to be rational in theory and in practice. 

8  There's no independent determination by the 

9 Congress that Alabama singly should be covered. 

Congress has up -- you know, has readopted the formula 

11 and it is the formula that covers Alabama and thus 

12 Shelby County --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Now, the reason for the 

14 formula -- of course, part of the formula looks back to 

what happened in 1965. And it says are you a 

16 jurisdiction that did engage in testing and had low 

17 turnout or -- or low registration? Now, that isn't true 

18 of Alabama today. 

19  MR. REIN: That's correct. That's correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So when Congress in fact 

21 reenacted this in 2005, it knew what it was doing was 

22 picking out Alabama. It understood it was picking out 

23 Alabama, even though the indicia are not -- I mean, even 

24 though they're not engaging in that particular thing. 

But the underlying evil is the discrimination. So the 

11

1 closest analogy I could think of is imagine a State has 

2 a plant disease and in 1965 you can recognize the 

3 presence of that disease, which is hard to find, by a 

4 certain kind of surface movement or plant growing up. 

Now, it's evolved. So by now, when we use 

6 that same formula, all we're doing is picking out that 

7 State. But we know one thing: The disease is still 

8 there in the State. Because this is a question of 

9 renewing a statute that in fact has worked. And so the 

question I guess is, is it rational to pick out at least 

11 some of those States? And to go back to Justice 

12 Sotomayor's question, as long as it's rational in at 

13 least some instances directly to pick out those States, 

14 at least one or two of them, then doesn't the statute 

survive a facial challenge? That's the question. 

16  MR. REIN: Thank you. Justice Breyer, a 

17 couple of things are important. The Court said in 

18 Northwest Austin, an opinion you joined, "Current needs 

19 have to generate the current burden." So what happened 

in 1965 in Alabama, that Alabama itself has said was a 

21 disgrace, doesn't justify a current burden. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: But this is then the 

23 question, does it justify? I mean, this isn't a 

24 question of rewriting the statute. This is a question 

of renewing a statute that by and large has worked.

Official 

1  MR. REIN: Justice Breyer --

2  JUSTICE BREYER: And if you have a statute 

3 that sunsets, you might say, I don't want it to sunset 

4 if it's worked, as long as the problem is still there to 

some degree. That's the question of rationality. Isn't 

6 that what happened? 

7  MR. REIN: If you base it on the findings of 

8 1965. I could take the decision in City of Rome, which 

9 follows along that line. We had a huge problem at the 

first passage of the Voting Rights Act and the Court was 

11 tolerant of Congress's decision that it had not yet been 

12 cured. There were vestiges of discrimination. 

13  So when I look at those statistics today and 

14 look at what Alabama has in terms of black registration 

and turnout, there's no resemblance. We're dealing with 

16 a completely changed situation --

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You keep -- you keep --

18  MR. REIN: -- to which if you apply those 

19 metrics -- excuse me. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rein, you keep 

21 emphasizing over and over again in your brief, 

22 registration and you said it a couple of times this 

23 morning. Congress was well aware that registration was 

24 no longer the problem. This legislative record is 

replete with what they call second generation devices.

1 Congress said up front: We know that the registration 


2 is fine. That is no longer the problem. But the 


3 discrimination continues in other forms. 


4  MR. REIN: Let me speak to that because I 


think that that highlights one of the weaknesses here. 


6 On the one hand, Justice Breyer's questioning, well, 


7 could Congress just continue based on what it found in 


8 '65 and renew? And I think your question shows it's a 


9 very different situation. Congress is not continuing 


its efforts initiated in 1975 to allow people --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the reason 

12 Section 5 was created was because States were moving 

13 faster than litigation permitted to catch the new forms 

14 of discriminatory practices that were being developed. 

As the courts struck down one form, the States would 

16 find another. And basically, Justice Ginsburg calls it 

17 secondary. I don't know that I'd call anything 

18 secondary or primary. Discrimination is discrimination. 

19  And what Congress said is it continues, not 

in terms of voter numbers, but in terms of examples of 

21 other ways to disenfranchise voters, like moving a 

22 voting booth from a convenient location for all voters 

23 to a place that historically has been known for 

24 discrimination. I think that's an example taken from 

one of the Section 2 and 5 cases from Alabama.

1  MR. REIN: Justice Sotomayor --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, I don't know 

3 what the difference is except that this Court or some 

4 may think that secondary is not important. But the form 

of discrimination is still discrimination if Congress 

6 has found it to be so. 

7  MR. REIN: When Congress is addressing a new 

8 evil, it needs then -- and assuming it can find this 

9 evil to a level justifying --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's not --

11  MR. REIN: -- the extraordinary remedy --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what it did with 

13 Section 5. It said we can't keep up with the way States 

14 are doing it. 

MR. REIN: I think we're dealing with two 

16 different questions. One is was that kind of remedy, an 

17 unusual remedy, never before and never after invoked by 

18 the Congress, putting States into a prior restraint in 

19 the exercise of their core sovereign functions, was that 

justified? And in Katzenbach, the Court said we're 

21 confronting an emergency in the country, we're 

22 confronting people who will not, who will not honor the 

23 Fifteenth Amendment and who will use --

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: And in 1986 -- or excuse me, 

2006 -- Congress went back to the problem, developed a

1 very substantial record, a 15,000-page legislative 


2 record, talked about what problems had been solved, 


3 talked about what problems had yet to be solved, and 


4 decided that, although the problem had changed, the 


problem was still evident enough that the act should 

6 continue. 

7  It's hard to see how Congress could have 

8 developed a better and more thorough legislative record 

9 than it did, Mr. Rein. 

MR. REIN: Well, I'm not questioning whether 

11 Congress did its best. The question is whether what 

12 Congress found was adequate to invoke this unusual 

13 remedy. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, Congress must have 

found that the situation was even clearer and the 

16 violations even more evident than originally because, 

17 originally, the vote in the Senate, for example, was 

18 something like 79 to 18, and in the 2006 extension, it 

19 was 98 to nothing. It must have been even clearer in 

2006 that these States were violating the Constitution. 

21 Do you think that's true? 

22  MR. REIN: No. I think the Court has 

23 to --

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that sounds like a 

good argument to me, Justice Scalia. It was clear to 98

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Or decided that perhaps 


they'd better not vote against it, that there's nothing, 

6 that there's no -- none of their interests in voting 

7 against it. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know what they're 

9 thinking exactly, but it seems to me one might 

reasonably think this: It's an old disease, it's gotten 

11 a lot better, a lot better, but it's still there. So if 

12 you had a remedy that really helped it work, but it 

13 wasn't totally over, wouldn't you keep that remedy? 

14  MR. REIN: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: Or would you not at least 

16 say that a person who wants to keep that remedy, which 

17 has worked for that old disease which is not yet dead, 

18 let's keep it going. Is that an irrational decision? 

19  MR. REIN: That is a hypothetical that 

doesn't address what happened because what happened is 

21 that the old disease, limiting people's right to register 

22 and vote, to have --

23  JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm sorry. The old 

24 disease is discrimination under the Fifteenth Amendment,

2  MR. REIN: But the focus of the Congress in 

3 1965 and in Katzenbach in 1964 and in Katzenbach was on 

4 registration and voting, precluding --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It was on voter dilution 

6 as well. It had already evolved away from that, or 

7 started to. 

8  MR. REIN: I beg your pardon, but I think, 

9 Justice Sotomayor, that this Court has never decided 

that the Fifteenth Amendment governs vote dilution. It 

11 has said the Fourteenth Amendment does, but the original 

12 enactment was under the Fifteenth Amendment. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the Fifteenth 

14 Amendment says "denial or abridgement." What would 

"abridgement" mean except for dilution? 

16  MR. REIN: Well, "abridgement" might mean, 

17 for example, I let you vote in one election, but not in 

18 another; for example, separate primary rules from 

19 election rules. Abridgement can be done in many ways. 

I think dilution is a different concept. 

21 We're not saying that dilution isn't covered by the 

22 Fourteenth Amendment, but I was responding to 

23 Justice Breyer in saying there was an old disease and 

24 that disease is cured. If you want to label it 

"disease" and generalize it, you can say, well, the new

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Some of the questions 


6 asked to this point I think mirror what the government 


7 says toward the end of its brief, page 48 and page 49. 


8 It's rather proud of this reverse engineering: We 


9 really knew it was some specific States we were 


interested in, and so we used these old categories to 

11 cover that State. 

12  Is that a methodology that in your view is 

13 appropriate under the test of congruence and -- and 

14 proportionality? 

MR. REIN: No, I think it is not. First of 

16 all, I don't accept that it was, quote, "reverse 

17 engineered." I think it was just, as Justice Breyer 

18 indicated, continued because it was there. If you look 

19 at what was done and was approved in 1964, what Congress 

said, well, here are the problem areas that we detect. 

21 We've examined them in detail. We've identified the 

22 characteristics that would let somebody say, yes, that's 

23 where the discrimination is ripe. They're using a 

24 tester device. The turnout is below the national 

average by a substantial margin. That spells it out and

2 it was all very rational. 

3  Here you'd have to say is the finding with 

4 respect to every State -- Alaska, Arizona, the covered 

jurisdictions in New York City -- is the designation of 

6 them congruent to the problem that you detect in each 

7 one? Even assuming -- and we don't accept -- that any 

8 of these problems require the kind of extraordinary 

9 relief, what's the congruence and what's the 

proportionality of this remedy to the violation you 

11 detect State by State. 

12  So merely saying it's reverse engineered, 

13 first of all it says, well, Congress really thought 

14 about it and said, we made up a list in our heads and, 

gee whiz, this old formula miraculously covered the 

16 list. There's no record that that happened. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, are you --

what I got from the government's brief and what I'm 

21 getting -- getting from some of the questions from the

23  MR. REIN: If -- if there was a record 

24 sufficient for each of those States to sacrifice

4 that record here, so --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, and -- and I don't 

6 know why -- why you even go that far. I don't know why 

7 under the equal footing doctrine it would be proper to 

8 just single out States by name, and if that, in effect, 

9 is what is being done, that seemed to me equally 

improper. But you don't seem to make that argument. 

11  MR. REIN: Well, I think that --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought -- I thought the 

13 same thing. I thought it's sort of extraordinary to say 

14 Congress can just pick out, we want to hit these eight 

States, it doesn't matter what formula we use; so long 

16 as we want to hit these eight States, that's good enough 

17 and that makes it constitutional. I doubt that that's 

18 true. 

19  MR. REIN: Justice Scalia, I agree with 

that. What I was saying here is that Congress did --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why? Why does Congress 

22 have to fix any problem immediately? 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I would like to hear the

MR. REIN: Okay. The answer,

1 Justice Kennedy, is Congress cannot arbitrarily pick out 

2 States. Congress has to treat each State with equal 

3 dignity. It has to examine all the States. The 

4 teaching of Katzenbach is that when Congress has done 

that kind of examination, it can devise a formula even 


6 if it understands that that formula will not apply 


7 across all 50 States. 


8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, the formula that 


9 has --


MR. REIN: So we accept Katzenbach. But in 

11 terms of just picking out States and saying, I'm going 

12 to look at you and I'm going to look at you, no, that --

13 that does not protect the equal dignity of the States. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Rein, the formula 

that -- that is applied right now, under that formula 

16 covered jurisdictions, which have less than 25 percent 

17 of the nation's total population, they account for 

18 56 percent of all successful published Section 2 

19 lawsuits. 

If you do that on a per capita basis, the 

21 successful Section 2 lawsuits, four times higher in 

22 covered jurisdictions than in noncovered jurisdictions. 

23 So the formula -- you can -- you know, say maybe this 

24 district shouldn't be covered, maybe this one should be 

covered.

1  The formula seems to be working pretty well 

2 in terms of going after the actual violations on the 

3 ground and who's committing them. 

4  MR. REIN: There are -- there are two 

fallacies, Justice Kagan, in -- in that statement. 

6 Number one is treating the covered jurisdictions as some 

7 kind of entity, a lump: Let us treat them. And as 

8 Judge Williams did in his dissent, if you look at them 

9 one by one, giving them their equal dignity, you won't 

reach the same result. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, all formulas are 

12 underinclusive and all formulas are overinclusive. 

13 Congress has developed this formula and has continued it 

14 in use that actually seems to work pretty well in 

targeting the places where there are the most successful 

16 Section 2 lawsuits, where there are the most violations 

17 on the ground that have been adjudicated. 

18  MR. REIN: Well, if -- if you look at the 

19 analysis State by State done by Judge Williams, that 

isn't true. Congress has picked out some States that 

21 fall at the top and some that do not, and there are 

22 other States like Illinois or Tennessee, and I don't 

23 think they deserve preclearance, that clearly have 

24 comparable records. 

And second, dividing by population may make

2 only irrational when we object to it, but note that in 


3 the brief of the Harris Respondent they say it's 


4 irrational because, after all, that makes Delaware, a 


small State, look worse on the list of who are the primary 

6 violators. It's not a useful metric. It may make a 

7 nice number. But there is no justification for that 

8 metric. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: And it happens not to be 

the method that Congress selected. 

11  MR. REIN: Correct. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: If they selected that, you 

13 could say they used a rationale that works. But just 

14 because they picked some other rationale, which happens 

to produce this result, doesn't seem to me very 

16 persuasive. 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your time is --

expire for the rebuttal period. But I do have this 

21 question: Can you tell me -- it seems to me that the 

22 government can very easily bring a Section 2 suit and as 

23 part of that ask for bail-in under Section 3. Are those 

24 expensive, time-consuming suits? Do we have anything in

1 experience that you could advise us? 


2  MR. REIN: Well --


3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is this an effective 


4 remedy? 


MR. REIN: It is -- number one, it is 


6 effective. There are preliminary injunctions. It 


7 depends on the kind of dispute you have. Some of them 


8 are very complex, and it would be complex if somebody 


9 brought -- a State brought a Section 5 challenge in a 


three-judge court saying the attorney general's denied 

11 me preclearance. So it's the complexity of the 

12 question, not the nature of Section 2. 

13  And might I say, if you look at the Voting 

14 Rights Act, one thing that really stands out is you are 

up against States with entrenched discriminatory 

16 practices in their law. The remedy Congress put in 

17 place for those States was Section 2. And all across 

18 the country, when you talk about equal sovereignty, if 

19 there is a problem in Ohio the remedy is Section 2. So 

if Congress thought that Section 2 was an inadequate 

21 remedy, it could look to the specifics of Section 2 and 

22 say, maybe we ought to put timetables in there or modify 

23 it. 

24  But that's not what happened. They 

reenacted Section 2 just as it stood. So I think that 

25

1 Section 2 covers even more broadly because it deals with 

2 results, which the Court has said is broader than 

3 effects. It's an effective remedy, and I think at this 

4 point, given the record, given the history, the right 

thing to do is go forward under Section 2 and remove the 

6 stigma of prior restraint and preclearance from the 

7 States and the unequal application based on data that 

8 has no better history than 1972. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rein, I just remind 

because it's something we said about equal footing, in 

11 Katzenbach the Court said, "The doctrine of the equality 

12 of the States invoked by South Carolina does not bar 

13 this approach, for that doctrine applies only to the 

14 terms upon which States are admitted to the Union and 

not to the remedies for local evils which have 

16 subsequently appeared." That's what -- has the Court 

17 changed that interpretation? 

18  MR. REIN: I think that that referred in 

19 Katzenbach -- I'm familiar with that statement. It 

referred to the fact that once you use a formula you are 

21 not -- you are selecting out. The Court felt the 

22 formula was rational in theory and practice and 

23 therefore it didn't, on its face, remove the equality of 

24 the States. They were all assessed under the same two 

criteria. Some passed, some did not. But I think that 

26

1 that really doesn't mask the need for equal treatment of 

2 the sovereign States. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm going to have a hard 

4 time with that because you can't be suggesting that the 

government sees a problem in one or more States and 

6 decides it's going to do something for them and not for 

7 others, like emergency relief, and that that somehow 

8 violates the equal footing doctrine. You can't treat 

9 States the same because their problems are different, 

their populations are different, their needs are 

11 different. Everything is different about the States. 

12  MR. REIN: Well, I think when Congress uses 

13 the powers delegated under Article I, Section 8, it has 

14 substantial latitude in how it exercises the power. We 

are talking about remedial power here. We are talking 

16 about overriding powers that are reserved to the States 

17 to correct abuse. When Congress does that, it has to 

18 treat them equally. It can't say --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would you tell me what 

you think is left of the rational means test in 

21 Katzenbach and City of Rome? Do you think the City of 

22 Boerne now controls both Fourteen -- the Fourteenth and 

23 the Fifteenth Amendment and how we look at any case that 

24 arises under them? 

MR. REIN: Justice Sotomayor, I think that

1 the two tests have a lot in common because in City of 


2 Boerne, the Katzenbach decision was pointed out as a 


3 model of asking the questions that congruence in 


4 proportionality ask us to address. Number one, how 


does this remedy meet findings of constitutional 

6 violation? You've got to ask that question. They asked 

7 that question in Katzenbach. What is the relation 

8 between the two? 

9  And then I think you have to ask the 

question: All right -- you know, is this killing a fly 

11 with a sledgehammer, a fair question because when you 

12 start to invade core functions of the States, I think 

13 that a great deal of caution and care is required. So I 

14 think that the rational basis test, the McCulloch test, 

still applies to delegated powers. 

16  But here on the one hand the Solicitor 

17 defends under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment 

18 saying, well, if something doesn't violate the 

19 Fifteenth, it violates the Fourteenth. And the Court's 

precedent under the Fourteenth Amendment is very clear 

21 that the City of Boerne congruence and proportionality 

22 test applies. The Court has applied it, but I don't 

23 think we -- we wouldn't really need to get that far 

24 because we believe that if you examine it under 

McCullough, just as they did in Katzenbach, it would

8  ORAL ARGUMENTS OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., 

9  ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

11 Justice, and may it please the Court: 

12  There's a fundamental point that needs to be 

13 made at the outset. Everyone acknowledges, Petitioner, 

14 its amici, this Court in Northwest Austin, that the 

Voting Rights Act made a huge difference in transforming 

16 the culture of blatantly racist vote suppression that 

17 characterized parts of this country for a century. 

18  Section 5 preclearance was the principal 

19 engine of that progress. And it has always been true 

that only a tiny fraction of submissions under Section 5 

21 result in objections. So that progress under Section 5 

22 that follows from that has been as a result of the 

23 deterrence and the constraint Section 5 imposes on 

24 States and subjurisdictions and not on the actual 

enforcement by means of objection.

1  Now, when Congress faced the question 

2 whether to reauthorize Section 5 in 2006, it had to 

3 decide whether the -- whether it could be confident that 

4 the attitudes and behaviors in covered jurisdictions had 

changed enough that that very effective constraint and 


6 deterrence could be confidently removed. And Congress 


7 had, as Judge Kagan identified earlier, a very 


8 substantial record of continuing need before it when 


9 it --


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask you just a 

11 little bit about that record? Do you know how many 

12 submissions there were for preclearance to the Attorney 

13 General in 2005? 

14  GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't know the precise 

number, but many thousands. That's true.

17 how many objections the Attorney General lodged? 

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: There was one in that 

19 year. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One, so one out of 

21 3700. 

22  GENERAL VERRILLI: But I think -- but, 

23 Mr. Chief Justice, that is why I made the point a minute 

24 ago that the key way in which Section 5 -- it has to be 

the case, everyone agrees, that the significant progress

1 that we've made is principally because of Section 5 of 

2 the Voting Rights Act. And it has always been true that 

3 only a tiny fraction of submissions result in 

4 objections. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that will always be true 

6 forever into the future. You could always say, oh, 

7 there has been improvement, but the only reason there 

8 has been improvement are these extraordinary procedures 

9 that deny the States sovereign powers, which the 

Constitution preserves to them. So, since the only 

11 reason it's improved is because of these procedures, we 

12 must continue those procedures in perpetuity. 

13  GENERAL VERRILLI: No.

are making? 

16  GENERAL VERRILLI: That is not the argument. 

17 We do not think that --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that was the 

19 argument you were just making. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: It is not. Congress 

21 relied on far more on just the deterrent effect. There 

22 was a substantial record based on the number of 

23 objections, the types of objections, the findings of --

voter turnout to African American voter turnout? 

6  GENERAL VERRILLI: I do not. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Massachusetts. Do 

8 you know what has the best, where African American 

9 turnout actually exceeds white turnout? Mississippi. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. 

11 But Congress recognized that expressly in the findings 

12 when it reauthorized the act in 2006. It said that the 

13 first generation problems had been largely dealt with, 

14 but there persisted significant --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which State has the 

16 greatest disparity in registration between white and 

17 African American? 

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: I do not know that. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Massachusetts. 

Third is Mississippi, where again the African American 

21 registration rate is higher than the white registration 

22 rate. 

23  GENERAL VERRILLI: But when Congress -- the 

24 choice Congress faced when it -- Congress wasn't writing 

on a blank slate in 2006, Mr. Chief Justice. It faced a 

32

1 choice. And the choice was whether the conditions were 

2 such that it could confidently conclude that this 

3 deterrence and this constraint was no longer needed, and 

4 in view of the record of continuing need and in view of 

that history, which we acknowledge is not sufficient on 

6 its own to justify reenactment, but it's certainly 

7 relevant to the judgment Congress made because it 

8 justifies Congress having made a cautious choice in 2006 

9 to keep the constraint and to keep the deterrence in 

place. 

11  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there's no question 

12 that --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, in the 

14 reauthorization --

JUSTICE ALITO: There's no question --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Alito. 

17  JUSTICE ALITO: There is no question that 

18 the Voting Rights Act has done enormous good. It's one 

19 of the most successful statutes that Congress passed 

during the twentieth century and one could probably go 

21 farther than that. 

22  But when Congress decided to reauthorize it 

23 in 2006, why wasn't it incumbent on Congress under the 

24 congruence and proportionality standard to make a new 

determination of coverage? Maybe the whole country 

33

1 should be covered. Or maybe certain parts of the 


2 country should be covered based on a formula that is 


3 grounded in up-to-date statistics. 


4  But why -- why wasn't that required by the 


congruence and proportionality standards? Suppose that 

6 Congress in 1965 had based the coverage formula on 

7 voting statistics from 1919, 46 years earlier. Do you 

8 think Katzenbach would have come out the same way? 

9  GENERAL VERRILLI: No, but what Congress did 

in 2006 was different than what Congress did in 1965. 

11 What Congress did -- Congress in 2006 was not writing on 

12 a clean slate. The judgment had been made what the 

13 coverage formula ought to be in 1965, this Court upheld 

14 it four separate times over the years, and that it seems 

to me the question before Congress under congruence and 

16 proportionality or the reasonably adapted test in 

17 McCullough -- or whatever the test is, and under the 

18 formula in Northwest Austin is whether the judgment to 

19 retain that geographic coverage for a sufficient 

relation to the problem Congress was trying to target, 

21 and Congress did have before it very significant 

22 evidence about disproportionate results in Section 2 

23 litigation in covered jurisdictions, and that, we 

24 submit, is a substantial basis for Congress to have made 

the judgment that the coverage formula should be kept in

1 place, particularly given that it does have a bail-in

3 allows for tailoring over time. 


4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: This reverse engineering 


that you seem so proud of, it seems to me that that 

6 obscures the -- the real purpose of -- of the statute. 

7 And if Congress is going to single out separate States 

8 by name, it should do it by name. If not, it should use 

9 criteria that are relevant to the existing -- and 

Congress just didn't have the time or the energy to do 

11 this; it just reenacted it. 

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think the -- the 

13 formula was -- was rational and effective in 1965. The 

14 Court upheld it then, it upheld it three more times 

after that. 

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the Marshall Plan 

17 was very good, too, the Morrill Act, the Northwest 

18 Ordinance, but times change. 

19  GENERAL VERRILLI: And -- but the question 

is whether times had changed enough and whether the 

21 differential between the covered jurisdictions and the 

22 rest of the country had changed enough that Congress 

23 could confidently make the judgment that this was no 

24 longer needed.

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Verrilli, could 


3 you respond to the question that Justice Kennedy asked 


4 earlier, which was for why isn't Section 2 enough now? 


The government could bring Section 2 claims if it seeks 

6 privately to do. Why isn't -- he asked if it was 

7 expensive. You heard the question, so. 

8  GENERAL VERRILLI: Yes. With respect to --

9 start with Katzenbach. Katzenbach made the point that 

Section 2 litigation wasn't an effective substitute for 

11 Section 5 because what Section 5 does is shift the 

12 burden of inertia. And there's a -- I think it is 

13 self-evident that Section 2 cannot do the work of 

14 Section 5. 

Take one example: Polling place changes. 

16 That in fact is the most frequent type of Section 5 

17 submission, polling place changes. Now, changes in the 

18 polling places at the last minute before an election can 

19 be a source of great mischief. Closing polling places, 

moving them to inconvenient locations, et cetera. 

21  What Section 5 does is require those kinds 

22 of changes to be pre-cleared and on a 60-day calendar, 

23 which effectively prevents that kind of mischief. And 

24 there is no way in the world you could use Section 2 to 

effectively police those kinds of activities.

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I do think the 

2 evidence is very clear that Section -- that individual 

3 suits under Section 2 type litigation were just 

4 insufficient and that Section 5 was utterly necessary in 

1965. No doubt about that. 

6  GENERAL VERRILLI: And I think it 

7 remains true --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But with -- with a modern 

9 understanding of -- of the dangers of polling place 

changes, with prospective injunctions, with preliminary 

11 injunctions, it's not clear -- and -- and with the fact 

12 that the government itself can commence these suits, 

13 it's not clear to me that there's that much difference 

14 in a Section 2 suit now and preclearance. I may be 

wrong about that. I don't have statistics for it. 

16 That's why we're asking. 

17  GENERAL VERRILLI: I -- I don't -- I don't 

18 really think that that conclusion follows. I think 

19 these under the -- there are thousands and thousands of 

these under-the-radar screen changes, the polling places 

21 and registration techniques, et cetera. And in most of 

22 those I submit, Your Honor, the -- the cost-benefit 

23 ratio is going to be, given the cost of this litigation, 

24 which one of the -- one of the reasons Katzenbach said 

Section 5 was necessary, is going to tilt strongly

1 against bringing these suits. 


2  Even with respect to the big ticket items, 


3 the big redistrictings, I think the logic Katzenbach 


4 holds in that those suits are extremely expensive and 


they typically result in after-the-fact litigation. 

6  Now, it is true, and the Petitioners raised 

7 the notion that there could be a preliminary injunction, 

8 but I really think the Petitioner's argument that 

9 Section 2 is a satisfactory and complete substitute for 

Section 5 rests entirely on their ability to demonstrate 

11 that preliminary injunctions can do comparable work to 

12 what Section 5 does. They haven't made any effort to do 

13 that. And while I don't have statistics for you, I can 

14 tell you that the Civil Rights Division tells me that 

it's their understanding that in fewer than one-quarter 

16 of ultimately successful Section 2 suits was there a 

17 preliminary injunction issued. 

18  So I don't think that there's a basis, 

19 certainly given the weighty question before this Court 

of the constitutionality of this law, to the extent the 

21 argument is that Section 2 is a valid substitute for 

22 Section 5, I just don't think that the -- that the

11 Dozens? What? 

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: I think it's dozens. And 

13 so the -- and so it -- so it's a substantial number. It 

14 is true in theory that those people could be used to 

bring Section 2 litigation. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

17  GENERAL VERRILLI: But that doesn't answer 

18 the mail, I submit, because it's still -- you're never 

19 going to get at all these thousands of under-the-radar 

changes and you're still going to be in the position 

21 where the question will be whether preliminary 

22 injunctions are available to do the job. There is no 

23 evidence that that's true. 

24  And I'll point out there's a certain irony 

in the argument that what -- that what Petitioner wants

1 is to substitute Section 2 litigation of that kind for 

2 the Section 5 process, which is much more efficient and 

3 much more -- and much speedier, much more efficient and 

4 much more cost effective. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Then why shouldn't it apply 

6 everywhere in the country? 

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, because I think 

8 Congress made a reasonable judgment that the problem --

9 that in 2006, that its prior judgments, that there --

that there was more of a risk in the covered 

11 jurisdictions continued to be validated by the Section 2 

12 evidence. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you do really think 

14 there was -- that the record in 2006 supports the 

proposition that -- let's just take the question of 

16 changing the location of polling places. That's a 

17 bigger problem in Virginia than in Tennessee, or it's a 

18 bigger problem in Arizona than Nevada, or in the Bronx 

19 as opposed to Brooklyn. 

GENERAL VERRILLI: I think the combination 

21 of the history, which I concede is not dispositive, but 

22 is relevant because it suggests caution is in order and 

23 that's a reasonable judgment on the part of Congress, 

24 the combination of that history and the fact that there 

is a very significant disproportion in successful

1 Section 2 results in the covered jurisdictions as 

2 compared to the rest of the country, that Congress was 

3 justified in concluding that there -- that it -- there 

4 was reason to think that there continued to be a serious 

enough differential problem to justify --

6  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the statistics that I 

7 have before me show that in, let's say the 5 years prior 

8 to reauthorization, the gap between success in Section 2 

9 suits in the covered and the non-covered jurisdiction 

narrowed and eventually was eliminated. Do you disagree 

11 with that? 

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: Well, I think the --

13 the -- you have to look at it, and Congress 

14 appropriately looked at it through a broader -- in a --

in a broader timeframe, and it made judgments. And I 

16 think that actually, the -- the right way to look at it 

17 is not just the population judgment that Mr. Rein was 

18 critical of, the fact is, and I think this is in the 

19 Katz amicus brief, that the covered jurisdictions 

contain only 14 percent of the subjurisdictions in the 

21 nation. And so 14 percent of the subjurisdictions in 

22 the nation are generating up to 81 percent of the 

23 successful Section 2 litigation. And I think --

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General, is it -- is 

it the government's submission that the citizens in the

2  GENERAL VERRILLI: It is not, and I do not 

3 know the answer to that, Your Honor, but I do think it 

4 was reasonable for Congress --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, which you said 

6 it is not, and you don't know the answer to it. 

7  GENERAL VERRILLI: I -- it's not our 

8 submission. As an objective matter, I don't know the 

9 answer to that question. But what I do know is that 

Congress had before it evidence that there was a 

11 continuing need based on Section 5 objections, based on 

12 the purpose-based character of those objections, based 

13 on the disparate Section 2 rate, based on the 

14 persistence of polarized voting, and based on a gigantic 

wealth of jurisdiction-specific and anecdotal evidence, 

16 that there was a continuing need. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A need to do what? 

18  GENERAL VERRILLI: To maintain the deterrent 

19 and constraining effect of the Section 5 preclearance 

process in the covered jurisdictions, and that --

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And not -- and not 

22 impose it on everyone else? 

23  GENERAL VERRILLI: And -- that's right, 

24 given the differential in Section 2 litigation, there 

was a basis for Congress to do that.

Official 

1  JUSTICE BREYER: So what's your answer? I 

2 just want to be sure that I hear your answer to an 

3 allegation, argument, an excellent argument, that's been 

4 made, or at least as I've picked up, and that is that: 

Yes, the problem was terrible; it has gotten a lot 


6 better; it is not to some degree cured. All right? I 


7 think there is a kind of common ground. Now then the 


8 question is: Well, what about this statute that has a 


9 certain formula? One response is: Yes, it has a 


formula that no longer has tremendous relevance in terms 

11 of its characteristic -- that is literacy tests. But it 

12 still picked out nine States. So, so far, you're with 

13 me. 

14  So it was rational when you continue. You 

know, you don't sunset it. You just keep it going. 

16 You're not held to quite the same criteria as if you 

17 were writing it in the first place. But it does treat 

18 States all the same that are somewhat different. 

19  One response to that is: Well, this is the 

Fifteenth Amendment, a special amendment -- you know? 

21 Added by. Maybe you're right. Then let's proceed State 

22 by State. Let's look at it State by State. That's what 

23 we normally do, not as applied. 

24  All right. Now, I don't know how 

satisfactory that answer is. I want to know what your 

43

20

25

Official 

1 response is as to whether we should -- if he's right --

2 if he's right that there is an irrationality involved if 

3 you were writing it today in treating State A, which is 

4 not too discriminatorily worse than apparently 

Massachusetts or something. All right? So -- so if 

6 that's true, do we respond State by State? Or is this a 

7 matter we should consider not as applied, but on its 

8 face? 

9  I just want to hear what you think about 

that. 

11  GENERAL VERRILLI: Let me give two 

12 responses, Justice Breyer. The first is one that 

13 focuses on the practical operation of the law and the 

14 consequences that flow from it. I do not think that 

Shelby County or Alabama ought to be able to bring a 

16 successful facial challenge against this law on the 

17 basis that it ought not to have covered Arizona or 

18 Alaska. The statute has bailout mechanism. Those 

19 jurisdictions can try to avail themselves of it. And if 

they do and it doesn't work, then they -- they may very 

21 well have an as-applied challenge that they can bring to 

22 the law. But that doesn't justify -- given the 

23 structure of the law and that there is a tailoring 

24 mechanism in it, it doesn't justify Alabama --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't -- I don't

25

Official 

1 understand the distinction between facial and as-applied 

2 when you are talking about a formula. As applied to 

3 Shelby County, they are covered because of the formula, 

4 so they're challenging the formula as applied to them. 

And we've heard some discussion. I'm not even sure what 

6 your position is on the formula. Is the formula 

7 congruent and proportional today, or do you have this 

8 reverse engineering argument? 

9  GENERAL VERRILLI: Congress's decision in 

2006 to reenact the geographic coverage was congruent 

11 and proportional because Congress had evidence --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To -- to the problem 

13 or -- or was the formula congruent and proportional to 

14 the remedy? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: The Court has upheld the 

16 formula in four different applications. So the Court 

17 has found four different times that the formula was 

18 congruent and proportional. And the same kinds of 

19 problems that Mr. Rein is identifying now were --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- I'm sorry. 

21  GENERAL VERRILLI: -- were true even back in 

22 City of Rome because of course the tests and devices 

23 were eliminated by the statute, so no -- no jurisdiction 

24 could have tests and devices. And City of Rome itself 

said that the registration problems had been very 

45
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 substantially ameliorated by then, but there were 

2 additional kinds of problems. The ascent of these 

3 second-generation problems was true in City of Rome as a 

4 justification that made it congruent and proportional. 

And we submit that it's still true now, that 

6 Congress wasn't writing on a blank slate in 2006. 

7 Congress was making a judgment about whether this 

8 formula, which everyone agrees, and in fact Mr. Rein's 

9 case depends on the proposition that Section 5 was a big 

success. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe it was making 

12 that judgment, Mr. Verrilli. But that's -- that's a 

13 problem that I have. This Court doesn't like to get 

14 involved in -- in racial questions such as this one. 

It's something that can be left -- left to Congress. 

16  The problem here, however, is suggested by 

17 the comment I made earlier, that the initial enactment 

18 of this legislation in a -- in a time when the need for 

19 it was so much more abundantly clear was -- in the 

Senate, there -- it was double-digits against it. And 

21 that was only a 5-year term. 

22  Then, it is reenacted 5 years later, again 

23 for a 5-year term. Double-digits against it in the 

24 Senate. Then it was reenacted for 7 years. Single 

digits against it. Then enacted for 25 years, 8 Senate 

46

Official 

1 votes against it. 

2  And this last enactment, not a single vote 

3 in the Senate against it. And the House is pretty much 

4 the same. Now, I don't think that's attributable to the 

fact that it is so much clearer now that we need this. 

6 I think it is attributable, very likely attributable, to 

7 a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial 

8 entitlement. It's been written about. Whenever a 

9 society adopts racial entitlements, it is very difficult 

to get out of them through the normal political 

11 processes. 

12  I don't think there is anything to be gained 

13 by any Senator to vote against continuation of this act. 

14 And I am fairly confident it will be reenacted in 

perpetuity unless -- unless a court can say it does not 

16 comport with the Constitution. You have to show, when 

17 you are treating different States differently, that 

18 there's a good reason for it. 

19  That's the -- that's the concern that those 

of us who -- who have some questions about this statute 

21 have. It's -- it's a concern that this is not the kind 

22 of a question you can leave to Congress. There are 

23 certain districts in the House that are black districts 

24 by law just about now. And even the Virginia Senators, 

they have no interest in voting against this. The State

Voting Rights Act. Who is going to vote against that in 

6 the future? 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have an extra 5 

8 minutes. 

9  GENERAL VERRILLI: Thank you. I may need it 

for that question. 

11  (Laughter.) 

12  GENERAL VERRILLI: Justice Scalia, there's a 

13 number of things to say. First, we are talking about 

14 the enforcement power that the Constitution gives to the 

Congress to make these judgments to ensure protection of 

16 fundamental rights. So this is -- this is a situation 

17 in which Congress is given a power which is expressly 

18 given to it to act upon the States in their sovereign 

19 capacity. And it cannot have been lost on the framers 

of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments that the 

21 power Congress was conferring on them was likely to be 

22 exercised in a differential manner because it was, the 

23 power was conferred to deal with the problems in the 

24 former States of the Confederacy. 

So with respect to the constitutional grant 

48
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 of power, we do think it is a grant of power to Congress 

2 to make these judgments, now of course subject to review 

3 by this Court under the standard of Northwest Austin, 

4 which we agree is an appropriate standard. That's the 

first point. 

6  The second point is I do -- I do say with 

7 all due respect, I think it would be extraordinary to --

8 to look behind the judgment of Congress as expressed in 

9 the statutory findings, and -- and evaluate the judgment 

of Congress on the basis of that sort of motive 

11 analysis, as opposed to --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: We looked behind it in 

13 Boerne. I'm not talking about dismissing it. I'm --

14 I'm talking about looking at it to see whether it makes 

any sense. 

16  GENERAL VERRILLI: And -- but -- but I do 

17 think that the deference that Congress is owed, as City 

18 of Boerne said, "much deference" -- Katzenbach said 

19 "much deference." That deference is appropriate because 

of the nature of the power that has been conferred here 

21 and because, frankly, of the superior institutional 

22 competence of Congress to make these kinds of judgments. 

23 These are judgments that assess social conditions. 

24 These are predictive judgments about human behavior and 

they're predictive judgments about social conditions and 

49

1 human behavior about something that the people in 

2 Congress know the most about, which is voting and the 

3 political process. 

4  And I would also say I understand your point 

about entrenchment, Justice Scalia, but certainly with 

6 respect to the Senate, you just can't say that it's in 

7 everybody's interests -- that -- that the enforcement of 

8 Section 5 is going to make it easier for some of those 

9 Senators to win and it's going to make it harder for 

some of those Senators to win. And yet they voted 

11 unanimously in favor of the statute. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you think the 

13 preclearance device could be enacted for the entire 

14 United States? 

GENERAL VERRILLI: I don't think there is a 

16 record that would substantiate that. But I do think 

17 Congress was --

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that is because that 

19 there is a federalism interest in each State being 

responsible to ensure that it has a political system 

21 that acts in a democratic and a civil and a decent and a 

22 proper and a constitutional way. 

23  GENERAL VERRILLI: And we agree with that, 

24 we respect that, we acknowledge that Northwest 

Austin requires an inquiry into that.

2 to have monuments to the heros of the Civil Rights 

3 Movement, if it wants to acknowledge the wrongs of its 

4 past, is it better off doing that if it's an own 

independent sovereign or if it's under the trusteeship 


6 of the United States government? 


7  GENERAL VERRILLI: Of course it would be 


8 better in the former situation. But with all due 


9 respect, Your Honor, everyone agrees that it was 


appropriate for -- for Congress to have exercised this 

11 express constitutional authority when it did in 1965, 

12 and everybody agrees that it was the -- was the exercise 

13 of that authority that brought about the situation where 

14 we can now argue about whether it's still necessary. 

And the point, I think, is of fundamental 

16 importance here is that that history remains relevant. 

17 What Congress did was make a cautious choice in 2006 

18 that given the record before it and given the history, 

19 the more prudent course was to maintain the deterrent 

and constraining effect of Section 5, even given the 

21 federalism costs because, after all, what it protects is 

22 a right of fundamental importance that the Constitution 

23 gives Congress the express authority to protect through 

24 appropriate legislation.

8 our position is. They've brought a facial challenge. 


9 We -- we recognize that it's a facial challenge. 


We're defending it as a facial challenge, 

11 but our point is that the facial challenge can't succeed 

12 because they are able to point out that there may be 

13 some other jurisdictions that ought not to be 

14 appropriately covered, and that's especially true 

because there is a tailoring mechanism in the statute. 

16 And if the tailoring mechanism doesn't work, then 

17 jurisdictions that could make such a claim may well have 

18 an as-applied challenge. That's how we feel.

Official 

1 please the Court: 

2  The extensive record supporting the renewal of 

3 the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act 

4 illustrates two essential points about the nature and 

continuing aspects of voting discrimination in the 

6 affected areas. The first speaks to this question of 

7 whether Section 2 was adequate standing alone. 

8  As our brief demonstrates, in Alabama and in many 

9 of the covered jurisdictions, Section 2 victories often 

need Section 5 to realize the benefits of the -- of the 

11 ruling in the Section 2 case. That is to say, that 

12 these measures act in tandem to protect minority 

13 communities, and we've seen it in a number of cases. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's true in every 

State, isn't it? 

16  MR. ADEGBILE: Justice Scalia --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean -- you know, I don't 

18 think anybody is contesting that it's more effective if 

19 you use Section 5. The issue is why just in these 

States. That's it. 

21  MR. ADEGBILE: Fair enough. It's beyond a 

22 question of being true in any place. Our brief shows 

23 that specifically in the covered jurisdictions, there is 

24 a pattern, a demonstrated pattern of Section 2 and 5 

being used in tandem whereas in other jurisdictions, 

53
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 most of the Section 2 cases are one-off examples. 

2  We point to a whole number of examples. 

3 Take for example Selma, Alabama. Selma, Alabama in the 

4 1990s, not in the 1960s but in the 1990s, had a series 

of objections and Section 2 activity and observers all 

6 that were necessary to continue to give effect to the 

7 minority inclusion principle that Section 5 was passed 

8 to vindicate in 1965. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But a Section 2 case can, 

in effect, have an order for bail-in, correct me if I'm 

11 wrong, under Section 3 and then you basically have a 

12 mini -- something that replicates Section 5. 

13  MR. ADEGBILE: The bail-in is available --

14 bail-in is available if there's an actual finding of a 

constitutional violation. It has been used in -- in a 

16 number of circumstances. The United States brief has an 

17 appendix that points to those. One of the recent ones 

18 was in Port Chester, New York, if memory serves. But 

19 it's quite clear that the pattern in the covered 

jurisdictions is such that the repetitive nature of 

21 discrimination in those places -- take, for example, the 

22 case in LULAC. 

23  After this Court ruled that the 

24 redistricting plan, after the 2000 round of 

redistricting, bore the mark of intentional 

54
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 discrimination, in the remedial election, the State of 

2 Texas tried to shorten and constrain the early voting 

3 period for purposes of denying the Latino community of 

4 the opportunity to have the benefits of the ruling. 

What we've seen in Section 2 cases is that 

6 the benefits of discrimination vest in incumbents who 

7 would not be there, but for the discriminatory plan. 

8 And Congress, and specifically in the House Report, I 

9 believe it's page 57, found that Section 2 continues to 

be an inadequate remedy to address the problem of these 

11 successive violations. 

12  Another example that makes this point very 

13 clearly is in the 1990s in Mississippi. There was an 

14 important Section 2 case brought, finally after 

100 years, to break down the dual registration system 

16 that had a discriminatory purpose. When Mississippi 

17 went to implement the National Voter Registration Act, 

18 it tried to bring back dual registration, and it was 

19 Section 5 -- Section 5 enforcement action that was able 

to knock it down. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree with 

22 the reverse engineering argument that the United States 

23 has made today? 

24  MR. ADEGBILE: I would frame it slightly 

differently, Chief Justice Roberts. My understanding is 

55
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 that the history bears some importance in the context of 

2 the reauthorizations, but that Congress in -- in none of 

3 the reauthorizations stopped with the historical 

4 backward look. It takes cognizance of the experience, 

but it also looks to see what the experience has been on 

6 the ground. And what Congress saw in 2006 is that there 

7 was a surprisingly high number of continuing objections 

8 after the 1982 reauthorization period and that --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess -- I guess 

the question is whether or not that disparity is 

11 sufficient to justify the differential treatment under 

12 Section 5. Once you take away the formula, if you think 

13 it has to be reverse engineered and -- and not simply 

14 justified on its own, then it seems to me you have a 

much harder test to justify the differential treatment 

16 under Section 5. 

17  MR. ADEGBILE: This Court in Northwest 

18 Austin said that it needs to be sufficiently related, 

19 and I think there are two principal sources of evidence. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we also said 

21 congruent and proportional. 

22  MR. ADEGBILE: Indeed. Indeed. I don't 

23 understand those things to be unrelated. I think that 

24 they're part of the same, same test, same evaluative 

mechanism. The idea is, is Congress -- the first 

56
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 question is, is Congress remedying something or is it 

2 creating a new right. That's essentially what Boerne is 

3 getting to, is Congress trying to go -- do an 

4 end-around, a back doorway to expand the Constitution. 

We know in this area Congress is trying to implement the 

6 Fifteenth Amendment and the history tells us something 

7 about that. But specifically to the question --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the Fifteenth 

9 Amendment is limited to intentional discrimination, and, 

of course, the preclearance requirement is not so 

11 limited, right? 

12  MR. ADEGBILE: That's correct. But this 

13 Court's cases have held that Congress, in proper 

14 exercise of its remedial powers, can reach beyond the --

the core of the intentional discrimination with 

16 prophylactic effect when they have demonstrated that a 

17 substantial problem exists. 

18  The -- the two things that speak to this 

19 issue about the disparity in coverage and continuing to 

cover these jurisdictions, there are two major inputs. 

21 The first is the Section 5 activity. The Section 5 

22 activity shows that the problem persists. It's a range 

23 of different obstacles, and Section 5 was passed to 

24 reach the next discriminatory thing. The case in --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Section 5 -- the 

57

25

Official 

1 Section 5 activity may show that there's a problem in 

2 the jurisdictions covered by Section 5, but it says 

3 nothing about the presence or absence of similar 

4 problems in noncovered jurisdictions, isn't that right? 

MR. ADEGBILE: Absolutely, Justice Alito. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: All right. 

7  MR. ADEGBILE: And so I come to my second 

8 category. The second category, of course, is the piece 

9 of the Voting Rights Act that has national application, 

Section 2. And what the evidence in this case shows, 

11 and it was before Congress, is that the concentration of 

12 Section 2 successes in the covered jurisdictions is 

13 substantially more. Justice Kagan said that it was four 

14 times more adjusting for population data. 

The fact of the matter is that there is 

16 another piece of evidence in the record in this case 

17 where Peyton McCrary looks at all of the Section 

18 2 cases, and what he shows is that the directional 

19 sense, that the Ellen Katz study pointed to dramatically 

understates the disparity under Section 2. And so 

21 he found that 81 percent --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think all of the 

23 noncovered States are worse in that regard than the nine 

24 covered States, is that correct?

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Every -- every one of them 

2 is worse. 

3  MR. ADEGBILE: Justice Scalia, it's -- it's 

4 a fair question, and -- and I was speaking to the 

aggregate --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not just a fair one, 

7 it's the crucial question. Congress has selected these 

8 nine States. Now, is there some good reason for 

9 selecting these nine? 

MR. ADEGBILE: What we see in the evidence 

11 is that of the top eight States with section --

12 favorable Section 2 outcomes, seven of them, seven of 

13 them are the covered jurisdictions. The eighth was 

14 bailed in under the other part of the mechanism that, as 

Justice Kennedy points out, can bring in some 

16 jurisdictions that have special problems in voting. And 

17 so we think that that points to the fact that this is 

18 not a static statute, it's a statute that is --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but his point, I think 

the point is this: If you draw a red line around the 

21 States that are in, at least some of those States have a 

22 better record than some of the States that are out. So 

23 in 1965, well, we have history. We have 200 years or 

24 perhaps of slavery. We have 80 years or so of legal 

segregation. We have had 41 years of this statute. And

1 this statute has helped, a lot. 

2  So therefore Congress in 2005 looks back and 

3 says don't change horses in the middle of the stream 

4 because we still have a ways to go. 

Now the question is, is it rational to do 


6 that? And people could differ on that. And one thing 


7 to say is, of course this is aimed at States. What do 


8 you think the Civil War was about? Of course it was 


9 aimed at treating some States differently than others. 


And at some point that historical and practical 

11 sunset/no sunset, renew what worked type of 

12 justification runs out. And the question, I think, is 

13 has it run out now? 

14  And now you tell me when does it run out? 

What is the standard for when it runs out? Never? 

16 That's something you have heard people worried about. 

17 Does it never run out? Or does it run out, but not yet? 

18 Or do we have a clear case where at least it doesn't run 

19 out now? 

Now, I would like you to address that. 

21  MR. ADEGBILE: Fair enough, Justice Breyer. 

22 I think that the -- what the evidence shows before 

23 Congress is that it hasn't run out yet. The whole 

24 purpose of this act is that we made progress and 

Congress recognized the progress that we made. And, for

1 example, they took away the examiner provision which was 

2 designed to address the registration problem. 

3  In terms of when we are there, I think it 

4 will be some point in the future. Our great hope is 

that by the end of this next reauthorization we won't be 

6 there. Indeed, there is an overlooked provision that 

7 says in 15 years, which is now 9 years from where I 

8 stand here today before you, Congress should go back and 

9 look and see is it still necessary. 

So we don't think that this needs to be 

11 there in perpetuity. But based on the record and a 2011 

12 case in which a Federal judge in Alabama cited this 

13 Court's opinion in Northwest Austin -- there were 

14 legislators that sit today that were caught on tape 

referring to African American voters as illiterates. 

16 Their peers were referring to them as aborigines. 

17  And the judge, citing the Northwest Austin 

18 case -- it's the McGregor case cited in our brief --

19 said that, yes, the South has changed and made progress, 

but some things remain stubbornly the same and the 

21 trained effort to deny African American voters the 

22 franchise is part of Alabama's history to this very day. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Have there been 

24 episodes, egregious episodes of the kind you are talking 

about in States that are not covered?

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then it 


4 doesn't seem to help you make the point that the 


differential between covered and noncovered continues to 

6 be justified. 

7  MR. ADEGBILE: But the great weight of 

8 evidence -- I think that it's fair to look at -- on some 

9 level you have to look piece by piece, State by State. 

But you also have to step back and look at the great 

11 mosaic. 

12  This statute is in part about our march 

13 through history to keep promises that our Constitution 

14 says for too long were unmet. And this Court and 

Congress have both taken these promises seriously. In 

16 light of the substantial evidence that was adduced by 

17 Congress, it is reasonable for Congress to make the 

18 decision that we need to stay the course so that we can 

19 turn the corner. 

To be fair, this statute cannot go on 

21 forever, but our experience teaches that six amendments 

22 to the Constitution have had to be passed to ensure 

23 safeguards for the right to vote, and there are many 

24 Federal laws. They protect uniform voters, some protect 

eligible voters who have not had the opportunity yet to

8  MR. REIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 


9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think that the 


right to vote is a racial entitlement in Section 5? 

11  MR. REIN: No. Section -- the Fifteenth 

12 Amendment protects the right of all to vote and --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I asked a different 

14 question. Do you think Section 5 was voted for because 

it was a racial entitlement? 

16  MR. REIN: Well, Congress --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think there was 

18 no basis to find that --

19  MR. REIN: -- was reacting -- may I say 

Congress was reacting in 1964 to a problem of race 

21 discrimination, which it thought was prevalent in 

22 certain jurisdictions. So to that extent, as the 

23 intervenor said, yes, it was intended to protect those 

24 who had been discriminated against.

4 anywhere? 

MR. REIN: I think that the world is not 

6 perfect. No one -- we are not arguing perfectibility. 

7 We are saying that there is no evidence that the 

8 jurisdictions that are called out by the formula are the 

9 places which are uniquely subject to that kind of 

problem --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But shouldn't --

12  MR. REIN: We are not trying --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You've given me some 

14 statistics that Alabama hasn't, but there are others 

that are very compelling that it has. Why should we 

16 make the judgment, and not Congress, about the types and 

17 forms of discrimination and the need to remedy them? 

18  MR. REIN: May I answer that? Number one, 

19 we are not looking at Alabama in isolation. We are 

looking at Alabama relative to other sovereign States. 

21 And coming to Justice Kennedy's point, the question is 

22 has Alabama, even in isolation, and those other States 

23 reached the point where they ought to be given a chance, 

24 subject to Section 2, subject to cases brought directly 

under the Fifteenth Amendment, to exercise their

3 have 240 successful Section 2 and Section 5 --

4  MR. REIN: Again -- Justice Sotomayor, I 

could parse statistics, but we are not here to try 

6 Alabama or Massachusetts or any other State. The 

7 question is the validity of the formula. That's what 

8 brings Alabama in. 

9  If you look at Alabama, it has a number of 

black legislators proportionate to the black population 

11 of Alabama. It hasn't had a Section 5 rejection in a 

12 long period. 

13  I want to come to Justice Breyer's point 

14 because I think that -- I think he's on a somewhat 

different wavelength, which is isn't this a mere 

16 continuation? Shouldn't the fact that we had it before 

17 mean, well, let's just try a little bit more until 

18 somebody is satisfied that the problem is cured? 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: I had said don't change 

horses. You renew what is in the past --

21  MR. REIN: Right. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: -- where it works, as long 

23 as the problem isn't solved. Okay? 

24  MR. REIN: Well, and I think the problem to 

which the Voting Rights Act was addressed is solved.

1 You look at the registration, you look at the voting. 

2 That problem is solved on an absolute, as well as, a 

3 relative basis. So that's like saying if I detect that 

4 there is a disease afoot in the population in 1965 and I 

have a treatment, a radical treatment that may help cure 

6 that disease, when it comes to 2005 and I see a new 

7 disease or I think the old disease is gone, there is a 

8 new one, why not apply the old treatment? 

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Rein --

MR. REIN: I wouldn't --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- that is the question, 

12 isn't it? You said the problem has been solved. But 

13 who gets to make that judgment really? Is it you, is it 

14 the Court, or is it Congress? 

MR. REIN: Well, it is certainly not me. 

16  (Laughter.) 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a good answer. I 

18 was hoping you would say that. 

19  MR. REIN: But I think the question is 

Congress can examine it, Congress makes a record; it is 

21 up to the Court to determine whether the problem indeed 

22 has been solved and whether the new problem, if there is 

23 one --

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's a big, new 

power that you are giving us, that we have the power now

1 to decide whether racial discrimination has been solved? 

2 I did not think that that fell within our bailiwick. 

3  MR. REIN: I did not claim that power, 

4 Justice Kagan. What I said is, based on the record made 

by the Congress, you have the power, and certainly it 

6 was recognized in Northwest Austin, to determine whether 

7 that record justifies the discrimination among --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: But there is this 

9 difference, which I think is a key difference. You 

refer to the problem as the problem identified by the 

11 tool for picking out the States, which was literacy 

12 tests, et cetera. But I suspect the problem was the 

13 denial or abridgement by a State of the right to vote on 

14 the basis of race and color. And that test was a way of 

picking out places where that problem existed. 

16  Now, if my version of the problem is the 

17 problem, it certainly is not solved. If your version of 

18 the problem, literacy tests, is the problem, well, you 

19 have a much stronger case. So how, in your opinion, do 

we decide what was the problem that Congress was 

21 addressing in the Voting Rights Act? 

22  MR. REIN: I think you look at Katzenbach 

23 and you look at the evidence within the four corners of 

24 the Voting Rights Act. It responds to limited 

registration and voting as measured and the use of

1 devices. 

2  The devices are gone. That problem has been 

3 resolved by the Congress definitively. So it can't be 

4 the basis for further -- further legislation. 

I think what we are talking about here is 

6 that Congress looks and says, well, we did solve that 

7 problem. As everyone agrees, it's been very effective, 

8 Section 5 has done its work. People are registering and 

9 voting and, coming to Justice Scalia's point, Senators 

who see that a very large group in the population has 

11 politically wedded themselves to Section 5 are not going 

12 to vote against it; it will do them no good. 

13  And so I think, Justice Scalia, that 

14 evidence that everybody votes for it would suggest some 

of the efficacy of Section 5. You have a different 

16 constituency from the constituency you had in 1964. 

17  But coming to the point, then if you think 

18 there is discrimination, you have to examine that 

19 nationwide. They didn't look at some of the problems of 

dilution and the like because they would have found them 

21 all over the place in 1965. But they weren't responding 

22 to that. 

23  They were responding to an acute situation 

24 where people could not register and vote. There was 

intentional denial of the rights under the Fifteenth
