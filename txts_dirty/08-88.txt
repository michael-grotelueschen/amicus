 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-88, Vermont v. Brillon.

 Ms. Rainville.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINA RAINVILLE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. RAINVILLE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 There are many reasons to reverse the 

Vermont Supreme Court in this case. I am going to begin 

by addressing four reasons as a matter of law that do 

not require the Court to -- to review the record. The 

first is, even if we assume that the public defender is 

an assigned counsel -- and for the purposes of argument, 

I am just going to use the term "public defender." If 

we assume that public defenders do little or nothing in 

a case, one cannot have a rule that that time is 

chargeable under the speedy trial right to the State 

because to do so creates chaos of constitutional 

proportions in the criminal justice system.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you a question 

that goes at least to one possible application of -- of 

your argument? Your argument for the State, the 

position that you just took, would -- would apply to the

period of time, as I understand it, in which the 

individual named, the defender named Sleigh, had been 

appointed to -- to represent the defendant.

 And as I understand it, when this case was 

argued in the Supreme Court of Vermont, the State 

conceded that, in fact, some prejudice should be 

attributed and it should be held against the State that 

Sleigh in effect did nothing. They said, well, don't 

hold it against us quite as much as you might, but, in 

any case, that can be held against us.

 Here you don't take that position, and I --

I don't know whether it's open to you -- it seems to me 

that it's not open to you -- to take a different 

position with respect to Sleigh here than the Attorney 

General of Vermont did when it was before the Supreme 

Court of Vermont. And I -- I have to assume that you 

just see it differently from the way the Attorney 

General did. But would -- would you comment on -- on 

the position that the State took and tell me why you can 

take a different position here?

 MS. RAINVILLE: Yes. Yes, Your Honor. The 

State did take the position that the eight-month period, 

which included the four months where Attorney Sleigh was 

involved, was a neutral factor. And under the dicta in 

Barker, that would allow the Court to apply it against

the State, although not to weigh it heavily as a -- as a 

neutral factor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MS. RAINVILLE: That was dicta in Barker, 

but controlling to the Vermont Supreme Court. Before 

this Court, however, on these facts --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it was conceded, wasn't 

it, in the -- in the Vermont Supreme Court?

 MS. RAINVILLE: It was conceded that it was 

a neutral time period.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MS. RAINVILLE: And -- and --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, then, why isn't that 

concession binding here?

 MS. RAINVILLE: I think it -- it may be 

binding if the Court determines it's binding. But I 

don't think it should be binding because this Court is 

considering policy that's going to affect all States and 

all courts. And the issue that was raised by the 

National Governors Association, for example, as to 

whether public defenders can be State actors -- and the 

law is clear that they cannot -- that's an important 

issue.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it is, but that is 

not an issue that is necessarily implied by the -- by

the concession that the Attorney General made in the 

Vermont Supreme Court.

 MS. RAINVILLE: Yes. Yes, but also if you 

look at the record, the three years of delay, the time 

period involving Mr. Sleigh is approximately four 

months. If you take all four months where he was 

appointed by the docket or two months if you take the 

time where he thought and understood that he was on the 

case, and in light of the three-year delay, that amount 

of time is really inconsequential.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It may have been a 

good concession below. I mean, it would -- as I 

understand it, the problem arose because of change in 

the contract, right?

 MS. RAINVILLE: That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, that may 

well have been attributable to the State.

 MS. RAINVILLE: It -- it may well have been 

attributable to the defender general. And that's one of 

the problems in this case is that we don't have a record 

of why different attorneys -- Attorney No. 4, Donaldson, 

and Attorney No. 5, Sleigh, were never asked what they 

did or --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose you are 

willing to concede that there are situations where the

delay would be attributable to the State because of 

systemic problems?

 MS. RAINVILLE: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The State has so 

many cases, and it's only willing to hire one lawyer. 

That lawyer can't possibly handle all the cases.

 MS. RAINVILLE: Absolutely. But that's not 

the case here. That might be the situation if, for 

example, the defender general said to every defendant: 

If you want a trial with a lawyer, you have to wait a 

year. That's not what happened here.

 What happened here is the defender general 

was incredibly diligent. He appointed new counsel five 

times the same day. The day of the arraignment Mr. 

Ammons was appointed. The day Mr. Ammons withdrew, 

replacement counsel, Mr. Harnett, was appointed. The 

day Mr. Harnett withdrew, replacement counsel was 

appointed. The day Mr. Donaldson withdrew, the docket 

shows that Sleigh was appointed. Five times the same 

day the defender general appointed counsel.

 The sixth time, given that we are in 

Vermont, a very small State with few lawyers, he had 

difficulty finding a sixth lawyer. But the defender 

general took extraordinary measures and went to the 

Vermont Legislature and obtained funding, and the

legislature came up to the plate very quickly, in a 

matter of weeks.

 The last withdrawal of Lawyer No. 5 happens 

on April 10th. It's June 20th that there is the letter 

in the appendix from the defender general saying that 

the legislature has approved new funding. It's -- it's 

literally a matter of weeks before the legislature comes 

to the plate and provides additional funding.

 So to the extent that -- that that is State 

action, the defender general has been incredibly 

expeditious, incredibly diligent, and went to the 

extraordinary length of getting additional funding for 

the sixth lawyer. We -- we would concede --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess when -- when the 

last two lawyers withdrew because their contracts had 

expired, I suppose the court could have refused to 

permit them to withdraw, couldn't it?

 MS. RAINVILLE: It could have.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Couldn't it say you -- you 

have an ethical duty; having undertaken representation, 

and it being very difficult to get anybody else, you --

you stay in the case?

 MS. RAINVILLE: The -- the court could have, 

and certainly --

State's court -- not the State's fault no matter what? 

Is -- is the court's misfeasance the State's 

misfeasance? Do you attribute that to the State?

 MS. RAINVILLE: The court's misfeasance 

would -- would certainly be attributable to the State, 

but we would argue that it would be a neutral factor. 

But here, Your Honor, Brillon would -- in terms of the 

fourth lawyer, Mr. Donaldson, he sought to have him 

fired. And, in fact, it was his letter to the court and 

then a subsequent motion to the court to have that 

lawyer dismissed. And in that colloquy when the -- when 

the -- the trial judge asked Brillon, do you want to 

have -- do you still want to have him fired despite all 

this delay and everything, and Brillon says yes, clearly 

the court with regard to Donaldson could have said to 

Donaldson, you stay on this case and get this case to 

trial. But Brillon waived that. Brillon said that he 

wanted a new lawyer.

 With regard to Sleigh --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- with that particular 

period. The trouble that I have with that particular 

period is August 1, 2003, to June 14, 2004, isn't that 

right? That is Donaldson -- or that's Moore?

 MS. RAINVILLE: That's Moore.

the first one?

 MS. RAINVILLE: Donaldson was actually 

Lawyer No. 4.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Go ahead.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Before you start, let me 

just make a comment and a -- and a question based on it. 

The comment is I -- I'm willing to accept a lot of what 

you say here, there is plenty of blame to go around. 

But you accept, as I understand it, the proposition that 

the State has simply got an affirmative duty to make 

some kind of effective trial and representation 

arrangement. It -- it -- it has that duty through 

providing the public defender, it has that duty simply 

through providing a court that will keep things moving, 

and I think that's common ground.

 If that, as it seems to be, is common 

ground, then do we have anything before us in this case, 

except sort of going through the list of counsel, the 

list of reasons, the list of delays and reviewing the 

Vermont Supreme Court on, in effect, the details that it 

assumed in applying the rule? In other words, it seems 

to me that there isn't an issue of principle dividing 

the parties here, it's a series of issues of details. 

Is that an unfair way to look at the case as we've got

it?

 MS. RAINVILLE: You can certainly look at it 

in terms of details, and I think that the Vermont 

Supreme Court's findings are unsupported by the record. 

But as a matter of law, you have delays by State actors, 

and even if you take the two or the four months for 

Sleigh aside, the rest of the delay, three years of 

delay minus -- there's four months, of course, which he 

had no counsel -- but three years minus that time, is 

all caused by non-State actors.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but if you take 

Sleigh, Donaldson, and the period in which there was 

no -- I guess, following Sleigh, in which there was no 

counsel appointed at all, you're already up to just 

about a year. And a year is -- is enough to trigger 

Neil v. Biggers. And so, it seems to me that what --

what the fight, what the serious fight is about is, 

well, within the further total of two-year period, who 

is to blame for this, who was to blame to that, and 

I'm -- I'm not sure that it's of any value to just go 

through and second-guess the Supreme Court of Vermont on 

those details, because you've got enough in Neil v. 

Biggers before you even get to those details.

 MS. RAINVILLE: Well, also in terms of just 

based on Brillon's admission, there's enough for this

Court to decide the case. He admits that he fired three 

different lawyers.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there -- isn't there 

that very important principle involved here that doesn't 

simply involve calculating particular periods of delay? 

When you have a defendant who starts out by firing a 

lawyer and engineering the withdrawal of another lawyer 

by threatening a lawyer, is it appropriate then to go 

through all of the subsequent periods and attribute the 

delay to the defendant or to the prosecution or as a 

neutral factor as if those, the initial events, hadn't 

occurred?

 We don't know how quickly this case would 

have gone to trial if the first lawyer hadn't been fired 

or if the third lawyer, I guess it was, had not been 

threatened and forced to withdraw.

 MS. RAINVILLE: I believe you're absolutely 

right, Justice Alito. In this case his conduct was so 

unconscionable in threatening both his lawyer, and the 

facts there --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I really wanted to ask you 

pretty much exactly the same question. If we assume 

exactly the terrible way he fired the first two -- the 

first lawyer certainly, maybe the second, would it be

true that no matter how long the delay occurred after 

that, he could never get Sixth Amendment relief?

 MS. RAINVILLE: I would -- I wouldn't go 

that far, Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why not?

 MS. RAINVILLE: Because what if the State 

kept him for ten years without a trial? I don't think 

that would ever happen. Certainly on these facts 

there's no basis, given his conduct, to balance anything 

in his favor. Vermont's --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there -- as I 

understand it, that that first year the Vermont Supreme 

Court agrees with you.

 MS. RAINVILLE: That's right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: They said, we're not 

counting any of that against you.

 Now we go into the second year, and the 

second year had to do with Mr. Donaldson, a lot of it. 

And it turns out that Mr. Donaldson actually had left 

the office within a few days of his having been 

appointed to do this and then he never did anything. So 

the Supreme Court of Vermont says, as far as Mr. 

Donaldson is concerned, we do hold that against the 

State for the reason that it is the equivalent of not 

giving him anybody. The guy they gave him wasn't even a

public defender, he never did a thing. All right.

 Now we go to the third group. The third 

group, the State agreed they should be charged. That's 

Mr. Sleigh. The third one they agreed with it. They 

said lightly, but they agreed with it.

 And as to the final group, Mrs. Moore, well, 

it looks like from the record as if the reason that was 

held against the State had nothing to do with her 

performance. It had to do with the fact that the State 

didn't give certain records to her, which everybody 

would agree, if it's true, should be chargeable to the 

prosecution, which is the State.

 So we have four periods. In one of them you 

won; in the second one he had no lawyer at all, 

according to the court; in the third one you agree it 

should be chargeable to you; and in the fourth one it 

has to do possibly with prosecution errors, not defense 

errors.

 Now, what are we supposed to decide? Are we 

supposed to decide whether my statement is, in fact, a 

correct statement? If so, why isn't it? I guess we 

have to read the record. But what else is there to 

decide?

 MS. RAINVILLE: I think you can decide it 

without reviewing the record, based on the fact that you

have a defendant who fired his first lawyer six months 

into the case, one day before trial.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And you won that.

 MS. RAINVILLE: And then filed -- fired a 

second lawyer when the lawyer initially argued and said, 

no, no, it's not true, I've been working; he then 

threatened to kill the lawyer. Then he at that time was 

told: If you want a new lawyer, there's going to be 

inevitable delays. He said: That's okay, I still want 

to fire this lawyer. Then he went on and fired yet 

another lawyer.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose -- I'm not 

sure that we necessarily want to get into the particular 

details of a very complicated record, but there are 

several points in the Vermont Supreme Court opinion 

where it says that the failure of assigned lawyers to do 

anything to move the case forward is attributable to the 

State. And I thought the fundamental principle we were 

debating is whether or not assigned lawyers who fail to 

move a case forward, whether that is attributable to the 

defendant or whether it is attributable to the State 

because they happen to work for the State.

 And I would assume one way to dispose of the 

case would be to decide that general question and send 

it back for the Vermont Supreme Court with that guidance

that they were wrong, as a general matter, to assign 

delay caused by the counsel to the State, to sort 

through the record themselves.

 MS. RAINVILLE: And I think that's a very 

important point, Mr. Chief Justice.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that point in the case? 

Where -- where is that in this case? I don't know who 

-- I didn't see anywhere where the Vermont Supreme Court 

said anything, said that, except in the instance where 

you agreed with them.

 Where is it in their -- where is it -- who 

are they are referring to when they said that? Is that 

Donaldson? Because I thought the claim with Donaldson 

was it -- it was not his attribution, nothing he did was 

attributed. Rather, it was the State's failure to 

appoint anyone, because to appoint Donaldson was to 

appoint no one since he had left the office and since he 

did nothing.

 Now, is that what we're supposed to decide: 

When a State appoints a person who has already left the 

office and does nothing, under those circumstances is it 

correct to attribute to the State their failure to 

appoint anybody?

 MS. RAINVILLE: Well, first let me address 

this point of two lawyers who did little or nothing. In

Strickland v. Washington, this Court said how extremely 

important it is when determining ineffective assistance 

to have a strong presumption that counsel's conduct 

falls within the wide range of reasonable professional 

assistance, and that there should be a hearing to ask 

counsel what they did.

 Here the Vermont Supreme Court makes this 

ruling without anyone at any point ever asking Mr. 

Donaldson or Mr. Sleigh what they did.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Rainville, underneath 

or between the lines there seems to be great discontent 

on the part of the Vermont Supreme Court with the way 

the public defender system is operating. And if we hold 

for you as a matter of the federal speedy trial right, 

the Vermont Supreme Court could go back and decide just 

the same thing under the Vermont Constitution, couldn't 

it?

 MS. RAINVILLE: It could except for that we 

believe that this decision creates an unconstitutional 

situation in creating two different classes of 

defendant, indigent and non-indigent, in their speedy 

trial rights, such that henceforth the prosecution and 

the courts must treat every indigent defendant 

differently merely because they're indigent when they 

ask for a continuance or when they ask for change of

counsel. We have to oppose those. So that we make the 

unpleasant choice of the constitutional due process 

violation, that we would rather push a defendant who's 

indigent to trial before his counsel's ready, because 

the constitutional violation there is only one of due 

process and he'll get a new trial, versus agreeing to 

allow their counsel to have time to prepare, in which 

case we risk a speedy trial violation, where he will be 

able to walk free despite his guilt.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Rainville, you -- you 

began your presentation with a statement that gave me so 

much hope. You said you were going to give us three 

reasons why we wouldn't have to get into the hairy facts 

of the case and could decide it on -- on issues of law. 

Okay? You only mentioned the first. What are the other 

two?

JUSTICE SCALIA: Remind us of the first.

 MS. RAINVILLE: The first is that this 

creates an unconstitutional situation where there are 

two classes of defendants treated differently by the 

State and by the courts.

 The second is that the delays in this case 

were caused by non-State actors and as a matter of law 

under Polk County cannot be a constitutional violation.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that sort of gets us 

into the facts at some point. I mean, that does get us 

into the facts.

 What's the third?

 MS. RAINVILLE: The third is that, based on 

his concessions, his admissions in the brief, he's 

waived it; and that's under Barker v. Wingo where the 

Court talks about standard waiver doctrine applies in 

speedy trial.

 And the fourth is that under the balancing 

test based solely on his admissions, his conduct ought 

to weigh like a ton of bricks against whatever happened 

with the State.

might for rebuttal.

If you look on pages 27 through 28 of the 

Vermont Supreme Court's opinion, it is clear that the 

Vermont Supreme Court decided this case on the basis of 

a single principle that it applied to the entirety of 

the final two years of the pretrial delay in this case, 

and that is, as the Chief Justice has noted, that the 

failure of defendant's series of assigned counsel to 

move his case to trial should be attributable to the 

State.

 As the question comes before the Court 

today, I think the primary point of dispute is whether 

there should be an exception to the general rule that a 

defendant is responsible for his own lawyer's delays in 

situations in which the lawyer purportedly does little 

or nothing to move the case to trial; and for four 

reasons we think that the Court should decline to create 

a kind of attorney inaction exception to the general 

rule.

 First of all, we think that such a rule 

would be inconsistent with the role of a lawyer in an 

adversarial system and would undermine a lawyer's 

authority to make day-to-day decisions about the 

scheduling of pretrial proceedings.

 Second, we think that such a rule would be 

enormously difficult for courts to administer in

practice, because attorney inaction is generally 

difficult to discern in the midst of pretrial 

proceedings and the risk of error would be to deprive 

the defendant of the time that his lawyer may genuinely 

need in order to prepare an effective defense.

 The third reason is that it would create 

opportunities for gamesmanship; it would create 

incentives for defendants to use the services of their 

lawyer so long as it suits them, but then to complain 

later that the lawyer was inactive and therefore they 

should not be held responsible for the lawyer's delay. 

And as to the lawyers themselves, it would create an 

incentive to unreasonably delay, with the comfort of 

knowing that the worst that would happen is the best 

possible outcome for their client, which is the 

dismissal of charges with prejudice.

 And finally, we think that such a rule would 

create an unjustifiable distinction between the 

treatments of appointed counsel and retained counsel in 

our system.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: With respect to that last 

point, let me ask you this question. Let's assume we --

we have paid counsel in a criminal case and, as a result 

of -- of delays by the prosecution, but primarily as a 

result of requests for continuance after continuance

after continuance, the -- the case is not tried; it's a 

simple case and it's not tried for three years.

 Is -- is it open to a reviewing court on 

constitutional grounds to say that the State has got an 

affirmative obligation, a non-delegable obligation, to 

bring cases to trial in a reasonable time? And whether 

the reason for the failure in this three-year case is 

because counsel just kept trying to -- to shove it off, 

or the courts were not diligent in scheduling it for 

trial, at some point that non-delegable obligation has 

been violated. Is -- is that a -- a possible 

constitutionally based position?

 MS. KRUGER: I think that Barker makes clear 

that defendants can waive their right to a speedy trial 

and that indeed defendants will often desire to put off 

trial as long as possible. I think that in giving 

proper consideration to the Barker Court's explanation 

of the nature and purposes of the right, and in 

particular focusing on the fact that the only possible 

remedy for the speedy trial violation is a remedy that 

uniquely advantages defendants and poses substantial 

burdens on society, we think ultimately a defendant 

can't escape responsibility for continuances that he has 

requested through or without the assistance of counsel, 

simply by blaming the prosecution for failing to object

or by blaming the courts for failing to go along.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what if the -- what 

if we change the facts slightly. What if the defendant 

himself never says anything on the record? The only 

thing we've got on the record are repeated requests by 

paid counsel for continuances, and then after three 

years the defendant fires paid counsel and says: I've 

been sitting in jail for three years awaiting trial, and 

I shouldn't have to wait that long.  The State has 

failed in its non-delegable duty. Would your answer 

still be the same?

 MS. KRUGER: It would still be the same. We 

think that fundamentally the principal safeguard against 

that kind of unreasonable attorney-caused delay is the 

attorney's ethical obligation, which creates a duty in 

the attorney to represent his clients with reasonable 

diligence and promptness. We think that a rule that 

would require --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Lots -- lots of very 

effective criminal trial lawyers believe that the first 

tactic is delay, delay, delay, delay, delay.

 MS. KRUGER: And I think it's precisely for 

that reason, because a delay may ultimately be in the 

client's interest, that this Court should decline to 

fashion a rule that makes the exercise of the remedy,

which is again an extreme remedy that advantages the 

defendant alone, exercisable at the option solely of the 

defendant.

 We think for that reason the defendant 

necessarily has to be responsible for any delays that 

are caused either by him or by the person who is 

appointed to represent him. Again, the ethical duty of 

the lawyer is to zealously advocate on behalf of the 

defendant's interests, and if the defendant desires to 

go to trial as quickly as possible, it's still the 

lawyer's duty under the ethical rules to try to 

accommodate that request, while at the same time doing 

everything he can to prepare an effective defense.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you this 

question about your reliance on pages 27 and 28. If you 

describe it as delays by the lawyers themselves, I 

understand your comment as being right on the nose. But 

I understood part of that to be talking about the 

situation in which the defender general's office has not 

performed its duty with sufficient promptness.

 And would you not agree if there were a 

period, say, of seven or eight months in which they just 

didn't get around to appointing a lawyer, that that 

should be charged against the State?

 MS. KRUGER: We would agree, Justice

Stevens. In this case there were a period of a total of 

about six months during which the Respondent was not 

represented at all, and we think in view of the State's 

ultimate responsibility for providing counsel to 

indigent defendants, when the State doesn't comply in a 

timely fashion with that duty, that delay is properly 

attributable to the State.

 Although in this case, because the delay was 

not the product of a deliberate effort to hamper the 

defense, we think that that period should weigh only 

lightly against the State; and ultimately, given the 

other factors at issue in this case, the absence of any 

actual trial prejudice in particular, we think that 

ultimately those six months are insufficient to 

establish a speedy trial violation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't the prejudice factor 

pretty much established as long as the guy has to stay 

in jail during this entire period?

 MS. KRUGER: I think that that's certainly 

one form of prejudice, but in the Barker balancing -- in 

Barker itself, for example, the defendant was 

incarcerated for ten months during the pretrial 

proceedings, and the Court nevertheless found that there 

was no speedy trial violation. We think a similar 

principle applies in this case. Although incarceration

is obviously prejudicial to defendants, in this case 

there was no prejudice above and beyond that. The 

Vermont Supreme Court was clear in finding the absence 

of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did he get to offset it 

against the time for the pretrial incarceration?

 MS. KRUGER: I am not aware that he did, but 

this Court made clear in Strunk that getting credit for 

time served is not an appropriate remedy for a speedy 

trial violation, that the only possible remedy is again 

what the Vermont Supreme Court did, erroneously in our 

view, which is to dismiss the charges without 

possibility of reindictment.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What would you think of a 

rule that said where most of the delay is attributable 

to the defendant, he doesn't -- he doesn't walk? That 

seems like a reasonable rule. Whatever the delay is, if 

most of it is attributable to the defendant himself, it 

is -- it is not a basis for dismissing the indictment?

 MS. KRUGER: We think that a defendant -- we 

think that that rule would make a great deal of sense. 

When a defendant --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That would make it easy to 

decide this case because the -- the supreme court's 

opinion acknowledges that most of the -- most of the

delay was caused by the defendant.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, the Vermont Supreme Court 

thought that some of the delay was caused by the 

defendant and didn't charge most of that period to the 

State to support its finding of the speedy trial 

violation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you really get by 

that rule if there were, say, four years of delay and 

two years and one month was attributable to the 

defendant and two years to the State?

 MS. KRUGER: We would think that a court 

evaluating a speedy trial claim in that case would 

properly exclude any period that was attributable to the 

defendant and focus specifically on that period that was 

attributable to the State in determining whether or not 

the right was violated.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I'm sure 

you have gone through the record and, agreeing with 

Justice Stevens that the periods where there wasn't a 

contract, the State couldn't provide somebody, do count 

against the State, but disagreeing with the Vermont 

Supreme Court that when an assigned counsel fails to 

move the case forward that is attributable to the State 

and not the defendant, what's the difference in time?

think that the -- as the case comes to the court, the 

final 11 months of the pretrial delay is not seriously 

in dispute. I think that Respondent has raised a number 

of arguments about concurrent causes of delay unrelated 

to the performance of his counsel. I think that those 

arguments are not properly before the Court because they 

fall well outside the scope of the question as to which 

this Court granted review and because they were neither 

pressed nor passed on below.

 I think that leaves the middle 14 months of 

the pretrial delay. And I think, given the Vermont 

concession, the Vermont Supreme Court focus naturally 

rests on the 5.5-month period during which Paul 

Donaldson represented Respondent. And we think, with 

respect --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes?

 MS. KRUGER: We think with respect to that 

period, we think that there is no basis for shifting the 

responsibility for that delay that Paul Donaldson sought 

before going to trial from defendant to the State 

because, as Justice Scalia has rightly pointed out, any 

contract expiration didn't in and of itself end the 

attorney-client relationship, and Paul Donaldson 

remained the agent and advocate of his client during 

that period.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM A. NELSON

 ON BEHALF OF the RESPONDENT

 MR. NELSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I apologize for jumping the gun.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sorry to delay you.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not going to get 

you off.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. NELSON: I would like to respond to --

to Vermont's argument about there being no detailed 

record about why these attorneys left when they left. 

And I -- I think if they're right, then that augurs a 

remand, that suggests a remand. But the reason there 

was no record of those departures is because the courts 

who presided over those departures never requested an 

explanation.

 With Paul Donaldson, the matter was a 

foregone conclusion. He had no contract. He was going 

into another line of work. So be it, he's out of there. 

No questioning concerning Mr. Brillon's complaints about 

his inaction, his failure to investigate, and so forth;

you done, what have you accomplished, what are you 

passing on, if anything, to the next lawyer in line, 

none of that.

 And with Sleigh, the judicial disinterest, 

if that's what it was, the judicial silence is even more 

resounding. Sleigh did not request permission to 

withdraw. He put the court on notice that he was 

withdrawing, and this came out of the blue. I don't 

think there was any heads-up for the court that this was 

going to happen, although Sleigh had expressed some 

serious reluctance to take the case and hadn't done 

anything. He didn't -- he had a filing deadline of 

April 11th, and he was supposed to file motions on that 

date, and instead of filing motions he filed this notice 

of withdrawal with no response from the court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the -- what 

is the distinction in your theory of the case between 

delay and failure -- failure to move a case -- what did 

-- what did the Vermont case say: Failure to do 

anything to move the case forward?

 When do we know that that's attributable to 

the defendant, and when is it attributable to the State?

 MR. NELSON: I think it -- I think it 

depends on the facts, and I think in each of the -- in 

the case of each of these two attorneys, the facts are

different. With Donaldson, I think the State's 

responsibility -- the State's involvement in a 

do-nothing attorney, an attorney who was really a 

nominal attorney, started from the beginning. It 

started from the appointment of -- of counsel who had 

been on contract with the State to perform defense 

services and was appointed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, if the 

lawyer is a do-nothing lawyer, then I suppose there's an 

ineffective-assistance claim?

 MR. NELSON: Well, it might mature into an 

ineffective-assistance claim, but there couldn't be an 

ineffective assistance claim on the record here because, 

well, ineffective assistance is -- is something that 

occurs at a trial. And it can't be --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's an anomaly, though, 

isn't it, that easily might have matured into 

ineffective assistance? It wasn't yet, but if Attorneys 

4 and 5, Donaldson and Sleigh -- if the case were for 

ineffective assistance of counsel, then the defendant 

would get a new trial, but here the result is he walks.

 MR. NELSON: That's -- that's a consequence 

of the speedy-trial clause in Barker and Strunk. A 

speedy-trial violation happens, by definition, before 

trial. Ineffective assistance happens, by definition

and by this Court's decisions, at trial and can't be 

determined until after trial. Unless there is -- is a 

speedy trial right and unless it's going to be enforced, 

this is the consequence. And that's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the abstract, you 

have a lawyer who is a public defender or hired as a 

public defender, and he keeps asking for continuances --

continuance, continuance. How do we tell that that's 

the State's problem as opposed to what the defendant is 

doing through his lawyer?

 MR. NELSON: I think at first you would have 

to assume that the continuances were sought in good 

faith and -- and for purposes of defense preparation. 

If the defendant had demanded a speedy trial, as this 

defendant had an early date, I think the court, looking 

at -- at a continuance motion, would have to look at it 

in that light.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is the trial 

judge supposed to do? The defense attorney keeps asking 

for continuances for purposes of investigation. I need 

more time to investigate. If -- and -- and -- can the 

court say: You need to tell me exactly what you are 

doing?

 MR. NELSON: I think, Justice Alito, that a 

court -- when a defendant has demanded a speedy trial,

that a court does have some obligation to -- to 

supervise, to monitor, to -- and -- and it happens all 

the time in criminal courts. What have you done? Have 

you seen your client? What -- how much time do you need 

for these motions? When are you going to be ready for 

trial? That happens all the time.

 And as the -- as time goes by, as the months 

pass and -- and become years, I think a court's granting 

of continuances has to be more grudging. The courts are 

under a duty because they have a duty to assure the 

speedy-trial right. Because they are the -- they are 

the primary actors in that, the court has a duty to be 

JUSTICE ALITO: Aren't you giving the 

attorney a very perverse incentive there? I mean the 

delay may help the ultimate outcome of the case, and if 

the -- if the defense attorney can engineer enough 

delay, he or she may also produce a speedy-trial 

violation.

 MR. NELSON: Well, I -- yes, of course, 

that's a -- that's a problem, and it's a problem that 

was recognized by Barker, and -- and it's a problem that 

-- that courts are well equipped to handle. They --

courts are able to and commonly do. In fact, it's their

that line to make sure lawyers adhere to them and make 

sure that the case goes to trial. They -- courts are 

well equipped to deal with that.

 But I -- I would like to point out that your 

hypothetical is not this case. That we are not dealing 

here with delays that were caused by continuance 

motions. In fact, if you look closely at the record, 

trial dates were not pushed back by continuance motions 

in this case. Trial dates were pushed back by attorney 

inaction and withdrawals.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And by your client firing 

the first attorney, correct?

 MR. NELSON: My client -- that's correct. 

My client fired -- fired the first attorney, which --

which the State says was the bad act. But look at the 

record of that firing. It wasn't really a firing, of 

course. He had no right to fire assigned counsel. But 

he had just heard his lawyer telling the judge, I'm 

handling 150 odd cases, I cannot be ready for trial, 

give me more time. I -- I -- I could be ready maybe in 

March or April, but I can't be ready now. And that was 

like three or four days before trial.

 And I would submit that any client, hearing 

his lawyer making those representations to a judge, 

would have been very upset and would, in fact, have

wanted another lawyer.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But knowing that the new 

lawyer would have to start from scratch, from the 

beginning, so it was going to take more time. If he got 

a new lawyer, it was going to take more time than if he 

stayed with the lawyer who was already acquainted with 

the case but just needed a few more weeks.

 MR. NELSON: Well, yes, but the lawyer who 

had been appointed wasn't going to get those few more 

weeks, and as Mr. Brillon said to the court, I would 

rather do it right the first time. Being charged with a 

life imprisonment offense, one can hardly blame him. 

Yes, he had to make a tradeoff, but he had to do it 

because his lawyer was not ready.

 Now, we argued in the Vermont Supreme Court 

that that time could not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, is that the 

proper remedy? I mean, it seems to me he should appeal 

to the judge and say, look, this lawyer -- is -- is that

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, wasn't there a 

concern about this defendant trying avoid a particular 

judge? That's why he wanted the continuance?

 MR. NELSON: The -- the State made that 

allegation, and it made that claim here. No court has 

found it. The Vermont Supreme Court found the opposite. 

The Vermont Supreme Court held that Brillon fired or 

asked for the dismissal of his first lawyer because he 

was not prepared to go to trial, which seems like an 

ample, sufficient and supported reason for the action he 

took. That explains the case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not only did the Vermont 

Supreme Court make that finding, it does not hear the 

witnesses, it -- it has a record before it. I can

understand if you're talking about a finding made by the 

court of first instance, but the Vermont Supreme Court 

is reviewing a record, it's not making findings.

 MR. NELSON: That's -- that's true, Justice 

Ginsburg. The trial court, however, also didn't make 

that finding, although it was asked to. And, in fact, I 

think any such finding would be entirely speculative.

 It would require the court, the fact finder, 

to interpolate various happenings that are not of 

record, and that we say never happened. It would 

require us to assume that Brillon told Ammons, I want 

you to move for a continuance on whatever grounds you 

can think of, but the real reason is to get rid of the 

judge. And that Ammons would do that for his client, 

and, you know, for the ostensible reason that he 

presented to the court, namely, he was overloaded and 

not prepared to go to trial, his secret reason was to 

get rid of the judge. And I think the record doesn't 

warrant that kind of inference, especially since it's 

been presented to and not accepted by the State courts.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is not an 

unusual reason for criminal defense lawyers in the 

private sector to ask for a continuance. It's quite 

common for the lawyers to go before the judge and say, 

look, I've got this other case going to trial next week,

I've got this and this, can I get more time, and judges 

give them the first two but not the third. And why in a 

case simply where you're dealing with a public defender 

do you presume the opposite and blame the State for 

what's a quite common practice in the private part?

 MR. NELSON: Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I'm 

only saying that this -- on this record, the conclusion 

that that was what was happening, which would be 

significant if the court were then to say, and 

therefore, it was done by the defendant who wanted delay 

despite what he said, and therefore, this is time 

considered waived under Barker. There is no basis for 

that finding.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is, I 

guess, how do we tell? I mean, if this is normal -- I 

think it is normal, I think it's quite unusual for a 

defense lawyer to be prepared to go to trial the first 

time the trial date is set. If it is normal, how do we 

tell?

 MR. NELSON: Well, actually, this wasn't the 

first -- the first request for a continuance, Chief. 

Ammons had moved for a continuance before, and it had 

been denied.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but -- again, 

I assume that's -- there are probably cases in the

private bar where that's true as well.

 MR. NELSON: How does one know? I think 

one -- I think what makes a major difference here is 

that Brillon had demanded a speedy trial. He had done 

so long before Ammons' motion for a continuance. He had 

done -- he did so almost every chance he got at almost 

every court hearing.

 You could, and I think the State does, 

assume that this was all tomfoolery and an attempt to 

manipulate the court, but there is nothing in the record 

to suggest that. That was the debate between the 

majority and the dissent at the State court. The 

majority won. As in Doggett, the -- the State is now 

coming back and trying to refight here an essentially 

factual issue which it lost in -- in the courts below.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What about Donaldson and 

Moore, those two periods? Those two periods, the 

Donaldson period and the Moore period, seem, as far as I 

can tell, which isn't that far, they seem to be periods 

when the State -- when the court below was saying that 

all that happened here was that the lawyers who were 

appointed, did a very bad job.

 You can't say they weren't appointed. It 

isn't that he didn't have counsel. He had counsel, and 

they just didn't do very much.

Now, why should that be accounted against 

the stayer? Is Moore special? Was there really a 

problem of prosecutorial behavior? Is Donaldson the 

same as Sleigh? I don't know.

 MR. NELSON: Let me start --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is Donaldson a case where 

they -- is equivalent to having no lawyer? I don't know 

how to deal with it.

 MR. NELSON: Let me start with Donaldson, 

and I think in answer to your question, I don't think 

Donaldson is substantially different from Sleigh. I 

won't go over the circumstances of Donaldson's 

appointment, but once he was appointed, he began 

conversations with the defender general about getting 

off the case. And I think the sense -- and -- and a 

significant fact about those conversations is that the 

defender general told Donaldson he was going to be 

replaced.

 We don't know exactly when that happened, 

but he told him he was going to be replaced with someone 

who was more competent, more qualified to deal with a 

life imprisonment case. So this is not information 

which will light a fire under a lawyer to prepare a 

case, that he knows he's not going to try.

 Donaldson then asks for time. It's the only

request he ever made of the court. The court gave him 

time and set filing deadlines, and he missed them. 

Missing those deadlines should have been a red flag to 

the court in a case that was already over a year old. 

The court let those deadlines pass without a word.

 The court also said, we're going to try this 

case in October. Get ready for trial in October. 

Everything should be filed by September 23rd. And for a 

reason, which the record has no explanation for, the 

October trial never happened. Donaldson was still on 

the case, his name was still on the case, and the 

October trial date passed without a murmur. It was not 

until late November that Donaldson came to the court and 

explained the situation.

 Now the court -- I think the defender 

general failed in his responsibility with regard to 

Donaldson. That's State involvement. The court failed 

in not noticing the -- the missed deadlines and in 

allowing the trial date to pass without a trial; and I 

think the Court also failed in its duty in allowing 

Donaldson off the case, which rendered any catch-up time 

that he had to do pointless, without any inquiry at all. 

The court, it's clear from the record, deferred entirely 

to the defender general, and so I think the Vermont 

court on that record thought that there was enough State

involvement here to charge -- to find the State 

responsible and to weigh some of that responsibility 

against the State. The court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does your --

your argument do to the fundamental and I think quite 

vital principle in Polk County that public defenders 

work for their clients; they don't work for the State?

 MR. NELSON: It does nothing to Polk County, 

and we acknowledge that -- that Paul Donaldson's 

inaction by itself, if it had nothing to do with the 

State, if the State did not involve itself or condone --

if the State had no responsibility with regard to that 

time, the State would have no responsibility under 

Barker. That's perfectly clear, and I don't think the 

Vermont Supreme Court's opinion, fairly read, fairly 

read says anything other than that. The Vermont --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess fairly 

read, it does say the failure of several assigned 

counsel to do anything to move the case forward is 

attributable to the State, because they didn't do 

anything, I guess is the touchstone.

 MR. NELSON: Well, I think I have two 

responses to that. One is that in the context of the 

rest of the opinion, what the court was talking about 

was a breakdown of the system, and the focus was on two

actors, both State actors, the assigning agency, the 

defender general, and the court and I don't think 

there's any dispute that both of those are indeed State 

actions, and that delays which can be traced to them, 

which they have a hand in, can be weighed against panned 

the State under Barker.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't say that; it 

really does say most of the delay was caused by the 

inability or unwillingness of assigned counsel, not of 

the -- of the institution that appoints them, 

unwillingness or inability of assigned counsel to move 

the case forward. That looks to me like --

MR. NELSON: I think -- elsewhere in the 

opinion, Justice Scalia, I think the court is clear that 

-- that they were faulting the defender general, and to 

a lesser extent the court. I think we are putting more 

stress on the court's nonfeasance than the Vermont 

Supreme Court did, but in fact, the time adds up to the 

same. The time, we're talking 14 months from 

Donaldson's assignment until Moore's assignment in 

August.

MR. NELSON: Okay.

following up on your latest answer, do you agree that it 

has to be a systemic problem? I mean, you gave us that 

-- the situation where the lawyer says I've got 150 

cases, I need a -- need a continuance.

 What if there's none of that? They've got, 

you know, 500 public defenders, and the -- but the guy 

still delays. He's responsible for not doing anything 

to move the case forward.

 MR. NELSON: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it still 

attributable to the State?

 MR. NELSON: I don't think -- I don't think 

the result depends on there being a systemic problem. I 

think in this case there was a systemic problem, and the 

Court knows about that from the findings of the indigent 

defense task force, which --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Chief Justice's 

question, I'm interested in it as well, are there 

instances in which a State-appointed counsel can delay 

and have that not attributed to the State? Is it always 

attributed to the State --

MR. NELSON: No.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just because he's State --

MR. NELSON: Absolutely there can be 

situations like that, where there is no --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: There is a delay, but it's

 MR. NELSON: It's not attributable to the 

State, it's attributable to counsel. And just the same 

as -- just the same as for private counsel. We're not 

proposing a two-tiered system there. We're --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, when is that? 

The -- you have the same situation, the defense counsel 

appointed by the State does nothing to move the case 

forward, that's as I understand it the Vermont Supreme 

Court touchstone. When is that attributable to the 

State and when is it not?

 MR. NELSON: It would not be attributable to 

the State if the assigning agency was -- had no fault, 

had no supervising duty that it failed to perform, that 

the lawyer was essentially on his own or her own; and it 

would also assume, I think, if the delay went on long 

enough, that there was no fault in the court in failing 

to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I --

MR. NELSON: -- to notice that nothing was 

happening.

then, that you're saying there has to be some systemic 

problem, that the rule that I understand the Vermont

Supreme Court to have adopted, that when assigned 

counsel does nothing to move the case forward, that 

that's attributable to the State, you would disagree 

with? You would say no, there has to be a systemic 

problem, not the -- not just the individual lawyer, but 

they're not assigning enough defenders, they're not 

supervising them, whatever.

 MR. NELSON: Maybe I'm not using the word 

systemic in the same sense you are. All I would say is 

say is it doesn't have to happen to a lot of people, it 

could happen to just one person, but it would only 

happen to that one person if a public, State agency was 

responsible for the delay.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if you have a situation 

in which the -- an attorney is appointed, the defendant 

threatens that attorney, the attorney withdraws. A 

second attorney is appointed, the client threatens that 

attorney, the attorney withdraws, and then thereafter a 

new attorney is pointed, and there is great delay. 

Maybe more -- two or three attorneys are appointed. 

There's great delay. Is -- does the -- does the chain 

of events that started all this get taken into account 

or do you just start counting the time from the 

appointment of the last attorney who wasn't threatened?

happened before, but you can -- but -- but if what 

you're saying or suggesting is that earlier bad actions 

result in a forfeiture of speedy trial rights, I would 

disagree. The way you -- the way it matters is that by 

firing, threatening, unjustifiably getting rid of a --

of a lawyer, you require the next lawyer to spend some 

time getting up to speed on the case. And that time --

JUSTICE ALITO: What if a small -- I don't 

know how many lawyers are available for appointment in 

Bennington. What if it's a small jurisdiction where 

there aren't that many who are available to be 

appointed? And so you fire the public defender, you 

threaten the first appointed counsel, and pretty soon 

you don't have very many left, or the ones that you have 

left are busy with other cases and delay results.

 MR. NELSON: But that's not the case here, 

and I think my answer to your question is that what 

makes this a State response -- failure of responsibility 

is that the State had the ability to do something about 

it. If the State's hands are tied, if they run out of 

legal talent, if there's no other way to get counsel on 

the case than by a broken-down contract system, which 

was not the case --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the point that 

Ms. Rainville made? And she talked about this balancing

that comes out of Barker, and she said you have to weigh 

against the defendant very heavily, the episodes with 

lawyer number one and number three, because that was 

really bad stuff. The State is perhaps responsible for 

some of the other delays, but she called those "neutral" 

in the weighing process. Don't those two episodes, 

counsel number one was fired, counsel number three, who 

says his life was threatened by the defendant, don't 

those have to count very heavily against the defendant?

 MR. NELSON: Justice Ginsburg, I don't think 

that Barker works that way. I think what Barker says is 

that time which is attributable to the defendant gets 

subtracted from the total delay; that that's not 

considered. That the rest of the time is a period which 

the State has to account for; and there are -- there 

will be segments of that time, segments of that delay 

which are nobody's fault, and those delays would in fact 

be truly neutral in the sense of they would have no 

weight against the State; and there are others that 

would count more or less heavily against the State.

 So I think the effect of what went on with 

Jerry Altieri, which I think was not much more than two 

months of the total time that he was on board, I think 

the effect of that is to subtract that period, and then 

any catch-up period that his firing or his dismissal

required, subtract that period as well from the total, 

and weigh the rest more or less heavily or perhaps not 

at all against the State.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the rest, I 

couldn't find in his final counsel's representation -- I 

didn't see anything in her representation that would 

suggest any lack of diligence on her part or any reason 

to count that in the speedy trial calculus. That runs 

from August 2003 to June 2004.

 MR. NELSON: To June 2004. That's correct. 

I -- I think that the opinion is not clear as to how 

much responsibility the Vermont court attributed to the 

State for that period. Vermont says they charged every 

second of the -- of that time to the State, and it's 

quite clear from the opinion that they didn't. They 

said that most of the remaining two years, as of 

Donaldson's appointment in June of '02, was attributable 

to the State. It's not clear how much of that time or 

if they actually counted it. I think that any precise 

calculation of that time period is impossible.

 We argue, and the record supports, that much 

of that time had to do with Ms. Moore getting files 

together, not only from predecessor counsel but from the 

State, and that the State delayed for many months in 

providing an updated witness list with current

addresses. She needed that to interview the witnesses. 

The case was old, and she needed the State's help there, 

with other discovery material which the record shows --

it's not in the joint appendix, but it is in the printed 

case, which was essentially Vermont Supreme Court's 

equivalent of an appendix. These materials were at 

issue for Moore. She needed them. The prosecutor was 

dilatory in providing them. And I think that that's a 

kind of vanilla reason to attribute some of that time to 

the State.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Nelson --

MR. NELSON: The court was also --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- what is your judgment 

on how much time all together was attributable to the 

State?

 MR. NELSON: I think 14 -- I think the 

Vermont court was clear about the 14 months from 

Donaldson through Moore, including the six months of no 

counsel. It adds up to 14 months. And then the rest of 

the time I don't think you can put a number on.

 Maybe it's not time that we're trying to add 

up, but responsibility. And what the -- what the State 

court was saying was when a case is as old as this one 

was when Moore took it over, the court should be very 

vigilant and grudging in its grants of continuances, and

Ginsburg, the answer to your question, he did receive 

credit for his time served.

 The important distinction that the questions 

raised show, what's so fundamentally wrong about this 

case, is the distinction between Strickland. There you 

ask the lawyers what they did. They're given deference. 

They're given the right to defend themselves. And if 

you prove that it would have had an effect on the 

outcome of the case, the defendant gets a new trial.

 Letting a defendant walk free from a crime
