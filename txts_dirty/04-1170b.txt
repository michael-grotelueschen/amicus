CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in 04-1170, Kansas versus Marsh. 

General Kline. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILL KLINE 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. KLINE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

This Court has never held that a specific 

method of weighing aggravating and mitigating evidence 

is required, yet in its individualized sentencing line 

of cases this Court has consistently said that all the 

Eighth Amendment requires is that a juror consider and 

give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence. In 

pages 23 through 28 of your appendix, you will find 

the Kansas jury instructions and Kansas law clearly, 

on four occasions, instruct individual jurors that they 

must individually consider all mitigating evidence that 

they find. Furthermore, the jurors are instructed in 

five different methods in which they can give that 

mitigating evidence the effect of a life sentence, and 

only one manner in which, acting unanimously and after 

the State has met the highest burden allowed by law in 

three separate measurements, beyond a reasonable doubt

demonstrated that the death sentence is appropriate. 

Specifically, instruction number 4, paragraph 

2 on page 24 of the joint appendix, will show the 

jurors are instructed that mercy, in and of itself, is 

a mitigating piece of evidence, and later, in the 

instruction that lays out the mitigating evidence 

presented in this specific case, they are told, in 

paragraph 18 on page 26 of your joint appendix, that 

mercy, by itself, can be sufficient to warrant a 

sentence other than death. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I'm sorry, what 

instruction is that? 

MR. KLINE: Justice Scalia, you will find it 

-- first of all, mercy is referred to in paragraph --

in instruction number 4 --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I got --

MR. KLINE: -- paragraph 2 -- okay. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that one. It's the other 

one. It was instruction number --

MR. KLINE: The instruction, again, is number 

4 in paragraph 18 on page --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I gotcha. 

MR. KLINE: -- 26. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: All the way at the end of 4, 

okay.

 MR. KLINE: You will see the instruction for 

mercy again. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you began by saying 

that there's three different measures, I think -- I 

think was the word you used. And the State, I take it, 

must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, (a) that it was 

an aggravated -- or, (a) that it was an aggravated 

murder, (b) that there was another crime involved --

MR. KLINE: Justice --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- sort of --

MR. KLINE: -- Kennedy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- if you could just walk 

me through that. 

MR. KLINE: Certainly. First of all, the 

State has to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, with 

jury unanimity, that the defendant is guilty of capital 

murder. And Kansas has one of the most narrow death-

penalty statutes in the Nation. And then, past that 

time, we then engage in a sentencing --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And --

MR. KLINE: -- phase 5. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- capital murder includes, 

in this case --

MR. KLINE: Capital murder includes, in this 

case, that the homicide involved more than one person

in a single act. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Involved more than one 

person. Then, second? 

MR. KLINE: Then we go to the sentencing 

phase, in which the State has to prove one of eight 

statutorily defined aggravating factors beyond a 

reasonable doubt with jury unanimity. There were three 

specific aggravating factors that were found by the 

jury in this instance. And then, the defendant 

introduces all mitigating evidence, and the standard of 

introduction is relevancy. But, unlike the Walton 

case, which has a functionally identical provision that 

is at issue here, the State maintains the burden, 

while, in Walton, the burden was provided to the 

defendant to demonstrate that the mitigating factors 

were so substantial to call for leniency. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You had to prove, beyond a 

reasonable doubt, the mitigating factors do not 

outweigh the aggravating factors that have already been 

established. 

MR. KLINE: That is correct. And that is 

found in instruction number 10. And as we go through 

this process, you see that the Kansas death-penalty law 

has a default to life in virtually every stage of the 

prosecution of the case. And then, instruction number

10 is a determination by the legislature consistent 

with this Court's precedent, because we have narrowed 

the class of defendants who are eligible for death, 

consistent with Furman and the concern for guided 

discretion. And then, we have allowed the introduction 

and consideration of all mitigating evidence. The 

juror is then told how to give the effect that they 

desire, after the reasoned moral decision, to that 

mitigating evidence. As defense counsel for Mr. Marsh, 

in the transcript of the sentencing phase, on page 66, 

volume 4 -- it is not in your joint appendix, but it is 

part of the record before the Court -- stated to the 

jury in closing, "The practical fact is that each of 

you will decide whether or not you believe death is the 

appropriate sentence. And if you decide that death is 

not the appropriate sentence, you have decided that the 

mitigators outweigh the aggravators." 

What instruction number 10, which is before 

you today, which states that the State must prove 

beyond a reasonable doubt that the mitigators do not 

outweigh the aggravating factors, is, is guidance to 

the jury on how they can give the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask --

MR. KLINE: -- effect --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question and kind

of cut through -- is it a correct interpretation of the 

instructions, as a whole, to say, in effect, "If you 

find the aggravating and mitigating circumstances are 

equally balanced, you shall impose the death sentence"? 

MR. KLINE: If a juror finds -- that is 

correct, Justice Stevens -- if the juror's decided 

conclusion and reasoned moral judgment is that the 

mitigating factors and the aggravating factors are in 

balance, and finds that beyond a reasonable doubt, 

instruction number 10 clearly indicates that death is 

the appropriate sentence. So, it --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The difficulty I have is in 

the phrase that you have mentioned in the course of 

your argument a couple of times referring to the 

"reasoned moral response." And the difficulty I have 

in squaring "reasoned moral response" with the 

construction that the Kansas Court and we all agree is 

the proper construction of the -- of the -- of the 

equipoise kind of provision, is this. Kansas has a 

right, as I understand it, to define what it regards as 

the aggravating circumstances, those that support a 

death verdict. And Kansas has done so. Kansas is also 

saying that if a jury cannot find that the aggravators, 

as we've defined them, outweigh the mitigators -- i.e., 

if the jury is in equipoise -- the result must be

death, anyway. And that does not seem to be a reasoned 

moral response. I'm assuming that a reasoned moral 

response would be: the death penalty should be imposed 

because the aggravators do outweigh -- i.e., it's not 

equipoise -- the aggravators are heavier. And because 

Kansas is saying, "Even though they're not, death is 

the result, anyway," it doesn't seem like a reasoned 

moral response. What is your answer to that? 

MR. KLINE: Justice Souter, of course the 

State believes that it is. It is, first of all, 

consistent with this Court's precedent as what is 

required --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that's the issue. 

MR. KLINE: And in the -- in the Walton case, 

this Court found that a functionally identical 

provision in Arizona, even though the burden remained 

on the defendant, was appropriate after the State had 

met the requirements of guided discretion, as well as 

the individualized sentencing requirement, in setting 

about a -- proving that, "This defendant is more 

deserving of death than anybody else convicted of the 

same crime." 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But here we have, it seems 

to me, to be a stark finding that it has not been 

proven. That is what "equipoise" means. If

aggravators are the basis for a death sentence, the 

equipoise finding is, "Aggravators don't predominate. 

We cannot make that conclusion. We're right on the 

fence." And it seems to me that to call that a 

reasoned moral response -- "We're on the fence, but 

execute anyway" -- seems a total inconsistency. 

MR. KLINE: The State maintains, Justice 

Souter, that the decision that the mitigating factors 

do not outweigh the aggravating factors is a decision, 

and it is a --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's a decision that 

says, "We don't know what should be done." If 

aggravators define the basis for execution, and 

mitigators define the basis for life, the equipoise 

verdict says, in so many words, "We don't know which is 

more important." And Kansas says, when the jury comes 

back and says, "We don't know," that the result should 

be death. And that is what seems to me inconsistent 

with the notion of a reasoned moral response. 

MR. KLINE: The distinction, Justice Souter, 

that I believe, from your analogy, is that the Kansas 

Legislature has said they do know, and that death is 

appropriate once a defendant has been found guilty of 

capital murder, in a very narrow definition. And then, 

once the --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me it sounds 

different if you put it differently. Surely, it's a 

reasoned moral response to say, "We have found these 

horrible aggravating factors in this murder. It's not 

even your usual murder. There are these terrible 

aggravating factors. Three of them, we found. And we 

further find that there is no mitigating evidence to 

outweigh those aggravating factors." That seems to me 

a perfectly valid moral response. 

MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that is not our case, is 

it? Because our case is not, "We don't find that the 

mitigators outweigh." Our case is, "We find the 

mitigators are of equal weight." That's why you get to 

equipoise. It's not a question of the failure of 

mitigators to predominate. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: It is the sufficiency of 

mitigators to equal in weight. And that's what poses 

the problem, it seems to me. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it seems to me that to 

be equal in weight is not to predominate. And that's 

all the jury is saying --

MR. KLINE: I would agree, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if there's nothing to

outweigh the aggravating factors. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Of course it is not to 

predominate, but it is something more precise than 

merely not predominating. It is a fact, in effect, 

that you don't know, if all you know is that they don't 

predominate. The fact that you know, here, is that 

they equal, and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we know that as a 

fact? 

MR. KLINE: Justice Roberts, I believe that 

there are a couple of things which might help 

illuminate a little bit more what the jury faces in 

this instance. First of all, the statement --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we have a return 

of a verdict saying, "We find these factors in 

equipoise"? 

MR. KLINE: There is a verdict form that 

requires the jury, with unanimity, if the sentence is 

death, to indicate that the State has met the burden 

beyond a reasonable doubt of demonstrating --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what we have is a 

situation where this is a theoretical possibility under 

the statute. 

MR. KLINE: Correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not a situation where

this is what the jury has said. 

MR. KLINE: The jury does not find in that 

fashion. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's right. We don't --

we don't know whether that was the case here or not. 

MR. KLINE: How --

JUSTICE SOUTER: As I understand it, our 

question is, if a jury could return the death verdict 

in the equipoise situation, as the Kansas Supreme Court 

has defined it, is that -- is that statute allowing for 

that possibility constitutional? Isn't that --

MR. KLINE: That is the issue, just --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

MR. KLINE: -- as it was in Walton, which had 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

MR. KLINE: -- a functionally identical 

provision that required that the defendant demonstrate 

that there were mitigating factors substantial enough 

to call for leniency, which --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're not talking, 

just -- we're not talking about a numerical equipoise. 

I -- there's three aggravators and three mitigators, 

in equipoise. And the -- presumably, the individual 

jurors can give what weight they think is appropriate

to the mitigating factors. They can find all three 

aggravators met, and say, "Well, I still think, under 

factor 18, that mercy ought to outweigh death." 

MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice Roberts. 

And, in fact, they are informed that it is not a 

numerical equation. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But is it -- is it like in 

a -- in a -- take a civil case where the judge gives 

the standard charge about, "Imagine two plates and a 

scale, and if they are in equipoise, then you find 

against the party who has the burden of proof" -- if we 

make that comparison, then it's pretty clear that the 

burden of proof is on the defendant if the answer is --

to the equipoise question is, "Then you must come in 

with a death verdict." 

MR. KLINE: Justice Ginsburg, unlike in 

Arizona, there is a specific instruction to the jury 

that they must decide beyond a reasonable doubt that 

the mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating 

factors before the death sentence is imposed. And it 

is analogous to instructing the jury on how to give the 

effect they desire to the mitigating and aggravating 

factors that have been presented. I would possibly 

agree that we would have a constitutional issue if it 

was similar to instructing a jury, "You either mark

blue or red on the jury verdict form, and we will not 

tell you the effect of that decision." However, this 

instruction clearly lets them know that a decision 

beyond a reasonable doubt that the State has met its 

burden, that the mitigators do not outweigh the 

aggravating factors, that the effect is death. And --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is there a difference in the 

moral burden on the jurors, or the psychological burden 

on the jurors, in the situation where they have to find 

that the aggravators outweigh the mitigators, and, 

therefore, make an affirmative finding that leads to 

the sentence of death, as opposed to the situation 

where they can say, "We can't decide, under the 

applicable burden of proof, which side is weightier," 

and, therefore, they allow a default rule to dictate 

what the sentence is going to be? 

MR. KLINE: Justice Alito, I do not believe 

that that is what occurs, because, indecision, under 

Kansas law, is clearly indicative of a life sentence. 

In fact, if the jury does not, with unanimity, come 

together and make an affirmative decision, and indicate 

such on the verdict form within a reasonable time, they 

are told and instructed, "the judge shall dismiss the 

jury." And the State's --

JUSTICE ALITO: No, but if they find -- if

they agree, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the 

aggravators and the mitigators are in equipoise, then 

they allow the default rule to dictate the sentence of 

death. Isn't that right? 

MR. KLINE: That is correct, at some point. 

I wouldn't term it a "default rule" in every statutory 

scheme involving the death penalty. There is a point 

in time when the jury is informed that the result of 

their deliberations is a death sentence. So, you can 

call something a default rule in virtually any State. 

And, in fact, relying on the Walton decision, many 

States have functionally identical statutes to Kansas, 

and courts have interpreted the Walton decision as 

resolving this issue. In Adamson v. Lewis, the Ninth 

Circuit said that the issue of the potential, the 

hypothetical, of equipoise was resolved in Walton. 

Furthermore, the Idaho -- the Seventh Circuit, relating 

to the Idaho scheme relating to the death penalty, 

found that this Court resolved the issue in Walton, as 

did the Illinois Court. So, there have been several 

findings based on Walton. And, in fact, the Kansas 

Legislature enacted this death penalty statute soon 

after Walton --

you this question? Supposing the law was that you're

supposed to be instructed that, "Unless the mitigating

permissible? 

MR. KLINE: Justice Stevens, as you're aware, 

that's the Blackmun dissent in Walton, in the 

hypothetical that he posed with his concern about 

Walton. I believe that there could come a point in 

time, based on the instruction, that the jury was not 

able to give full effect to the mitigating evidence 

that they desired. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what about my 

hypothetical? 

MR. KLINE: That's -- that there -- it would

or unconstitutional?

problem with this Court's --

MR. KLINE: I'd defer to the wisdom of this 

Court. 

[Laughter.] 

JUSTICE BREYER: Leaving law out of it, which I'd 

like to do, just for the sake of argument, imagine 

you're a juror, and this is a totally contrived 

situation, which I think we're deciding -- I don't know 

if there's ever been such a situation -- but you're a 

juror, and you're told the following by a fellow juror, 

"The reason that we have these aggravating 

circumstances, which are hard to understand here, is, 

we want to be sure this fellow is, morally speaking, 

somewhat more deserving of death, than the average." 

And then he says, "And the reason that we 

have these mitigating circumstances here is because 

every one of them means that he's somewhat less moral --

he's not as morally undeserving, cuts the other way, it 

reduces -- it makes him less deserving of death, 

morally speaking." 

Now, you're the juror, how do you feel about 

this?" 

And you say, "They're absolutely in balance, 

absolutely in balance. For every fact here on the 

aggravating side that puts me thinking, morally

speaking, he's more deserving of death, there is a 

mitigating factor which makes me think, morally 

speaking, he's less deserving of death. So, I'm in 

perfect balance." 

And your fellow juror says, "Now, will you 

please give me, then, one moral reason why he should be 

executed?" 

And what's your answer? 

MR. KLINE: My answer would be that the law 

clearly provides that if that is the finding --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, but if the law says, 

"You have to be able to give, morally speaking, reason 

-- you have to reason your way towards the moral 

conclusion that he's deserving of death" -- that's why 

I tried to take the law out of it. I don't want you to 

be a lawyer. I want you to be a juror. And I want you 

to give a moral reason --

MR. KLINE: The moral reason would be --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- why, when this is in 

equipoise, he is more deserving of death than the 

average. 

MR. KLINE: Justice Breyer, I would say that 

the moral reason is, "I know the effect of that 

deliberation, and I know that, if I make that finding, 

that the death sentence will be warranted."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and of course --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the jury doesn't have a 

free-falling moral judgment to make. It accepts the 

judgment of the majority of the people in Kansas that 

certain aggravators, and only those aggravators, shall 

be counted against the defendant --

MR. KLINE: And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and that all of them 

shall be -- even if the juror himself does not believe, 

morally, that this particular aggravator ought to be 

there. So, it's not as though our law says that 

somehow the jury has to -- each juror has to be able to 

make, like Solomon, his own moral judgment on this 

fellow. And one of the things that the -- that the 

Kansas law prescribes is that when they're in 

equipoise, the people of Kansas think that the 

aggravators that they have specified are serious enough 

that unless there is something to overcome them, the 

death penalty is appropriate. That seems to me a moral 

judgment within the limited range of moral judgment 

that the jury is accorded. 

MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice Scalia. 

And the concern about unfettered moral judgment of a 

jury calls into question the original purpose for

Furman. And so, there is guided discretion --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, they have 

unfettered discretion with respect to the mitigating 

factors, don't they? Under --

MR. KLINE: That is correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- under factor 18, 

any other circumstance which they find serves as a 

basis for a sentence other than death. 

MR. KLINE: That is correct, Justice --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I take it --

MR. KLINE: -- Mr. Chief Justice. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the moral answer is 

also, "He stands before us with the scales already 

tipped. He stands before us having been shown, beyond 

a reasonable doubt, to have committed aggravated 

murder. He has the obligation to show us why he should 

be excused from that penalty. He has not done so. We 

can take anything that he came -- brought to our 

attention, and we can say that this outweighs." It 

does not. 

MR. KLINE: And, Justice Kennedy, that is the 

decision in the holding in Walton. And --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that the law in Kansas? 

I mean, I thought -- correct me if I'm wrong, because I 

may have made a wrong assumption here -- I thought the

finding of guilt to an aggravated murder is the preface 

to a determination as to whether aggravators or 

mitigators predominate. And, based upon that 

determination, there will be a decision as to whether 

the sentence should be death or life. 

MR. KLINE: The first determination that a 

jury engages in is whether the defendant has been 

proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, guilty of capital 

murder --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. 

MR. KLINE: -- which is defined in a very 

narrow statute. Kansas --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And, at that point, we don't 

have any way of knowing, I take it, whether the penalty 

should be life or death. 

MR. KLINE: Then we have -- you're correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. KLINE: And then we have a separate 

sentencing phase in which the State first bears the 

burden of demonstrating one -- eight -- of eight 

aggravating factors is present. And that burden is 

beyond a reasonable doubt --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But --

MR. KLINE: -- with jury unanimity.

 MR. KLINE: And --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- what I'm -- what I'm --

what I'm getting at is, I don't -- I -- as I understand 

the Kansas scheme, the determination of guilt, to 

aggravated murder, does not create a presumption in 

favor of the death penalty. 

MR. KLINE: No, the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. KLINE: -- that is correct. That is 

correct. There are several steps. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what you mean 

by a "presumption." It certainly -- it certainly says 

that unless you find something that outweighs this, the 

death penalty is the proper penalty. 

MR. KLINE: Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The burden is on the jury to 

find something to outweigh it. And, in the absence of 

a finding of something that outweighs it, when these 

aggravators are found, the death penalty is the proper 

penalty. 

MR. KLINE: Justice Scalia, that is correct. 

Once the State has met the burden of proving that one 

of the eight statutory aggravators is present --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. But the fact of --

let me -- I think we've got a terminological problem --

the fact that there has been a finding of guilt of 

aggravated murder is not tantamount, as I understand 

it, to a finding that aggravating factors to be 

considered at the penalty phase have also been found. 

Is that --

MR. KLINE: That is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- correct? 

MR. KLINE: -- correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. KLINE: There is a separate burden there 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. KLINE: -- Justice Souter. And as it 

relates to the "give effect" language, the cases that 

this Court has considered regarding that are 

dramatically different. In those cases, such as the 

Penry cases and other cases, the concern was, the jury 

was affirmatively instructed that they could not use 

evidence that was introduced and relevant in a manner 

which would lead to mitigation, such as the defendant's 

youthfulness. And the special instruction in Texas 

said that they could only utilize that evidence to 

determine whether there was a likelihood of re-offense. 

And this Court reasoned that it is possible to look at 

youthfulness as mitigating factor which diminishes the

moral culpability of the defendant. There is no claim 

in this case that the jurors were unable to take the 

mitigating evidence and give it whatever effect they 

desired in mitigation. In fact, they are instructed 

that they must individually consider all such evidence. 

And then they are instructed to make their decision 

based upon what effect that they would give it. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can --

MR. KLINE: So --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you a question 

that goes to your response to Justice Souter's last 

question? As I understand the scheme, maybe my 

understanding is wrong, once they have found the 

existence of those aggravating factors that justify the 

death penalty, and then you move into the penalty phase 

for them to decide whether, in fact, the death penalty 

would be imposed, it's not up to them to -- they can't 

eliminate one of those aggravating factors that has 

been found. They have to take into account all of the 

aggravating factors that have been found. Isn't that 

right? 

MR. KLINE: That's correct, Justice Scalia. 

I think the confusion is the use of the term 

"aggravated murder," which would be not quite correct 

under Kansas law. There is a statutory requirement of

a finding of guilt of capital murder, and that is in 

very narrow circumstances. Kansas has one of the most 

narrow death penalties in the Nation. Then once that 

guilt is determined, we then move to the phase where 

the State must prove an aggravating factor in addition 

to having proved that the defendant is guilty of 

capital murder. 

Once that is achieved, then the 

jurors are instructed to give way to a consideration to 

all aggravating factors that they find, with unanimity, 

to exist, and to consider all mitigating evidence which 

they find, individually, to exist, with the only burden 

on the defendant being relevancy for introduction. And 

then, they are instructed to consider whether the State 

has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the 

mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating 

factors. 

And, Mr. Chief Justice, if it may please the 

Court, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.

Kline.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REBECCA E. WOODMAN

please the Court: 

Since the argument of the attorney general 

was addressed exclusively to the question of the 

constitutionality of the Kansas statute, I will devote 

all of my argument to that subject, as well, although I 

am sure that the Court, in deliberations, will be 

considering the several jurisdictional issues which 

were briefed and argued earlier in the term. And if 

there are no questions on those jurisdictional issues, 

I will proceed to the merits. 

To pick up on some of the things that were 

said during Attorney General Kline's argument, the 

Eighth Amendment requires reliability in the 

determination that death is an appropriate sentence. 

And at the selection stage, the question is whether the 

jury has made a reliable, collective, responsible 

decision based upon the unique circumstances of the 

individual defendant that death is an appropriate 

sentence and that this defendant is particularly 

culpable in a way that distinguishes him from the mass 

of death-eligible defendants. And the problem with the 

equipoise provision here, which the State agrees can 

occur under the Kansas statute, is that we don't know 

from a death verdict pronounced by a jury in Kansas 

whether the jury did decree death by equipoise or not.

Death sentences must be rationally reviewable. And 

when we look at the -- at a death sentence that's been 

pronounced in Kansas, we can't determine whether the 

jury decreed death by equipoise. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: We are confident that the 

jury found aggravating factors. We know that. 

MS. WOODMAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And we know --

MS. WOODMAN: Yes, and I agree --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that they found them 

beyond a reasonable doubt. 

MS. WOODMAN: Yes. The jury did find an 

aggravating factor beyond --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And we know --

MS. WOODMAN: -- a reasonable --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- we --

MS. WOODMAN: -- doubt. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and we know that they 

found that the defendant had not shown that mitigating 

factors outweighed those aggravating factors. 

MS. WOODMAN: That's right. But the Kansas 

Supreme Court, in the Kleypas case, examined the Kansas 

statute -- which, by the way, is unique to Kansas; no 

other State in the country has a statute like this, and 

this will affect no State outside of Kansas -- they

examined this statute in great detail, and they --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You disagree from your --

with your friend on the other side on that point. 

MS. WOODMAN: Whether it's unique? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: How can we check on that? 

No, he said that a number of other State statutes would 

be affected by our coming out the way you would like 

us, on this. 

MS. WOODMAN: I don't see how, because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Because he said --

MS. WOODMAN: -- Kansas --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- he said it would change 

Walton, and that would impair those other State 

statutes. 

MS. WOODMAN: As we argue in our brief, 

Walton simply did not speak to this --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MS. WOODMAN: -- issue. And, in fact, the 

Arizona Supreme Court, in Walton, interpreted the 

Arizona statute to require that aggravators outweigh 

mitigators. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't mean to 

interrupt your argument, but presumably the attorney 

general will tell us, in his rebuttal. 

MS. WOODMAN: Sure. And the Montana statute,

which reads precisely the way Arizona's is, they've 

decided the equipoise issue and said that the language 

of that statute does not mandate death by equipoise. 

So, those statutes are distinguishable, and there's 

simply no other State that has a statute which mandates 

death by equipoise. 

In any event, the Kansas Supreme Court did 

interpret the statute to contain a mandatory death-by-

equipoise provision, which the State's question 

presented assumes is the case. And the court, familiar 

with the way the statute has operated, and is likely to 

operate it in Kansas, found that equipoise can happen, 

and that it risks unreliability in capital sentencing 

in a way that's forbidden by the Eighth Amendment. And 

I think one of the problems here is that the 

terminology of "weighing" conveys a false impression of 

predefined weights. And the attorney general conceded 

that that's not how juries consider the balancing of 

aggravating and mitigating circumstances. And we agree 

with that. And that's why it is wrong to view this as 

principally a burden-of-proof issue. It's not. The 

issue, at the selection stage -- the State certainly 

has the burden to prove an aggravating circumstance 

beyond a reasonable doubt, but, at the selection stage, 

the issue is not meeting some particular burden of

proof, it's whether the jury has made a reliable, 

responsible, collective decision that this unique 

defendant deserves the death penalty that distinguishes 

him --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that --

MS. WOODMAN: -- from other death-eligible --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that that --

MS. WOODMAN: -- defendants. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that that hurts you 

somewhat. If you want to give us this visual metaphor 

of a scale, or a football field, where you move it 

beyond the 50-yardline, whatever visual metaphor you 

want, and you weigh, you balance where the scales of 

justice balances, it seems to me that that's a stronger 

case than saying the jurors can establish their 

aggravation, then they can take any mitigating factor 

they want, for any reason, and apply it. And they 

can't do that, because the defendant hasn't shown it. 

It seems to me that that's -- that that's a weaker 

argument than if you had this balancing mechanism that 

was our controlling metaphor. 

MS. WOODMAN: Well, let's look at the way 

that equipoise can happen under the Kansas statute --

and I think Justice Alito alluded to it -- that if the 

jurors can't decide between aggravated and mitigating

circumstances, the sentence is death. The statute 

decrees death, and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: They've already decided 

aggravating circumstances, you can't say they can't decide it. 

They've already decided aggravating circumstances. 

MS. WOODMAN: They've decided --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what they're deciding 

is that there's no mitigating circumstances to outweigh 

it. 

MS. WOODMAN: What they've decided is that, 

in looking at aggravating and mitigating circumstances 

together, they can't determine, one way or the other, 

whether aggravators outweigh mitigators or mitigators --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But --

MS. WOODMAN: -- outweigh aggravators. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But how realistic is 

that as a possibility when you're talking about 

abstract concepts as mitigating factors, like how much 

mercy should be shown? I mean, do you really think 

there's any juror who's going to say, "All right, I'm 

giving -- I've found the aggravating circumstance that 

he killed two people, and I've found the aggravating 

circumstance that it was particularly heinous to slash 

the throat and leave the toddler to burn. But I also 

think that mercy ought to be shown. But, you know, it

just happens to come up to exactly the level of the 

aggravating circumstances. So, I'm stuck. I don't 

know what to do." I don't think that's the way jurors 

would react. They either think that the need to show 

mercy or, the one before that, that he's a talented 

artist, outweighs the fact of the aggravating 

circumstances, or it doesn't. I just think it's an 

unrealistic supposition. And there's nothing in the 

statute -- they don't get an equipoise instruction. 

So, how -- I mean, is there any reason to think that 

jurors do come to that balance between such inchoate 

concepts in the first place? 

MS. WOODMAN: Yes. I think it can occur in 

close cases. And, after all, those are the only cases 

where equipoise would even be relevant. And let me 

give you an example. Suppose there's a woman who wants 

to donate a million dollars to Yale Law School, and, as 

part of that donation, she's going to -- she has --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that an aggravating 

circumstance? 

[Laughter.] 

MS. WOODMAN: Well, bear with me for a 

minute, Your Honor. She has to choose a portrait of 

her beloved husband to hang in the law school. These 

portraits were taken at different times, they have

different qualities, different features. And she has 

to choose one. And this decision proves 

extraordinarily difficult for her to make. And she 

compares the relative qualities of the two portraits. 

They're both good. She loved her husband. And she 

simply cannot choose between the two. And so, she does 

one of two things. One is that she just can't bear to 

debate with herself anymore about which one is the 

better-quality portrait; and so, she becomes agnostic 

about it and says, "I give up. Pick one." And so, she 

picks one. The other is that the decision is simply 

too difficult for her to make; and so, she abdicates 

that decision and says, "Let the dean pick." 

And you can analogize that to the ways in 

which this statute can operate. And the jury can 

arrive at equipoise by becoming agnostic about the 

decision on whether -- on the balance between 

aggravating/mitigating --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think your --

MS. WOODMAN: -- circumstances. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think your analogy 

took away what I would have regarded as the basis for 

my question. I think it may well be true that people 

have difficulty deciding between two portraits. I'm 

not sure people come to the sense that someone who's

guilty of allowing a 19-month-old to burn to death and 

slashing the throat of her mother thinks it's equally 

balanced when they're inclined to show mercy, for 

whatever reason. It seems to me they either make a 

determination that the circumstances of his upbringing, 

emotional instability outweigh the responsibility for 

what they had found to be aggravating factors, or they 

determine that the aggravating factors outweigh the 

fact that they may show mercy for other basis. I just 

-- I can see thinking two portraits are 

indistinguishable. I just don't see a juror 

functioning and saying, "I just can't decide whether to 

show mercy or to convict for death." And they're 

equally balanced. I understand the idea they may 

debate it with the other jurors, but, to come and say, 

"You know, I just can't decide," it seems to me that 

the -- particularly since they can put as much weight 

into the mitigating factors as they want -- they can 

say, "I want to show a lot of mercy," they can say, "I 

want to show a little bit of mercy" -- but to say that, 

"I want to show just enough mercy that is exactly 

balanced," I don't understand that. 

MS. WOODMAN: Well, you see, individual 

jurors, in the course of deliberations -- this is a 

qualitative judgment, after all, and individual jurors,

in the course of deliberations, might be leaning one 

way or the other at different times during 

deliberations. But what this equipoise provision does 

is that it allows the jurors to compromise on equipoise 

when they simply cannot deliberate anymore, or if they 

simply just want to avoid making the hard decision. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Would it be constitutional if 

the Kansas statute said that, "The jury must find, by a 

preponderance, that the aggravating factors outweigh 

the mitigating factors"? 

MS. WOODMAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE ALITO: And wouldn't a defendant be 

better off under the current Kansas statute than under 

a statute like that, where, under the current statute, 

the jury has to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that 

the aggravating factors and the mitigating factors are 

at least in equipoise? 

MS. WOODMAN: Well, the jury does have to 

find equipoise beyond a reasonable doubt. But the fact 

remains that the jury is making that decision of 

equipoise, which requires the death sentence, without 

having made the individualized sentencing determination 

required at the selection stage under the Eighth 

Amendment. And that's the problem with the equipoise 

provision, because it allows the jury to avoid making

that decision, which is --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I mean --

MS. WOODMAN: -- required. 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- suppose the jury thinks 

that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating 

factors 51-49. Now, under the first statute that I 

hypothesized, that would result in a verdict of death, 

would it not? What would the result be under the --

under the current Kansas statute, where the aggravators 

have to be shown, beyond a reasonable doubt, to 

outweigh the mitigators? 

MS. WOODMAN: Well, I think if the statute 

requires that the aggravators outweigh mitigators, this 

Court has upheld that formula. That is a decision that 

the jury has made. And the legislature can make that 

decision. And so, when you look -- that's why I'm 

trying to -- I mean, the State agrees that this is not 

a quantitative determination. And I will grant you, if 

the jury is -- if it were a quantitative determination, 

which is totally unrealistic, and we agree with the 

State's reasoning on that -- then if the jury is 

precisely exactly equivalent, 50-50, on aggravating and 

mitigating circumstances, that might be said to 

constitute a decision. But, as even the State argues, 

that's not how jury deliberations work. And under this

equipoise provision, the jury can decree death without 

having made the individualized sentencing decision 

required at the selection stage. And it's because, on 

the one hand, if the decision is too close to call, the 

equipoise provision allows the jurors to simply give up 

and settle on equipoise as a group. This is a group 

decision, after all. They have to be unanimous on the 

question of whether aggravators --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you --

MS. WOODMAN: -- are not --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question? 

MS. WOODMAN: -- outweighed by mitigators. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Suppose the jurors are 

deadlocked, six to six, and you're not -- you don't 

know, maybe some are a little stronger there, but 

there's a deadlock. And what if the judge told them, 

"Well, in the event of a deadlock, you resolve it by 

flipping a coin." Would that be constitutional? 

MS. WOODMAN: Absolutely not, because they're 

not making the decision that's required at the 

selection stage. 

And to follow up on something that General 

Kline said during his argument, that the provision is 

for a hung jury, there's no provision for a hung jury 

in the event the jury finds itself in equipoise. The

only provision for a hung jury, under the Kansas 

statute, is if the jury is unable to reach a verdict. 

But equipoise, does not prevent a death verdict. In 

fact, the statute requires a death verdict if the 

jurors are in equipoise. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the verdict that 

the jury returns is a verdict of death. They do not 

return a verdict saying, "We're in equipoise," and then 

the death sentence is imposed by operation of law. The 

verdict imposed is, "We do not find -- we find these 

aggravating circumstances. We find they're not 

outweighed. And, therefore, we sentence the defendant 

to death." 

MS. WOODMAN: Well, a determination of 

equipoise -- the jury has to find equipoise beyond a 

reasonable doubt, and that, necessarily, means that the 

aggravators are not outweighed my mitigators. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but --

MS. WOODMAN: That's how this statute was 

interpreted by the Kansas Supreme Court. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but I think -- I think 

the Chief Justice's point is that you're -- you're 

really not being accurate when you say, "The jurors can 

thereby avoid the difficult choice." They don't avoid 

the difficult choice. They're fully aware, under this

statutory scheme, that if they don't find that the 

mitigators outweigh, they are condemning this person to 

death. That's the moral choice they're faced with. 

And when they come in with that verdict, they know what 

they're doing. And I consider that a moral -- a moral 

judgment on their part. 

MS. WOODMAN: Well, the jury certainly knows 

that they are imposing a death sentence. But what this 

instruction and the prosecutorial arguments given in 

the cases tell them is that they can fulfill their 

responsibilities as jurors without coming to a final 

judgment about whether aggravators outweigh mitigators, 

or vice versa. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And you think that a juror 

who believes that this person shouldn't be -- shouldn't 

be sent to death -- that is to say, who believes that 

the mitigators outweigh the aggravators -- would join a 

jury verdict which produces the result that he's 

sentenced to death, right? I think that is so unlikely 

MS. WOODMAN: But in --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that he's going to say, 

"Well, I -- you know, I think he shouldn't go to death, 

but the aggravators and mitigators are absolutely 

evenly balanced, so I guess I've got to send him to

death," I don't think any juror's going to do that. 

MS. WOODMAN: But the fact that this is a 

group decision leads to even a greater risk of 

abdication of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It takes only one --

MS. WOODMAN: -- that decision. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It takes only one to 

disagree. 

MS. WOODMAN: But it's a group decision, and 

jurors are encouraged and forced to compromise to come 

to a verdict. And in close cases, with jurors leaning 

slightly one way or another, they, being forced to come 

to a consensus, are even more likely to compromise on 

equipoise, rather than engage in the draining task of 

persuading each person leaning one way or the other to 

come together. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But regardless of the 

likelihood of that situation in any given case -- and I 

happen to agree with Justice Scalia; I mean, I don't 

think the likelihood of that in a given case is great --

we're, nonetheless, I think, faced with the fact that 

the Supreme Court of Kansas says, "That can happen." 

MS. WOODMAN: Absolutely. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: "And if it does happen, the 

result is death." And I think we've --

MS. WOODMAN: That's right. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- do you see any way out of 

it? I --

MS. WOODMAN: That's right. This Court is 

bound by the Kansas Supreme Court's interpretation of 

the statute. And what's happening here is, when the 

jurors do settle on equipoise, in whatever way they 

settle on equipoise, the fact of the matter that -- is 

that in either of -- either of the two cases I've --

well, either in -- in three cases I've described, the 

jurors are following their instructions, and, in either 

of these situations, the defendant is being sentenced 

to death only as a death-eligible defendant, because 

that's the only constitutionally required decision 

that's actually been made by the jury in that 

situation. And to go back to Justice Breyer's 

hypothetical about the box from the last argument, the 

legislature has determined that the individuals will be 

separated out as a result of equipoise, but there is 

nothing about that situation, them being in that box, 

that separates them from any other generic death-

eligible defendant. And that's the problem with this

equipoise provision. And, yes, the Kansas Supreme 

Court found that it can happen. This Court is bound by 

that interpretation. The State concedes that. And, 

therefore --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You mentioned the --

MS. WOODMAN: The --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- Kansas Legislature. Has 

there been any suggestion the statute ought to be 

amended to get rid of this silly little problem? 

MS. WOODMAN: Yes.

MS. WOODMAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- silly little problem,

MS. WOODMAN: Yes, and I think --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- the very narrow --

MS. WOODMAN: -- the Legislature is going to 

take that up again. And there's simply no consequence 

to anyone else by affirming the Kansas Supreme Court's 

decision in this case. The Legislature is going to 

take the matter up again. There's no question about 

that.

when they take it up again? 

[Laughter.] 

MS. WOODMAN: Well, I wouldn't want to 

speculate on that. There are going to be arguments on 

both sides, certainly. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What if they still conclude, 

as they did before, that when these aggravating factors 

are found, unless there is mitigation to overcome them, 

it is the judgment of the people of Kansas that this 

person is deserving of death? What if they come to 

that conclusion again? You want us to tell them, "No, 

the people of Kansas cannot come to that, what seems to 

me, quite rational decision"? 

MS. WOODMAN: Well, but there is no moral 

judgment, as has been stated here. There's no moral 

judgment. The State can -- the Legislature can 

determine that death is an appropriate sentence. The 

Legislature -- this Court upheld a legislative 

determination, when aggravators outweigh mitigators, in 

Blystone, that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's so silly to say that 

Kansas can circumscribe the moral judgment of the -- of 

the jury by saying, "You can take into account 18

aggravators, or else only two aggravators." That is a 

-- you know, a significant control on their moral 

judgment. But then to say that Kansas cannot 

circumscribe their moral judgment to the very limited 

degree of saying, "Unless you find that the mitigators 

outweigh the aggravators, the proper response is the 

death penalty." 

MS. WOODMAN: But you cannot divorce the 

weighing process enacted by the legislature from the 

individualized sentencing decision required under the 

Eighth Amendment at the selection stage. And the 

equipoise --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If I -- if I may interrupt

MS. WOODMAN: And if the Legislature --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But haven't the jurors made 

the decision that, "We have looked at all of the moral 

arguments that he has presented. Each of one of the --

of us has individually weighed them. Each one of us

know that if we have any moral reason not to impose the

judgment that we cannot make that determination." 

MS. WOODMAN: But the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Moral judgment, from 

beginning to end. 

MS. WOODMAN: This statute allows a third 

option of equipoise, which allows a jury to impose 

death without making that judgment. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, well, what do you say 

to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but that's -- your term 

is "equipoise." You say the jury has done nothing --

MS. WOODMAN: The Kansas Supreme Court's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you say the jury has 

done nothing. What the jury has done is, it's weighed 

all the evidence with great care, and it's said that, 

"Beyond a reasonable doubt, the mitigating 

circumstances do not overcome." That is a moral 

judgment. 

MS. WOODMAN: But the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you label it 

"equipoise." 

MS. WOODMAN: The other possibilities are 

that the jury has found that, "We can't decide whether

is saying, when they make that determination, "We can't 

tell whether one outweighs the other," that they are 

making a moral judgment there. And what's your --

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But the difficulty, I think, 

in the case is, it's artificial. I think it is. We're 

in an artificial situation, and we're imagining those 

12 jurors saying they're in equipoise between 

mitigating and aggravating. We don't know. They --

even. All right. Now, you could look at this as 

saying, "You have to have a reason for thinking these 

people are -- this person is morally worse than the 

average." And then we imagine some fungible commodity, 

like moral badness units. And for every one we go up 

on the aggravating side, we go down on the mitigating 

side, so we're back to zero. And then, some people, 

like you, are looking at this and saying, "See, you're 

at zero. You went up, you went down, so they're no 

worse than the average." But other people can look at 

it and say, "We'll tell you about -- one thing about 

this individual. This is an individual who did do the 

aggravating things, and he has counterbalancing 

mitigating things, and that's good enough to separate 

him out, morally speaking, from somebody who doesn't. 

Now, my problem is, you either look at it the 

one way or you look at the other way, and you -- and 

I'm trying to find a reasoned -- if you -- can -- do 

you want to add anything?

 MS. WOODMAN: Well, I mean, the Kansas 

Supreme Court determined that equipoise can happen. 

And in the situations that I've described, there is a 

real risk under this statute that the jury can either 

become agnostic and just pick, and the statute requires 

them to pick death, or the jury, encouraged by 

prosecutorial arguments to abdicate the decision, do 

abdicate, simply cop out and impose death, because it 

allows them to avoid making the tough choice. And I 

think those are very real possibilities under this 

statute. The statute requires death in those 

situations, and it's the risk that this procedure poses 

that presents the problem. And this Court has always 

held that these kinds of risks of unconstitutional 

results are intolerable in capital cases. And we 

simply cannot look at a death sentence in Kansas and 

say, with any reliability at all, that this jury did 

not decree death by equipoise, that this jury made the 

reliable sentencing judgment required under the Eighth 

Amendment at the selection stage. We just can't say 

that under this statute. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think that under this 

instruction, a Kansas juror could say, "You know, I'm 

not interested in deliberating more. I'm not going to 

participate"? That's what you're want -- that's what

you want us to believe, right, based on this argument? 

I -- that's just -- any juror -- any jury can ignore 

its instructions. There's nothing I can do about that. 

MS. WOODMAN: Well, they're not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Here, they are instructed 

to consider every mitigating circumstance that's 

presented and determine whether or not that should be a 

factor in their decision. 

MS. WOODMAN: They're not -- they're not 

ignoring their instructions at all. They're following 

their instructions if they arrive at equipoise. And 

the instructions and the prosecutorial arguments tell 

them to impose death. The prosecutorial --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well --

MS. WOODMAN: -- arguments are --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you're suggesting 

that they kind of --

MS. WOODMAN: -- perfectly in line. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that they can tune out. 

MS. WOODMAN: It's not that they're tuning 

out. They take their jobs very seriously. But what 

they are encouraged to believe by the instructions and 

the prosecutorial arguments is that they will fulfill 

their responsibilities as jurors without coming to a 

final judgment on whether aggravators outweigh

mitigators or vice versa. And it's the risk that they

And the Kansas Supreme Court determined that there is 

such a risk of equipoise under this statute that it 

cannot comply with the Eighth Amendment. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Ms. 

Woodman. 

General Kline, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILL KLINE 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. KLINE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

First, referring to Justice Scalia's question 

as it relates to other States that are affected, in the 

joint appendix, pages 98 through 107, you have a 

summary, and, additionally, in the amici brief that was 

filed by several States, on page 23, it identifies 

Arizona, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and 

Missouri as having similar provisions. And, 

additionally, the cases that have relied on Walton to 

determine that the equipoise issue has been resolved 

are the Eleventh Circuit, in Jones v. Dugger, the 

Arizona Supreme Court. And in State v. Gretzler, they 

found that the provision provided for equipoise, as 

well as in Idaho, in State v. Hoffman.

 As it relates to a juror somehow imposing 

death when they are undecided, I would direct you to 

page 26 of the joint appendix, at instruction number 9, 

which reads, "The Defendant is entitled to the 

individual opinion of each juror. Each of you must 

consider the evidence for the purpose of reaching a 

verdict. Each of you must decide the case for 

yourself." 

Furthermore, the jury is instructed, in 

instruction number 12 in the second paragraph on page 

28 of the joint appendix, that, "In order to reach a 

verdict in the case, your decision must be unanimous. 

And then, after reasonable deliberation, if you are 

unable to reach a unanimous verdict, you shall notify 

the Court, and the result is a life sentence." 

Kansas law is very clear that death is only 

appropriate in the singular instance in which a jury 

has found beyond a reasonable doubt with unanimity that 

the defendant is guilty of capital murder, that an 

aggravating factor exists, and then that the mitigating 

factors do not outweigh the aggravating factors. 

It was in 1994 that the Kansas Legislature 

passed the death penalty in Kansas, a few years after 

the Walton decision. And I was there for the debate, 

as a legislator. It was a compelling moment, not just

because of the result, but the solemnity and 

seriousness of the debate in which they were seeking to 

define, through their reasoned moral judgment, what 

justice demands in instances such as this. 

And recognizing this Court as the final 

arbiter of the meaning of the Eighth Amendment, you 

will see, through pages 23 through 28 of your appendix, 

your words mirrored back to you. The Legislature has 

respected your judgment and made the reasoned moral 

decision that death is appropriate in the instances --

JUSTICE ALITO: Was there a particular --

MR. KLINE: -- that we are discussing. 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- was there a reason why 

they provided that, in the case of equipoise, the 

sentence would be death? Or is that just a quirk of 

the way the provision was written? 

MR. KLINE: In the debate, all of these 

decisions were discussed through committee as well as 

on the legislative floor. And the belief was, in these 

various aggravated and narrow circumstances, that the 

State believes death is appropriate. And if we 

followed the individualized sentencing line of these 

cases and allowed a jury to consider all of the 

mitigating evidence that is relevant, that the State 

could make that decision.
