3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next in Case 07-455, United States versus Ressam. 

General Mukasey. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. MICHAEL B. MUKASEY 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  GENERAL MUKASEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

9 it please the Court:

 The question in this case is whether a panel 

11 of the Ninth Circuit was correct when it added the words 

12 "in relation to," and thereby added an element to 

13 section 844 of Title 18, and we think for at least four 

14 reasons, the answer to that question is no.

 First, and principally, those words are not 

16 in the statute that Congress wrote, and this Court has 

17 said many times that courts should not add words or 

18 elements to criminal statutes. 

19  Second, Congress knows how to include a 

relational element when it wants to, and in fact, did 

21 that in section 924(c) after which section 844 is 

22 otherwise patterned. And that shows that when Congress 

23 chose to leave "in relation to" out of section 844 it 

24 did that intentionally.

 Third, when section 844 was amended in 1988,

1 one court of appeals, the only court of appeals to rule 

2 directly on the question of whether there was a 

3 relationship between the carrying of explosives in the 

4 commission of a felony, had held that there was no 

relational element. Congress was on notice of that 

6 fact -­

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your argument relies 

8 on the notion that the word "during" in the statute is 

9 solely temporal. In other words, it just refers to the 

time? 

11  GENERAL MUKASEY: Correct. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- that's not 

13 always the case. If I say, you know, I hung lights 

14 during the holiday season, you wouldn't think that I 

hung a chandelier, right? There'd be not simply a 

16 temporal connection, but also a relation. 

17  GENERAL MUKASEY: In that instance, that 

18 would be correct. On the other hand, when Congress in 

19 -- in 924(c) said "during and in relation to," it meant 

something more than a temporal relationship. It did not 

21 say the same thing in 844, and it failed to say the same 

22 thing in 844(f) or the amended 924(c). 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: General, could -- could 

24 Congress pass a law that said if you wear a wristwatch 

during the commission of any crime, you get another 10 

4

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 years? 

2  GENERAL MUKASEY: A statute like that would 

3 be entirely unreasonable. It was not entirely 

4 unreasonable for Congress to have said if you carry an 

explosive during the commission of a felony, you've 

6 added something enormously volatile. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Surely it depends on what 

8 the felony is. If the felony is the filing of a 

9 dishonest tax return and -- and you have a can of 

gasoline with you when you mail the letter, it seems to 

11 me quite as absurd as saying wearing a wristwatch in the 

12 course of a felony. That's what troubles me about this. 

13  I'm -- I'm tempted to -- I think everybody 

14 is tempted to distort the "during" to -- to mean 

something else, simply because the consequences of 

16 performing a completely lawful act wearing a wristwatch, 

17 carrying explosives -- given the broad definition of 

18 explosives, I guess it would include having -- having 

19 some cartridges, explosive cartridges?

 GENERAL MUKASEY: It would. But the 

21 temptation -­

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's perfectly lawful, 

23 and you get another 10 years for it just because you're 

24 -- you're mailing a letter to the IRS at the same time.

 GENERAL MUKASEY: It is perfectly lawful.

1 Congress was aware that Title 18, not to mention all the 

2 other titles, are chockablock with felonies. There are 

3 thousands of them out there. But nonetheless, it wanted 

4 to make sure that the mainstream that it was concerned 

with, which is nicely illustrated by the facts of this 

6 case, were taken care of; and so it passed a very broad 

7 statute. We concede that it was a very broad statute. 

8 "Any felony" couldn't be broader. 

9  But that was Congress's choice. And if 

Congress chooses to amend the statute, respectfully, it 

11 ought to be Congress that amends it. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Mukasey, is there 

13 any indication why this prosecutor chose to hook the 

14 carrying an explosive onto a false-statement charge, 

instead of some charges with which it would have been 

16 more logically linked, like the one -- the first one, 

17 conspiracy to commit an act of terror -- terrorism? 

18  GENERAL MUKASEY: There is. At the time the 

19 case was brought, there was evidence to charge the first 

count, conspiracy to commit a terrorist act. There were 

21 some evidentiary problems; a great deal of the evidence 

22 to support that count did not, in fact, come until 

23 almost literally the eve of trial. A lot of it came 

24 from overseas.

 The count to which the -- the 844 -- the 

6

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 crime to which 844 was, in fact, passed, the making of a 

2 false statement, was, to use a colloquialism, a 

3 lead-pipe cinch. He had clearly made a false statement. 

4 He had clearly carried an explosive while doing it.

 That prosecutor's decision, in fact, was a 

6 very responsible one, because what was shown when they 

7 opened his trunk was that this was a very dangerous 

8 person; and they wanted to bring a charge on which they 

9 were sure to convict him, so that his carrying of the 

explosive would get him ten years in addition to that 

11 charge. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I guess what's troubling 

13 me, Mr. Attorney General, is that it -- it does seem to 

14 me fair enough to make that charge in this case; but 

then we -- but then we have the tremendous number of 

16 cases where the prosecutor is going to be in the 

17 position in a plea-bargain context, say, to threaten to 

18 charge this offense with a heavy mandatory minimum. 

19  My understanding is that district judges do 

not and cannot be involved in plea bargain negotiations; 

21 they can look at a plea before it is entered. 

22  What can you tell us about the safeguards 

23 that might exist in the system generally against -­

24 against overcharging, against charging for something 

where the result is close to absurd, as in some of these

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 hypotheticals about the income tax return and the 

2 gasoline and so forth? 

3  GENERAL MUKASEY: The safeguard -- the 

4 safeguard that is in the system, in part, involves the 

history of the system. Rosenberg was decided, I 

6 believe, in 1986. That's 22 years ago. There's been 

7 no, as far as I know, recorded outbreak of this sort of 

8 thing any place, in the Third Circuit or any place else. 

9 And it seems to me that a defendant would be able to 

challenge that kind of threat, that kind of application, 

11 or at least make it known. 

12  We haven't received any notification that 

13 that's -- that that's going on, although there have been 

14 charges of -- under 844(h), relating to ammunition. But 

that's scarcely -- that's scarcely a marginal case. 

16  The hypothetical of the fellow with the -­

17 with the firecracker in his back pocket who is 

18 simultaneously in possession of a $20 counterfeit 

19 bill has no -­

JUSTICE BREYER: General, that is -- my 

21 question would be the converse. Suppose I agreed with 

22 you to this point hypothetically that, of course, 

23 there's a relationship here. In this case, there's a 

24 relationship. He wouldn't have lied if he -- if he 

hadn't had the explosives. Suppose I accept that.

1  Now, if I interpret the statute that way -­

2 there has to be a relationship, but including that -­

3 then what are the other cases you want to prosecute? 

4  In the other briefs they list every funny or 

comical or absurd example they can find; and so I don't 

6 believe you want to prosecute those, but tell me if you 

7 do. And if there are some other ones, what are they? 

8  GENERAL MUKASEY: We don't, but, 

9 respectfully, "relationship" doesn't mean in a statute 

what "relationship" means in conversation. It means 

11 facilitation under a knife. It means that -­

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. So suppose, in other 

13 words, if we -- if, hypothetically, I were to say, well, 

14 here there's a relationship; after all, it is a 

necessary condition for the lying that he was carrying 

16 explosives; and it is foreseeable that he would lie on 

17 his passport, because he was carrying explosives 

18 illegally. So that's all you need. 

19  In other words, if that were the decision, 

you would say fine, that's the end of it. 

21  GENERAL MUKASEY: It was -- his carrying of 

22 explosives did not facilitate his lying in this case. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: No, it didn't facilitate 

24 it, but it caused it.

 GENERAL MUKASEY: Maybe it caused it, and

1 maybe it didn't. 

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it didn't -- all 

3 right. Would you be satisfied with a result that says, 

4 look, if this carrying of explosives is related to the 

felony in the sense that it is a necessary condition and 

6 foreseeable that a person would do such a thing, that's 

7 sufficient? 

8  GENERAL MUKASEY: No, Your Honor, we would 

9 not. Because there are cases in which it may become 

necessary to prosecute somebody -- for example, where we 

11 have a situation in which we can charge another crime, 

12 but the charge of that crime would involve disclosure of 

13 classified information; it would disclose methods and 

14 sources -- we believe that it was Congress's choice to 

leave to the judgment of prosecutors the decision of 

16 what crimes the charge in conjunction with possession of 

17 explosives, and we think that's where the authority 

18 should remain. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is there in the 

statutes a difference between possession of explosives 

21 in this circumstance and possession of firearms? 

22  GENERAL MUKASEY: Possession of explosives 

23 inherently involves volatility. You asked for a policy 

24 explanation. Possession of explosives inherently 

involves a degree of volatility. Explosives cause 

10

1 indiscriminate and potentially vast harm. 

2  Firearms, for all the harm they cause, cause 

3 discriminate harm. And there's every reason for 

4 Congress to have treated explosives differently from the 

way it treated firearms. 

6  JUSTICE SOUTER: Was -- was the further 

7 explanation that what they were doing in amending the 

8 firearms statute was tailoring it more precisely to the 

9 possible felony by a police officer situation, and they 

simply did not face that possibility in the explosives 

11 statute? 

12  GENERAL MUKASEY: I think the history of the 

13 amendments to 924(c) reflects that. 

14  JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's a difference in 

16 two respects. One is 924(c) has the "in relationship" 

17 requirement, and it also has a shorter term. It's only 

18 -- in one it is five years, and the other is ten years. 

19 Is that right?

 GENERAL MUKASEY: Yes, that's correct, 

21 Justice Ginsburg; and that underlines, I think, the 

22 dangerousness, or Congress's perception of the 

23 dangerousness, and the volatility of explosives. And 

24 certainly -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any --­

1  GENERAL MUKASEY: -- this case bears that 

2 out. 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any policy 

4 limitation within the department not to charge under 

this provision unless there is a relationship between 

6 the underlying felony and the use of -- the carrying of 

7 explosives? 

8  GENERAL MUKASEY: There is no policy 

9 limitation that I'm aware of.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And you do have policy 

11 guidelines with money laundering. 

12  GENERAL MUKASEY: We do. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I suppose if you 

14 thought there was a problem, you could promulgate them 

out of your department. 

16  GENERAL MUKASEY: I think I'd be ideally 

17 suited to do that. 

18  (Laughter.) 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The ten years, 

though, is mandatory, correct? 

21  GENERAL MUKASEY: The ten years is 

22 mandatory. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if a prosecutor 

24 asks for it and there is an underlying felony and there 

is an explosive, that's an additional ten years, no

1 matter what. 

2  GENERAL MUKASEY: That's an additional ten 

3 years, no matter what. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you get -- the 

underlying felony is of the sort Justice Scalia was 

6 talking about, and let's say the person gets probation 

7 on that because, you know, it is the first offense, no 

8 harm, he still gets ten years. 

9  GENERAL MUKASEY: He still gets ten years. 

It is possible, again, to imagine many, many marginal 

11 situations; but I think Congress was willing to 

12 contemplate that because it wanted to make sure that it 

13 swept in the cases that had to be swept in. 

14  And to add a relational element would leave 

us unprotected against the cases that Congress wanted to 

16 include, and protected only against the marginal ones. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but how many 

18 cases are there likely to be -- this isn't one of them 

19 -- where you have no "in relation to" connection 

whatsoever? 

21  GENERAL MUKASEY: How many cases as a matter 

22 of common sense? 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or any historical 

24 record that you're familiar with.

 GENERAL MUKASEY: No historical record that

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 I'm familiar with, but I don't have complete knowledge 

2 of the historical record. 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, in this 

4 case, as you point out, there was, of course, a 

connection. And I would have thought in most cases 

6 where the prosecutor is interested in charging -­

7 because, as you have indicated, this case is -- there 

8 would be an actual connection. Now, you may have, as 

9 you suggest, problems with proof or -- or evidence; but, 

as a practical matter, I'm just wondering how often the 

11 question we're concerned about arises. 

12  GENERAL MUKASEY: I don't think -- I'm not 

13 aware of any other situation in which it has arisen. 

14 But I don't -- I think Congress didn't wanted to rule 

out anything when it wrote "any felony." 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: This isn't a very good 

17 case. If you wanted to bring a really absurd case, you 

18 could have picked a better one than this, because there 

19 really is something of a connection.

 GENERAL MUKASEY: I think -- I think the 

21 lessons we learned, particularly about the history, is 

22 that we don't want to bring absurd cases, and -- and we 

23 don't. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I mean the 

interesting thing is that you're -- the cases where this 

14

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 is going to arise is not where you're really worried 

2 about the explosives; it's going to -- because in that 

3 case, presumably there is going to be a relation, and 

4 you can use it as you used it in this case.

 The cases where this is going to be 

6 problematic is when you are really interested in the 

7 underlying felony. 

8  GENERAL MUKASEY: That -­

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, the guy 

who's driving in his car and calls his broker and is 

11 guilty of insider trading and has some firecrackers in 

12 the trunk, you're not worried about the firecrackers, 

13 but you want to crack down on the insider trading. 

14  GENERAL MUKASEY: That has to do more with 

the breadth of the definition of "explosives" than it 

16 has to do with the question of a relationship, because 

17 we may very well be concerned with the person who is 

18 committing what sounds like an innocuous felony but 

19 carrying a load of explosives in his trunk. So 

weaving in a relational requirement isn't going to solve 

21 the problem that's posed in what I think is Your Honor's 

22 hypothetical, which is the fact that firecrackers are as 

23 much explosives as bombs under the "explosives" 

24 definition contained in the statute.

 If there are no further questions, I'd like,

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS W. HILLIER, II 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

8  MR. HILLIER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court:

 General Mukasey put his finger on the point 

11 here when he said we wanted to charge a lead-pipe cinch 

12 case. But in doing so, what we now have is what was a 

13 terrorism prosecution and a choice to link the 

14 underlying felony -- or to link the carrying explosives 

charges exclusively to count 5 of the indictment, which 

16 charged a false statement, an argument which requests 

17 that this Court apply this statute to all sorts of 

18 situations theoretically that might even involve 

19 explosives that were lawfully carried during a 

completely unrelated felony. And I would disagree that 

21 that's what Congress thought, that's what Congress 

22 thought when it was creating this statute. 

23  The words -- in applying this Court's 

24 statutory construction regime, what we do first of all, 

of course, is look to the words of the text to see if it 

16

1 means what the government suggests it does in this case. 

2 And as, Chief Justice Roberts, you have already 

3 indicated, the word "during" has meanings beyond just 

4 that in 401 used here. But also other words in the text 

have significance to describing what the meaning of this 

6 particular statute is, and important among those are the 

7 terms "in which," which is found in the concluding 

8 sentence of the statute. And, of course, that's -- the 

9 companion word, the largest word in this particular 

statute, "explosives," and its very broad definition 

11 under 844(j). 

12  Taking first the term "in which," which is 

13 at the conclusion of 844(h) -- and I'll quote. And what 

14 it says is that the penalty that's going to attach to 

this prosecution shall run consecutively to, quote, "the 

16 felony in which the explosive was used or carried." 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying it should 

18 have said "during which"? 

19  MR. HILLIER: Well, I -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: "During the commission of 

21 which the explosive was used or carried"? 

22  MR. HILLIER: I just think that the words -­

23 the words that were used, Your Honor, establish the 

24 notion of a relationship between the felony and the 

explosive. The word "in" is, as this Court indicated in

3 "with respect to." 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but just -­

just as "during" has more than temporal -- can have more 

6 than temporal significance, I think "in" can have 

7 temporal significance. 

8  MR. HILLIER: It does, Your Honor. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We write "in the 

holiday season." 

11  MR. HILLIER: That's very true. And it 

12 fact, it has a, quote, "locational" sort of significance 

13 also. But as noted in Dunn, its primary definition, its 

14 first definition, is this relational one. And, while it 

might have -­

17 haven't looked at the dictionary -- but "during's" first

19 temporal.

 MR. HILLIER: It's temporal. That's 

21 correct. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: Could you give an example of 

23 where it's not temporal, an example of use of "during" 

24 that is not temporal?

 MR. HILLIER: I think the example posed by

1 the Chief Justice to General Mukasey is an example of

3  JUSTICE ALITO: But hanging up lights 

4 "during" the -- the holiday season doesn't -- that's not 

a temporal relationship?
 

6  MR. HILLIER: It's a -- it is a temporal
 

7 relationship, but it's a relationship between the act
 

8 that's occurring also, that's the underlying act.
 

9  But to get to the point of the -- Chief
 

Justice Robert's question, the fact that the word may 

11 have more than one meaning, particularly in this case, 

12 does not exclude the fact that the meaning of "in which" 

13 includes a relationship. And the most naturally 

14 suggested reading of these words in this case, "in 

which" and "explosives" together, is that there is a 

16 relationship, but there is -­

17  JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Hillier, I -- you know, 

18 I will accept maybe more than just for the sake of 

19 argument that if you stick to the text alone you've got 

an argument here for some uncertainty, for some 

21 ambiguity. 

22  The trouble that I have with your argument 

23 is that we're here to consider not only text but 

24 statutory history, And the statutory history seems to me 

pretty tough for you to get over. The statute was

4 carrying a gun that specified "in relation to." And it 

seems to me that the most reasonable inference to draw 

6 from that statutory history is that when Congress 

7 amended and technically re-enacted the statute, when it 

8 dropped "unlawfully," that it did not want "during" to 

9 be read, as it was in the handgun statute, "in relation 

to." 

11  And I -- that's seems to me the tough point 

12 of the argument. What is your response to that? 

13  MR. HILLIER: Yes, Your Honor. Two points: 

14 First, the idea -- the idea of in pari materia, which 

would suggest that what's happening in 924(c) ought to 

16 be occurring in 844 is -- has not the force that it 

17 would if we were talking about amendments to and 

18 constructions of the same statute, but rather what we 

19 have here are two statutes that are being interpreted by 

two legislators at different times to achieve different 

21 objects. And there's no reason to believe that the -­

22 well, the force of that -­

23  JUSTICE SOUTER: The different object -- I 

24 mean, the trouble with the different object argument is, 

as the Attorney General said, there was an evident

1 concern in amending the handgun statute not to sweep in 

2 the rogue police officer who happens to have a gun on 

3 him when he does something that in fact is unlawful. 

4  MR. HILLIER: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The negative inference from 

6 that is that there was an intent in the cognate 

7 explosives statute to sweep in people, whether in fact 

8 it was in relation to or not in relation to. 

9  MR. HILLIER: Your Honor, I think that -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Including the policeman who 

11 had cartridges in his gun, presumably, right? 

12  MR. HILLIER: Well, Your Honor, I think 

13 the -- when you're looking at what happened to 844, when 

14 "unlawfully" was taken out the words "in which" were 

added, which I think indicates that Congress had an 

16 appreciation of the relationship that's involved in that 

17 statute. While the legislative history doesn't say why 

18 "unlawfully" was taken out, it seems reasonable to 

19 believe that what they were trying to do was conform the 

statute to the purpose of -- its purpose. And its 

21 purpose did include, when you look at the "explosives" 

22 definition, the use of lawful explosives to further 

23 crimes. 

24  So if somebody has a can of gasoline and 

they want to use that to threaten somebody and create a

1 Federal crime or to accomplish a Federal crime, before 

2 that amendment occurred that -- that would have been a 

3 lawful possession of the explosives, so 844(h)(2) would 

4 not apply.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, fair enough so far as 

6 the argument goes. But that still leaves Congress 

7 taking the -- sort of making it as difficult as possible 

8 for you to take the position that you're taking, rather 

9 than as easy as possible.

 Why didn't it put in "in relation to"? 

11  MR. HILLIER: Well, the -- I think we go to 

12 yet another statutory construction tool, or at least 

13 observation by this Court that said the Congress can use 

14 different words in different statutes to accomplish the 

same thing. 

16  JUSTICE SOUTER: It can do it, but why would 

17 it have done so? You've the -- you've got the gun 

18 example sitting there. And why would it not have done 

19 so if, in fact -- so obvious a thing to do if that's 

what -- if it intended to come out your way? 

21  MR. HILLIER: Well, Your Honor, we don't 

22 know it didn't do that because the legislative history 

23 doesn't inform us. But to draw an analogy from your 

24 question with respect to changes done in these two exact 

statutes, as you read from the government's reply brief,

1 it is trying to establish through the words "during the 

2 commission of" the fact that it is the defendant that 

3 committed that crime, in other words it was he that did 

4 so. And we don't take any issue with that; in fact, it 

makes complete sense. 

6  But it's interesting to note that 924(c) in 

7 1971 was amended to put these -- to substitute the words 

8 "for which he may be prosecuted" instead of "which may 

9 be prosecuted." So one might ask why didn't they put 

the word "he" into 844 at the same time if there was any 

11 question about who the perpetrator of the crime was. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And maybe they said -­

13 maybe because they're trying to draft legislation 

14 without using pronouns.

 (Laughter.) 

16  MR. HILLIER: Touché, Your Honor. Yes. 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I take it that one of the 

18 reasons you make your argument is so that if you prevail 

19 and you go back to trial, you would argue that this is 

not in relation to? Is that correct? 

21  MR. HILLIER: Your Honor, perhaps I didn't

4 that the government can't show that it's in relation to.

 MR. HILLIER: Well, Your Honor, if you agree 

6 that there's a -- if you agree with the Ninth Circuit in 

7 this case, then the case is over. 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's right. 

9  MR. HILLIER: The government -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Why should we agree with

1  MR. HILLIER: Your Honor, if we can look at 

2 the facts of this case, I would respectfully disagree. 

3 What was done here was a charging decision which made 

4 that task impossible. The government could have simply 

charged this count with count 1, and we wouldn't be here 

6 today because surely the explosives were carried for the 

7 purpose of accomplishing the act of terrorism that was 

8 charged count 1. 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if there's an "in 

relationship" requirement, why would it be necessary for 

11 the explosives to facilitate the false statement? Why 

12 wouldn't it be sufficient if the false statement 

13 facilitated the unlawful use of the explosives? 

14  MR. HILLIER: We have a reverse sort of 

relationship. 

16  Your Honor, two answers to that: First, it 

17 would be at odds with the structure of the statute. If 

18 you look at the whole of 844(h), you see in (h)(1), the 

19 crime of using an explosive to -- an explosive to commit 

an underlying felony. And that is that sort of direct 

21 relationship that is carried forward in the language of 

22 (h)(2). 

23  But, secondly, that language -- that sort of 

24 relationship has been interpreted by this Court in Smith 

as acknowledged by the government in its briefing to

1 mean the relationship that we're talking about. 

2  JUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly what's 

3 bothering me. The issue in this case doesn't seem to me 

4 to be these weird hypotheticals. Of course it requires 

a relationship, in my mind. 

6  But I don't see why the relationship 

7 couldn't be exactly the one Justice Alito was talking 

8 about. I mean, imagine a person has a packed car filled 

9 with explosives. He's going to blow something up. A 

policemen comes up; he shoots the policeman. The reason 

11 he shot the policeman was because he had his car packed 

12 with explosives. 

13  And if this -- if this provision -- I mean, 

14 I can't understand why this provision wouldn't be aimed 

directly at that kind of thing. 

16  MR. HILLIER: Your Honor, I can't say too 

17 much more than what I have. When you look at the 

18 statute -­

19  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Suppose I don't 

agree with you about that -­

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: You could say it is not a 

22 question on which we grant certiorari.

1 know -- but you could say that. You could say that.
 

2 But the problem is I have to answer the question -- I
 

3 have to reach an answer that I believe should be
 

4 sensible.


 MR. HILLIER: Yes, sir. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: So what should I do -­

7  MR. HILLIER: Well, Your Honor -­

8  JUSTICE BREYER: -- if I think that shooting 

9 the policeman because he's going to catch the criminal 

filled with explosives is within this statute? And 

11 similarly, lying to a customs officer so he won't catch 

12 me when my car is filled with explosives is within the 

13 statute? 

14  Suppose I believe that, but I also think the 

statute is not meant to govern those odd hypotheticals 

16 that you come up with? There has to be a relationship, 

17 but the one I described falls within the word 

18 "relationship." 

19  Now what do I do?

 MR. HILLIER: Well, Your Honor, the 

21 relationship -- if you look at the structure of the 

22 statute, surely (h)(1) does not describe that sort of 

23 relationship; (h)(2) is the next statute or the next 

24 subsection of that statute, and its purpose is simply to 

capture the same criminal objective here, that is to

1 say, the marriage of explosives and a felony. 

2  JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that argument. 

3 But suppose I don't accept the argument? Then what do I 

4 do in this case? That's what I'm asking.

 MR. HILLIER: I would ask the Court -- well, 

6 I would think the Court would draw some -- an answer 

7 from Smith which did describe a relationship contrary to 

8 the way Your Honor is doing with respect to this case 

9 that goes back to -- goes -- wasn't instructed that way; 

and so it can't be -- this case still has to go back. 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think on this 

12 evidence, on this record, that a jury, if it were 

13 instructed to -- that it had to find "in relation to" 

14 could return a conviction of guilty including the "in 

relation to"? 

16  MR. HILLIER: If this case had been 

17 instructed correctly? 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: If this case had been 

19 instructed according to your theory of the statute and 

on this record and on this evidence, could a jury find 

21 your client guilty? 

22  MR. HILLIER: No, Your Honor.

24 attorney general says he needs it.

1  MR. HILLIER: Beg your pardon, Your Honor? 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I ask you about the 

3 "in which," the "in which" thing? It has just occurred 

4 to me that "in which" is in a very sloppy clause anyway, 

because it says "shall run concurrently with any other 

6 term of imprisonment, including that imposed for the 

7 felony in which the explosive was used or carried." 

8  What about the fire? It omits fire entirely 

9 -- in which fire or the explosive. Fire or the 

explosive was used or the explosive was carried. It's a 

11 pretty sloppy job down at the end of (h), isn't it? 

12  So I wouldn't put a whole lot of weight on 

13 the "in which" given that the rest of it is so sloppy. 

14  MR. HILLIER: Well, Your Honor, the "in 

which" -- the point obviously was that it strengthens 

16 and informs the relationship here to be more than the 

17 coincidental or temporal one the government -­

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: If you are being very 

19 precise, but whoever wrote that was, obviously, not 

being very precise because he left out "fire" entirely. 

21  MR. HILLIER: I suppose that goes to the 

22 idea that we shouldn't draw a lot of information from 

23 the amendments that were occurring on 924 when they 

24 weren't even looking at this statute and considering it 

and its consequences to the changes in 844 -- or having

1 effect in 844. 

2  Your Honor, I would just simply conclude by 

3 indicating that the terms, which I think we agree, 

4 naturally suggest that there must be a relationship, and 

the breadth of the term "explosives" includes a lot of 

6 lawful items that can be carried, if they were carried 

7 in a felony, must be related to that felony if you're 

8 going to have 844's effect and its purpose, because when 

9 you look at the purpose of the act and the way that they 

constructed it so carefully and thoughtfully in terms of 

11 the crimes that were -- or the -- the use of explosives, 

12 it applies only to that portion of the statute that 

13 involves illegal use of criminal -- of explosives. And 

14 the combination of all of these elements certainly gives 

force to our argument and tends to rub -- tends to do 

16 the opposite to the government. 

17  At the end of the day, if there's anything 

18 to be said for the government's argument, then there is 

19 an ambiguity, and it should be construed in favor of the 

defendant. 

21  And I -- just a concluding point to answer 

22 Justice Kennedy's questions, the government could have 

23 avoided all of this by simply charging this case, as it 

24 should have, by linking count 9 with count 1, where the 

proof problem wouldn't have been a -- the only

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend 

6 indicated that this issue doesn't come up very often as 

7 a practical matter.  Do you disagree with that? 

8  MR. HILLIER: Well, Your Honor -- no, I 

9 don't disagree with that, and I'm not sure why that is. 

But I think it's been alluded to by the Court already in 

11 its questioning. It could be that prosecutors simply 

12 recognized this to be a good plea bargaining chip and 

13 maybe the other prosecutors understand that there's a 

14 relationship required.

 GENERAL MUKASEY: I just wanted to make two 

21 brief points on rebuttal. First, Justice Breyer's 

22 question and position appears to read in a relational

anybody, by Congress.

1  And secondly, that the Respondent's 

2 reference to gasoline as an explosive I think is a bit 

3 of -- is a bit of a reach. I don't think gasoline is 

4 generally regarded as an explosive unless it is prepared 

and processed and presented in a certain way with -- in 

6 ways that are not present simply by carrying a can of 

7 gasoline to help a -- to help out a friend who's run out 

8 of gas. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: And maybe gunpowder doesn't 

include the little bit that's in a cartridge either. 

11 You think it does? 

12  GENERAL MUKASEY: I think it does. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, could I ask 

14 you, do you have an answer to your friend's point about 

the "in which" language? 

16  GENERAL MUKASEY: The "in which" simply 

17 includes both, number one, the use -- the actual use 

18 and, number two, the carrying. 

19  I agree that it's not a model of elegant 

construction, but "in which" does include the two, both 

21 the actual use and the mere carrying. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understood his 

23 point to be that it's surprising that they refer to use 

24 of the explosives or carrying of the explosives with 

reference to the underlying felony, "in which" the -­

1 suggests that the explosive was used or carried with 

2 respect to the underlying felony. 

3  And I understood your position to be that it 

4 doesn't have to be.

 GENERAL MUKASEY: No, I think it suggests 

6 simply that the underlying felony was, in fact, 

7 committed. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it was going to be -­

9 it was going to be inaccurate as to one or the other of 

one or two. If you said "during," that would be -- that 

11 would be inaccurate as to one. 

12  And "in" is accurate as to one but 

13 inaccurate as to two. I guess they should have said "in 

14 or during" or "in which."

 They should have added "fire," too, right?
