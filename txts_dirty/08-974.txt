(11:05 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear argument 

next in Case 08-974, Lewis v. The City of Chicago. 

Mr. Payton. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN A. PAYTON 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. PAYTON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

On 11 separate occasions, Chicago used an 

unlawful cutoff score to determine which applicants it 

would hire as firefighters. There’s no dispute that 

the cutoff score had an adverse impact on qualified 

black applicants and was not job-related. 

The only question presented is whether each 

use of the cutoff score in each of the hiring rounds was 

a separate violation of Title VII. An affirmative 

answer to that question is both the best reading of the 

statute and the soundest policy. 

Section 703(k) of Title VII provides that in 

a disparate impact case, as this case, an unlawful 

employment practice is established -- those are the 

words -- "is established" when, quote, "a respondent 

uses an employment practice that causes disparate impact

on the basis of race," close quote. 

Section 703(h) states that, quote, "a test, 

its application, and action upon the results," close 

quote, are each violations of Title VII if they are, 

quote, "used to discriminate," close quote. 

Section 703(a)(2) prohibits racially 

discriminatory classifications. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So under your 

position, say the City adopts a discriminatory -- takes 

a -- issues a discriminatory test; people take it; they 

come out with the results; the City says these -- this 

is the test we’re going to use, but, you know, we don't 

have any vacancies. Nobody can sue at that point. 

MR. PAYTON: No, no. Our position is that 

in fact there was an additional violation when the 

classification occurred when the City announced what it 

intended to do in the future. That’s also a violation. 

But if I can make the contrast, 

Mr. Chief Justice, when the City -- suppose they didn't 

announce anything at all, and what they did was in all 

those occasions, the 11 I just described -- they used the 

unlawful cutoff score and made hiring decisions. 

Title VII's disparate impact looks at the 

consequences of decisions like that. And those 

consequences, the results of that clearly occur in the

future on those 11 hiring occasions, and then we would 

clearly have a cause of action on each of those 11 times. 

Now, I'll come back and say that Chicago 

announces, before it does any of that, that it intends to 

do that in the future. That announcement is an 

independent violation, but that announcement does not 

change the impact and the consequences that in fact 

still would happen in the future when they happen. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: There’s an independent 

violation without an impact? I mean, it's not the 

impact provision that you quoted which makes that a 

violation. It must be some other provision that makes 

it a violation. What other provision is it? 

MR. PAYTON: Well, there is an impact. You 

mean when the announcement is made? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. PAYTON: When the announcement is 

made -- let me make two points: First of all, I believe 

we -- you could clearly seek to enjoin Chicago from 

doing something unlawful in the future --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. 

MR. PAYTON: -- as you clearly have a cause 

of action at the announcement. We know that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that’s because of 

an impending violation.

MR. PAYTON: Because an impending violation --

JUTICE SCALIA: But you say -- you say it is 

an actual violation. 

MR. PAYTON: Yes. And the question whether 

or not the announcement itself is in violation of the 

statute, I believe section 703(a)(2) and, actually, all 

three provisions, make it unlawful to actually have a 

classification that has the effects I just said, and 

the effects would simply be in how they were sorting 

the results. 

So I think there is an impact. It's not the 

same impact that ripples through time. And the reason I 

said, if they had not made an announcement it’s clear 

there are consequences that happen in the future each of 

those 11 times, there’s an additional violation when 

they actually use the announcement to say what they 

intend to do. They say what they intend to do, and then 

they do it. Those are two different violations. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the language of 

the statute of 703 is to "limit, segregate, or 

classify." 

MR. PAYTON: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is it your position 

that the violation occurs at the classification that’s 

announced and that every subsequent hiring has limited

someone's opportunity so that they -- there’s a 

violation subsequently under the limit clause as opposed 

to the classification clause, or it's each event is a 

classification violation? 

MR. PAYTON: It's our position that, in 

fact, all three of the sections I quoted from are 

implicated in the actions that Chicago took. 

Clearly, there’s a classification, but when 

they actually exclude from actual consideration for any 

of the jobs on the 11 occasions, that's a limitation. 

It's clearly a limitation. When they use the test 

results, that's an action upon the test results. When 

they use that to make decisions, that's clearly a 

violation of (k). 

All three provisions are in fact implicated, 

sometimes in similar ways, sometimes in different ways. 

All of them have consequences. 

And the way disparate impact law works is, 

you have an employment practice -- it's always facially 

neutral -- that has an adverse impact on the basis of 

race that causes there to be a disparate impact and 

consequences. We look at consequences, and the elements 

of the disparate impact violation are not complete until 

we have all of those elements. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Your position may -- may follow

from the language of Title VII, but you began by saying 

that it also represents the best policy. And I wonder 

if you could explain why that is so. 

Here, the City of Chicago continued to use 

this test for quite a number of years after it was 

administered. And so as you interpret the statute, I 

gather that someone could still file a disparate impact 

claim 6 or 7 years after the test was first administered, 

and quite a few years after it was first used in making 

a hiring decision. And how can that be squared with 

Congress's evident desire in Title VII to require that an 

EEOC charge be filed rather promptly after the employment 

action is taken? 

MR. PAYTON: I think the answer is that this 

is completely consistent with how the statute works, but 

I'm going to address the policy concern as well. But 

how the statute works is, there’s a violation every 

time there’s a use. 

If we looked at disparate treatment, there’s 

a violation every time there’s an intention to 

discriminate. If there was a future intention to 

discriminate, there would be a new violation. So if 

there is a next use, there’s a next violation. And 

that's how that ought to work. 

But look at how this worked. Chicago used

an unlawful cutoff score on those 11 occasions to make 

decisions. Chicago should have stopped using the 

discriminatory cutoff score, and it should have looked at 

all of the qualified applicants that it had judged 

qualified in making its decisions. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If it -- if it stopped using 

it, it might be vulnerable to a Rizzo-type suit from the 

people who were benefiting. 

MR. PAYTON: I actually think that that 

conflict is not present. Chicago can always make a 

decision that responds to something that was unlawful. 

And I think this Court has always made it clear the 

standard may be in Ricci, but the law is clearly that if 

Chicago has reason to believe -- very good reason to 

believe that it is doing something that is unlawful, it 

can stop doing something unlawful. That’s especially 

the case here. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought in Ricci that 

was New Haven's position, that they thought that the 

test was unlawful because of the disparate impact. 

MR. PAYTON: I understand. The standard 

that may apply to Chicago's decision may be different, 

but let me give you the example in this case. 

Chicago used a cutoff score that the 

district court finds and that their expert who designed

the test told them was problematic, to make decisions 

that has nothing job-related about it at all. It's 

arbitrary. The group that are qualified are as 

qualified as the group that are well qualified and 

vice versa. They had available to them the option of 

picking randomly from that group, both groups combined, 

and making the decisions on a random draw. That is, in 

fact, how they made all of the decisions inside of the 

groups that they used. That’s always available. 

Chicago could have done that at any time. 

The policy point here, Justice Alito, is 

that -- I'd say the animating purpose behind Title VII is, 

as this Court has said, the eradication of 

discrimination from our workplace. And you want it to 

be eradicated. Chicago should not have continued doing 

this. And the law ought to say, and I think it does 

say, that when they use something that is unlawful, they 

can be challenged every time they use something that is 

unlawful. If the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How long does the City's 

exposure persist? Let's say that the -- in the tenth 

round, someone is selected for the job from the 

qualified group. And then there's a cutback, and there 

are going to be layoffs. So the last hired is the first 

fired. Could -- would there be a Title VII suit when

that last hired is laid off, on the ground that if 

Chicago had done what it was supposed to do, this person 

would have had the job long ago and would be higher up 

on the seniority list? 

MR. PAYTON: Let me give you two responses 

to that. 

The first answer is that the statute of 

limitations is 300 days after every use, and it's no 

longer. So for whatever it is, if you violate 

Title VII, the statute of limitations is 300 days. If 

there is a use that goes into the future, it's 300 days 

after the last use. Right now, Chicago has stopped 

using that. The doors are closed. No one else can 

challenge this. 

To your specific question about how would it 

work if there was a layoff arrangement, the proposed --

the remedy order in this case -- it's not in effect 

because we are where we are -- but the remedy order in 

this case includes shutting down the use of this, but it 

also has provisions for seniority to in fact address, I 

believe, exactly the circumstances you just described, 

Justice Ginsburg. So I believe that is contemplated and 

handled in the remedial order. 

The issue about the policy here, though, is 

that if you don't say that a use, in fact, can be

challenged, a use of something unlawful can be 

challenged, what you could end up with here is that 

Chicago would then take the message that it's okay once 

they are past the first 300 days, and they could just go 

on using the discriminatory cutoff score over and over 

and over again, and that is inconsistent with the 

overall policy of what Title VII is trying to root out 

of our economy and in our workplace. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Payton, can I ask this 

general question? Am I correct that each firefighter in 

the qualified group who did not make the well-qualified 

has a cause of action as though he had been refused 

employment when anyone else is hired? There were 11 

people hired, as I understand. Did each one of those 

hirings give everybody else in the class a cause of 

action? 

MR. PAYTON: The group of the black 

qualified applicants that are in the qualified category, 

but the qualified category is qualified as the other 

category -- every time the city made decisions about 

filling jobs in the fire department, it excluded every 

single one of those applicants, even though they were 

qualified. So every single one was excluded. 

So they all have a cause of action because 

they were excluded and that clearly fits very easily

within how --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But surely they couldn't 

all recover, because there was only one job available. 

MR. PAYTON: No. That's correct. That's about 

what the remedy would be. So the remedy and -- you know, 

obviously wouldn't be to give all of them jobs. That's 

not the remedy, and that wasn’t the remedy that's 

sought -- was sought here. But they were all excluded 

from consideration, and that's a violation of Title VII's 

disparate impact prohibition. So they all have a cause 

of action. 

The way the remedy would work --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What is -- what is the 

remedy other than saying change your practice? What is 

-- say one person sues and asks for damages, what 

would the remedy be for a single applicant who was not 

hired at the time somebody else was hired? 

MR. PAYTON: It may be very little. So if 

it's a single applicant who sues and not a class -- this 

is a class. So if a single applicant sues, the remedy 

would be to stop using the unlawful cutoff score, okay, 

and then to figure out what would have happened if that 

unlawful cutoff score hadn't have occurred, and that 

would have created a very miniscule chance of ever 

becoming a firefighter and perhaps turning that into

some sort of damage award, but it would be miniscule. 

In the actual event, the award includes some 

actual jobs being allocated to the 6,000 members of the 

class -- it was 132 -- to be decided upon in some random 

way that they would be hired. But that's how it would 

work. But they are all clearly injured when they are 

all excluded from consideration in all 11 rounds, in 

violation of Title VII. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that -- each --

each qualified firefighter who did not get a job because 

the well-qualified one did has a new cause of action, I 

guess, every time somebody is hired from the -- the 

well-qualified pool? 

MR. PAYTON: Every time --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, 

somebody is hired, that constitutes discrimination 

against the qualified black firefighter who was not 

hired, and then another -- then somebody else is 

hired -- each time it's a new cause of action? 

MR. PAYTON: They had 11 rounds of hiring --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 

MR. PAYTON: -- that are relevant to this case. 

There are other rounds afterwards. They exhaust the first 

category. But in the 11 rounds of hiring, when in every one 

of those rounds the unlawful cutoff score is used, that is

action upon the results. That is a limitation. You know, 

that is the use of something that causes an adverse impact 

on the basis of race -- and, yes --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, so they would 

have a new cause of action, sure. 

MR. PAYTON: That’s a cause of action. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, but they -- but 

if 300 days go from the first round of hiring, they 

don't -- they cannot sort of piggyback that onto a later 

cause of action. 

MR. PAYTON: Yes, if they sue -- in this 

case, the EEOC charge was filed after the second round 

of hiring, and in this case then, therefore, no remedy 

can take account of the first round of hiring. If they 

had sued only on the seventh round of hiring, no remedy 

could take account of those forgone opportunities. So, 

that would also play out in how the remedial order would 

work. 

And I think I want to reserve the rest of my 

time. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

MR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

As the questions I think reveal, I think the 

bottom line question in this case is whether or not 

under the text of Title VII there was a present 

violation in each of the 11 rounds of hiring when the 

City of Chicago relied on its concededly discriminatory 

test to exclude the plaintiffs from consideration. And 

we think that Title VII has three mutually reinforcing 

provisions in it, each of which point to the same 

conclusion. 

A violation of Title VII occurred in this 

case when Chicago, in each of those 11 rounds, used its 

hiring practice with -- and caused a disparate impact, 

thereby limiting the employment opportunities of certain 

applicants. Chicago gave an ability test and relied on 

that ability test in a way that Title VII forbids. It 

took action upon the results of that discriminatory test 

in a way that arbitrarily excluded qualified applicants 

from being hired. 

Justice Alito, I think -- in response to your 

question, I think our position follows entirely from the 

text of the statute. We’re not as concerned about the 

policy consequences, though we do think that if the 

Court were concerned about the policy consequences, we

think that there’s a good reason why Congress 

distinguished between disparate treatment and disparate 

impact litigation. But it's the language of Title VII 

itself, and in particular 703(h), which forbids action 

upon the results. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Why would Congress have 

wanted to allow a question like this to be left open for 

such an extended period of time? Why would it not have 

wanted everybody who is potentially affected by it to 

understand where things stand at a much earlier point, 

at some reasonable period of time after all of the 

information is in the -- in the possession of a 

potential plaintiff to determine whether there has been 

a disparate impact and whether that -- that person is 

going to be adversely affected by it, particularly if at 

a later point the effect of a remedial decree can be to 

upset the employment -- the employment status of other 

people who have been hired in the interim? 

MR. KATYAL: I agree that there -- there 

might be policy arguments against it as well as for it, 

but here's the way I think we look at it -- and the 

United States is the nation's largest employer, and we 

face similar concerns. We give certain tests. 

But I think what might have been -- what was 

probably animating Congress was a fear that if the

rule of the City of Chicago were adopted, then an 

employer who made it 300 days without an EEOC charge 

being filed, 300 days after the announcement of the test 

results, would then be able to for all time use that 

discriminatory test, and it would lock in that period, 

that test, for as long as 10, 20 years, and Congress 

could have legitimately worried about if a test made it 

300 days, an employer essentially had a get-out-of-jail-

free card to use for all time. And I would say that 

that precise thing appears to have happened in this very 

case. 

At Joint Appendix page 54, when the City 

announced its test results in January of 1996, 

it said it intended to use this test for only 3 

years through 1999. Afterwards, 1999 came, the City, in 

the City's own briefs -- this is the court of appeals 

brief at page 12 -- they admit they made a new decision 

to continue using this test and the test results for 

subsequent hiring rounds. That was a new decision, and 

indeed that's a decision, I think, many employers would 

logically make after 3 years, because then they 

don't have to worry about the possibility of a disparate 

impact lawsuit. 

And since, as this Court said in Ricci, one 

of the goals of Title VII is really to encourage

voluntary compliance on the part of employers, adopting 

a rule like the City of Chicago's is really antithetical 

to that, because then it will essentially lock in for 

all time that old discriminatory test. 

I think another reason policy -- another 

policy reason Congress may have thought about is that a 

rule that forced people to file within 300 days might be 

damaging to the EEOC and divisive to employers, because 

it would say you only have that 300-day period to file, 

even before all the consequences of the -- of the -- of 

the employment decision are fully understood. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, actually in -- in 

this case, am I correct that -- that 9 years has gone by, 

but that's because of the litigation? The suit was filed, 

what, 4 months after the 300-day period ran? 

MR. KATYAL: The first charge was filed, I 

believe, 420 days after the January 26th announcement of 

the test results. And, yes, Justice Kennedy, then there 

was a period of discovery and litigation over business 

necessity and the like. 

And in this case, the City admitted in other 

litigation that there was no basis for giving this 89 

cutoff score, that a person who scored 65 was just as 

likely to succeed as a firefighter as a person who 

was -- who had scored 89.

Justice Stevens, you had asked about the 

remedy in the case, and here's how we understand the way 

remedies work in disparate impact litigation: It's 

largely injunctive in nature. It's mostly about 

preventing future problems. 

There is a back pay claim that is available 

that is statutorily capped at 2 years. Not everyone in 

this 6,000-person class could get that full amount of 

back pay obviously. Instead, what happened here, there 

was a remedial phase at trial, and what they did was they 

decided that -- the experts on both sides admitted that 

132 people, approximately, would have been hired out of 

that class, and that provided the appropriate amount of 

back pay. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you get --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was it -- was it 132 named 

people or was it just 132 undifferentiated? 

MR. KATYAL: I think it was 132 

undifferentiated people, and then I think there --

and Mr. Payton can, I think, fully explain how the 

randomization of awards was allocated. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So everybody gets 

132 over 6,000 times whatever the number of people who 

would have been hired? 

MR. KATYAL: Right. And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean the pay for 

the number of people. 

MR. KATYAL: Right. And, Mr. Chief Justice, 

to respond to your concern before, that amount of money 

is not -- you couldn't go back and look to earlier 

periods of time outside of the statute of limitations, 

outside of the 300-day period, rather only any 

subsequent use. For example, in this case the remedy 

couldn't look to the first round of hiring because no 

lawsuit was brought within that first round of hiring. 

It was brought at the -- it was brought after the second 

round of hiring. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think you had a 

footnote in your reply brief that said that if your 

position prevails there would need to be an adjustment 

in the relief granted by the district court --

MR. KATYAL: That is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- wasn’t it? 

MR. KAYTAL: That is correct. And I think 

that the Petitioners agree with that as well. And 

that's I think a further limit on the way in which this 

present violation theory operates as a matter of 

practice. Now, this Court has said in cases such as 

Ledbetter that -- that there must be a present 

violation, and disparate impact litigation looks quite

different than disparate treatment litigation in 

practice, because disparate impact litigation doesn't 

need that missing element that has been at issue in 

Ledbetter and Evans and Ricks, of discriminatory intent 

at that subsequent time of action. 

Here, in a disparate impact case, all that 

need be shown by the plaintiff is adverse impact, and 

that adverse impact happens in each of those 11 rounds 

of hiring. Each of the time -- each time the City used 

its test results and drew a line and said, you under 89, 

we are not looking at you, that was action upon the 

results, to use the language of (h)(2). 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that would be clear 

even though it had not been established much earlier 

that the test was invalid. So a city could go along 

using a test that was an invalid test, not declared 

such; 10 years later, somebody comes up and says: This 

test that is being applied to me is an invalid test. 

MR. KATYAL: That's exactly correct, Justice 

Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- of what use is a 

statute of limitations that -- that -- that operates 

that way? 

MR. KATYAL: Let me say two things: First 

is I think (h)(2) refers to "action upon the results,"

and that thing happened in 10 years is itself action 

upon the results, and so I think as a statutory matter 

the language decides it. 

Now, with respect to the policy reason, I 

think the reason is that otherwise Congress had to fear 

precisely what you’re saying, that an employer 10 

years from now would use that discriminatory test, 

because they knew they had made it past the 300-day 

initial phase of time, and then could use it for all 

time. And so the statute of limitations and the 

concerns about repose work hand in hand with other 

concerns of Title VII, and in particular incentivizing 

employers to ensure voluntary compliance with the law of 

Title VII, and which this Court said in Griggs, the goal 

of which is to eradicate discrimination from the United 

States' labor markets. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I suppose the 

benefit is not that the City knows it's safe -- it can 

rely on a test and all that -- but knows that it only has 

to pay 300 days back. 

MR. KATYAL: That is -- that is -- that is 

the benefit of that particular back pay limitation, yes. 

But in a case like this, where the City knows very well, 

this test is discriminatory and, indeed, has said so in 

litigation, I think Congress wanted to incentivize and

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENNA RUTH SOLOMON 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MS. SOLOMON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

In January 1996, the City adopted and 

announced an eligibility list for hiring candidates who 

sat for the firefighters' examination. Petitioners were 

told that a priority pool had been created, that based 

on their scores they were not classified in that pool, 

and that further consideration of candidates would be 

limited to those who were in the priority pool, at least 

until everyone in that pool had been called for 

processing. 

The City also publicly admitted that this 

tiered eligibility list had adverse impact on 

African-Americans, and Petitioners were aware of this. 

But Petitioners did not file charges challenging the 

exam and the cutoff score within 300 days after the 

tiered eligibility list was adopted and announced. 

Now they contend that charges can be filed

to challenge the same exam and the same cutoff score 

every time the City hired from the priority hiring pool. 

That position cannot be squared with the statute. 

Calling other applicants from a hiring pool from which 

Petitioners had already been excluded did not limit or 

classify Petitioners in any way. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose there were no 

list, but each time there was a hiring round the City 

just took from the top -- from the top score down. 

There’s no list, but each time the City uses the test 

results and hires the people with the top scores. 

MS. SOLOMON: If I understand correctly, 

that would be the same case as this, for this reason: 

A list is used in a couple of different ways. A list 

might be used to describe the strict rank ordering that 

Your Honor is describing, and in that case, once there 

is that kind of a list, it's the same as this case. 

What happened in this case after that kind 

of a list was made, we also drew another line, which was 

the priority hiring pool. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, my -- my hypothetical 

was there’s no list at all. 

MS. SOLOMON: If --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They just go back to the 

raw scores, and each time they picked the top people.

MS. SOLOMON: So that actually -- if we’re 

going back to the scores but no announcement has been 

made ever that we are going to use the scores in a 

certain way, we agree that every time the city actually 

consulted the scores, there would be a new claim. But 

that's because --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what is -- what is 

the list, other than an administratively convenient way 

to use the scores? 

MS. SOLOMON: The list was the device that 

limited and classified Petitioners in this case, and 

that's why it's so important. Because in order to have 

a present cause of action, section (a)(2) -- under 

section (a)(2), which is the disparate impact provision, 

Petitioners have to point to something in the charging 

period that actually limited and classified them. And 

that was the effect of the list, and including the 

priority hiring pool. 

In a case where there is no general 

practice, no announcement, no decision, nothing, but 

rather every time the City makes hiring, the City 

undertakes a new decision with new criteria, then it is 

making a decision at that point; it is engaging in a 

practice that is then at that time limiting and 

classifying the Petitioners. What happened --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So even though there is a 

clear case on the merits of disparate impact, unless the 

suit is commenced within 30 days of the announcement, 

then it's as though it were lawful. That's your 

position. 

MS. SOLOMON: The statute, (a)(2), requires 

an unlawful --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that -- is that --

there's a free pass. You don't sue within 30 days of the 

compilation of the list and the notice of the list; you sue 

420 days later. The discriminatory practice gets frozen, 

the status quo gets frozen forever. That's -- that is 

your position, is it not? 

MS. SOLOMON: That is the function of the 

operation of the statute of limitations, and of course 

it's not unique to Title VII. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is not exactly a 

title -- a statute of limitations. It's a time you have 

to file your charge. It's a charge filing. 

MS. SOLOMON: Correct. And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There’s also a 2-year 

statute of limitations in Title VII. You can't get back 

pay, I think, for more than 2 years. 

MS. SOLOMON: The 300-day charging period 

under Title VII functions like a statute of limitations,

and when a timely charge is not filed, no recovery can 

be had for that claim. And the Court has said that over 

and over in a series of disparate treatment cases. 

Now, the defining feature --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you don't have one 

case, I think, certainly not from this Court, of 

disparate impact. All the cases that you cite are 

disparate treatment cases. 

MS. SOLOMON: The cases are disparate 

treatment cases, Justice Ginsburg, but the rule should 

be the same in this case for several reasons: First, 

those cases reflect that the reason there is not 

a present violation when the consequences of a prior 

discriminatory act are felt is because the defining 

feature of the claim is absent within the charging 

period. 

Now, that is a perfectly good rule, no matter 

whether it's discriminatory treatment or discriminatory 

impact. And in this case, the defining feature, namely 

disparate impact in the sense defined by the statute, 

required by the statute, to limit or classify in a way 

that denies people employment opportunities based on 

race -- that defining feature was absent within the 

charging period. 

JUSTICE BREYER: How is it absent? Because

the statute says that the established -- the -- it's 

established -- namely, the unlawful employment practice 

-- it's established only if, and certainly if, the 

respondent uses --

MS. SOLOMON: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- a particular employment 

practice that has a disparate impact. That refers back 

to (a)(2). 

So back in that period, on a certain date, he 

used that limiting practice, and, therefore, on that 

particular date, he established the unlawful employment 

practice by using a test that limited, et cetera. 

MS. SOLOMON: I -- I have two responses, 

Justice Breyer, and the first is that section (k), which 

is what Your Honor is quoting from, does not describe 

accrual, and it does not define the underlying violation. 

It talks about when an -- excuse me, when a violation is 

established. And what's so interesting is that the 

reliance on those words "uses an employment practice" --

it’s a few words plucked out of the middle of section (k). 

You actually can't apply section (k) 

literally to this case and have anything that approaches 

anything that makes sense. And that's because section 

(k) actually goes on after those words that get 

highlighted over and over, and it’s -- and it refers to

the rest of what happens in a case when a claim of 

disparate impact is tried. 

And so if you --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why don't we look at 

subsection (h) --

MS. SOLOMON: Subsection --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that says -- and it's 

an -- "it shall be an unlawful employment practice for 

an employer to give and" -- conjunctive -- "and act 

upon the results." 

MS. SOLOMON: Correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So when you hire, aren't 

you acting upon the results? And how are you acting 

upon -- you may be acting upon it, as Petitioner argues, 

when you classify, but why aren't you acting upon when 

you hire? 

MS. SOLOMON: Because there is no act that 

limits and classifies. And what’s interesting about 

section (h), it's not --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I go back to 

Justice Breyer's point. Isn't it, in the very act of 

hiring, you are using the test results and saying --

each time you do it, you’re saying: I'm going to cut 

off at this limit, and I'm not going to consider someone 

outside of this limited tier.

missing in this case. The city did not go back to the 

test results, and it did not -- it did not create --

engage in a new decision or a new practice. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't that what 

"practice and policy" means? Meaning that each time, as 

you continue forward, you are using a particular 

practice, a particular policy? 

MS. SOLOMON: Petitioners continued to be 

ineligible for as long as the list was used in the way 

that we said at the outset it was going to be used; 

namely, that the well-qualified pool, the priority 

hiring pool, would be called first. 

The reason they continued to be ineligible 

is because they had been limited and classified as 

ineligible until the priority pool was hired first. 

That was the only practice that had adverse impact 

within -- as required by the statute, meaning limit and 

classify. 

Now, to complete my answer to 

Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question, 

Ms. Solomon? Would your argument be the same if the 

practice in this case were -- required a high school 

diploma?

JUSTICE STEVENS: Suppose the practice were 

a high school diploma. Could that -- would you make 

the same argument as you're making today? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And let's add to that, 

that it was adopted 10 years ago --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That’s right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and Duke Power 

announced to the world that it was going to use a high 

school diploma. Indeed, it listed in the county all of 

the high school graduates and said: This is the list. 

MS. SOLOMON: A case like that might present 

different accrual problems for this reason: There might 

be several appropriate times when a person affected by a 

policy like that could be said actually to have been 

limited and classified in their employment 

opportunities. And it could be when they enter grade 

school, but that is not an appropriate time, so if it's 

10 years before the act -- so that person is -- is 

roughly 8 years old. 

It could be when they apply to the employer. 

It could be a variety of other times. But those cases,

present, they are not presented here, because this was a 

closed universe. Everybody affected by the City's 

eligibility list and the test and the cutoff score knew 

from the moment --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but -- but in my 

example, everybody who is not a high school graduate 

would have been affected right away. 

MS. SOLOMON: But if they are not interested 

in employment with that employer, then they are not --

it -- you -- they are certainly affected in one sense of 

the word, but they’re perhaps -- it would not be possible 

to say their employment opportunities had been affected. 

We certainly agree that there should be one 

time to challenge every employment practice that has an 

unlawful disparate impact, but the question in this case 

is whether there is more than one to challenge exactly 

the same thing? Petitioners --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You force people to 

challenge the practice when they don't even know if it's 

going to affect them. In the hypothetical that has been 

discussed, somebody who didn't graduate from high 

school, you know, wants to be something other than a 

firefighter. But that doesn't work out, and then he says, 

well, now I want to be a firefighter. And they say,

suit earlier, no? 

MS. SOLOMON: Our position is that the 

charging period runs from the unlawful practice. And 

the Court has stressed it is important to confirm --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but what is 

the unlawful practice? 

MS. SOLOMON: The unlawful practice here was 

limiting and classifying Petitioners in a way that 

deprived them of their employment opportunities. This 

is what -- this -- what they were told --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we put that in 

concrete terms? It was the 89 percent cutoff, so that 

anybody who got below 89 percent on the test was never 

going to be considered until all the first people who 

got 89 to 98. 

MS. SOLOMON: Correct. And after that 

decision was made, there was nothing else that Chicago 

did that affected Petitioners in the terms required by 

the statute. Hiring others did not adversely affect 

Petitioners because they were --

Justice Stevens's hypothetical? What is the difference 

between those people and each person who does not have a 

high school diploma is not -- and is not hired? Does 

that mean that the moment that they announce the high 

school diploma requirement, that everybody who had 

already received one, whether they wanted to work at 

this job or not, had to sue, and it's only those people 

who just received the high school diploma who can sue 

10 years later? 

MS. SOLOMON: The statute requires that the --

the complainant be limited and classified in their 

employment opportunity. So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what is the 

difference between the policy announcement that each 

time I hire, I'm not going to use a high school -- I'm 

not going to look at people who don't have a high school 

diploma, and I'm not going to look at people who don't 

have a test score above 89. What's the difference 

between those? 

MS. SOLOMON: The difference is that once 

Petitioners here were classified out of the eligible 

pool for priority hiring, they were out. They were 

simply out. They were not being considered anymore at 

all. We didn't go back to look at the test. We didn't 

consider Petitioners. We didn't reject them each time.

people who were classified as well qualified in that 

letter --

MS. SOLOMON: With respect --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- did you? 

MS. SOLOMON: With respect, Justice Alito, 

the letter does say that because of the large number of 

people who were classified well-qualified, a step ahead 

of where Petitioners were classified, it was not likely 

that they were going to be hired. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Right. That's right. 

MS. SOLOMON: And for that reason, that is 

when the injury and the impact was felt. Whatever else 

later happened, whether Chicago hired a lot of people, 

Chicago hired no one, whether Chicago even hired some of

the Petitioners, they had years' worth of delay. And at 

this point in the litigation, it is undisputed. The City 

made 149 hires from the first use of the list. That's 

more than any other class --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to follow up on 

Justice Alito's question, what if it were different? 

What if the letter said, look, you didn't get, you’re 

not well qualified, but we really do expect to hire a lot 

more, so, you know, keep your fingers crossed. There’s 

a good chance that you are going to be hired. 

And you say those people should have sued 

right then? 

MS. SOLOMON: Correct. Because the impact, 

at a minimum, is the delay in hiring. And the Court has 

made quite clear that you don't -- a complainant or 

plaintiff does not have to feel all of the consequences 

right at the outset to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's kind of 

a bad policy, isn't it? You’re telling people who may 

probably not be injured at all -- you are saying, well, 

you still have to go into Federal court and sue. 

MS. SOLOMON: With respect, Chief Justice 

Roberts, they are injured. Their hiring will be 

delayed, possibly substantially.

understand that, but, you know, let's say we

through, we think we’re going to hire everybody else 

by -- in 4 months. And you’re saying, well, those 

people have to sue anyway because they are injured by 

the 4-month delay. 

MS. SOLOMON: They are injured by a 

4-month delay. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 

MS. SOLOMON: But there may be circumstances 

in which information is not conveyed in a way that would 

put a reasonable person on notice that he or she had a 

claim right at the outset, and that relates also to the 

high school diploma hypothetical. If the --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why did the City 

say that it was planning to give a new test in 3 

years and then wait more than a decade before giving a 

new test? If I received one of these qualified letters, 

and I also -- and I knew in addition that the City was 

going to give a test in 3 years, that might well 

affect my incentive about bringing a lawsuit to 

challenge this. 

MS. SOLOMON: But it wouldn't change the 

fact that there had been, at least a -- if you wait for 

the next list, you still have been delayed at least 3

years in your ability to be hired as a firefighter. And 

as far as the reason why we didn't follow through on the 

aspirational goal of giving another test within 3 years, 

the tests are very difficult and expensive to deliver, 

I think -- to develop, excuse me. The record in 

this case actually makes that clear. 

Despite rather significant steps, including 

the use of a prominent African-American industrial 

psychologist to develop this test, it had severe adverse 

impact. The test actually compares rather favorably to 

the test that was given in the City of New Haven, but 

the district court invalidated it, and, you know, we did 

undertake to develop a new test. But --

JUSTICE ALITO: But you don't challenge 

that.

JUSTICE ALITO: You don't challenge that. 

You now acknowledge that the Plaintiffs were treated 

unlawfully. 

MS. SOLOMON: We have not pressed that 

claim. That is correct, Justice Alito, but --

JUSTICE ALITO: And were you prejudiced by 

the delay in the filing of the EEOC charge?

responsible for setting the cutoff score could not 

remember. But a statute of limitations actually doesn't 

require prejudice, so we didn't undertake to try to 

prove that. The -- repose arises naturally at the end 

of the charging period. It's not something that -- that 

the defendant has to earn either by capitulating to the 

plaintiffs' demands or otherwise proving prejudice. 

And in a case like this, it -- it wasn't 

possible simply to take the list down. The Court's 

opinion in Ricci makes that quite clear. Our expert 

told us all the way through the trial -- he testified 

at the trial --

got a passing score, anyone who is qualified -- we’re not 

going to make the distinction between qualified and 

unqualified.

misuse of the test scores. The expert was resolute even 

through the trial --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the expert 

said -- the test devisor said he didn't make up that 

89 percent cutoff. That was Chicago that made that --

that decision. 

MS. SOLOMON: He -- his reason for 

suggesting the 65 cutoff score was because of the 

adverse impact. That was an attempt to deal with 

adverse impact, but his position was the test was valid 

to measure the cognitive aspects that it was attempting 

to measure, and that those related to the training 

firefighters had to undergo in the academy. 

And he was clear as well, that a higher 

score created an inference that the person was more 

qualified to -- to perform in the way --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you've lost --

you've lost on that. 

MS. SOLOMON: We have. But the reason that 

I’m mentioning it is because it's not simply a matter 

of -- of why don't you take the list down. At the time

can -- it gives rise to an inference that people closer 

to the top are better -- possess more of the cognitive

at a minimum been courting disparate treatment liability 

to adjust the scores, to randomize them further, or to 

take the list down. But to return --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, but -- but going to 

65, opening up the classification, is not adjusting the 

scores; it's not taking the list down; it's just saying 

anyone who passes the test can proceed to the next step. 

MS. SOLOMON: It seriously diminished the 

opportunities of the people who were at 89 and above. 

There were about 1,700 applicants at 89 or above, and 

there were 22,000 65 or above. So calling in random 

order --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You've got to -- I 

mean, you’ve just got to take your -- get as good 

legal advice as you can and determine is it -- are we 

going to be in more trouble if we follow the test or 

more trouble if we -- if we take it down? 

People have to do that all the time. They 

look -- well, if I do this, I'm going to be in trouble; 

if I do this, I'm going to -- but I have got to decide 

what I should do.

Read in conjunction with the 300 -- you have got to 

finish that sentence at least, before --

MS. SOLOMON: I -- I'm sorry. That 

was the -- so, yes, at the point where the employer is 

assessing the options, the City was not sued within --

excuse me, charges were not filed within 300 days after 

the tiered eligibility list was adopted and announced. 

Petitioners were aware that it had adverse impact. No 

charges were filed then; no charges were filed after the 

first use of the list. 

So at some point when the employer is 

weighing the options, the employer can also factor in 

the time to challenge this has passed. 

What Petitioners seek here is new 

opportunities -- 11 -- 10 opportunities to challenge 

exactly the same thing that they -- that they would have 

challenged if they had filed a charge promptly. They 

continue to emphasize that the eligibility pool, when 

compared with the pool of applicants, had a disparate 

impact. But that's not a new violation. That's not a 

new classification, and it doesn't limit anybody's 

opportunities in any way beyond what they were already 

limited. That's the old violation. That's the one they 

didn't charge.

Now, Petitioners do claim that the shortfall 

evidence showed that they -- showed and the use of the 

list had disparate impact each time. But it actually 

didn't, either. That also was the old violation. That 

shortfall was compiled by comparing the number of 

African-Americans who were hired using the 89 cutoff 

score and the number who would have been called for 

further processing if --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you -- the problem I 

have with all of this -- it makes entire sense, except 

when you read subpart (k), it says “an unlawful 

employment practice based on disparate impact is 

established” if “a complaining party demonstrates that a 

respondent uses a particular employment practice that 

causes a disparate impact on the basis of race.” 

MS. SOLOMON: Correct. But you have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is what happened 

here. 

MS. SOLOMON: But the fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They used --

MS. SOLOMON: Excuse me, Justice Scalia. 

The statute goes on, and it describes the later things 

that happened at trial. So in our view, read

on? To say what? 

MS. SOLOMON: It goes on to say that the 

respondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged 

process is job-related, or subpart (ii), there is 

an alternative practice with less disparate impact. So 

-- so (k), if (k) is going to be consulted at all, and 

we do not think that it should be, because section 

706(e), which has always been thought of as the charging 

period, talks about an alleged unlawful practice, and 

that's what the person knows at the outset. 

Section (k) talks about the burden of proof 

and how you go about proving these at trial, and that's 

why it uses the word "established." But that's also why 

it describes the entirety of what happens at trial. 

Read literally, you can pluck a few words out of the --

out of one of these provisions and say, aha, they used 

an employment practice. You have to read the whole 

thing together if you’re going to read it at all, and 

when you read the whole thing together, you come up with 

the absurd result that the charging period doesn't run 

until the district court brings the gavel down and 

determines that an unlawful practice has been 

established. 

In this case, that would have meant that the 

people 65 and below could file charges within 300 days

after the district court's decision, which is something 

like 11 years after the practice in this case. And 

that's because that was the moment at which it was 

established. And that's why we think that (k) does not 

bear on this. And (h) --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is my impression -- is 

there anything else in that (k)? You see, it lists 

about 10 things, let's say 10 -- imagine. One of 

those things is that it was used. Now, all the other 

things there will not have been -- are things that --

that -- to do with the test, basically. So you have 

like six or seven that have to do with the test and the 

criteria, and then you have one that it was used. 

MS. SOLOMON: Right, and that's why --

JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and so I thought, 

looking at the list, it's quite right that it's used for 

a different purpose but --

MS. SOLOMON: It's not --

JUSTICE BREYER: But, I mean, this (k) has 

to do with a different thing, but -- but -- and the 

critical element of it was that the practice be used. 

MS. SOLOMON: You -- but again, even if (k) 

is consulted -- and for the reasons that I just outlined 

we don't think that it should be. It doesn't bear on 

accrual. But even if (k) is consulted, it doesn't --

it doesn't say that any use of an employment practice is

say that all the things that are there, the other nine 

and so forth -- all those nine things --

MS. SOLOMON: This is actually --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well --

MS. SOLOMON: Excuse me, Justice Breyer. 

This is actually a slightly different point. At the 

outset, I indicated why section (k) does not bear on 

accrual at all; it describes what happens at trial, and

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

words out of the middle. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, well, that's true --

it does --

MS. SOLOMON: But even if one is going to 

consult it to determine accrual, what it says is that 

the use of an employment practice with adverse impact. 

And in this case there was only one, and that one was 

when Petitioners were limited and classified based on 

the test scores. Nothing that happened after that, 

including hiring others, was an unlawful practice with

disparate impact in a way that affected the Petitioners. 

They had already been rejected. 

When an employer says, I will not consider 

you for the position, or perhaps it says, I will not 

consider you for the position until I have considered a 

lot of other people first, that is a rejection. Nothing 

that happens after that, whether the person hires 

somebody else, whether the person doesn't hire somebody 

else, whether they change their mind and later hire the 

person whom they had previously rejected -- Ricks, after 

all had a grievance pending. It was certainly possible 

that that would change the outcome in the case, but the 

Court, nonetheless, says you cannot wait for the 

consequences to be felt. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was a disparate 

treatment case. 

MS. SOLOMON: Correct, but there is no --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the -- the argument 

here is disparate impact is different because there’s 

no need to show intent of disparate impact. 

MS. SOLOMON: Correct. But the only 

practice in this case that had a disparate impact in the 

sense used by the statute was when the tiered 

eligibility list was made. After that, of course there 

was a consequence of that. Consequences can be felt in

employment for a long time. The people in the 

well-qualified pool were hired before Petitioners, they 

were paid before Petitioners, they are going to get 

their pensions before Petitioners. Those things 

continue to have consequences. 

But the Court has made clear that the 

consequences cannot be challenged by themselves unless 

there actually is a present violation. 

Now, there is not even an argument in the 

other side's briefs, neither of them, that explains why 

there was an adverse impact based on race under (a)(2) 

at any point when the City used the list. If one reads 

the briefs very carefully, one will see that those times 

when a claim is made in the briefs that we used an 

unlawful practice, it always goes back to the test and 

the list. 

Simply keeping the list up after we announce 

it is not a new violation. It is quite clear in the 

cases that the employer does not have to change a 

decision in order to obtain repose. 

And, of course, the disparate treatment and 

disparate impact are simply different methods of proving 

a claim. They are not different claims by themselves. 

In this case, in addition to the statutory language, 

there are a number of policy reasons that while we don't

rely on them heavily, we do rely on the statute. They 

should nonetheless be considered in deciding this. 

There was no sense in which a claim filed to challenge 

the list was premature. It was the one act that 

actually limited and classified Petitioners. 

Everything else that happened after that 

either didn't affect the Petitioners at all, as in 

hiring people who had made the cut, or it affected them 

only in the colloquial sense, that the consequences of 

the prior act continued. 

Chicago did not have to revisit this in 

order to obtain repose. The statute makes that quite 

clear. 

Mr. Payton emphasizes only the policy of 

righting employment wrongs, but there are other policies 

in the statute. In addition to repose, the statute 

makes clear that claims should be brought to the EEOC at 

the earliest opportunity. 

Excuse me. We ask that the judgment be 

affirmed.

This is a case about jobs. And I want to 

read from the letter that Justice Alito was referring 

to. This is the letter that the qualifieds received. 

It's in our Joint Appendix at JA-35, and it's the last 

sentence of the first paragraph. 

This is the letter that they all got. This 

is the letter that Arthur Lewis, the named person in the 

case, got. However, it says: You are qualified; you 

are qualified; there are well-qualifieds. And it's 

unlikely -- that language is there. 

And then it says: "However, because it 

is not possible at this time to predict how many 

applicants will be hired in the next few years, 

your name will be kept on the eligible list 

maintained by the department of personnel for as 

long as that list is used." 

I did focus on the word "used." And it's 

not only in section (k). It's also in section (h), 

where it says, "used to discriminate." Because it's an 

ordinary word that the City used itself in advising 

the Petitioners in this case. 

In the answer to the complaint in this case, 

which is at Joint Appendix 19, the -- I'm sorry, Joint 

Appendix 16, the answer to -- actually, the first 

paragraph in the complaint in this case, the City says

as follows -- this is the second sentence in the answer 

to the complaint: “Defendant” -- the City -- “admits 

that it has used and continues to use results of the 1995 

firefighter entrance examination as part of its 

firefighter hiring process.” Using an unlawful cutoff 

score -- and the eligibility list is nothing other than 

the functional equivalent of the cutoff score -- using 

that to make decisions on those 11 times is a violation 

of Title VII. 

And the argument that there is no additional 

impact -- it is the dramatic difference between being told 

what someone intends to do and then they do it. You are 

told that maybe your chances are going to be minimal in 

the future, or maybe 50/50, but then when it actually 

starts happening and you see other people start getting 

jobs, that's an impact. That's a consequence. 

When I said the animating principle in 

Title VII and disparate impact is result and 

consequences, it's results and consequences. Those 

are additional impacts that go with the additional 

uses that clearly establish a violation of Title VII's 

disparate impact prohibition in this case. 

I don't think that the statutory language is 

actually -- I think the best reading, as I said, of the 

statutory language is as I said. I think the policies

behind how that works -- it is 300 days after every use. 

There is a statute, but, in fact, the control over that 

is entirely within the City. If they stopped using this 

unlawful cutoff score after 300 days, they are 

completely done with any potential liability. 

And the point is you want that to be 

challenged, because we don't want unlawful employment 

practices to continue to go forever and ever and ever 

and ever out there. And we can see, in this very case, 

that if you don't allow the challenge, the practice goes 

on and is inconsistent with the -- I’d say the 

national policy to rid our workplace of discrimination. 

Are there any other questions otherwise? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
