3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next in Case 09-479, Abbott v. United States, and the 

consolidated case, 7073, Gould v. United States. 

6  Mr. Horan. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. HORAN 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 09-7073 

9  MR. HORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  The statutory interpretation question here 

12 is what laws trigger section 924(c)(1)(A)'s "except" 

13 clause. Mr. Gould offers an interpretation that gives 

14 meaning and effect to every word and phrase of section 

924(c)(1)(A) and that follows this Court's recent 

16 holdings regarding the broad scope of the phrase "any 

17 other provision of law." 

18  The government, on the other hand, advocates 

19 a narrow construction that is not supported by the text 

and defends it primarily on the basis that section 

21 924(c) supposedly should always produce the most severe 

22 mandatory minimum sentence for every defendant. 

23  Respectfully, the government's 

24 interpretation is incorrect. Its reading gives no 

practical effect to the phrase "any other provision of 

4
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

25

Official 

1 law," and the government has not cited and has yet to 

2 even attempt to distinguish this Court's recent 

3 interpretation of the very same phrase, "any other 

4 provision of law," in Republic of Iraq v. Beaty just 

last year. 

6  Unlike the government's, Mr. Gould's 

7 interpretation is true to the text; it is true to this 

8 Court's holdings; and it's true to Congress's evident 

9 purpose in 924(c)(1)(A), and in particular in its 

"except" clause. 

11  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if the text of this is 

12 so clear, how is it that Mr. Gould and Mr. Abbott 

13 propose different interpretations of this provision? 

14  MR. HORAN: Your Honor, as a judicial 

matter, I would note that I think our interpretations 

16 are not that far apart. But -­

17  JUSTICE ALITO: But they are not the same, 

18 are they? 

19  MR. HORAN: They are not. And our 

interpretation, we believe, is the closest to the actual 

21 text. Our interpretation requires reading no language 

22 into the text. It -­

23  JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there -- isn't it -­

24 there is a missing prepositional phrase in this -- in 

the provision that we are looking at? 

5

1  It says, "except to the extent that a 

2 greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided." For 

3 what? And all of you have to -- are filling in the 

4 prepositional phrase. For an offense of conviction, 

for -- for an offense that's part of the --of the 

6 underlying transaction, for a violation of this 

7 particular provision or one that's very similar to it. 

8  There is just no way of getting around the 

9 fact that something has to be read in there. Something 

is implied; isn't that right? 

11  MR. HORAN: Your Honor, respectfully, I 

12 believe under our interpretation, it -- there is -- you 

13 do have to understand something to be in there, but we 

14 are not actually reading anything into the text. That 

is the reason -- to be sure, the words "any kind of 

16 conviction" are not in there. 

17  However, the most natural reading of the 

18 text, without adding anything to it, is that 

19 924(c)(1)(A) requires a 5-year -- at least a 5-year 

minimum sentence, in addition to any sentence for the 

21 predicate drug trafficking or violent crime, except to 

22 the extent that a greater minimum sentence is provided 

23 for the defendant by subsection 924(c) or by any other 

24 provision of law.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that means there would 

6

Official 

1 be no punishment, added punishment, at all for the 

2 possession of the gun; that is, you have the -- the 

3 possession with intent to distribute, no gun involved, 

4 and you get 10 years mandatory minimum for that. That 

automatically would wipe out any add-on for the gun, 

6 under your reading. 

7  MR. HORAN: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 

8 And to follow on that, it is true that our 

9 interpretation -- we think that the plain text dictates 

that if the "except" clause is triggered, the lesser 

11 mandatory minimum sentence under 924(c)(1)(A) shall not 

12 be imposed; that is -­

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You keep 

14 saying that you're not reading anything into the statute 

under your interpretation, but you are. You are 

16 limiting the -- the "any other provision of law" to any 

17 other provision of law specified in the charging -- in 

18 the counts of conviction, correct? 

19  MR. HORAN: That is the -- yes, Your Honor. 

We are recognizing that limitation. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you -- you said to 

22 Justice Alito that you weren't reading anything in, but 

23 you are. You're reading into it that the other 

24 provision of -- of law to refer to counts of conviction 

at sentencing, correct?

1  MR. HORAN: That is correct, Your Honor. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So why is 

3 that read-in logical, meaning it's giving no extra 

4 punishment for the possession of a firearm?

 MR. HORAN: Your Honor, two things -­

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which was, I think, 

7 Justice Ginsburg's -­

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. I think you weren't 

9 finished answering my question.

 MR. HORAN: If I may -- and I think then -­

11 I think it will help in answering your question, Justice 

12 Sotomayor. That is correct. The only thing I would 

13 say -- the thing I would additionally say, though, is 

14 that there is, under the sentencing guidelines, which 

must be applied even now, as -- to provide a recommended 

16 range, there would in each of these instances be a 

17 firearm enhancement that enhances the underlying 

18 predicate offenses' sentence that the defendant would be 

19 facing and also how the -- the district court would 

work. So I believe -­

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that is not 

22 mandatory? 

23  MR. HORAN: That is no longer mandatory. 

24 That is correct.

 And then with regard to your question,

Official 

1 Justice -­

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you're saying that the 

3 gun possession can be accounted for by the judge as a 

4 matter of discretion using guidelines, but there's no 

mandatory at all? 

6  MR. HORAN: Yes, Your Honor. That is 

7 correct. There would no longer be a mandatory sentence 

8 for -- or mandatory additional punishment for the 

9 firearm possession.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and I suppose the 

11 prosecution can alter the consequence based on what it 

12 chooses to bring in a single prosecution. 

13  I mean, if it has other -- other 

14 enhancements, it should bring a separate prosecution for 

that. So long as it brings it in one suit, you say, in 

16 one prosecution, you get the break. But if -- if the 

17 other enhancement is brought -- has been brought in a 

18 separate prosecution, you don't get it. 

19  MR. HORAN: Justice Scalia, I think that's 

correct to an extent. The -- the main exception to 

21 that -- and I think it's a significant one -- is that 

22 the "except" clause would most often be triggered in the 

23 mine run of cases by the predicate drug trafficking or 

24 violent crime that carries with it a greater mandatory 

minimum sentence. That is, for double jeopardy 

9

1 purposes, the same offense as 924(c). 

2  So, in fact, there is a significant 

3 constraint on the prosecution, that it cannot bring a 

4 separate prosecution for 924(c) and its predicate drug 

or trafficking -- drug trafficking or violent crime. So 

6 it's a significant limitation on this -­

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. Yes, I understand 

8 what you're saying. 

9  MR. HORAN: Okay. And Justice Sotomayor, to 

return to your question, if I could answer it in two 

11 parts. First -- and I didn't mean to overstate, if I 

12 did -- we are not reading additional language into it. 

13 Our reading is contained within the context and the 

14 actual text that -- that is confined to section 924(c).

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Explain how, because you 

16 just said to Justice Scalia that if the mandatory 

17 minimum is in a separate charging instrument, then it 

18 doesn't affect you at all. It only affects you if the 

19 count is in a count of conviction at sentencing.

 MR. HORAN: Yes, Your Honor. That is 

21 correct. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what in the language 

23 of 924(c) sets forth that limitation? 

24  MR. HORAN: Your Honor, I would say that it 

is the words "is otherwise provided" and the context in

Official 

1 which any textual reading -­

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but there 

3 "otherwise provided by law" could be Federal, State 

4 laws. It could be in the indictment, not in the 

indictment. You're proposing that we limit this 

6 somehow, but I want to see what the language is that 

7 you're relying upon to limit it. 

8  MR. HORAN: Your Honor, it is -- first of 

9 all, the statute begins by directing the defendant -- I 

mean, directing the district court to "any person." So 

11 they're focusing on the defendant. That is the 

12 offense-defining provision, to be sure, of the sentence. 

13  But the -- throughout the text, it also 

14 directs the district court to take account of minimum 

sentences that are provided for other crimes; for 

16 instance, primarily the predicate -­

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In relationship to what? 

18 Isn't that the government's argument, which is that you 

19 have to say in relationship to something, whether it's 

the indictment or, as the government would have it, in 

21 relationship to the possession or carrying of a firearm? 

22 Why isn't that the more natural reading? 

23  MR. HORAN: Your Honor, because that -­

24 because the statute as a whole is essentially 

instructions to the district court on how to sentence a 

11
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

Official 

1 defendant, if at all, for the 924(c)(1)(A) offense. 

2  It directs them to, after considering the 

3 person in front of them, to impose a sentence of 5 years 

4 or less, in addition to the predicate -- any penalty for 

the -- the predicate drug trafficking or violent crime, 

6 except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is 

7 otherwise provided. 

8  The natural reading of that is -- and must 

9 be -- that it is a -- a greater minimum sentence is 

provided for that defendant; that is, before the 

11 particular district court with the particular offenses 

12 that he has before him at sentencing. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Don't most crimes of 

14 violence and drug trafficking carry more than a 5-year 

sentence? 

16  MR. HORAN: Many of them do, Your Honor. In 

17 fact, those that carry a mandatory minimum sentence 

18 largely carry -- all carry, in fact, 10 years. 

19  There are some -- there are some both 

predicate drug trafficking offenses and predicate 

21 violent crimes that carry either no minimum at all or a 

22 mandatory minimum of 5 years or less, and so would not 

23 trigger the except clause. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: So let's suppose somebody 

commits a rape and a maiming in the same -- in the same 

12

1 criminal act. You're saying that the prosecution -- and 

2 let's assume it's his third. It's his third violent 

3 crime. So he would get the enhancement as being, you 

4 know, a three-time violent crime loser.

 You're saying he could get that enhancement 

6 and the enhancement under this -- under this gun -- he 

7 had a gun at the same time. He can get it if the 

8 prosecution charges rape in one prosecution, for which 

9 he will get the three-time loser enhancement, and then 

in a separate prosecution, it charges maiming and the 

11 use of a firearm. Then he gets both enhancements, 

12 right? 

13  MR. HORAN: That's correct, Your Honor. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: That seems -­

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not sure that that's 

16 right. I think that -- that this may well apply to the 

17 crime that is being -- that is being prosecuted where 

18 the crime is defined as a real offense in the world, 

19 with the limitations put on that term by the guidelines. 

I would think that would be a natural reading, in which 

21 case you'd look to the conduct of the person. 

22  And if the conduct of the person is such 

23 that it calls for a mandatory minimum of a certain kind, 

24 there we are. And if that exceeds this amount, there we 

are. You can't apply it. And if it doesn't, you do

1 apply it. 

2  MR. HORAN: Yes. 

3  JUSTICE BREYER: Have you looked into that? 

4 I mean, that was my reading of it as -- in the most 

natural way. The word "crime" is ambiguous. Sometimes 

6 it means words in a statute. Sometimes it means an 

7 affair in the world. And I thought this one probably 

8 meant the affair in the world. 

9  MR. HORAN: Well, in answering your 

question, Justice Breyer, in answering Justice Scalia's 

11 question, my assumption was that there were, in fact, 

12 mandatory minimums such that this would play out with 

13 one being greater than the other. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he's disagreeing with 

you. He -- your theory -- you're not reading "crime" to 

16 mean an affair in the world. You're reading it to mean 

17 a particular prosecution for a particular violation of a 

18 statute. Right? 

19  MR. HORAN: No, that's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I read that -­

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: He wants to read it as an 

22 affair in the world, whatever that means. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: If that's so, then this 

24 gives tremendous power to the prosecutor to decide what 

the sentence will be in terms of how he manipulates the 

14

1 charge. And I thought that probably this, read with the 

2 guidelines, is designed not to -- not to permit that. 

3 It's to minimize the discretion, not to maximize. 

4  MR. HORAN: Your Honor, there will be 

circumstances in which a -- the prosecutor and the 

6 government, based on how it makes its charging 

7 decisions, can affect the floor that's created by the 

8 minimum sentence. 

9  It's a different situation than Deal, which 

was actually determinant sentences. It's not actually a 

11 circumstance where the government can determine the 

12 punishment itself. That would still be to the district 

13 court. 

14  But we maintain that this is the most 

natural reading. And, in fact, for instance, when this 

16 concern came up in Deal, that was to confirm the most 

17 natural reading of the plain text. The government would 

18 actually turn that analysis on its head under these 

19 circumstances.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Justice Breyer is 

21 reading a bit what your co-counsel is advocating, what 

22 Mr. Abbott is arguing? 

23  MR. HORAN: No, Your Honor. I -­

1 makes any difference. I mean, has there ever been such 

2 a case where the prosecutor worked this in such a way 

3 that he would produce this? 

4  Are you aware if any such case ever 

happened? 

6  MR. HORAN: No, I'm -- I'm not aware of 

7 that, Your Honor, in part because the "except" clause is 

8 -- there aren't that many instances of the "except" 

9 clause having been actually applied.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And there has never been 

11 the incentive to do so, until we accept your 

12 interpretation. Then there will be means to do so. 

13  MR. HORAN: There may be -- Justice Scalia, 

14 there may be some incentive do so, subject to other 

constraints, including the -- the usual practice of 

16 charging, for instance, most offenses as they come under 

17 the transaction in the same indictment. There will be 

18 counterincentives, to be sure. 

19  Your Honors, for the -- in addition to the 

fact that our interpretation does not involve, we think, 

21 adding anything into the text that others must, we think 

22 it establishes -- it advances an evident purpose that 

23 Congress had in this, which was to ensure that a 

24 defendant who is convicted under 924(c)(1)(A) receives 

some sufficient minimum punishment.

11  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. RYAN 

12  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 09-479 

13  MR. RYAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

14 please the Court:

 I'd like to spend some time on the second 

16 question in our petition regarding whether other 

17 firearms offenses are included within the scope of the 

18 "except" clause. 

19  But before I do, I'd like to make a couple 

of points about the first question, which is common to 

21 our case and to Mr. Gould's. 

22  Justice Sotomayor asked: Why isn't the 

23 government's reading the most natural? And the answer 

24 is pretty simple. The government's reading leaves one 

half of the "effect" clause with absolutely no practical 

17
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 effect. 

2  The government has, in its current 

3 interpretation, suggested that the "except" clause 

4 applies to one provision of law outside of 924(c). 

That's 3559(c). And yet with respect to that provision, 

6 the "except" clause does absolutely no work, both for 

7 practical reasons and because of the way 3559(c) is 

8 written. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 930(c): A person who 

kills any person in the course of bringing a firearm 

11 into a Federal facility shall be punished as provided in 

12 sections setting forth minimums for murder and 

13 manslaughter. So it would also have an effect in 

14 930(c), no?

 MR. RYAN: It's not clear from the 

16 government's argument, Justice Sotomayor. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I wasn't sure why it 

18 didn't list 930(c), but -­

19  MR. RYAN: As I understand the government's 

argument, the sentence that -- the only sentence that 

21 would count outside of 924(c) would be a sentence 

22 specifically for a 924(c)(1)(A) offense -­

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know, but its brief 

24 does two formulations. It says -­

MR. RYAN: Exactly right.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- anything that affects 

2 924(c), and then in other places in its brief, it says 

3 the -- the "except" clause refers to any higher minimum 

4 sentence for possessing, using, or carrying a firearm in 

relationship to a drug or -- drug offense or a crime of 

6 violence. Those are two different formulations. 

7  MR. RYAN: That's exactly right, Justice 

8 Sotomayor. And if the -­

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm focusing on the 

second formulation. 

11  MR. RYAN: Okay. That point actually 

12 demonstrates why the government's justification for this 

13 limitation doesn't hold up. As the government argues at 

14 one point, the reason to read "any other provision of 

law" to include only sentences for 924(c)(1)(A) crimes 

16 is because the "except" clause, when it refers to this 

17 subsection, refers only to sentences for section 

18 924(c)(1)(A) offenses. 

19  Yet, that is not the case. As this Court 

indicated in O'Brien, 924(c)(1)(B) is a separate 

21 offense. Well, if 924(c)(1)(B) can trigger the "except" 

22 clause, and it's not the same offense as 924(c)(1)(A), 

23 the government's argument about excluding other offenses 

24 that might be separate from 924(c)(1)(A) no longer holds 

up.

1  The other difficulty with the government's 

2 reading, to go back to the practical point, is that if 

3 you apply it just to 3559(c), it can have no effect 

4 because as a practical matter no one can serve a term of 

years after successfully completing a life sentence, 

6 which is what's required under 3559(c); and 3559(c) 

7 itself has a provision that, the "notwithstanding" 

8 provision, that makes clear that only the life sentence 

9 should be imposed when 924(c) is the third strike for 

purposes of 3559(c). 

11  That, in turn, just leaves future 

12 applications, and there the government's scenario under 

13 which the language that currently has no effect might 

14 have some effect is nothing short of far-fetched. It 

would require Congress to amend the sentence of 

16 924(c)(1)(A) outside of 924(c)(1)(A) and not indicate 

17 how those two penalties should interact. 

18  Now, if I could turn to the questions about 

19 a transactional limitation, which we suggest. The point 

of suggesting that the "except" clause should be limited 

21 to sentences for the same transaction is suggested by 

22 some of the questions directed to Mr. Gould's counsel. 

23 We think that it's the more natural reading of the 

24 statute in part because of concerns recognized by this 

Court in the United States v. Deal, namely that the

1 statute is not designed and should not be read to give 

2 prosecutors unreviewable discretion as to when the 

3 minimum sentence in 924(c) ought to be applied or not. 

4  It also would preclude the equally odd 

situation of a defendant being able to benefit from the 

6 "except" clause in a multi-count indictment when the 

7 defendant has -- faces a higher mandatory minimum 

8 sentence for a completely unrelated -- unrelated charge. 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: Where would we look to find 

the definition of a criminal transaction for these 

11 purposes? 

12  MR. RYAN: You could look into 924(c) 

13 itself. Our view is that it would be no different than 

14 the transaction that would give rise to the 924(c) 

charge itself and so, for that reason, would necessarily 

16 include the predicate offense or another firearms 

17 offense. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: What if there were several 

19 924(c) offenses committed during a rather brief period 

of time? What if on the same afternoon an individual 

21 engaged in a number of drug trafficking offenses and 

22 during each of those used or carried a firearm? Would 

23 they -- would they be part of the same criminal 

24 transaction?

1 different transactions can lead to multiple 924(c) 

2 charges, which is what happened in Deal, that could also 

3 occur here. 

4  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you say "different 

transactions," but I'm looking for the definition of a 

6 criminal transaction. The criminal law has labored with 

7 this for a long time. It's not a self-defining concept, 

8 is it, a criminal transaction? 

9  MR. RYAN: No, it's not, but -- Your Honor, 

but I don't see how it would be any more difficult to 

11 determine the transaction than to look at what would 

12 constitute the 924(c) offense. It would be the same set 

13 of operative facts that could lead to a 924(c) charge 

14 which would count as the transaction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Ryan, I thought that 

16 you had three positions, and now you're talking about 

17 the second one, which is any greater minimum sentence 

18 arising from the same criminal episode. But I thought 

19 your first position was any greater minimum sentence 

applicable to the defendant at sentencing.

1  MR. RYAN: Well, the way it would have to 

2 work is that there would have to be a previous 

3 conviction. 

4  Now, if I could turn to the firearms 

argument. Our argument here is straightforward. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, before you go 

7 on. Your last remark -- it has to be a previous 

8 conviction. So why doesn't that leave it in the hands 

9 of the prosecutor whether to bring that conviction, that 

other case, prior or subsequent? 

11  MR. RYAN: I -- I misspoke, Justice Scalia. 

12 You're exactly right. It would include uncharged. It 

13 would -- it would prohibit prosecutors from being able 

14 to use charging instruments to determine whether 924(c) 

would apply. I was thinking of a particular example, 

16 but in the general case, you're right. I apologize for 

17 that misstatement. 

18  Now, if I could just spend a little bit of 

19 time on our second question. Our argument here is 

fairly straightforward and fairly modest, and it relies 

21 on the fact that 924(c) is essentially a firearms 

22 offense. And the punishment provided in the different 

23 paragraphs in 924(c) are primarily about firearms. And 

24 so, in looking to determine the meaning of "any other 

provision of law," it is quite natural, as both the

1 First Circuit recognized and as the government 

2 recognized in Whitley, the Second Circuit case, to 

3 include provisions of law outside of 924(c) that punish 

4 firearms offenses.

 Now, to be sure, this particular limitation 

6 is not commanded by the plain language of the statute 

7 and rests, like the government's argument, on context 

8 and purpose. But the difference is that this argument 

9 still gives some effect to the "except" clause. It 

would apply, as here, to other firearms offenses outside 

11 of 924(c) like the Armed Career Criminal Act. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, it gives broader 

13 effect. It gives broader effect to the "except" clause, 

14 but the government's argument gives effect to the 

"except" clause, doesn't it? 

16  MR. RYAN: It gives no practical -­

17  JUSTICE ALITO: 3559(c), which was enacted 

18 at the same time as this "except" clause, wasn't it, and 

19 makes explicit reference to -- to 924(c)?

 MR. RYAN: Two points, Justice Alito. 

21 First, the government's reading has no practical effect. 

22 It leaves the "except" cause with no practical effect. 

23 You could take the "except" clause away, and there would 

24 be no difference in terms of the sentence under 3559(c).

 As for the enactment of 3559(c), the

1 government's argument is actually different. The 

2 government argues that when 3559(c) was amended to 

3 include possession -­

4  JUSTICE ALITO: Yes.

 MR. RYAN: -- it was at that point that the 

6 "except" clause also entered into 924(c). 

7  The difficulty with that argument, as we 

8 explain in our brief, is that 3559(c) was already linked 

9 with 924(c) insofar as both addressed use. And because 

3559(c) and 924(c) were already linked, and the 

11 "notwithstanding" provision within 3559(c) indicated 

12 that if the 924(c) offense is your third strike, you get 

13 the life sentence, that's it. Well, the fact that 

14 Congress then amended 3559(c) to make another connection 

with 924(c) can't possibly explain why there is a sudden 

16 need for the "except" clause. 

17  But the question is an -- is an important 

18 one because it goes to the fact that the government has 

19 offered three different interpretations of the language 

in this case. The first -- one of the first was in 

21 Whitley, where it suggested "any other provision of law" 

22 includes other firearms offenses outside of 924(c), 

23 provided that they impose a consecutive sentence. That 

24 argument was rejected for the idea that, instead, 

924(c)'s "except" clause actually applies to no existing

1 provisions of law. And now the Government argues that 

2 it applies to one, 3559(c), and it has come up with a 

3 new theory as to why the "except" clause exists in the 

4 first place.

 But that theory doesn't hold up, and the 

6 government's shifting interpretations, if nothing else, 

7 suggest that the government has not hit upon the most 

8 natural reading. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have offered 

three different readings, so one can't say that this 

11 statutory text has a clear meaning, which I think is 

12 your first argument -- that it has a clear meaning. And 

13 yet, we have Mr. Gould's reading and then the two 

14 readings that you've offered us, same episode and same 

gun. 

16  MR. RYAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. We think 

17 our first argument is the most natural and the clearest, 

18 but I take your point. And the only response I would 

19 make is, if shifting interpretations or different 

interpretations suggest that at the end of the day the 

21 language is ambiguous and grievously so, under the rule 

22 of lenity, we ought to prevail. So I'm perfectly 

23 comfortable with that conclusion.

4  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. MCLEESE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

6 please the Court: 

7  A district court judge in -­

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could I just 

9 ask one simple question, the one I started with earlier, 

which was, which of the two statements are you 

11 advocating? That the "except" refers to a provision 

12 that imposes a greater minimum sentence for violating 

13 924(c) explicitly, or are you saying the "except" 

14 clause -- and I'm quoting from your brief, in two 

different places -- the "except" clause refers to a 

16 higher minimum sentence for possessing, using a firearm 

17 in relationship to a crime of violence or a drug 

18 offense? 

19  MR. MCLEESE: I don't think there needs to 

be an explicit reference. I think that the "except" 

21 clause is triggered by an offense which has a greater 

22 mandatory minimum and which has the same elements as and 

23 is the same offense as a section 924(c) offense. 

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. If that's 

the case, your adversary just said, Mr. Abbott's

1 attorney just said, that you don't believe that section 

2 924(c)(1)(A) is trumped by 924(c)(1)(B) or by 18 U.S.C. 

3 section 930(c). Is his allegation correct or is he 

4 wrong?

 MR. MCLEESE: He is incorrect. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. 

7  MR. MCLEESE: First, with respect to the 

8 internal structure of 924(c), 924(c) as it was amended 

9 in 1998 is a somewhat complex statute. It has a mix of 

sentencing enhancements and elements which create 

11 aggravated versions of the offense, but it is all a 

12 single offense for double jeopardy purposes, for 

13 purposes of what punishment to impose. And, therefore, 

14 the "except" clause operates consistent with the 

definition I just suggested quite sensibly and tells a 

16 district court judge imposing sentence if a defendant 

17 has brandished a firearm and also discharged it, you 

18 pick one of the 924(c) menu items, they are all a single 

19 offense, and you impose a single mandatory minimum 

sentence that is the greatest of those which are 

21 applicable. 

22  Now, with respect to 930(c) -­

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. So that if

2 does he get 10 years, or does he get 20 years? 

3  MR. MCLEESE: He gets 20 years. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How?

 MR. MCLEESE: Because there are -- the 

6 "except" clause says look to your defendant, look to see 

7 which -- whether there is any provision of law which 

8 carries with it a greater mandatory minimum which 

9 punishes the section 924(c) offense. In that instance, 

there are two. One of them provides for a 7-year 

11 mandatory minimum; one of them provides a 20-year 

12 mandatory minimum. The "except" clause -­

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if it was a machine 

14 gun, where there's a 30-year minimum, does he get 40 or 

30? 

16  MR. MCLEESE: He gets 30. You always get -­

17 the "except" clause operates internally to section 

18 924(c) to tell the district court judge, very helpfully 

19 in light of the complexity of the provision: You impose 

one mandatory minimum sentence for each 924(c) 

21 violation, whether aggravated or less aggravated. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's not -- I 

23 can't imagine a single district judge getting that 

24 wrong. To think that, oh, my gosh, here it says 10 

years if you discharge the firearms, and here it says 5

1 years if you have one, which one do I use in a case when 

2 it's discharged? 

3  MR. MCLEESE: That's not -­

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't need this 

provision, the -- your argument can't be that this 

6 language is to make sure the district judge knows in 

7 that case to use the 10-year rather than the 5-year. 

8  MR. MCLEESE: That point, Mr. Chief Justice, 

9 applies in support of our position, because everyone 

agrees that the primary function, the first half of the 

11 "except" clause, does exactly that. That's all it does. 

12 It does nothing else. To the extent -- the "except" 

13 clause says "except to the extent a greater minimum 

14 sentence is provided by this subsection," the only 

function -­

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: But that would include (B). 

17 That would include (B). (B) is part of the same 

18 subsection, isn't it? 

19  MR. MCLEESE: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you know, I -- I think 

21 what the Chief Justice says is very obvious when you are 

22 just talking about (c)(1)(A), but it isn't obvious to me 

23 that if -- if the firearm is discharged and in addition 

24 it's a machine gun or destructive device, that you'd 

only get -- you'd only get the 30 rather than the 30

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: That isn't obvious to me. 

4 And -- and the "except" clause would -- would handle 

that. 

6  MR. MCLEESE: Correct. And it's important 

7 to realize when -­

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I would have 

9 -- I guess things are obvious to different people. I 

would have thought it would be odd to say when there are 

11 increased minimums that the highest minimum applicable 

12 isn't the one that applies. 

13  MR. MCLEESE: I agree with that, but it's 

14 important to realize that another issue that a district 

court judge might confront is whether you should 

16 cumulate them. So it should be, as Justice Sotomayor's 

17 question suggests, that if there are several available, 

18 that you get 20 because it's a machine gun and 10 

19 because it was discharged. And from the perspective of 

busy district court judges, a provision which says, in 

21 figuring out how to sentence a 924(c) offender, you 

22 don't have to look through this complex statute to 

23 figure out what your sentencing enhancements, do some 

24 double jeopardy analysis; all you need to do is simple 

math. You are directed to look to, of all the ones that

1 are available, the one that is longest of the mandatory 

2 minimums. 

3  The point I was trying to make, though, 

4 Mr. Chief Justice, is all of this, the idea that it 

really isn't that critical even to clarify in the first 

6 half of the "except" clause what to do, is consistent 

7 with our position, which is the "except" clause all 

8 together, both internally to section 924(c) and as it 

9 reaches externally, is about clarifying something that, 

it may be true, district court judges otherwise would 

11 have been able to figure out, had they done a lot of 

12 analysis. But it makes it much simpler, and the 

13 practical utility of it is to clarify a sentencing 

14 judge's options with respect to a statute that had been 

made much more complex. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your main -- the 

17 meat of your argument focuses on 3559(c), right? There 

18 is this significant provision out there that does 

19 provide a greater mandatory minimum. And I just don't 

see, as a practical matter, why people would worry about 

21 that. Under 3559(c), you get life. And you're saying, 

22 well, they put in the "except" clause to be sure that 

23 the judge would add another 5 years at the end of a life 

24 sentence.

6  MR. MCLEESE: And I agree, from the 

7 perspective of a defendant, that may not be most 

8 consequential. But this is a provision which, taken as 

9 a whole, was clarifying, not just externally to 924(c), 

but also internally, what district court judges should 

11 do with a complex menu -­

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, just so 

13 I make sure I understand, the basic point you're making 

14 is that there are some things under your reading that 

this deals with. One is the internal point, and we can 

16 disagree as to whether that's necessary or not, and the 

17 other is 3559(c), where it seems to me it doesn't make 

18 any difference whether you're in there for life or life 

19 and the additional 5 years.

 MR. MCLEESE: I agree, it's not practically 

21 significant to a defendant, although sentences of life 

22 plus additional terms or consecutive life are not at all 

23 uncommon in the code. But it is of significance to

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but I'm still trying 

4 to understand your position, which is -- I read what you 

said to me the "except" clause means, and I'm applying 

6 it to 930(c), and I couldn't figure out why you didn't 

7 list it. 

8  MR. MCLEESE: Because 930(c) does not 

9 require an actual killing of a person. It extends to 

conspiracy and attempt. And, therefore, one can violate 

11 930(c) without violating 924(c) and vice versa. And, 

12 therefore -­

14  MR. MCLEESE: By conspiring -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A person who kills any 

16 person -­

17  MR. MCLEESE: -- or by attempting to do so. 

18 So 930(c) has a broader reach because of these vicarious 

19 and inchoate forms of liability. So a defendant could 

be convicted separately of 930(c) and of 924(c). They 

21 are not the same offense for double jeopardy -­

22  JUSTICE BREYER: So there are two possible 

23 readings now of the "except" clause where it says -- the 

24 words are this subsection doesn't apply where a 

mandatory -- where any other provision of law sets forth

1 a higher mandatory. Now, one possible reading, which is 

2 yours, is what this means is that, judge, where you are 

3 operating under that provision you just mentioned, and 

4 you're going to -- the guy has committed two serious 

924(c) things and so he is entitled to life -- this is 

6 just what the Chief Justice said -- this is done to 

7 remind the judge don't give him life plus 25 years, 

8 because it would be 25 years under this statute, not 5. 

9 That's one possible reading.

 The other possible reading is, judge, where, 

11 in fact, you have a pretty -- you have the underlying 

12 drug offense that's going to get you up into the 30s and 

13 it's -- you know, in the guidelines, it's going to be 

14 probably 10, 5 years, or whatever it is. You have a 

pretty high drug offense already. And now we give him 5 

16 extra years, say, for having a gun under this, unless 

17 he's already gotten, say, a mandatory minimum of 7 

18 years. 

19  And if he's already gotten the mandatory 

minimum of 7 years, here's what's happening: Judge, 

21 turn to the guidelines, and the guidelines will tell you 

22 to add 3 or 4 extra years. So in one -- that -- those 

23 are the two possible readings. 

24  Now, the first reading to me makes very 

little sense. The second reading to me says, yes, this

2 has to go to jail for 5, 6, 7, maybe 10 or 20 years for 

3 sure, extra amounts are controlled by the guidelines, 

4 which is administered by a judge.

 Now, if you just came across that for the 

6 first time, which would you think was most probable. 

7  MR. MCLEESE: Well, I think when you place 

8 this in the context of the 1998 amendments that enacted 

9 the "except" clause, it is quite clear that the former 

is more plausible. And the reason I say that, there are 

11 really five features of the 1998 amendments that 

12 illustrate that the "except" clause is not to be read as 

13 eliminating any sentence for a section 924(c) offense, 

14 but rather is clarifying which sentence to impose.

 The first is that the 1998 amendments, 

16 setting aside the "except" clause for a moment, in every 

17 respect substantially increased the scope and severity 

18 of section 924(c). It changed what had been mandatory 

19 sentences to mandatory all the way to life. It -- it 

responded to this Court's decision in Bailey by 

21 increasing the substantive scope of the provision. It 

22 increased the -- it created increased mandatory minimums 

23 for 7-year and 10-year offenses.

1 Congress at the same time ran in the direct opposite 

2 direction and had a substantial rollback of pre-existing 

3 section 924(c) sentencing provisions. And that's -- to 

4 be clear, at the time of the 1998 amendments, these 

Petitioners would have been subject to the mandatory 

6 minimum sentences that they received. They would have 

7 been subject to 10 years in one of the cases for the 

8 drug offense and 5 additional years mandatory and 

9 consecutive under 924(c). For the other, they would 

have -- he would have been subject to 15 years for being 

11 a felon in possession and an armed career criminal and 5 

12 additional under 924(c). 

13  So one of the features that is key is 

14 putting this in the context of the 1998 amendments, 

which were in every respect -­

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, but it -- but it 

17 does -- it does subject them to less, at least with 

18 respect to those -- those enhancements set forth within 

19 the subsection itself.

 MR. MCLEESE: That is true, but that is not 

21 a rollback of pre-existing provisions. It's a way of -­

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? 

23  MR. MCLEESE: Because none of -- in prior 

24 924(c) law, there wasn't a body of law that would have 

given anybody who would get the benefit of the "except"

1 clause under 924(c) a higher sentence. What -- all the 

2 "except" clause does is it makes clear under this more 

3 complicated scheme that when we are increasing these 

4 provisions, a 7 or a 10, you shouldn't telescope them 

all inside 924(c). You shouldn't add them all together; 

6 you pick the highest. 

7  And so it -- the "except" clause is not a 

8 rollback. It is a way of accommodating and giving clear 

9 direction to the complexity of the newly enacted 

provision. And -­

11  JUSTICE BREYER: When -- when did Congress 

12 pass the statute that they amended in 1998? The one 

13 with -- you're saying -- I mean, it's a good point. You 

14 have a point, that this would make it more lenient, the 

interpretation. But the "it" was passed when? 

16  MR. MCLEESE: Well, section 924(c) in its 

17 original form I think was passed in the 1960s. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: So that's way before the 

19 guidelines. So what they are trying to do now is the -­

in 1998, is they're trying to -- see, in 1998 what 

21 they're trying to do is take some of these old 

22 provisions and reconcile them with this new system that 

23 has come along. So I agree you have a point there. 

24  But it -- it does make a certain amount of 

sense, because what it is saying is, in these cases

1 where you have a whoppo mandatory minimum anyway, so 

2 you're sure he's got it; now, the additional amount will 

3 be controlled by the guidelines, which are subject to 

4 not much discretion. They are pretty close to mandatory 

minimums, but there's a little wiggle room. 

6  MR. MCLEESE: On the general approach of 

7 Congress under 924(c), it also bears note that in the 

8 last 25 years Congress has amended section 924(c) six 

9 times, and setting aside for a moment the "except" 

clause, in all of those amendments Congress has 

11 uniformly expanded its scope or increased the severity 

12 of sentences. So the "except" clause would be the sole 

13 provision in which Congress rolled back section 924(c). 

14 And there are several other features of the 1998 

amendment that make clear that that is not what Congress 

16 did. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer 

18 Mr. Ryan's argument that you can read it this way, you 

19 can read it that way; therefore, he wins under the rule 

of lenity? 

21  MR. MCLEESE: Well, this Court's cases make 

22 clear that the rule of lenity comes into play at the end 

23 of the analysis only if there is grievous ambiguity 

24 after all the considerations of statutory construction 

have been considered. We haven't yet discussed all of

1 them, and I think when all of them are discussed, there 

2 is no grievous ambiguity. In fact, the reading that we 

3 suggest is the only reasonable reading, all factors 

4 considered.

 And if I can turn back to a couple of other 

6 features of the 1998 amendments, another feature is 

7 the -- the title of the act itself, which is an Act to 

8 Throttle the Criminal Use of Guns. And, again, it's 

9 just inconsistent with the provision that has these 

features and has that act, that it would be a 

11 substantial important decrease in the mandatory minimum 

12 sentences applicable to a large class of -­

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's a 

14 difficult -- you're saying, because Congress wanted to 

get tough on the people who use firearms in this 

16 provision, every ambiguous clause should be read in a 

17 way that makes it tougher on the criminal defendant? 

18  MR. MCLEESE: I don't -- that would push the 

19 argument too far. I think it is highly relevant to 

construing this -- the statute as a whole, that that was 

21 the clear overall function of that amendment. 

22  Now, there are two other features of the 

23 1998 amendment, which are, it did as has been previously 

24 noted -- also, the only other thing that Congress did in 

the 1998 amendment, other than modifying section 924(c),

1 is it made a corresponding change in section 3559(c) to 

2 -- to correspond. So we know that section 3559(c) was 

3 front and center in Congress's mind as it was enacting 

4 the 1998 amendments. And it is very natural, when 

Congress is creating a more complex statute and giving 

6 district court judges guidance about which mandatory 

7 minimums to select under that statute, to mention and 

8 have language that accommodates the fact that there 

9 is -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, with respect to 

11 3559(c) they were in fact being more lenient, not 

12 stricter, right? 

13  MR. MCLEESE: No, I think they were 

14 clarifying -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you said 

16 earlier that the purpose of this, what it does, is it 

17 makes sure that you don't add 5 extra years on the 

18 people who are sentenced to life. 

19  MR. MCLEESE: I think it clarifies the 

relationship, and, in fact, arguably it could have 

21 clarified the situation in a way that would have been 

22 beneficial to defendants. And the reason I say that is 

23 when Congress enacted the first half of the "except" 

24 clause, which said pick one and only one mandatory 

minimum and impose it -- we're talking internally to

1 section 924(c) -- if it hadn't mentioned 3559(c), there 

2 could have been the idea that if there -- if Congress 

3 didn't direct the same approach with respect to 3559(c), 

4 there's an implication that in fact you should impose 

both. 

6  And so what it really was doing was 

7 clarifying what would have been unclear. And it is, 

8 again, only half of a presumptively narrow provision 

9 which is just clarifying the relationship -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which is right. 

11 You're saying when you get life, or you get 5, just 

12 serve life; don't serve the extra 5. 

13  MR. MCLEESE: Yes. Yes, but it's not saying 

14 that to defendants. It's saying that to busy district 

court judges, who just need to know in a simple, clear 

16 way what am I supposed to -- what sentence am I supposed 

17 to -­

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's the only thing 

19 that that additional language which says "otherwise 

provided by this subsection or by any other provision of 

21 law" -- why didn't they just mention 3559(c)? 

22  MR. MCLEESE: Well -­

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the only thing it 

24 covers, that tiny little thing, which has no effect at

1 you say. I -- I find that quite implausible. 

2  MR. MCLEESE: Well, remember that it was -­

3 although it is not hugely consequential to defendants, 

4 it was a provision that Congress was directly 

considering then. 

6  But there is another function, which is it 

7 creates a default rule for future similar provisions 

8 like 3559(c). And so there -- and had, again -- so it's 

9 not limited to its function with respect to 3559(c); it 

also serves, as Congress often provides, a default rule. 

11  And so, again, there is a fifth feature of 

12 the 1998 amendments for those of whom this is concern, 

13 which is that the legislative history of the provision 

14 strongly corroborates our interpretation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, it's not strongly. The 

16 -- what is it an example? You're saying the other -­

17 this thing also serves the purpose that perhaps someday 

18 Congress will pass a new statute, a totally different 

19 one, and a busy district judge might think that he 

should add the 5 or 25 years from this provision on to 

21 whatever sentence this hypothetical new statute 

22 provides, but this will tell him not to do so. Did you 

23 have anything in mind? 

24  MR. MCLEESE: Well, I -- there are -- there 

are other provisions that, like 924(j), which do provide

Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 sentences for 924(c) offenses that are codified 

2 elsewhere in the code. And with respect to other 

3 offenses, that's also quite common. So there's nothing 

4 implausible about the idea that -­

JUSTICE BREYER: I take it in those other 

6 offenses there are other things in the code, and the odd 

7 thing about this one is there is no other thing in the 

8 code except the one we've been discussing. And so I 

9 just wondered if there -- was there at the time anybody 

thinking of adding some new thing that this might have 

11 been applicable to? Or have you come across anything? 

12 I take it your answer is no. 

13  MR. MCLEESE: I'm not aware that -- that 

14 Congress had some particular pending legislation in 

mind. My point more generally, though, is that it is 

16 quite common for Congress to provide penalties for 

17 offense A in a different section, and so creating a 

18 default rule is a perfectly reasonable thing for 

19 Congress to have done while it was clarifying the 

internal relationships among the various 924(c) 

21 provisions and the provision in 3559(c), which is front 

22 and center in front of it. 

23  With respect to the legislative history, the 

24 "except" clause language was proposed by Senator Jesse 

Helms. In the legislative history of the provision,

which has always been defendants who commit drug 

6 trafficking offenses or violent crimes and who involve a 

7 weapon will get an additional -­

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any 

9 evidence in the legislative history that the reason they 

put this in was to ensure that people who got life would 

11 not get life plus 5 years? 

12  MR. MCLEESE: There's no explicit reference 

13 to that. But that is, I think, a -- a good inference 

14 from the fact that all of the other explanations are far 

more implausible. 

16  And there is something -- there are two 

17 things which support that inference more specifically, 

18 one of which is, again, that Congress did have in front 

19 of it section 3559(c) and was amending it.

 The second is that the sole reference 

21 anywhere in the legislative history to the "except" 

22 clause is in the testimony of a witness at a hearing, 

23 and what that witness said about it was that it will 

24 prevent confusion with other provisions.

 And so there is, I think, a -- a strong

1 indication -­

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's one witness at a 

3 hearing? At a hearing? And you really think that the 

4 rest of the Congress knew about that hearing?

 MR. MCLEESE: I don't. My point is really 

6 more the negative, which is if the "except" clause, in 

7 the second half of an exception that is in its first 

8 part intended to clarify, was instead a major policy 

9 shift from the pre-existing policy of section 924(c), 

additional mandatory consecutive sentences, and instead 

11 a shift over to sentences which we will try to adjust or 

12 ameliorate in light of other -­

13  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. It's a shift 

14 over to the sentencing guidelines, which say a person 

like this one will receive an extra 3 or 4 or 5 years 

16 depending on the circumstances. Will receive it, just 

17 like a mandatory. Unless, of course, it is an unusual 

18 case. That's what it's a shift to. 

19  MR. MCLEESE: Two responses -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Am I wrong? 

21  MR. MCLEESE: Two responses, Justice Breyer, 

22 one of which is that Congress has amended 924(c) both 

23 before and after this provision, and it's clear that 

24 Congress is not shifting away from a mandatory minimum 

regime to a regime that -- where the guidelines are

4 regime, because if this a major policy shift into a

6 statutory construction as well, not just about 

7 guidelines.

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Advisory. 

19  MR. MCLEESE: But -- but the point is that 

Congress -- if Congress was shifting in the "except" 

21 clause, there's a question: What's the nature of that 

22 policy shift? 

23  If you were going to try to reduce 924(c) 

24 sentences to accommodate sentences on other provisions 

of law, instead of just making them an add-on always,

1 then there's a question: What policy should you pick? 

2 Should you pick any other sentence the defendant is 

3 facing at this sentencing? Should you pick any other 

4 sentence arising out of this transaction?

 That's not a guidelines issue. That's a 

6 question of what is the policy reflected by the statute? 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You should pick any 

8 other violent crime or drug trafficking offense that 

9 already provides a higher minimum.

 MR. RYAN: That -­

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it seems to me 

12 the perfectly natural reading is to say, look, we are 

13 providing some minimum sentences when this happens, when 

14 this is the violent crime and you use a gun, but if you 

have already got a higher sentence for the violent 

16 crime, then this doesn't apply. 

17  MR. MCLEESE: That is a possible policy, to 

18 be sure, but one thing -- it's certainly not the only 

19 reasonable policy. You could focus on the transaction 

or you could focus on what the defendant is facing at 

21 the sentencing. All those are among the policy options 

22 you would consider. 

23  And what's interesting is that Petitioners 

24 can't agree among those policy options. And they can't 

agree among those policy options because section 924(c)

section 924(c), which is always impose, for a section 

6 924(c) violator, an additional separate mandatory 

7 minimum sentence. But here is advice about how to do 

8 that. Here is advice about how to do that internal to 

9 section 924(c). Here is advice about how to do that 

external to 924(c) under 3559(c) and with a default rule 

11 for other similar provisions. That's the -- the modest 

12 objective that Congress was attempting to achieve. And 

13 as everyone agrees -­

provisions anywhere in the code? I mean, regardless of

22 this -- in this particular criminal transaction, or only 

23 those in the particular indictment. 

24  Do you escape that necessity?

 MR. MCLEESE: I think we do, and the reason 

50

Official 

1 we do is because, in our view, this provision operates 

2 only when you're talking about prosecution for the same 

3 offense in double jeopardy purposes. And so it's not 

4 possible for -- under our submission, for the Government 

to prosecute somebody for one of these variants of 

6 section 924(c) and then come back again later and 

7 prosecute again and manipulate the overall structure of 

8 sentences, because they are the same offense. 

9  If you move outside that into things that 

are not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes, 

11 then the prospects do open up for irrational patterns of 

12 outcome based on the order in which things are 

13 prosecuted and, in addition, irrational patterns of the 

14 mandatory minimums based on -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how is your reading 

16 different than Mr. Abbott's? 

17  MR. MCLEESE: Mr. Abbott has two readings, 

18 and our reading differs from each of them. The first of 

19 Mr. Abbott's readings is transactional in nature. Ours 

is focused on the section 924(c) offense itself. 

21  The second of our readings is -- the second 

22 of Mr. Abbott's readings is focused on a firearm, just 

23 the fact that a firearm is involved. And, again, ours 

24 is focused on the use of a firearm in a way that 

constitutes the section 924(c) offense. So those are 

51

25

Official 

1 the differences. 

2  But if I could just point out the other 

3 anomalies, there are two other anomalies that we have 

4 not yet touched upon. One of them is that Petitioners' 

submissions create anomalous patterns of floors of 

6 statutory minimums, as we've discussed in the briefs. 

7  If a defendant under Petitioners' 

8 submission, principal submission, has committed a drug 

9 offense that carries a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence 

and brandishes a firearm, it is -- carrying a 7-year 

11 minimum, the floor is 12 years. If that defendant's 

12 drug offense is more aggravated and carries a greater 

13 sentence so that there's a 10-year mandatory minimum, 

14 the overall mandatory minimum, under Petitioners' 

submission, reduces to 10. 

16  And there is the further anomaly that for 

17 offenses that are different, Petitioners' submission is 

18 that the defendant will end up, although adjudicated 

19 guilty of a section 924(c) offense, with no sentence 

whatsoever. There will be a free-floating adjudication 

21 of guilt. And because the defendant, let's say, is a 

22 felon in possession and is sentenced under the Armed 

23 Career Criminal Act, when the judge goes to sentencing, 

24 the judge, on Petitioners' view, says: I will give you 

15 years under the Armed Career Criminal Act; that

1 triggers the "except" clause, and therefore, I impose no 

2 sentence whatsoever under section 924(c). That also is 

3 an anomaly. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As Justice -- as 

Justice Breyer has pointed out, he can take that into 

6 account in figuring out what sentence he would want to 

7 impose beyond the greater minimum. 

8  MR. MCLEESE: That is true. My point about 

9 the anomaly is just that it is very strange, to my 

knowledge unheard of, to have a judge go to sentencing 

11 and have a series of adjudications and to tell the judge 

12 as to one of them it's not the greater or lesser 

13 included offense of another; you don't even need to 

14 impose a sentence on that -- on that adjudication. The 

backdrop basic assumption is, on each of the 

16 adjudications, you impose a sentence. 

17  Now, that's not true if offenses are greater 

18 or lesser or are the same offense, for double jeopardy 

19 purposes. But under Petitioners' submission, that is 

true with respect to offenses like being a felon in 

21 possession of a firearm and being someone who violated 

22 924(c) that are different offenses in double jeopardy 

23 law and have always been given separate judgments, 

24 separate punishments.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. RYAN 

6  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN NO. 09-479 

7  MR. RYAN: I'd like to make two points on 

8 rebuttal. 

9  There has been a great deal of discussion 

about the general purpose of 924(c), but as this Court 

11 has indicated, the best indication of a statute's 

12 purpose is the statute's language, and although the 

13 government argues that the sole purpose of 924(c) was to 

14 enhance punishment for defendants, the "except" clause 

belies that simplistic assertion of the purpose. The 

16 "except" clause actually mediates the punishment that is 

17 provided in 924(c). 

18  The government's reading, at the end of the 

19 day, wants to rely on purpose in order to give no effect 

to the "except" clause. The idea that 3559(c) is an 

21 instruction to busy district court judges, even putting 

22 aside the impossibility of serving an additional 

23 sentence after completing a life sentence, doesn't hold 

24 up, because the government never disputes the fact that 

3559(c) begins with the statement, "Notwithstanding any 

54
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

1 other provision of law." 

2  So the busy district court judge never needs 

3 to turn to the "except" clause in 924(c)(1)(A) to know 

4 that you impose a life sentence when the third strike is 

a 924(c). 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: Whenever Congress uses a 

7 phrase like that, "notwithstanding any other provision 

8 of law," does that mean that Congress must think that 

9 there is some provision of law that falls within that?

 MR. RYAN: Possibly, yes, and that -- here, 

11 the other provision of law would be 924(c), and so the 

12 point would be -­

13  JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't Congress commonly do 

14 that to make sure that something covers any existing 

statute there might be that would fall within that, 

16 without necessarily saying, well, there are two of 

17 them -- if there are two, maybe there are three? Going 

18 through the entire code to find out how many there might 

19 be, or if there is any?

 MR. RYAN: Yes, Justice Alito, and that's 

21 consistent with my point, is that -­

22  JUSTICE ALITO: But it's not consistent with 

23 your main argument about the "except" clause, is it? 

24  MR. RYAN: Well, yes, it is, because the 

"except" clause would also apply to any other provision

1 of law. 

2  JUSTICE ALITO: No, but your argument is the 

3 "except" clause has to have some pretty substantial 

4 effect, or otherwise the "any other provision of law" 

part of it -- otherwise, they wouldn't have put it in. 

6  MR. RYAN: Oh, I apologize. I misunderstood 

7 your -- your question. 

8  The "notwithstanding any other provision of 

9 law," in the context of 924(c), would not have any 

effect if the "except" clause was considered first. But 

11 3559(c) applies to many other triggering offenses, and 

12 so with regards to those -- and the government has not 

13 suggested that 3559(c) has -- has no effect. 

14  The last point I'd like to make is that 

there's no doubt that regardless of one's view about 

16 mandatory minimum sentences as a matter of policy, no 

17 one doubts that Congress has the authority, if it 

18 chooses to exercise it, to stack one mandatory minimum 

19 sentence on top of another.

 But as this Court's cases make clear, 

21 Congress, under the rule of lenity, needs to make that 

22 choice clear. And if nothing else, the government's 

23 shifting views indicate that Congress has not exercised 

24 that choice clearly in this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
