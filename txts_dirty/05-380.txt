 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in case 05-380, Gonzales v. Carhart. 

General Clement.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Congress held six hearings over four 

different Congresses and heard from dozens of witnesses 

in determining that partial-birth abortions are never 

medically necessary, pose health risks, and should be 

banned. Under familiar principles of deference to 

congressional factfinding, those determinations should 

be upheld as long as they represent reasonable 

inferences based on substantial evidence in the 

congressional record.

 That standard is amply satisfied here. The 

evidence before Congress was clear that partial-birth 

abortions were never medically necessary, and that safe 

alternatives were always available such that no woman 

would be prevented from terminating her pregnancy. As a 

result, Congress was entitled to make a judgment in 

furthering its legitimate interests that they were going

to ban a particularly gruesome procedure that blurred 

the line between abortion and infanticide.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, couldn't 

a similar record be made with respect to what is the 

more common procedure, the D&E, that involves 

dismemberment of a fetus inside the womb. So assuming 

you're right that it is constitutional for Congress to 

ban the D&X proceeding, wouldn't the same reasoning 

apply, couldn't Congress make similar findings with 

respect to what is the most common method for second 

trimester abortions?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think so, Justice 

Ginsburg, and I think that this Court's precedence, in 

particular the Danforth case, would stand as an obstacle 

to that piece of legislation, because in Danforth, this 

Court struck down an effort to ban what was then the 

majority method of inducing a second-term abortion.

 And I think in the same way, there is quite 

a different situation when Congress comes in and tries 

to deal with the primary abortion method in the second 

trimester. Here, though, Congress didn't go after the 

dog, so to speak, it went after the tail. This very 

aberrant procedure, atypical procedure. And the numbers 

are hard to come by, but I don't think anybody suggests 

that the D&X procedure is anything more than a very

small minority of second trimester abortions. And so I 

do think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though we are told 

by some of the medical briefs that the procedures are 

basically the same, they start out in the same way and 

that the difference -- the differences are not large in 

particular cases.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, 

let me make a couple of points in response to that. I 

think -- taken at the broader level first, I think there 

is one very important difference between these two 

procedures that led Congress to ban one and allow the 

other to stand. And that is whether fetal demise takes 

place in utero, which is, of course, the hallmark of all 

abortions, or whether fetal demise, the lethal act takes 

place when the fetus is more than halfway out of the 

mother.

 Now, as to their suggestion, I think most 

particularly by Respondents in the second case, that 

there really is no meaningful difference between those 

two procedures. And with respect, I just don't think 

the record supports that. If you look at the record in 

this case, it's very clear in the district court opinion 

that you have some doctors, and examples would be 

Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Creinin, or one of the Nebraska

Plaintiffs, Dr. Vibhakar. They go in, in each and every 

case, and try to perform a dismemberment, or D&E, 

procedure.

 And because they're trying to perform the 

D&E procedure, they need to dilate the cervix only 

modestly. And so Dr. Creinin, for example, his 

testimony is he only dilates the cervix two centimeters 

or two and a half centimeters.

 Now, in contrast, you have other doctors, 

and here the examples I would point to are two of the 

Plaintiff's experts, Dr. Chasen and Dr. Frederickson, 

they, in every single case, set out to perform the D&X 

procedure. And that has material differences. For 

example, the dilation regimen that they use. And so 

Dr. Frederickson, for example, uses multiple sets of 

laminaria to dilate the cervix, and she gets a much 

greater degree of dilation, 5 to 6 centimeters of 

dilation.

 And of course, not only do they set out to 

perform different procedures, but they, in fact, perform 

different procedures. So the evidence here again 

reflects that Dr. Vibhakar, for example, in 100 percent 

of the cases, ends up performing a dismemberment 

procedure, or a D&E procedure. For Dr. Creinin, it's 99 

percent.

Now, by contrast, Dr. Chasen and 

Dr. Frederickson, when they set out to perform a D&X 

procedure, they are successful in their objective less 

often. There are different numbers for different 

doctors, but it seems that, at most, they can achieve 

their objective about a third of the time.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, those doctors 

testified in the congressional hearings or in the Eighth 

Circuit or Ninth Circuit or the Second Circuit? There 

are so many doctors here. Which are the two that you're 

referring to that do not dilate the cervix fully? Did 

they testify in any of the district court cases?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: They did, Justice Kennedy, 

and in particular, Dr. Creinin is an expert. I think 

his deposition was taken, or his testimony was taken 

principally in the California case, but it was 

introduced in all three cases as part of the evidentiary 

record. Dr. Vibhakar is one of the Plaintiffs in this 

particular case. And Dr. Chasen and Dr. Frederickson 

would also -- their testimony was in the record, I 

think, in all three cases.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Just from my going through 

this record, I compare it with Stenhart, with what's in 

Congress. We have two cases here. And it's a fair 

conclusion that there are, in each case, before Congress

and in here, there are some doctors who think this is 

safe and some doctors who think it isn't safe.

 And if you look at the -- sort of by 

counting, by numbers, I guess if you look by lines of 

testimony or by different doctors, interestingly enough, 

it seems to me there are more doctors in these two cases 

and in front of Congress who said it is not safe than 

there were when we considered the other case. And there 

are fewer doctors who say it is safe even with the other 

case. So I don't know if you're supposed to count 

doctors or what.

 My question would be, if this -- do we owe 

more deference to a congressional finding or to Congress 

than we owe to a State legislature? What is -- I mean, 

I take it a State legislature is democratically elected, 

and don't we owe similar deference to both?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, I 

think you certainly owe deference to both. I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if we owe deference 

to both, and I would have thought that we did, then I 

think in the Nebraska case, despite the deference that 

was owed, the Court came to the conclusion that the 

statute of Nebraska was unconstitutional because it 

lacked an exception for the health of the mother, 

something that came from preceding cases. So if giving

deference to Nebraska, we reach that conclusion there, 

and if the deference that is owed is the same, and if 

the evidence is about the same on both sides, how can we 

reach a different conclusion here?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, I 

mean, obviously I'm at a certain deficit to you in 

discussing what this Court held in the Stenberg opinion, 

which you wrote. But my reading of that opinion is that 

this Court did not focus on what was before the Nebraska 

legislature. But this Court focused on what the 

district court found. And in particular, in the 

critical part of the opinion, which would be Section 

2(A) of the opinion, as I read the opinion, what this 

Court did is it confronted Nebraska's argument that the 

D&X procedure was not, in fact, safer.

 And the first thing this Court did is said, 

well, that argument faces quite a burden, because the 

district court made a contrary finding. And then this 

Court in 2(A)(1) of the opinion referenced that finding, 

and four different times cited the district court 

record, and then so on and so forth. It then noted the 

various eight arguments were made by the State in its 

amici to the contrary. And as I read the opinion, it 

basically said the latter, the objections don't 

outweigh the former, the findings.

Now, I think if you compare the record 

before the courts and before Congress, compare that to 

what was before the district court in Stenberg, I think 

there is a much more robust factual record here. If you 

look at the Stenberg case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: General Clement, are not 

some of the findings by Congress clearly erroneous? For 

example, there is a statement that no current medical 

schools provide instruction in the procedure. Now 

that's clearly wrong, isn't it?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean, specifically 

what Congress found in that finding was that none of 

them provided it as part of a curriculum. And I think 

what the record here clearly reflects -- you know, I 

don't know that the idea of a curriculum -- I don't know 

exactly what Congress had in mind. But clearly, is a 

matter of sort of what you teach residents --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think that finding 

is correct?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't know if it's 

correct, based on the curriculum.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing there was a lot 

of evidence introduced in the district court that there 

were schools like Yale and New York University that did 

include this as part of a curriculum, could the district

court disregard that finding and make a contrary 

finding?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think if the evidence in 

the district court were overwhelmingly to the contrary, 

I think that the district court could effectively 

undermine that one finding. I don't think in this case 

anything turned --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, on other findings, 

is there a different standard of review of what the 

district court found as opposed to what Congress found?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, I 

would answer you this way. You might first want to 

isolate those situations where, if the district court 

was addressing something, an issue that just wasn't 

before Congress at all, but it's somehow relevant, and 

makes factual findings, I suppose the district court is 

entitled to the normal kind of deference on review.

 But I think if you have situations, which 

you have in this case, where the district court heard 

some of the same witnesses who testified before Congress 

and before the district court, and the district court 

makes a different credibility finding than the Congress 

made, I don't think that's a basis for the district 

court to be able to overcome the contrary findings of 

Congress.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I don't understand 

Congress to have made credibility findings. As I read 

the -- I read the whole finding. There were six or 

seven pages of findings, and I don't find a single 

reference in those findings to the performance of an 

abortion on a nonviable fetus. All of the language in 

the findings seem to be referring to viable fetuses just 

inches away from becoming a person. And I don't think 

you can even find the word fetus in those findings. The 

findings as opposed to the text of the statute.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Sure, Justice Stevens, I 

think I need to clarify an important point there, which 

is to say, the statute didn't focus on viable versus 

nonviable, because it applies to both sides of the 

viability line.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm talking about the 

findings. Is there a single word in the findings that 

refers to a viable fetus? It maybe refers to a 

nonviable fetus.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think there is, 

Justice Stevens, but I wouldn't find that at all 

remarkable in a statute that applies and bans certain 

procedures without regard to whether the procedure is 

applied to a viable or nonviable fetus and when 

Congress does make specific findings that the procedure

it's banning would have the effect of preventing a 

lethal act on a fetus just inches from being born. It's 

not --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Sure.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's not preventing the 

lethal act, it is requiring that the lethal act be 

performed prior to any part of the delivery, because 

there is no doubt there will be a lethal act. The only 

issue is when it may be performed.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: The issue is whether --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Yes. Because the issue is 

to whether it's going to be performed in utero, or when the 

child is more than halfway outside the womb, and that of 

course --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Whether the fetus is more 

than halfway out, and some of these fetuses I understand 

in the procedure, are only four or five inches long. 

They are very different from fully formed babies.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, again, 

you're right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: When it's halfway out, I 

guess you can call it either a child or a fetus. It's 

sort of half and half isn't it?

GENERAL CLEMENT: I think you could use 

either terminology, Justice Scalia. My point is, 

nothing turns on the terminology. I mean, the 

terminology that Congress chose to use is a living 

fetus. I think the point, though, is that when fetal 

demise is induced in utero, whatever else you think 

about that procedure that is classically an abortion, as 

it has been always understood. But when fetal demise is 

induced when the, when the living fetus is over halfway 

outside of the womb, then I think Congress --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't the fetus be -- I 

think it suffer a demise in seconds anyway.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well it may be seconds, it 

may be hours; it depends on -- because even a pre --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you not agree that it 

has no chance of survival, in most cases?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: If we are talking about 

previability then by definition chances are it won't 

survive.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, that's right.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: But again, I don't think 

that, you know, that anything in this act --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Congress has made the 

judgment that it is far preferable to ensure that fetal 

demise takes place before any delivery begins. That's

the big issue.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I'm not sure if it's 

whether, that's a fair, that's a fair summary. I mean, 

you know, the line isn't that fetal demise has to be 

done before any delivery begins, but the basic point of 

this statute is to draw a bright line between a 

procedure that induces fetal demise in utero and one 

where the lethal act occurs when the child or the fetus, 

whichever you want to call it, is more than halfway 

outside of the mother's womb.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Would it, would it be 

lawful or would it be infanticide to deliver the fetus 

entirely and just let it expire without any attempt to 

keep it alive?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, in the 

postviability context it would clearly be, it would 

clearly be infanticide. I think in the previability 

context, if you have a complete delivery but the child 

isn't going to survive, I don't think it would be 

infanticide to necessarily let the child expire --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. --

GENERAL CLEMENT: But I do think by contrast 

if somebody tried to, with the fetus, you know, 

perfectly alive and in the hours that it might have to 

live, if somebody came in and ripped its head open, I

think we'd call that murder, and in fact Congress passed 

another statute --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Clement, that's 

not what this case is about, because I think you have 

recognized, quite appropriately, that we're not talking 

about whether any fetus will be preserved by this 

legislation. The only question that you are raising is 

whether Congress can ban a certain method of performing 

an abortion. So anything about infanticide, babies, all 

that, is just beside the point because what this bans is 

a method of abortion. It doesn't preserve any fetus 

because you just do it inside the womb instead of 

outside.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Ginsberg, that's 

right, but I don't think that's to trivialize Congress's 

interest in maintaining a bright line between abortion 

and infanticide. And the way I would illustrate it is 

that line, even if you might think it has a temporal 

line, in the sense that viability versus previability is 

relevant, it clearly has a spatial dimension as well and 

the best illustration of that I think is think about a 

lawful postviability abortion. There is a problem with 

the mother's health, there is a problem with her life so 

it's a lawful postviability abortion. I don't think 

anybody thinks that the law is or should be

indifferent to whether in that case fetal demise takes 

place in utero or outside the mother's womb. The one is 

abortion, the other is murder.

 And I think that just recognizes that even 

in the postviability context you have a very important 

line which is a spatial line, and that line is basically 

in womb, outside of womb, and what Congress tried to do 

in this statute is to draw that line and differentiate 

between one procedure where fetal demise takes place in 

utero --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if this case were 

limited to postviability abortions it would be a 

different matter. But isn't it so that the vast 

majority of these abortions are going to be performed 

previability?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think that's probably 

right, Justice Ginsburg, but I think the point I would 

make is that Congress has an interest in maintaining the 

spatial line between infanticide and abortion, even with 

respect to previability fetuses and that's true for at 

least two reasons.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If -- I see what you're 

driving at in terms of the procedure. We are focusing 

on a universe where the fetus is not going to survive no 

matter what, right?

agrees that if method B, which they don't want, were to 

be necessary for the safety or health of the mother, the 

Constitution would require it being done. I didn't see 

anything here about Congress disagreeing with that.

that, we don't think it's ever necessary for the health 

or safety of the mother. That's where we are. Now as I 

look at the record, I see many, many, many doctors 

telling Congress and everybody else that it is 

necessary, and safe. And I see other doctors telling 

Congress primarily, but in court, too, that it isn't 

necessary, ever for safety.

 And so if medical opinion is divided, and 

I'm not advocating what I'm about to say, I just want to 

know your reaction. If medical opinion is divided, why 

wouldn't it be up to this Court or could this Court say 

this use of this procedure, we enjoin the statute to 

permit its use but only where appropriate medical 

opinion finds it necessary for the safety or health of 

the mother?

 Now, if Congress is right, there will be no 

such case so it's no problem. But if Congress is wrong, 

then the doctor will be able to perform the procedure 

and Congress couldn't object to that because the 

Congress isn't worried about, I mean Congress, then 

Congress was wrong. They agreed that we had a health or 

safety exception.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice 

Breyer, here is the problem with that way of approaching 

the statute. That might be a permissible way of

approaching it if what the evidence on the other side 

was, that well you know there are cause-specific reasons 

why you need this procedure. There are particular 

conditions where you need this procedure. But that's 

not the evidence on the other side. What their doctors 

say, the doctors who perform this D&X procedure, the 

Dr. Chasens, the Dr. Fredericksons, what they will tell 

you is that every single case the D&X procedure is 

better and safer and they want to do it. And so it 

doesn't make, I mean Congress can't pass a statute that 

bans procedure A, and that ban doesn't apply any time a 

doctor prefers procedure A.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No. It just wouldn't be a 

question of the doctor's preference. You would have to 

refer back to prior cases, and what the prior cases talk 

about including Stenberg is not that that the doctor 

simply has a preference, but rather that there has to be 

a significant body of medical opinion that says that 

this is safer procedure and necessary for the safety of 

the mother.

 Now, where that's true, the Court has 

previously said that the Constitution protects the 

right. And I don't see anything in what Congress says 

that wants to change that law. They simply have a 

different view of the facts.

JUSTICE BREYER: So if they have a different 

view of the facts, why can't we leave it up to whatever 

facts develop? If there is an appropriate body of 

medical opinion that does in fact believe this is 

necessary for the health of the mother, so be it, and 

the abortion could be performed and the injunction would 

say that.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: And otherwise not.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: If this Court rejects the 

facial challenge to this statute it is still going to be 

open for litigants in the future to try to identify 

specific conditions where this procedure is the safer 

alternative.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me a 

hypothetical instance in which where an as applied 

challenge could be brought if we sustain the statutue 

on its face? The procedure has to take place within 24, 

48, 72 hours. How would as applied challenge take place? 

You know, I read all the doctors' testimony 

in this case, hundreds of pages, and I'm familiar with 

the area generally. But it takes a while to get up to

speed. I don't know if you could just go to a district 

judge and say I need an order, the judge would take --

would have to take many hours to understand that.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Kennedy, what I 

think I have in mind principally would be a 

preenforcement challenge that was an as applied 

challenge. And what I have in mind, you know that's 

something that there is in other areas of the law, 

Steffl against Thompson is an example. But what you 

would have in mind is a doctor who had standing under 

this Court's abortion jurisprudence would come in and 

say, look, in my practice I've seen that this procedure 

would be particularly useful in dealing with 

preeclampsia or placental previa or some condition.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why isn't that already in 

the record in the Ninth Circuit, in the Second Circuit 

and in the Eighth Circuit, in the district courts, 

proceedings in those circuits?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, there is an effort 

to make that showing. I don't think that it's been a 

successful effort to make that showing. In fact I think 

if you look at the findings of the district courts in 

these cases, two of the three district courts found that 

there was no particular condition where the D&X abortion 

was medically necessary or had marginal safe benefits --

safety benefits. In this case, the Nebraska case, the 

district court identified only two conditions, 

preeclampsia combined with maternal cancer, and placenta 

previa. And as to those particular findings as we point 

out in our reply brief, there are problems with each of 

those findings.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: General Clement, I'm just 

thinking, trying to imagine how an as applied challenge 

would be really much different from what we have seen 

already.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think, I 

mean, they've challenged everything including every 

application of the statute and they've tried to pick off 

some particular conditions. What I'm imagining is in 

the future you might have, you might have additional 

evidence, you might have additional experience with 

doctors, and they might come in and target their 

challenge to particular conditions and try to say --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But General -- General 

Clement, conditions don't show up in the abstract. 

Wouldn't it often be the case that it depends on the 

vulnerability of the particular patient and you couldn't 

bring a preenforcement challenge as to that. Maybe 

it's a question of hemorrhaging, that -- it's a 

combination of what the condition is and the

vulnerability of the particular patient and I don't see 

how that could be tested in advance.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg my 

understanding is even when you talk about an 

idiosyncratic condition, I mean, the doctors who perform 

these abortions perform, you know, hundreds of them a 

year and they can identify those conditions and they 

have names for those conditions and I think it would be 

amenable to bringing a more as applied challenge.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: General, do you 

understand the scope of this statute to be different 

than the scope of the statute at issue in Stenberg, 

focusing in particular on the deliberate and intentional 

language?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I certainly do, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and I think that this statute, unlike the 

Nebraska statute, clearly uses an anatomical landmark 

approach that is based in the text of the statute and 

clearly distinguishes between the D&E procedure on the 

one hand and the D&X on the other hand.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't it quite 

independent of the anatomical approach that the health 

exception is denied? I mean that's an -- that does not 

depend on the anatomical approach. The anatomical 

approach may well be an answer at the facial

challenge stage, to problems of vagueness, for example. 

But the health excepton problem is not affected by that. 

And the difficulty that I have with your argument that 

somehow the health exception issue should be left to an 

as applied challenge is the statement in Stenberg, and 

it's on 938.

 I'm quoting: "But where substantial medical 

authority supports the proposition that banning a 

particular abortion procedure could endanger women's 

health, Casey requires the statute to include a health 

exception where the procedure is necessary in 

appropriate medical judgment for the preservation --" 

-- excuse me -- "of the life or health of the mother."

 Now, your position, it seems to me, requires 

us to do one of three things. Either we, we overrule 

Stenberg in that respect, or we, we find -- I don't know 

how but we might find, well, in this case, there is no 

substantial medical authority, and therefore on the face 

of the statute there seems to be no impediment in the 

Stenberg statement. Or three, we say well, there seems 

to be a tension between the showing of substantial 

medical authority which occurred in the litigation in 

these cases and the findings made by Congress, and under 

those circumstances in effect we are required to ignore 

the record in the cases and go with Congress's

apparently contrary judgment.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, we would urge you to

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Take all three.

 (Laughter.)

 JUDGE SOUTER: No, but seriously --

GENERAL CLEMENT: But in fairness, I mean, 

you know, we have an obligation to defend the statute. 

So our first, you know, our first effort would be to say 

we distinguish the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but the problem, I 

guess -- focus the problem this way. The, the Stenberg 

opinion talks about substantial medical authority as 

triggering this requirement for a statutory element. 

That problem is not focused simply by saying Congress 

made some findings and the district court made other 

findings and Congress should prevail.

 The fact is the substantial medical judgment 

finding I would suppose is satisfied by the, by the 

record in the district courts in these cases. This is 

not one doctor's idiosyncratic judgment and a court can 

reasonably find, it seems to me, that there is 

substantial medical judgment. If we are going to defer, 

as you say we should defer to Congress, haven't we got

to overrule that statement?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think so, Justice 

Souter. Let me just -- I'd like to save some time for 

rebuttal, but let me try to answer it this way, which is 

our way of looking at Stenberg is Stenberg really 

doesn't address what you do when there are congressional 

findings. And there is some tension between Stenberg 

and Turner on this, because Stenberg seems to suggest, 

well, when there is a doubt, the kind of doubt that 

would normally get you past a summary judgment, you 

defer to the doctors, and Turner seems to suggest when 

you have a doubt, conflicting evidence, the kind of 

doubt that might get you past summary judgment normally, 

you defer to Congress. And it has to be one or the 

other. It can't go both ways, can't go opposite ways, 

and we would say resolve that tension, but when there is 

congressional findings, something that you obviously 

didn't have to confront in Stenberg, defer to the 

congressional approach.

 If Stenberg means something contrary, that 

even in the face of congressional findings that you have 

to defer to a minority opinion of doctors and, you know, 

kind of invert what would normally be the way of 

approaching it, we think then that would be inconsistent 

with this Court's decision in Casey, among others, and

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRISCILLA SMITH

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MS. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 The Government throughout this case has 

quarreled with the plaintiff's statement of Stenberg and 

Congress quarreled clearly with the district court 

findings, but their real argument here is with this 

Court in the Court's ruling in Stenberg, particularly in 

light of the congressional findings that are, that are 

frankly unsupported by either the congressional record 

or the additional evidence presented to the district 

courts. The only course here that preserves the 

independence of the judiciary, that exemplifies the 

importance of stare decisis, not to mention the only 

course that will protect women from needless risks of 

uterine perforation, infertility, sepsis and hemorrhage, 

is to hold this act unconstitutional.

didn't find it in the materials. Maybe the statistics

aren't available. In the cases where intact D&E or D&X 

are performed in the period I guess, what, 16 through 

20, 21st, 22nd weeks, in how many of those instances, do 

you have any idea, in how many of those instances is 

there serious health risk to the mother that requires 

the procedure as opposed to simply being an elective 

procedure? Are there any statistics on that?

 MS. SMITH: No. In terms of the underlying 

medical conditions there really aren't, Your Honor, and 

it varies dramatically according to the practice of the 

physician. If a physician is in a high risk OBGYN 

practice, he or she is much more likely to encounter 

patients with serious underlying medical conditions such 

as the ones that the doctors have testified about in 

this case, the liver disease, kidney disease, heart, 

cardiovascular disease, cancer of the placenta, bleeding 

placenta previa, all of these issues and underlying 

conditions that makes the impact and the risks that are 

reduced by the intact D&E particularly important.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have no evidence 

either in the record before the Court or Congress as to 

how often that situation arises?

 MS. SMITH: No, we don't, Your Honor. We 

know that in some practices it's quite frequent, in some 

practices it's not as frequent because those are mostly

hospital-based practices. But on the other hand, 

there's extensive evidence in this case, much more 

evidence frankly, Your Honor, Justice Breyer, than there 

was in the Stenberg case, of the, of the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have just one other 

question that, it's generally related to the first. 

If there is substantial evidence that other procedures 

or alternate procedures are available, alternate to D&X, 

alternate to intact D&E, is your response that, although 

they're available as a matter of science, as a matter of, 

of medical expertise, they are not available because 

hospitals don't allow the patients to be admitted? I 

was going to ask that same question to the Government, 

because there is some indication in the record that 

certain hospitals just don't admit patients for this 

purpose, which is -- goes back to my earlier question. 

I was wondering if that's because it's surely elective.

 MS. SMITH: Because it's what sir?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it's purely 

elective and not medically necessary.

 MS. SMITH: No, Your Honor. Hospitals, 

many, many hospitals throughout the United States refuse 

to provide any abortions whatsoever as just a blanket 

rule. There are some that will provide abortions in 

certain, in certain circumstances where the woman is

obtaining the abortion because of a certain medical 

condition. Then there are women who are obtaining an 

abortion because they have chosen that that's the best 

course for them who also have underlying medical 

conditions. So if you're a woman who has chosen to 

obtain an abortion and you have an underlying cardiac 

disease, for example -- we had a case like this in 

Louisiana. The hospital refused to do the abortion 

because her chance of dying from the underlying medical 

condition was not over 50 percent. So the availability 

of hospital services is somewhat unrelated to this case, 

but it is, it is quite limited in some circumstances.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it might be related 

in the sense that the Government's argument that there 

are alternate mechanisms is not a practical alternative. 

I was going to ask the Government about that. On the 

other hand, the fact that any number of hospitals don't 

allow the procedure is also indicated, indication that 

there is a medical opinion against it.

 MS. SMITH: No, not at all, Your Honor. The 

medical opinion in those cases is against abortion 

whatsoever and a refusal to use one's facilities to 

provide any abortion --

 JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't like your 

characterization and the Government's of the state of 

the record. I asked my law clerk basically to go look 

up every statement that was made in four forums. The 

first was the first Stenberg case. Second was Congress. 

Third is this, one of the cases here; and the fourth is 

the other case here. Now, my own impression of that is 

if you're talking about the medical need for such a 

case, that is for intact D&E, that there is a risk 

attached if you don't use it in some instances. The 

fewest number of statements for that proposition was in 

the first Stenberg.

 MS. SMITH: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: More statements in 

Congress, more statements that you -- doctors who say, I 

need this procedure for safety.

 MS. SMITH: There are many more in this --

JUSTICE BREYER: There are many more in this 

case than there were -- in these two cases there are 

many more than there were in Congress and in Congress 

there are many more than they were in first Stenberg.

other side of the coin, the doctors who say, no, it

there are some in these cases, too; and there are hardly 

any in Stenberg, not too many.

to Congress that are in the record. In terms of live 

witnesses, Your Honor --

 MS. SMITH: -- there were in Congress eight 

live witnesses that testified.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, so I'm left with 

a record where I guess you have a subjective 

characterization that there is at least as much evidence 

in these cases supporting you and as much in Congress 

supporting you as there was in the first Stenberg case. 

But Congress made this finding, so what am I to do with 

the finding?

 MS. SMITH: Right. Well, the important 

point, Your Honor, is that even if the Court applied the 

highest level of deference under Turner, the findings

statement of the American College of Obstetricians and 

Gynecologists before Congress?

 MS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, it was, as was 

the brief that was filed, the amicus brief that was 

filed in this case in Stenberg was before Congress, and 

also testimony from numerous physicians in the form of 

letter. In terms of live witnesses, there were simply 

not that many.

extra 30 seconds. Proceed.

lost track of my train of thought, though, I think.

 I think what I was saying was there were 

eight witnesses who testified live.

that I agreed with you in that there is more evidence 

supporting your side in these cases than there was

Nebraska legislature, and so does that fact of the 

finding being in Congress and not in the Nebraska 

legislature -- what kind of legal difference does that 

make?

 MS. SMITH: And Your Honor, what I would say 

in this case, it makes none. While it's an extremely 

interesting academic question about the level of 

deference that should be applied in this kind of 

circumstance, here it really is academic because under, 

even under the Turner standard, if applied in a way that 

Turner actually applied deference, to carefully review 

the findings in light of the evidence in Congress and 

again in light of the evidence in the district court --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this 

question about what you think we should do. If I 

thought the evidence did support the conclusion that 

it's never medically necessary, it merely -- the 

evidence merely supports the proposition that a doctor 

has to be a lot more careful if he goes one way rather 

than the other because there are more risks involved in 

one procedure rather than the other, would that be 

sufficient to support the -- I can see the argument that 

the intact delivery may have less risk of complications 

and so forth without it not necessarily being absolutely

necessary.

 MS. SMITH: Well, I think there is, there's 

been some confusion about the word "necessary" and it's 

been used sometimes to talk about whether there are 

other procedures that could be used, as opposed to the 

determination that it is the safest procedure that 

reduces significantly the risk of very serious 

complications, not the risks of minor complications.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess that gets 

back to the point earlier. I mean, do you agree with 

the discussion earlier that this act is not going to 

prevent abortions?

 MS. SMITH: No, not at all, Your Honor. I 

-- the issue of the scope and breadth of the law is -- I 

think the evidence clearly shows that this is a very 

broad law that applies to D&E abortions and, contrary to 

what the Solicitor General said about the intent of 

abortions, abortion providers like Dr. Vibhakar and 

others, they actually, their intent is always to remove 

the fetus as intact as possible, and the district courts 

have recognized that as an intent that's covered under 

the terms of the act.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What degree of 

marginal impact on safety do you think is necessary to 

override the State's interest? I mean, if you have

complications under the D&E procedure in say 10 percent 

of the cases, complications under D&X in 9.99 percent of 

the cases, is that marginal benefit in safety enough to 

override the State's articulated interest?

 MS. SMITH: I don't believe a marginal 

benefit in safety is enough and I don't believe that's 

what we have here. The testimony from over, from at 

least 11 board-certified OBGYNs, from the American 

College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, is that the 

reduction in risk is significant and that it reduces the 

risk of serious complications, such as uterine 

perforation, which can lead to hysterectomy and 

infertility.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought your 

submission earlier was that we don't have any record 

evidence about how often the complications arise, so 

it's hard to get a handle on exactly what the difference 

is in terms of safety under your submission.

 MS. SMITH: We don't have a quantification 

of the safety. What we what we have is the clinical 

experience of major leading physicians in the field, 

who've testified that they've used both procedures. In 

fact, many of them have testified that they perforated 

uteruses in non-intact D&Es and they've never perforated 

a uterus in an intact D&E. And that in fact is borne

out by the Chasen study, a very small study with very 

small numbers, but it shows all the serious 

complications are in the non-intact group.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If we could go back to 

the first question that the Chief asked you, you said 

yes, it will prevent abortions because of this uncertain 

line between the D&X and the D&E. Is there a way that 

Congress could have written the statute that would have 

insulated the physician who's performing a D&E?

 MS. SMITH: Absolutely, Your Honor. I think 

that the blueprint that this Court laid out, that 

certainly is suggested in Justice O'Connor's concurrence 

in Stenberg, was rejected by Congress. She references 

three statutes, that if they had included a health 

exception, she thinks would have been constitutional. 

They all include the word intact.

 I think there's another narrower 

construction of the act too that is possible. Adding in 

the word intact, reading in the word intact, it seems to 

me, is not a reasonable interpretation of the statute as 

it is, but certainly Congress could have done that and 

other States have done it, but Congress set out not to 

do that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I ask you to focus on 

one particular problem that I think is implicated by

Justice Ginsburg's question. If I understood you 

correctly a moment ago, and I think this is in your 

briefs too, you said that the definitional problem is 

that doctors always set out to do an intact procedure if 

they can, because it involves less risk to the mother 

from, from acts performed inside. And if that's the 

case, then it would be, I guess in the real world, very 

difficult for Congress to define a difference between 

D&E and D&X, because the intention is always, as you 

understand it, to have an intact result.

 Your brother on the other side, the 

Solicitor General says there certainly is testimony to 

the effect that that is not so. That doctors who intend 

to perform a D&E simply intend at the beginning to have 

a lesser degree of dilation which will force them to do 

the D&E and not have a totally intact procedure.

 Would you comment on what I think is the 

factual difference between you and the Solicitor General 

there?

 MS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the 

problem with the law is that because it's not limited to 

intact, it would in fact cover the procedures that are 

performed by physicians who intend to perform a 

procedure as intact as possible but simply don't expect 

that.

 MS. SMITH: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But could you start simply 

with the factual predicate for your argument and his 

argument. You seem to be starting from, if I understand 

the two of you correctly, you seem to be starting from 

basically different factual assumptions. Could you, 

could you start by commenting on that?

 MS. SMITH: Yes. The doctors perform the 

same dilation protocols whether they are going to 

perform a D&E or an intact D&E, and that's true for 

Dr. Chasen and Dr. Westhoff, who performed both intact 

and non-intact procedures.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the 

evidence was that you're looking for a different degree 

of dilation if you're intending to perform D&E than if 

-- and you're looking for a greater degree if you're 

intending to perform a D&X.

 MS. SMITH: It doesn't play out that way. 

Doctors do have different dilation protocols, but they 

are often looking for as much dilation as they can get. 

On the other hand --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your submission 

that there aren't different dilation protocols if you're 

intending a D&E and if you're intending a D&X, they're

the same?

 MS. SMITH: It varies by doctor. For 

example, Dr. Carhart uses the same dilation protocol 

whether he's going to do an intact or a non-intact. 

Other doctors might try to do more dilation. And the 

doctors, importantly, can't control the amount of 

dilation they get, so a decision happens.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they may not be able 

to control it in an absolute sense, but can't they go 

about it in a way that would tend to produce less rather 

than more dilation?

 MS. SMITH: Not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It can't guarantee results, 

but couldn't they at least start with a, I don't know 

how you put it, a procedure that would be likely to 

produce less rather than more, and hence come within the 

safe harbor, if you will, of the statute?

 MS. SMITH: Well, they are always looking 

for a minimal amount of dilation. Then people who chose 

to do another day of dilation, for example, that could 

add additional dilation. But for the first day of 

dilation, no, Your Honor. They don't seek more or less 

over one day. They might do a second day or --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say they don't, 

but my question is, can they? And the record may not

but do we have evidence that would indicate that they 

can or that they can't?

 MS. SMITH: Not in the first day of 

dilation, no. They can't control how much dilation is 

going to occur. They need a minimal amount and they are 

not going to shoot for less than that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Can you tell us where to 

look in the record for the evidence on that?

 MS. SMITH: Each doctor testifies about 

their own dilation protocols, Your Honor, and I believe 

that's in the Eighth Circuit appendix. Those -- those 

-- portions of that testimony, and are cited more 

specifically in the Eighth Circuit briefs, which goes 

more into the factual detail, Your Honor, but I don't 

have the cites right now. I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If there were a health 

exception --

MS. SMITH: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The health of the woman, 

would that obviate the vagueness and overbreadth 

problems that you bring up? Because then after we say 

to the doctor, you put the health of your patients first 

and if you think that it's riskier for her health to do 

it one way than another way, then you pick the safer way.

If you had that, then wouldn't the concerns about 

overbreadth fade?

 MS. SMITH: Not if this is not limited to 

intact, Your Honor, because then you would be limiting 

D&E abortions, which is 95 percent of all abortions, to 

circumstances where the doctor could prove that it was 

in fact the safest procedure. And we've had doctors 

testify in trial, for example, that they refused to 

describe even intact -- regular D&Es to their patients 

because they believe induction is always safer. So 

those doctors, I think would still be at risk, and it 

would put 95 percent of second trimester abortions at 

risk in that case, to prosecution for performing a D&E 

when you should have been performing an induction 

procedure.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think the, on 

the same issue I think, that the addition of the 

deliberately and intentionally language in the 

congressional act addresses that concern?

 MS. SMITH: No, Your Honor, because actually 

that same language is in the Stenberg, the Nebraska 

statute. It also was targeted at deliberately 

intentionally. I do think that if there is a 

construction that would narrow the law to a limited 

amount of intact D&Es, if you read the "for the purpose

of" language in the statute, to be performing an overt 

act for the sole purpose of completing delivery, then --

or rather -- I'm sorry. For the purpose of performing 

an overt act that causes fetal demise, that does not 

facilitate delivery of the statute -- of the fetus.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's what I was 

wondering, because --

MS. SMITH: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose, this might help, 

suppose the physician testifies that I wanted to do a 

non-intact, an in utero D&E, that that's, that was my 

intent, that's what I wanted to do, that's what I always 

want to do. In this case I had an intact delivery and 

had no other choice. Are you saying that we could 

interpret the statute to say that that is not the 

prohibited criminal intent, he is immune from 

prosecution in that case?

 MS. SMITH: No. I don't believe that's the 

line that could be drawn, Your Honor, because anyone who 

does a D&E is intending to remove the fetus as intact as 

possible, and always can have the intent to go to the 

anatomical landmark that's here. I'm suggesting a 

different interpretation that uses the "for the purpose 

of" language where it says for the purpose of performing 

an overt act that the person knows will kill the

partially delivered living fetus. If that language was 

interpreted to be for the sole purpose of performing 

fetal demise at that point, rather than what the doctors 

do, which is perform the action that causes fetal demise 

in order to facilitate delivery of the fetus. So if 

it's not to facilitate delivery of the fetus --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, give me one instance 

in which your proposed interpretation would work in the 

real world.

 MS. SMITH: Well, there are allegations in 

the Congressional Record, for example, in reference --

in Justice Thomas' dissent by Nurse Schaffer, Dr. Pamela 

Smith, about circumstances where the physician actually 

holds the fetus in the woman's body in order to cause 

fetal demise, rather than causing fetal demise because 

it's an integral part of removal of the fetus from the 

woman's uterus. And those circumstances would be banned 

under that interpretation.

 But I want to get back to the Turner point, 

if I may for a minute, the issue of deference to 

congressional finding.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just on that last 

point, I mean, we are interested of course in different 

interpretations, but it just seems to me that your 

interpretation would have very little practical effect.

MS. SMITH: Well, it would -- it would ban 

certainly a certain type of intact procedure that was 

discussed, and I think is the image many people have of 

"partial-birth abortion" frankly, that this is something 

that's done gratuitously, not as an integral part of 

making this procedure the safest for the woman, and 

avoiding instrumentation and avoiding perforation and 

hysterectomies, which are serious complications that 

though rare, when they occur, they are catastrophic and 

life changing and disastrous. So the numbers are not 

high of any complications, but the complications when 

they occur are, are devastating. And this is what the 

doctors are experiencing when they perform intact D&Es, 

that they are not having these types of complications.

 So -- if I can move to the deference point, 

I would like to talk a little bit about deference to 

congressional findings because there is significant 

authority from this Court of course, saying that where 

there are danger signs of constitutional risks, as the 

Court recently said in Randall versus Sorrell, that the 

Court must independently and carefully review 

congressional findings. And the Court has rejected 

findings that attempted to change either by findings of 

fact or legal findings, that attempted to change a 

constitutional standard.

But in any case, the findings in this case 

are simply unreasonable and not supported by the 

evidence. If you go to the findings themselves, the 

ultimate finding in 14o, which claims that it is 

actually relying on the preceding findings, it says, 

"for these reasons, Congress finds that partial birth 

abortion is never medically indicated," and then you go 

backwards and look at the reasons. The reasons are the 

findings that are not defended by the Government, that 

were not defended by the Government witnesses and that 

are blatantly false, except for perhaps one of them.

 There are findings of, that partial-birth 

abortion poses serious risks. The Government witnesses 

agreed that this was not true.

 Their findings that partial-birth abortion 

is not taught in medical schools. Of course, we know 

that is simply not true, it's an integral part of 

abortion training at major medical institutions like 

Cornell, Columbia, Yale, NYU, Northwestern, etc.

 It says that abortion, partial-birth 

abortion is a disfavored practice among abortion 

providers. That is absolutely not true.

 And it says that there are no comparative 

studies. We know now that is not true because the

kind to try to evaluate the differences between intact 

and non-intact. It is still true that there are no 

controlled studies, there is no randomized clinical 

trial, but if that were the standard, no new and safer 

abortion procedures could ever be developed.

 Turning back, Your Honors, to the health issue.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I ask you just 

one thing?

 MS. SMITH: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The statute, of 

course, refers to both feet first and vertex deliveries. 

How common is the vertex delivery in the D&X?

 MS. SMITH: Not very common. Not very 

common, Your Honor. It would occur in circumstances 

where there is a significant fetal anomaly and some kind 

of a, something called a sides, or another type of fetal 

anomaly where there is a distension of the abdomen, but 

it's very rare.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And in giving your 

arguments toward the safety benefits of the D&X, I 

couldn't understand why they wouldn't also apply to the 

total delivery of the fetus in a vertex delivery 

situation.

 MS. SMITH: I'm sorry. I don't know if I 

understand.

the feet first is that you want fewer instrument 

passes and so on.

 MS. SMITH: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in that case, 

it's not the skull itself that is preventing the 

delivery of the fetus.

 MS. SMITH: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your arguments 

about why the D&X is safer than feet first, wouldn't 

that apply in the case of total delivery of the fetus as 

well? In other words, if you want as much of the fetus 

intact and out as possible, why wait, stop it halfway? 

Wouldn't the safety argument suggest delivery of the 

fetus?

 MS. SMITH: Yes, but these are circumstances 

where the fetus can't be delivered. That's the point, 

Your Honor, is that the fetus is obstructed and so the 

overt act that takes place is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the case of a 

vertex delivery, where is the obstruction?

anomaly. It's lethal anomalies that I was talking 

about. And in those circumstances, an overt act would 

need to be performed that would in fact cause fetal 

demise before the fetus could be, the delivery could be 

continued.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that your 

argument is that there is always a constitutional right 

to use what the physician thinks is the safest 

procedure.

 MS. SMITH: No, Your Honor. I think the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I inferred that from your 

comments.

 MS. SMITH: I don't think so, Your Honor. 

What, what the Court held in Stenberg in applying the 

appropriate medical judgment standard of Casey, was that 

there had to be a substantial body of medical opinion, 

an objective standard that in fact supports the use of 

that procedure. And that both, that balances concerns 

against protecting a woman's health with a concern of 

unfettered discretion, which the Court has rejected.

proposition I put at first, it must be true that there 

are some instances in which the State can prohibit a

as it doesn't pose an undue burden on the woman, which

ruling.

MS. SMITH: No.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- pose an undue 

burden. And I was just following up to say that so, in 

some circumstances, prohibiting what you regard is the 

safest procedure does not itself constitute an undue 

burden.

 MS. SMITH: No. I understood Justice 

Kennedy's question to be, could the State prohibit what 

it thinks is not the safest. And under the Stenberg 

ruling, although the Court hasn't addressed that 

question directly, under Stenberg what the Court has 

said is, the Court can ban procedures only where there 

is not significant medical authority supporting their 

use as the safest procedure in some circumstances. So 

perhaps I misunderstood your question.

 But the Court has not ever addressed the 

question, can we ban a procedure that's not the safest. 

I think the ruling in Stenberg would say well, there has 

to be significant medical authority that in some 

circumstances it is the safest. The alternative 

argument would be, but, if it is the procedure that's 

used in 95 percent of the cases, or a vast majority of 

the cases, and banning it would thereby deny women the 

right to get an abortion and be a substantial obstacle

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Let me make just a couple of points in rebuttal.

 I'd like to start with Justice Kennedy's 

question, about whether or not there are going to be 

alternative methods available to end the pregnancy as a 

practical matter. And the answer to that is there will 

always be an alternative available as a practical matter. 

The alternative will always be the D&E procedure, which 

the district court in this case called the gold standard. 

And the best evidence of that, Justice Kennedy, is that 

their own witnesses like Dr. Chasen, for example, when 

they set out to perform the D&X procedure, they are only 

successful about 33 percent of the time. What happens 

in the other 67 percent of the cases is they actually, 

even though they tried to perform a D&X, will perform a 

D&E. And so all of the clinics that provide D&X also

necessarily provide D&E, because the D&E is what they 

end up with if they are not able to remove the fetus 

intact. So in every single case, there are some, you 

know, the induction procedure has to be done in a 

hospital, but the D&X and D&E procedures are both 

equally available in clinics, so no woman as either a 

theoretical matter or a practical matter, is going to be 

denied a safe alternative to end her pregnancy.

 I wanted to pick up on Justice Souter's 

question as well. You asked for factual citations in 

the record on this dispute between us. I think the 

record is really overwhelmingly in our favor. I point 

you to Dr. Fitzhugh, who's one of the plaintiffs on this 

side, 135a. He says he doesn't try for intact delivery 

in every case because it would necessitate a second 

round of dilation, a second round of laminarias, so he 

doesn't do the second round, he gets dismemberment. 

Dr. Knorr, another one of the plaintiffs, at page 142a, 

he says the procedure would require greater dilation.

 And if I could just finish on the citations, 

Dr. Vibhakar, who does dismemberment 100 percent of the 

time, 148a -- all of these are in the petition appendix
