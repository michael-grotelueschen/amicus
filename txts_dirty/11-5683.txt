 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

this morning in Case 11-5683, Dorsey v. United States, 

and 11-5721, Hill v. United States.

 Mr. Eberhardt.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN E. EBERHARDT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. EBERHARDT: Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court:

 The judges of the Seventh Circuit are 

unanimous in their belief that this case raises a good 

question. And, of course, that good question is: Why 

would Congress want district courts to continue to 

impose sentences that were universally viewed as unfair 

and racially discriminatory?

 My colleague sitting on the other side of 

the podium, I submit to the Court, does not answer that 

question. Petitioners feel that the answer to that 

question can be found in the text of the Fair Sentencing 

Act. And while we admit that there is no express 

answer, the text gives us the required fair implication.

 The text in section 8, the text in section 

10 -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Is a fair

implication enough? You're talking here about a repeal, 

essentially, of an earlier provision, section 109. And 

our cases uniformly say that it -- it has to be clear 

implication, unquestionable implication.

 Do you think this is really clear and 

unquestionable?

 MR. EBERHARDT: No, it is not, but the 

standard from this Court, Justice Scalia, is fair 

implication, and it has been ever since Great -- the 

Great Northern case. It -- the standards began -- I'm 

sorry -- as a necessary implication in Great Northern, 

moved to plain and clear implication in Hertz and 

Woodman, and then Marrero, which is relied on heavily by 

amicus.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, the 

statute itself says "express," right? Talking about 

section 109.

 MR. EBERHARDT: That is correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, we're pretty far 

removed from the language of the statute, I guess.

 MR. EBERHARDT: But, again, ever since 1908, 

that's a standard that this Court has not accepted. And 

this is based on the provision, the well-settled 

provision, that an earlier Congress cannot bind a later 

Congress.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, and I understand 

that. But presumably -- we also have the proposition 

that Congress, when it enacts legislation, knows the 

law. They would have known section 109 required an 

express statement if they wanted to apply the change 

retroactively. So, why shouldn't we hold them to that 

standard?

 MR. EBERHARDT: The answer is no, I don't 

believe that Congress felt that that was the standard. 

Again relying on this Court's jurisprudence that said 

you give us text and if we are able to find that the 

fair implication and the intent of Congress through that 

fair implication is that this new statute applies, 

because an earlier Congress cannot bind the newer 

Congress -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on your statement 

that the -­

Dictionary Act?

is, Your Honor. And we acknowledge -­

fact that 109 is on the books is relevant. And -- and 

it's not a question of one Congress binding the other. 

It's a question of what the second Congress did.

 MR. EBERHARDT: Yes, 109 is relevant, but 

it's the standard to be employed in determining whether 

or not there's a fair implication of what the later 

Congress meant.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm really troubled by 

"fair implication" -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're right that if -­

you're right -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How many -- how many cases 

do you have that say "fair implication" as opposed to 

quite a few that say "clear and unquestionable 

implication"?

 Marrero? Is that -- is that the one case 

you rely on?

 MR. EBERHARDT: Fair implication from 

Marrero -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: From a footnote in Marrero, 

right?

 MR. EBERHARDT: Correct.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Marcello? Where -- what's 

the cite for that?

 I mean, there are a lot of earlier cases 

that make it clear when you're repealing a prior statute 

if it isn't express, it has to be at least a clear 

implication. And I'm -- I'm astounded to think that in 

a footnote, we're suddenly going to change that to 

simply "fair implication."

 MR. EBERHARDT: Yes, Your Honor. You're 

correct, a clear or a necessary, but Petitioners contend 

that not only do we meet the fair implication 

standard -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's a different 

question. And we can talk about that. But how did 

Marrero come out? Did it -- did it find an overruling 

or not?

 MR. EBERHARDT: Marrero primarily was based 

on the fact that there was a specific provision for 

nonretroactivity. In an alternate holding, the Court 

held that 109 would also be relevant to the decision.

 Marrero, though, was a habeas -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, it did not find 109 

overcome by fair implication, right?

 MR. EBERHARDT: Correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, it's entirely dictum,

right? And dictum in a footnote.

 MR. EBERHARDT: No, I believe it is an 

alternative holding, because the primary holding in -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was the other 

way. The holding was that 109 governed. No?

 MR. EBERHARDT: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said the 

holding was that section 109 governed, that it had not 

been repealed.

 MR. EBERHARDT: 109 was the alternative 

holding, saying that 109 would also preclude the 

retroactivity provision.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. And, therefore, 

whatever it said about what is necessary for repeal of 

109 was purely dictum, because it held that 109 was not 

repealed. So, even if fair implication was the test, it 

was not the test applied and determinative in the case. 

So, it's dictum. And dictum in a footnote.

 MR. EBERHARDT: I don't agree, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's true of all of 

the cases that you -- the cases -- you pointed to two or 

three that use "fair implication." The Court in all 

those cases found that there was no fair implication, so 

that 109 governed.

Isn't -- isn't that so?

 That was true in Marrero. It was true in 

Northern Securities.

 MR. EBERHARDT: In Marrero, the primary 

holding was based on the fact that there was a specific 

provision for nonretroactivity.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in none of the cases 

that used the fair implication language did the Court 

say: And, therefore, the old statute no longer governs.

 MR. EBERHARDT: Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you're relying on a 

standard that this Court did -- must have considered 

appropriate because it deviated from the words of the 

statute. It said it a few times. But in application, 

it always came out the same way.

 MR. EBERHARDT: Well, in application, when 

the Court applied this in Marcello, when they were 

weighing the language of the Administrative Procedure 

Act as opposed to the language of the Immigration and 

Nationality Act, I think the Court made clear, as it 

went through the statute there, that there was a fair 

implication. And then once you get to the point of fair 

implication, it necessarily means that there is some 

kind of an ambiguity.

 And then the Court followed up saying that

we then did look to the legislative history, and the 

legislative history backs up the implication that we did 

find.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was not true of 

the 109 cases. You don't have a 109 case that said the 

standard is fair implication, and, therefore, the old 

statute is not enforced.

 MR. EBERHARDT: Directly? I don't believe 

so.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that if -­

JUSTICE ALITO: What do -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think that if we 

stick to the language of the statute, if we are, indeed, 

looking for an express provision, do you agree that 

there isn't any here?

 MR. EBERHARDT: We agree there is no express 

provision, but obviously, we also contend that going 

back to the proposition that an earlier Congress cannot 

bind a later, that that standard has been rejected even 

though argued by my colleague to my left. That is no 

longer the standard ever since -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I'm not sure he's 

arguing that. I think he acknowledges, as our opinions 

say, that it can be done by implication, but it has to 

be clear and unmistakable implication. I think that's

the position he's taking.

 Anyway, you want to tell me why this is 

clear and unmistakable?

 MR. EBERHARDT: When you look at the 

language of section 8, when Congress has mandated the 

Sentencing Commission to use their emergency authority 

to achieve consistency with other guideline provisions 

and applicable law, it makes clear that Congress meant 

this needs to take effect as soon as possible. Congress 

even said "as soon as practicable and no later than 

90 days."

 This would be meaningless, actually, with 

regard to the individuals who were in this pipeline to 

be sentenced, because there would be so few individuals 

who would be arrested, charged, convicted, and sentenced 

within that 90-day period that Congress could only -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there might be a few, 

but there -- but assume that you're drafting this 

legislation and you want it to apply only to defendants 

who commit an offense after the enactment of the Fair 

Sentencing Act, but you also want to do everything that 

you reasonably can to make sure that when the very first 

one of those defendants comes up for sentencing, there 

will be new sentencing guidelines in effect that are 

geared to the new lower mandatory minimums rather than

the old sentencing guidelines in effect.

 Would you not provide that the -- would you 

not require the Sentencing Commission to act as quickly 

as possible to get the new sentencing guidelines out?

 MR. EBERHARDT: No.

 JUSTICE ALITO: No?

 MR. EBERHARDT: Because of the -­

JUSTICE ALITO: You would say take your time 

and it doesn't matter if a few -- a few defendants who 

are -- who commit the offense after the enactment of the 

Fair Sentencing Act come up and they are -- they're 

subjected to the old soon-to-be-obsolete sentencing 

guidelines?

 MR. EBERHARDT: No. I think it's clear that 

the average time from charging to sentencing is going to 

be at least 11 months. In a case where a defendant goes 

to trial, it's going to be much more than that. So, 

there really need be no rush on the part of Congress to 

condense this down into 90 days. They could go through 

their usual 120-day -- or 180-day procedure, submit 

these to Congress, wait for approval or disapproval, and 

things like that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are we just supposed 

to assume that Congress knows that? I mean, if you had 

asked me how long is the usual time from conviction

or -- I mean, arrest to conviction, I wouldn't know if 

it's closer to 90 days or 11 months.

 MR. EBERHARDT: I think we do, Chief 

Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice. We have to know that 

Congress -- Congress knows that because these are the 

individuals who drafted the Sentencing Reform Act.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, right. But I 

mean -- and we assume Congress knows the law. I don't 

know that we can readily assume they know details such 

as that and evaluate their -- what would your position 

be if the Congress said do this as soon as practical 

but, in any event, no later than 8 months from now? 

Would we then think there's a fair implication that 

Congress meant it to apply retroactively or not?

 MR. EBERHARDT: On just the point of the 

immediacy placed on by Congress, I think that would take 

away from the fair implication that Congress meant that 

it -- the law should go -- or the law should be 

effective on the date of the President's signature.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why do you pick the date 

that the Fair Sentencing Act went into effect, if it -­

Commission came out with its new guidelines on 

November 1st, that's some time after August 3rd, which

isn't the right date the date that the Sentencing 

Guidelines went into effect?

 MR. EBERHARDT: The correct date is the 

August 3rd date, Your Honor, because of the intent of 

Congress made known through the implication of the 

language taken in the legal context of the Sentencing 

Reform Act. When Congress meant to correct their error, 

I believe they made it perfectly clear that they meant 

to correct this error as soon as possible. This has 

been an error that had been discussed for 25 years and 

was finally trying to be corrected.

 And, Mr. Chief Justice, if I might reserve 

the rest of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Fair Sentencing Act manifests the 

requisite fair and necessary implication that Congress 

intended that its new mandatory minimum thresholds apply 

in all sentencings after the date of the Act.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, as Justice Scalia 

explained in his concurring opinion in

standards of how another Congress is to enact 

legislation. The subsequent Congress is free to choose 

how it will express its will in the language or 

structure that it sees fit. And I'd like to give an 

example -­

no magical passwords that Congress has to use to explain 

itself.

 And let me give an example because I think 

that it will help to put in focus why I think the Fair 

Sentencing Act does contain the requisite implication. 

If Congress had written in the Fair Sentencing Act, 

henceforth, after the date of this Act, probation 

officers shall prepare presentence reports and submit 

them to courts in which they shall calculate the 

mandatory minimum penalties under the standards

the provisions that increased the thresholds of 

quantities necessary to trigger the mandatory minimum 

sentences.

to put this in the structural context of the Sentencing 

Reform Act. The Sentencing Reform Act directs courts to 

apply the version of the Sentencing Guidelines that is 

in effect on the day of sentencing. It's not a time of 

offense rule; it's a time of sentencing rule.

 And there -- that means that everybody who 

comes before the sentencing court after the date of the 

Fair Sentencing Act when the new guidelines are in place 

will have those guidelines applied to those defendants. 

Those guidelines are supposed to be conformed to 

applicable law. The only applicable law that there 

could be is the new mandatory minimum standard.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no, you're begging 

the question. The -- the law applicable to pre- -­

pre-statute offenses continues to be the prior law, and 

the applicable law to offenses that have occurred after 

the enactment date is the -­

MR. DREEBEN: But that would mean, 

Justice Scalia, that the guidelines would not be 

conformed to applicable law for the defendants who are 

sentenced after the FSA. They would be conformed to 

inapplicable law. And Congress knew when it set up 

section 3553(a) that the guidelines that would be 

applied are the ones that are in force at the time of 

sentencing.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, why -- why 

90 days? I mean, the Commission basically just took the 

ratio under the new Act and applied it, didn't they, 

throughout? They took the mandatory minimum formula 

that had been changed and changed it throughout the -­

the sentencing provisions?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, it was a little bit more 

complex than that, because what -- what the FSA did was 

two things: It lowered the mandatory minimums by 

increasing the crack thresholds, and it targeted role in 

the offense of the defendant for increased sentencing 

and mitigating factors for decreased sentencing. And 

the Commission had to translate that into new 

guidelines.

 It acted quickly. It was told to act as 

soon as practicable. It was entirely possible under the 

statute, and probably would have been desired by 

Congress, that new guidelines would have gone into 

effect on August 4th. At that point, the only people in 

front of the sentencing court would have been pre-FSA 

offenders.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but how -- how many 

are we talking about, say, a 3-month period? How 

many people commit -- most people -- everybody pleads 

guilty. They're caught quickly and sentenced quickly -­

that the applicable set of guidelines that will be

the defendant is sentenced. This is 3553(a)(4)(A)(ii).

was enacted. And Congress explained, for those who read 

legislative history, that it wanted -- and I am going to 

quote here from the legislative history: "The 

guidelines and policy statements to be applied are those 

in effect at the time of sentencing."

 Congress's reason for that was it wanted the 

most sophisticated statements available that will most 

appropriately carry out the purposes of sentencing, and 

to impose a sentence under outmoded guidelines will 

foster irrationality in sentencing and would be contrary 

to the goal of consistency in sentencing. So -­

is reversed on appeal and sent back for resentencing,

date of the initial sentencing shall be used. It's an 

exception to the general rule.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you this about 

your argument? Because I do think the one you're 

stressing now is a -- is a good argument and your best 

one. But what troubles me is that an earlier bill, H.R. 

265, which contained the provision that says "there 

shall be no retroactive application of any portion of 

this Act" contains the very language that you're 

stressing now.

 So, how do you reconcile that?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, first of all, 

Justice Alito, what that bill would have done is 

postpone the effective date for 180 days so that there 

could be synchronicity between the guidelines and the 

new mandatory minimums. The retroactivity that it was 

concerned about would have reopened final sentences. 

There's no question here about reopening final 

sentences. So, that bill was explicit: We don't want 

to reopen final sentences.

 The Government is not asking for reopening 

of final sentences.

wouldn't you want -- the problem that you're -- maybe --

post-enactment offenders, that there will be defendants

 JUSTICE ALITO: Would that not occur under

that -- that bill was designed to postpone the effective

 MR. DREEBEN: No, I'm saying that the

with the law surely applies to sentencing law; and 

Congress understood that once the new guidelines were in 

effect, which it wanted to happen as soon as 

practicable, they would be applied to all defendants in 

the system based on time of -- of sentencing, not time 

of offense. And it wanted those guidelines to be 

conformed to applicable law.

the repeal is of something that's unjust?

a remedy as we could, because it is one of the most 

fundamental tenets of our Constitution, as has been 

repeatedly emphasized in case after case, that our laws 

should be -- should be enforced in a race-neutral way.

 Once Congress has said this law's not being 

enforced in a race-neutral way, we want to fix it, why 

shouldn't our presumption be that the fix is immediate 

rather than delayed?

 MR. ESTRADA: Because I think it would be 

wrong to assume that the passage of the Act reflects 

Congress's concession of intentional discrimination. 

think it does recognize that there were members of 

Congress that had concerns about the disparate impact of 

the law.

Commission, as the Government points out, went to 

Congress again and again and again to say we don't agree 

with this, this makes no sense. And for 20 years, 

Congress could not bring itself to change it because 

there was no agreement on the part of the lawmakers that 

the public policy was that easy.

minimums be the old mandatory minimums.

 And what everybody understood was that if 

that were the case, if the new guidelines and the 

old mandatory minimums sort of -- both applied together, 

it would lead to ridiculous disparities in the way 

people were sentenced.

 And so, the question is, once having decided 

to do this, can't we assume that Congress decided to do 

it?

 MR. ESTRADA: No. Let me give three answers 

to that.

 I think, you know, one of the fundamental 

points here is that a premise of the law is to treat 

like people alike. And people who committed the same 

offense on the same date and may have done so with each 

other we would expect to get comparable punishment if 

they are comparably situated as to criminal history. 

And the -- that the solution that's being urged 

undermines that even though that is exactly what section 

109 says.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have to draw a 

line someplace, and that's inevitable, that -- that some 

people are going to fall on one side. But the point 

about the guidelines and the statute working together, 

wasn't there a time when the Sentencing Guidelines -­

they wanted to do away with this distinction and 

Congress said, no, Sentencing Commission, you can't do 

it, you can't do it to the guidelines when we don't do 

it to the statute?

 MR. ESTRADA: There are two points about the 

guidelines that I think we have to keep in mind, Justice 

Ginsburg. The first one is that they are guidelines, 

especially in the world after Booker, which is the world 

that confronted Congress in 2010. They are guides that 

must be considered by the judge to inform judicial 

discretion. So, in the nature of the guidelines, there 

is nothing inherent in saying that we must have new ones 

that also implies a new obligation of statutory law to 

people whose offense conduct occurred earlier.

 The second aspect of it is that it has been 

part of the nature of a guidelines system for two 

decades that it has been consistent with the decision by 

Congress in some areas to constrain the exercise of 

discretion with mandatory minimums. And this Court has 

recognized that in multiple occasions, in Kimbrough, in 

Neal, in DePierre, any number of cases. And the 

guidelines themselves in section 5G1 recognize that the 

mandatory minimum may trump a lower guideline.

 So, when you have a long history in 2010 of 

rulings from this Court acknowledging, as you said in

your opinion in Kimbrough, that this may lead to cliffs, 

et cetera, and you also have a recognition by the 

Commission itself that they have to integrate this 

reality of sentencing law into their own guidelines, 

there is very little basis for an inference that 

Congress in providing new guidelines would have 

contemplated that the effective date of the law would 

change -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Congress did say: 

Sentencing Commission, you conform your new guidelines 

to applicable law. The applicable law has got to be the 

new law, because if it were the old law, there's nothing 

to conform. There's nothing that they need to change. 

It's only that this -- section A(ii) makes sense only if 

the applicable law is the new law. Otherwise, the 

Commission doesn't have to do anything to achieve 

consistency.

 MR. ESTRADA: Justice Ginsburg, I am 

prepared to admit for purposes of this case, and I think 

it's probably the right answer, that Congress intended 

that the guidelines had to line up with the penalties of 

the FSA. The question is cui bono? For whose benefit? 

And Congress clearly contemplated for some of the 

reasons that you outlined that the system in the change 

in the statute would not do any good for people coming

guidelines would have been and when they would have come 

out absent the emergency authority. Absent any 

emergency authority, new guidelines would have come out 

November 1st, 2011, which would have been a good 

15 months after the passage of the FSA. And even under

even if there had been no amendment to the guideline, 

the judges would have known they weren't bound to the 

mandatory minimum and probably not bound to guidelines 

that hadn't been amended yet either.

new emergency guidelines, provided a sentencing range of 

him of 110 to 137. That's -- that's Mr. Hill. These 

are the new guidelines. He was sentenced to a mandatory 

minimum of 10, which is on -- on the lower end of that 

guideline.

 The only reason that case is in the U.S. 

Supreme Court is because, even after the new statute, 

the judge was of a mind that he wanted to use a 

one-to-one ratio. And that's why there's a controversy 

here. But the -- that highlights, you know, the point 

that I'm trying to make and that the Court made in 

Kimbrough, which is that the mandatory minimums tend to 

enforce a species of uniformity in a world in which the 

guidelines are advisory, and they do help uphold, you 

know, the principle that people that committed 

comparable offenses will have some rough comparability.

question -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I started with, with 

you, which is if we know that this new Congress has 

already determined that those -- that mandatory minimum

constructed, what would be the purpose of delaying 

implementation?

as a citizen, to cut the sentences of everybody who is 

already serving the sentence irrespective of finality. 

And the fact that Congress did not do that, which is a 

proposition on which everybody agrees, I think is 

powerful evidence that the assumption that this 

necessarily reflects a conclusion that the previous 

system was indisputably discriminatory as opposed to 

arguably discriminatory -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I would find that 

extraordinary, that they say it's racist, but we're

to -- to be sure, it's not in the new legislation, but 

it's the background against which the new legislation 

was adopted, and it seems to require that -- that the 

court use the guidelines in effect at the time of 

sentencing.

competing background rules. Section 109 is one of them 

and it says the old law shall be applied to people who

It is a directly applicable statute to the situation at

 This purported competing background rule is 

a rule that simply says a judge shall consider the 

guidelines then extant. And this is part of the advice 

that he gets. It implies nothing about the duty to

doesn't help us, because -- all the time, there are two 

different sets of guidelines that apply depending upon 

when you committed the crime. That's very common. All 

right. So, I agree with you that far.

 But now I'm worried about -- the last 

question Justice Scalia asked does, I think, focus this 

question, because we have not only 109; we have also 

the -- the one we're talking about now, and that says, 

normally, you will apply the guidelines in effect even 

to people who committed the crime before the new 

statute.

 MR. ESTRADA: Okay.

analogies? Has this ever happened before? Is there --

I can't find out how many people we're talking about. 

I'd like to know at least are there many other occasions 

when Congress amended mandatory minimums so there's some 

precedent? Any?

 MR. ESTRADA: Justice Breyer, this is a 

staple of what has happened in the lower courts in a 

routine application of section 109.

U.S. v. Smith from the Second Circuit, which -- which 

was authored by then-Judge Sotomayor. And it was a 

comparable case in which Congress had dropped the 

severity of a penalty.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. ESTRADA: It had to be -- you know, the 

penalty that deals with supervised release.

 And Congress had gone from a world in which 

a violation of supervised release had to be subject to a 

mandatory sentence, to a world in which the statute had 

been changed, to say that it was up in the discretion of 

the judge. By the time the offender came to court, he 

had violated his supervised release. And his argument, 

which was actually a lot more plausible than this one, 

was that before he violated, the law had changed, and he 

was now in effect now coming to the court for a new 

sentencing. Which is exactly analogous to this.

 The Second Circuit had no trouble in saying 

that a routine application of section 109 killed that 

claim because the offense was considered completed at 

the time it was committed; and, therefore, this was a -­

a claim that simply was not tenable in light of the 

language of section 109. And that, too, is a -- is a 

case where somebody could have said the law that now 

applies is the one that applies to my new sentencing

under the new applicable guidelines.

 Now, I will say another two logical points 

about, you know, the competing rule that the Government 

is urging.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Estrada, before you do, 

if I can understand your argument as it relates to 

Justice Scalia's questions -- I just want to make sure I 

understand it. There's a person who has 4.99 grams of 

crack cocaine. And you do not dispute, do you, that 

that person would be subject to the new guidelines, 

which are based on the 18-to-1 ratio rather than the 

100-to-1 ratio?

 MR. ESTRADA: I do not. And -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Okay. So, you do not 

dispute that. So -- so, then we're living in a world in 

which the person who has 4.99 grams of cocaine is 

getting the 18-to-1 ratio, and a person who has 5 grams 

is getting the 100-to-1 ratio that's embedded in the 

mandatory minimums.

 MR. ESTRADA: That is absolutely right, and 

that was the -- the paradox, if you want to call it 

that -- that the government brought you in Kimbrough. 

And the Court accepted that that was the case. It said, 

yes, this leads to cliffs. It leads to a lack of a 

straight line in between all of the possible penalties.

We accept all of that. It is an artifact of the fact 

that Congress at certain points, but not on a continuous 

line, has chosen to constrain sentencing discretion with 

the rough tool of a quantity threshold.

 It is all set out in the Kimbrough case.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Now, when Judge Easterbrook 

talked about this anomaly -- and he, of course, adopted 

the position that you adopted. But he just said, look, 

there is no earthly reason for this. It's just that we 

can't find a clear enough statement in the statute.

 I guess the question I would ask you is: 

Can you do better than Judge Easterbrook? Can you find 

an earthly reason for why Congress would have wanted to 

create this weird halfway system in which, if you have 

4-1/2 grams of cocaine, one rule applies, but if you 

have 5 grams, another rule applies?

 MR. ESTRADA: I don't think that that's what 

he found inexplicable. I think the -- you know, the 

whole notion of changing it up to a point was more what 

he's saying.

 I can think that Congress has at least the 

rational reason that the Court ascribed to the system in 

its post-Booker way at the top of page 108, I think, in 

the Kimbrough case, where it is that now that we have a 

system in which so much depends on the discretion of the

few points of confluence that work as an enforced, 

although rough, uniformity in the sentences of 

comparably situated offenders.

 If I go back -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Government is 

arguing and the Petitioner is arguing for a uniform 

rule, the rule that the time of sentencing controls.

 MR. ESTRADA: Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that uniformity doesn't

MR. ESTRADA: No, I think that they are 

competing visions of fairness and of uniformity in this

the Government to the one they had in the McNeill case 

last year, because the identical argument was made to 

them in the -- on the other side, that it was somewhat 

irrational to apply the better sentence to the person 1 

day later versus the person 1 day earlier.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Justice Kagan's 

question concerning what interest is served by your 

position has particular force when we're talking about 

the sentencing judge. The hardest thing -- as we know 

in the judicial system, one of the hardest things is 

sentencing. And you're saying that a sentencing judge

contemplated new guidelines but not necessarily take up, 

you know, the Government's view that this is actually 

called for by the very end of that section, applicable 

law, is that the Government looks at this as a world in 

which Congress has now intervened and in effect 

compelled a -- a more linear function of sentencing so 

that, henceforth, I guess the Commission has to conform 

to the -- to the 18-to-1 ratio, and it would no longer 

be open to the Commission, for example, to do what it 

did in 2007, which is we changed our mind; there is a

be 16 to 1.

 And -- and one of the reasons why I am 

reluctant to urge you to accept, you know, the 

Government's construction, which I can see how they 

would be helped by in future cases, is that I think it's 

very implausible for Congress to have considered this, 

as they say, the centerpiece of the statute and have -­

have it be the last depending clause of section 8.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Wait, wait. This is -­

just tell me if maybe the light is dawning, and maybe 

I'm just at the same question Justice Kagan asked. 

Think of before the statute. There were two sets of 

people: Those people subject to the mandatory minimum 

and those crack people who -- the mandatory minimum 

didn't matter, but the Commission wrote amendments 

consistent with.

 So, they were tough amendments, though the 

law didn't require it -­

MR. ESTRADA: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- to produce consistency. 

Now the statute's passed. Now we have some of the 

pre-Act offenders. Because of the two sets of things,

to new conforming amendments that conform to the new

 And that -- because that'll have to be 

because of the combination of the two sections that Mr. 

Dreeben read, the -- all right. Now, if that's so, we 

get to the cliffs that Justice Kagan is talking about. 

And if I'm right so far, we're now back at the probation 

officer example, and it's so odd and so peculiar that it 

is not just a fair -- do you see where I'm going?

law, which, you know, the Government reads as the new 

ratio and could extend to other things, could 

potentially disable the Commission from adopting its own 

ameliorating amendments that depart from the regime 

of -- of the mandatory minimums. And so, whereas there 

are mandatory minima that are troublesome and give rise 

to cliffs, there are also occasions in which the 

Commission is able to do things that are not consistent 

with the statute.

 Let me give one example that was mentioned 

by the Court in DePierre. As the statute was 

interpreted in DePierre, cocaine base is cocaine base; 

it gets you a mandatory minimum if it's chemically 

based. The Commission thinks that you only get the 

enhanced penalties if the cocaine base happens to be 

crack.

 Similarly, under the Neal case, you get to 

weigh the carrier medium for the LSD, but, you know, the 

Commission thinks that you give it a presumed weight 

that is probably lower than the actual medium. In both 

of those cases, the Commission comes up with guidelines 

that are lower than the methodology that is contemplated 

under the statutory analysis.

assumption that the Congress has now dictated that these

be included, the guidelines can't change that. The

The LSD guideline that was at issue in Neal and the 

crack guideline that was not at issue but was discussed 

in connection with the statutory interpretation in -- in 

DePierre.

 You know, my point -- I don't want to 

overstate the point. My point is there is reason to 

believe that Congress intended the new guidelines to be 

available for new offenses. The fact that Congress gave 

emergency authority so that that would be possible makes 

perfect sense because in the absence of emergency 

authority, the new guidelines would not -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. You have to -­

what you're arguing is not that the guidelines would be

they would be available for everybody except the 

cliffhangers. That -- that's what you're arguing.

 MR. ESTRADA: Except for? I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Everyone but the 

cliffhangers, because, as Justice Breyer pointed out, 

those people who were subject to the old guideline at a 

higher rate above the minimum now have the benefit of a 

lower rate. And so, they're going to get sentenced to a 

lower amount because they're not bound by the mandatory 

minimum.

alternative worlds after the FSA, Justice Sotomayor. In 

the first one, guidelines don't change for 15 months. 

People who committed the crime after the FSA come to the 

court for sentencing 10 months later and they get the 

new mandatory minimum, but it doesn't matter because the 

old guidelines are higher. It is possible that the 

judge would intervene and use Booker discretion, but not 

necessarily so.

 And the alternative world which Congress did 

give us is you change the guidelines as soon as you can; 

if you come to the bar of the court with a pre-FSA 

offense, it doesn't matter, because the new guidelines, 

like every guidelines book since the beginning, say that 

if a mandatory minimum applies, that controls over the 

then-current guidelines, which is one of the fundamental 

reasons why the alternative view of the world and the 

alternative rule of construction the Government proffers 

makes no sense.

 As a pure statutory construction matter and 

for those members of the Court who give weight to 

legislative history, I will point out that the emergency 

authority section that the Government thinks is 

dispositive on this point was in every version of this 

bill -- Senate 1711, Senate 1383, you know, the House 

versions that they cite -- even when those statutes, as

could I -- could I ask you this question, which is

argument about bringing the guidelines into consistency

that one attempts to get from it?

 Suppose the -- the Fair Sentencing Act said 

expressly this applies only -- the new mandatory 

minimums apply only to post-Act offenders, but it also 

contained a provision that says the Sentencing 

Commission has to bring the guidelines into consistency 

with applicable law. I assume there what they would 

have to do would be to say that the new guidelines apply 

only to post-enactment offenders, so that the Fair 

Sentencing Act would trump this previous provision in 

the Sentencing Reform Act. Wouldn't that be correct?

 MR. ESTRADA: Correct. And I think that 

that would be true here as well. And the reason why I 

was highlighting the earlier bills is because each and 

every one of them had the same, almost word for word, 

"conform with applicable law" emergency authority. All

not apply for another 6 months after the enactment.

 As a logical proposition, if Congress 

thought that the identical language made sense to bring 

the guidelines into conformity with a law that would not 

take into -- that would not kick in for another 6 

months, having it kick in sooner does not have any more 

logical import in saying that, therefore, you know, the 

guidelines now mean that previous offenses get a 

different sentence.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But could I understand what 

you're saying, Mr. Estrada? Because if Justice Alito is 

right, then the new guidelines that the Sentencing 

Commission has in fact promulgated should not be being 

applied right now to those who committed crimes before 

the enactment date. And that's not what's happening now 

on the ground, is it?

 MR. ESTRADA: Justice Kagan, it is not 

happening in that manner because the guidelines, every 

book of the guidelines, I believe since 1987, which is 

the first one, has had, like, 5G1.1, which says these 

are the guidelines, but 5G tells you if a mandatory 

minimum applies, for whatever reason, you apply that and 

that becomes the mandatory sentence.

 And so, there has never been any reason to 

have two sets of guidelines to account for cliffs or

mandatory minimums, because every guidelines book has 

had a built-in solution to that problem, which is we 

understand that there are cliffs, we understand that 

there is a world of mandatory minimums; we can't fix 

those, this is our guideline sentence. If somehow, for 

some reason -- because it occurred, you know, before or 

whatever -- there is a mandatory minimum that applies, 

the guidelines say the mandatory minimum becomes the 

guideline sentence.

 So, in that sense, a Congress that knew the 

law would understand that saying you have to have new 

guidelines had no logical force in saying that, 

therefore, the effective date of mandatory minimums or 

any other factor that bore on the application of 

mandatory minimums would be changed.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN E. EBERHARDT

difficulty of those district court judges sitting and 

asking themselves: What do I do with this defendant as 

opposed to another defendant? And after listening to my 

colleague, Mr. Estrada, I still have to ask the Court to 

consider the question that the Court has been asking: 

What possible reason could Congress have to want a 

district court judge to have to sit back, 5 years after 

the date of enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act, and 

impose mandatory minimums that everyone agrees at this 

point are racially discriminatory?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you could say 

that about any statute that runs afoul of -- of section 

109. I mean, that's what section 109 says: Even though 

we have decided that this old law is bad and the penalty 

should be lesser, even though we've decided, when we do 

that, you continue to apply the bad old penalty to 

people who committed a crime before the amendment. 

Isn't that what 109 says?

 MR. EBERHARDT: It can be, but, as Justice 

Sotomayor recognizes, there has never been a situation 

such as this basically in the history of criminal law 

and criminal law sentencing in our country.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'd imagine you'd find 

disagreement with that. You know -- you know -- you 

know if -- as a matter of fact, in the year that these

took effect, think of the sentences that were not 

governed by mandatory for crack, not governed by the 

mandatory minimum. Did the guidelines provide, let's 

call it a low sentence, disproportionately low?

 MR. EBERHARDT: Congress ultimately felt 

that they did, yes, because what they -­

non-mandatory part when they wrote new ones?

 MR. EBERHARDT: The guidelines changed in 

different respects with regard to different amounts.

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. I'll look it 

up. I'll look it up.

 MR. EBERHARDT: I suggest the Court -- we 

admit that 109 has to be considered in the case, but I 

think to find what was really meant by Congress, after 

the Court looks to section 109, the Court does have to 

look to the 3553 sentence -- or 3553 section, that makes 

it very plainly clear, ever since the Sentencing Reform 

Act, that the date of sentencing clearly is the 

important date, as opposed to the date of the commission 

of the crime.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All those arguments 

have nothing to do with the provision about the 

Sentencing Commission is supposed to act quickly or any

of that, right?

 Your argument is what rational reason could 

Congress have had to -- given the urgency of the 

problem, the seriousness, why wouldn't they have wanted 

the provisions to apply as you urged they should?

 MR. EBERHARDT: But it goes hand-in-hand 

with the mandate from the Sentencing Commission to put 

the new guidelines in place as soon as practical, as 

well as provisions of section 10.

 Thank you very much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Eberhardt.

 Mr. Estrada, at the invitation of the Court, 

you have briefed and argued this case as an amicus 

curiae in support of the judgment below. You've ably 

discharged that responsibility, for which the Court is 

grateful.

 The case is submitted.
