CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-905, Merck and Company v. 

Reynolds. 

Mr. Shanmugam. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

The statute of limitations for private 

securities fraud claims incorporates the equitable 

principle known as the discovery rule; that is, the 

principle that the limitations period begins to run from 

the discovery of the facts constituting the violation. 

Under the discovery rule, a plaintiff who suspects the 

possibility that the defendant has engaged in wrongdoing 

is on inquiry notice and thereafter must exercise 

reasonable diligence in investigating his potential 

claim. 

The court of appeals in this case erred at 

the first step --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor, that presumes 

that then Congress is using unnecessary words when it 

differentiates in a statute between discovery of facts

constituting a violation and a different statute, like 

section 13 or 77m, however you want to call it, when 

it says "due diligence." 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, Congress did say that, 

Justice Sotomayor, in section 77m, section 13 of 

the 1933 Act, but we don't think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So are we supposed to 

presume that they like using unnecessary words? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we don't think that 

Congress's inclusion of that express language referring 

to constructive discovery in that provision was 

significant, and that's because of the default 

understanding --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're answering me 

yes, it's unnecessary. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: We don't think it makes any 

difference in terms of the application of the rule. 

And, indeed, there are cases applying section 13 of the 

1933 Act that interpret it in exactly the same manner 

that we’re suggesting the Court should interpret section 

1658(b) in, in this case. 

And that’s simply because the default 

understanding has long been that when a statute of 

limitations is triggered by a discovery rule, that 

includes both express and -- both actual and

constructive discovery, and with the exception of three 

sentences in Respondents' brief, the parties before this 

Court are really in agreement on that proposition. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you want to go beyond 

constructive discovery? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, no, Justice Scalia. 

We believe that the concept of constructive discovery 

itself incorporates the specific principle of inquiry 

notice, which is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think there’s a 

line between constructive discovery -- constructive 

discovery asks, when should you have known? And the 

rule you are arguing for is something beyond that. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we are asking the 

Court to adopt the principle of inquiry notice, but we 

don't believe that that is a particularly significant 

additional step. And that is simply because that 

principle has likewise long been understood as part of 

the discovery rule with regard to fraud claims 

specifically, and it was well understood to be part of 

the application of the discovery rule with regard to 

securities fraud claims specifically, at the time 

Congress enacted section 1658(b). 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Under your rule, what 

happens when you are put on inquiry notice? That's the

point at which you should be conducting additional 

investigation, right? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: That's right, and at least 

where --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's where the 

-- statute begins to run, at the point when you 

should have conducted additional investigation? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: At least where a plaintiff 

fails to conduct an investigation --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: -- as is the case here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: -- the limitations period --

JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would you --

what would you -- what phrase would you use to describe 

what happens when inquiry notice culminates in finding 

out? You have to say, oh, there looks like there might 

be scienter, I have to look at it. And after a year, 

you find it; yes, there was scienter. What -- what 

would you call what happens when they find out there was 

scienter? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think it's true that 

at that point the plaintiff discovers the remaining 

fact, and so to the extent that the Court embraces our

fallback approach, under which a plaintiff who actually 

exercises reasonable diligence and conducts an 

investigation gets the benefit of additional time, one 

can essentially embrace and codify that understanding of 

the words of the statute, which is to say a plaintiff at 

the point of inquiry notice suspects the possibility 

that the plaintiff has a claim. The plaintiff may not 

be in possession of information bearing on each and 

every element of the underlying violation, but if the 

plaintiff at that point exercises reasonable diligence 

and uncovers, discovers any remaining information --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how could --

MR. SHANMUGAM: -- at that point the 

plaintiff will have discovered the underlying facts. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- how could that --

let's descend from the abstract to the concrete that is 

this case. The story that was being put out is, yes, 

this drug may produce heart attacks, but there’s no 

indication that it does so -- that the other drug that 

it's comparing with may have an anti-heart attack 

element. And that's accepted. We could -- it could be 

one explanation; it could be the other. 

How would the most diligent plaintiff have 

gone about finding out whether Merck really had no good 

faith belief in this so-called naproxen hypothesis?

MR. SHANMUGAM: Right. Well, just to be 

clear, as a preliminary matter, as I understand 

Respondents' position, it is that the alleged 

misstatement in this case is that Merck made 

misstatements when it expressed its belief that the 

naproxen hypothesis was the likely explanation for the 

disparity in cardiovascular events that was reported in 

the VIGOR study. 

Now, as a first-order response, we believe 

that there was considerable information in the public 

domain suggesting the possibility that Petitioners had 

engaged in securities fraud when they made those 

statements. At that point, we believe that Respondents 

were on inquiry notice, and that is a point that is more 

than 2 years before the limitations period --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, excuse me. To --

MR. SHANMUGAM: -- before the plaintiffs 

filed. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: To say that, you must 

believe that there is substantial evidence of fraud when 

there is simply substantial evidence of inaccuracy, 

without --

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, there was more than 

that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- without any evidence of

scienter. What evidence of scienter was there? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, most notably, you had 

the FDA specifically accusing Merck of deliberate 

wrongdoing in connection with its public representations 

concerning the cardiovascular safety of Vioxx. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but deliberate 

wrongdoing -- as I understood that, it was simply you 

didn't give adequate weight to the -- to the other -- to 

the other side of it. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, but the FDA did more 

than that in the warning letter. It accused Merck of 

misrepresenting the cardiovascular safety profile of 

Vioxx, and it accused Merck of minimizing the potential 

of cardiovascular arrests. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That means it's -- that 

means it's wrong. You can misrepresent something 

without having scienter to defraud. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: But I do think that the fair 

reading of the FDA warning letter is that the FDA was 

accusing Merck of intentional misrepresentation. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it didn't stop it. 

Didn't -- didn't Merck submit a curative label, 

whatever, and the FDA said that was okay? And that --

that submission continued to give the naproxen 

hypothesis? Not the -- the reason that we are seeing

this heart attack thing showing up is that the other 

drug has a -- has a clotting inhibitor. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, it is true that Merck 

continued to maintain its belief in the naproxen 

hypothesis. We don't believe that that is sufficient 

somehow to toll the running of the limitations period. 

Such an approach would render the limitations period in 

section 1658(b) effectively triggered by a continuing 

violation theory. 

But I do want to get back to your question 

about what more the plaintiffs in this case could have 

done, because I do think that that is a very critical 

question here. 

We do believe that there was sufficient 

information in the public domain to cause Respondents to 

suspect the possibility that Petitioners had engaged in 

wrongdoing. At that point, there are several things 

that Respondents could have done. They could have 

talked to experts to test the validity of Merck’s 

naproxen hypothesis. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But one of the things they 

could not have done was file a lawsuit right then. Is 

that correct? Because they would not have had adequate 

facts to comply with the rules barring plaintiffs from 

filing suits based on information and belief?

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we don't believe that 

the Respondents would have had sufficient information to 

file a complaint then; and, indeed, we have taken the 

position that they still don't have sufficient facts to 

satisfy the PSLRA's pleading requirements. And I think 

it's notable in this case that Respondents really can't 

point to any facts that came into the public domain 

between the date of the FDA warning letter and the date 

in October of 2003 when the plaintiffs first filed 

suit --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if we had that 

MR. SHANMUGAM: -- that somehow provided 

them additional information. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we had that kind of 

analysis, where the -- where the company has to reserve 

all of its defenses, then we would never get to the 

statute of limitations problem. I think we have to 

assume that the -- that their theory of the case is 

correct. We have to -- to assume it for statute of 

limitations purposes. Of course, you deny it. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Right. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I think you 

don't get -- get very far. And -- and it seems to me, 

as Justice Stevens's and Justice Ginsburg's questions

indicate, that the companies can't have it both ways. 

They can't endorse the Twombly case and then say just an 

inquiry notice of a general -- of a general nature 

suffices. You have to have specific evidence of 

scienter. And there’s nothing here to indicate that 

the plaintiffs had that. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, it may very well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even on -- on -- but you 

have you to say, on their theory of the case. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: It may very well be that the 

plaintiffs have to possess at least some information 

bearing on scienter. And again, under our fallback 

approach, where a plaintiff suspects that a defendant 

has engaged in securities fraud but doesn't, at the 

point of inquiry notice, possess information bearing on 

every element of the claim, if the plaintiff then 

investigates, the plaintiff will have the benefit of 

additional time until the plaintiff comes into 

possession of --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me --

MR. SHANMUGAM: -- information relating to 

scienter. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me what 

that investigation would entail? Meaning, you started 

by saying, go talk to experts, but I'm not sure what

talking to experts would have added to the market mix of 

information. You either pick one expert who said the 

theory was sound or one who didn't. 

Outside of publicly available information, 

what -- and finding it -- what other inquiry could they 

have made that would have led them to discover 

sufficient information to file a lawsuit? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: I think, Justice Sotomayor, 

that there are at least a couple of other things they 

could have done. One thing that they could have done is 

talked to former Merck employees and consultants. 

Another thing that they could have done is 

talk to the lawyers who had filed other Vioxx-related 

lawsuits. There were quite a few as of the inquiry 

notice date. There were even more by the time they 

actually filed the securities fraud complaint. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Assuming they had talked 

to those lawyers, is there anything to suggest that 

those lawyers had more information than the ones they 

included in the publicly available lawsuit? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, there’s no way to 

know, of course, because the plaintiffs in this case 

failed to conduct an investigation at all. One other 

thing --

question. Is there some information in some publicly 

filed lawsuit up until the time of the filing of this 

lawsuit that disclosed more information about scienter 

than existed? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: I would say that the very 

fact that other lawsuits were filed that accused Merck 

of making intentional misrepresentations with regard to 

the very same statements that are at issue here actually 

itself constitutes additional information that should 

have put the plaintiffs on inquiry notice in the first 

place. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How when -- when there 

were -- doctors across the country were continuing to 

write prescriptions for this, when the market apparently 

accepted this -- it may be one thing, it may be another 

-- but there were not signals from the market itself, 

and the medical profession seemed to be going on and 

writing -- lots of doctors were writing prescriptions 

for this? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, first of all, Justice 

Ginsburg, the market did respond. We don't think that a 

market response is dispositive for purposes of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Very brief. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: -- inquiry notice analysis.

but it came right back up again. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: A brief drop in response to 

the FDA warning letter, a substantial drop, but the 

stock price did rebound; and a longer term drop over the 

course of 2001 when the various other events that are 

discussed in the briefs were occurring. So I think that 

there was a --

JUSTICE ALITO: Your arguing that if the --

if the plaintiffs' attorneys made diligent 

investigation, they would have uncovered facts about the 

safety of Vioxx that the FDA was unaware of? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well --

JUSTICE ALITO: Because the FDA never took 

any action during this period, other than changing the 

label. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, the FDA did issue the 

warning letter, and the label was changed to incorporate 

language indicating the cardiovascular disparity from 

the VIGOR study. That took place in 2002. And I think 

that it is noteworthy for purposes of the merits of this 

case that the FDA itself thought that that was 

sufficient. 

But in this case, Respondents seem to be 

pointing to much later information as the point on which 

they were on inquiry notice. They seem to suggest in

their brief that they were not on inquiry notice until 

as late as 2004 when The Wall Street Journal published 

an article disclosing certain internal e-mails. 

Now, leaving aside the sort of fundamental 

embarrassment to their position, I would submit, that 

that suggests that they were on inquiry notice after the 

complaint was actually filed. I --

JUSTICE BREYER: But the -- I take it the 

point of general principle, as opposed to this case, is 

I take it you will concede the following: Let's imagine 

on January 1 some investors look out and there are 

not only storm clouds, thunder, whatever you want, lots 

to put them on notice. So then the statute begins to 

run. But it could be the case that once they start to 

investigate, there is a key element, say scienter, the 

only evidence for which would take them an extra six 

months to find, because it's in the hands of a person 

who is in jail in Burma. All right? 

(Laughter.) 

So, you are prepared to say in that 

situation the statute does not begin to run on 

January 1; it begins to run on July 1, if they really 

look into it. But if they don't really look into it, 

then it’s January 1. That's I think the basic 

difference, as I gather, between the sides, or one major

difference in this case. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that's correct, 

Justice Breyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, if that's 

correct, why? That is to say, it seems to me that, in 

treating these differently, you have proposed a real 

morass for courts to get into. 

Did they really investigate on January 1? 

Was it an inadequate investigation? Was it a thorough 

investigation? Along with the difficulty of drawing a 

distinction between why it should be that that 

difference should exist, why not just apply the same 

rule to the investors whether they really do investigate 

or whether they don't and in both cases the statute 

begins to run on July 1, not January 1? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: I think there’s no doubt, 

Justice Breyer, that the easiest rule in some sense for 

the Court to apply would be a rule that started the 

clock running from the date of inquiry notice. But when 

you're comparing our fallback position, a rule that is 

triggered by an actual investigation by the plaintiff, 

with Respondents' rule, which looks to what a 

hypothetical plaintiff could have done, I really do 

believe that our rule is going to be much easier to 

administer because Respondents' rule by definition calls

for speculation. And in the context --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not say that because 

of one -- one element of the claim is scienter, that 

there’s no inquiry notice based on -- there may have 

been a misrepresentation, whether it was innocent or 

deliberate, we have no way of knowing. Why not say 

because scienter is an element of the claim, and you 

can't get your foot in the door in the court unless you 

can plead that with particularity, that it's only when 

you have that indication that you have what you call 

inquiry notice? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, again, Justice 

Ginsburg, the fundamental inquiry, so to speak, in 

determining whether a plaintiff is on inquiry notice is 

simply whether a reasonable investor based on the 

information in the public domain would at least suspect 

the possibility that the defendant has engaged in 

securities fraud. And a plaintiff need not possess 

information bearing on each and every element of the 

underlying violation in order to be on inquiry notice. 

Were the rule otherwise, the concept of inquiry notice 

would collapse --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's inquiry -- it's 

notice of what? And -- the law is that one element 

that must be pleaded with particularity. If you don't

have that, you have no claim. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well -- well, that's 

correct. But this Court has never tethered the running 

of the limitations period to the ability to satisfy any 

applicable heightened pleading requirements. Indeed, to 

the contrary, in Rotella, this Court held quite the 

opposite. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if not, then the 

whole storm warning theory that you have conceded 

doesn't work. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I -- I’m by no means 

conceding that the storm warning theory doesn't work. I 

am simply suggesting that a plaintiff need not possess 

information specifically relating to scienter in order 

to be on inquiry notice. And that, we would --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then he would have to file 

a complaint possibly before he has enough evidence to 

even bring a case. That is, suppose my guy in Burma is 

going to be in jail for 3 years; he can't get to him 

for 3 years. Now, he's going to have to file his 

complaint before he could have the evidence that there 

was scienter. Now, that doesn't make sense to me. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, there are certainly 

going to be cases, Justice Breyer, in which a plaintiff 

frankly can never get to the point where the plaintiff

can satisfy the PSLRA's pleading requirements. And I 

think it's noteworthy that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: In those cases, of course, 

the statute would not run. Is that right? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: No. We certainly don't 

believe --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If we go back to the text 

of the statute, it says 2 years after discovery, and you 

argue it should mean 2 years after he should have 

discovered, though -- and that period being measured by 

a date from inquiry notice, which is not mentioned in 

the statute at all. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that in 

understanding the term "discovery," Justice Stevens --

that term really can't be meaningfully understood 

without reference to the common law against which the 

statute was enacted. And this Court in interpreting 

discovery rules --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you do agree that you 

are reading as though it meant 2 years after he should 

have discovered? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that's right, and, 

again, I think that getting to the point of "should have 

discovered" is a fairly modest step. But this Court has 

repeatedly made clear in interpreting the discovery rule

that a plaintiff must exercise reasonable diligence in 

order to invoke the rule's benefits, and that is simply 

because the discovery rule is an equitable rule, and it 

effectively incorporates the principle of laches, that 

is the principle that a plaintiff who sleeps on his 

rights is not entitled to the benefits of equity. 

Indeed --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shanmugam, in Lampf we 

-- we had to choose between what statute of limitations 

provision, Federal one, we thought applied. And we had 

two choices: One was section 77m, which reads: “After 

such discovery” -- "after the discovery of the untrue 

statement or the omission or after such discovery should 

have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence." 

That was one choice. 

The other choice was 78i(e), which simply 

said: "unless brought within one year after the 

discovery of the facts constituting the violation.” No 

statement of "or after it should have been made by the 

exercise," okay? We chose the latter in Lampf. 

Now, you are telling me that there was no 

choice between the two, that -- that "after discovery" 

always means after discovery was made or after it should 

have been made? What were we doing in Lampf, spinning 

our wheels?

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, no, I don’t --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I read this -- this 

statute -- and 1658 tracks, not 77m, which says "after 

discovery should have been made"; it tracks 78i(e), 

which says "after discovery." Now, to me that means 

after discovery, period. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, Justice Scalia, the 

Court did choose to essentially incorporate the language 

from -- it was section 9(e) of the 1934 Act. There were 

various provisions in the '33 Act and the '34 Act that 

incorporated discovery rules. And that’s one --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, just tell me what the 

difference it was between 77m and 77i(e)? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What was the difference, 

unless it was that 77m -- I'm sorry, 78i(e) --

absolutely required knowledge? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think one potential 

difference is that section 13, section 77m, refers to 

discovery of the untrue statement or the omission. But 

I think more broadly with regard to both section 9(e) 

and the other provisions of the 1934 Act to which the 

Court looked, courts had actually construed those 

provisions as reaching both actual and constructive 

discovery at the time the Court decided Lampf. So I

MR. SHANMUGAM: No, there was really --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and we were just wasting

MR. SHANMUGAM: There was no difference 

between the two, and I think really for the reasons that 

the government states in its brief as well as the 

reasons that we state in our opening brief, the default 

understanding has always been that a reference to 

discovery includes at least constructive discovery. And 

a rule that triggers the limitations period from actual 

discovery would have significant vices because it would 

give plaintiffs --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -- could you 

tell me what the difference is between actual knowledge 

and constructive knowledge? Because as I read the amici 

who have submitted briefs arguing that actual discovery 

should be our standard, they appear to say that actual 

discovery or actual knowledge includes anything that’s 

in the public domain; that parties are presumed -- and 

we have plenty of cases that say that -- to know what's 

out there. 

So outside of that, how would constructive

knowledge or constructive discovery be any different? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It would require the 

shareholder to find the guy in Burma? Or to go and 

attempt in every case to engage employees in 

dishonorable conduct by talking about their business in 

private, company business -- as I understood it, we were 

asking employees to engage in potentially fiduciary 

breaches? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: I think it's an open 

question, Justice Sotomayor, as to what actual discovery 

would -- would actually mean, and I think that there 

would be a pretty good argument that you don't actually 

discover the underlying facts until the plaintiff 

himself subjectively actually has them in his 

possession. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that's going 

further than the amici are suggesting. The amici are 

suggesting -- and assuming we accept their suggestion --

that it should be everything that’s in the public 

domain, which seems reasonable to me. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What, in addition, do 

you think constructive knowledge would include that the 

actual knowledge standard doesn't?

MR. SHANMUGAM: -- of that information. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what in addition to

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, for purposes of the 

inquiry notice analysis, I think that that's all you 

look to. You look to either information in the 

plaintiff's possession or information in the public 

domain. And once there is sufficient information –-

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So -- so you are 

conceding amici's point that actual -- an actual 

knowledge standard is the same as a constructive 

knowledge standard? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I would hope at a 

minimum that if the Court were to embrace an actual 

discovery standard, it would look to information in the 

public domain, precisely because otherwise you really 

would be rewarding an ostrich plaintiff because a 

plaintiff who claimed not to read what was in the 

newspapers could have the benefit of additional time.

But --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if actual knowledge 

means things that the plaintiff doesn't actually know, 

then I don't know what the difference is between actual 

knowledge and constructive knowledge. It's a 

meaningless distinction if that's how actual knowledge 

is defined. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, again, that’s not how 

I would ordinarily understand the phrase "actual 

knowledge." But I think that it's important to remember 

that if in essence the standard that this Court were to 

adopt is a standard that does not start the clock 

running until there is sufficient information in the 

public domain for a plaintiff actually to plead a 

complaint, that would radically extend the limitations 

period for private securities fraud actions. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what is the problem --

MR. SHANMUGAM: No circuit --

JUSTICE ALITO: What is wrong with the --

with the inquiry notice rule that the court of appeals 

in this case set out on pages 29a to 30a of the joint 

appendix? This is from a Seventh Circuit -- quoting 

from a Seventh Circuit decision: "The facts 

constituting inquiry notice must be sufficiently 

probative of fraud, sufficiently advanced beyond the

stage of a mere suspicion, sufficiently confirmed or 

substantiated, not only to incite the victim to 

investigate but also to enable him to tie up any loose 

ends and complete the investigation in time to file a 

timely suit." 

So that the statute would run upon inquiry 

notice, provided that within the 2-year period, the 

plaintiff could, if the plaintiff diligently 

investigated, find sufficient facts to -- to file a 

complaint that would satisfy -- satisfy the PLRA? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: I think I’ll answer that 

question, and then I would like to reserve the balance 

of my time. 

I think the only problem with that rule is 

that, at the tail end, it effectively mandates the same 

hypothetical plaintiff inquiry that Respondents suggest. 

It requires a court to attempt to assess whether a 

plaintiff could have discovered the remaining 

information within a 2-year period. And that has all 

of the same vices, we would submit, as Respondents' rule 

and the government's rule. 

I’d like to reserve the balance of my time.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

Our position is that Congress intended the 

word "discovery" in section 1658 to have its normal and 

well-established meaning. 

By contrast, Merck asks the Court to add 

concepts to section 1658 not found in its text by 

interpreting the word "discovery" to mean suspicion and 

for the 2-year limitations period to be triggered when 

facts cause an investor to suspect the possibility of 

fraud. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're adding --

you’re adding concepts to it, as well. Nobody arguing 

before us intends discovery to mean actual discovery. 

Your -- you say constructive knowledge is enough; don't 

you? 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, we say, at the first 

part of our submission, that the Court can decide the 

case on an actual discovery -- actual knowledge 

standard. 

We have gone on to brief constructive 

discovery because, prior to 1934, in the numerous State 

statutes that use the phrase "discovery of facts 

constituting," many courts had adopted a constructive

knowledge standard. 

We think we win under either standard. If 

the Court decides this is an actual knowledge case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can -- can you tell me 

what you see as the difference between the two? I keep 

going back to what the amici has argued, which is actual 

knowledge that includes knowledge of what's in the 

public domain, under the theory that every shareholder 

is presumed to know what's in the public domain because 

that's what they buy with and that's the market theory 

of securities law. 

So, what do you see as a difference between 

the two? 

MR. FREDERICK: In a fraud-on-the-market 

case, like this one, where an efficient market is 

pleaded, there’s no practical difference. In an 

individual case, where the securities fraud alleges that 

an individual investor is harmed by the individual 

actions of some broker or some other person, there could 

very well be a difference in terms of what the 

reasonable investor should have known on the basis of 

information that would be available. 

And the point of the constructive knowledge 

standard was to have plaintiffs not rest on their --

their ability to hide information, but to be diligent,

reasonably, in ascertaining that information, and the 

constructive knowledge standard really came to address a 

case different from the case that we have here, Justice 

Sotomayor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But I -- it sounds 

right, but give me a practical -- give me a practical 

example --

MR. FREDERICK: Sure. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- of what you are 

talking about, where -- where an individual investor 

would have something that's not in the public domain. 

MR. FREDERICK: That would be information 

that the -- the broker, for instance, would have made 

available to the investor, that the investor simply 

didn't look at, or that the investor could have asked 

for, but -- but never followed up in obtaining. 

And that kind of constructive knowledge 

standard, this Court has held in numerous cases, dating 

back to the 19th century, is an appropriate form of 

attributing knowledge to a reasonable person. 

And the cases that we’ve cited in our brief 

-- Kirby, Wood -- those kinds of cases talk about what a 

reasonable person in those kinds of circumstances would 

be imputed to know. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well -- but actual

knowledge would include anything the investor had in 

their possession because that's what actual knowledge 

is; I have it in my possession -- or I have it in the 

public domain. You start it from there. 

MR. FREDERICK: Correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The -- the only 

difference then would be information the individual 

would have been able to get that wouldn't have been in 

the public domain? 

MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, through 

reasonable inquiry, that by following up with questions 

to the broker or to other persons associated with that 

entity. It's a different theory, concededly, Justice 

Sotomayor, in a fraud-on-the-market case, which is what 

this case is. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- so we are in 

agreement that on a fraud-on-the-market case, it might 

have a different -- they would be identical? 

MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, and --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are suggesting that, 

in an individual fraud case, the inquiry has to be 

constructive knowledge because there could be things 

that --

MR. FREDERICK: It could be actual or 

constructive, depending on the facts and circumstances,

but the important point to draw away from this is that 

Congress also wrote in a 5-year period of repose in 

this statute and followed up on the suggestion of the 

Lampf dissenters, who believed that the period of repose 

was too restrictive. 

So, in 2002, when Congress amended the 

statute, they cited the Lampf dissenters and extended 

the period of repose, which created an absolute bar to 

claims of fraud being brought against defendants. 

The statute of limitations period -- by 

using a discovery rule -- was intended to preclude 

persons from resting on their rights and not taking 

action when they had discovered the facts constituting 

the violation. It was not intended --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But when does the –- when 

does the 5-year -- what is the trigger for the 

5-year period? 

MR. FREDERICK: From the violation. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what is the 

violation? 

MR. FREDERICK: The violation would be a 

material misstatement made with scienter. And, here, 

what we assert in the class period, Justice Ginsburg, is 

that the first statements that were made with scienter 

were those statements after Vioxx was put on the market,

in which Merck touted the naproxen hypothesis as an 

explanation for what it asserted to be a cardio-neutral 

effect of Vioxx, which was only subsequently -- there 

was empirical evidence to -- tending to disprove that 

thesis. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you say that 

you did -- you did begin this action even before that 

point was reached because you -- you attribute this to 

the disclosure of the internal e-mails in the Wall 

Street Journal article? 

So you -- you say, well, we sued even 

earlier than -- than the point at which we had evidence 

of scienter. 

MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. Under 

our theory of the case, the period of constructive 

knowledge of all of the elements of the violation would 

have occurred in November of 2004 with the publication 

of The Wall Street Journal article. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you are admitting 

that you filed an improper complaint, that you didn't 

have a basis -- a good faith basis for the complaint you 

filed? 

MR. FREDERICK: No. I'm saying --

possession that gave you that good faith basis? 

MR. FREDERICK: First, let me say that the 

first complaint is now a legal nullity. It has been 

superseded by --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I -- whether 

it's a legal nullity or not, answer my question which 

is: You had to have a basis for your complaint. What 

was in your possession or in the public possession that 

gave you that basis? 

MR. FREDERICK: Shortly before the filing of 

the first complaint, there were public releases of a 

study that was done by the Harvard Brigham and Women's 

study, and that was a large epidemiological study that 

was the first empirical basis that disproved an aspect 

of the naproxen hypothesis. 

Naproxen was not a drug studied at that 

time. But what the study showed was that Vioxx and 

Celebrex users had a higher rate of cardiovascular 

incidents, and, in fact, Vioxx had higher than Celebrex. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't prove 

scienter, though. 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, to an investor who was 

following this information, that very well may have led 

to a strong inference of scienter because of the 

vociferous denials that Merck subsequently made to a

study that was publicly reported as being funded by a 

Merck grant. 

Now, whether that would have met a 

post-Tellabs pleading standard, we will not know because 

that was not subject to that kind of scrutiny. We’re 

here on a subsequent, superseding complaint that pleads 

those allegations, and we’re here on a statute of 

limitations argument in which Merck attempts to argue 

that the suit was filed too late, rather than too early. 

Obviously --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Judge Sloviter used 

the so-called Harvard study, it seems, in her opinion. 

She thought that that was the point at which you had 

enough to suspect scienter. 

MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. But, of 

course, at that time, Justice Ginsburg, the case wasn't 

about the pleading standards for scienter of the first 

complaint. 

It had long since gone past that, and the 

fourth and now the fifth amended complaint, which 

Merck acceded to its filing in the district court after 

certiorari was granted in this case is now the operative 

complaint, and I would submit that the allegations well-

established the pleading standards for scienter. 

Of course, that’s not an issue before the

Court, and the question of whether the first complaint 

was premature is also not before the Court. But the 

fact that there is constructive knowledge only on the 

basis of new information that came to light is relevant 

because Merck cannot point to a single fact that came 

out between the FDA warning letter and the file -- and 

2 years before the filing of the first complaint, so 

that narrow window between September 2001 and 

November 6, 2001. 

And, in fact, when the FDA expanded the uses 

of Vioxx in April 2002, it approved a label that 

specifically addressed the uncertainty about the 

naproxen hypothesis. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Now, your -- your 

position is that the statute begins to run at the time 

when a -- a plaintiff is -- has constructive knowledge, 

at least, of information that would be sufficient to 

file a complaint that would satisfy the PLRA? 

MR. FREDERICK: That’s correct. That was 

the general rule, prior to 1934, when Congress first 

wrote those words into the Federal statute. 

But, Justice Alito, we have also provided 

information to the Court of a case in the 19th century 

called Martin -- this is on page 25 of our brief -- in 

which the standard was seen to be somewhat lower than

reasonable person would have believed that he had been 

subject to fraud. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, my question -- why, 

then, did Congress allow 2 years after that? At that 

point, the plaintiff has everything that’s necessary to 

file a complaint. So why does the plaintiff need 2 

years after that point? 

MR. FREDERICK: In the legislative reports 

that accompany the Act in 2002, what the Senate 

described in its report was a concern that a 1-year 

period would be too short for a plaintiff to file an 

action, survive a motion to dismiss, and then gain 

discovery about the possibility of other codefendants 

who had participated in that fraud. 

This was the era, Justice Alito, in which 

Enron and WorldCom exposed to the world the complexity 

of vast and difficult-to-ascertain frauds, and Congress 

was seeking to extend that period so that investors 

would have an opportunity responsibly to bring cases 

that would ferret out that fraud and to get at all of 

the people who might have participated in that fraud. 

That was the explanation that the -- the 

Senate gave for that, and that couples with the action 

by Congress in the PSLRA, which was intended to ensure

that these pleading standards would be well investigated 

and well ferreted out prior to pleadings. The 2-year 

period was intended to ensure that that kind of action 

would -- would take place. 

And when you couple that with the 5-year 

statute of repose, the statute of limitations is simply 

an -- an insurance that a plaintiff is not resting too 

far on information within its possession when the 

statute of repose is going to provide absolute 

protection. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So, is there a difference 

-- I'm trying to get these terminological differences 

clear in my mind, and I'm not quite certain of the 

difference between you and the government. 

If you go back to my -- my Burma example, I 

think both you and the government agree that the statute 

doesn't begin to run until you find this person in 

Burma. But now, I'm not sure you disagree about --

whether you agree or disagree about this. So I think --

you find the person in Burma. That’s 6 months after 

you had all the other indications. Now, both of you say 

the statute begins to run. You would say, when you 

find that person in Burma, you have to get, through him, 

enough information to be able to file your complaint now 

in respect to scienter.

MR. FREDERICK: I don't believe so. I 

believe --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there no difference, 

then, between the two of you, or what? 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, the difference -- here 

is the difference: We accept that the pleading standard 

rule advocated by the government is the brightest line 

rule and that this Court should adopt it. If it adopts 

something less than that and adopts a reasonable 

person’s believing that fraud had occurred, that might 

not quite meet the pleading standards, but would 

nonetheless encapsulate the laws that existed prior to 

1934, and we would prevail under that standard, too. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So do you think --

you think the standard should be -- and I can find out 

from the government, and I will, I guess -- that it 

should be -- that you have to -- a reasonable person 

having talked to the guy in Burma would walk away 

thinking, Fraud. 

That's the standard; you think they’re both there --

MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So you both agree about 

that? 

MR. FREDERICK: We do agree on that. And 

the difference is that if you talk to the person in 

Burma, Justice Breyer, you may not get enough facts to 

get a PSLRA-compliant pleading on file, but you might 

have the belief that a fraud had occurred. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so you want to say, 

you ought to get enough information from that or in all 

the other things the same, so that you have -- are able 

to file the complaint. They want to say you have to get 

enough so a reasonable person would believe a fraud had 

occurred. Is that right? 

MR. FREDERICK: No. Our position is that 

the pleading standard is correct, and that if you don't 

adopt a pleading standard, something a little bit less 

than a pleading standard -- their standard -- is that --

not so worried about that. I know there's a lot less,

MR. FREDERICK: The difference -- the space 

between our the position and the government is really 

quite small, and it rests on pre-1934 interpretations of 

“discovery of the facts constituting” that did not seem 

to tie specifically to pleading standards, but 

nonetheless adopted a reasonable person standard based 

on what a reasonable person would have believed that 

fraud had occurred. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, before you 

-- you've finished, there’s something puzzling about 

the Third Circuit decision, and it's that Judge Sloviter 

says at the end, in summary, "We conclude that the 

district court acted prematurely." She doesn't seem to 

close off a statute of limitations defense. 

It's -- and the same thing on page 48a, 

footnote 17. She says, this -- her conclusion is, "At 

this stage of the evidence" -- she doesn't say that the 

district court was wrong in saying that the limitation 

period -- in its judgment about the limitation period 

having expired. She just said it was premature. 

What -- what did she mean by that? 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, this was brought as a 

motion to dismiss, Justice Ginsburg. Most times, a 

statute of limitations defense, which is an affirmative 

defense that the defendants have the burden to show --

most often they are brought as motions for summary 

judgment, in which there are undisputed facts that the

Here, I think what the Third Circuit was 

holding was that, this is not proper as a motion to 

dismiss and deny it as a motion to dismiss. But there -

- it is routine in the law that where there are motions 

to dismiss, there subsequently are facts developed and 

subsequent pleadings brought. I don't think that the 

court was saying anything other than, this is the normal 

course in which motions to dismiss which should not have 

been granted would be allowed for further percolation by 

the case --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it does seem to me 

that even if we adopt your theory of the case, there is 

some problem with the allegation that there was fraud, 

because Vioxx did not -- because Merck did not disclose 

that the hypothesis was only hypothetical, and the FDA 

August letter made that clear. So it seems to me you 

may have a problem as to that aspect of the case. 

MR. FREDERICK: I don’t think so --

we would parse that out up here.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, well, you mean we 

have to look to see how the analysts react? 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, that was part of the 

factual inquiry that Merck itself submitted as part of 

its motion to dismiss. Whether the Court treats that as 

relevant for ascertaining at this time whether to 

affirm the Third Circuit, I don't think the Court needs 

to reach, but I would point out that our brief goes into 

this in quite some detail, that the publicly available 

information made clear there was absolutely no market 

reaction that would have led any person reasonably to 

suspect that Merck did not honestly believe the naproxen 

hypothesis that it were positing at the time. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you think there 

was, because you filed suit a month after that study in 

2003. 

MR. FREDERICK: To be sure, subsequently 

information came to light that brought Merck's very 

serious fraud to public attention. And on the basis of 

that very serious fraud that had significant adverse 

consequences to investors, we have brought suit. 

But it would be the height of irony that for

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART, 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. STEWART: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

By its terms, section 1658(b)(1) provides 

that the 2-year period of limitations will commence to 

run upon discovery of the facts constituting the 

violation. In isolation, the word "discovery" could 

refer either to actual or constructive discovery. 

Between the period of the time of this Court's decision 

in Lampf and the enactment of the new limitations period 

in 2002, all of the courts of appeals had concluded that 

constructive discovery would suffice, and we believe 

that Congress's enactment of the statute tracking that 

language constitutes acquiescence in that view. 

Nevertheless, it's noteworthy that the

statute refers to facts constituting the violation, and 

it's absolutely essential to this Court's section 10(b) 

jurisprudence that can there be no 10(b) violation 

without scienter. Scienter is an essential element of 

the offense, and the coverage of section 10(b) would be 

dramatically expanded if it were read to cover innocent 

mistakes. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Was there also a substantial 

support in the lower court case law prior to the 

enactment of this provision for the existence of inquiry 

notice? And is that therefore also incorporated into 

this? 

MR. STEWART: There were certainly frequent 

references to the concept of inquiry notice. There was 

not uniformity among the courts of appeals as to 

precisely what role inquiry notice would play in the 

analysis. 

The majority of the courts of appeals 

believed as we believe that inquiry notice is a 

subsidiary step along the way to determining when a 

reasonable plaintiff would have actually discovered the 

facts constituting the violation. And so you look first 

to see when would a reasonable person have become 

suspicious, and then you ask: Once the reasonable 

person's suspicions were aroused, how long would it take

to complete the investigation and have actual knowledge? 

And that’s consistent with our view. 

There certainly were courts that adopted 

Petitioners' view that the statute began to run at the 

time of inquiry notice, at the time suspicions were 

aroused. 

JUSTICE ALITO: But, under your position, as 

-- the concept of inquiry notice becomes essentially 

very unimportant, if not completely meaningless. You 

just ask at what point would a reasonably diligent 

investor have obtained knowledge of the necessary facts. 

And so, what difference does it make when a person was 

put on inquiry notice? 

MR. STEWART: Well, I think it is -- I 

think you are right that that is the ultimate question 

for the Court: When would a reasonably diligent person 

have obtained actual knowledge? The concept of inquiry 

notice can be a useful subsidiary step, because even 

once it has been established -- for instance, there are 

many cases of this Court in which the plaintiff's 

failure to exercise reasonable diligence consisted of 

the failure to look at documents that were available in 

public records offices or corporate records that were 

open for inspection. 

And in that situation, once you identify the

point at which a reasonably diligent plaintiff would 

have commenced to look, there won't be a very long gap 

in time before the reasonably diligent plaintiff would 

have found what he was looking for. And in that 

situation, it's really integral to identify the point of 

inquiry notice, the point at which the plaintiff would 

have started looking. 

Now, the fact that inquiry notice is not the 

be-all and end-all shouldn't be surprising, because it's 

a term that doesn't appear in the statute. And so the 

fact that it ultimately plays a subsidiary role in 

undertaking the ultimate --

JUSTICE BREYER: So how -- how -- what's the 

right phrasing? Because I -- I understood that inquiry 

notice has somehow made an appearance, and it seems to 

confuse me. So you say the statute begins to run when 

a reasonable person would have found facts sufficient to 

show a violation or sufficient to permit him to file a 

complaint that alleges a violation? How -- does that 

come in any way? 

MR. STEWART: Yes, we -- under our --

JUSTICE BREYER: How do I say that here? 

MR. STEWART: Under our standard, the -- the 

individual would have knowledge of facts constituting 

the violation once he had facts sufficient that if -- if

JUSTICE BREYER: So you are basically in 

agreement. And then the way that the -- the -- then the 

way that this inquiry thing comes in is that 

sometimes, perhaps quite often, a reasonable person, 

given certain facts, would begin to inquire. 

MR. STEWART: That's correct. And --

JUSTICE BREYER: And if it happened to be a 

case where inquiry played no role, then it wouldn't. 

It's all a question of what a reasonable person would 

do.

discover it, when they have constructive discovery,

MR. STEWART: Well, inquiry notice is -- in 

many instances, identifying the point of inquiry notice 

is often essential to identifying the point at which a 

reasonable person would have discovered the facts that 

would support a well-pleaded complaint. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand 

that. 

MR. STEWART: For instance, suppose it was 

common ground that there were records available in an 

admittedly obscure public records office, and that a 

plaintiff, once he started to conduct an investigation, 

would find those records within a week. We still 

wouldn't know the point at which a reasonably diligent 

plaintiff should have found those records until we could 

first determine when would a reasonably diligent 

plaintiff have started looking, and that would be the 

point of inquiry notice. And so, it might be that at a 

certain point, the plaintiff had --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, and maybe –-

and maybe it turns out that you could find them within a 

week and maybe it turns out you could find them within 3 

months or when the fellow from Burma is released, but in 

either case, it’s when they discover it or should have 

discovered it.

also knew the date on which the reasonably diligent

about this particular case. Does the inquiry notice 

contribute anything to answering the question when this

would a reasonably diligent investor have discovered 

sufficient facts to file a well-pleaded complaint? 

Now, constructive discovery does still play 

a role, because if there was information in the public 

domain, but a particular investor simply didn't read 

news reports, didn't follow even public information 

about the -- the nature of what was going on with Vioxx, 

that person wouldn't be shielded from the running of the 

limitations period simply because he didn't have actual 

knowledge. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Why does the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And, Mr. Stewart, the --

you said -- the phrase that you used were “facts 

constituting the alleged violation,” and the other side 

says, well, look at the Court's Tellabs opinion: That 

described as discrete (1) facts constituting an alleged 

violation -- which you say is the test -- and (2) facts 

evidencing scienter. 

MR. STEWART: And I think if you read 

Tellabs as a construction of this statute, it would be 

inconsistent with our view. But the Tellabs Court was 

talking about something else. It was construing the 

heightened pleading requirements of the PSLRA. 

Now, the PSLRA pleading requirements do 

distinguish, in adjacent subsections, between the

requirement that a plaintiff plead with particularity 

the specific statements that are alleged to be false or 

misleading and the reason that they are false and 

misleading, on the one hand -- that’s in subsection (1) 

-- and then, in subsection (2), it requires also to be 

pleaded with particularity the facts that establish 

strong inference of scienter. 

And the Court in Tellabs used the term 

"facts constituting the violation" as a shorthand 

reference to that subsection (1); namely, you have to 

plead with particularity facts about the alleged 

misstatement and why it’s misleading. 

The statute itself, the PSLRA, does not use 

the term "facts constituting the violation" to describe 

the first category. And the word "violation" as applied 

to 10(b) naturally encompasses both what the defendant 

did and what his state of mind was. 

The other thing we would say -- two other 

things we would say in that regard are, first, as the 

introductory language of section 1658(b) 

points out, this limitations period only applies to 

suits in which the plaintiff alleges misconduct 

involving fraud, deceit, manipulation, or contrivance. 

And so, the limitations period is limited 

to violations that have scienter as an element. And,

therefore, it would be particularly peculiar to think of 

a violation as not encompassing the fact of scienter. 

The other thing we would say -- and Justice 

Scalia was asking earlier about the differences between 

78i(e) and 77m -- and there are really too salient 

differences. The first is that 77m is explicit in 

providing that constructive as well as actual discovery 

will suffice. And we think that 1658(b)(1) is properly 

read to encompass constructive discovery, even though 

it doesn't say so in so many words. 

But the other salient difference is that the 

period in 77m doesn't commence to run by its terms upon 

discovery of the violation or the facts constituting the 

violation. The statute says discovery of the false or 

misleading statement or omission. That's natural in 

77m, because 77m deals with violations that don't 

have scienter as an element. But if this Court had 

incorporated that language, it would have given the 

impression that knowledge of scienter was not 

sufficient -- was not required.

Mr. Chief Justice. 

A narrow issue before the Court in this 

case is whether a plaintiff must possess information 

specifically relating to scienter in order to be on 

inquiry notice. And really under any standard for 

inquiry notice, there was abundant information in the 

public domain as of 2001 at least suggesting the 

possibility that Petitioners in this case had engaged in 

securities fraud. 

Now, my brothers don't really dispute that 

proposition. Instead, they really advance two other 

options for interpreting section 1658(b), under which 

the concept of inquiry notice, the well-established 

concept of inquiry notice, really has no role. 

My friend Mr. Frederick suggested, at least 

in cases involving alleged fraud on the market, that the 

standard really should be an actual discovery standard. 

But no court of appeals has adopted that interpretation 

of section 1658(b), and as a practical matter that would 

dramatically lengthen the limitations period for private 

securities fraud actions. 

And it is no answer to say that Congress's 

inclusion of a statute of repose makes everything okay. 

We would respectfully submit that the inclusion of the 

statute of repose suggests that Congress was simply

Congress in no way intended to modify the traditional 

operation of the discovery rule. 

With regard to the suggestion that the Court 

should simply adopt a constructive discovery rule that 

pays no heed to inquiry notice, which is the standard 

that the government seems to be advancing, I think, 

first of all, Respondents' difficulty in coming up with 

a date on which constructive discovery occurs in this 

case simply illustrates the problem that would be 

multiplied a hundredfold if that standard is applied 

nationwide. 

And where a statute of limitations is 

concerned, one needs to have clear rules and rules that 

courts can easily apply without inconsistency. I do 

think that that rule would also lead to abuse. It would 

lead to the abuse of the ostrich plaintiff who simply 

lies in wait and waits to see how a company's stock 

performs before bringing suit. 

And make no mistake about it: That is what 

precisely happened in this case. By counsel for 

Respondents' own admission in the district court, the 

filing of the lawsuit in 2003, before the withdrawal of 

Vioxx from the market, was triggered by a disappointing

Official 

earnings report that led to a decline in the stock 

price. And one can expect that that phenomenon will be 

multiplied if such a hypothetical plaintiff inquiry is 

adopted. 

In this case, there was abundant information 

in the public domain by virtue of the FDA warning letter 

and other sources as of 2001. The plaintiffs in this 

case conducted no investigation at that point. And this 

Court's cases --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: As long as the stock 

price was holding, how was the plaintiff injured? 

MR. SHANMUGAM: The plaintiff may not have 

suffered an injury by that point, but it is clear that 

section 1658(b) refers to the facts constituting a 

violation of section 10(b), not all of the elements of a 

private cause of action. So Congress itself 

contemplated the possibility that the limitations period 

could begin to run before the loss occurred. 

And if I can just say one thing about this 

Court's cases concerning the discovery rule, I 

respectfully disagree with my friend Mr. Frederick. 

This Court's cases make clear that a plaintiff must 

exercise reasonable diligence in order to take advantage 

of the discovery rule. Indeed, recently in Klehr in the 

context of civil RICO, this Court held that a plaintiff

must exercise reasonable diligence even to invoke the 

doctrine of fraudulent concealment. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If it's true that 

everything was locked up internally at Merck, all the 

reasonable diligence in the world would not have 

uncovered what eventually came out. 

MR. SHANMUGAM: And under our approach, if a 

plaintiff comes forward and shows that the plaintiff 

exercised reasonable diligence but was unable to 

discover any remaining information, the plaintiff will 

have the benefit of additional time. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
