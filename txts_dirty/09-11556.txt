 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next this morning in Case 09-11556, Tolentino 

v. New York.

 Ms. Schwarz.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KRISTINA SCHWARZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. SCHWARZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Court held in Delaware v. Prouse that, 

in the absence of reasonable suspicion, it is an 

unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment for 

police to stop a car for the purpose of checking the 

motorist's driving credentials.

 In Brown v. Texas, the Court similarly ruled 

that police may not stop a person without reasonable 

suspicion for the purpose of requiring the individual to 

identify him or herself. These cases are grounded in 

the principle that in this country we enjoy the right to 

go about our business free from government interference 

unless or until the police have just cause to detain us.

 Petitioner's motion to suppress alleged that 

the police acted exactly as they did in Prouse and 

Brown. They stopped the car without justification,

elicited his name, and gained access to his DMV records, 

which otherwise would not have been discovered. Instead 

of suppressing the poisonous fruit of the illegal car 

stop, the DMV records, the New York Court of Appeals 

chose to create a new categorical rule that prevents 

application of the exclusionary rule whenever the police 

act in violation of Prouse.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was -- was -- was the 

poisonous fruit the DMV records, or was the poisonous 

fruit the fact that this person who is contained in the 

records was the one driving the car? Why wasn't that 

the -- why wasn't that the fruit? I mean, the records 

were there anyway. What -- what -- what new information 

came from the stop was the fact that that is the person 

who was driving the car. Why -- why didn't -- why 

wasn't that what should have been suppressed?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, Justice Scalia, that is 

also a fruit of the poisonous tree. As -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I would agree with you on 

that fruit. Did -- did you ask for that to be 

suppressed?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Yes, that was asked for in the 

-- in the motion at the trial level. In addition -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not what's 

before us here, right?

MS. SCHWARZ: That's right, and that's 

because the court below decided that -- in deciding the 

case only addressed the DMV record, and -- and indicated 

that the DMV records were not properly suppressible 

fruit.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that the -­

MS. SCHWARZ: And that's the issue.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that -- that you had 

won at the trial level; the judge suppresses everything 

and dismisses the indictment; and Mr. Tolentino walks 

out of the courtroom and is observed by the officer that 

conducted the stop in this case. The officer sees him 

getting into a car and driving away, even though his 

license is still suspended. Now, could -- could he be 

arrested for that?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Yes, Justice Alito, he could.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Even though the officer 

would have no reason to know that this particular person 

has a suspended license were it not for the chain of 

events that followed from the initial allegedly illegal 

stop?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, although that initial 

stop provided the tainted information that he didn't 

have a license, the subsequent re- offense would 

certainly taint the -- the illegality of the first stop

and make the second offense properly -­

JUSTICE ALITO: All right. Let me ask a 

related question. Suppose that after you filed your 

suppression motion the -- the State of New York became 

nervous about this issue and they checked all the 

surveillance cameras in the vicinity of the stop, and, 

lo and behold, they found a tape showing Mr. Tolentino 

driving the car shortly before the stop here. Could he 

be prosecuted for illegal -- for driving without a 

license, with a suspended license, using that evidence?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, that -- I believe that 

under those circumstances it would be entirely proper to 

prosecute the case. With that, that would be evidence 

that came from an independent source.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I mean, in light of 

those two answers, it does seem to me that your real 

problem here is not with the -- the DMV records. It's 

with the police officer's observation after the stop 

that Mr. Tolentino was driving the car.

 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, Justice Alito, again, 

all of -- there's lots of evidence that could be 

properly the fruit of the poisonous tree. There was a 

statement made here that the Petitioner said that he did 

not have a New York State license, there's the 

observations of the officer, and there's the DMV

records. They're all properly considered fruit, and in 

this case the DMV records are of important evidentiary 

significance.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there any 

case in this Court where what was suppressed was 

information that was lawfully in the government's 

possession, as opposed to evidence that was acquired 

originally through the search? Here we have the DMV 

records, they're public records. I don't know of any 

decision of this Court that deals with suppression of 

evidence that is already in the government's possession, 

and if I'm wrong about that, you tell me.

 MS. SCHWARZ: Yes. Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I 

don't believe there has been precedent on that issue. 

However, in the independent source doctrine cases, there 

-- they've always required that the possession -- or 

that they have knowledge of the information in order for 

it to defeat the exclusionary rule application. So in 

this case, although the government had the DMV records 

-- well, first of all, law enforcement didn't have the 

DMV records. It was only until the illegality and the 

exploitation of that illegality that they acquired the 

records from the Department of Motor Vehicles. So in 

that sense it was clearly a fruit of the poisonous tree.

 But even if you look at government as an

integrated whole, the prior possession of the -- the 

records was meaningless, of no value to them, until the 

illegality when it acquired its meaning.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the police 

following Mr. Tolentino had noted down his license 

plate, and then got this information, not as a result of 

his driver's license, but from the plate on the car?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the -­

the -- the plates of the car would not indicate the -­

the driver's license of the driver, and in this case Mr. 

Tolentino -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They might show him as 

the owner of the car.

 MS. SCHWARZ: The owner of the car. And I 

believe in Respondent's brief they indicated that -­

that some of the police computers will even show 

descriptive features or maybe even a picture of the 

driver. But in this case Mr. Tolentino was not the 

registered owner of the vehicle, so that wouldn't have 

provided them with cause to pull the car over.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: This -- this goes back to 

a question Justice Alito asked in a probably more artful 

way, but I'm not quite sure what's supposed to happen 

under your view after this stop. They stop the person, 

they get the information that he's driving under a

suspended license, and are they supposed to say, Oh, you 

know, we shouldn't have stopped you; I'm sorry, have a 

nice day, go ahead, and then he leaves? Is that what 

goes on?

 MS. SCHWARZ: No, Justice Kennedy, that's 

not what would happen. The State would impound the car. 

They would not allow a -- a person without a proper 

license to get back in the car and -- and drive on. 

That -- in order for the Petitioner to get the vehicle 

back, he would -- if it was his vehicle -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why isn't impounding 

the car the fruit of the illegal search?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Because the -- the impoundment 

statutes are based on a public safety interest, and so 

it doesn't -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But why doesn't the public 

safety interest then permit us to use this evidence in 

order to protect the public safety further by punishing 

him for -- not driving? I don't see the difference.

 MS. SCHWARZ: Because in order to do that, 

it would be tantamount to sanctioning a -- a fishing 

expedition in this case, Justice Kennedy, because it 

would be allowing the police without reasonable 

suspicion -­

the same thing about impounding the car?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Because the -- the -- the 

interests are different and because it's not a forever 

removal of the Petitioner's right to get the car, 

whoever the -- the rightful owner is. It's just making 

sure that the Petitioner can't get back in the car and 

continue driving. In order to get the vehicle back, at 

least in New York State, the -- if it was the 

Petitioner's, they would have to show proof that they 

had a valid license; and if it wasn't his vehicle, then 

the other -- the true owner would have to get -- provide 

proper credentials to establish that they could take the 

-- the vehicle into their possession; and also they 

would have to have proof that the Petitioner himself had 

cleared up his record or get some sort of a -- a release 

from the court or from the district attorney's office. 

So the whole purpose of that impoundment statute is for 

public safety.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand the 

answer you gave to Justice Alito. Maybe I mixed it up. 

The police stop the car without cause.

 MS. SCHWARZ: Uh-huh.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So illegal stop. And you 

say as a result of the stop they found out all these 

things in the records, that he had no license, right?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now the 

question I had heard put was, suppose after they got 

this information, they don't arrest him then, but he 

gets into the car again and starts driving. You said 

then they could arrest him?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Well -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? Why? Why 

isn't -- why isn't that just as much the fruit of the 

poisonous tree? They found out he doesn't have a 

license by the record which came to them from an illegal 

stop. I just don't understand it. Did I get you right 

as to what you said?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Justice Breyer, what I -- what 

I meant to say is the attenuation doctrine would apply. 

Now, if the person was -- got back in his car 

immediately at that scene and started off driving, then 

I'm not sure that the attenuation doctrine would -­

would -- would kick in.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So therefore they couldn't 

arrest him. So what they do is they -- is that right?

JUSTICE BREYER: They see -- they see he -­

they stopped him, they get the records, wrongly. They 

see he has no license. He says: How did you know? 

Because we just looked at your license. That was 

illegal; good-bye, gets into the car and drives off, and 

they can do nothing?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Except I just have to remind 

you that they -- they could -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right or not? Is 

that right?

 MS. SCHWARZ: -- impound the car.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I -- how could they --­

they can impound the car.

 MS. SCHWARZ: Impound the car.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Because?

 MS. SCHWARZ: So -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Because?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Because of the statutory 

rights, the Court -- because they now know that he has 

no license to drive, so either the car will -- if 

there's another person who can properly take possession 

of the vehicle, then that person can drive off with the 

car. But the Petitioner himself, who doesn't have a 

valid license, he can't get back in the car.

JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm sorry.

 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, I'm done.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Schwarz, suppose the 

police arrest the guy, find out who he is, don't -- stop 

the guy, find out who he is, don't arrest him, but then 

now they know that this is the kind of guy who drives 

without a license. And so they go to his house the next 

day and they see him getting back in the car. Could 

they arrest him then?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Justice Kagan, I think the 

answer would be yes, and the reason why is because if 

they see him on a subsequent occasion and they're seeing 

him re-offend, that would attenuate the taint of the 

first -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: So the re-offense -- the 

re-offense just cuts off the original taint?

 MS. SCHWARZ: I believe so, yes. I mean, it 

would be attenuation analysis, but to me it would be 

pretty clear-cut that that's how it would resolve.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the only way that 

the police can prevent an unlicensed driver from driving 

in this situation is to take away his car? Impound the 

car, as you say?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Well -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Unless they want -­

for any offense, you know, expired driver's license. 

Expired last week. They can't just give the guy -- they 

can't give the guy a ticket, right? All they can do is 

take away his car?

 Your answer to a number of the questions has 

been that -- that have tried to address the issue of 

what are they supposed to do, since they know they have 

somebody who is violating the law, is that, well, they 

can take away the car. And I just want to know if 

that's the only permissible response by the police when 

they know that the person driving has violated the law.

 MS. SCHWARZ: If the -- if the stop was -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Totally illegal.

 MS. SCHWARZ: -- Totally illegal -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Totally, yes.

 MS. SCHWARZ: Then I don't think that -- if 

there were -- I don't think that they could prosecute 

that case. They could -- they couldn't charge him with 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the only way to 

prevent him from reoffending immediately is to impound 

the car? Because if he gets into the car and drives, 

then -- or can the police arrest him right away?

attenuation analysis. But I think that the taint of the 

initial illegality would make that a much more difficult 

case. But in that situation, the police also could -­

again, if there was another person who had authority to 

take possession of the vehicle, that person could take 

the vehicle, the registered owner or someone with 

authority to do that. But the police would not be 

powerless to see the defendant get back in the -- in the 

car.

 I mean, it would -- that would be -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why not? Why 

wouldn't they -­

MS. SCHWARZ: Because of the impoundment 

statutes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that your answer, 

then: They've got to impound the car every time or let 

the guy just go?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, they -- they could drive 

the person home to his house or take him to the corner 

or tell him not to drive until he cleared up his 

license. They could do that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They could tell him 

not to drive until he clears up his license?

 MS. SCHWARZ: I -- yes. I mean, that would 

be another alternative.

But the scenario that you are talking about 

would be highly unlikely, and it would be almost in bad 

faith if the police stopped him illegally, found out 

that he had the suspended license, and then let him get 

back in right away. That wouldn't be the way that the 

police would normally do that, unless there was a way to 

properly maintain the safety of the road -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How much time do they 

have to wait? Justice Kagan brought up if the police go 

to his home the next day. You've brought up attenuation 

theory a number of times.

 MS. SCHWARZ: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- I think now you 

have answered, he gets back into the car, drives it 

away, they can do nothing because it's too close to when 

they discovered his record of -- his suspended license.

 How much of an interval must there be? What 

do you mean by attenuation doctrine?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, that would be -­

attenuation would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, 

Justice Ginsburg, but I would think if, even an hour 

later, if the Petitioner brazenly drove by those same 

officers, you know, thumbing his nose at them, hi, that 

would be -- attenuation analysis would apply at that 

point.

JUSTICE KAGAN: Because you could say that 

if he got back in the car right after the stop, if the 

police for some reason did not impound the car and he 

got back in the car, that's another offense, and so by 

your theory, then they could properly arrest him and use 

all of this knowledge in a prosecution?

 MS. SCHWARZ: And a court very well -- very 

well may agree with you on that. My only qualm with 

that is that when the officers illegally find out that 

he has a suspended license and then to let him get back 

in and immediately arrest him, it's sort of in bad 

faith.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what -- what is that 

word, the "bad faith"? I take it your rule is identical 

if when they wrongly stop the car, they look up the 

records, the records say he has no license, and in 

addition, he's wanted on 17 drug warrants and for 3 

triple axe murders. Again, you can't do anything about 

it?

 MS. SCHWARZ: No. No, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What? Can you? You cannot 

do anything about it or you can?

 MS. SCHWARZ: You can.

entirely different -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Why?

 MS. SCHWARZ: -- because of the Ker-Frisbie 

doctrine. The warrants for -- for other cases are a 

method by which the court brings the body of the 

defendant to court. And so there is -­

JUSTICE BREYER: So if, in fact, a policeman 

stops a person without cause and learns as a result of 

that that there are many warrants outstanding against 

him, he then can arrest the person, and -- but can he 

introduce those warrants into court as evidence or 

whatever if it's relevant?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Absolutely, he can bring them 

in. But the warrants are not evidentiary.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose the way that the 

policeman stops the person and gets the information 

illegally is he takes an axe and breaks into the house, 

the policeman, and thereby -- what I'm showing -- I just 

think this case has lots of implications, and I'm 

looking for a rule here that's going to work in a lot of 

different situations.

 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, there's -- actually, I'm 

sorry, Justice Breyer, I'm not sure I follow.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you say that if, in 

fact, he learns that this man from the public records is

MS. SCHWARZ: Right.

it, I said? And you said no, he can do something about 

it. I just wanted to know the distinction.

 MS. SCHWARZ: Okay. So there's different -­

again, just to be clear, the warrant, the arrest 

warrant, is not of evidentiary value, according to 

the -- Davis. That's not something that would be 

introduced in court. It's just a method for bringing 

the defendant into court. And so in that case, they 

would properly be allowed to arrest him. And if there 

was -­

JUSTICE BREYER: It happens to be a 

description of the individual, not a warrant, he gets 

from the public record which is read off to him when he 

calls in, a description: A red tie. Can he use that 

and introduce it into evidence?

 I mean, is this case about -- what's it 

about, driving? Or does it have broader implications?

 I thought that the Court had held that any 

public record at all is immune. Is that right? Immune 

from the normal fruit of the poisonous tree rule.

 MS. SCHWARZ: The New York Court of Appeals 

rule categorically removes it, that's true.

the -­

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, not an incorrect 

rule, the opposite rule. No rule.

 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, it's -- the problem with 

that rule, the categorical rule, is that it will create 

a fresh incentive for police officers to make these kind 

of suspicionless stops, and so it will encourage police 

to violate the Fourth Amendment, and not only -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not if you allow the 

suppression of the policeman's identification of the 

individual driving the car. I mean, that -- nobody's 

contending that that can't be suppressed. So if you 

can't bring in the policeman to say, yes, this fellow 

Smith, whose record we have here, was the fellow driving 

the car. Once that's out, what incentive is there to 

make these suspicionless stops?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Because -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: What I'm saying is, you're 

getting at it from the wrong end. What should have been 

suppressed was the policeman's identification of the 

person who was driving the car.

MS. SCHWARZ: Ah. Yes. And if -- and if 

this case -- if this case -- we prevail, and this case 

was returned to trial court, both of those issues would 

be at play and would be litigated. The observations of 

the defendant and the DMV records are both suppressible 

fruit and both of them would be subject to suppression.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But that's not the argument 

you seem to be making. You want to suppress the 

knowledge that the police derived from the stop that 

Mr. Tolentino's license is suspended, and you would 

allow an exception to that only if there was 

attenuation. But why isn't the simpler solution to a 

case like this that you can't suppress the knowledge of 

matters that are in a government record, however you can 

suppress observations by the police on the scene that 

flow directly from the illegal stop?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, again, our position is 

that both of those items are properly suppressible. And 

it's true in this circumstance that the observations 

would probably subsume the need for the DMV records. 

However, the observations may not be sufficient in 

certain circumstances. And in those cases, it would be 

more important -- it would be very important to have 

both of the items suppressible, and there's no reason, 

there's not -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was some 

rule about not being able to suppress a person's 

identity? You've been asked a couple of times why are 

you going after the DMV record; you should go after the 

police identification of Joe Smith or whoever. I 

thought there was some rule that says the identity of 

the person is not suppressible. Am I wrong about that?

 MS. SCHWARZ: That -- that is a restatement 

of the Ker-Frisbie doctrine, that essentially says that 

a person cannot suppress himself, his body, in order to 

defeat the jurisdiction of the court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so how does that fit 

with your earlier answers that his identity here could 

be suppressed? And then I'll ask a second question. If 

you say that you can suppress his identity from 

information they gained after the stop when they saw 

him, why couldn't they say, well, we saw this man before 

we stopped him?

 MS. SCHWARZ: There's -- there's a 

distinction between the identity and the elicitation of 

his name, and the elicitation of his name which led to 

the DMV records.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it -- it gets you 

nowhere to say John Smith. You have to say John Smith 

was driving the car. It's the driving of the car that

you want suppressed. That's not the identity. I mean, 

John Smith, fine, you can say John Smith, John Smith, 

John Smith all you like at court. It's -- it's not 

going to get a conviction.

 But when you say John Smith was driving the 

car, then you are eliciting testimony from the officer 

concerning information he would not have had but for the 

stop, that John Smith was driving the car, right?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, this Court has always 

defined evidentiary fruit as something that -- of 

evidentiary value which the public authorities have 

caused an arrested person to yield to them during an 

illegal detention, and that's from the Davis case. And 

the DMV records would fit that definition of evidentiary 

fruit.

 And in this case, because it is the classic 

situation where there's sufficient causal connection 

between the Fourth Amendment violation and the 

subsequent discovery of the evidence to justify 

suppression, there's no reason not to apply the 

exclusionary rule here, and in fact, it meets all the 

definition of the sort of case where there would be very 

high level of deterrence as a result of applying the 

exclusionary rule.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAITLIN J. HALLIGAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. HALLIGAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I would like to start with your question, 

Justice Breyer, about what the ruling below was and 

what's at stake in this case. What the court of appeals 

held was quite narrow. It said -- and I'm reading from 

page 105a of the appendix: "We merely hold that a 

defendant may not invoke the fruit of the poisonous tree 

doctrine when the only link between improper police 

activity and the disputed evidence is that the police 

learned the defendant's name."

 So the court of appeals is focusing on the 

fact that all that was elicited here is the name of the 

defendant, and that's appropriate. Asking a name is 

fundamental to any encounter between police and 

citizens, and that's because the officer -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're suggesting that 

it's okay for the police to walk up to any citizen, 

anywhere, and say, you're under arrest until you give me

your name?

 MS. HALLIGAN: Absolutely not, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there's -- there's 

been no doubt here that it was a stop without suspicion. 

That's been presumed. So how is that different from 

what I just asked you -­

MS. HALLIGAN: Because -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That they took a person 

randomly, detained them without any suspicion, and said 

give me your name. Are you suggesting that that's okay?

 MS. HALLIGAN: No, I'm not. The legality of 

the stop here has not been adjudicated. We are 

presuming that the police acted illegally.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I am presuming. I know 

that there's counter-arguments to that.

 MS. HALLIGAN: We are not at all challenging 

this Court's decisions, certainly not Delaware v. Prouse 

or any others, which hold that the police may not stop 

someone without basis and may not certainly enforce the 

sort of statute that was at issue in Hiibel without some 

basis for asking for identification.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So isn't the eliciting 

of the name as a result of an unlawful stop something 

that could be suppressed?

 MS. HALLIGAN: It should not be subject to

suppression, and that's a distinct question from whether 

or not there was a constitutional violation that 

occurred in the stop and the asking of the name.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The name is different 

than the person, the body of the person, which has to do 

with the Court's jurisdiction. But why isn't the name 

any different than a wallet that's in somebody's pocket 

or a shirt or a hat, whatever is on the person? Why is 

a name not subject to suppression?

 Let's go past what happens here, because I 

understand the disconnect between the name, the DMV 

record, and seeing the person driving. How we tie those 

together are a different issue. But you made a bold 

statement when you started. You said that the police 

securing a name is never suppressible.

 MS. HALLIGAN: Because it has ae unique 

status, as this Court recognized in Hiibel, in the 

criminal justice system. Asking for a name is a routine 

and accepted part of any stop because the officer needs 

to know who he's dealing with. He faces an inordinate 

risk, as this Court noted in Mimms and most recently in 

Arizona v. Gant, of being shot when he approaches a car.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What's the difference 

between stopping a car and stopping a person on the 

street, as Justice Sotomayor asked? You can't stop

somebody on the street for no reason. The person looks 

to you suspicious, so you stop the person and say: Tell 

me your name. For a Terry stop, you have to have 

reasonable suspicion. So why isn't it the same for 

somebody who is driving a car?

 MS. HALLIGAN: I think it is the same in 

terms of what the Fourth Amendment requires, and 

Delaware v. Prouse holds that. We're not taking issue 

with that or asking this Court to retreat from that.

 What we are saying is that where all that is 

elicited is the name, it's not appropriate to apply the 

exclusionary rule, which is a very distinct question.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: So, Ms. Halligan, suppose -­

you're suggesting there should be an exception for 

knowledge of identity. Suppose there were a clearly 

illegal search and the government is looking for a head 

of some kind of criminal syndicate and knows this only 

by an alias, all right; and -- and finds out as a result 

of this illegal search -- pick your -- pick your alias, 

you know, John Smith -- finds out, you know -- finds out 

that this person whose house they're searching is John 

Smith, is the head of this criminal syndicate.

 Can the government then use that knowledge 

of identity, knowledge that this person goes under this 

alias, in order to build a case around this guy?

MS. HALLIGAN: In your hypothetical I'm not 

sure whether there would be any Fifth Amendment issues 

that would be at play, but -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: No, they find out this 

person's alias as the result of the illegal search, and 

that allows them to build a substantial criminal case.

 MS. HALLIGAN: If all that is obtained is 

the name, then the exclusionary rule should not be 

applied.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: So there's a diary, and it 

says: I am John Smith. That's Keyser Soze.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE KAGAN: I am Keyser Soze. That 

would not be suppressible?

 MS. HALLIGAN: The diary itself, the 

document would be suppressible. The knowledge that that 

person is the -- is Keyser Soze would not be subject to 

suppression, and knowledge should never be something 

that is subject to suppression, in any event.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that when -- when 

the police stopped this particular car, they saw that 

Mr. Tolentino was smoking marijuana or snorting cocaine 

or drinking from a bottle of alcohol or he had somebody 

tied up, bound and gagged on the back seat of the car. 

Now, all of those things would clearly be the fruit -­

all those observations would clearly be the fruit of the 

allegedly illegal stop, right?

 MS. HALLIGAN: That's correct, and -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Even though they were in 

plain view, they would all be suppressed, right?

 MS. HALLIGAN: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But you're saying that the 

observation that Mr. Tolentino is at the wheel of the 

car, that is not suppressed?

 MS. HALLIGAN: I would like to distinguish 

between the observation of the person driving the car, 

to the extent that you might have a case in which that 

observation is made after the stop as opposed to before 

the stop; that's a different and distinct question. 

It's not presented in the case that's before the Court 

right now -- from the question of whether the 

exclusionary rule should be applied when only the name 

is elicited.

 The observations, it may be as -- as Justice 

Ginsburg suggested that under Crews, because the 

physiognomy of a person -- five justices determined 

there the appearance is not something that's subject to 

suppression, the police officer's observation that it 

was in fact this individual who looks like this driving 

the car would not be subject to suppression, either.

But that's not presented. All that is at issue here is 

whether or not the elicitation of the name and the 

records directly linked to that are subject to 

suppression.

 JUSTICE BREYER: He made a mistake and said: 

I'm driving the car.

 MS. HALLIGAN: Pardon?

 JUSTICE BREYER: He made a mistake. He said 

in court: I was driving the core -- car. He never 

should have said it. All right, now once he said it, 

now we know he's driving the car.

 MS. HALLIGAN: Well -­

JUSTICE BREYER: So now you're saying why 

does this case even come up? Because once you have his 

name, the second he said it in court you could go up 

looking his -- you could go look at his -- his records 

anyway; you could find all these -- the facts about him 

which I guess could you bring in.

 MS. HALLIGAN: Well, that's right, and 

that's why part of why a name should not be -­

JUSTICE BREYER: So this case shouldn't be a 

special rule, it should just be a case of -- what is it

 MS. HALLIGAN: What happened is this: In 

the suppression motion initially, the defendant sought 

to suppress a number of things, including the 

observations of the police. The trial court judge did 

not rule specifically on that aspect of the suppression 

motion. The trial court judge said that there would be 

a suppression hearing on the statement that the

defendant made, but there would not be a suppression 

hearing with regard to the DMV records because DMV 

records were not subject to suppression.

 At that point the defendant pled guilty, and 

so by operation of State law -- because first of all 

there was not a ruling specifically on the question of 

observations and the defendant failed to bring that to 

the trial court judge's attention, and because the 

guilty plea was taken, and you can only appeal when you 

plead guilty on a suppression motion where there's a 

final order, there's no final order on the observation. 

That's out of the case, that would be our position.

 You could have a subsequent case where that 

question would be presented if, in fact, an officer does 

not see a defendant until after he approaches the car, 

and in that case he would have to determine whether or 

not Crews and the five justices, which says the 

physiognomy of the defendant is not subject to 

suppression, controls and therefore allows the 

observations to come in; but it's not presented here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- is your 

position that they can do anything in terms of the 

search of a name? Could they punch it into Google or 

something like that and find out a lot more than just 

what they have in their own possession?

saying they're just -- or you know, you're just talking 

about the name, but names are meaningless in the 

abstract. It's not just that the officer wants to know

that's why if the Court was concerned about the 

potential breadth of that holding, it could narrow it to 

the use of the name to link to government records. In 

the field, in particular, what an officer is going to 

look for is records that suggest danger, so for example 

what the officers have in New York State is they -­

can -- that may be what the officer on the scene is most 

interested in, of course, but once you get the guy's 

name you're interested in a lot of things.

 MS. HALLIGAN: That's right, and that's 

because you are in the process of conducting some sort 

of investigation, and to suppress the knowledge of 

someone's identity would -- would blink reality.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they're not 

suppressing the knowledge of somebody's identity. All 

that -- what's being suppressed is the evidence of 

criminal activity that you derive from that.

 MS. HALLIGAN: I think it's very different 

than when you have drugs in a car which could clearly be 

subject to suppression. All that you have here, first 

of all, that's elicited, is the name. The name itself 

is not subject to suppression, nor did the defendant 

seek to have it suppressed, as the court of appeals 

observed. And so that should be the end of the inquiry. 

If the antecedent piece of evidence is not subject to 

suppression then there's no poison that can flow from 

that to contaminate anything like the DMV record.

suppressed, but it still might be that everything that's 

discovered as a result of knowing the name, which would 

never be discovered unless the search had taken place, 

could be suppressible.

 MS. HALLIGAN: Two points, Justice Kagan. 

believe, first of all, that if the name is not 

suppressed and then something flows from the name, I 

don't think that you can skip that step and then 

suppress something that comes further down the road. 

But, secondly, the fact that these records were already 

in the government's possession is precisely what takes 

this outside the scope of the fruits doctrine. The 

fruits -- fruits doctrine has been held to apply 

repeatedly in cases where the evidence is in some sense 

the product of the illegal government activity. These 

records are simply not the product of any government 

activity.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Why does it -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Could I go back and ask you 

to -- to explain what -- how you -- you think the -- the 

request for suppression of the police officer's 

observation was waived? That was raised in the motion 

to suppress, page 17A of the joint appendix.

Supreme Court apparently didn't understand that that 

issue was in the case and ruled only on suppression of 

the records and tangible evidence, is that right, 78A?

 MS. HALLIGAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the -- what is Mr. 

Tolentino supposed to do at that point to preserve the 

issue of the suppression of a police officer's 

observation?

 MS. HALLIGAN: To preserve the issue, Mr. 

Tolentino should have raised that fact to the judge, 

should have pointed it out pursuant to CPLR 71070, 

subsection (2). There's also case law explaining that 

when that happens, that is the obligation of the 

defendant and the defendant cannot raise the issue on 

appeal if it's not brought to the attention of the trial 

court judge at that point.

 JUSTICE ALITO: The defendant raises an 

issue before the trial judge, the trial judge ignores 

that issue, misses the issue -­

MS. HALLIGAN: And then the defendant pleads 

guilty.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- and then the defendant 

waives the issue unless the defendant says by the way, 

you missed -- you failed to address one of the arguments 

that I made?

MS. HALLIGAN: At the point at which the 

defendant pleads guilty, that is correct, Your Honor. 

The defendant pled guilty prior to seeking any ruling on 

that, specifically, or any clarification. None of this 

is -- is briefed before the Court, but the defendant 

also did not raise the issue of the observations in the 

brief to the intermediate State appellate court, the 

State court of appeals or this Court. So it has been 

deemed abandoned a long time ago. And in the oral 

argument before the New York Court of Appeals, the 

defendant seemed to concur in the fact that it had been 

abandoned.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you make the 

point that these records are already in the government's 

possession.

 MS. HALLIGAN: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, isn't that 

true of everything that's available on any type of 

database? Everything in Google or whatever the other 

search engines are is in the government's possession in 

the sense that they've got it; all they've got to do is 

identify it in their search, and they've got it.

 MS. HALLIGAN: Well, this is in the 

government's possession in the literal sense of the 

word, and in fact to correct something that was said

previously, although it's not in the record, the DMV 

records, along with other records, such as arrest 

warrants, are in fact in the NYPD's possession. They 

use a database that the State police generate which they 

download onto their server. So they have it in their 

actual possession, which is different from -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it can't make 

a difference on whose server it is, does it?

 MS. HALLIGAN: No, I'm simply saying that it 

is in their possession.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is information 

that they can get if they have the correct way of 

searching it, which is here by name.

 MS. HALLIGAN: And -- and the fact that they 

are drawn to the records because they have stopped this 

individual and they have this name does not disqualify 

them from using those records. This Court has cited 

several times with approval to a case called Bynum in 

the D.C. circuit in which there were prints that were 

taken following an illegal detention, and those prints 

were suppressed. The prosecution knew that the 

defendant had committed the crime, because those prints 

had been taken and matched, and the defendant -- or the 

prosecution was allowed to use a set of prints that it 

already had in its files on retrial.

The same thing happened in both Davis and 

Hayes. In fact, in both of those cases, there were 

convictions on remand, and the prosecution's attention 

was drawn to the defendant only following some illegal 

activity.

 I would like to -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you something 

about the practice in New York? I mean, there is an 

artificiality to this case because we are assuming that 

the stop was unlawful.

 MS. HALLIGAN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the police said it 

was lawful, because the radio was blasting so loud. Why 

did this issue even -- the issue of "suppose it was 

unlawful" even come up, instead of the city or the 

county saying what the police stopped him for was a 

traffic violation, was perfectly legal? Why get to the 

constitutional question when the prosecutor brought into 

play the argument that this was a lawful stop?

 MS. HALLIGAN: The prosecutor made two 

arguments on the -- in response to the suppression 

motion. One was that the DMV records were not subject 

to suppression as a category. The second was, as you 

say, that the stop was legal. The trial court judge 

ruled only on the first ground and did not hold a

that's why it comes to you in this posture.

 JUSTICE ALITO: It does seem rather strange. 

That would have been, like, a 10-minute hearing. Why 

did you stop him? Well, he was playing the music too 

loud. Defendant testifies, I wasn't playing my music 

too loud. The trial judge says, Well, I believe you, or 

I believe you, and that's the end of the matter. It 

does seem really -- that's how things are done in trial 

court in New York City? You jump to these big 

constitutional issues and -­

difficult question, Your Honor. There are certain 

entities to which driving records can be disclosed 

pursuant to the Federal Driver's Privacy Protection Act, 

and there are also certain restrictions. So I think the 

answer to your question would depend on who was asking. 

But they are certainly the administrative adjudications 

that are made by a judge in traffic court, and in that 

sense, they are every bit as valid a record as the 

decision of any other court. There are simply certain 

protections with respect to DMV records specifically.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Your government records 

argument, is it limited to New York City records or does 

it also apply to FBI records, to records of other cities 

and states which, presumably, would be available on a 

reciprocal basis?

records available on a reciprocal basis, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you see no 

difference between Crews and Bynum, in the typical case 

where the evidence against the defendant is not 

developed as a result of an illegal stop -- it exists 

independent of that stop -- and one in which the stop 

itself creates the ground for arrest? Don't you see a 

difference between those two things?

creates the grounds for arrest here is the fact that the 

individual was driving with a suspended license, and 

no -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there was no 

suspicion of that when that person was stopped. The 

suspicion to arrest arose not independent of the 

illegality, but as part of it.

 MS. HALLIGAN: But so, too, with Bynum. It 

was the match of the prints that caused the prosecutor 

to realize that this individual was guilty -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But all of the evidence 

at trial really had nothing to do with the fingerprint. 

It had to do with the victims and everyone else walking 

in and saying, That's the guy who did lie to me.

Honor, the prints were critical, and here the only

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In the arrest.

 MS. HALLIGAN: No, in the adjudication 

itself. The appellate decision -- may I finish my

the ability to locate those prior prints in the FBI file 

was essential to the conviction there.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH,

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

 MR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Petitioner seeks to suppress official 

records that were lawfully in the State's possession 

before any Fourth Amendment violation occurred. That 

unprecedented request should be rejected for three 

reasons.

 One, the DMV records were accessed merely 

through use of Petitioner's name; two, those records 

were produced and possessed by the State long before the 

allegedly illegal stop at issue; and, three, deterrence 

does not outweigh the costs, the substantial costs of 

suppression under the circumstances present here.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is everything that 

the government has access to through any database 

considered in the government's possession?

argument. I think it would have to be information -­

 MR. SHAH: Right, effectively in the 

government's possession I think would be the standard. 

So here I think we're talking, not about Google, but I 

think we're talking about governmental records.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what's the 

difference? In either case, they need some search term, 

and then they will get the answers. I don't see why it 

makes a difference.

 MR. SHAH: I think for the governmental 

records part of our argument, that rationale is an 

independent rationale. The key part of it is that the 

information was actually in the government's possession 

before the Fourth Amendment violation occurred. I think 

it's fairer to say that governmental records that are 

produced and owned and possessed by the government 

qualify. I think it's a harder argument to make that 

something -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if -- I'm 

sorry, go ahead.

 MR. SHAH: That something might be -- that 

something that could be found by using Google was 

already in the government's possession before the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if it's 

in the -- the government of Colorado's possession, and 

they have an arrangement with New York that they will 

let them check their files to find out, you know, 

whatever it is, nationwide or something? Does that -­

your argument apply to that?

 MR. SHAH: I think it could. I think it 

would depend on the arrangement. If it's a fully 

reciprocal arrangement that effectively allows the State 

full access to those records, then I think it may be 

tantamount to the State having effective possession.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: How about private databases 

that are going to be available to the government upon 

request?

 MR. SHAH: I think -- I think that's 

stretching it a little bit further. That's a little bit 

harder. Again, if it were the case that the State could 

be said to have effectively have possession of those 

records because, for example, a copy of them are sitting 

on their servers or they have such full access that even 

though they're prepared by a private database, the State 

has paid for them, so they're effectively State records, 

that may also fall within the scope. But those are 

questions that are essentially pushing the boundary of

victims, whatever you want. Have you any doubt that

simply because you get them through a name? You break 

into a house, get a name; as a result of the name, you

that criminal enterprise going to, you get every

name, they see this guy is Dagwood, and so they run that 

through their -- their database, and they find this is 

the guy we've been looking for, for the last 20 years. 

He is responsible for all the drugs that come into this 

country, he's committed numerous acts of terrorism, he's 

a -- he's a serial killer, he's killed 50 people, we've 

been chasing him forever, and so the -- the result would 

be all that knowledge, that this is Dagwood is the fruit 

of the poisonous tree and nothing can be done about 

Dagwood?

 MR. SHAH: No, no, Your Honor. I want to be 

very clear. My response is that that is not subject to 

suppression. And -- and -- and even my friend on the 

other side conceded that if it were an -- an outstanding 

arrest warrant such as in your hypothetical that would 

lead to of the name, even if the name were a fruit of an 

illegal stop or search, that that arrest warrant would 

still provide a basis to arrest the defendant and 

prosecute the defendant.

 Now, it may be that other fruits that are 

discovered in the home or statements taken from the 

defendant in the home would be suppressed, but certainly 

the prosecution could proceed under the Ker-Frisbie 

Rule, and any preexisting evidence that this person was 

an axe murderer or whatever else evidence that the

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You mentioned some -­

before you finish, you -- you said a name is not 

suppressible, and that's because this Court held -- we 

started out by saying the observation of the person that 

dropped out of this case, so we're talking only about 

records, but the extraction of a name, you say that's 

not suppressible, even though it was unlawfully 

extracted because there were no reasonable suspicions 

that this person did anything wrong?

 MR. SHAH: Yes -- yes, Your Honor, we would 

say that a name is different, that it's not 

suppressible, and we would rely on the language this 

Court used in Lopez-Mendoza, which says the respondent's 

body or identity is never suppressible, even if it's 

obtained as a result of an illegal search, seizure or 

interrogation.

 We think name is -- is part and parcel of a 

defendant's identity, and that it has a special status 

within -- within the criminal justice system.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Shah, how would you

stopping people and rather than asking for your name,

then they take that blood and they look in their very 

extensive DNA databases, and they discover, oh, this is 

a guy who, you know, did these various terrible things, 

and start building cases. Would that be all right?

 MR. SHAH: Your Honor, I think other types 

of biometric evidence that you suggest, for example, of 

blood evidence, might well implicate competing 

considerations that would dictate a different result. 

And let me suggest a couple of the competing 

considerations, why I think the Court doesn't need to 

reach so far and say all sorts of biometric information 

should be treated the same.

 For -- for one -- for one thing, things like 

a name or even a fingerprint, this Court has said is not 

a separate Fourth Amendment event to acquire that. For 

example, once someone is detained, it's not also a 

search to ask for their name or to take a fingerprint.

 However, in your example, pricking someone 

with a needle to obtain their blood would be a separate 

Fourth Amendment event, because that would be a separate 

invasion of their -- of their bodily integrity, privacy, 

and that might warrant different considerations, since 

there are two violations there. There might be a need 

for greater deterrent.

 I think the other sort of consideration that

might be implicated in -- in that type of hypothetical 

is that evidence unlike a name or fingerprint, DNA 

evidence, for example, that you suggest, might provide 

competing considerations in the sense that it could lead 

to other types of information that not -- that may not 

be relevant to the criminal justice system, medical 

records, genetic information. It may pose a specter of 

other competing considerations that might require a 

different balance in the end.

 I think it would be premature for this Court 

to weigh in one way or another as to whether that would 

be appropriate. I think we would need a record and we 

would want time to -- to -- to -- we would want that to 

play out and see -- and see what the consequences were. 

So I don't think the Court has to go that far. I think 

the Court can limit it, as in this case, to name, 

fingerprints and other traditionally -- other 

information traditionally used to identify a defendant.

should be, and -- excuse me. So long as there's 

sufficient causal relationship between the Fourth 

Amendment violation and the later discovery of evidence, 

this Court has expressed continued allegiance to this 

rule. So in this case the reason why the DMV records 

are suppressible fruit is it fits that classic 

definition.

 Why are the observations suppressible when 

the identity isn't? That's another issue that was 

raised. The observations are -- again, they fit the 

definition whereas the identity does -- does not fit 

that. The Ker-Frisbie rule prevents a person himself 

from being suppressible, but the elicitation of his name 

is something entirely separate. So in other word, in 

the Crews case a majority of the Court said that a -- a 

person could not suppress their person or their face 

from being in court; five of the justices said that; but 

five justices said that the in-court identification 

could under certain circumstances be suppressible. So 

they drew a distinction between the person's body being 

brought into court, which is not suppressible because of 

the Ker-Frisbie rule, and then the evidentiary use of 

the identity, the fact that the five of the justices 

said that in certain circumstances not applicable in 

that case, the in-court identification could be

suppressible shows the distinction. And that's the 

distinction that has been -- is confusing about this 

case, because the elicitation of his name is what led to 

the DMV records. But even if this Court found that the 

elicitation of the name was not sufficient or was 

somehow related to Ker-Frisbie and could not be 

suppressible, the DMV records directly flow from the 

Fourth Amendment violation here, from the Prouse 

violation. And so it really doesn't really matter.

 Especially in light of the decision in Whren 

to remove subjective motivations from the determinations 

of constitutional reasonableness in car stops, it's 

essential to enforce what remains of motorists' core 

Fourth Amendment rights; and the Whren standards just 

must be enforced; otherwise these core Fourth Amendment 

values will be undermined and police will be left free 

to stop people on the roads with no objective basis and 

check their ID and status and do fishing expeditions 

into this sea of data that will be linked to the police 

computers; and this would violate Prouse and Brown and 

Hiibel.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I suppose would 

subject the police officers to liability, though, right? 

In civil actions?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, again, this is a classic

case where there's a clear relationship, a causal 

relationship, so this is the sort of case where this 

Court has continued allegiance to application of the 

exclusionary rule where the exclusionary rule is very 

strong; and so why would the Court say that the second 

sister of the exclusionary rule, in this circumstance 

where there's sufficiently deliberate, that exclusion 

would be meaningful and sufficiently culpable, that the 

evidence would be -- that application of the rule would 

be worth the cost? In this situation there's no reason 

to abandon the exclusionary rule.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, are you 

agreeing with your adversary that you abandoned and are 

not entitled to raise the suppressibility of the 

observation?

 MS. SCHWARZ: No. Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if you're not, in 

what ways is it tied to the question presented about 

identity, which is the issue you sought cert on?

 MS. SCHWARZ: Right. I -- I have no qualms 

in my adversary explaining that the question presented 

was limited because of the procedure, of the way the 

trial court's decision was made. However if this Court 

remanded the case, the question of whether the 

observations were suppressible would be very much at

play.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? Because when he 

entered a guilty plea, you reserved only the question 

concerning the motor vehicle records; you didn't reserve 

any other questions.

 MS. SCHWARZ: Well, but at the suppression 

hearing, the -- the court would be free to consider all 

of the suppressible fruit, including the -- the 

statement that was made and the observations and also 

the DMV records.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
