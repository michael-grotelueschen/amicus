 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in 05-1429, Travelers Casualty and Surety Company 

versus Pacific Gas and Electric Company.

 Mr. Brunstad.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Ninth Circuit's Fobian rule creates an 

unwarranted Federal common law rule that exists outside 

the structure of the Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy 

Code has a distinct structure. For example, if a debtor 

has a right to an attorneys' fees valid under State law, 

after the petition date, the date the debtor files for 

bankruptcy, that right passes to the bankruptcy estate. 

If a creditor has a State law right to attorneys' fees, 

after the petition date, that right becomes a claim in 

bankruptcy.

 The Ninth Circuit's Fobian rule intercepts 

those rights even before we get to what the Bankruptcy 

Code provides or does to them and basically says, if 

you're litigating Federal issues, you simply cannot have 

a right to attorneys' fees unless the Federal law

authorizes that right, in this case, contractual rights, 

or alternatively rights available under State statute.

 That, we submit, is an impermissible 

creation of a Federal common law rule. There is no 

basis for it under this Court's preemption precedents. 

There's no conflict between Federal policy and State 

policy which would justify the creation of the rule, and 

accordingly, it is unwarranted.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me -- this is 

just basic bankruptcy. I should know, but I looked it 

up and couldn't find it. A standard promissory note 

which provides for attorneys' fees, the holder of the 

note is the creditor, the maker of the note is the 

bankrupt -- the maker of the note goes bankrupt. The 

holder of the note gets his attorney and says: File a 

claim in bankruptcy. And the attorney sends him a bill. 

Is the attorneys' fees, the attorney fee for filing the 

bankruptcy claim, recoverable as part of the claim?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: It depends, Justice Kennedy. 

It depends on what their contractual right provides. 

Here we have a contractual --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's the standard, it's 

the standard attorneys' fee provision, all attorneys' 

fees in connection with collection of this note and 

enforcement of the terms of this note.

MR. BRUNSTAD: Then, yes, Justice Kennedy, I 

would say it probably would be covered. It probably 

would be covered and the analysis --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there something where I 

can look that up in Collier? Are there millions of 

cases? I mean, this seems to me fairly rudimentary.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Kennedy. In our 

reply brief, we do cite to Collier, where we talk about 

exactly that scenario and it is described. And it 

basically works like this. A claim under the Bankruptcy 

Code is defined under Section 1015. The claim includes 

any right to payment whether it's contingent or fixed, 

matured, unmatured, et cetera. Any right to payment, 

literally any right to payment, when the debtor files 

for bankruptcy, that becomes a claim. If the right --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. But in my case, 

it's a post-petition action.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Kennedy. The 

key concept -- and this is explained clearly in Collier 

-- is where does the right come from? If it arises out 

of a pre-petition contract, then the right is 

pre-petition in nature, even though the fees are 

incurred post-petition. Think of a guarantee. Think of 

if PG&E had guaranteed its parent's debt for the $100 

million, let's say.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Could you just back up 

just for a second? Supposing at the time of the 

bankruptcy that the services have not been performed. 

It's post-petition conduct by the lawyer.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, in that case, 

are you saying that routinely the lawyer recovers fees 

in the bankruptcy case even if the debtor, the debtor 

was insolvent? And we're assuming insolvency in the 

hypothetical, although it may not fit this case.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Exactly, yes, Justice 

Stevens, if in fact, though, the creditor bothers to 

assert the claim for fees in the bankruptcy case. In 

most cases, creditors don't, because it's not worth the 

effort of asserting the claim for fees subsequently. In 

cases such as this, where you have a solvent debtor who 

can pay all claims in full, there's no reason why they 

should be able to get out of their contractual 

obligations in bankruptcy.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why wouldn't it be 

worth -- I know here. But why wouldn't it be worth the 

effort, instead of getting $90 on the note, to get 95?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, because there's a 

transaction cost in actually filing the additional claim 

setting forth the amount that you've incurred. In most

cases, Justice Stevens, creditors don't even hire 

attorneys to pursue or file a claim in bankruptcy. In 

most Chapter 7 cases, for example, they are no-asset 

cases.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Are you telling me just 

based on your experience that in Justice Kennedy's 

hypothetical, normally, no fees are recovered?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Normally, there's no 

distribution on unsecured claims in most bankruptcy 

cases. So why bother?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But assuming in those 

cases where there's some distribution, is it correct, as 

I'm assuming your answer to Justice Kennedy's question, 

that the normal practice is you don't bother because 

there is not enough involved?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Typically, Justice Stevens, 

that is correct. But in cases such as this, where the 

attorneys' fees are substantial, the debtor is solvent, 

and there are substantial --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just in the hypothetical, 

I would think that in many cases, there's going to be 

some payout for the promissory note, and the holder of 

the note tells his attorneys: Make sure I get that 

claim in bankruptcy. The attorney files a claim. And 

every attorney that files a claim for a promissory note

which is entitled to a fee from the bankruptcy court for 

filing in the bankruptcy court.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: For the work done in 

performing, filing the proof of claim, that's correct. 

And even though, Justice Kennedy, the attorney's conduct 

was after the debtor filed for bankruptcy, the right to 

payment arises out of the pre-petition contract. Again, 

think of the guarantee hypothetical. There you had the 

JUSTICE STEVENS: The pre-petition contract, 

but not out of pre-petition conduct.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: That's correct, Justice 

Stevens. But just think about the pre-petition tort 

claim, where there has been exposure to asbestos 

products pre-petition, but the injury arises 

post-petition. It's still a pre-petition claim.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but you're one step 

ahead of that here, because here there hasn't been any, 

in effect, any exposure. Here there isn't any certain 

default on the note. So far as we know, here, there may 

never be any default on the workers comp obligation. So 

that your contingency is a much more remote contingency. 

Why should that, why should this case fall into the same 

category as the promissory note?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Souter, it's

different in this sense. This is an indemnity, all-loss 

indemnity provision. The surety is not supposed to 

incur any loss, any cost whatsoever, for supplying these 

surety bonds to PG&E.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And so far as we know, it 

won't.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But it has, because when PG&E 

filed for bankruptcy --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it has, but that 

depends on a totally circular argument. The minute it 

filed for bankruptcy, although there had been no default 

on the comp obligation, your client started incurring 

attorneys' fees, and it was not incurring attorneys' 

fees based on any default by the, by the debtor.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Souter, you can 

visualize bankruptcy itself as being a default. When 

the debtor files for bankruptcy, you must come to the 

bankruptcy court to present your rights --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You can call bankruptcy a 

default, but that's not what I mean, and you know that's 

not what I mean. I'm talking about a default on the 

workers comp obligation.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: There has been no default 

on the workers comp obligation, and because they intend

to keep on running this business, there is reason to 

suppose that there will not be.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, by analogy, Justice 

Souter, in the LTV case, the same posture at the 

beginning of the case. We don't know what's going to 

happen in the future. You must file your claim at the 

beginning of the case. In LTV --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, and maybe you don't 

have a claim at the beginning of the case. I mean, 

that's what we're getting at. We can understand the 

claim when the note -- when you've got a promissory note 

and you're out of money. The claim is inevitable. In 

this case, there is no inevitable claim.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But that's precisely the 

point of why claim is defined so broadly to include 

contingent claims.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if it is defined as 

broadly as this, we're in a situation exactly like this. 

There has been no default on the obligation, and prior 

to getting to this Court, $167,000 has been racked up in 

legal fees that accomplishes absolutely nothing.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Absolutely false, Justice 

Souter. In bankruptcy, if you do not present your 

rights, if the rights of the workers themselves are not 

properly treated, they are lost. Under Section 1141,

they are extinguished.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right, in this case, 

$167,000 has been spent to come to the conclusion, as I 

understand it. That if the time comes to assert a right 

of indemnification, you can assert a right of 

indemnification and we can oppose it. If we are going 

to construe the bankruptcy law to provide a law like 

this, then maybe there is something wrong in the, in the 

construction of the bankruptcy law.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Souter, because 

if you look at what Section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code 

does, it provides that a plan of reorganization binds 

all parties. If you're not provided for adequately in 

the plan under Section 1141(d), your rights are 

extinguished forever. You must come to the bankruptcy 

court; you must be sure that the rights are properly 

characterized. Excuse me.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not what this 

bankruptcy court thought about the claim. This 

bankruptcy court said some rather critical things.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but I 

think we need to distinguish two different things. 

There was the work that was performed in preserving the 

rights of the injured employees, to make sure they were 

properly classified, that their rights were rendered

unimpaired. If that hadn't been in the plan, then their 

rights would have been extinguished under Section 1141.

 Then there was the claim that the surety 

provides for having had to have done all of that work.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I don't -- there was 

never a time that the plan said we are not going to pay 

our workers' compensation.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: The problem, Justice 

Ginsburg, is that the plan said nothing at all. And 

when the plan says nothing at all, the default rule in 

bankruptcy is that rights are extinguished; they are 

discharged under Section 1141(d). It must be in the 

plan in order to be invalid after the confirmation of 

the plan. We had to assure those rights were properly 

treated in the plan, because if they weren't, they would 

have been discharged under the general -- general 

discharge provision.

 That is why one must come to the bankruptcy 

court, one must file a proof of claim, one must enforce 

your rights in bankruptcy; if you don't, you lose them. 

That's why the surety here stepped forward, said it has 

subrogation rights; the workers have rights. And the 

bankruptcy court agreed with Travelers. It directed the 

debtor to put that language in the plan. Travelers --

section of the code that preserved subrogation rights.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: That's Section 509, Justice 

Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But that's not what I was 

speaking of just momentarily. The rights of the injured 

employees, the workers, when they filed for -- when PG&E 

filed for bankruptcy, the injured workers had claims. 

They were going to receive periodic benefit payments off 

into the future. If PG&E had not properly provided for 

those claims in the bankruptcy case in their plan, those 

claims would have been extinguished. As a result, 

though, Travelers would not have been off the hook on 

its surety bond, Travelers would have had to have 

stepped forward and make the payments if PG&E did not.

 But if Travelers hadn't come to the 

bankruptcy court and said, these are our rights, these 

need to be preserved, its recourse against PG&E would 

have extinguished as well. If one does not come to the 

bankruptcy court and assert one's rights, one loses 

them. And of course, creditors when they do have to 

assert their rights, incur attorneys' fees for doing so. 

And here we had a pre-petition contract that said, 

whatever loss we incur, including attorneys' fees, we 

have a right to recover, a right to payment. That

becomes the claim.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume, let's assume 

that one of the recipients of comp payments had come 

forward and said: I object to the plan, I have a claim 

for comp payments and I object to the plan because it 

doesn't provide for them. And the -- the court said, 

you're, you're right. The plan is going to include 

provision for comp payments and it had been so amended, 

and it was then -- the plan was then amended.

 Would you, under those circumstances, have 

had any -- would Travelers, under those circumstances, 

have had any reason to assert a claim?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: We would not have done that 

work. No, Justice Souter, because the injured worker 

him or herself would have done it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I know it. But would 

you have had any other claim that you would have 

asserted, had that been done?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, with respect to the, 

the treatment of the workers under the plan, no. With 

respect to --

JUSTICE SOUTER: With respect to any 

interest of Travelers?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Souter.

would Travelers have asserted a claim?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: We would have said, in our 

proof of claim, as we did: If we must make payment in 

the future, we are entitled to two things. One, we are 

entitled to reimbursement from PG&E for any amount that 

we must spend in the future whenever that might occur. 

Two, if we have to pay any of the employees, we are 

subrogated. We stand in the shoes of the employees and 

may assert those rights.

 The subrogation right would have been fully 

protected, though, Justice Souter, because of the 

treatment of the workers in the plan rendering them 

unimpaired. We would have left simply -- with simply 

saying we have these reimbursement rights which we would 

have in case we have to make payment.

 Now, in the LTV case, which we cite in our 

papers, at the beginning of the LTV case, the surety who 

has had $40 million in surety bonds was in a position, 

very much the same as in this case, when PG&E filed. 

PG&E got an order authorizing it to continue to pay but 

not requiring it to pay. That can only be done in the 

plan of reorganization. LTV started paying the workers' 

comp benefits, but then defaulted and stopped, long

after the bankruptcy case had commenced, but far short 

of when it concluded. The surety had to step up to the 

plate and make the payments.

 If the surety had not filed a proof of claim 

at the beginning of the case, the surety would have lost 

its recourse against the debtor, LTV, even though it 

subsequently, far later, had to make payment.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Correct me if I'm 

wrong --

MR. BRUNSTAD: That's how bankruptcy works.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In -- in this case, I 

thought that if a contingency claim for indemnification 

is not allowed, but if it becomes fixed at some time, 

then the claim can be made and is not lost.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Justice Ginsburg. There 

is a bar date set in the beginning of Chapter 11 cases. 

You must file your claim by the bar date or you'll be 

forever barred, even if your liability becomes fixed 

later.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm talking about 

502(e)(1).

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, if 

your reimbursement claim is contingent, it will be 

disallowed, subject to reconsideration under Section 

502(j). And that's what the parties stipulated to in

this case in our stipulation. We filed our proof of 

claim, then PG&E objected to our proof of claim, but 

Justice Ginsburg, PG&E did a lot more than just object 

to our contingent reimbursement rights. They 

mischaracterized our subrogation rights as claims; they 

sought to disallow our subrogation claims; and they 

sought to subordinate our claims. Plus in addition, 

they sought to disallow the claims of the injured 

workers.

 So we had to respond to the litigation that 

was commenced. We had to defend our rights, and we were 

successful. The workers' claims were ultimately left 

unimpaired in the bankruptcy as they should have been. 

PG&E was fully responsible for paying the workers' 

claims.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In any case, this has 

nothing to do with the, Fobian, so-called Fobian issue, 

whether the Ninth Circuit drew the bright line.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct, Justice Ginsburg. 

The Fobian rule, we submit, is an impermissible creation 

of Federal common law. It's not justified by any 

concept of preemption; there is no conflict with 

bankruptcy policy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me just ask you about 

the Fobian, and I know Justice Breyer has a question.

 Let's assume that you're correct in that the 

fees are allowable. Can the bankruptcy court make the 

determination of the reasonableness of the fees?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: It depends, Justice Kennedy. 

If State law, if it's an unsecured claim under Section 

501(b)(1) --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In this case.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: In this case, that would be a 

determination under State law. Every State, Your Honor, 

has a reasonableness requirement.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so if the bankruptcy 

judge isn't sure of what the amount is, he looks to 

State law to determine the amount?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Kennedy. Under 

Section 501(b)(1) --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the bankruptcy court 

does determine reasonableness.

 MS. MAHONEY: If State law provides for it, 

and all States do. The bankruptcy court adopts the 

State reasonableness standard for unsecured claims under 

Section 502(b)(1). Yes, Justice Breyer?

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sort of back where 

Justice Kennedy started on this. Forget -- I'd like to

forget your case, because your case seems to me to be a 

case where parties argue reasonably about whether the 

contract itself covers this kind of fee. And maybe it 

doesn't, if it's very unreasonable, et cetera.

 But let's take a very straightforward case. 

It's an obvious contract to collect a debt, or maybe a 

mortgage, and in the debt or the mortgage agreement, it 

says, attorneys' fees will be paid for collection. It 

clearly covers bankruptcy, too, by its language.

 And now there must be many instances or 

some, anyway, where the security is inadequate.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: The security --

JUSTICE BREYER: And there must be other 

instances in which there wasn't any security. And if I 

read Collier as you pointed to, that seems to say, in 

such cases, very simple, the creditor has the status of 

an unsecured creditor in respect to those attorneys' 

fees.

 BRUNSTAD: And in --

JUSTICE BREYER: Overage in the secured 

case, and the whole claim in the unsecured case. So get 

in the queue and you can collect your pro-rata share.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Absolutely, Justice Breyer.

professors on the other side coming to tell me that

that's never happened. They can't even find an 

instance. So it isn't as if, it isn't as if you haven't 

found an instance, it is that they are prepared to say 

it never happened. And then there may be one exception 

or two or something like that.

 And I can't, that -- I'm now totally 

puzzled. Because if it's so clear as you say, and I 

follow your logic, and I followed Collier, why? After 

all, there are bankrupt people who do have some assets. 

Explain it.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer it happens all 

the time. In our brief, we cite to many, many cases in 

which attorneys' fees are allowed as unsecured claims. 

It's actually been happening for over 100 years, it 

happened in the Bankruptcy Act of 1998.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. But -- but we are 

talking about attorneys' fees for services performed in 

the bankruptcy proceeding?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The cost of filing the 

claim, the cost of talking to the bankruptcy judge, et 

cetera.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct, Your Honor. And in 

a key case we cited, the Second Circuit's decision, 

United Manufacturers and Merchants, where they didn't

even hire an attorney until after the bankruptcy case 

was filed, the attorney performed services, filing a 

proof of claim, protecting the equitable rights, and the 

Second Circuit clearly held that those attorneys' fees 

were properly part of the unsecured claim, but it 

couldn't be any clearer. And the Second Circuit --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But what I don't -- there 

is a body of law on the other side of that issue, too, 

isn't there?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: There is, Justice Stevens, 

but those are lower court decisions.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. Absolutely. The 

Second Circuit is a lower court.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, compared to this Court, 

certainly, Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's exactly right. 

There are no cases from this Court speaking to this 

precise issue, are there? On which there is a 

disagreement among the lower courts?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Stevens, I think it's 

important to say that the alternative rule that PG&E 

asked for is one that every court of appeals to have 

addressed has rejected. What they are saying is, oh, 

you can't get your attorneys' fees based on a 

construction of the Bankruptcy Code. No court of

appeals has accepted it. There are some lower 

bankruptcy court decisions that have accepted it, but 

that is routinely overturned on appeal.

 The issue of whether you get your attorneys' 

fees as part of an unsecured claim, Cohen versus De La 

Cruz, in that case this Court had to construe whether 

the term debt, which means under the Bankruptcy Code the 

same thing as a claim, is defined as liability on a 

claim, there the Court, this Court concluded that that 

debt included attorneys' fees, the treble damages, the 

whole nine yards.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You would have thought that 

the one group of people who ought to know this 

thoroughly, or at least have a view are the bankruptcy 

bar.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: And, and yet there are no 

briefs from them; there are not -- there is no article 

that I could find in Bankruptcy Journal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there may be 

no briefs from them because it isn't the question on 

which we granted cert, is it?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Chief Justice Roberts, that's 

correct. And our view is that the Court should deal 

only with the Fobian rule. And the alternative argument

which Respondent presented was never argued below, was 

not decided below, was not presented in the opposition 

to certiorari. It's been rejected by every single court 

of appeals --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it would be proper to 

remand for the Ninth Circuit to consider those other 

arguments?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. And 

that's exactly what this Court should do. It should 

remand their statutory interpretation argument to the 

Court of Appeals to consider, for the lower courts to 

consider. This Court deserves more than just a 20-page 

reply brief in response to 80 pages of briefing by the 

other side on an issue that was never raised below, not 

presented in the opposition to certiorari.

 Remand would be the proper thing to do with 

respect to their claim. I do believe that is true, 

Justice Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: On both their statutory 

interpretation and the contract?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: The contract, reasonableness, 

all of those issues. The circuit split, which we 

presented to the Court, and which I understand 

certiorari was -- well, I'm guessing -- certiorari was 

granted on, it deals with the Fobian rule. As this

common law rule, this sort of construct, that if you're 

litigating Federal law issues, well, as a matter of 

general Federal common law, you can't get the attorneys' 

fees unless it's authorized by Federal law.

 And our brief was entirely devoted to that. 

You can't justify that rule in our view under preemption 

principles; there's no conflict; there is no Congress 

preempting the field in any way; you can't justify this 

under Atherton as a, as a -- something that's necessary 

because of a conflict with Federal policy.

 And also the Fobian rule is inappropriately 

categorical, in violation of what we submit are these 

Court's principles in the Nolan case, in the CF and I 

case. In those cases, the Court said: It's not for the 

courts to create these claims processing rules in 

bankruptcy. But that exactly is what the Ninth Circuit 

did here.

 If there are no further questions I'd like 

to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: One quick question, if I 

may. Would one of the issues open on remand be the 

construction of the contract? Is there an issue at 

State law as to whether Travelers pays for these 

particular services?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Stevens. That

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Let me begin at the threshold, on whether 

this Court should consider the statutory construction 

argument that we've presented. The issue of statutory 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And can we be, take one 

step before that and tell us if you are conceding that 

the Fobian rule has no basis in the statute and is 

wrong?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the Fobian rule 

reaches the correct conclusion in this case, but Your 

Honor is correct. The problem with the Fobian rule is 

that it doesn't go far enough in presenting, in 

preventing creditors from requiring other creditors to 

pay for their attorneys' fees.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if you say it 

doesn't go far enough then I infer from that you say

that it's valid as far as it goes?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: It is valid as far as it 

covers this case but not on the rationale of the Ninth 

Circuit. In other words, the Ninth Circuit did begin in 

the wrong place, which was not to read the statute, 

Section 502, which is why that is a rational predicate 

to the issue that Travelers is presenting here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure I 

agree, Counsel, that the Fobian rule is both narrower 

and broader than the question you try to present. For 

example it applies to the claims of a secured creditor 

for attorneys fees on a secured claim as well.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- it doesn't?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Mr. Chief Justice. No 

court has ever held that the Fobian rule applies to 

oversecured creditors. Everyone acknowledges that 

Section 506(b) applies to oversecured creditors so.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you're an 

oversecured creditor with a claim for attorneys' fees 

arising under solely issues of matters of Federal 

bankruptcy law, the Fobian rule doesn't prevent that?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. Everyone 

is absolutely clear that Fobian to the extent that it 

applies --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, not everyone. 

I'm not clear on it.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I'm sorry, Your Honor. All 

the bankruptcy practitioners and courts are clear that 

to the extent that Fobian applies, it applies only to 

unsecured creditors. But again this is a rational 

predicate to this Court's analysis of Fobian. How do we 

know?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it is a rational 

predicate, we might have expected to hear about it in 

the opposition to certiorari.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. I 

apologize for focusing only on the issue that Travelers 

was focusing on, which was whether this was, whether the 

Fobian rule was itself cert-worthy question. But it is 

a rational predicate because, as you can see from 

Travelers' brief, Travelers says no fewer than a dozen 

times, including in two point headings: Read the code; 

read the code. It will tell you that unsecured 

creditors have an allowable claim for post-petition 

attorneys' fees, and only if you begin by reading the 

code can you figure out whether the Fobian common law 

overlay is correct or not. So when we say, Your Honors, 

yes, let's read the code, that's not an ambush and that 

is not smuggling in.

of appeals decision one way or the other on that 

question, do we?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, we do have 

court of appeals decisions on this precise question, not 

in this case because the court of appeals had Fobian and 

the rule that underlay Fobian for 20 years. But there 

are three courts of appeals --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Justice Ginsburg has a 

question I'm very interested in. Do you defend the 

Fobian rule?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: We do not, Your Honor. The 

Fobian rule is wrong at least, especially as to the 

distinction that it draws between State law and Federal 

litigation. There's only one answer to the question --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why then isn't the 

proper disposition of this case to send it back to the 

Ninth Circuit to consider all these other arguments?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, because 

this issue has been fully ventilated among the lower 

courts.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but we are not a 

court of first view and you know that very well. We are 

a court of review. So no matter how well it's been

aired, we wait to see what the lower courts have said on 

a question.  We don't take it in the first instance.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, I understand that, 

Your Honor. It would have been futile to argue this 

before the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit would have 

said that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I understand that because 

they have the Fobian rule.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes. Now, but, Your Honor, 

let me just add two additional reasons why this Court 

should consider it now. The first is this has been 

fully ventilated in the lower courts. There is not a 

single argument in the briefs on either side on which 

there is not a lower court opinion going one way or 

another on every argument.

 Secondly, there is an enormous amount of 

affirmative harm that can come from this Court simply 

saying, let us conclude that the Ninth Circuit was wrong 

in disallowing these claims on the logic that the Ninth 

Circuit followed, but we will reserve for a later day an 

open question of law on what Section 502(b) and 506(b) 

means. And the harm comes from the fact that 

overwhelmingly the lower courts in the last 10 years 

have concluded that 502(b) and 506(b) mean that 

unsecured creditors do not have these claims.

If this Court declares that it is now an 

open question --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you a question 

about that. Your argument depends -- you analogize --

you would agree, I take it, that if this was an 

oversecured, secured creditor they'd be entitled to 

fees?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, we would 

dispute the contractual interpretation, but yes, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But assuming, assuming the 

contract provides that.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if that's true 

-- and the reason for that I suppose is that doesn't 

impair the rights of the general creditors at all.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That's one logic of the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If that's so, why isn't 

their argument that, well, your client is solvent, the 

complete answer to your position?

 MR. SHORR: Well, Your Honor, because 

Congress didn't say that. Congress gave only one answer 

to the question whether unsecured creditors get their 

attorneys' fees allowed, that is post-petition 

attorneys' fees allowed. It's either yes or no. There

is no on-off switch for solvent or insolvent creditors 

within the code, which is why Travelers never argued 

that as a, an objection to the plan of confirmation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: They argue it in their 

reply brief here.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, and that 

is absolutely incorrect. If you look at the case that 

they cite, that case relies on a provision of the code, 

which is Section 726. And Section 726 is only about 

post-petition interest for solvent debtors, not 

post-petition attorneys' fees.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, how do you avoid --

what about their statement from Collier?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the statement 

that Travelers quotes from Collier is about a 

proposition that we don't dispute, which is whether it 

is a pre-petition claim. But Collier.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No. No. It said -- a 

pre-petition claim, if a creditor incurs the attorneys' 

fees post-petition, they incur it post-petition, 

afterwards they file, after the petition they file a 

claim with the bankruptcy court, in exercising or 

protecting a pre-petition claim that included a right to 

recover attorneys' fees. And they say that's what we 

have, we had a contract that gave us this right to

attorneys' fees. The fees will be pre- petitioned in 

nature, constituting a contingent pre-petition 

obligation that became fixed post-petition when the fees 

were incurred. All right. Now, what is your response 

to that?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, my response is 

I urge you, Justice Breyer, to look back at Colliers, 

because that is absolutely accurate and it doesn't apply 

to this case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Because?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Because, Your Honor, that 

is a statement about whether it is a pre-petition claim, 

not about whether the claim is allowable or not, which 

is what we are arguing about.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Then you explain that to 

me?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. Step one 

is, is it a claim. No one disputes that this is a 

claim. It is a right to payment. Step two, is this an 

allowable claim? The answer under the code is 

absolutely not, because the code says there is only one 

class of creditors that gets their attorneys' fees 

claims allowed and that is oversecured creditors and so

had to do that in order to tell the bankruptcy courts 

how to deal with secured claims.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That doesn't -- and then 

you have the negative inference or the exclusio unius 

argument, whatever, which I think is misplaced in this 

context.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, Congress put 

506(b) in the code for one purpose and one purpose only, 

and that was to allow claims that are not elsewhere 

allowed, because if it doesn't do that 506(b) serves no 

purpose at all. 506(b) says nothing at all about 

whether the claim is secured.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why doesn't it serve the 

purpose of saying that the fees will be covered by the 

security? They'll not be just be claims for fees that 

would stand together with the unsecured creditors, but 

that the oversecured -- the security will cover the 

interest, will cover the attorneys' fees, and that's the 

function of 506 whatever --

MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the answer is 

506(b) does not say anything about whether the allowed 

claim is secured or not. It is completely silent about 

that. Now, if we accept, as we explain in our brief in 

much more detail, if we accept Travelers' argument that

it was an allowed claim in the first instance and it is 

therefore furthermore an allowed security claim, 506(a) 

tells you what to do with that. 506(a) tells us that an 

allowed claim to a secured creditor is a secured claim. 

It still leaves Section 506(b) with nothing left to do.

 Now, let me just back up and underscore: 

Any creditor would love to get the other creditors to 

pay its attorneys' fees. Tort claimants would love it, 

trade creditors would love it, local tax collectors 

would love it. But Congress said only one category of 

claimants get to claim their post-petition attorneys' 

fees.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, that is exactly 

what's puzzling me. But why haven't they gone out and 

got? So why -- what you're pointing to so far is that 

Congress has said a particular class of people get the 

attorneys' fees out of the security insofar as the 

security will support it. It doesn't say a word about 

what happens to the attorneys' fees after the security 

is exhausted, nor about anybody else's attorneys' fees, 

where so provided by contract. Colliers says they can 

get it.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, Congress said 

JUSTICE BREYER: Same puzzlement.

MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, Congress has 

said no such thing. What Congress says is that an 

allowed claim is allowed as of the date of the filing of 

the petition. That is when you value the claim and you 

value the claim as of the date of the filing of the 

petition. At that point, it is worth zero because no 

post-petition attorneys' fees have been incurred. And 

the fact of the matter is it may well have never 

occurred to the drafters of the code when --

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose I sell you a house 

and I make a promise that I'll fix any leaks in the 

bathroom. And lo and behold, before there's a leak 

the -- I'm bankrupt. And while I'm bankrupt it floods, 

the bathroom. No claim?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, that is a 

claim. It is a --

JUSTICE BREYER: It is a contingent claim. 

And you're saying this is the same.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I'm saying -- they are 

saying this is a contingent claim. If -- and it is a 

very strange sort of a contingency. It is Travelers 

saying, we have a claim, it is a contingent claim; the 

contingency is whether tomorrow morning we're going to 

pick up the phone and called Weil Gotshal to monitor the 

bankruptcy proceeding.

But let's assume it is a contingent claim. 

It is still a disallowed claim and Congress provided 

numerous statutory indications that it was. I already 

mentioned 506(b) but there are more. Congress said that 

attorneys' fees are available only, quote, "to the 

extent that a claim is oversecured." Now that would be 

a very --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. It's quite 

unlike the situation, for example in Timbers, where had 

you in 502 a disallowance of post-petition interest. 

There is not in 502 a disallowance of attorneys' fees.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, I was 

just going to get there. Timbers underscores this 

proposition. Timbers focused on the structure of 506 

and it began with and it underscored, the only words 

that it underscored were, "to the extent that." But let 

me turn to that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, Timbers cited, as 

the Chief Justice indicates, the interest section in 

506. That's all it's about. I don't -- I think Timbers 

is misleading on this point.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, Timbers has the 

structural argument that focuses on what the purpose of 

506(b) is. But there are more indications. It would be 

odd for Congress, for example, to draft this provision

506(b) that purports to put post-petition attorneys' 

fees on the same footing at post-petition interest if it 

intended to put them on different footings. It's an 

observation this Court made in Ron Pair. Moreover, 

Congress was not oblivious to the existence of 

attorneys' fees post-petition. There are 15 occasions 

in the code where Congress spoke to attorneys' fees and 

if Congress had intended attorneys' fees to be available 

to this enormous class of unsecured creditors, one would 

think that it would not have hidden that in the 

definition of "claim" --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, are those 15 places 

-- do they involve attorneys' fees as administrative 

expenses? Do any of them involve attorneys' fees simply 

as an unsecured claim for attorneys' fees?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, as to 

creditors, four of them apply to attorneys' fees as 

administrative expenses. It's a very important point 

because the code says and it adopts this age old rule 

that if you are going to take money away from some 

unsecured creditors and give it to attorneys it better 

be because you're expanding the pot for all of the other 

creditors.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What's the answer to my 

question? Is the answer that 11 of them say you can

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, for the, for 

creditors there are only six that apply. Four of them 

are the administrative.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, so six.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So six are administrative, 

and then the remaining two say that the creditor can 

collect it as an unsecured debt?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Which are those two?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, one of them does.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Which is that?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That is the provision that 

Travelers cites -- and I apologize it's not in any of 

the appendices -- 502(b)(4). And 502(b)(4) underscores 

our point. 502(b)(4) says, and I'm quoting directly 

from the code: "A claim is allowed to the" -- "is 

disallowed to the extent that," and then "(4) if such 

claim is for services of an insider or attorney and such 

claim exceeds the reasonable value of such services." 

That is focused on pre-petition activities of the 

lawyers on behalf of the debtor.

way because it says it's disallowed insofar as it's 

unreasonable of course, and therefore it would be 

allowed insofar as it's reasonable.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, yes. Pre-petition

the petition.

debtor.

interested that you said there are 11 other provisions 

that we could look at for support, and I wouldn't think 

it was support if those consider -- concern 

administrative expenses, which nobody's asking for here, 

they just want an unsecured claim, or if they concern 

some other --

MR. ROSENKRANZ: Fair enough Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- irrelevant thing.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Fair enough, Your Honor. 

My point is that Congress knew about attorneys' fees and 

if it wanted this huge class of unsecured creditors to 

collect their attorneys' fees for post-petition 

activities, it wouldn't have hidden that in a general

definition of claim or in the general statement of 

allowability.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your 

brother in his reply brief said that no court of appeals 

has endorsed your theory, and I -- earlier you told me 

one had. Which one in particular?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, the First 

Circuit -- there are three courts of appeals that have 

addressed the question, all in dictum but in very 

extensive dictum. So the First Circuit comes out our 

way in Adams versus Zimmerman. The Second Circuit comes 

out also in dictum on Travelers' side in United 

Merchants. And then the Sixth Circuit splits the baby 

in half, or reads the code all the way up to our 

position as we do, and then takes a detour in another 

direction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you really want 

us to reach out and decide a question that's not 

presented when there has been no holding of the court of 

appeals one way or the other on the issue?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, we didn't come 

here asking this Court to address this question. 

Travelers put it front and center. They conceded --

MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, it would 

have made no sense for us to argue that Fobian was wrong 

when we were trying to defend the judgment below. But I 

concede, Your Honor, this Court has discretion to decide 

whether it's going to address what we believe is an 

absolute factual predicate, and what Travelers seems --

I'm sorry, legal predicate -- and what Travelers seems 

to believe is a legal predicate, which is why we're 

saying to the Court this case, this issue has been 

ventilating for 20 years, and a lot of mischief can be 

JUSTICE BREYER: How -- can we decide? But 

I'm wondering about, maybe you don't want to answer 

this, but I mean, if we were to say Fobian is wrong, 

everybody will agree with us. But we should have to say 

why it's wrong. And if we say the reason that it's 

wrong is because you can't collect attorneys' fees at 

all, you'll be delighted. And if we say the reason it's 

wrong is because you can collect attorneys' fees 

regardless, they'll be delighted. And our only other 

alternative is to not say why it's wrong or -- I mean, 

that's the problem.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That's exactly --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an added 

complication. There's another case on which the Ninth

Circuit's based its decision in your case, DeRoche. 

Your proposed solution here doesn't address the issue in 

DeRoche because there it's the debtor that's seeking 

attorneys' fees.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Absolutely, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we still have to 

decide the Fobian issue. And your failure to defend it 

here means that we're going to have to decide in on that 

inadequate record. If you have mentioned that in an 

opposition to certiorari, perhaps we would have granted 

cert in the DeRoche case and had an argument about the 

rule that we have to decide.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I appreciate 

that, and I apologize for not having raised it in the 

cert petition, cert opposition, we were simply focused 

on why it is that this little sliver of the Fobian rule 

was not worth this Court's attention. But I understand 

that this Court needs to look forward and try and figure 

out what exactly the issues are that are presented. I 

only add that the statutory question that is presented 

in DeRoche and in this case are as Your Honor has 

pointed out, mirror images of each other.

 So whatever this Court decides as to the 

statutory construction question on 502(b), this Court 

can say it's not resolving Fobian because this is a

predicate question. And this Court can say there may 

well be circumstances in which a creditor can say, you 

know what, for State law litigation we have this common 

law right, and we reserve for a later day the question 

of whether there is an exception to the statutory rule 

that we are articulating.

 Now I want to underscore that Congress had 

very important reasons that are built into the code for 

coming out this way and disallowing unsecured creditors 

attorneys' fees. Bear in mind that these sorts of fee 

shifting provisions are absolutely ubiquitous. They are 

in every credit card contract. They are in every bank 

loan. They are in virtually any written contract, and 

when a contract doesn't provide for it, quite often 

State law statutes do. Allowing all of these unsecured 

creditors to pay their lawyers out of the hides of all 

of the other unsecured creditors --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but that's not the 

facts of this case. Isn't that correct?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE STEVENS: This will not have any 

adverse, if I understand the facts, any adverse impact 

whatsoever on any unsecured creditor.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, on the facts of 

this case if the rule had been otherwise, we don't know

whether PG&E would have been solvent at all. But we are 

arguing about a rule that is not one rule for Travelers 

and one rule for everyone else. We are arguing about a 

rule for the vast majority of cases.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but just looking at 

this case itself, if there is plenty of money there to 

pay a State law obligation, why shouldn't just ordinary 

rules of contract law apply?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, the 

answer is, Congress dealt with this issue and decided 

that no one gets to get in line and get their attorneys' 

fees, regardless of whether they're solvent or not. 

It's a --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're raising a 

provision that says just that, it's the absence of a 

provision for attorneys' fees that you're relying on.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, no, Your Honor. 

We've been talking about why the only natural way to 

read the code is to disallow attorneys' fees, and I'm 

explaining that if attorneys' fees are generally 

disallowed to everyone, there's no exception to that 

rule in the code that says ah, yes, but if there's an 

insolvent -- if there's a solvent debtor, the rule is 

otherwise.

that generally disallows attorneys' fees?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I'm sorry. What I'm saying 

is 502(b) when you read "as of the time of the filing of 

the petition," it says -- that means, that must mean 

that it doesn't apply to post-petition attorneys' fees, 

especially when you look at 502(b) through the lens, as 

this Court did in Timbers, of the rest of the code. 

506(b), all of these other attorneys' fees --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on that point you 

disagree with the Collier citation at page 9 of the 

reply brief then?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, I disagree 

with Colliers, but I don't think Colliers comes out one 

way or another on this particular question. That was 

the same question that was asked earlier about whether 

it's a claim, whether it's a pre-petition claim.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it says if the 

creditor incurs the attorneys' fees post petition in 

connection with protecting a pre-petition claim --

MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the fees will be 

pre-petition.

Your Honor. I was referring to another provision of 

Colliers, not the one that's cited in the reply brief. 

That is a correct statement but it has no application 

here because we are not arguing about whether it's a 

pre-petition obligation. Of course it's a pre-petition 

obligation. Just like pre-petition interest -- excuse 

me -- post-petition interest is a pre-petition 

obligation we are arguing that the code cancels that 

obligation because there are very important reasons, 

such as equality among all unsecured creditors, the --

JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying this 

particular set of pre-petition obligations. Collier, I 

think in context must be saying, you get paid the money. 

I mean, he goes on in the next sentence and says by the 

way, despite my last sentence, you don't get the money?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor. What 

Colliers is talking about is a completely different 

question. He doesn't answer that question one way or 

another in Colliers.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, in other words what he 

implies, if I ready the whole page I'll see, although he 

just said what we quoted, the whole page means, by the 

way, I'm not telling you if you get the money or not?

-- I mean, and you'd have to say well, 506(b) simply 

repeats 506(a), as sometimes provisions do, and then it 

becomes somewhat superfluous, somewhat not. I got that 

point. I also have your point about, well, there are 

other references. Now, is there any other point in the 

code?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. There is 

one other point and that is, 502(c) tells the court what 

it is supposed to do with contingent claims. It is 

supposed to either liquidate them or estimate them. 

These are -- this is a very strange sort of contingency, 

as I mentioned earlier.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not in the 

materials, 502(c)?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 502(c) is, Your Honor. 

It's on the very back of the cert petition appendix on 

page, I believe 28. And so it says either estimate or 

liquidate, but always as of the date of the filing of 

the petition. Now as of the date of the filing of the

 JUSTICE BREYER: How do they do it with my 

leaky bathroom?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, what you do is 

-- that is a classic contingency. What you do is to 

estimate the likelihood that the bathroom will in fact 

leak and the cost of those expenses, and you put 

something into the, into the bankruptcy estate for that 

purpose. That would be something that Congress would 

never have wanted to do with thousands and thousands of 

unsecured creditors.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I am concerned about 

your point that there are all kinds of attorneys' fees 

contracts out there and if everybody can get fees for 

filing the claim post-petition act, we have a huge 

amount of claims to pay.

 Travelers would tell us, though, that a 

surety is different, that they somehow stand in the 

shoes of PG&E or something.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I don't 

understand why a surety is different from any other 

contract. All contractual creditors will want their 

fees. The reason that they haven't been applying for 

them is that the overwhelming majority of bankruptcy 

courts will tell you no, you can't have them, because

the overwhelming majority of cases have been saying 

exactly what I'm saying to you. 502(b) does not allow 

them, and we can tell that by looking at 506(b).

 And there are other reasons that Congress 

would not have wanted to do that. It would have 

burdened the administration of the state -- of the 

estate. The court would be spending more time 

administering claims about fees and what does this 

contract mean, and fees upon fees upon fees, than it 

would be spending administering the basic bankruptcy 

estate.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, of course the 

argument here is that this is something different from 

the general abuse that you're describing, because the 

plan didn't make any provision here for, for paying the 

workers comp obligation at all. What is your response 

to that?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, my response is 

that is absolutely wrong. The first draft of the plan 

which you can see on page 28 of the appendix says 

explicitly, and I quote, "all workers compensation 

programs are treated as executory contract." Treated as 

executory contracts and deemed assumed by the debtor, 

and that means that the workers got the most favorable 

treatment that they could have gotten. These are not

just unsecured claims.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your friend says 

it's more favorable to say the claims are unimpaired.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, that's what 

they argued. The bankruptcy court explicitly held 

otherwise and the Ninth Circuit agreed with the 

bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court said, none of 

your interventions were reasonably necessary to reach --

excuse me -- to advance your interests. Therefore, you 

are absolutely wrong when you argue to us that you are 

on the State law side of the Fobian rule.

 Now if you ask me, Your Honor, where in the 

bankruptcy court decision does it say that, I would 

refer the Court to page 24a of the -- of the cert 

petition appendix, where you see asterisks for a missing 

paragraph right in the middle of the opinion. That, and 

just to orient the Court, we're looking at the first 

paragraph that says first of all. Then there's a --

there is an asterisk eliminating a paragraph. Look at 

page 140a, 141 of the joint appendix where the missing 

paragraph that Travelers eliminated is filled in, and 

there the court summarizes a 15-page colloquy with 

Travelers about why it is completely wrong in claiming 

that its steps were reasonably necessary.

again, you see that it begins, second paragraph, first 

of all. That's the same paragraph. The next paragraph 

refers to Mr. Brunstad's arguments. It says, "I just 

simply don't by it. I don't think you can sort of say, 

you know, we thought there was a thief hiding under the 

bed so we had to clear out under the bed. I don't think 

there was a risk there." And that was the gist of 15 

pages proceeding the joint appendix, where the court 

methodically demolishes each of the argument Travelers 

presents here.

 Thank you, Your Honor.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer, in our brief 

on pages 25 and 26, we cite to a number of cases where 

the courts allowed attorneys' fees as an unsecured 

claim, both for pre-petition work done and also 

post-petition work done where the contractual right was 

pre-petitioned. We also cite a bunch of cases around 

page 44 -- 43 and 44 of our brief, including an article 

in the middle of page 44, quote: "In cases decided 

under the Bankruptcy Act, the higher courts consistently 

held that attorneys' fees were allowable even as

unsecured claims in bankruptcy." Close quote. I've 

been a bankruptcy lawyer for over 20 years. I've been 

teaching bankruptcy law for 17 years. It is absolutely 

not true that courts routinely disallow claims for 

attorneys' fees as part of unsecured claims. It's the 

opposite is true it's routine that they are allowed in 

practical reality however they are not presented because 

creditors don't bother to present them because 

distributions are generally so low in bankruptcy.

 On the point about the plan completely 

protected the rights of the injured workers, nothing 

could be farther from the truth. The provision that 

counsel cites in the plan refers to exec, as executory 

contracts, workers' compensation benefit programs. 

Those are the contractual relationships between PG&E and 

its administrators, not the claims of the workers 

themselves. Tellingly, PG&E never argued in the 

bankruptcy court that the claims of the workers were 

fine under the plan. In fact, they said, we will do 

what Travelers wants after the bankruptcy court directed 

-- and it's in the transcript -- that that was the 

appropriate thing to do.

 In fact, what Travelers insisted is 

required by Section 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code, claims 

such as the workers' must be classified, their treatment

must be specified. If they are not they are eliminated.

 The reference to executory contracts 

clearly doesn't apply. As we explain in our reply 

brief, the workers' claims were not executory contracts 

under applicable law. That section does not apply.

 Of course, I think, Chief Justice 

Roberts, there is a lot more that we would like to say 

about their alternative arguments than we were able to 

put in our 20-page reply brief. The issue that they 

raised has not been fully ventilated in the lower 

courts. In fact, there are many more things we would 

say about it on remand.

 I also think it's important to point out, 

Justice Stevens, they are a solvent debtor, and under 

the concept of absolute priority shareholders are not 

allowed to recover anything unless creditors are paid in 

full. What they are trying to do is they're trying to 

get rid of their contractual obligations in bankruptcy 

for the benefit of their shareholders. There's no 

implication between creditors, creditors' recoveries in 

this case one versus the other.

 In the Dow Corning case which we cite in 

our reply brief the Sixth Circuit expressly held where 

you have a solvent debtor you have to pay all of the 

attorneys' fees. That is an additional argument we

would develop on remand.

 But all of their arguments about Section 

506 and their interpretation of 502 simply don't matter, 

because as a solvent debtor they're not entitled to take 

advantage of that theory even if it were valid. And we 

contend that it isn't valid. The court of appeals have 

resoundingly rejected it. The Second Circuit rejected 

it in United Merchants and Manufacturers. The Sixth 

Circuit rejected it in Dow Corning. The Eleventh 

Circuit it en banc in the Wellsville case. All of them 

considered the 506 argument that they're making and 

rejected it, and properly so.

 Counsel cites to Section 502(b)(4). 

That's an important section because that demonstrates 

that Congress understood that attorneys' fees would be 

allowable as an unsecured claim under Section 502. And 

in Section 502(b)(4) it provided the only exception, the 

only one where attorneys' fees would not be allowable as 

an unsecured claim. It provided expressly attorneys' 

fees would not be allowable for the attorney for the 

debtor to the extent the claim for the fees exceeded the 

reasonable value of the services performed. Why is that 

provision there? Because Congress saw there was a 

problem. There was a problem of debtors sending money 

to their attorneys. Congress understood that to be a

problem and it remedied it.

 Congress did not think there was a 

problem with respect to this historic practice of going 

on over 100 years of attorneys' fees being allowed as 

unsecured claims, and so in Section 502 it allows them. 

Respondents' argument about Section 506(b) renders 

Section 502(b)(4) superfluous. If attorneys' fees were 

never allowable as part of an unsecured claim except for 

how 506(b) allows it, then there would not be a need for 

Section 502(b)(4). In addition, Respondent overstates 

the office of Section 506. 506, as this Court explained 

in Ron Pair, provides, essentially tells us what secured 

creditors get out of their collateral and in what order 

-- the pre-petition amount and then, if there's any 

value left, the value of the collateral. After you pay 

the pre-petition amount of the claim, you can add 

attorneys' fees and you can add, post-petition you can 

add interest. Their interpretation of Section 506(b) 

would render Section 502(b)(2) superfluous. Under their 

theory, only oversecured creditors get post-petition 

interest, get interest.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you prevail, why can't 

every attorney who represents a creditor who has a 

credit card or a promissory note providing for 

attorneys' fees file something in bankruptcy and get

attorneys' fees for the filing of the claim?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: That already happens, Justice 

Kennedy. In all the circuits that recognize that 

attorneys' fees are allowed as unsecured claims, that 

already happens. And that has not cause any disaster or 

any problem. It's been a practice for 100 years. If 

Congress had wished to change the practice, it would 

have when it codified the Bankruptcy Code in 1979. The 

fact that it hasn't perceived it to be a problem 

demonstrates that Congress wanted to leave the practice 

unchanged.

 Now, what happens, though, again, Justice 

Kennedy, is that creditors don't bother to file claims 

for those amounts. And where it matters is in cases 

where it should matter, like in this case, in the PG&E 

case, where a solvent debtor is simply trying to get out 

of its contractual relationships. And under principles 

of absolute priority they are not allowed to do that for 

the benefit of shareholders where creditors are not 

being paid in full. And I think it's important to 

underscore again, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's interesting. You're 

of course a teacher too. The amicus brief by a bunch of 

professors has a different view of the history than 

you're describing.

MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Stevens, what I take, 

what I take from their analysis is a hostility towards 

attorneys' fees being allowed in bankruptcy. And 

perhaps maybe as a matter of policy, if we were to start 

from scratch, well, maybe we shouldn't allow attorneys' 

fees to be allowed in bankruptcy. Maybe we shouldn't 

allow tort claims to be allowed in bankruptcy. Maybe we 

shouldn't allow certain kinds of environmental claims to 

be allowed in bankruptcy. They don't like the rule, 

apparently, but their analysis of the history is wrong.

 And we cite innumerable cases and law review 

articles that demonstrate that the practice is as we say 

that it is. And policy reasons are no grounds to sort 

of create these Federal common law rules or these 

categorical rules of preclusions.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you say a word about 

Justice Holmes' opinion in the Scruggs case.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Yes, Justice Stevens. The 

Randolph case was decided in 1903 and the law changed 

dramatically since then. For example, in 1903 

contingent claims were not provable under the Bankruptcy 

Act. That changed in 1938 when contingent claims became 

provable under the Bankruptcy Act.

 Randolph & Randolph versus Scruggs involved 

the claim of a custodian, a custodian, an assignee, who

took control of all the debtor's assets before the 

bankruptcy filing. Now under Section 503(b)(3)(E), the 

Randolph versus Scruggs analysis as it pertains to the 

claims of the assignee, those are now treated as an 

administrative expense under Section 503 dealing with 

administrative expenses.

 In Randolph, it's interesting, the fees --

Justice Kennedy, the fees incurred in preparing the 

assignment were allowed as an unsecured claim in the 

bankruptcy case. Justice Holmes for the Court said they 

are allowed. So in fact Randolph I think refutes their 

analysis rather than supports it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
