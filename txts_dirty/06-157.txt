 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument this morning in case 06-157, Hein versus 

Freedom From Religion Foundation.

 General Clement.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 In Flast against Cohen, this Court 

recognized narrow circumstances in which a taxpayer 

could satisfy the requirements of Article III in 

challenging a congressional exercise of its spending and 

taxing authority. This court in doing so rejected the 

suggestion of Justice Douglas that it allow all 

taxpayers to sue in all manner of claims, as well as the 

slightly more modest suggestion of Justices Stewart and 

Fortas that the Court allow taxpayer standing for all 

establishment clause challenges.

 This Court's subsequent cases such as Valley 

Forge have made clear just how narrow the rule of Flast 

is. In order for a taxpayer to satisfy the requirements 

of Article III, the taxpayer must challenge a 

congressional exercise of the taxing and spending

authority, and assert that the act of spending itself is 

what gives rise to the establishment clause violation. 

The court of appeals in the decision below substantially 

expanded the scope of taxpayer standing and in doing so, 

the court adopted a doctrine that I think can fairly be 

only understood as an exception to, not an application 

of normal principles of Article III standing.

 The court did so on the rationale that there 

is much that the executive branch can do to violate 

the establishment cause, but there is much that all 

three branches of Government could conceivably do to 

violate the establishment clause, and that has never 

been thought a sufficient reason to extend taxpayer 

standing to all Government action, nor has it been 

thought a sufficient reason to relax the irreducible 

minimum requirements of Article III.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If I understand your 

position correctly, if Congress enacts a program that 

favors religion over non-religion, which is supposedly 

what the establishment clause prohibits, that's bad; but 

if Congress enacts a perfectly valid general program and 

the President implements it in a fashion that favors 

religion over non-religion, that's okay, insofar as the 

ability of anybody to challenge it is concerned. Is 

that an accurate description?

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think so, 

Justice Scalia. I mean, first of all --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I mean, I think that may 

be sort of over inclusive and under inclusive.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Which is to say, it's not 

a congressional program, it's a congressional spending 

statute that is the key predicate. And then once 

there's a congressional spending program, whether it's 

facial challenge or an as-apply challenge that relies on 

an intervening ministerial act of the executive branch, 

taxpayer standing will lie under this Court's precedent.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If this -- if Congress 

had enacted this executive order that's in question 

here, if it had been congressional legislation, would 

there be standing?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think so, 

Justice Ginsburg, but let me just be clear. I don't 

think it's just a matter of this executive order that's 

challenged in this case and Congress could have enacted 

that into statute. As I understand it, the -- what is 

really at issue here is not the executive order. It is 

the way that certain conferences were conducted by 

executive branch officials. That's what the dispute --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I had the same question as 

Justice Ginsburg, and I think was also suggested by 

Justice Scalia's question. Suppose that Congress passed 

a statute that said we hereby appropriate a million 

dollars to the President to use to call religious 

conferences, and then it spelled out these conferences. 

Is there standing there?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think so, 

Justice Kennedy, because I look at this Court's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But --and I of course want 

the answer, but then, why is that consistent with what 

you told us at the beginning that there had to be a 

statute?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Because there has to be 

two things. There has to be a statute. And then there 

has to be an allegation that the statute creates a 

unique injury in the context of spending that affects 

taxpayers differently than anybody -- than any other 

citizen. And if you have a situation like your 

hypothetical statue, where you don't have any spending 

that goes outside of the Government, then you might have 

an establishment clause problem, but it wouldn't be an 

establishment clause problem where the nub of the 

problem is the fact that money is spent. Because if 

there's a problem with what's going --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're saying if the 

Government, the executive, or the Congress, if the 

congressional statute authorizes the giving of money for 

the billing of a church, that's bad; but if it 

authorizes -- it makes a general authorization to the 

President -- no. If the congressional statute says the 

Government will build a church, that's okay, because 

then the money doesn't go outside the Government?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, importantly, 

Justice Scalia, it's not a matter of it being okay. 

It's a question of whether it logically --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, as far as standing is 

concerned.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Yeah, it logically gives 

rise to taxpayer standing. So -- and I think there is 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What is your answer to 

that? That in fact it's bad in the first situation and 

okay in the second, as far as standing is concerned?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: What I would say is in 

either case it's bad. I would say that there is 

taxpayer standing to challenge the disbursement of funds 

outside the Government but not your horrible 

hypothetical about an internal Government church.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is no standing for

the internal Government church?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Not taxpayer standing. 

Anybody who's subjected to the mass at the church 

probably has standing as a matter of direct --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, we're not forcing 

anybody in at gunpoint. We're just building a 

Government church.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, 

Justice Scalia, nobody forced Van Orden to walk by the 

Ten Commandments display in Texas at gunpoint, and yet 

this Court said that he could bring an establishment 

clause challenge. So I think there would be directly 

injured people who could challenge your sort of end of 

the slippery slope --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But we're talking taxpayer 

standing. And you think there is a real difference 

insofar as whether the taxpayer is harmed between the 

Congress saying we're going to give the money to a 

religious organization to build a church and Congress 

saying we're going to build a church. You really think 

there's a difference?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think there's a 

difference in the extent to which there is a 

conceptually direct injury for the taxpayer as taxpayer. 

The citizens are clearly injured when the Government

sets up the church.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: In both cases money is 

being used for a purpose that is contrary to the 

establishment clause, according to the taxpayer.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: But with respect, in the 

context of the internal Government church, the fact that 

money is being spent to establish that church is the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Taxpayer money.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- least of your concerns. 

It's the fact that the Government is establishing it 

that's the principal concern.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care whether it's 

the least of the concerns, it's a concern. It's the 

same establishment clause concern in both cases. Now 

you may well be correct that there's a freedom of 

religion clause violation in one case and not in the 

other, but as far as the establishment clause violation, 

I find it difficult to understand the difference between 

the two.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I 

think it's a difference suggested by this Court's cases, 

and they do make an important distinction between the 

distribution of money outside the Government where the 

spending itself is the injury and what this Court has 

termed the incidental expenditure of money in the

context of an executive branch activity that itself is 

alleged to violate the establishment clause.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And why should that make 

any difference if the entire theory behind it is sort of 

a Madisonian theory, if not threepence from the pocket 

for a religious purpose? If you start with the 

Madisonian view, there should be no distinction of the 

two cases that Justice Scalia puts.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I'm not quite sure that's 

right, Justice Souter, because I think that there's 

really two ways the Government can establish religion. 

One is they can do it themselves directly. And if they 

do that, I think that the primary problem is the primary 

executive branch conduct in doing so. The other way 

they can establish --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but let's talk about 

establishing -- maybe this is what you're going to do, 

establishing religion by spending the threepence.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Exactly. And that is 

precisely what --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And in this case, when you 

build the church, you're spending the threepence whether 

-- whether a -- a Government employee is laying the 

bricks or a contract -- an outside contractor is laying 

the bricks or a third party institution to which a grant

has been made is laying the bricks. It's the same 

threepence.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect in the one 

respect it is the three pence itself that is the 

establishment violation. It is the act of handing 

Government money into the coffers --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Taking the money out of the 

pocket and using it for a particular purpose, and the 

money comes out of the pocket in each case. The purpose 

is the same in each case.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Again, I would take issue 

with that and say the primary concern that Madison was 

focused on was the taking of the money and then giving 

it to the outside religious entity.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would -- you've covered 

the case where the Government itself, the executive is 

the actor and said that's not covered by Flast. But it 

is covered -- what is covered is if the give the money 

directly to the religious organization.

 If the money goes instead of to the 

Government -- take this case, if the conferences are run 

by a private contractor -- contractor with the 

executive, where would that fall?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think it might depend on 

the nature of the claim actually. If the nature of the

claim --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: This claim, these 

conferences are run now instead of within the executive 

branch by various agencies, they are run by contractors, 

specialists in conferences that have been engaged by the 

executive to help people make grant applications.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: But I think the better 

view, is the challenge is exactly this one, which is not 

that there's something wrong with the recipient, but 

that there's something wrong with what goes on at these 

conferences. Then in that context, I don't think there 

would be -- standing --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's --that's a 

question on the merits. Right now we have to take the 

allegations of the complaint on the merits as -- the 

allegation is, I take it, that religious organizations 

are being favored over secular organizations; but that's 

a merits question.

 You've -- you've -- you have been clear that 

if the Government itself spends the money, then there's 

no standing. You've, you've been clear that if it gives 

the money to the religious group, there is standing.

 Now money is going outside the Government. 

Going outside the Government. But is not going to the

religious organization. Where do you fit that?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Again, I think if I 

understand the question, I would say that there's no 

taxpayer standing there. And I think -- but, but and I 

apologize for sort of bleeding over into the merits. 

But with all due respect, I don't think you can really 

meaningfully talk about the Flast nexus test without 

bleeding over a little bit into the merits, because the 

Court did it itself in Flast. And what I would say is 

if you have a challenge where the problem is that it's 

the very act of money going to the third party 

conference organizers that's the problem, then it really 

is a spending case, and I think the taxpayer standing 

would logically lie.

 But if it's really, what the concern here is 

the primary conduct of what was done at the conferences, 

and not the fact that there's spending on the 

conferences at all, then I think it's more -- it is a 

case there would not be taxpayer standing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There wouldn't be 

tax -- taxpayer standing, but of course there would be 

regular Article III standing in the sense that in a 

party claiming to be injured because they didn't get a 

grant, and a religious organization did, and the reason 

was religion, can bring any kind of claim they want

under Article III. It's just they wouldn't qualify for 

the special exception to the general rule that there is 

no taxpayer standing for establishment clause cases.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: That's exactly right. And 

it's a very important point. Because for example, when 

this Court recognized that the Bible reading in Doremus 

did not give rise to taxpayer standing, that didn't stop 

the parents who were directly injured by the same 

practice in Shemp from bringing an establishment 

clause --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- just one, one more 

question on this, on this line. And I won't belabor the 

hypothetical. Again there's a Federal statute for this 

conference, and the moneys go for air tickets to various 

religious ministers and priests. Does that meet your 

outside the Government test for standing?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think there would be 

taxpayer standing if I understand that. And I realize 

that, you know, one could say well, that's is a fairly 

artificial distinction. But I do think that it is 

suggested by this Court's precedents and the reason that 

it makes sense is that when you have injury -- where the 

real injury is the spending, the fact that you're not 

supposed to pay for plane tickets for ministers, that's 

an establishment clause injury, then it makes sense to

say that people that provided that money in the in the 

first place have a distinct injury.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But not -- but not if the 

President just gives the money out of a general 

appropriation, authorizing him to give money to people 

who are helping in the programs that the Faith-Based 

Initiative was -- was designed to help?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If the President hands over 

the money, that's okay?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Not necessarily, 

Justice Scalia, but it's important to focus on what this 

case is about.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why, why not necessarily? 

I thought that was your -- you proposition, that it has 

to be a congressional violation not an executive.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Right. And it would 

depend a little bit on about where the President is 

getting the money. I think the way that we would look 

at it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He's getting the money from 

Congress under a general, under a general appropriation. 

If he takes this money and he says here, use it for a 

religious purpose, that's okay?

JUSTICE SCALIA: As far as standing is 

concerned, he can't be sued?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: If he, if he's taking it 

from a general appropriation that makes no indication 

it's to go outside the Government so one could not in 

any way articulate that as an as-applied challenge to 

the appropriations, then I suppose that there would not 

be standing. But I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand. I'm 

back -- I really -- I'm surprised. And it's probably my 

fault. But that I thought -- I started where 

Justice Scalia was with his first question. I thought 

this had something to do with whether Congress passed a 

statute or the President acted on his own. But 

listening to you now I think, I can't decide -- I think 

you have a different argument.

 Suppose -- I'm just trying to understand. 

Suppose that Congress passes a law and it says it's a 

very nice thing to commemorate the Pilgrims by building 

a Government church at Plymouth Rock, where we will have 

the regular worship in the Puritan religion. Now can a 

taxpayer from California in your view challenge that?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I would say that that's a 

much harder case than this --

say no, no.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? Because I thought 

Flast made clear that they could.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No. What Flast makes 

clear is that you can challenge a congressional statute 

that is a taxing and spending statute. And I think to 

understand the circumstances in which you should give 

rise to taxpayer standing, you need two things: You 

need a congressional statute that is an exercise of the 

taxing and spending authority; but then you need the 

money to go outside the Government.

 And that's precisely what --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then you go to a private 

group?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Right. Because there's, 

again, there's two ways --

JUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying that if 

the Government has the most amazing, let's -- I'm trying 

to think of something more amazing that what I just 

thought of.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: All over America, they 

build churches dedicated to one religion; and Congress 

passes a statute and says in every city, town, and

hamlet, we are going to have a minister, a Government 

minister, a Government church, and dedicated to the 

proposition that this particular sect is the true sect; 

and they pass a statute like that, nobody could 

challenge it?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Horrible hypothetical.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that what you're saying, 

then?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I mean, I think the bottom 

line is that there would not be taxpayer standing. 

Plenty of people could probably challenge that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know, I mean --

GENERAL CLEMENT: Probably --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- everybody else who 

doesn't want to go just avoids it. So that they don't 

have to do anything. They just have to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any, presumably any 

other denomination that is not of the established church 

could bring a challenge that they're being discriminated 

against, because they're favoring a particular church 

over them. Your proposition is simply that somebody --

somebody in Oregon can't challenge the fact that they're 

building a church in Florida simply because the person 

in Florida pays taxes, right?

Florida all have the same amount of standing. No, what 

we're saying is plenty of people would be able to 

challenge that. But not --

suggested I think anybody from a different denomination 

that said that this was discriminatory probably could 

bring a claim. I also think that anybody who walked 

into one of those churches could bring a claim. And 

again, this Court -- this Court --

JUSTICE BREYER: Maybe they don't walk into 

it because it is not "our church." So they don't walk 

into it.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, we --

JUSTICE BREYER: And moreover, they don't --

they don't feel it's discriminatory. It's just we're 

doing this to commemorate the Pilgrims, and we'll give 

the money to any group that's a Pilgrim.

 (Laughter.)

 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect -- with 

respect, Justice Breyer, I think you're underestimating 

the ingenuity of plaintiffs to think that somebody that 

walked by going to Plymouth Rock okay thinking I was 

going to see a nice historical exhibit, and is and to

there wouldn't be Article III standing for that 

particular individual, not the taxpayer --

JUSTICE ALITO: General Clement, are you --

are arguing that these lines that you're drawing make a 

lot of sense in an abstract sense? Or are you just 

arguing that this is the best that can be done that this 

is the best that can be done within the body of 

precedent that the Court has handed down in this area?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: The latter, Justice Alito.

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think -- as a 

matter of first course, the Court tries. And here -- if 

I could put the precedents on the map, though, I do 

think they make a modicum of sense in the following way. 

You start with Flast. Flast says that you can bring a 

challenge to a congressional spending statute. Okay, 

fair enough. Valley Forge comes along and says that 

you, that you don't have taxpayer standing to challenge 

an executive branch action. Now that raises a very 

obvious --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The difference was that 

it was because it was under the property clause, and 

made a distinction between property and money.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: We are talking about 

money, not property?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: But Justice Ginsburg, in 

fairness, the Court could not have been more clear in 

Valley Forge that there were two reasons that there 

weren't taxpayer standing there. One was there was a 

challenge to Executive Branch action. The second was 

that it was the property clause rather than the spending 

clause.

 Now, you could sort of take the view that 

the third of the cases, Kendrick, overrules the first

aspect of the decision in Valley Forge. Now I think 

that's wrong. I think the way to understand Kendrick is 

as follows: You have a decision that says you can --

you can challenge congressional spending, not Executive 

Branch action. That naturally poses the question what 

about an as-applied challenge to a spending statute? 

Surely, I mean, because spending is something only the 

Congress does, and disbursement is a ministerial act 

that only the Executive does, what do you do when 

there's an intervening ministerial act of disbursement? 

Does that mean that it's still an as-applied challenge 

to the spending statute? Or does --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was it just --

GENERAL CLEMENT: That mean that it's 

Executive Branch action?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was it just a ministerial 

act or did the Executive have discretion involved, about 

who would receive the grant?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, 

two things. One, in Bowen, there was -- there is 

certainly always a degree of discretion. But it is 

worth noting that in Bowen as in Flast, the statute 

itself on its face made clear that money was to go to 

outside entities that were religious. In Bowen it did 

so in express terms by four times referring to religious

organizations. In Flast it did so by saying money was 

going to go, or in-kind aid, rather, was to going to go 

to private schools. And that was at a time when this 

Court roughly contemporaneously, in Lemon v Kurtzman 

that 93 percent of the private schools were religious. 

The both of those, the gravamen of what's the complaint, 

that money is being spent by Congress on religious 

entities, was not within the discretion of the Executive 

Branch.

 And again, the way I would understand 

Kendrick is simply reconciling Valley Forge and Flast 

and Cohen to preserve, not broad challenges to Executive 

Branch action, which would have overruled Valley Forge, 

but rather to simply preserve the notion that you can 

bring an as-applied challenge to a spending statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you can reconcile 

Valley Forge simply by saying when it's money from the 

Federal Treasury, whether it is a general appropriation 

or a specific appropriation, it is money from the 

Treasury, and that's what Flast is about. Because 

whether it is spent by the Executive under an Executive 

program, which you have said can violate the 

establishment clause as well as a congressional program.

 So why isn't that the line to draw based on 

Flast, that it's money from the Treasury that makes the

difference?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, it 

is certainly not the line I would draw from reading 

these cases side by side and together.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or to, or to put it another 

way, to put Justice Ginsburg's point another way, every 

Executive action that involves the expenditure of 

congressionally authorized funds is an as-applied 

challenge to an expenditure statute. Because the only 

way the statute is applied is through executive action. 

And whenever the executive spends the funds improperly, 

you have an as-applied challenge to the congressional 

statute authorizing the funds, whether it's a general 

statute or a -- or a single shot statute.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, I would 

have said that no one would have conceptualized that as 

an as-applied challenge to a general appropriation 

statute. I mean, I guess you would. But I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a --

GENERAL CLEMENT: Even, even if you would do 

that in another case, I don't see how you could do it in 

this case. If you look at their complaint they don't 

identify a single appropriation statute that they take 

issue with. Even before the Tenth -- the Seventh 

Circuit, if you look at page 10 a of the Petitioner's

appendix --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the essence of an 

as-applied challenge. You say the statute's okay. It 

is just what is being done under this statute that is 

bad. You don't have to identify a bad statute. You're 

saying it is a perfectly good statute, but the President 

is -- is violating the Constitution in the way that he's 

applying it.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, 

Justice Scalia, I've never heard of an as-applied 

challenge to a statute that doesn't identity that's 

unconstitutional as applied. And it's your right --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under that, under 

that approach, when a U.S. Marshal executes a search and 

there's a Fourth Amendment claim that the search is 

illegal, that's really a challenge to the appropriation 

of the Marshals Service on an as-applied basis.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: That's exactly right, 

Mr. Chief Justice. And every constitutional right could 

be sort of transmogrified into a claim that oh, that's 

an as-applied appropriations challenge, because the 

Government's not supposed to spend money to do unlawful 

things.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So what's wrong with just 

saying that Flast stands for the proposition that when

the Government spends money in violation of the 

establishment clause, a taxpayer -- after all, the money 

comes from the taxpayer -- can bring a lawsuit? And the 

reason that they do that is because the establishment 

clause is an important joint part of the religion 

clauses; and there'd be no other way to bring such a 

challenge. And sometimes it's that simple principle, 

and when we depart from that principle, say by giving 

property away instead of giving money away, you don't 

have the standing. So we have a pretty clear, simple 

rule. That rule applies whether it's Congress or the 

President acting under congressional authority, et 

cetera, which I think is close to what the other side --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I just add this 

thought before you answer. And isn't that exactly what 

Justice Stewart said in his concurring opinion?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Absolutely. I mean, if 

this Court wants to go the route of Justice Stewart, 

which it pointedly rejected, the majority of the Court 

pointed rejected in Flast, and say, establishment clause 

challenges, we're going to relax the normal Article III 

standard -- now, I'm not quite sure where the Court gets 

the authority to relax the normal Article III standards. 

But assuming that, that would at least be --

case or controversy, because people become terribly 

upset when they see some other religion getting the 

money from the State for the -- for building a church, 

for example, and that's why: There's a real 

controversy.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Getting upset is a 

constitutionally adequate reason to bring a lawsuit? If 

people get upset about spending money for purposes that 

the Federal Government is not allowed to spend money for 

because of States' rights, that also would justify 

Article III standing, wouldn't it?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I suppose under that 

theory, and obviously the plaintiffs in Richardson and 

Schlesinger were very upset as well, and the Court said 

that --

JUSTICE BREYER: It is the kind of upset 

that is a genuine injury if you look to the objectives 

of the establishment clause and possibly that kind of 

genuine injury is not the case when you look to 

objectives of various other clauses of the Constitution.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, let me try 

to answer in two ways if I can. One is to say that that 

way of looking at it takes you even beyond where Justice 

Brennan was in Valley Forge. Even Justice Brennan would 

have drawn the line at what he called bestowals of

Government largesse to third parties.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I was saying. 

I said that Flast then encapsulates that principle drawn 

out of the objectives of the establishment clause in a 

rule; and the rule is what I suggested.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, again, but he --

JUSTICE BREYER: Based on money.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: But again, he didn't say 

just spending of money to do the Executive Branch's 

everyday operations and maybe -- and one day they go a 

little too far in praising religion. He said bestowal 

of Government largesse outside the Government. The 

second point I would make is I still don't understand 

where in just being upset you satisfy the irreducible 

minimum requirements of Article III, and even though 

Flast is probably the outer limit of what's an Article 

III injury under normal principles, there is at least 

what Judge Leventhal in Public Citizen against Simon 

called conceptual directness between the injury to the 

taxpayer and the injury that comes when tax money is 

spent outside the Government to a religious entity. He 

differentiated that from what happens when you have 

general Executive Branch activity that's unlawful, where 

he said there's no similar arrow between the action and 

taxpayers as a class. It's a classic injury that's

inflicted on everybody. It's a generalized grievance, 

which has never been said to satisfy Article III.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're talking about an 

incidental expenditure as part of a regulatory program 

is quite different from looking at a discrete program. 

The Faith-Based Initiative is a discrete program, and 

one component of it is this set of conferences. This is 

not an incidental something pursuant to a large 

regulatory program. Faith-Based Initiative is the name 

of this program.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: But Justice Ginsburg, 

their challenge is not that the money that's spent on 

conferences can't be spent on conferences. Their 

challenge is that what happened at the conference is 

there was too much promotion of religion. The fact that 

the money was spent on the conferences is incidental to 

the gravamen of the complaint.

 If I may save my time for rebuttal.

The Government's argument here is that Flast 

needs major surgery and, as the discussion I think in 

the first part of the argument shows, it's proposing two 

very substantial limitations that bear no relation to 

the relevant establishment clause principles, the 

history of the clause, or the history of this Court's 

decisions. And we think there's no basis for drawing 

the arbitrary lines that the Government suggests. And 

maybe I can follow up on some of the points that my 

colleague made and that the Court made during the 

questioning.

 First of all, with respect to the argument 

that the money has to go outside the Government. 

There's certainly nothing in this Court's cases that say 

that and the lower courts and this Court at least in 

part have found taxpayer standing to challenge the 

salaries paid to chaplains that are employed by the 

Government, and of course those would be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's -- I 

guess that's my first question. I don't understand 

under your theory why any taxpayer couldn't sue our 

Marshal for standing up and saying "God save the United 

States and this honorable Court." Her salary comes from 

Congress. You can trace that under your traceability 

requirement. So any taxpayer under your theory could

bring that lawsuit.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, I don't -- I don't think 

that lawsuit could be brought, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

let me explain why. We think that the limitations that 

are in this Court's opinions require the taxpayer to 

identify a discrete and identifiable non-incidental 

expenditure. In other words, it's not just any --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's very -- I can 

identify it. It's the appropriations that Congress 

extends to this Court that pay the salary of the 

Marshal.

 MR. PINCUS: But, Your Honor, those 

appropriations don't do the trick, and maybe I can just 

explain our test and explain why. The Court in Doremus 

explained why there was standing in Everson to challenge 

the payments for bus transportation by saying Everson 

showed a measurable appropriation or disbursement of 

school district funds occasioned solely by the 

activities complained of.

 In other words, there has to be some -- the 

violation caused some unique expenditure. Not that the 

moneys wouldn't have been expended, because in this 

context the taxpayer doesn't have to show a lower tax 

burden, but --

MR. PINCUS: -- that there was a tie between 

-- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- there have been Federal 

spending programs declared unconstitutional under the 

establishment clause, and can you cite any instance in 

which such a holding ing has caused a reduction in tax 

rates?

 MR. PINCUS: No, and this Court has said and 

the lower courts have said that that is not the 

requirement, because the injury here that the taxpayer 

complains of, as the Court said in Daimler Chrysler, is 

not an increased tax burden. The injury is the 

expenditure of funds in a way that violates the 

establishment clause.

 JUSTICE ALITO: See, your traceability 

either covers every case or it covers no case. In real 

world taxation terms, no case would ever meet the test. 

But in, in purely conceptual terms, is any Federal money 

being spent, every case involving any expenditure of 

money, even the portion of the Marshal's salary that is 

devoted to convening the Court in the morning, would be 

sufficient.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, respectfully, Your Honor,

Everson. It didn't say the mere fact that Some money

being spent was enough. It said that there was a 

measurable appropriation or disbursement occasioned 

solely by the activities complained of.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me give you something 

more measurable. It is easy to tell from time sheets 

and other things how much money is expended on Air Force 

One and on security for the President when he goes to 

address a religious organization, okay. And he urges 

the importance of religion in American life and so 

forth. The whole trip is about religion. That's 

measurable. Would a taxpayer have standing to --

MR. PINCUS: I don't think so, because, as 

the court of appeals said, that this Court has 

identified a second limitation, which is not incidental. 

The money has to be central -- the money that's being 

challenged has to be central to the violation. Just as 

you couldn't challenge a prayer breakfast --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't understand. 

The money -- say it again?

the violation.

The money wasn't central to the violation there.

certain restrictions that were challenged as being 

religiously based.

challenge to the specific grants. But there were 

specific grants identified and there was an as-applied 

challenge. But the argument was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But this is a specific 

grant. There is money allocated to the White House 

which goes -- you can identify it in the budget, and 

some of it goes to Air Force One. Some of it goes to 

the payment of the security guards.

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor, but the money 

that's identified in the budget is not -- well, it's not 

the entire Air Force one appropriation that would be

JUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't in Bowen either.

 MR. PINCUS: But it was a specific -- there 

was a specific action that allocated a specific amount 

of money to those grantees. And the argument was those 

grantees weren't entitled to any of that money because 

the way they were using it violated the establishment 

clause. And so there was -- the government's own action 

by designating a specific sum of money in that grant 

identified a specific sum of money, and the challenge 

was to that entire expenditure as identified by the 

Government.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I really don't think --

there's an identified sum of money that goes to pay the 

costs of Air Force One, too, to buy the gas and 

everything else. There's an identified sum of money 

that goes into the pockets of the security guards who 

protect the President. I mean, it really doesn't make 

any sense.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I think, I 

think, as I say, there are two tests. One is whether 

there's an identifiable sum. We were talking about with 

respect to grants are the easiest case. There's another 

case as when there's a challenge to an entire program 

that the Government has identified as a particular 

program. And then the question, the second question

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Take 

Justice Breyer's Pilgrim church. Under your theory, if 

the grant was to erect a memorial and suitable museums 

or whatever at Plymouth, Plymouth Rock, then there 

wouldn't be an identifiable sum if the Government said, 

hey, let's use some of this money to build a church?

 MR. PINCUS: If the Government then singled 

out some of that money --

singles it out. By that you mean the executive who's 

implementing it, as opposed to Congress?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes. I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do they -- in 

other words, if they spend the money are they singling 

it out? If it turns out it costs a million dollars to 

build the little Pilgrim church is that an identifiable 

sum singled out that would satisfy your requirement?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, I don't think the 

singling out -- I don't think whether it's discrete and 

identifiable depends on the amount, Your Honor. I think 

it depends on how --whether there is a way -- and this 

really is part of both traceability and redressability.

the taxpayer is seeking to enjoin. And if there is some 

separate Government grant for the building of a church, 

yes, if it's -- if -- if there is some religious --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it doesn't 

have to be a grant, just that you can say it costs so 

much money.

 MR. PINCUS: Or a contract.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MR. PINCUS: If the Government let the 

contract for the building of the church, yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or the contract hiring the 

security guards who protect the President, right? 

They're employed. That's an employment contract.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, they are, and that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And they're protecting him 

for a religious purpose. He's going to this --

MR. PINCUS: Well, they're protecting him 

for a protection purpose. His trip is for a religious 

purpose. And I think our submission is that there is a 

distinction that can be drawn there.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is money that is 

expended in order to enable the President to do 

something for a religious purpose. It wouldn't be 

expended but for the fact that he chose to make this

religious trip.

 MR. PINCUS: But -- but, as with buying the 

bagels at a prayer breakfast, the cost of the bagels, 

like the cost of the security, is not -- is not paying 

for the center of what the violation is. And therefore 

we think that that's the basis for a rule that rules 

those types of expenditures out.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't, it wasn't the 

center in Bowen either. The center in Bowen was 

programs for -- to combat pregnancy. And some of the 

organizations that were getting the money were placing 

conditions on it. It wasn't central to the program. It 

was something added that the challenger said shouldn't 

have been added.

 MR. PINCUS: But their claim was that the 

spending of this entire grant is unconstitutional 

because of the way the money is going to be used by the 

grantees. It wasn't that $1.98 of the is 

unconstitutional and the other million dollars is okay. 

It was that because of the way the grantee was using the 

money, the entire grant is unconstitutional. We think 

that's a different case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. It would only came 

within your theory if there was one Secret Service agent 

who was assigned to religious trips of the President?

Then his entire salary could be challenged. But if it's 

just some of the salary of a Secret Service agent who 

protects the President for all sorts of trips, that 

can't be challenged?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, and we think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that makes a lot of 

sense?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, it does make sense 

because, unlike the Government's limitations, which have 

nothing to do with the rationale of Flast or the 

underlying threepence here of James Madison, that 

does -- that is a particular amount of money that the 

Government is spending and it's identifiable just 

because of religion. We think that that's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we rule in 

your favor, then every Government agency has to make 

sure that whatever activities they undertake are part of 

a broader office? They don't set up a separate White 

House office. They just run it out of the White House 

office.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, they may --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's purely -- a 

purely formalistic distinction.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, I don't think so, Your 

Honor, because I think it preserves --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that would 

decide whether it's central or not. If you have a White 

House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, 

then you can say it's central to it. If it's just the 

White House office, then the argument would be, no, 

that's not central. They do a lot of other stuff as 

went.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, but if there are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the Marshall in 

both --

MR. PINCUS: -- if there are particular 

people in that office for a particular, separately 

called out program in that office that is focused on 

faith-based initiatives only, yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're trying to 

decide whether it is central. You have to decide what 

unit you're looking at before deciding whether the 

activity is central. And you're just saying well, just 

look at the people who are doing the offensive activity, 

and it's obviously going to be central to what they're 

doing.

 MR. PINCUS: Your Honor, I think I haven't 

been clear in the test that I'm suggesting.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Pincus, I would like 

you to go back to an answer you gave because it sounds

to me like it wasn't right. The President needs 

protection at all times no matter where he goes. The 

President may be doing something that violates the 

establishment clause, but protection is the job, and it 

doesn't make any difference where the President is. And 

so your answer to the question, well, suppose he had a 

special protector who just took care of his religious 

activities? I would still say that it's, protection is 

the thing. So I don't think -- I think you didn't --

the answer you gave isn't consistent with your theory of 

this case.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, I think that's right, and 

I think that's because there are two steps to our 

analysis, Justice Ginsburg. One is, is there a discrete 

and identifiable expenditure that only arises with 

respect to religious activities.

 The second question is, does that particular 

expenditure, is that particular expenditure an 

incidental one? Flast said incidental expenditures 

don't give rise to standing. And I think you're right 

in that situation, that expenditure --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But in response to 

Justice Ginsburg's point, you could have said the same 

thing about the expenditure in Bowen. That money would 

have been spent anyway.

MR. PINCUS: But the question --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It happened to have been 

spent badly, but it would have been spent anyway.

 MR. PINCUS: But it would have been spent 

differently, Your Honor, and I think that's the critical 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That was her point, that it 

would have been spent differently. If the President 

hadn't gone to this religious event, he would have gone 

somewhere else and the money would have been spent 

differently. But that didn't make the difference in 

Bowen. Why should it make the difference here?

 MR. BOWEN: Well, I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The fact is it was spent 

for a bad purpose, and that's the essential grievance of 

the plaintiff, it seems to me.

 MR. PINCUS: We agree completely. But we 

also agree that there are some limits that -- the Court 

has said that every single dollar that's expended for a 

bad purpose doesn't give rise to a challenge. My 

example, if there's a prayer breakfast and all -- the 

only money that's spent is on the bagels, we don't 

believe the bagels are the basis for a taxpayer 

challenge to the prayer breakfast.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So in fact, you have --

just help me with one point here.

 I mean, I see that deciding what's 

incidental and what isn't incidental will be difficult. 

I guess many of these cases would end up being decided 

on the merits, there is no violation on the merits, or 

maybe sometimes there is.

 But I'd started thinking of the question of 

standing by thinking that there are strong feelings when 

the Government spends money in favor of one religion and 

not another. After all, they led to the 30 Years War. 

We see that in other places in the world today. People 

feel strongly. And if, in fact, they have that terribly 

strong feeling and can't make any challenge because the 

feelings are shared by many, then there are no cases in 

the courts at all, and the Government can do what it 

wants without challenge.

 So in Flast, they carved out an exception, 

and the exception was where the taxing and spending 

clauses were involved, because Madison and others said 

this is aimed at "Government shall not tax and spend". 

So that was my theory. And all we're saying is where 

there's a big taxing and spending and it isn't 

incidental, there's standing.

 Now we're worried about the merits. Simple 

and clear. To which the response was, which has me a

little worried frankly, was that, well, that was Justice 

Stewart's position, or roughly speaking. But the Court 

rejected that quite clearly, and if you look at later 

cases, they reject it too. And therefore, whatever you 

might think of it, it isn't the law. And I'm not free 

to think whatever, I have to think exactly in accordance 

with what the cases say. So what is your response? I'd 

like you to focus on that.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, respectfully, I think 

that's exactly what Justice Stewart said. Justice 

Stewart in his concurrence did not espouse a broader 

theory than the one that the Court adopted in Flast. 

And he said he joined the judgment, the opinion of the 

Court, and he said, I understand that to hold only that 

a Federal taxpayer has standing to assert that a 

specific expenditure of federal funds violates the 

establishment clause of the First Amendment.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying that what 

Justice Stewart's view, insofar as it was rejected, that 

Flast suggested even broader standing, but it suggested 

at least what Justice Stewart said?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes. I think it's --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right or not?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If Justice Stewart

agreed completely with what the Court said, why did he 

write a separate opinion?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, in the -- sometimes 

despite the Court's desire sometimes to have a less 

separate opinion, sometimes justices do. And what he 

said here is he was just explaining his reason why he 

believed that Flast was distinguishable from 

Frothingham, and notes specifically that taxpayers have 

a clear stake because of the threepence comment.

 Justice Fortas did say, did have a broader 

theory, although he -- in addition, that the court did 

not adopt -- but he also said, recognizing very similar 

language to Justice Stewart, what the Court's opinion 

held. So I think Justice Stewart's opinion is useful 

because he doesn't talk about Congress, he talks about 

expenditures.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me unduly 

intrusive for the courts to tell the President that it 

cannot talk to specific groups to see if they have 

certain talents that the Government may use to make sure 

that all of their energies are used properly by the 

Federal Government.

 It's almost like a speech rationale.

 And perhaps you would say that's just a 

judgment on the merits, but it seems to me that there's

a standing concern here, too, that we would be 

supervising the White House and what it can say, what 

it can -- who it can talk to. And it seems to me that's 

quite intrusive from the standpoint of standing 

purposes.

 I'm not sure that this makes a standard 

that distinguishes the case from Flast or brings it 

within those -- within those cases.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, we believe 

that the incidental test, and what I've been talking 

about in terms of what the limits are, that it has to be 

a non-incidental expenditure protects against that. 

Because if the argument is that some Government 

official, for part of his day met with three ministers, 

and therefore we want to challenge because Government 

shouldn't be meeting with ministers, I think it's both 

for the reason, both because of the fact this is not an 

argument that the expenditure on the hours of the day it 

took to have those meetings is clearly not central to 

anything.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You really want to condemn 

the Federal courts to deciding case by case at the 

instance of all these people who feel passionately about 

this, case by case whether the expenditure was 

incidental or not. It doesn't seem to me an intelligent

expenditure of any sensible person's time.

 MR. PINCUS: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And just to add to 

the question, before you answer, at the jurisdictional 

stage. In other words, this would be litigation over 

whether the individual taxpayer has standing. The Court 

would first have to determine whether the activity 

you're challenging is incidental or not.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I think the 

fact that there hasn't been a lot of these challenges 

that the Government has been able to point to, indicates 

that this may not be a big problem.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe they're 

reading Flast different than you read it. There are not 

a lot of these challenges because you don't have 

standing under Flast.

 MR. PINCUS: But the Court also said in 

Allen against Wright, you know, the absence of precise 

standards does not leave the courts at sea in applying 

the law of standing. Standing isn't an area, really, 

that is susceptible to precise definitions. It seems to 

me that both because of the incidental test and the 

concerns that Justice Kennedy articulated, if someone's 

claim is that people in the White House have five meets 

in the course of a year that they're upset about, it

JUSTICE SCALIA: We'll litigate it. We'll 

figure out a number eventually, I'm sure.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, you know, in Allen 

against Wright, and Linda R.F., there are a whole series 

of cases where this Court has set up guidance, and the 

lower courts have evaluated whether the connection 

between the challenged conduct and the claimed injury --

here the expenditure -- is close enough for there to be 

standing. And this -- the inquiry that we're suggesting 

really isn't that different.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What would happen if when 

this program was set up, nothing said about faith 

whatsoever? This was just going to be a general program

of outreach to community service organizations, but 

plaintiffs claimed that as the program was being 

administered it was heavily favoring religious 

organizations. Would that come out the same way in your 

judgment?

 MR. PINCUS: If their challenge was that the 

entire -- the whole program essentially, as the court of 

appeals characterized the complaint here, the whole 

program essentially is facially neutral, but in reality 

is a preference, yes. Then it would come out the same 

way and the question would be --

JUSTICE ALITO: It depends totally on how 

they characterize?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, that's true in many 

standing questions. The question is, how do you 

characterize the claim?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the problem here is the 

claim, the gravamen here is the Government is doing 

stuff with money that's been taxed from me that it 

shouldn't do. I fail to see how it makes any difference 

to the people who care so passionately about this, as 

Justice Breyer suggests, whether it's just an incidental 

expenditure or whether it's part of a targeted program.

 We don't do that in any other area of 

constitutional law. If someone has been subjected to an

unreasonable search and seizure, we don't say well, you 

know, it was just incidental. Yeah, we know you feel 

badly about it, but this was just an incidental search 

and seizure, and you don't have standing.

 It doesn't make any sense, given the 

gravamen that you're directing this law against, to 

establish such a standard.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, it is a 

standard that the Court established in Flast. It is --

we're not here to try to make sense.

 MR. PINCUS: No. I actually think the 

Court's precedents line up pretty neatly. I think --

claiming that it would violate the establishment clause 

for the President to go to lots and lots of prayer 

breakfasts?

 MR. PINCUS: No.

did, but I guess there is a legitimate concern, somebody 

might think that, I guess. And I guess that if

a way to keep them out.

 MR. PINCUS: You want a way to keep them 

out --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's Justice Kennedy's 

concern.

 MR. PINCUS: Exactly. And --

JUSTICE BREYER: But what they're worried 

about is will this word "incidental" and -- be 

sufficient to keep out the people who might somehow 

decide they want to claim, which sounds like a frivolous 

claim, that the President can't go to a prayer 

breakfast. Now does the word "incidental" do that? 

That's what I think --

MR. PINCUS: Well, our submission is that it 

does, Your Honor, because we think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Again -- I asked 

this before, and I think you were cut off before you had 

a chance. Incidental with respect to what? All of the 

money for a particular meeting, a particular breakfast, 

a particular whatever, is it incidental to that, or is 

it incidental to however many times the President has 

breakfast if he goes to a prayer breakfast?

 MR. PINCUS: It's incidental to what --

what's the focus of the claim? The focus of the claim 

isn't that bagels were served. The focus of the claim

is there was prayer and that it was a religious meeting. 

If there was -- just to think of what such a claim might 

be. And so the expenditure that -- that's been 

identified is the bagels, it really is pretty tangential 

compared to the focus of what someone's complaining 

about. And so we think that's a rational test for doing 

what Justice Kennedy was talking about.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So even if the 

expenditure is very small, but to take a particular 

religious symbol that might be offensive to some other 

people, is that incidental because the meeting went on 

longer and cost more than the particular religious 

symbol?

 MR. PINCUS: No. I think there probably 

there would be two challenges, because there would be a 

challenge to the government's purchase of the religious 

symbol to have at the meeting in addition to the 

meeting, and I think then --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if it was 2 

dollars, you would say it's not incidental because it 

covered the whole cost of purchasing the religious 

symbol?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, but I don't think this --

and I think the Government agrees with this. I don't 

think this is a test about how much. I think this is a

test about the relationship between the expenditure 

that's challenged and the claim, what's alleged to be 

unlawful this complex of Government activity.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So there's no standing to 

challenge a presidential directive which says we are 

going to buy bagels for all evangelistic Christian 

breakfasts.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay? But not for any --

MR. PINCUS: No, I think there would be 

standing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why would there be 

standing?

 MR. PINCUS: Because there the challenge is 

to the discriminatory purchase. It's not about the 

prayer breakfast, it's about the idea that the 

Government is purchasing bagels in a religiously 

discriminatory way.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course. But the 

point is that makes --

MR. PINCUS: So there absolutely would be 

standing.

It's not -- incidental doesn't protect you from 

frivolous or insignificant claims in any way.

because there would have to be an allegation in that 

situation that bagels were being purchased on a 

religious basis, and that's going to be awfully hard for

I may --

bagels are being purchased only for evangelicals and not 

for Jewish breakfasts?

from somebody who's starting a Jewish prayer breakfast

bagels for a Jewish prayer breakfast.

people who feel passionately about this just in general. 

You walk in and say he can't do this because I'm a 

taxpayer, and you say I'm sorry, being a taxpayer is not 

enough, we don't care how passionately you feel about 

it --

MR. PINCUS: I don't think general passion 

is enough. I think what the Court said is there has to 

be a tie-in, and let me say that I think what's critical 

here is any test obviously is susceptible to 

hypotheticals, but the Government -- our test at least 

keeps in taxpayer standing the core of what the framers 

were worried about, which is Government expenditure of 

funds --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Pincus, may I ask you 

this question? Do you think your theory is consistent 

with Valley Forge?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor, we do, because 

in Valley Forge, first of all, as Justice Ginsburg said, 

the Court relied on the fact that it was a property 

clause claim. There is a passage in Valley Forge that 

refers to executive action, but the Court in Kendrick 

when it talked about Valley Forge said, in 

characterizing that case, said executive action pursuant 

to the property clause. And we think those things are 

tied together and there's a reason why. In the

appropriations context, there always is congressional 

action with respect to the very money that's at issue 

because there has to be a congressional appropriation. 

That's not true in the property context. Congress 

doesn't have to say, pass a statute to say, here are the 

58 property sites that we want the executive to get rid 

of.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think the distinction 

between taxing, between taxing and spending and the 

property clause, makes any sense? Do you think James 

Madison would not be upset if the Commonwealth of 

Virginia transferred 10,000 acres to the Anglican 

Church? That would be okay, but the threepence in 

taxation would not?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, I think that the core of 

what was the concern was -- was the taking of the money 

and the using it for religious purposes. And I 

think what the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's not the same 

money used. It's not the same property.

 MR. PINCUS: No, it's not the same money.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It goes into some pot of 

fungible money and it's other money used. So instead of 

using other money, you use land. Does that make a 

difference?

MR. PINCUS: Well, I think that the Court 

decided that it made a difference, and I think in terms 

of cabining, in terms of the worry that perhaps Flast is 

going to be overbroad and the need to have Congress 

involved, which I think is key -- there was no 

congressional involvement at all in designating those 

properties and there is in the appropriations context, 

and I think that's a key difference. But I think what's 

important here, and the Court's colloquy in the first 

part of the argument showed me this -- but the 

Government's position, the idea that it's only grants to 

third parties -- - the Government could hire a corps of 

chaplains and send them out to civilians and to the 

populace at large and that couldn't be challenged, 

because all it is is executive pay; and the Idea that 

there's some difference between a Bowen v. Kendrick 

situation, where the executive had tremendous discretion 

in terms of where it was going to give the money, and 

the situation here, which is the exercise of Precisely 

the same executive discretion, makes no sense.

 The injury is the same. The conduct 

that's -- that's the core of the violation is the same. 

It's an Executive Branch decision to use funds in a way 

that's impermissible under the establishment clause, and 

we've been drawing the lines that the Government has

been trying to draw just makes no sense, and to leave 

out, to insulate from any taxpayer challenge really huge 

swaths of conduct that is really at the very core of 

what Madison was concerned about.

 So our submission is that that really makes 

no sense. There's no basis in history, for example, for 

the Government's claim that Executive Branch decisions 

are somehow different and insulated with respect to 

spending. It's the spending of the same threepence, and 

if history indicates anything it's that concerns about 

establishment were focused just as much on the King as 

on the Parliament in terms of the history that the 

framers understood.

 And for the idea that the executive would be 

given free rein to exercise discretion with respect to 

spending and there would be no concern about the types 

of injuries that gave rise to Flast we think is just not 

right.

 If the Court has no further questions, thank 

you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Pincus.

 General Clement, you have three minutes

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice. Just a few points in rebuttal.

 First of all, I think it's important to 

emphasize that if this Court recognizes that there is 

not taxpayer standing, that does not mean that there 

won't be lawsuits, that there won't be directly injured 

plaintiffs that can bring claims. Doremus and Schemp 

prove that point. But even more broadly, any time the 

establishment clause injury takes the form of alleged 

coercive conduct the individuals who are coerced Are 

going to have standing to bring the suit.

 The second point to make clear is it's just 

not an accurate description of this Court's cases to say 

that the spending of appropriated funds by the executive 

is enough to give rise to taxpayer standing. The 

property distribution plan at issue in Valley Forge took 

a tremendous amount of appropriated funds to run. 

Nobody thought that was a basis for taxpayer standing. 

The Bibles that were purchased and the salaries of the 

teachers in Doremus presumably cost at least a 

threepence. But that was not found enough.

 Now, I think in trying to understand the 

Court's cases you really have to focus on this word 

"incidental." And I think that the colloquy in the

second half of the argument shows that you can't look at 

incidental as being minimal. It doesn't mean that. It 

doesn't mean minimal. It doesn't mean incremental. It 

is trying to distinguish an incidental expenditure of 

funds when -- as to something where the expenditure of 

funds is central or vital to the establishment clause 

violation. In the context of money going to third party 

religious entities, nobody would say that the spending 

is incidental. It's the whole violation. In the 

context of Bible reading or anything else the Executive 

Branch does, the fact that money went to fund the 

Executive Branch to violate the establishment clause is 

the least of the problems. The problem is the primary 

conduct of the Executive Branch in violating the 

establishment clause, but that's not a spending injury. 

The funding that goes into that is incidental. I think 

that's the way to make sense of this Court's cases.

 It's important to emphasize what's at issue 

here. It's not a general challenge to the Faith-Based 

Office. It's not a challenge to the name of the office. 

It is a challenge to the particular offices and the 

assertion that the Executive Branch officials at the 

conferences spent too much time talking about 

faith-based groups and not enough talking about 

community-based groups. If that isn't intrusive on the

Executive Branch, I don't know what is.

 The last point I would leave you with is 

that if something has to go in this area, if you have to 

choose between the logic of Flast and the irreducible 

minimum requirements of Article III, I think it's an 

easy choice. You don't abandon the basic requirements 

of Article III that distinguish the Judiciary from the 

political branches of Government.

 I think the Seventh Circuit, with all due 

respect, lost sight of that. Its decision should be 

reversed. Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, general.

 The case is submitted.
