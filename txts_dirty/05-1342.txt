 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in 05-1342, Watters v. Wachovia Bank.

 Mr. Blanchard.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOHN BLANCHARD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BLANCHARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The dual banking system of State and Federal 

regulation in our nation which we've enjoyed for over 

140 years is one of the finest examples of cooperative 

federalism in our history. For 35 years, the States, 

not the OCC, have prudently exercised their authority 

over non-bank State-chartered operating local 

subsidiaries of national banks. Indeed, respondent 

Wachovia Mortgage complied with Michigan law for 6 years 

until in 2003 there was a corporate reshuffling and now 

it claims it's exempt from the same Michigan laws it 

complied with.

 The OCC through its Regulation 7.40006 has 

disrupted the careful balance and seeks to deprive the 

States of the regulatory authority that they have 

historically exercised.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the national bank set

up its mortgage operations as a division or as a 

department, then the sole regulator would be OCC, right?

 MR. BLANCHARD: That's correct, Your Honor. 

But Wachovia Bank and Wachovia Mortgage made a choice. 

They made a business judgment to create a 

State-chartered operating subsidiary.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did they do 

that? What's the advantage to them having that 

subsidiary rather than doing this directly?

 MR. BLANCHARD: Your Honor, the advantage is 

that Wachovia Bank insulates itself from liability, 

because it's a bedrock principle of state corporate law 

that the parent corporation is not liable for the acts 

of the subsidiary corporation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So mortgage 

subsidiary could possibly get into some trouble that the 

bank wants to protect itself from and not have -- they 

have a certain number of assets that are subject to 

liability in the subsidiary, but they would -- otherwise 

they'd expose the whole bank to those liabilities?

 MR. BLANCHARD: Absolutely, Your Honor. 

From -- the conception behind operating subsidiaries was 

to separate a certain part of the business and the 

attendant risks of that business also to separate.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I assume that the

Federal regulating authorities require a certain ratio 

of loans to real estate value, things of that sort. And 

I assume that the States may have different rules with 

regard to that; right? In other words, the oversight 

might be different. The States may be more permissive 

as to certain loans or as to, you know, what the balance 

sheet of the bank has to look like than the Federal 

Government is. And if you have a State subsidiary that 

is overseen by state authorities, you might have a 

different result.

 MR. BLANCHARD: Possibly, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if not I don't see 

any advantage in this great Federal banking system 

you're talking about, if it's Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

 MR. BLANCHARD: Well, the States do not --

exclusive visitorial powers over national banks rest 

with the OCC. But Wachovia Bank and Wachovia Mortgage 

are separate and distinct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not seeking 

visit -- "visitorial," is that the word?

 MR. BLANCHARD: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not seeking 

visitorial rights with respect to the parent bank.

 MR. BLANCHARD: Absolutely not.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not arguing

that because you need to see more about the mortgage 

subsidiary you need to see what the parent is up to?

 MR. BLANCHARD: No.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

 MR. BLANCHARD: No, we're not. Michigan and 

the States want to be able to help their citizens with 

abusive and predatory lending complaints.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that it was a 

national bank. Forget the subsidiary. And your State 

says: Well, we want to have a law here that says we 

want to send our own bank examiners in. And moreover, 

we don't want them to make any loans in excess of 12 

percent interest. Fine. Would that be constitutional? 

I mean, wouldn't be preempted?

 MR. BLANCHARD: As to the national bank?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, of course, because it 

conflicts and they don't want it.

 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Do they have 

the authority to say a subsidiary is a national bank?

 MR. BLANCHARD: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, they can't? Where is 

it in the law that says they don't have the authority to

say that a subsidiary of a national bank owned by a 

national bank is a national bank? Is there something 

specifically that stops them from saying that?

 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What?

 MR. BLANCHARD: The Gold Foods case, the --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is it? What is it --

I mean, what statute or what is it that prevents them 

from saying it? I don't know the Gold Foods case.

 MR. BLANCHARD: Well, the point is that the 

corporate law recognizes the two as separate and 

distinct corporate entities.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought your point was 

that the statute defines national bank, but also defines 

affiliates, and refers to them as two separate entities.

 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I thought your point 

was that the effect of this regulation is to simply 

eliminate that distinction?

 MR. BLANCHARD: You're right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Their argument, they 

haven't argued -- I realize this was a hypothetical, but 

they haven't argued that the subsidiary should be 

treated as a national bank. They're arguing that 

they're entitled to say that the same preemption that

subsidiaries.

 MR. BLANCHARD: Exactly. That's what they 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Presumably, if they 

said it's treated as a national bank they would lose the 

benefit of the separate corporate existence when it came 

to issues of liability. If they said this subsidiary is 

a national bank, then presumably the separate corporate 

existence they're seeking to take advantage of would be 

obliterated.

 MR. BLANCHARD: Well, but that's the -- they 

are trying to contend that they are one and the same. 

But they can't have their cake and eat it, too.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess we can ask 

the respondents. But is it your understanding that 

respondents take the position that the State has no 

control at all over whether or not the shares have been 

properly issued, whether or not certain accounting 

requirements applicable to all corporations have been 

complied with?

 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes, that is my 

understanding of their position.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They say that there's no 

area of State law that is applicable to the subsidiary

corporation?

 MR. BLANCHARD: They are saying that 

visitorial powers over the State-chartered operating 

subs is exclusively --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I could understand that 

with reference to just the amount of consumer loans, as 

Justice Scalia was talking about. But just to see if 

the corporation has a -- had -- had a meeting that year, 

has duly elected its officers under State law, do the 

respondents take the position you have no authority to 

visit the corporation to determine that?

 MR. BLANCHARD: They take the authority --

the position that Michigan has no authority to impose on 

the State-chartered operating sub the two Michigan 

laws --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But let's -- there are 

two different kinds of regulations. I think 

Justice Kennedy was talking about regulations of a 

chartering State. This subsidiary was set up under the 

law of a State. It wasn't Michigan. Is there -- is 

anyone contesting that --was it North Carolina?

 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes, you're correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that they have to meet 

all the requirements for setting up a corporation and 

having meetings and all that that North Carolina

requires of corporations that are incorporated in that 

State?

 MR. BLANCHARD: No, I've not heard them say 

that as to North Carolina law. But what they're saying 

is that the Michigan Mortgage Broker, Lenders and 

Servicers Licensing Act and the Michigan Secondary 

Mortgage Act do not apply to them.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that seems to be a 

standard preemption case. It's not as broad as just 

visitorial powers generally. Maybe I'm wrong. Do some 

subsidiaries of the -- of a national bank do things 

other than banking, say title insurance or something 

like that? I don't see anything in the record where the 

OCC wants to displace the State as to that. This is 

just a standard preemption case. When the OCC has 

regulations that control, then the State has no 

authority to add to those regulations or to have, or to 

have contrary regulations. But if it's something that 

doesn't have to do with banking at all, then I suppose 

they would say -- I can ask them -- I suppose they say 

the State has authority to regulate.

 MR. BLANCHARD: The important point, though, 

Your Honor, is that the OCC has no independent power to 

preempt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign 

State.

JUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't it have exactly the 

same power that any other agency or Congress has? That 

it has the power, if its regulation is authorized, it 

has the power to what they say, preempt a state law that 

obstructs, impairs, or conditions a bank's ability fully 

to exercise its federally authorized real estate lending 

powers? That's what they say, and then they list some 

examples.

 Suppose they said nothing. Wouldn't we be 

in the same boat? After all, a state cannot under the 

Federal Constitution normally enact a law that 

interferes or stands as an obstacle to the achievement 

of the objective of the Federal law.

 So if that's right, or if it's wrong, 

explain why it's wrong, but if it's right, why don't you 

tell me whether the two laws that you are worried about 

do or do not stand as an obstacle to the full 

achievement of the purposes of the statute as 

implemented by their regulation?

 MR. BLANCHARD: They do not.

 First of all, if the OCC -- if Congress 

intends to alter the balance that I spoke of earlier, it 

must do so with clear and manifest language. There must 

be unmistakably clear language that Congress intended to 

authorize the OCC to preempt the state law.

JUSTICE BREYER: Let's assume I don't agree 

with you about that, that I think conflict preemption 

does not require clear language. Assume that, even 

though you disagree with it. Now on my assumption that 

you can have the law if it doesn't conflict, but you 

can't have the law if it does conflict, so now you 

explain to me why the two laws at issue here don't 

conflict.

 MR. BLANCHARD: Your Honor, in the Barnett 

case and in the Atherton case, in order to have the kind 

of problem you're talking about, there must be a 

significant interference with the business of banking or 

an incapacitation of the business of banking. Our 

Michigan law doesn't incapacitate what --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Blanchard, may I ask 

you a question, perhaps preliminary to what you are 

launching into? My understanding was that you did not 

question the OCC's regulatory authority over a unit that 

it says can do what the national bank itself could do in 

the real estate business, no more, no less. OCC 

regulation, visitation, all the rest, OCC's regulations 

validly applied to this subsidiary that has been set up 

in North Carolina and is operating in Michigan; is that 

right? It is one thing for you to say we have the 

authority to regulate. Are you saying at the same time

that OCC is out of the picture because its dual 

regulation conflicts with the inevitable?

 MR. BLANCHARD: I am not saying that. What 

I am saying is the OCC does not have the exclusive 

right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ah, you're saying, you 

started to say they can't have their cake and eat it 

too, but you're saying they can have the worst of all 

possible regulatory worlds, so that they've got two 

equally competent regulators, and they have to meet the 

requirements of both?

 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes. I am saying that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if they don't 

want to, they don't have to set up a separate 

subsidiary, right? They can do this business directly 

as a national bank and they're not going to be subject 

to any visitation?

 MR. BLANCHARD: You are absolutely correct. 

As I started to say earlier, they made that choice and 

they came to Michigan, and they obtained a certificate 

of authority from the Michigan Corporations Division as 

a foreign for-profit corporation doing business in the 

state.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And I would 

have thought your answer to Justice Breyer was yes, that

they get to regulate to the extent they want to, and the 

state does, and if there's a conflict, the federal 

regulation will prevail, but what's the problem here is 

that they're issuing a categorical regulation saying the 

state can't regulate at all.

 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes. They are claiming 

exclusive preemptive authority.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I didn't understand that 

you made this --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just finish, please? 

You argued, as I understand it, correctly, that the 

state does, exercises certain regulatory controls that 

will not be exercised -- will not be replaced by federal 

controls; is that right? In other words, you -- that 

they will be unregulated to a certain extent? There 

will be less regulation under the federal sovereign than 

there is under the state; is that correct?

 MR. BLANCHARD: You are correct, Your Honor, 

in that Wachovia Mortgage as a subsidiary of a national 

bank is a registrant under Michigan law. And as a 

registrant, it is not subject to an annual --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Can you give me some 

specific examples of what Michigan would require that 

the OCC does not require? You mentioned licensing, for 

example.

MR. BLANCHARD: Michigan would require 

Wachovia Mortgage to register. There's a difference 

between registration and licensure. As a subsidiary of 

Wachovia Bank, they are a registrant like they've been 

for the last --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that have any impact 

on the way they run their business?

 MR. BLANCHARD: No.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, does it make any 

difference as a matter of what they have to do in order 

to comply with the law that they are now exempt from 

Michigan rules and subject to Federal rules instead?

 MR. BLANCHARD: No. Michigan just wants to 

be able to -- and the other states -- to deal with fraud 

and deceit and material misrepresentation in mortgage 

transactions, and to have a say over the corporations 

that come to their state and do business.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Blanchard, if I could 

go back to what you were saying before this last line of 

questioning, I didn't understand your position to be 

that the OCC can come in and regulate this non-Federal 

bank up to the point where its -- well, can do it 

apparently without limitation. And where its regulation 

conflicts with the state regulation, the Federal 

prevails.

state says no, you can have outstanding loans of 

8 billion.

 MR. BLANCHARD: No, Your Honor, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. What happens in that 

situation?

 MR. BLANCHARD: Well, it doesn't happen in 

Michigan because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, invent some other 

hypothetical then. I'm talking about a situation in 

which the Federal law is more permissive than the state 

law. Which law prevails? The Federal law allows this 

bank to do things which the state law would not allow it 

to do. As I understood your prior answer, you say oh, 

of course, if the Federal law allows to it do things the 

state law doesn't allow to it do, the Federal law 

prevails. I didn't understand that to be your position. 

And if it is your position, I don't know what all this 

fuss is about. That's the end of the game, isn't it?

in -- we do not conduct -- they are exempt from an 

examination where we go in and look yearly at such 

things as capital assets management, earnings, 

liquidity. Those aren't the kinds of things that we're 

talking about. They, as a registrant, they are exempt 

from that, from an annual examination. They're not 

incapacitated, nor are --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Exempt from state 

examination?

 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes. The state chartered 

corporation, Wachovia Mortgage, is exempt under Michigan 

law from an annual examination.

 JUSTICE BREYER: We're not looking for that. 

We're looking for the opposite. As I read this, the 

banking agency has not said, we wipe out all of your 

laws. They've said, we wipe out a subset of laws, which 

are defined as those laws that obstruct, impair, or 

limit the ability of this bank to fulfill its federally 

mandated powers. Okay? So they're just saying, we only 

get the ones that are in conflict. Now, they then have 

a list of which ones they preempt and which ones they 

don't. So my question to you is, give me a list here of 

which ones they think conflict that you think don't.

their entirety, are preempted.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Their position is 

not that it only preempts in cases of conflict. Under 

12c apart, 7.4006, it says, state laws apply to national 

bank operated subsidiaries, which is what we're dealing 

with here, to the same extent that those laws apply to 

the parent national bank, which is to say not at all.

 MR. BLANCHARD: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's not a case 

of conflict preemption. They're trying to preempt state 

law whether it conflicts or not, right?

 MR. BLANCHARD: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You do have -- one thing 

that seems concrete and clear to me -- correct me if I 

get this wrong -- Michigan is kind of deferring to OCC 

in its primary jurisdiction sense. It says customers, 

if you've got complaints about what this operating

if we think -- we, Michigan -- thinks OCC has not given 

you an adequate response to your complaint, we take 

over.

That's the Michigan regulatory --

last word, but here you're saying Michigan has decided 

that it will let OCC go first and Michigan will be kind 

of a supervisor for the adequacy of the OCC's handling 

of the consumer's complaint?

 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes, you are exactly 

correct. Our regulatory framework in Michigan says that 

the complaint is referred to the appropriate Federal 

agency, and only if that complaint is not being 

adequately pursued does the commissioner have that 

window of investigative authority for her to pursue it. 

It is a cooperative type of statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know another 

arrangement where the Federal agency goes first but then 

the state agency has authority to say Federal agency, 

you didn't deal with this consumer adequately, so we 

will take over? I know schemes that work the other way 

where the state goes first, and then the Federal 

authority, but do you know another one?

 MR. BLANCHARD: Another one that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where the primary 

adjudicator, decision-maker would be the Federal 

authority, but then the state can override that if it 

thinks the Federal authority hasn't done an adequate 

job?

investigate if the complaint referred to the comptroller 

has not been adequately --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not the question. 

Justice Ginsburg is trying to find out if you know any 

other situation where when the Federal agency doesn't do 

an adequate job, the state agency comes in?

 MR. BLANCHARD: No situations come directly 

to mind.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe civil rights actions 

where there's a Federal agency that has some remedial 

powers and if the Federal agency doesn't act, the 

citizen is free to bring litigation in state court? I 

guess that would be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or environmental 

regulation where just because the Federal EPA doesn't 

take a particular action against a polluter, doesn't 

mean that the state can't take action against the 

polluter.

 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't the action an 

inadequate action? Michigan is saying yeah, the Federal 

authority can do with respect to this unit just what it 

would do to a national bank itself, but if we think that 

is inadequate, that is a question of just one act or the

 MR. BLANCHARD: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if the Federal 

U.S. Attorney prosecutes, decides to prosecute someone 

for manslaughter, the state can decide that's not an 

adequate enough response and prosecute them for murder, 

right?

wanted to, could it just tell the feds to butt out and

come in first, and we only step in when we think you 

haven't done a good job, but we've had it.

banks?

JUSTICE SCALIA: I know in Michigan. I'm 

saying, could Michigan change its statutory scheme to 

kick the Feds out? Or would that be prevented by this 

Federal statute we're discussing here? I'm trying to 

see what you think this Federal statute does. Or what 

the --

MR. BLANCHARD: The Federal rule provides 

that the operating -- the State chartered operating subs 

are to be treated just like the law pertaining to the 

parent national bank. And there is no authority from 

Congress given to the OCC that kind of rule. The OCC 

only has the authority that Congress gives it, either 

through a preemptive statute or through the dell 

designation of preemptive authority; and Congress has 

not given them that kind of power.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask the question --

the regulatory question. You do not dispute Michigan 

does not dispute that the operating -- well, strike 

that.

 Michigan does not dispute that national 

banks can go into business of real estate loans?

 And Michigan does not dispute that Congress 

has authorized national banks to operate through 

subsidiaries for specific purposes like this.

 My question is can you give me any plausible

reason to think that Congress would have contemplated 

this system of potentially more restrictive State 

legislation when its national bank in a given instance 

decides to do -- to exercise its Federal banking power 

through a subsidiary rather than directly?

 Can you think of any reason that Congress 

would have contemplated the scheme that you're, that 

you're defending?

 MR. BLANCHARD: Well, first of all, Your 

Honor, I'm not defending that Michigan has a more 

restrictive scheme or that Michigan law in any way 

incapacitates or significantly interferes with the 

business of banking.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if, if -- if the 

banks have got, let's say, a subsidiary has to go 

through two rounds of bank inspection every year instead 

of one round, it is going to cost them something. 

Regulation costs the regulated entity something. It is 

a burden on them.

 And we also have to assume that there may be 

instances -- you brought it up -- in, in which the, the 

-- the State burden is heavier. So with those 

possibilities in mind, can you think of any reason why 

Congress in authorizing the exercise of the Federal 

banking power through a subsidiary would have

contemplated Michigan or any State would have this 

authority?

 It seems counterintuitive to me. They're 

saying you can -- - you can -- you banks can exercise 

the Federal banking power through a subsidiary. It 

would seem strange to me that Congress would silently 

say, "and, of course, we acquiesce to a -- a dual system 

of regulation that would not apply to the bank itself."

 What reason would Congress have had for 

assuming that might be the result?

 MR. BLANCHARD: A recognition that the 

States have a sovereign, compelling and legitimate 

interest in regulating those corporations that it 

charters and that do business within its borders. And 

-- and that that balance should be respected.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So it is state sovereign 

immunity in effect, is the answer -- State sovereignty 

is rather the answer?

 MR. BLANCHARD: But the - but the key point, 

and I would like to reserve whatever time I may have.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You better hurry 

then.

 MR. BLANCHARD: The key, the key point is 

that Congress has distinguished clearly and 

unequivocally between affiliates and national banks; but

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. LONG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court.

 I would like to start with the question that 

Justice Souter asked because there are some important 

principles that are really not disputed in this case, 

and I think they help to focus the issue that is before 

the Court.

 There is no dispute, as we understand it, 

that mortgage lending by national banks is supervised 

exclusively by the Comptroller of the Currency. And 

there is also no dispute that national banks' incidental 

powers under Section 247 include the power to make 

mortgage loans through a operating subsidiary. And an 

additional point is that both Federal statutes and 

Federal regulations state that when national banks make 

mortgage loans or exercise their banking powers through

subsidiaries they do so subject to the same terms and

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Blanchard, may I ask 

you a question. I just want to understand. Wachovia 

has branch banks all over the country. Are they 

generally subsidiaries or are they divisions of the 

bank?

 MR. LONG: Well, a branch of a national bank 

has a particular status under Section 36 of the National 

Bank Act.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that. I'm 

asking a factual question.

 MR. LONG: It would not be separately 

incorporated. So --

JUSTICE STEVENS: They are actually 

divisions, in effect, of the national bank itself?

 MR. LONG: Well, I think they are generally 

referred to as branches but I think its would be more a 

division. That would be --

JUSTICE STEVENS: At least they are not 

separate corporate subsidiaries.

 MR. LONG: That -- that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Why is that, that the Best 

bank decided to use the subsidiary approach for this

business, rather than the more traditional banking 

approach.

 MR. LONG: Well, of course, anything that a 

bank does through an operating subsidiary it could do 

through the bank. It can always do it through the bank. 

But there are many reasons why a bank may choose an 

operating subsidiary. They can be managerial reasons; 

it's -- just sometimes works better as matter of 

business management.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It protects from 

liability, too.

 MR. LONG: Well, that is one of the reasons. 

Although --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- in the district.

 MR. LONG: I will say, Justice Stevens, I 

have not been able to find examples of national bank 

operating subsidiaries that have become insolvent. They 

are regulated very heavily by the Comptroller and so 

they don't.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you have a 

subsidiary that's in the mortgage lending business that 

presumably competes with other companies in the mortgage 

lending business that are not associated with national 

banks, and you're claiming an immunity from the 

regulation that their competitors are subject to. Is

 MR. LONG: Well, but again, Mr. Chief 

Justice, the national banks compete. And its undisputed 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's fine, and 

they have an express provision in 48 -- 484(a) that says 

they're, they're exempt from regulation. The question 

is whether a separate subsidiary that is not a national 

bank that competes with other mortgage lending companies 

is immune from the regulation that those other 

companies --

MR. LONG: But again, Mr. Chief Justice, 

thrifts, S&Ls, State-Chartered banks in all 50 States 

are permitted to have operating subsidiaries. It's 

recognized not just for national banks, but really for 

all types of banking institutions, that are operating 

subsidiaries are a useful tool of banking. This is not 

a sort of special privilege that's given --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Breyer's 

questions were pointing out, to the extent your 

regulation -- the Federal regulation of your subsidiary 

conflicts with the State law, that regulation is going 

to prevail. The question is whether or not you are 

immune from State regulation across the board --

question. I mean, I think it might be useful to think 

first about national banks and then about the operating 

subsidiaries. It is not true that there are no State 

laws that apply to national banks.

 This Court's unanimous Barnett Bank decision 

is the clearest statement of the principle. Any State 

laws that prevent or significantly impair or impede the 

exercise of national banking powers are preempted. But 

many State laws having to do with contracts --

JUSTICE ALITO: In real world terms, what's 

involved here? What are examples of some of the things 

that Michigan does or some other State does that impair 

or impede the operations to the --

MR. LONG: The beginning is, it is a 

complete separate set of regulation. You have to 

register or obtain a license. You have to submit to 

examination by the regulator. Investigation. 

Enforcement. There are substantive laws; Michigan has 

some that are not directly at issue in this case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of those laws 

might be, I mean, let's say they have a law, when you're 

issuing a mortgage to a consumer, you have to give them 

a disclosure about how much they're going to end up 

paying over the life of the loan and all that. And they 

require that of anybody who issues a mortgage in

Michigan. Could that law be applied to your subsidiary?

 MR. LONG: Well, the question, Mr. Chief 

Justice, would be is it preempted as to the national 

bank? The Comptroller of the Currency would say yes. 

But the issue in this case is if it is preempted as to 

the national bank, then it is also preempted when the 

national bank chooses to exercise this power that it has 

under Section 24 --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't -- isn't your 

friend correct then? You are really trying to have your 

cake and eat it, too. You're saying if we did this 

without a subsidiary, we wouldn't be subject to that. 

But you want to be able to operate through a subsidiary 

and yet not be subject to the same rules that apply to 

other people.

 MR. LONG: Well, but it, it with respect, it 

is not really a case of having our cake and eating it, 

too. We are in the area of powers of national banks. 

And the Court has recognized for a century that in that 

area, when national banks have powers, including 

incidental powers recognized by the Comptroller, they 

generally preempt any State law that prevents or 

significantly interferes --

because I thought first, when I read the reg, 34.4.ab, 

that those things that are preempted are those things 

that obstruct, impair or condition, or in other words 

limit, the Federal powers of a national bank.

 MR. LONG: That, that is correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But I thought we were 

basically dealing with conflict --

MR. LONG: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- not fielding.

 MR. LONG: It's -- that's one level --

JUSTICE BREYER: But -- but the last part of 

the reg says that what applies, no State law applies to 

a national bank operating subsidiary if it doesn't apply 

to the parent bank. And I began to think it fields 

preemption. Am I right in thinking that it is conflict 

preemption, not field, because it is conflict in the 

case of a national bank?

 MR. LONG: Well -- it's, it's a very 

important point. And our position is there are actually 

several ways in which you could analyze this case and 

arrive at the conclusion that the Comptroller's 

regulations are valid. One is looking simply at 

statutory language and saying we would, we the Court 

would reach this result as we did in the Franklin 

National Bank case even without any regulation. And

second of all is to say the regulations are a reasonable 

interpretation of the statute. A third is to say that 

the Comptroller has broad rulemaking authority. And as 

this Court recognized in De La Cuesta and many other 

cases, an agency exercising its rulemaking authority can 

preempt State laws even though the statute itself would 

not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think, the question is 

not whether it can preempt State laws but whether the 

rulemaking authority can, can eliminate a, a basic 

division of the statute into a national bank and 

affiliates of the national bank. The statute makes a 

clear distinction between the two. And the effect of 

what, of what the agency has to done here is simply to 

eliminate that distinction, and to say really it doesn't 

matter.

 MR. LONG: No. It -- I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If you are an affiliate of 

a national bank, you have the same immunity that the 

national bank has. That's not what the statute says.

 MR. LONG: I have a two-part answer to that 

question, Justice Scalia. One is that Section 484 of 

the section you're referring to does limit the 

visitorial authority as to national banks, but it is 

silent as to operating subsidiaries or any other type of

affiliate. States do exercise visitorial authority over 

some affiliates of national banks. That's established. 

Operating subsidiaries are a special type of affiliate; 

484, which was enacted during the Civil War, a hundred 

years before operating subsidiaries were authorized, 

really doesn't address the question of visitorial 

authority.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, an operating 

subsidiary is an affiliate, right? What kind of 

affiliates did they have before they had operating 

subsidiaries? Did they rent pool halls, or what?

 MR. LONG: It's a type of affiliate --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought that 

any affiliate of a national bank would, would be engaged 

in essentially banking business.

 MR. LONG: But, but this really became 

clear, in answer to your question, in part two of my 

answer. In 1999 when Congress enacted the 

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, it directly addressed this 

question of affiliates of national banks. And this is 

on page 2A of our appendix. It refers to, it created a 

new type of affiliate, for the first time, financial 

subsidiaries which can do anything financial in nature. 

So they can actually engage in activities that the 

parent national bank could not.

But if you look at the bottom of page 2A of 

our appendix, this is Section 24A now of the act, it 

said that financial subsidiaries can also engage in 

activities that are permitted for national banks to 

engage in directly, subject to the same terms and 

conditions that govern the conduct of the activities by 

a national bank.

 And then at the bottom of 3A and going over 

to 4A where they actually define financial subsidiaries, 

they do so by distinguishing them from the operating 

subsidiaries which had existed for decades. And at the 

top of 4A you see that the operating subsidiary again 

engages only in activities that the national banks may 

engage in directly and are conducted subject to the same 

terms and conditions.

 Then if you'll bear with me a moment longer, 

on page 12A of our appendix some additional provisions 

of GLBA -- actually, that's the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 

GLBA people call it -- said -- this is on 12A -- that 

securities activities and insurance activities, 

activities that have been traditionally subject to State 

regulation, if they're engaged in by a functionally 

regulated subsidiary, operating subsidiary or a 

financial subsidiary, then they may be regulated by 

relevant State securities authorities or State insurance

authorities.

 So Congress was actually quite specific. 

I mean, your question is about statutory language.  You 

don't find this in 484, which is, since it's a century 

old, doesn't really get into this. But in this 1999 

statute, it's all about subsidiaries of national banks. 

Congress was pretty clear if it's securities, if it's 

insurance, it can be regulated by States. They were 

specific about that. If it's a banking activity that 

the bank itself can undertake, it's subject to the same 

terms and conditions.

 And so, going back to the Chief 

Justice's question, you have this question of would it 

be a preempted State preempted state law if it were 

applied to the national bank when the national bank is 

making a mortgage loan. Not every State law is 

preempted because not every State law conflicts. But if 

it does --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What authority 

do you have for the proposition that when then Federal 

law says subject to the same terms and conditions that 

they're referring To State regulation as opposed to the 

same Federal regulation that applies to the national 

banks?

7.4006, which is the 0CC's regulation interpreting that 

language in the statute and in its own OPSUB 

regulations, section 5.34. And we also relied simply on 

the ordinary meaning of "terms and conditions." It 

means prerequisites, limitations.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was 7.4006 issued 

pursuant to -- what did you call it, GLBA?

 MR. LONG: GLBA?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. Or did it 

predate that?

 MR. LONG: 7.4006 was issued pursuant to 

24-7, which is this incidental powers provision, and 

24(a), which I've just been walking you through, which 

is a provision of GLBA. So it is based partly upon 

GLBA, and it is an interpretation of the same terms and 

conditions language.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Conflict preemption 

basically strikes down a State law that stands as an 

obstacle to the full enforcement of the Federal law.

 MR. LONG: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, with that 

in mind, suppose that you didn't have either 7.4006 or 

34.4(a)(B). Neither existed. But we listened to what 

the agency said as a Court and they explained how the 

regulation worked. Would you expect to come to

precisely the same result?

 MR. LONG: Well, I mean, of course --

JUSTICE BREYER: Would you or not?

 MR. LONG: We do have them and we think that 

makes the case easier, of course.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but would you --

would you expect to come to the same result or not?

 MR. LONG: Yes. We would say that if you 

start with 24-7 and the incidental powers of national 

banks and the undisputed point that one of those 

incidental powers is for the national bank --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does it conflict 

with Federal banking authority for the State to audit 

the books of the mortgage subsidiary?

 MR. LONG: Well, it has been established 

since the beginning of the national banking system 

that -- and this goes back to the history of the first 

and second Bank of the United States in McCullough 

against Maryland -- that the national banking system is 

protected from possibly unfriendly State legislation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Take my earlier case 

about the consumer disclosure. Michigan has a law, I 

assume, that any mortgage lender has to tell the 

consumer all this information. Would that conflict with 

the authority of a national bank?

MR. LONG: The Comptroller's view as I 

understand it is that it would. But again let me 

emphasize --

THE COURT: How?

 MR. LONG: Because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think any 

regulation would conflict with the national bank status?

 MR. LONG: Well, I think that may go too 

far. But I think what Comptroller has done, it has --

has been to look at a series of these State regulations 

and determine whether in fact they do impair or impede 

the exercise --

THE COURT: I'm trying to get a handle on 

it. As I understood the case that came, I don't think 

there's disagreement on either side about how conflict 

preemption works. But I thought your position was that 

more is involved here and that the State can't regulate 

it at all, and you're not getting into a conflict 

preemption question. It's just if it's a State 

regulation it can't --

MR. LONG: I think our position is there are 

multiple roots that we can win this case. One is based 

on conflict preemption. Another --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you do take a field 

preemption position, don't you?

JUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, it's truly broader 

than just conflict preemption.

 MR. LONG: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Literally.

 MR. LONG: Yes. And the agency has broad 

rulemaking power. It's exercised it here. There's 

really no dispute about what the OCC's rules mean. The 

only question is whether they're valid and then what is 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your best case for 

the proposition that an agency and not the Congress 

defines the extent of field preemption?

 MR. LONG: That an agency and not the --

certainly the Delaquesta line of cases stand for the 

proposition that if an agency has preempted State law by 

regulation, the questions are simply whether the agency 

has acted within the scope of its delegated authority 

and whether it is a reasonable accommodation of the 

conflicting principles and whether there's any reason to 

think that Congress would have disagreed with it. Are 

there -- I mean, there are examples. For example, in 

the world of Federal thrifts OTS has a sort of field 

preemption as I understand it. It's evolved differently

in the world of national banks. That's conflict 

preemption.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is a functionally 

regulated subsidiary of a depository institution.

 MR. LONG: Well, that that again goes to 

this scheme of GLBA that I was trying to describe. The 

notion that Congress had is that you're going to 

regulate by function. So if it's insurance, the State 

can regulate it whether it's in the subsidiary or in the 

bank. If it's securities, the SEC and in some 

circumstances the States can regulate it. But if it's 

core banking functions like mortgage lending, that's 

going to be regulated subject to the same terms and 

conditions that apply when the bank itself conducts 

those activities.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And is that a functionally 

regulated subsidiary?

 MR. LONG: Yes.

 JUST SCALIA: If it's just engaging in 

banking activities?

 MR. LONG: That is the concept as I 

understand it. It's going by function and we think that

MR. LONG: Wachovia does not, although -- I 

mean, an interesting feature of the Michigan law is if 

they did Michigan's law would not apply, which we think 

is not consistent with their view that the OCC is an 

inadequate regulator, because it would be exactly the 

same whether or not there's a branch.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Are there States in which 

Wachovia has both branch banks and subsidiaries 

comparable to this?

 MR. LONG: Yes, yes. North Carolina and 

others.

 I will add, there was a point at the 

beginning that this Wachovia Mortgage Company actually 

was regulated by Michigan for 6 years and there were no 

problems. During that period it was a subsidiary of a 

bank holding company, and that's a completely different 

situation. Those are not regulated at all by the OCC. 

So of course they were regulated by Michigan. That's 

the way subsidiaries of bank holding companies are 

regulated. That's simply a different situation.

 If there are no further questions, I will --

SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 Let me begin by addressing this question of 

whether what's going on here is conflict preemption or 

field preemption. Now, it depends on how one defines 

those terms. But as we understand it it's conflict 

preemption, not field preemption, in the following 

sense. Our position is not that State laws have no 

application to operating subsidiaries or to national 

banks for that matter. It's that State laws apply to 

the same extent to operating subsidiaries as they would 

to national banks. And as this court has made clear in 

the Atherton case and in the Barnett Bank case, State 

laws do apply to national banks and operating 

subsidiaries in a variety of respects, and State 

contract law would be an example. But with operating 

subsidiaries in particular, State laws dealing with 

corporate governance questions, for example the process 

of incorporation, dissolution, shareholder voting, and 

things of that sort, would be controlling and so federal 

law doesn't control those sorts of aspects.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's field 

preemption when it comes to regulation. Yes, if the 

bank is sued the normal rules of contract are going to

apply for enforcing a contract. But you're claiming 

field preemption with respect to regulation, correct?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I guess it depends on 

the degree to which the regulations apply to the 

national banks. That's my only point, is that State 

laws apply to the same extent to the operating 

subsidiary as to the national bank.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: State laws generally 

-- State agencies generally don't regulate national 

banks at all, right?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: State agencies don't 

generally do that because there's a specific statutory 

prohibition on that. And Justice Scalia, this goes to 

your questions about the scope of these provisions at 12 

U.S.C. 484(a) and 481. It's true that those provisions 

say by their terms that visitorial authority resides 

exclusively with the Comptroller of the Currency with 

respect to national banks, and there's another provision 

that deals with affiliates.

 And so that's the point with visitorial 

authority. But visitorial authority by its very nature 

is asserted in service of and enforcement of some 

underlying substantive requirement, and the underlying 

substantive requirement at issue here is the requirement 

that operating subsidiaries register with the State.

And so there's a question of conflict preemption that 

applies both to the national bank and the operating 

subsidiary of whether that underlying substantive 

registration requirement could be applied to the 

national bank or could be applied to the operating 

subsidiary.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but it is true, is it 

not, that as long as this mortgage company was a 

subsidiary of a holding company rather than the bank 

itself, the State would have done the visiting, the 

visitorial power, whereas once they changed the Federal 

Government assumed that responsibility?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't know what you 

mean by "holding company," Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, as your co-counsel 

pointed out, previously this very company was a 

subsidiary of a holding company that also owned the 

bank, and at that time it was exclusively regulated by 

Michigan.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right, because it 

wasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered 

national bank.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the change in the 

corporate structure is the sole basis for saying now 

it's exclusively regulated by the OCC?

MR. SRINIVASAN: It is, but it's changing 

the corporate structure in a fundamentally important 

way. That's that it's no owned and controlled by a 

federally chartered national bank.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But this results in field 

preemption to the extent that the exercise of visitorial 

power is a regulatory function?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, again it depends on 

how one defines those terms. And I don't take issue 

with the fact that as a consequence of the fact that 

this became a subsidiary --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it is now only the 

Federal agency that does the visiting, whereas it used 

to be only the State agency?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And the question that led 

me to is how many additional personnel did OOC employ 

when it took over this area for 48 States?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't have an 

empirical answer to that question.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it was certainly quite 

a few people, I assume.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: But Justice Stevens, in the 

regulatory materials that attended the promulgation of 

these rules OCC specifically addressed the question

whether it had sufficient resources to exercise 

oversight authority over operating subsidiaries of 

national banks. And let's be clear. It's not that the 

OCC previously had no authority over operating 

subsidiaries. The question is whether the OCC has 

exclusive authority over operating subsidiaries. And 

the OCC determined in the regulatory materials that it 

had sufficient resources to exercise oversight authority 

over operating subsidiaries --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the authority under 

the old regime was just to make sure that the operation 

did not affect the financial stability of the parent 

bank.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: But that's because it 

wasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered 

national bank, and that changes things in a fundamental 

way for the following reason: That under the Barnett 

Bank case the rule of preemption, the special rule of 

preemption that applies in the context of national 

banking, is that when you're dealing with enumerated or 

incidental powers of national banks -- and one 

incidental power of a national bank is undisputed to be 

the power to conduct affairs through an operating 

subsidiary -- that the grants of those powers are 

normally preemptive of rather than preempted by State

law> And so once the operating --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was an effort 

of the State to prohibit the national bank from engaging 

in the activity, correct?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that was. But the 

Court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an obvious 

case of conflict preemption. Here we have a question of 

whether or not the State can regular the operating 

subsidiary to any extent.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: But the Court's decisions 

aren't limited to prohibitions of that sort. I'd make 

two points in that regard. First of all, in one sense 

this is a prohibition, because the operating subsidiary 

can't engage in federally authorized activities unless 

and until it gets the State's permission. So at least 

there is a prohibition at the outset. But more 

importantly, the Court's cases aren't limited to 

situations involving prohibitions of the sort that Your 

Honor posits, because in the Franklin National Bank case 

that was a situation in which the national bank had the 

power to accept savings deposits and the State law that 

was deemed to be preempted there didn't prohibit the 

national bank from accepting savings deposits.

OCC say, well, the corporate law of this State doesn't 

really allow subsidiaries to do as much as we think a 

subsidiary of a national bank ought to be able to do, so 

we're going to attribute additional corporate powers to 

this subsidiary? Can it do that?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, not if you're talking 

about corporate powers, because those are governed by 

State law. What it could do, though, is regulate the 

subsidiary's conduct of the business of banking, 

because, after all, an operating subsidiary has one 

purpose and one purpose only, and that's to carry out 

functions that the national bank itself could perform.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What troubles me, and maybe 

you can answer to it more specifically than you have, is 

that the core function of a banking regulatory agency is 

the visitation power, and the Banking Act makes it very 

clear that there is visitation power to national banks 

and makes it very clear that there is not for 

subsidiaries.

 And here is a regulation which under the 

guise, it seems to me, of defining the powers of the 

national bank simply eliminates that distinction. And 

it seems to me that perhaps goes beyond what an agency 

regulation is allowed to do.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: With respect,

Justice Scalia, I don't think the statutes say that at 

all. There is a statute, 484(a), that says that the 

OCC's visitorial authority is exclusive with respect to 

national banks. But there is no statute that says that 

the OCC's visitorial authority is not exclusive with 

respect to subsidiaries. There's another statute that 

deals with affiliates. Now one point is that affiliates 

are not limited to subsidiaries, but they could include 

for example, I guess brother and sister corporations for 

lack of a better term, that are controlled by a common 

parent. But another point is that at the time these 

statutes were enacted, Congress simply didn't have 

within its field of vision the notion that a national 

bank would have the power to exercise its functions 

through a subsidiary corporation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why should we assume 

that they wanted to preempt state laws to that extent.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Because what Congress was 

trying to do is to make sure that the OCC had exclusive 

visitorial authority with respect to the conduct of 

national bank function. It's just at the time that 

these statutes were enacted, the only play that national 

bank functions were being conducted was by a national 

bank itself. Now later on, when the laws of all 50 

states, the OTS, the Federal Reserve with respect to

state member banks, and the comptroller gives banks the 

authority to conduct national -- to conduct bank 

functions through its subsidiaries, then this issue 

arises about who exercises visitorial authority with 

respect to the conduct of those functions for a 

subsidiary. And it stands to reason that if the 

baseline rule is that with respect to the conduct of 

national bank functions through a national bank itself, 

the OCC visitorial authority is exclusive, then when a 

national bank exercises its Federal entitlement to 

conduct those very same functions through an operating 

subsidiary, the OCC's visitorial authority, likewise, 

would be exclusive. That seems to me to be an entirely 

reasonable regulatory determination by the comptroller, 

and there's nothing in those statutory provisions that 

speaks directly to that issue and that in any way 

precludes the comptroller from reaching that 

determination.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Practically, is there any 

difference between the way they operated when they were 

just a corporation as before, and now a parent and sub?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, there could be. I 

don't know about this particular case but there 

absolutely could be, Justice Ginsburg, because when they 

become subsidiaries they are controlled by the national

bank and not by some other entity. And the reason that 

a national bank would choose to engage in this sort of 

structure rather than folding the enterprise into the 

bank itself are many fold. And in part it's for 

efficiency purposes because you can have focused 

management, especially when you're dealing with the sort 

of specialized things that operating subsidiaries 

typically do. But there's also other reasons. For 

example, there's a modularity component to this in the 

sense that the best specialized functions such as 

mortgage lending, very often a national bank will 

purchase an entity that conducts that activity, and may 

be interested in selling the entity later, and it's much 

more straightforward to do that if those functions are 

maintained in a separate subsidiary corporation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any aspect 

of state law, including liability limitation, that they 

want to take advantage of by establishing a subsidiary 

chartered under state law, Michigan or another state, 

and yet they're claiming immunity from all other state 

regulations?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, with respect to 

liability limitation in particular, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

should clarify that veil piercing principles and things 

of that sort would be governed by state law with respect

to the operating subsidiary. So if the question is 

whether the corporate veil is pierced, state law would 

dictate an answer to that question.

 But, may I just finish one thought?

 States won't have an incentive to liberally 

construe veil piercing principles with respect to 

national banks precisely because state member banks in 

all 50 states also have operating subsidiaries through 

which they charter banks to conduct banking functions.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOHN BLANCHARD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BLANCHARD: Two key points.

 First, Section 484 and 481 have been amended 

subsequent to the time operating subsidiaries came into 

play. Congress knew of operating subsidiaries when it 

amended 484 twice in the 1980s, and 481 was amended four 

times. Yet, never did Congress insert the word 

"affiliates" into the exclusive power of the OCC in 488.

 Secondly, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act is 

being greatly distorted. The same terms and conditions 

language that my opponent referred to was meant to 

return op subs only to the authority that the parent

bank could engage in. It wasn't preemptive or meant to 

preempt the states. The comptroller had issued a 

ruling, 34.F, (f), and they had allowed operating 

subsidiaries to do things differently from the parent 

bank.
