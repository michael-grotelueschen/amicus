3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

4 argument first this morning in Case 10-5400, Tapia v. 

United States. 

6  Mr. Cahn. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF REUBEN C. CAHN 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. CAHN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  When it instructed courts to recognize that 

12 imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting 

13 correction and rehabilitation, Congress intended to end 

14 the practice of sending defendants to prison so that 

they might get treatment. The commands of 3582 are 

16 clear on this point: Do not imprison and do not 

17 lengthen prison sentences for the purposes of 

18 rehabilitation. This plain meaning is confirmed by the 

19 structure of the statute.

 Under the statute, judges have the power to 

21 sentence defendants to prison but not to prison 

22 programs. Judges once had that power under the Youth 

23 Corrections Act and under the Narcotic Addicts 

24 Rehabilitation Act. With the Sentencing Reform Act 

Congress took that power away. That structure makes

1 sense only because Congress intended that defendants 

2 should no longer be sent to prison for purposes of 

3 rehabilitation. 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: You have, in effect, a 

one-way ratchet. If the judge really thinks 

6 rehabilitation is a -- a -- a primary or an important 

7 component of the sentence, then it reduces the prison 

8 term. It could never increase it. So you have a 

9 one-way ratchet.

 MR. CAHN: Yes, Your Honor. I believe that 

11 that's correct, that the -- that the way in which the 

12 statute is set up, the logic of 3582 is that a need for 

13 rehabilitation can push the judge, the sentencing judge, 

14 into moving the individual either out of an 

incarceration sentence into probation or lower the 

16 sentence to get that individual into supervisory release 

17 where rehabilitation current -- concerns are properly 

18 addressed under the statute. 

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that's -- do 

you think that's consistent with what Congress thought 

21 about rehabilitation when it adopted the Sentencing 

22 Reform Act? And you discuss their thinking, and I think 

23 accurately, in your brief, but was their thinking simply 

24 that rehabilitation is very feasible and it's reasonably 

predictable whether somebody can be rehabilitated or has 

4

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 been rehabilitated so long as it's done outside of 

2 prison, but it just doesn't work in prison? Was that 

3 their thinking? 

4  MR. CAHN: Well, there's relatively little 

evidence of what Congress thought about the possibility 

6 of rehabilitating individuals outside of prison. What's 

7 clear is that they doubted that rehabilitation could be 

8 reliably induced in the prison setting. There is at 

9 least one comment that indicates that they doubt that we 

know enough about human behavior to rehabilitate 

11 individuals on a regular basis in any case, but they 

12 certainly -­

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it is strange, isn't 

14 it, that they can take rehabilitation into account for 

the supervised release. I mean, that -- that's a 

16 provision, isn't it? As far as supervised release is 

17 concerned, the judge can take account of rehabilitation 

18 in setting the length of the term, but can't do that for 

19 the prison time.

 MR. CAHN: Well, certainly with regard to 

21 supervised release, we think, as far as setting the term 

22 of supervised release, the judge is required to take 

23 rehabilitation concerns into account, and that's because 

24 supervised release is intended to smooth the transition 

from prison to true liberty and is specifically a 

5

1 rehabilitative vehicle. 

2  Now, with regard to revocation, to the 

3 extent that that's -- that's at issue, we concur with 

4 the Solicitor General that 3582, by its terms, simply 

doesn't govern a revocation of supervised release 

6 because it's not the imposition of a term of 

7 imprisonment but, rather, requiring the individual to 

8 serve a portion of the supervised release term in 

9 prison. So, by its plain terms, it simply isn't 

applicable. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, aren't -- isn't 

12 punishment and rehabilitation often flip sides of each 

13 other? If you read what the judge said here, his 

14 comment was this man -- or this woman, I'm sorry, has 

been involved in a series -- escalating series of 

16 serious offenses. Logically, she has to be put away for 

17 a long time unless she gets rehabilitation because 

18 there's going to be no deterrence otherwise. 

19  And so, what the judge was basically saying, 

in my judgment -- and I don't know why it's not just the 

21 flip, which is without -- without drug treatment, we 

22 can't deter her. And so, this crime, given her 

23 background, deserves this kind of sentence. One of its 

24 by-products is a drug treatment program.

 How different is that, or do you really

1 think that a judge who knows that someone is going to 

2 get a rehab program if they serve 50 months and the 

3 sentencing range is between 45 and 55, do you think that 

4 they're going to take 50 -- they're not going to choose 

50 if they understand that there's no chance for this 

6 person to be deterred without drug treatment? 

7  MR. CAHN: The problem is the judge has no 

8 ability to ensure that the individual gets that 

9 treatment if they're sent to prison.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Your client -­

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a -­

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- didn't get, did she? 

13  MR. CAHN: She did not get that treatment, 

14 in fact. And then, she's past the -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, if he gave her extra 

16 years in order to get that treatment, he just gave her 

17 extra years without the treatment, as it turned out? 

18  MR. CAHN: Yes, and I don't think that was 

19 that -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, wait a minute. 

21 That's the whole point, because what the judge said was 

22 if she doesn't get treatment, she needs to be in jail a 

23 long time because her crime was serious, because she's 

24 just going to continue committing crimes. There's a 

chance if she gets it that she won't, but without it,

1 for sure, she's not, and this is the just punishment she 

2 deserves, this amount of years. That's how I read the 

3 transcript. 

4  MR. CAHN: Well, Judge -- I mean, Justice, I 

would disagree with that characterization of Judge 

6 Moskowitz's comments, and I'd point specifically to the 

7 Joint Appendix, really, at pages 25 through 38, and 

8 particularly to pages 27 through 29, where he very 

9 specifically says not that he's imposing this time for 

punishment purposes, but really to get her into the drug 

11 program. He says: I'm going to impose a 51-month 

12 sentence, 46 months plus 5 months for the bail jump, and 

13 one of the factors that affects this is the need to 

14 provide treatment. In other words, so she is in long 

enough to get the 500-hour drug program. 

16  And then, again, when he actually imposes 

17 sentence, he says -- the judge says: I think a 

18 sentence -- I'm sorry. Well, he says: The court 

19 recommends, strongly recommends, that she participate in 

the 500-hour drug program. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're ignoring his 

22 lengthy discussion talking about she was really going 

23 down the wrong road here. I understand her troubled 

24 past. She gets involved in alien smuggling, which is 

very serious. He is talking at length about the 

8

1 seriousness of the crime. 

2  So what I'm asking you is, if what we see is 

3 a judge who's talking about a flip situation, i.e., you 

4 need to punish strongly because the crimes are serious, 

and an added benefit is rehabilitation, why does that 

6 violate 3582? What about 3582, in using the word 

7 "recognizing," stops a judge from saying without 

8 something there's going to be no deterrence? 

9  MR. CAHN: There's nothing that stops a 

sentencing judge from saying I think that 

11 incapacitation, retribution, deterrence justify a 

12 sentence of X, and in addition you'll receive 

13 rehabilitative resources while you're inside; make -­

14 you know, make best use of them. There's nothing that 

stops a judge from urging a defendant to, in fact, make 

16 better of herself while she's in prison or outside. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're talking only 

18 about when rehabilitation is the primary purpose? So 

19 the issue here is what was the judge's primary purpose?

 MR. CAHN: No. No. Whenever the judge 

21 lengthens a sentence or imposes a sentence of 

22 imprisonment that that judge otherwise would not have 

23 imposed, that is a violation of 3582. You could -­

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now we want some 

talismanic words where the judge says what I said? This

1 crime is so serious that the sentence should be X 

2 amount, and now talismanically I'll say rehab is just a 

3 side effect, really the sentence is motivated by -­

4 completely by punishment?

 MR. CAHN: I think a fair reading of Judge 

6 Moskowitz's statements at the sentencing was that, in 

7 fact, he was lengthening the sentence for purposes of 

8 rehabilitation -­

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, how do we -­

MR. CAHN: -- to make sure that she got into 

11 the -­

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- can we know that when 

13 the government -- didn't the government ask for 63 

14 months?

 MR. CAHN: The government did ask for 63 

16 months. We requested 36 months. There's -- we don't 

17 know with certainty -­

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the judge came up 

19 with something in between those two?

 MR. CAHN: He did, indeed. I believe that 

21 -- that these particular issues are appropriately -- I'm 

22 sorry -- addressed on plain error review in the circuit 

23 court first. I don't think they're essential to the 

24 legal question that's before this Court.

1 he -- this is on page 27 of the Joint Appendix -- "the 

2 sentence has to be sufficient to provide needed 

3 correctional treatment, and here I think the needed 

4 correctional treatment is the 500-hour drug program." 

It couldn't be clearer that he's computing the length of 

6 the sentence on the basis of what correctional treatment 

7 will be received. It "has to be sufficient to provide 

8 needed correctional treatment." 

9  MR. CAHN: Indeed, he did, and I believe 

that he was taking into account his own knowledge of the 

11 prison system and what it would require to allow Ms. 

12 Tapia to participate in the 500-hour program. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- putting 

14 aside the particular statement here, what if a judge 

says: I appreciate that one purpose of punishment is 

16 deterrence; that's what -- and that's what's going to 

17 guide me, and I think you will not be deterred if I only 

18 sentence you for 2 years, but I think if you have to go 

19 away for 3 years, you will appreciate that what you've 

done is wrong and you won't do it again. 

21  Is that for rehabilitation, that extra year, 

22 or is it for punishment? 

23  MR. CAHN: I believe that's for punishment 

24 and deterrence, and I don't believe that's an improper 

purpose.

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, maybe -- what 

2 is the difference between deterrence and rehabilitation? 

3 The person doesn't commit any crimes anymore but wishes 

4 -- wishes she could? Or -- and, well, if she's 

rehabilitated, she doesn't want to? It seems to me it's 

6 a very artificial distinction. 

7  MR. CAHN: Well, I don't think it is, 

8 because I think we can look at the purposes Congress had 

9 in mind when it enacted the statute and, in particular, 

the system it had in mind, the system it intended to 

11 overturn when it enacted the statute. As I mentioned 

12 before, one of the statements, a prominent statement, in 

13 the Senate report that comes up again and again is 

14 Congress doubted that rehabilitation could be reliably 

induced in the prison setting. The system that was 

16 being overturned was one of coercive rehabilitation in 

17 which individuals were sent to prison and prison 

18 sentences were tied to their completion of these 

19 programs.

 And so for that reason, I think when you 

21 look at a sentence that's employed specifically to get 

22 somebody into treatment, it is exactly within the 

23 proscription Congress intended. 

24  If there are no questions at this time, I'd 

ask to reserve the rest of my time, Your Honor.

3  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS 

4  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN SUPPORT OF VACATUR

 MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

6 please the Court: 

7  Section 3582(a) prohibits courts from 

8 imposing or lengthening a term of imprisonment to 

9 promote a defendant's rehabilitation, including by 

facilitating her access to a prison drug treatment 

11 program. 

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Roberts, could I take 

13 you back to Justice Kennedy's question at the start 

14 about the one-way ratchet? What's the government's 

theory about what Congress might have been thinking when 

16 it said you can't think about rehabilitation to sentence 

17 or to lengthen a sentence, but you can think about 

18 rehabilitation to make a decision not to sentence or to 

19 shorten a sentence? What would -- what would have been 

in Congress's mind? 

21  MR. ROBERTS: Well, Congress was intending 

22 to reject the prevailing rehabilitation model of 

23 sentencing, and under that model, defendants were kept 

24 in prison until they were declared rehabilitated based 

on their participation in treatment programs. And what 

13

5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 Congress determined was that -- that coercing 

2 participation in prison programs that way wasn't -- had 

3 failed and that rehabilitation couldn't be accomplished 

4 reliably in a prison setting. So -­

JUSTICE ALITO: That's only one-half of what 

6 the thinking was at the time about rehabilitation. The 

7 thinking was that -- that some people were being 

8 sentenced to coercive rehabilitation, but also that 

9 other people were being paroled before they should be on 

the theory that they had been rehabilitated. It was a 

11 general skepticism about rehabilitation, and that is 

12 inconsistent with the idea that you can take 

13 rehabilitation into account in going down, but you can't 

14 take rehabilitation into account in going up.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, Congress expressly 

16 determined to retain -- there were people that said 

17 rehabilitation never works; it can't be a legitimate 

18 purpose of sentencing. And Congress decided not to go 

19 that far. It expressly retained rehabilitation as a 

purpose of sentencing. That's reflected in section 

21 3553(a)(2)(D). 

22  But what Congress determined was that it -­

23 that because you couldn't reliably induce it in prison, 

24 it wasn't appropriate to deprive defendants of their 

liberty, expend the resources on keeping them in prison 

14

1 for that purpose, but that -- that rehabilitation 

2 remained a possibility, that other forms of sentencing 

3 were appropriate ways to attempt to achieve 

4 rehabilitation, and that's why Congress expressly 

provided that, in imposing a sentence of probation, the 

6 court can require a defendant to participate in 

7 particular treatment programs -­

8  JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, but that's different 

9 from saying that a lower sentence can be imposed on the 

theory that with rehabilitation outside of prison, a 

11 lengthier sentence isn't needed. 

12  Would you agree that when the guidelines 

13 were mandatory a judge could not sentence to -- to 

14 additional time, certainly not additional time outside 

the guideline range for the purpose of rehabilitation, 

16 but the judge also generally could not depart below the 

17 guideline range on the theory that this defendant had 

18 led a life of crime because the defendant lacked 

19 vocational skills or the defendant was dependent on 

drugs or alcohol, and with treatment outside of 

21 incarceration, those problems which had led to the 

22 criminality could be alleviated? 

23  MR. ROBERTS: I think it would depend 

24 whether that was an aggravating or, you know, mitigating 

circumstance that the guidelines hadn't adequately taken 

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 into account, but I don't think that Congress was trying 

2 to prevent a court from selecting another sentencing 

3 option, such as probation, in lieu of imprisonment 

4 because the court determined that the primary purpose of 

the sentence should be rehabilitation, or to shorten the 

6 sentence to speed the defendant from imprisonment to 

7 supervised release, where the court could guarantee the 

8 defendant would participate in programs. 

9  On the other hand, if the -- it was very 

important, if there were important purposes of 

11 protecting the public, deterring the defendant from 

12 committing other crimes, deterring generally, then the 

13 court was supposed to sentence the defendant to prison 

14 in accordance with that, even if the defendant also 

needed rehabilitation. 

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose the 

17 case in which the judge is going to sentence to 2 years 

18 no matter, but there is a 2-year rehabilitation program, 

19 and the defendant is -- the prisoner is receiving that. 

Would you say that, at that point, the prisoner is 

21 receiving an imprisonment term and rehabilitation? 

22  MR. ROBERTS: Well, the prisoner is 

23 receiving an imprisonment term -­

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Hypothetical. The term 

isn't affected by the program, but the judge recommends 

16

1 the program, and the prisoner is receiving it. 

2  MR. ROBERTS: I -­

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you agree the 

4 prisoner is then receiving both an imprisonment term and 

rehabilitation? 

6  MR. ROBERTS: I think the prisoner is 

7 receiving rehabilitative services, yes, in prison -- in 

8 prison, yes. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- so then, we can use 

those two goals of sentencing in -- in the 

11 conjunctive -­

12  MR. ROBERTS: Well -­

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and you can have 

14 imprisonment and rehabilitation at the same time?

 MR. ROBERTS: Congress intended that, even 

16 if a defendant needed rehabilitation, if the other goals 

17 of sentencing such as deterrence and protecting the 

18 public justified a term of imprisonment, that the court 

19 should impose a term of imprisonment. So Congress -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm just talking about a 

21 matter of diction. You would agree there are instances, 

22 in a hypothetical -­

receive imprisonment and rehabilitation at same time?

1  MR. ROBERTS: Yes, yes, but what Congress 

2 wanted courts to -- required courts to recognize was 

3 that imprisonment is not an appropriate means of 

4 promoting rehabilitation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: We're -- we're talking 

6 about what the statute says, and the question indicates, 

7 the hypothetical indicates, that those are not mutually 

8 exclusive. You can have imprisonment and rehabilitation 

9 at same time. Now, this case is a little different 

because she didn't get it, but let's just talk about the 

11 hypothetical. 

12  MR. ROBERTS: I agree that you can -- there 

13 can be rehabilitative programs in prison. But what 

14 Congress was trying to preclude was imposing 

imprisonment for the purpose of providing those programs 

16 or lengthening the imprisonment term for that purpose.

19 treatment programs.

1 judge, this judge -- as the colloquy with Justice Scalia 

2 showed, this judge wanted her to be in the program, but 

3 she never got into it because the judge has no control? 

4  MR. ROBERTS: Exactly, Your Honor. The -­

under the SRA, judges have no authority to place 

6 prisoners in -- place defendants in prison treatment 

7 programs or to require their participation in those 

8 programs. And Petitioner, in fact, did not participate 

9 in the drug treatment program on which the sentencing 

court relied in setting her prison term. 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- what if 

12 the judge sentences people who commit robbery with 

13 assault typically to 1 year; he can do it 1 to 2 years, 

14 he gives them 1 year; except whenever the presentencing 

report says the person has a drug problem and there's a 

16 one-and-a-half-year drug program in the prison, he 

17 sentences those people to one and a half years? 

18 Regularly. But each time he says I recognize 

19 rehabilitation is not a permitted factor; I can send 

sentence this person to one to two, I'm going to pick 

21 one and a half.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think, as I said, that 

11 the words that you -- that the court is required to give 

12 its reasons for imposing sentence. We presume that 

13 district courts honestly give their reasons for imposing 

14 the sentence and that if the court is indeed lengthening 

the term of imprisonment because the court wants the 

16 defendant to be in a program, that the court will say 

17 that's what they're doing, just as Judge Moskowitz did 

18 here. And once this Court makes clear that imprisonment 

19 is not an appropriate means of promoting rehabilitation, 

therefore, courts cannot impose or lengthen a term of 

21 imprisonment to serve that purpose, sentencing courts 

22 will follow that -­

11  JUSTICE ALITO: What if it's not available

defendant in a different location than the defendant

17 don't know that -- that there are such specialized 

18 programs that those things can't be accommodated as a

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can a judge who 

9 believes a defendant is dangerous to the public and 

thinks that that danger can't be abated without a drug 

11 treatment program, could the judge nevertheless under 

12 3553(a)(2)(C) say, because of the danger to the public, 

13 I'm going to lengthen the sentence? 

14  MR. ROBERTS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And in the hopes that a 

16 drug rehabilitation program will be available? I don't 

17 care if it is or it's not; this person's dangerous to 

18 the community otherwise? 

19  MR. ROBERTS: I think the judge can say that 

-- that this person needs to be in prison for this 

21 amount of time to protect the public. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what's different than 

23 what the judge did here, where he talked about, 

24 explicitly, on page 26, "it has to deter" -- the 

sentence has to deter criminal conduct by others, and it

 So, if the sentence has a dual motive, is 

6 that okay?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANOS BIBAS 

6  ON BEHALF OF THE AMICUS CURIAE 

7  MR. BIBAS: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, 

8 and may it please the Court: 

9  Sentencing judges may consider needed 

correctional treatments in deciding both whether to 

11 imprison and for how long. The Sentencing Reform Act 

12 rejected the rehabilitation model's unstructured 

13 sentencing procedures designed to confine every inmate 

14 indefinitely until a parole board found he had reformed 

himself. 

16  It did not, however, forbid treatment 

17 programs targeting specific defendants' pathologies, 

18 such as the drug treatment at issue here. The Act 

19 rejected one means of promoting rehabilitation that was 

bound up with indeterminate sentencing, not 

21 rehabilitation itself. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I could follow your 

23 argument much better if the judge could say that this 

24 specialized program -- as I am making that a term of 

your incarceration. The disturbing factor about your 

27
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 argument is the judge can only recommend; the judge has 

2 no way of making sure that this person will be in prison 

3 longer and get the treatment the -- the judge wants, 

4 because the judge can't control where the person will 

serve her sentence and what treatment will be available 

6 for her. 

7  MR. BIBAS: Your Honor, I don't believe 

8 that's a large concern for several reasons. The first 

9 is this Residential Drug Abuse Program, RDAP, is given 

to 93 percent of eligible defendants. The only reason 

11 Petitioner did not get it is because she affirmatively 

12 refused, said she was not interested. 

13  The second point I would make is that if we 

14 look at the legislative history, the Petitioner and the 

government's reply brief say, well, this Act stripped 

16 judges of the power to do this. The Senate report makes 

17 clear this was a simple administrative simplification 

18 designed to make it clear that the Bureau of Prisons 

19 ultimately controlled all of these things but that at 

the same time it was supposed to listen seriously to 

21 judges' recommendations. It was not -­

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wasn't there something -­

23 you responded that she didn't -- she said I'd rather 

24 not. But wasn't there something about placing her 

with -- in the same facility as another inmate? Wasn't

1 that involved? 

2  MR. BIBAS: There were two distinct issues 

3 here. One was putting her in the particular prison that 

4 was named was not possible because she needed to be 

separated from another inmate. The other is whether she 

6 could be put in a facility that had one of these 

7 programs. About half of prisons -- Federal prisons do, 

8 and the reason she didn't get that was because she 

9 refused, she said she wasn't interested.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know why you 

11 consider that that solves your case, that that makes 

12 everything okay. She refused it. She would not have 

13 been able to refuse it had it been made a condition of 

14 her supervised release. You either take the program or 

you go back to jail. I mean, that's -- why is that an 

16 insignificant difference? 

17  The fact is the judge has no control over 

18 whether this person gets the rehabilitation that was 

19 supposedly the purpose of the -- of the extended prison 

term. 

21  MR. BIBAS: A couple of -­

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: It makes no sense. 

23  MR. BIBAS: I just note, Your Honor, first 

24 of all, the statute requires judges to make predictions 

about deterrence. That is a forward-looking matter.

1 The fact that a judge must predict the future calls for 

2 appropriate skepticism and a statement of reasons in 

3 appellate review. It does not mean that a judge may not 

4 consider deterrence because it's a speculative 

possibility. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: You're -- you're not 

7 responding to my point. You're -- you're -- you're 

8 making a different point. I'm saying that it's -- it -­

9 it -- it does not help your case that the reason she did 

not get the rehabilitative treatment that this judge 

11 wanted her to get was that she simply refused it. Why 

12 does that help your case? She couldn't have refused it 

13 if, as the other side says, had to be the case, he had 

14 imposed this rehabilitative measure as a portion of 

supervised release. Then she would have had to take it. 

16  MR. BIBAS: Your Honor is correct that there 

17 is a contingency involved here, but the contingency 

18 involved is no greater than the contingency involved in 

19 other sentencing decisions judges must make and that is 

a reason for skepticism. It doesn't imply that the Act 

21 meant to disable judges from doing this. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bibas, I -- I -- I have 

23 to say I don't really understand the whole premise of 

24 your argument. You're basically saying the judge cannot 

consider rehabilitation, but the judge can consider 

30

1 educational programs, vocational programs, treatment 

2 programs, and so forth. 

3  I think most people would think that all of 

4 those things are rehabilitation, that there's nothing 

left over when you say that the judge can consider all 

6 of those things. 

7  MR. BIBAS: Your Honor, I don't believe you 

8 phrased correctly. Our point is not that judges can't 

9 consider rehabilitation. It is that judges may not use 

imprisonment as the means of promoting rehabilitation. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. Well, I'll ask the 

12 same question. 

13  MR. BIBAS: Yes. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: You're saying they can 

consider rehabilitation in imposing a sentence, they 

16 cannot consider rehabilitation in imposing a sentence, 

17 but they can consider all these programs in imposing a 

18 sentence. And I'm saying what's the difference between 

19 all these programs and rehabilitation? Once you say 

they -- they can consider all these programs, what's 

21 left over that they can't consider? 

22  MR. BIBAS: Your Honor, I think the answer 

23 is clear if we look at the statutory text. It's in 

24 Petitioner's brief, the blue brief at Appendix 2 and 

Appendix 3. The contrast becomes clear if we look at 

31

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 3553(a)(2)(D). There were four simple purposes of 

2 punishment the judge must consider. And (D) is not 

3 everything that was ever considered rehabilitation. It 

4 is a specifically limited subset of rehabilitation.

 It must be needed, must be educational or 

6 vocational training, medical care or other correctional 

7 treatment, and it must be in the most effective manner. 

8  So, judges may no longer rest on what Judge 

9 Frankel and the -- the Senate decried as the eerie 

nonsense that everyone can be rehabilitated simply by 

11 throwing them in prison or simply by having everybody 

12 going to social workers or classes, but because 

13 criminality is not a pathology that needs treatment. 

14 But he and the Senate report contrasted that with drug 

treatment, which is very different, because there's a 

16 diagnosed pathology, there is a criterion for success 

17 that's measurable, and there's a fixed limited time. 

18  And that third point is crucial here, 

19 because both Petitioner and the government in their 

argument said that you can't keep someone in jail tied 

21 to completion of programs or keep them in until he has 

22 been rehabilitated through treatment. The indeterminant 

23 aspect here was a crucial part of what Congress was 

24 targeting that's very different from -­

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 crucial provision of the statute. Yes, you read the -­

2 the section entitled imposition of a sentence, but there 

3 is another provision in the statute which says 

4 imposition of a sentence of imprisonment. You can 

indeed consider those factors in imposing the sentence, 

6 which includes probation, supervised release and any 

7 other matters. But what -- what 3582(a) says is that 

8 the court in determining whether to impose a -- whether 

9 to impose a term of imprisonment as opposed to just 

parole or -- or supervised release, and if a term of 

11 imprisonment is to be imposed and determining the length 

12 of term shall consider the factors set forth in, that 

13 you mentioned in 3553(a) to the extent they are 

14 recognizing that imprisonment is not an appropriate 

means of promoting correction and rehabilitation. 

16  You have to reconcile the two sections. And 

17 the way to reconcile them is to say that the former 

18 applies to sentencing in general but when you're dealing 

19 with the length of a sentence of imprisonment or whether 

there should be any imprisonment at all, you cannot 

21 consider rehabilitation. 

22  MR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know any other way 

24 to read it.

 MR. BIBAS: No, Your Honor. The main clause 

33
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 of 3582(a) says shall consider the factors set forth in 

2 3553(a). It does not say (a)(2) -- (a), (a)(2)(B) and 

3 (a)(2)(C). As the very next section of the sentencing 

4 format goes, 3583 says consider only these purposes, but 

3582 says consider all of these factors to the extent 

6 they apply in a particular case. 

7  Now, the way Your Honor reads the 

8 recognizing clause is as if it said, except the court 

9 shall not consider in imposing or lengthening a sentence 

(a)(2)(D) or if it tracked the language of (a)(2)(D). 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: I -- I don't know what else 

12 recognizing that factor would consist of, except you 

13 won't use that factor in deciding imprisonment or length 

14 of term of imprisonment.

 MR. BIBAS: Your Honor, we've looked through 

16 the entire United States Code. We have not found a 

17 single instance in which a recognizing clause is used to 

18 mean an exception -­

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you tell me what it 

means here, then. What, he -- he should say, you know, 

21 I recognize that rehabilitation is not a -- an 

22 appropriate factor to take into account in determining 

23 the length of your sentence or the -- or whether you 

24 should go to jail at all. That said, I'm going to send 

you to jail in order to rehabilitate you.

1  (Laughter.) 

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that all it means? 

3  MR. BIBAS: Your Honor, a recognize -- we 

4 found dozens of instances in the U.S. Code where 

recognizing introduces a statement of principle or 

6 policy or rationale. Petitioner or the government cite 

7 no instances in which it's used to impose a flat ban. 

8  What we point out is -- Justice Kennedy made 

9 the point that logically there is a distinction between 

the imprisonment and the treatment that occurs during 

11 the imprisonment. And if it's recognizing that the 

12 imprisonment is not an appropriate means of promoting 

13 correction rehabilitation, that itself bans a 

14 penological policy that was known in our history and had 

been known into the 1970s. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: But the judge only has the 

17 power to impose imprisonment. He does not have the 

18 empower to impose anything else during the imprisonment. 

19 I mean, what you're saying might make sense if indeed he 

could prescribe some treatment during imprisonment, but 

21 he can't. There are prisons -- and why can't he, by the 

22 way? Why has he been prevented from doing that, 

23 although he's allowed to do it during supervised 

24 release? Does that make any sense, if indeed, as you 

say, he can take that into account in imprisonment?

1  MR. BIBAS: Your Honor, judges in supervised 

2 release, it -- it -- it's hard to understand why in 

3 3583(e)(3) judges may consider rehabilitation in 

4 deciding whether to impose a term of imprisonment on 

resentencing, and we've been offered no logical 

6 explanation as to why that same logic Congress would 

7 have meant a flat ban here that it didn't spell out in 

8 an initial sentencing. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it does seem to me 

that the principal trouble I have with your argument is 

11 that, as Justice Scalia mentioned, the judge can't be 

12 certain that the treatment will -- will be provided. 

13 And in an answer to an earlier question you said, well, 

14 90 percent of the time the judge's recommendation is 

followed, the program is -- is offered. 

16  Suppose we're only 10 percent of the time? 

17 Suppose only 10 percent of the time could or did the 

18 Bureau of Prisons follow the judge's recommendation, 

19 wouldn't your interpretation of the statute then be very 

difficult to sustain? 

21  MR. BIBAS: Justice Kennedy, while I agree 

22 that the reliability of the prediction is an important 

23 factor, I think this is dealt with through the ordinary 

24 appellate review that this Court has fleshed out in 

Rita, Gall, and Kimbrough. If there's 93 percent

1 likelihood, predictability, here, then the judge can 

2 give it a fair amount of weight as the judge can give a 

3 fair amount of weight to deterrence calculations. If 

4 it's highly unpredictable, then the judge shouldn't be 

putting very much weight on that at all. 

6  And I would point out particularly that if 

7 we look at those appellate review cases, it's very 

8 relevant that the judge here imposed a sentence within 

9 the range. As Justice Sotomayor pointed out, there are 

multiple explanations going on here; the judge arrives 

11 at a sentence within the range. It's hard to tell here 

12 that it's even a but-for cause versus just a hope. 

13  The -- the thicket of issues that 

14 Petitioner's and the government's reading forces 

appellate courts into in disentangling sentences that 

16 are otherwise reasonable, that are within the range that 

17 could have been justified any number of ways, counsels 

18 against requiring us to say one factor is categorically 

19 forbidden in the sentencing format.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bibas, just practically 

21 speaking what does this clause instruct a court not to 

22 do in your view? 

23  MR. BIBAS: It instructs a court to bear in 

24 mind that simply locking someone in a cell away from his 

criminal associates, away from his pattern of life, is

1 not itself going to reform him. We've been down that 

2 road. 

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, really who thought 

4 that? This was 1984. When people talked about 

rehabilitation, they were talking about drug programs, 

6 they were talking about education programs, they were 

7 talking about vocation programs. They were not talking 

8 about some idea that had passed away long since, that 

9 just locking you in a cell was going to rehabilitate 

you. 

11  MR. BIBAS: A couple of responses that I 

12 think show that to be incorrect. The first of these is 

13 most of the references in the Senate report are to just 

14 generic open-ended education, vocation, and counseling. 

We see maybe one reference to alcohol and drug treatment 

16 in there. 

17  The second of these is that idea of 

18 isolation, though it had diminished, was still alive in 

19 the 1970s. There was a widely cited manual for judges, 

the "Guides for Sentencing" in 1974, that said that 

21 confinement, quote, "may be necessary to break criminal 

22 associations and in time to modify antisocial attitudes 

23 and tendencies." 

24  My third point is this is not just about the 

substantive idea of rehabilitating. The government and

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't your 

11 proposal lead to unevenness in sentencing? If you -- if 

12 you're right, then this choice of extending a term to 

13 accommodate a drug program, that could be -- the judge 

14 would have the option. I think nearly half of the 

people who are incarcerated have a drug addiction. So 

16 one judge might say: I'm not going to let that person 

17 out until they -- they should at least have a chance to 

18 get into this program. And another will say: I can't 

19 control that; I'm not going to subject -- you would be 

introducing that, just what the framers of the Reform 

21 Act were trying to get away from, that this swings from 

22 one judge to another, and you're dealing with almost 

23 half the prison population. 

24  MR. BIBAS: A couple of points. One is, 

statistically I think the number is lower than you say.

1 The RDAP program here requires 12 months before 

2 admission having a provable addiction or abuse, so it's 

3 about 30, 35 percent of inmates. 

4  But granted that issue, that's why the 

Sentencing Reform Act requires statements of reasons, 

6 subject to appellate review. If judges are varying 

7 widely, this Court's case law in Rita, Gall, and 

8 Kimbrough allows appellate courts to harmonize what 

9 they're doing. If this judge had added 5 years to her 

sentence, this would be a different case. Judge 

11 Franklin and others were concerned about sentences 

12 exceeding 5 years, open-ended, airy hopes that everyone 

13 will be cured of criminality. 

14  We're talking about a sentence within the 

range, sentence that, if a few lines of the transcript 

16 had been whited out we wouldn't be here. A judge could 

17 have reached the same sentence on a lot of different 

18 grounds. And are we going to tell judges you can 

19 consider other things, but if you muse about this ground 

you can't offer a thoughtful, reasoned justification -­

21 per se automatic reversal. 

22  There are only a couple of places in the 

23 Sentencing Reform Act that have categorical bans and 

24 they don't read the way this one does. The very next 

section in the Act, 3583(c) says: "In considering a

1 supervised release sentence, a judge shall consider the 

2 factors in 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), and 

3 (a)(2)(D). 

4  It skips over retribution explicitly where 

Congress meant to omit it. 

6  The other place in the Act where Congress 

7 explicitly banned the factor was in 28 U.S.C. 994(d). 

8 The commission, the sentencing commission, not a judge, 

9 shall ensure that the guidelines are entirely neutral 

with respect to race, sex, creed, national original, and 

11 socioeconomic status. When Congress meant to ban 

12 something, even within the range, it spoke much more 

13 clearly. What it did usually was it gave some guidance 

14 to the sentencing commission. And section 994 has a 

number of places where the commission shall do this, the 

16 commission shall ensure that this is generally an 

17 appropriate or inappropriate. 

18  But it left a range, and it simultaneously 

19 said judges should individualize sentences within that 

range. 991(b)(1)(B) says there are factors not 

21 adequately taken into account in the guidelines that can 

22 lead to aggravating or mitigating, and judges can also 

23 adjust sentences to individualize them within the range.

1 appellate review? If rehabilitation can always be a 

2 factor, then when and how does a court of appeals 

3 determine whether a judge has abused his or her 

4 discretion? You said 5 years, if the guideline range 

presumably is 24 months and the judge adds 5 years. But 

6 how do you define that? 

7  The simple answer is if the judge is 

8 imposing the sentence because of rehabilitation, they 

9 can't do that. Is that what you're arguing or are you 

arguing they can do it except within a range? I'm not 

11 quite sure I understand how far you're going. 

12  MR. BIBAS: I understand, Justice Sotomayor. 

13 Our primary argument is that 3582's recognizing clause 

14 isn't about this at all. This is dealt with by 

3553(a)(3)(D), what is it that's needed correctional 

16 treatment, and if it fits within (a)(2)(D), ordinary 

17 appellate review. 

18  If the Court is not comfortable with that 

19 and thinks that there ought to be more discouragement, 

we do have a fallback argument that says that the Senate 

21 report talks about discouraging using this as the sole 

22 basis, right, but that if it's one of several factors, 

23 if it appears to be given a proper balanced weight, then 

24 there's no need to be so suspicious of it. And indeed,

1 we've surveyed the most recent 150 or so cases on 

2 rehabilitation in the courts -- we see very rarely -­

3 first of all, we haven't found any cases where judges 

4 are putting someone into prison versus out based solely 

on this. 

6  We find only a couple of cases where judges 

7 appear to be lengthening a sentence solely because of a 

8 desire to put someone into drug treatment. Usually, 

9 what's happening is something like what happened here. 

The judge is balancing three or four factors; it's in 

11 the mix; the judge might well have gotten the same 

12 result anyway. 

13  Are we going to forbid courts to have that 

14 kind of reasoned, open review, subject to appellate 

review, in order to ban something that isn't banned in 

16 the way that 994 bans race and sex or 3583 bans 

17 retribution? It's simply not the way the statute words 

18 things elsewhere and it's not the wording Congress chose 

19 here, especially since this -- it's a subordinate 

clause, it's hidden, it's not at all clear in 

21 undercutting the main clause of 3582 in saying shall 

22 consider all the factors of punishment here to the 

23 extent they apply in an individual case.

1 position to ignore the 90 percent-10 percent 

2 hypothetical problem I have, to say, well now, 90 

3 percent of the time the judge's rules are going to be 

4 followed or the judge's recommendations are going to be 

followed. That's an odd way to support the 

6 interpretation of the statute that we have to -- that we 

7 have to adopt in order to rule in your favor because, as 

8 I say, suppose his position, his recommendation, were 

9 followed only 10 percent of the time?

 MR. BIBAS: Justice Kennedy, first of all, 

11 there are programs out there for which the judge's 

12 recommendation is a prerequisite and 100 percent of the 

13 people who get into the program are ones whom the judge 

14 recommended. There are some drug education programs, I 

believe a mental health or sex offender program, where 

16 there's a link between those two. It's just this 

17 particular program that we're talking about. 

18  The second point is, as I said, one of the 

19 explicit purposes of sentencing is deterrence. A judge 

can never guarantee that he's going to deter a 

21 particular offender from committing a crime in the 

22 future. The judge has to make an educated prediction 

23 with the help of the probation or pretrial services 

24 officer's report, and that's subject to appellate 

review. But the fact of the prediction, the fact of

12 with me for your colleagues who like legislative

9 sense does it make to still allow the judge to take this 

into account, but affirmatively deprive him of the power 

11 to do what he wanted to do? 

12  MR. BIBAS: Your Honor, I believe that there 

13 were some legal issues that were coming up in litigation 

14 over prison conditions and sentencing in the years 

leading up to this Act, where there was unclarity as to 

16 whether the Attorney General or the judge or the Bureau 

17 of Prisons -- whose decision ultimately was being 

18 challenged in this litigation. And the Act made that 

19 change, but it was designed only to simplify the 

administration. It was not meant to say that judges 

21 therefore are cut out of the process, and unfortunately 

22 that's all that we know about that provision. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the Senate report 

24 says that the provisions we've been talking about make 

clear a defendant should not be sent to prison only

1 because the prison has a program that might be good for 

2 him. Drug dependence in the committee's view generally 

3 should not play a role in the decision whether or not to 

4 incarcerate the offender. Is there something that 

conflicts with that? 

6  Because that was pretty clear indication of 

7 the committee's view. 

8  MR. BIBAS: Your Honor, the committee in 

9 dealing with drug dependence said the commission shall 

decide whether drug dependence, etcetera, is relevant, 

11 shall take it into account only to the extent that it is 

12 relevant; and the commission decided as with most of 

13 these other factors that drug dependence shall not be 

14 used ordinarily in sentencing outside the range, but 

left it to the judge to decide within the range. 

16  As to your -- so judges have some 

17 flexibility in using drug dependence for 

18 within-guideline sentencing. 

19  And then on your point about a person should 

not be sent to prison only because the prison has a -­

21  JUSTICE BREYER: You put a great deal of 

22 weight on the word only. I guess if it's a dual motive

whole thing back for resentencing?

1  MR. BIBAS: No, I think this goes to Justice 

2 Sotomayor's question. That very often these things are 

3 bound up and judge ought to be able to consider it in 

4 the mix, especially when it's not just a program that 

quote, "might" be good for him this -- this airy hope 

6 that everybody who has criminality can be cured -- but 

7 specifically there's a specific targeted program. 

8  Particularly where, as here, Congress made a 

9 point of approving of in-prison drug treatment as 

effective to reduce recidivism where we have a fixed 

11 term and a specific diagnosis that Congress has funded 

12 and encouraged with a 12-month sentence reduction. 

13  If this Court has no further questions, the 

14 statute allows judges to consider needed correctional 

treatment programs in prison sentencing. The judgment 

16 of the court of appeals should therefore be affirmed.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

21  MR. CAHN: Thank you, Your Honor. 

22  Let me begin with a couple points about the 

23 plain language of this statute. When a defendant is 

24 sent to prison so that he can gain access to 

rehabilitative programs, imprisonment is used as a means 

48

1 to promote rehabilitation. Counsel stresses only the 

2 imprisonment portion of that sentence, but it is 

3 strictly speaking within the very prohibition that 

4 Congress has articulated.

 Beyond that I would point to 3553(a)(2)(D), 

6 and counsel has left off the last few words in 

7 discussing that purpose of sentencing that's set out 

8 there. Congress required that these rehabilitative 

9 resources be provided in the most effective manner. As 

is discussed in the brief, Congress had determined with 

11 regard to in-prison rehabilitation programs that they 

12 simply were not the most effective manner. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, this makes a 

14 lot of sense when we're talking about huge disparities 

in a guideline sentence, versus one where the judge goes 

16 outside the guidelines or imposes a greater sentence 

17 than otherwise the guidelines would determine for 

18 rehabilitation purposes. 

19  But not infrequently guideline ranges are 

within very narrow scopes, and in fact there are some 

21 prison advantages that you get from being sentenced to a 

22 year and a day that you don't get if you're sentenced to 

23 12 months; and district courts routinely will choose 

24 between a year and a day or 12 months based on knowledge 

about what might be available if you're there for over a 

49

1 year. Why is that wrong? 

2  What would be the difference? You see, I'm 

3 having a hard time in this case, because if a judge 

4 comes in and says guideline range is 50 to 60, I think 

in the middle is perfectly fine, I just don't know 

6 whether I should give him 54 or 55 months, but I know 

7 that at 55 months there's this kind of program 

8 available. I'm going to do -- I'm going to -- you know, 

9 it is -- judging is not so precise that you know exactly 

where to go within the small ranges, and so there are 

11 many factors that influence that decision. Why should 

12 we announce a rule that says to a judge in those 

13 situations, don't give him that extra month? 

14  MR. CAHN: Because Congress has prescribed 

it. Because Congress made the choice that it shouldn't 

16 be allowed; and it may seem unreasonable to all of us, 

17 but Congress made a determination that it wasn't 

18 appropriate to lengthen these sentences or impose them 

19 for purposes of rehabilitation.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Are you arguing for 

21 something like a plain statement rule, if the judge says 

22 plainly, I'm increasing your sentence so you can get 

23 rehabilitation, then there's a problem? Or would there 

24 possibly be situations in which one could infer that the 

desire to provide for rehabilitation in prison had

1 influenced the sentence? For example, choosing a

3 take advantage of a particular rehabilitation program in 

4 a -- in a prison, or where the judge goes on and on and 

on about the need for rehabilitation for this -­

6 vocational training for this prisoner? 

7  MR. CAHN: It's possible, but I think that 

8 this Court entrusts sentencing judges to follow its 

9 mandate, and if this Court says you're not to increase 

sentences for the purposes of getting people into 

11 rehabilitative programs, then you should state why 

12 you're putting people in prison, that we can count on 

13 those reasons to be honestly and truthfully given.
