 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next this morning in Case 09-6822, Pepper v. United 

States.

 Mr. Parrish.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALFREDO PARRISH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PARRISH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Having successfully completed drug treatment 

in prison and having come home to succeed as a college 

student, valued employee, and family man, Jason Pepper 

presents to this Court two questions: Whether 

post-sentencing rehabilitation is a permissible basis 

for a downward variance from the sentencing guidelines 

at resentencing, and whether the district court judge in 

Pepper's resentencing was bound by the law of the case 

doctrine in its 5K departure ruling absent new facts, 

changes in the controlling law, or to avoid a manifest 

injustice.

 Post-sentencing rehabilitation has 

traditionally been a relevant factor for judges to 

consider and is now a permissible ground for a

non-guideline sentence. 3553(a) and 3661 are the 

authorities permitting post-sentencing rehabilitation as 

a consideration for variance.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I think 

you -- I think you've got a difficult job navigating 

between your two issues. It seems on the first one, the 

40 percent to 20 percent, you're saying: Look, you've 

got to stick with what you did before. And when it gets 

to the post-sentencing consideration, you're saying: 

Well, we can -- all bets are off; we can start -- start 

anew; we can look at things that have happened since.

 Is there a way you reconcile that -­

those -- that tension?

 MR. PARRISH: They're like apples and 

oranges. The law of the case doctrine is what you refer 

to as a matter that's left in the district court. The 

other issue of the -- whether or not the individual 

qualifies for downward variance is a completely separate 

issue. The law of the case remains with the district 

court judge.

 In the other issue that we have, it's 

whether or not he's entitled to a downward variance 

based upon the book of remedies. So they are not, in 

fact, the same issues.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the law of the case -­

MR. PARRISH: And there is no tension -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If the law in the case is 

left to the district court, then the district court can 

say, well, the law of the case -- that's what that other 

judge said, but it was a question of what's a reasonable 

time, and I'm -- I appraise it differently.

 The -- the judgment has been vacated, the 

sentence has been vacated, so how does the law of the 

case survive? I mean, is -- the judgment is no 

longer -­

MR. PARRISH: The law of the case survives 

on a couple of basic principles. One, there has to be 

new facts that the district court judge heard; there has 

to be a change of controlling law; and there has to be a 

reason to avoid a manifest injustice.

 If you go back to the 5K, one departure that 

the first judge made the decision on, that law -- that 

was the law of the case. That percentage followed 

Mr. Pepper straight through the process. That's a 

totally separate ruling from any of the other factors in 

this case that relate to his downward variance.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can a district judge say 

later on in the process: I made a ruling earlier in the 

case; I've since done a lot of research, and I now think 

that that ruling was wrong?

MR. PARRISH: Absolutely, they can do that. 

The circumstances would be, did they see new facts? Was 

there a change of controlling law? The reason we do 

this is because we want to have confidence in that 

decision to make sure litigants don't go judge shopping.

 So that's part of the reason this law of the 

case doctrine is in there. Even in Judge Posner's 

Seventh Circuit decision we cite in our brief, you defer 

to the first judge. But any time a judge can 

reconsider; there's no problem with that.

 But the law of the case in the 5K departure, 

when the first district judge heard substantial evidence 

with regard to the issue of cooperation, and that's what 

he did. When the next judge heard it, she heard no new 

facts, no change in controlling law, and absolutely 

heard no evidence with regard to -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's kind of 

a fortuitous situation, then. You're sort of saying if 

you end up with the same judge, she can reconsider her 

own prior determination. But if you, for whatever 

reason, the death of the first judge, you're in a 

different judge, she's bound by what went before. That 

doesn't seem right.

 MR. PARRISH: Well, that's an excellent

example -- bound by -- but you have to look at the law 

of the case and make a decision whether or not new facts 

came in, there was a change of controlling law. 

Otherwise, you are still stuck, as law of the case, with 

that particular information. If new facts came in -­

judge?

 MR. PARRISH: Even with the original judge. 

Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless there are new facts 

or some -- some new -­

MR. PARRISH: New facts, a change in 

controlling law, or other factor. It's a basic concept, 

and that's why a lot of cases are not floating around 

about that. Plus the government -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm -- I'm a 

little confused.

 MR. PARRISH: Sure.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought that the 

entire premise of Booker was that judges should have 

full discretion under 3553 to balance the factors that 

are required by the statute to be balanced and to come 

to what they believe is the appropriate sentence.

 If we impose, in a resentencing, in a remand 

order that has vacated a prior sentence, a limitation on

that power, don't we in turn do exactly what you're 

arguing in your first half of your appeal, which is 

unconstitutionally tie the hands of the judge? I think 

that was what Justice -- the Chief Justice was getting 

to in his first question.

 MR. PARRISH: That's absolutely -- that's 

why they are apples and oranges. If you go to the 

Booker decision with regard to Mr. Pepper -- and Mr. 

Pepper's decision is under the remedial remedy that we 

are asking that you impose in this case -- Mr. Pepper's 

case is still on direct appeal.

 As a matter of fact, if the restrictions 

placed upon 3742(g)(2), if they remained, Mr. Booker 

would not have gotten the advantage of the remedial 

ruling in the case. Actually, he was entitled to it as 

part of the Sixth Amendment.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why isn't a new 

sentence just that: A new sentence? And the judge, 

whoever the judge is, can do what they're supposed to 

do, which is to look at all of the factors and weigh 

them as that judge believes is appropriate, assuming the 

remand order is not a limited order.

 MR. PARRISH: They can look at all of the 

facts, if there are new facts presented. The difference 

is, in the law of the case, there were no new facts. In

this case, there were new facts to consider, which would 

be part of the post-sentencing rehabilitation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -­

MR. PARRISH: In that issue, the Eighth 

Circuit rule that prohibited this was not even part of 

the 3742(g)(2) statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but one -- one of the 

new facts that -- that is before a judge on remand is 

that part of the basis for his decision has been 

eliminated. He -- he gave additional time because of a 

certain factor, and the court of appeals says: Oh, no, 

you can't look at that factor. And then he looks at the 

whole thing. He says: Gee, without that factor this 

guy is getting off scot-free.

 You mean he cannot -- he cannot readjust his 

other discretionary judgments in light of the fact that 

this additional factor doesn't exist? That seems 

rather -- I don't -- counterintuitive, I guess.

 MR. PARRISH: Well -- well, Justice Scalia, 

under the issue that's presented to the Court, if you 

mix law of the case doctrine with the 3742 problem, it 

creates a problem in analysis. That's why they have to 

be analyzed separately.

 A judge can look at new facts, even under 

the remand statute, now that they are restricted to the

facts that were part of the first case. That's what 

3742(g)(2) does. It makes the guideline sentences 

mandatory on remand. That's the problem with it.

 If they become mandatory on remand, the 

problem is nobody gets the advantage of the Booker 

remedial ruling of it directly, and all sentences on 

remand are mandatory. Even in the Booker decision, you 

make it -- which Mr. Pepper was a recipient of, because 

his case was going on during that time -- he did not 

ever get the benefit of the Booker decision. When it 

was sent back, he never did. Mr. Booker, under 

3742(g)(2), never would have gotten that advantage.

 And there were several other factors that 

were coming into play where people would never get 

advantage of the Booker ruling.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what do you do with 

3742(g)(2)?

 MR. PARRISH: You excise it. You discussed 

it in the Booker decision. And in the Booker decision, 

you indicated, Justice Ginsburg, that you excised two of 

the other -- 3553(b); you also exercise -- excised 

3742(e), which made the sentences on remand mandatory.

 In this case, 3742(g)(2)(A) and (B) were 

left open. And what happens then, the district court 

judge has to come back. Once they look at the decision,

they are bound within those original facts. They can't 

go outside of those facts to decide something different 

or to permit a variance.

 The Eighth Circuit didn't use that rule. 

What we are suggesting is that you excise that rule. 

You excise 3742(g)(2) and you excise (A) and (B) of that 

section.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Would it be consistent with 

Booker for Congress to pass a statute that says the 

following? When a judge initially imposes a sentence, 

the judge must specify all of the factors that the judge 

thinks are relevant to that sentence, whether it's going 

to be a sentence within the guidelines or a sentence 

that's outside of the guidelines, and if there is then a 

remand, the judge may impose a sentence based on the 

factors that were listed at the initial sentencing but 

not based on any other factors.

 MR. PARRISH: Justice Alito, Congress could 

do that. Unfortunately, that's not what they did in 

this case. The 3742, which came down as part of the 

PROTECT Act -- in that case, Booker came after that. 

So, consequently, 3742(g)(2) is problematic. It -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that exactly what 

3742(g)(2) does?

 MR. PARRISH: It does not.

JUSTICE ALITO: It says -- well, under 

3553(c), the sentencing judge is supposed to explain the 

factors that justify the sentence that's imposed. And 

that would -- that means explain a sentence outside of 

the guidelines; also explain why the judge chooses a 

particular sentence within the guidelines range.

 MR. PARRISH: Well, what -­

JUSTICE ALITO: And 3742(g)(2) says that 

when there's a remand, the judge may take into account 

all the factors that were mentioned the first time, but 

not other factors.

 MR. PARRISH: Well, Justice Alito, let me 

give you an example. What if they didn't state the 

reasons and you go up on the variance from the district 

court decision saying you didn't get the stated reasons? 

The appellate court then sends that decision back, and 

the judge is then bound by those facts. And if they 

didn't find all of the facts, suppose again they went up 

on a presumption that the guidelines were, in fact, 

reasonable. In that instance, you wouldn't get anything 

for the judge to work from.

 And, absolutely, they work from facts now 

within the guidelines. You take the Stapleton case 

that's in the Eighth Circuit that's cited in our brief. 

They will increase the guidelines within the guidelines

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. Is it -­

MR. PARRISH: They have it as a bar, a

that the courts are not supposed to use that as only one 

factor. You're supposed to look at all of the rest of 

the factors. And, as a matter of fact, the -­

like a lot of these other issues are based on that they 

create as policy matters. But, under Kimbrough, you 

said policy matters are only one consideration; you 

must, in fact, look at all the other factors.

 You also said it in Rita, too. You're not 

bound by just one of the factors. The court has to look 

at everything in order to be able to make a decision to 

be consistent with all of the other decisions that 

you've written in this area.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose that Mr. Pepper had 

an identical twin, and suppose that Mr. Pepper and his 

twin engaged in the same criminal conduct. They're 

charged with the same offenses; they're tried together; 

they're convicted of exactly the same offenses; they're 

sentenced on the same day.

 Between sentencing and the time of the 

appeal, they -- they rehabilitate themselves in exactly 

the same way. The twin's sentence is affirmed on 

appeal, and Pepper's sentence is overturned and he is -­

he gets a remand for a new sentence.

 Why is it justified for Mr. Pepper to get 

credit for post-sentencing rehabilitation, but his twin 

does not?

 MR. PARRISH: Well, in that instance, the 

question is the guidelines accept the fact of some

disparity, and there's what's called "warranted 

disparity." Mr. Pepper did exactly everything that we 

want a person convicted of a crime to do. He exceeded 

it. And in that instance, if his case comes back down, 

it doesn't fall on any concept of unwarranted disparity. 

There is a difference. There's a difference with every 

individual who faces -­

JUSTICE ALITO: His twin -- his twin did 

everything that was expected of him, too, but he doesn't 

get any credit for the rehabilitation. He just gets 

good time credit for good conduct while he's 

incarcerated.

 MR. PARRISH: But our guidelines and our 

laws make situations where people who are unique and 

who, in fact, exceed don't fall into a separate category 

of being unwarranted disparity.

 The -- the emphasis is on "unwarranted." 

There is some disparity, and if a person is unique and 

that person does, in fact, under 3353 factors, meet all 

of the things that require us to look at a person as an 

individual, that's what we want in our society. And 

that's what your cases -- 3553, 3661 -- that's what they 

indicate. You look at the person as an individual.

 And, true enough, some disparity will be 

there, but it's a warranted disparity. And it's

something that the court can look at, along with all of 

the other factors.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's -- it's 

warranted that the one get the benefit, and it's 

unwarranted that the other does not. I mean, the 

departure in the case of the one who gets 

reconsideration is warranted, but that doesn't mean that 

the disparity is warranted.

 MR. PARRISH: Well, it would be on a 

variance and, as you know, under the Gall decision, 

Chief Justice Roberts, you can look at all of the other 

factors. Under the departure theory, it's a little bit 

different. They're little bit narrower, given it's more 

restrictive, and there's other factors that come into 

play.

 Under the variance theory, you have to look 

at the entire individual. So if that individual can 

demonstrate that they have made improvements -- not just 

gone to drug classes but completed them successfully; 

not just worked as an employee but also excelled and got 

on a management track after conviction; not just went to 

college but got on the dean's list and made straight A's 

-- those are the factors that we want these individuals 

to have.

 And that's why 3553(a) allows us that

latitude, and 3661, which has a long history based upon 

no limitation being placed upon the district court 

judge -- these are the things we want these people to 

have.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there a guideline that 

says that there cannot be a departure for rehabilitation 

after an initial sentencing that's set aside?

 MR. PARRISH: It's not a guideline. There's 

a policy out of the Eighth Circuit -­

JUSTICE BREYER: No. So there's no 

guideline. So as far as the answer to Justice 

Ginsburg -- what I thought was her question, that is -­

the guidelines initially said that the Commission has 

the power to limit departures -­

MR. PARRISH: That's right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- but it doesn't do it, 

except for race and gender -­

MR. PARRISH: And age and factors like -­

that's absolutely right, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and age. That's right. 

So under the guidelines, a judge can depart for any 

reason except those few forbidden things, which I think 

are properly forbidden.

out of whole cloth following the Sims case. It was a 

policy that was actually adopted by the guidelines in 

the year 2000. Prior to that, there were about eight 

circuits that allowed post-sentencing rehabilitation. 

Now, even under the new analysis, there are about six 

circuits that allow it.

please the Court:

 There is no valid basis to categorically bar 

variances under the -- variances from the guidelines 

based on post-sentencing rehabilitation. That's true 

for four primary reasons.

 First, it's undisputed that post-sentencing 

rehabilitation is logically irrelevant to statutory 

sentencing factors in 3553(a), including the need for 

deterrents and the need to protect the safety of the 

community.

 Second, the guidelines themselves authorize 

consideration of presentencing rehabilitation to a 

limited extent, because it's permissible under the 

guidelines to consider presentencing rehabilitation in 

selecting a sentence with inside the guideline range.

 What the guidelines do prohibit, and there 

is a provision in the guidelines that does prohibit, 

the -- a departure from the guidelines based on 

post-sentencing rehabilitation. The guidelines prohibit 

that, but the judgment of the Commission about how much 

weight that factor can be given after Booker in an 

advisory guideline regime is advisory rather than 

mandatory.

 Third -­

What guideline prohibits that?

 MR. McLEESE: 5K2.19.

 And, third, contrary to the suggestion of 

amicus, there is no general principle in our law that at 

a resentencing, new information may not be considered. 

To the contrary, the consistent assumption of the law is 

that at a resentencing, you take the defendant as you 

find him as of the time of resentencing. That's clear 

from this Court's decisions in Pearce and in Wasman. 

It's clear from the large body of cases from the lower 

courts cited in Petitioner's brief at pages 42 through 

44. That's the way the guidelines operate. So there is 

no general principle that you cannot consider new 

information.

 Now, it's true, as Justice Alito's question 

suggested earlier, that that can result in differences 

of opportunity, where one defendant will have an 

opportunity for a resentence and new information will be 

considered as to that defendant; a similarly situated 

defendant will not get a resentencing.

 But that opportunity is sometimes referred 

to as "luck." First, it can be good luck or bad luck. 

And to take the example Justice Alito gave of two twins, 

if you have an example of two defendants who are twins 

who are each convicted of an offense -- let's say

burglary -- and they are given very lenient sentences, 

and because the judge looks at their record at the time 

and determines that they are sympathetic. They are 

don't have a prior criminal record.

 One of them's conviction, you know, has no 

claims of legal error relative to his conviction; he 

gets no resentencing. The other gets a resentencing. 

By the time of resentencing, it has become clear that 

that defendant had previously committed several murders, 

and he has, you know, murdered -- has also committed a 

subsequent murder.

 There is no question that, at that 

resentencing, that information would be considered. 

There is no question there would be a disparity, and it 

would be true even if, let's say, those earlier murders 

had been committed by both of the twins together.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't there a 

difference between evidence that -- evidence of conduct 

that occurred prior to the initial sentencing but wasn't 

known at the time of the initial sentencing, and 

evidence of conduct that occurs between the initial 

sentencing and the resentencing?

 MR. McLEESE: There could be, but, again -­

maybe going too far with the example of the two twins, 

if the two twins, while they were serving -- let's say

they got lenient sentences but not probation. While 

they were serving in jail together, they murdered a 

correctional officer. If one of the defendants does not 

get a resentencing, if one of those twins does not, 

there will be no opportunity for that to be taken into 

account.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And what's your -­

MR. MCLEESE: With respect to the other who 

gets a resentencing -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Maybe it's all or nothing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Maybe it works both ways, 

that the defendant doesn't get the credit for good 

conduct between sentencing and resentencing but also 

doesn't get punished at resentencing for unproven 

conduct that occurs between the first sentence and the 

next -- and the second sentence.

 MR. McLEESE: That's a possible rule of law, 

but my point was that's not the rule of law we've ever 

had. That's not the -- and I should say, nor is it the 

rule of law that's created by 3742(g)(2), because 

3742(g)(2) is not a rule about consideration of new 

evidence. It's an anti-departure provision. It permits 

consideration of new evidence, and it permits these 

kinds of -- if you -- disparities, whether warranted or

not, because it permits consideration of new evidence in 

determining the guidelines range, new evidence about 

loss amounts or -- or whatever. It permits 

consideration of new evidence as it might relate to 

upward adjustments or downward adjustments, as it might 

relate to criminal history. What it forbids is new 

variances or departures.

 So 3742(g)(2) does not implement some 

general policy with respect to new evidence, nor, should 

I say, to the guidelines, because as I said, the 

guidelines permit consideration of post-sentence 

rehabilitation in setting a guideline range. They 

reflect a judgment not about the disparities always 

trumping other considerations, including accuracy in 

sentencing, but only how much weight that those 

disparities -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Was that your fourth point? 

I'm all on pins and needles waiting for your fourth 

point.

 MR. McLEESE: No. Apologies. The fourth 

point is simply that 3742(g)(2), if valid, would 

foreclose consideration of post-sentencing 

rehabilitation, but after Booker it is not valid, and -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If Congress reenacted 

3742(g)(2) tomorrow, would it be valid?

MR. McLEESE: It would be invalid. It would 

be invalid because it would be -- as applied in certain 

circumstances, it would unconstitutionally constrain the 

authority of judges at resentencings -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Why?

 MR. McLEESE: -- and also be inconsistent 

with Booker.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Because the -- look, 

the -- that is not this case. This case, they never had 

a chance to consider whether Booker applies or not, so 

this is, I think, a special case.

 But think of 3742(g) in general. It's 

pretty easy to read that section as applied to instances 

where a judge, the initial sentencing judge, has decided 

on his own volition to apply the guidelines rather than 

not to apply them.

 Now, in such a case, he sentences the 

individual. There's then an appeal, and the appeal he's 

reversed on. What in the Constitution says there has to 

be a second chance to decide whether the guidelines or 

something else should apply? What in Apprendi says 

that? What in any of these cases says that?

 This is an Apprendi problem. As you know, 

I've dissented throughout; I think this is bad policy, 

but -- I've disagreed with everything, but forget that

fact, important though it is.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: But the -- the thing that's 

worrying me about -- and I don't think -- I agree with 

you on policy, but what I'm -- what I'm having trouble 

with is: Is it better under the law to say yes, we can 

interpret 3742(g) so it can be constitutional, and then 

if in some cases it violates Apprendi, let the court say 

that in this case it violates Apprendi.

 But it just isn't clear to me, which is why 

I left it alone the first time. It's not clear. So -­

so -- as to when it is, when it isn't constitutional.

 You got my whole question there?

 MR. McLEESE: I do, and to take it -­

JUSTICE BREYER: And I'd appreciate as much 

answer as you can give me.

 MR. McLEESE: To take an example that's in 

the briefs, if at an original sentencing a judge 

determines the guideline range and ends up calculating 

it to be relatively low -- 57 to 73 months, which 

probably aren't even exact numbers -- and determines 

that that's an appropriate sentence, and although the 

defendant is urging various factors as a basis for 

downward -- for variance from the guidelines, the judge 

determines that there is no reason to vary because this

is a sentence that seems reasonable.

 So that, although those reasons might well 

be persuasive in some contexts, they aren't given the 

range down. The government takes an appeal and argues 

to the court of appeals: In fact, the judge was wrong; 

the guideline range is much higher. And so on remand at 

the resentencing, the judge makes some factual 

determinations, not found by the jury or admitted by the 

defendant, which increase the guideline range under the 

new advice from the court of appeals to a guideline 

range of 121 to 151 months. And -­

JUSTICE BREYER: You think that violates 

Apprendi?

 MR. McLEESE: Well, if the judge then says: 

I would like to vary from the guidelines; I am locked in 

under the guidelines to a 121-month sentence, and I 

have -- I didn't -- it's true I didn't vary before on 

these grounds, but that's because the sentence didn't -­

didn't warrant -- because of its relative lack of 

severity, did not warrant a variance, I think that 

the -- the logic of Apprendi and Booker would foreclose 

constraining resentencings in that way.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I'm -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Yes.

 MR. MCLEESE: I think that's an answer to 

the question that you had asked earlier, which is, I 

think, if Congress enacted a statute which categorically 

said that whatever happens at the original sentencing, 

the judge has to list any reason that the judge is 

relying on for a downward variance or departure, and 

then cabins the judge on remand, that in certain 

contexts that would be inconsistent with this Court's 

line of cases from Apprendi through Booker.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, under 3553(c), the 

court is supposed to explain the reasons for the 

sentence, even if it's within the guidelines; isn't that 

right?

 MR. McLEESE: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And so if the court is 

deciding whether the sentence should be 57 months or 

63 months, whatever the figures were that you gave, and 

the court thinks that some factor -- let's say age -- is 

significant, the court should say: I'm sentencing the 

defendant to 57 as opposed to 63 because of the 

defendant's advanced age or young age or whatever it is.

 Now, on appeal, the -- the court of appeals 

says the guidelines sentence was improperly calculated; 

it should be -- the real range is 120 to 125 months.

Remand. Now if the court wants to grant a departure or 

a variance based on age, the court has mentioned age 

previously as a relevant factor, and it can do that. 

But if age wasn't -- if age was not relevant to the 

determination of where within the guidelines this 

sentence should be set, why is it -- why does the 

Constitution require that age be a relevant factor, a 

factor that's open to the judge on resentencing?

 MR. McLEESE: Well -­

JUSTICE ALITO: It's just a notice 

provision. It's not -- it's not something that 

substantively limits what the court can do.

 MR. McLEESE: To clarify, a judge is 

required to state in open court orally the reasons for a 

sentence inside the guideline range, only if the range 

is sufficiently large, and the written statement of 

reasons is not -- the reasons for selecting a sentence 

within the guideline range are not required to be in the 

written statements of reasons. The written statement of 

reasons relates only to grounds outside the -- the 

guidelines. And to -- from a practical perspective, it 

would be extremely difficult to expect sentencing judges 

to list every conditionally or contingently relevant 

fact, depending on whatever sentence ultimately comes 

back on remand, that might be relevant to a reason to

depart from a range that the judge is not contemplating 

at the time of the sentencing.

 But I should say also that it -- the answer 

to this question, of whether Congress could reenact 

3742(g)(2) after Booker, and it would be constitutional 

or not constitutional as applied in certain settings, is 

not essential to our point, because the appeal 

provisions that were excised in Booker were not 

determined by the Court -- they were not excised because 

the Court determined they would be independently 

unconstitutional.

 The -- the remedial component of the Booker 

opinion was focused on the question of, having found a 

constitutional violation, what then do we do to remedy 

it? And what the Court said was the way we will remedy 

this is that we will make the guidelines advisory rather 

than mandatory.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The answer to this case is, 

I don't think, too hard. You say it's at least 

questionable enough, 42(g) you could say, at least 

questionable enough that it's the same box as the ones 

that were excised.

judge has never made.

 MR. McLEESE: Yes, and to elaborate on 

that -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right?

 MR. McLEESE: Just -- just by its terms, 

section 3742(g)(2) is inconsistent with the remedial 

rule announced in Booker, which was that the guidelines 

would be advisory rather than mandatory -­

JUSTICE BREYER: They didn't say -- forget 

that argument. What I was about -­

MR. McLEESE: But more specifically -­

JUSTICE BREYER: I do have another point I'd 

like to get out, as long as I have this opportunity. It 

seems to me there's a considerable confusion, perhaps, 

only from my point of view, but this word "variance" --

I mean, why is it felt necessary to use the word 

"variance"? If it's true -- and it's not totally true, 

but if it's true the judge -- you can apply the 

guideline, apply it. Now, the guidelines themselves 

gives you the right to depart in every single case but, 

for example, a handful of factors such as race, where 

you really shouldn't change the thing just because of 

race. So what is the need for the variance?

Now, maybe this 5K9-point whatever that 

is -- maybe there are a handful where there is a need, 

and maybe this is an example of it. But are there a 

lot, many, what -- can you just talk a little bit about 

it?

 MR. McLEESE: It's -- two points with 

respect to that, one of which is this is a provision 

where the -- the Commission has specifically said it is 

not lawful to depart on this basis, though it is 

permissible, again, to sentence within the range -­

JUSTICE BREYER: It's just a policy 

statement. Does it enjoy the same status of law?

 MR. McLEESE: Correct. Yes, they are 

treated -- in the era when the guidelines were treated 

as mandatory, they were treated as binding in their 

turn. There are other guidelines provisions about 

departures which either foreclose other bases or which 

will say they are not usually or ordinarily a basis for 

departure.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I get it.

 MR. McLEESE: And so, there still is 

litigation in a post-mandatory guideline system about 

whether it's a correct application of the guidelines to 

depart on this basis.

before your time is up, you'd like to address the first 

question.

 MR. McLEESE: Yes. With respect to the law 

of the case issue, as it has been framed by the -­

the -- the briefs by Petitioner on the merits in this 

Court, it is an extremely narrow issue; and that is, 

taking as a given that the Eighth Circuit had authority 

to order de novo resentencing and that, in fact, it did 

order de novo resentencing, was, at that resentencing, 

the district court -- the resentencing district court 

judge bound by the earlier judge's discretionary 

determination that the substantial assistance provided 

by defendant Pepper justified a 40 percent reduction? 

And to ask that question is almost to answer it in the 

sense that the phrase "de novo" means anew or afresh. 

And the point -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it has 

nothing -- but what if the appeal had nothing to do with 

the issue at all? I'm thinking in -- the analogy in the 

civil context, so you have two totally unrelated issues. 

If you appeal issue B and that's what the fight is 

about, and you reverse and send it back, it would at 

least be unusual for judge to say, oh, and by the way, 

I'm coming out the other way on issue A.

setting. Courts have taken the view that sentencing is 

different because sentencing is a relatively discrete 

proceeding where there are a number of interconnected 

determinations, a lot of them discretionary based on the 

judge's assessment, a lot of them conditionally relevant 

to each other.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But these are not 

interconnected, are they?

 MR. McLEESE: Well, the amount of 

substantial assistance that is given in a particular 

case can easily be interconnected to antecedent 

determinations, including what the guidelines level is, 

because judges are often -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, my point is that 

the level of assistance is not in any way connected to 

the post-sentencing conduct.

 MR. McLEESE: No, these two issues are not 

interrelated, but I'm explaining the reason for the 

doctrine in the -- in the sentencing setting. The 

greater willingness of courts of appeals to order de 

novo resentencing and say even though the particular 

issue on appeal doesn't directly open up the other 

issues that may have been determined at sentencing, 

judges in the -- courts of appeals in the sentencing 

context all agree they have authority to order de novo

resentencing where they think it's appropriate. And 

they tend to think it's more appropriate in the 

sentencing context than generally, because, as I said -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but why -- why 

does that matter when you're talking about two totally 

unrelated issues?

 MR. McLEESE: Because also -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no reason to 

suppose that the court of appeals thinks there ought to 

be -- or any issue with respect to the question A when 

they focus solely on question B.

 MR. McLEESE: I agree. But, again, when the 

court of appeals orders de novo resentencing, that 

doesn't open up only substantial assistance. The point 

is the judge is going to go through and make, as of the 

time of the resentencing, determinations on the 

situation as it exists at that time. So, it is possible 

and not at all unusual that issues that were not up in 

the court of appeals will come up on resentencing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you're worried 

about the general rule, but you agree that none of those 

arguments make any sense in this case.

 MR. McLEESE: I -- I agree that it would 

have been permissible for the court of appeals here to 

choose not direct a de novo resentencing. That would

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would not 

interfere with the new judge's or the judge's discretion 

across the board?

 MR. McLEESE: I -- I -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I have never had to 

sentence someone, but it seems to me, particularly when 

you have a change in the judges, there's a very personal 

investment in what you do with the -- the defendant, and 

to say that, well, another judge looked at this factor 

so your hands are tied in that respect is -- is a 

questionable result.

 MR. McLEESE: I agree. And I should say 

that the issues that we're discussing are interesting 

ones, but they are not in the law of the case issue 

that's being presented here, because, in fact, the 

Eighth Circuit did order de novo resentencing. The 

defendant has never challenged the validity of their 

ordering de novo resentencing. So the only issue is, 

what does it mean for the law of the case doctrine when 

de novo resentencing is ordered?

 And on that question, it's very clear. In 

fact, not just the Eighth Circuit but every court of 

appeals that we're aware of to resolve that question has

said that, as the name suggests, when the circuit 

chooses, for whatever reasons, to order de novo 

resentencing, the -- the judge at the resentencing is 

not bound by earlier determinations of the district 

court judge. And -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there reason to 

suppose when they say de novo resentencing, they're 

talking about the mistake that was made with respect to 

issue B and not issue A?

 MR. McLEESE: No, there's no reason to 

suppose that. But what there is reason to suppose -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do they -- is it 

their practice in some cases to say we're sending this 

back for de novo sentencing but only with respect to the 

issue that we addressed? Or do they just normally throw 

it out and say start over, without any supposition that 

the district court would take a look again at something 

that wasn't before the court of appeals at all?

 MR. McLEESE: Different circuits approach 

that somewhat differently, but all circuits have -­

understand that they have authority to make 

individualized case determinations and they do. There 

are cases where -­

we're sending this back for resentencing but only on the 

issue that we addressed on appeal?

 MR. McLEESE: Yes. And the Eighth Circuit's 

opinions make clear that -- although they apply sort of 

a default presumption that there will be de novo 

resentencing, they make clear that they have authority 

to order limited resentencings. And they do that where 

in a particular case they think that's more efficient or 

more appropriate.

 They explained in this case, by the way, 

with respect to the suggestion you made earlier, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that part of the reason they thought 

de novo resentencing was appropriate here is because 

they were reassigning the matter to a different judge, 

and, therefore, I think for some of the reasons that you 

were suggesting, they felt de novo review was 

appropriate.

 But, again, on the narrow law of the case 

issue that is presented, there is no disagreement among 

the courts of appeals, and as the name suggests, if 

there is a de novo resentencing, the matter is de novo.

 If I could, for just a moment, turn back to 

the post-sentence rehabilitation issue to make one last 

point, which is, going one level deeper into the Booker 

remedy analysis, again, even if there were some -­

 MR. McLEESE: All I was going to say is that 

in excising the appeal provisions that were excised in 

Booker, the Court identified four reasons why those 

should be excised, and each one of them applies equally 

or more so with respect to the provision at issue here.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM G. CIONGOLI

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW

 MR. CIONGOLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Congress enacted 3742(g) for the purpose of 

stopping district courts from evading the mandate of the 

court of appeals on remanded sentencing cases by relying 

on grounds that they did not consider at the original 

sentencing.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And as far as you're 

concerned, Justice Alito's question about post- -­

post-sentencing criminal conduct couldn't be considered 

by a court, either?

factor mentioned in the original sentence, so you would 

apply the rule equally to -­

MR. CIONGOLI: I -- I would, Justice 

Sotomayor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any logic to 

that? I mean, I know that when I was a district court 

judge, routinely post-sentencing criminal conduct would 

make me wonder whether this person really was worthy of 

a lower sentence or not, or of whatever largesse I may 

have given him or her in original sentence. What makes 

sense about that?

 MR. CIONGOLI: Well, I think one thing that 

would make sense of it is there's a different mechanism. 

There's an opportunity for that to be reflected in a -­

in a separate criminal prosecution and a -- and a 

sentencing for that conduct. When -- when the 

sentencing guidelines were created and when 3742(g) was 

passed, all of this was done against the backdrop of a 

sense that the sentencing guidelines were to focus on 

avoiding unwarranted disparities, but as the Court 

observed in Booker, sentencing -- similar -- similar 

sentences for similar crimes conducted in similar ways.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- when this provision 

was passed, Congress was worried, I thought, about the 

situations where district court judges' hands -- were on

appeal told you can't use this ground for departure, and 

often the court, because they thought the original 

sentence they gave was fair, would then articulate 

another ground for departure that they hadn't earlier. 

But didn't all of that go out of the window with Booker? 

I mean, the presumption in -- that drove Congress was 

that the guidelines were mandatory. Once Booker said 

they weren't, why should we be limiting Congress -- a 

judge's discretion ab initio or post hoc to giving what 

they believe is a reasonable sentence?

 MR. CIONGOLI: Justice Sotomayor, I think 

that the purpose of 3742(g) is to limit the ability of a 

district court to evade the mandate on remand in 

sentencing. And I think that purpose was valid before 

Booker; I think it's actually even more important after 

Booker if you're going, for example, to have meaningful 

opportunities for the government to appeal. If a 

district court can impose a sentence that the court of 

appeals then finds substantively unreasonable, and -­

and on remand the district court can then consider 

grounds that didn't exist at the time of the original 

sentencing and, in fact, couldn't have been considered 

by the court of appeals because the evidence didn't 

exist at the time the court of appeals reviewed it and 

is, in this case, uniquely in the hands of the defendant

to create, then you're going to create essentially a 

procedural merry-go-round where a district court will 

impose a 24-month sentence, the government will appeal, 

the court of appeals will think that's substantively 

unreasonable. It will be remanded to the district court 

who will say: Well, in the interim this person has 

rehabilitated them self, they've gotten a job and 

they've gone to school. The government -- imposing 

another 24-month sentence. These are not related to the 

facts of the case, but this is a different hypothetical.

 The government will then appeal again and 

say: This is ridiculous. The underlying conduct is 

extremely severe; 24 months is substantively 

unreasonable. And they'll appeal to the court of 

appeals.

 The court of appeals will say: We agree 

it's substantively unreasonable; we're going to remand 

for resentencing.

 And the district court will say: Well, not 

only has he gone to school and not only does he have a 

job, but he's gotten married, and he has been promoted, 

and he has been named employee of the year. So I'm 

imposing a 24-month sentence again.

 And at some point, the district -- the 

government is going to say: I give up, because I could

keep appealing, but what's the point? It appears -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but there are two 

explanations for your hypothetical. One is there has 

been a real change that affects the judge.

 The other is where you -- where you began, I 

thought you were going, where the judge is evading the 

court of appeals. Those are two different things. I 

mean, one may happen, and one may not.

 MR. CIONGOLI: That -- that's right, 

Justice Kennedy, and I think that both purposes are 

served by 3742(g). 3742(g), as both Petitioner and the 

Government -- serves a constitutional purpose. What 

both the Petitioner and the Government object to is the 

way that it's drafted. It's not that Congress, they 

say, couldn't pass this, but that they couldn't pass it 

the way that it's passed because it makes essentially 

illegal references to the mandatory sentencing 

guidelines. That is a product of the fact that this 

statute was drafted before Booker and didn't have the 

benefit of knowing how Booker was going to come out.

 What the Court, I think, needs to decide is, 

post-Booker, how it's going to deal with statutes like 

3742(g) -- and there are others -- which stand for an 

entirely constitutional and important purpose but which 

necessarily, because of the time they were drafted, have

references to or language that assumes the existence of 

a mandatory guidelines scheme.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many of those 

statutes are left that we -- that the Court hasn't 

looked at?

 MR. CIONGOLI: Well, I can think of at least 

three problems that would -- that would result from the 

Court saying that any reference to a mandatory 

guidelines scheme creates -- creates essentially a 

facial invalidity if it's incapable of constitutional 

review and -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Which are the three?

 MR. CIONGOLI: Well, first of all, 3553(a) 

makes two references to -- to 3742(g). And so there's a 

question as how you would apply those if you strike 

3742(g). I think that 3553(c), to the extent that it 

requires a written statement in the context of a 

departure, starts to -- starts to raise questions. And 

as Justice Scalia pointed out in his dissent in Booker 

itself, there's a real question as to whether 3742(f) 

has any reason to exist after Booker.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But all those -- what you'd 

tend to do is take the parts that refer to the other 

statute and say they don't do anything. And does that 

ruin the provision it's in? The answer, I think,

normally ws no, it doesn't ruin it at all. It makes 

sense.

 But this one is a tough one. I grant you 

that this one is a tough one. And my problem of course 

is I can think of a constitutional way of applying this, 

but it's a little far-fetched. And the far-fetched one 

makes me think that it's unconstitutional in the 

far-fetched nature of it, and I don't think it has a 

spillover.

 MR. CIONGOLI: But, Justice Breyer, I -­

JUSTICE BREYER: You see, the far-fetched 

one was the one that was brought out. I mean, not 

far-fetched. To -- to say in those circumstances that 

it is constitutional, where they're going to apply a new 

guideline and they don't have the evidence -- as much as 

I dissented in Apprendi, I think that one probably does 

violate Apprendi.

 MR. CIONGOLI: Justice -­

JUSTICE BREYER: And I think I have to stick 

up for that, don't I?

 MR. CIONGOLI: Well, Justice Breyer, if 

you're referring to the Solicitor General's hypothetical 

of a case in which they miscalculate the guidelines and 

they don't announce their reasons otherwise, I actually 

think that there's a way to avoid the problem in that,

depending on whether the case arises before or after 

this case. If it arises after this case, I think it 

will be very clear to district courts that they need to 

be very careful and thorough in articulating their 

reasons for reaching the sentence, which, particularly 

in a post-Booker world, I think is a good thing. If 

there's -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Would that -- I mean -­

the court didn't sufficiently articulate its reasons.

court. I mean, dramatically.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You think that's a good 

thing to do?

 MR. CIONGOLI: I -- I think having a 

district court articulate its reasons is a good thing. 

They are supposed to do that under -- under 

congressional statute now, 3553(c). They're supposed to 

do it in open court very clearly, and in certain 

circumstances, they're supposed to do it -- they're 

supposed to do it in writing.

can check a box and the -- unless they're going to

deal with later, but the part that's confusing me is 

where this word "variance" comes into, because I think 

the word "departure" would normally -- normally -- cover 

the matter. And then when it gets to the court of 

appeals, the court of appeals, whether they're inside 

the guideline or outside the guideline and have 

departed, reviews the matter for -- you know, inside and 

have departed or outside, those situations. It says in 

Booker the standard is to review for reasonableness. 

But where does this variance business come in?

 MR. CIONGOLI: Well, I think in the context 

of 3742(g), that's one of the -- the linguistic vestiges 

of the guidelines, which is that, up until Irizarry, the 

Court itself used the terms "variance" and "departure" 

interchangeably because a variance didn't exist prior to 

Booker.

 I don't -- the Court obviously spoke to the 

question of whether or not it was going to equate a 

variance and a departure in the context of rule 32(h) in 

Irizarry. I don't think actually that that distinction 

was essential to the holding in Irizarry, and I think 

could be limited there. I think, particularly where the 

court is trying to avoid invalidating a duly enacted 

statute, some flexibility in terms of interpreting 

departure in 3742(g)(2)(B) would be warranted, and you

would essentially say that to the extent that a court is 

varying or departing, that they would need to articulate 

the reasons.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's true that -- that in 

all of the briefing in Booker, 3742(g) was not mentioned 

by any party.

 MR. CIONGOLI: That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it wasn't a question 

of the Court overlooking it. The Court didn't say 

anything one way or the other about it because it wasn't 

presented as one of the statutes that would have to be 

overruled.

 MR. CIONGOLI: Justice Ginsburg, I think 

that obviously the Court is dealing very clearly with 

the constitutionality of it now. And I think that 

Congress had very good reasons for enacting it that 

continue to be valid. It's capable of constitutional 

application, I think, in the mine run of cases and, in 

particular, in this case. There's no Sixth Amendment 

allegation in this case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But the problem, to be very 

specific, is I think the following: The first 

sentencing, the judge applies the guideline. He says: 

There was $300,000 stolen from the bank. I look it up

over here and I get sentence X. On appeal, the 

appellate court says: You should have counted the 

securities as money taken. So it's 1,300,000. So go 

and apply guideline Y. He goes back, looks at Y -- it's 

a very high number -- and thinks: Given certain 

circumstances which make this case unusual, I want to 

depart downward.

 Now, I would have thought that the judge's 

behavior in that second instance would have violated 

Apprendi, because that judge was either going to 

sentence even without the departure on the basis of his 

having taken some securities worth a million dollars 

which was not a fact that went to the jury. So there it 

is. Or he'd have to throw aside the guideline.

 But this statute says you can't throw aside 

the guidelines, and you can't depart for a reason that 

wasn't previously given. So this statute is -- is 

forcing him to sentence on the basis of a fact that was 

not found by a jury. I think that's the argument for 

saying it violates Apprendi. And I -- I don't see why 

it doesn't.

 MR. CIONGOLI: Justice Breyer, I -- I think 

that in -- in certain applications of this statute, 

there will be problems. I -- I think that's 

unavoidable, and I think it's an unavoidable consequence

of having been drafted before Booker. The question is 

how the Court is going to address that. Is the Court 

going to read the statute flexibly? Is -- is it going 

to interpret it in a way that tries to avoid those 

circumstances, those constitutional problems? Or does 

it ultimately determine that it's -- it's essentially 

not capable of a saving construction.

 I think it is capable of a saving 

construction; I think it's capable of a saving 

construction in a couple of ways that avoid most of the 

problems that have been articulated by -- by both 

Petitioner and the Government.

 The first, which actually Petitioner points 

out in his reply brief, is in 3742(g) itself. There's 

this language about "except that," that appears to limit 

the -- the ability of the district court to actually 

follow the mandate of the court of appeals.

 I don't think that that can be read to limit 

the mandate of the court of appeals, nor do I think that 

anyone is suggesting that 3742(g) changes the rule in 

Harper v. Virginia Department of -- of Taxation, the 

idea that -- that district courts obviously would have 

to give the benefit of intervening changes in -- in law 

in judicial decisions. And so Booker, which has been 

used as an example -- Booker on remand would likely have

been entitled to a -- a resentencing, a resentencing 

based on factors that the district court judge could 

have considered at the time of the original sentencing, 

but now in light of Booker, basically a do-over. And 

for a -- for a small section of cases, I think that 

would work.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How? Would -- would you 

explain, as concisely as you can, why you think that 

(g)(2) would be unconstitutional in -- in some limited 

category of cases, and how that can be avoided by what 

you call a flexible interpretation?

 MR. CIONGOLI: Justice Scalia, I think I 

said it would be problematic; I don't think I conceded 

that it would be unconstitutional.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right.

 MR. CIONGOLI: I -- I think that -- I think 

that there are some -- there are some circumstances 

where, by a strict read of -- of (g)(2), the court would 

be required to apply the guidelines, a guidelines range. 

And the example that -- that the Solicitor General's 

Office gave might be the best, which is where you have a 

circumstance where the district court has imposed a 

sentence within the guidelines range, has not given any 

other reason for a variance, the sentence is at the 

bottom of the range, which may or may not indicate that

they thought that the -- that the sentence should be at 

the low end; and then on a -- on a calculation, there's 

a determination that the -- on appeal, there's a 

determination that the calculation was incorrect; and on 

remand, the district court says: I'm -- I'm bound by 

this new calculation, and I'm giving you a mandatory 

sentence. I'm giving you -- I'm bound by the guidelines 

range because I didn't give any other reasons. I didn't 

give any other reasons under -- under (2)(A), and, 

therefore, I can only give you a guideline sentence.

 And in those cases, the guidelines would be 

mandatory. And, under Booker, I think there's -­

there's a question as to whether a court can -- can 

impose a mandatory sentence in any case after Booker.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but -- I mean, why 

wouldn't you read that simply to have been overcome by 

the holding of Booker, that you apply -- that every 

judge has to apply 3553 factors and decide the ultimate 

sentence on the basis of those factors? I mean, isn't 

that what Booker said? And why wouldn't you apply that 

to -- to (2)(A) and (B) as well?

 MR. CIONGOLI: I -- I certainly think the 

Court could take that approach, and -- and, in fact, I 

think -- I think to the -- I think it should. I think 

that the Court should find a way to read or construe

3742(a) to be constitutional, because it serves an 

important and independent policy choice that has been 

identified by Congress.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But doesn't it conflict 

with 3553(a)(2), that is, the overriding provision that 

a sentence should be sufficient but not greater than 

necessary to deter criminal conduct? And the judge is 

looking at this defendant and says -- a criminal -- to 

deter criminal conduct and protect public against future 

crimes: Well, this person has turned out to be a model 

citizen, and we don't have to keep him in for a longer 

time to protect the public against future crimes. So if 

I were to apply 3742(g)(2), I would give him a sentence 

that is unnecessary to protect the public against future 

crimes.

 MR. CIONGOLI: Justice Ginsburg, I think 

you're pointing out that there is some tension which I 

have admitted. I think that, again, this statute was 

drafted at a time when there was a different set of 

assumptions, and so there -- there may be applications 

which create some difficulty. They create more 

difficulty in terms of how it's applied, but they are 

not the kinds of difficulties that I think are 

insurmountable. And they're certainly not the kinds of 

difficulties that support what I think is -- is a

proposed broad solution by both Petitioner and the 

Government, that post-Booker, sentencing statutes which 

-- which impose a mandatory guideline sentence really in 

any applications are facially unconstitutional.

 I don't -- I don't read Booker that way. 

don't think the Court intended it that way. Certainly, 

the remedial holding in Booker doesn't indicate that. 

If it did -- if that is, in fact, what the remedial 

holding in Booker stands for, I think the -- the 

implications are more far reaching than the Court -- the 

Court intended.

 If there are no further questions -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Parrish, you have 2 minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALFREDO PARRISH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PARRISH: Thank you. I would like to 

first address the law of the case issue, and that -­

initially, I said it was apples and oranges, and it is. 

On two separate occasions after the 5K ruling had been 

made by District Court Judge Bennett, it was appealed 

twice to the Eighth Circuit. After it was appealed 

twice to the Eighth Circuit, they had an abuse of 

discretion standard they could have used to resolve it. 

They did not comment on it. They upheld it.

Then it was sent back down. After it had 

come up on an original writ to this Court, this Court 

vacated the Eighth Circuit opinion, sent that opinion 

back down. But the law of the case, as you said, Mr. 

Chief Justice Roberts, still remained with the district 

court on the initial ruling. The initial ruling that 

Judge Bennett made with regard to the 5K departure was a 

separate ruling.

 Now, the Eighth Circuit, in its own analysis 

of how you interpret its remand -- we disagree with the 

Government. They said they -- you look at the analysis 

of the case to determine the remand. And in that 

instance, we believe that the remand was the analysis of 

the case that the 5K departure remains. No new facts 

came in, no new controlling law came into place, and 

there was no manifest injustice. She heard no new facts 

on this case.

 We believe the Court should reverse -­

vacate the Eighth Circuit court of opinion case 

regarding post-sentencing rehabilitation, remand with 

directions from this Court consistent with an opinion 

that requires the court to impose a sentence that does 

not exceed 24 months.

 And, Justice Ginsburg, we did mention, on 

page 33 of our brief, the 3742(g)(2) as a footnote, when

the case first came up. But the Eighth Circuit, as you 

all know, did not use that rule. They used an old rule 

that was in effect from the Sims case to impose the 

sentence. It was not part of 3742(g)(2) or any other 

statute.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Ciongoli, you have briefed and argued 

this case as an amicus curiae in support of the judgment 

below at the invitation of the Court and have ably 

discharged your responsibility.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the
