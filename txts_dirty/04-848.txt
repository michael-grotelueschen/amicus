[10:04 a.m.] 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

today in Dolan versus United States Postal Service. 

Mr. Radmore. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. RADMORE 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. RADMORE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The Federal Tort Claims Act's postal-matter 

exception bars any claim arising out of the failure of the 

Postal Service to fulfill its duty to deliver mail to its 

intended destination on time and in good condition, but 

does not bar any claim arising out of ordinary negligence 

that happens to occur while the tortfeasor is delivering 

mail. 

The Petitioner's construction shields the 

Government from all claims arising out of loss or damage 

or delay or destruction of the mail, while allowing claims 

that do not stem from all -- do not stem from the 

violation of the unique duty of the Postal Service to make 

sure that the mail arrives on time and in good condition. 

It is the construction most faithful with the text and 

purpose of the Federal Tort Claims Act. The exception 

bars any claims, whether for personal injury or property

damage, that arise while the mail is -- if the mail is 

lost, misdelivered, damaged, or delayed. 

The Government argues for a much broader 

construction that would bar all claims that arise from the 

handling of mail. The Government's construction depends 

on a definition of transmission of the mail, viewed in 

isolation from the rest --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Radmore, what was the 

purpose of the enactment of the waiver of Federal 

sovereign immunity here? Was it to allow recovery for 

auto accidents occurring by postal trucks? 

MR. RADMORE: Well, the --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was that basically the 

purpose? 

MR. RADMORE: Justice O'Connor, this Court's 

decision in Kosak tells us that one of the main purposes 

in enacting the Federal Tort Claims Act was to allow 

private persons to be able to make claims against the 

Postal Service from motor vehicle --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Arising --

MR. RADMORE: -- accidents. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- out of auto accidents. 

MR. RADMORE: Correct. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And do we normally construe 

waivers of sovereign immunity narrowly?

 MR. RADMORE: Well, once you --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I thought we did. 

MR. RADMORE: But once there's a broad waiver --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: For auto accidents. 

MR. RADMORE: Well --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, why should we interpret 

the exception broadly? 

MR. RADMORE: Well, the exception -- this Court 

has told us, in both Smith and Kosak, that it is the --

the lower courts and this Court, when they're viewing an 

exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act -- that they 

shouldn't extend the waiver, nor should they view it more 

narrowly, that they should look at the waiver -- they 

should look at the exception and make a determination as 

to what the meaning of the words are, and what the reason 

for the exception was, and they should do no more, nor no 

less, than that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess we've already 

construed it broadly, haven't we, in -- or, excuse me --

yes, construed the waiver broadly. In Kosak versus United 

States, we allowed a suit against the United States for 

negligence of a mail truck in an automobile accident. I 

suppose the language could have covered that, couldn't it? 

MR. RADMORE: Well, that's exactly what the 

point -- that our point is, is that, because the

Government, in this case in -- and the Court, in Kosak, 

has told us that automobile accidents are not barred, are 

-- from -- by -- they're not barred --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It could --

MR. RADMORE: -- in the case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- have been within the 

literal. It could have been negligent -- what is it? --

negligence --

MR. RADMORE: Negligent --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- in the delivery of mail? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Negligent --

MR. RADMORE: Negligent --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- transmission. 

MR. RADMORE: -- transmission. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But an automobile accident is 

something, as the Government points out, that any agency 

of Government can be involved in, not peculiar to the 

Postal Service. But the transmission of the letter is --

the words are "negligent transmission." Many people think 

of the Postal Service, the letter carrier, delivering the 

mail to one's home. That act surely fits the word 

"negligent transmission." 

MR. RADMORE: Justice Ginsburg, in isolation, we 

admit that the word "transmission" could have the broad

interpretation that the Government as -- is urging this 

Court to follow. But you have to look at the term 

"negligent transmission" in the context of the whole 

exception. And if "negligent transmission" were to be 

given the broad interpretation that the Government urges 

and the Third Circuit found, then the words "loss" and 

"miscarriage" in the exception would be superfluous. And 

we also know that this Court, on prior occasions, has 

indicated that the canon that "words are known by their 

associate" applies in construing exceptions to the Federal 

Tort Claims Act. And in -- that canon tells us that when 

you have words that are in a group, they should be given 

like meaning. And we know that only mail can be lost, 

only mail can be delivered to the wrong location. And, as 

a result, it's pretty clear that the term "negligent 

transmission" deals with the mail, itself. And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How -- wait, I -- it's 

not true that only mail can be lost, or only mail can be 

delivered to the wrong location. If you order from a 

private delivery service, they can do all of those things, 

as well. 

MR. RADMORE: Well, they can do all those 

things, but they don't have the benefit of the -- of 

sovereign immunity. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you consider

covered by negligent transmission? I take it if the -- if 

the postal worker throws the package to the house and 

there's something in it that gets broken, that's covered 

by the exception? 

MR. RADMORE: Any damage to the mail, itself, 

would be covered to the exception -- by the exception. 

For instance, if a -- if somebody had ordered their 

medication over the -- you know, through the Medicare Act, 

and they had ordered it from a warehouse somewhere in 

Idaho, and the -- during the transmission of the mail, the 

medication had been lost, well, if somebody was injured, 

if they had a stroke or they had a heart attack because 

they didn't get their mail on time --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. But if -- now, 

if they throw the package onto the porch, and it lands in 

a place where somebody's going to trip over it, you say 

that's not covered by the exception. 

MR. RADMORE: That's not covered, because that's 

an act of ordinary negligence. Damage to the package 

would always be covered, but the act of creating a 

hazardous condition would not be covered, because that's 

an ordinary tort that would be -- subject private persons 

to a liability between themselves. And that's -- the 

purpose of the Federal Tort Claims Act is to allow the 

Government to be held responsible for ordinary torts if

there would be a like liability between private persons. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Wouldn't the term "negligent 

transmission" probably cover late deliveries? 

MR. RADMORE: It would cover late deliveries. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Or incorrect deliveries in --

MR. RADMORE: It would -- could. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- to the wrong address, 

something like that. 

MR. RADMORE: Delay or damage --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

MR. RADMORE: -- to the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It could cover, under your 

theory, this very act, just dumping the stuff there on the 

porch, if the consequence of that had not been that the 

homeowner tripped over it, but that rain destroyed the 

contents of the -- of the letters so that they were 

illegible. 

MR. RADMORE: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You would --

MR. RADMORE: I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- say that that would --

MR. RADMORE: Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- be covered. 

MR. RADMORE: -- Scalia, that's correct, that 

the exception would bar suit against the Government for

any damage to the actual contents of the package, itself. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, in -- it seems to me a 

little strange that this same act is both within the 

exception and not within the exception, the same act of 

negligence. 

MR. RADMORE: Well, it's not really the same 

act. It's the same act, in that they used the mail, and 

there was a consequence to the mail, but the creation of a 

hazard or -- through some kind of careless act, whether it 

be the postal employee or whether it be a person that 

would raise 2680(c) from the customs exception, whether --

or an IRS agent or a private person --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it --

MR. RADMORE: -- would all be responsible for 

creating a hazardous condition on the porch. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't your response to 

Justice Scalia -- you could make the same argument. If 

there's an accident, and the truck caught on fire, and the 

mail was destroyed, you couldn't recover for the lost mail 

in the truck, but you could -- but you could recover for 

personal injury resulting from the accident. It would be 

precisely the same conduct. 

MR. RADMORE: Precisely the same under our 

interpretation of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That is a good answer. I'm

[Laughter.] 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What does "negligent 

transmission" add to "loss" or "miscarriage"? 

MR. RADMORE: Well, the -- "loss" doesn't cover 

mail that would be delayed or damaged. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I supposed 

"miscarriage" does. 

MR. RADMORE: "Miscarriage" would be mail that 

went to the wrong location. If it was misdelivered, 

that's what "miscarriage" would mean in this context. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or mis-carried, like 

handled in a way that it's damaged, or put in a place 

where it's going to be damaged. It seems to me that --

I'm not sure what additional weight "negligent 

transmission" covers if you have a reasonable reading of 

"miscarriage." 

MR. RADMORE: Well, you could look at every term 

in the exception, and, if you gave it the broadest 

definition possible, you could say that all of the words 

are superfluous, that "loss" would cover mail that was, 

you know, lost and not delivered to the postal patron 

within two weeks, and, for that period of time, the mail 

was lost. But if you look at the exception in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that doesn't work.

I mean, if you deliver it to the house next door, you 

haven't lost it, you've misdelivered it or miscarried it. 

I don't -- I don't think "miscarriage" is redundant. But 

you -- your construction of "negligent transmission" is so 

narrow that I'm not sure it adds anything to 

"miscarriage," which suggests it might --

MR. RADMORE: Well, "miscarriage" doesn't mean 

that the mail was damaged. "Miscarriage," if I take the 

-- if the mail is delivered, Mr. Justice Roberts, to your 

next-door neighbor, it doesn't mean the mail is -- maybe 

miscarriaged, but it's not delayed, and it's not damaged. 

So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about "delay"? 

Does "delay" -- your -- isn't that something that's 

neither within "loss" or "miscarriage"? 

MR. RADMORE: No, "delayed" wouldn't be within 

either term. "Lost," I think, means exactly what it says, 

mail that's lost. "Lost" means lost. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So, if, in fact, they -- the 

Post Office negligently delays the knowledge that would 

come to me in the letter, that I have 15 days to claim my 

billion-dollar inheritance --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- I guess I couldn't sue.

suppose that the -- what they do is, he puts the mail on 

the porch, my package, and he rips it open, negligently; 

and there for everyone to see is the toupee that I 

ordered.

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think --

transmission.

 JUSTICE BREYER: On the other -- no, they --

see, it -- he put it on the porch, which is transmitting 

it, in such a way that it fell open. But I'm just trying 

to think -- and then the -- on the other side of it, you 

have the automobile accident. And I guess he comes along 

the street, the postman, swinging my package around, and 

bops someone on the head with it. I guess that's covered. 

And then, this case is somewhere in the middle. 

MR. RADMORE: Well, obviously, a line has to be 

drawn somewhere. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But what's the principle 

according to which we're drawing it? 

MR. RADMORE: Well, I think anything -- any 

claim that would arise from the unique governmental duty 

to deliver the mail on time and in good condition would be 

barred. Any --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me --

JUSTICE BREYER: But the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I don't understand your last 

-- your last answer. You think bopping somebody on the 

head in the course of delivering a package would --

MR. RADMORE: Oh, no, it wouldn't be barred, 

because that's an ordinary tort. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

MR. RADMORE: But the mail -- in that

hypothetical, the mail still arrived on time and in good 

condition if they bopped somebody on the head. There 

wouldn't be a bar --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, ordinary tort doesn't 

quite work, because I guess my public humiliation case is 

-- could be an ordinary tort. Somebody could go up to the 

porch and rip it open, nothing to do with the mail. And, 

moreover, somebody could, in fact, delay the transmission 

of my inheritance. See? They could. So, all those 

things could be ordinary torts. 

MR. RADMORE: But they don't have a duty. The 

difference is, in that case, if a -- if a private person 

were to go and open up the package, or if a private person 

were to take your letter that showed that you had an 

inheritance, a private person doesn't have the duty. Only 

the Government has a duty to deliver the mail on time and 

in good condition. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't it have a -- in good 

condition. Therefore, when they put it -- therefore, I 

guess, ripping it open is, in fact, not in good condition, 

so maybe that is immune. And leaving it on the porch in a 

position where somebody would trip over it, you might say 

they didn't deliver it in good condition, because what 

they're supposed to do is place it somewhere where you 

don't trip over it. And that's good condition for the

delivery. 

MR. RADMORE: Well, it's not good condition for 

purposes of ordinary torts. The exception bars a claim 

against the Government for the contents of the package. 

In your hypothetical, Justice Breyer, if the toupee were 

damaged as a result of the package being opened, then you 

could not make a claim, because that was the content of 

the mail, but if you fell over the package, that's an 

ordinary tort, that's a common duty between private 

persons. So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: As is a automobile accident, 

and it -- the Chief suggested to you that there are other 

kinds of people who deliver items. And that kind of 

negligence, you say, is within the exception. 

MR. RADMORE: I'm sorry, I don't --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That --

MR. RADMORE: -- understand your --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That you say --

MR. RADMORE: -- question, Justice Ginsburg. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm sorry. Outside the 

exception. 

MR. RADMORE: Correct. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, there, you're saying that 

the Post Office is just -- it's just like everyone else 

with respect to automobile accidents, right?

 MR. RADMORE: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- and -- you --

therefore, it should be just like everyone else with 

respect to this negligent delivery in --

MR. RADMORE: With respect to ordinary torts. 

If they create -- if the Post Office creates a hazardous 

condition, then they should be a -- responsible, just as 

private persons are. We know that that's the purpose of 

the broad waiver of sovereign immunity under the Federal 

Tort Claims Act, is to make the Government -- or to allow 

private persons to make a claim against the Government if 

there is a duty that is common to private persons. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Radmore, I don't think 

you're quite correct when you say, with regard to an 

automobile accident, it's just like a private entity 

delivering mail -- or delivering packages. If a private 

delivery service had an automobile accident that resulted 

in the destroy -- destruction of a package, a private 

party could sue for the contents of the package. But 

that's not true with regard to the Postal Service. 

MR. RADMORE: That's absolutely correct, Justice 

Stevens. And I believe that that's really the biggest 

problem the Government has with their interpretation of 

negligent transmission, because if there's an exclusion 

for motor-vehicle accidents, then that would mean that

that exclusion would not only apply to the terms of the 

exception "negligent transmission," but, if it's an 

exclusion, as the Government has argued for, though they 

haven't explained why the exclusion wouldn't apply to loss 

and miscarriage, the logical endpoint of their exclusion 

is that if you have a tractor-trailer that has 10,000 IRS 

refund checks on it, and that tractor-trailer is in a 

accident, and all of the refund checks are destroyed, 

well, any private person who didn't get their refund check 

in time, and couldn't pay their mortgage, or they couldn't 

pay for their credit-card bill or they couldn't do 

something as a result of the loss of those refund checks, 

would be able to make a claim against the Government, as 

long as the loss occurred from a motor-vehicle accident. 

They make no explanation as to why that would not be the 

case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you -- the -- you assert 

that would be the case, don't you? 

MR. RADMORE: No, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you assert that they 

would be able to sue. 

MR. RADMORE: Oh, not at all. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. All right. 

MR. RADMORE: If the -- any -- anytime that the 

mail is lost, the mail is delivered to the wrong location,

MR. RADMORE: -- through negligence, regardless 

if it's a motor-vehicle accident, then the Government is 

protected. And so, it's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I guess -- I --

following up on Justice Stevens' question, your theory 

with respect to negligent transmission is that the Postal 

Service should be liable in the same way that private 

parties are. But that theory doesn't hold up when you're 

talk -- that's not your theory. 

MR. RADMORE: That's not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then, what is your 

MR. RADMORE: Our theory is, if there's damage 

to the mail, there's an exception to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's --

MR. RADMORE: -- some --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought 

that was miscarriage. 

MR. RADMORE: Damage? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or loss. 

MR. RADMORE: Well, if it was -- if it was the

same as miscarriage or loss, then that makes the whole 

term "negligent transmission" superfluous. And this Court 

has told us that every term in an -- in the -- any 

exception should be viewed so as --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's only 

superfluous under your reading. If it covers, for 

example, putting the package -- negligently placing the 

package in a location where it's going to cause injury, 

well, then it's not superfluous. 

MR. RADMORE: Well, in a broad -- that's true if 

you're going to read the words so broadly that -- it would 

then make "loss" and "miscarriage" superfluous." 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you're using --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: You're -- no, please. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just -- it 

wouldn't make it superfluous at all. "Loss" would cover 

loss. "Miscarriage" would cover damage. And "negligent 

transmission" would be transmitting it negligently, such 

as leaving it where somebody's going to trip over it. 

MR. RADMORE: But the broad interpretation that 

the Government asks for, and that the Third Circuit 

followed, was that "negligent transmission" covered 

anything that occurred to the mail from the time the mail 

was dropped off at the Post Office until it arrived at a

third -- to the third person. So, with that broad 

definition of "negligent transmission," anything that 

occurred, whether it was a loss of the mail, whether it 

was misdelivered to the wrong location, would be covered, 

and that would make the words "loss" and "miscarriage" 

superfluous. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you're taking as your prime 

-- or a prime example of what would be covered by the 

exception of "negligent transmission" the package that is 

delivered to the right place on time and all the china 

inside the box is smashed. I mean, that would be an 

example that would fit your theory. 

MR. RADMORE: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

MR. RADMORE: There would be a bar. The bar 

would apply. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: And you would -- you would say 

that's supported by the -- you know, the noscitur a sociis 

argument, because it's damage of -- to the mail, or the 

condition of the mail, or the manner in which the mail 

itself is delivered, but it -- that's more or less where 

you -- where you think the exception should stop. 

MR. RADMORE: That's more, rather --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

MR. RADMORE: -- than less. That's exactly

where we think --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, your theory is basically 

that the exception just deals with bad things that happen 

to the mail. 

MR. RADMORE: Well, it also would protect the 

Government when there is a -- either a personal injury or 

some kind of loss, a personal injury or an economic loss 

that arises from the damage or delay to the mail. You 

know, I think I brought up the example of the medication 

or if -- if you had a check or a coupon bond that was 

destroyed. There would --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that would be, in each case 

-- in each example you're giving, as I understand it, that 

would be as a consequence to a violation that affected the 

mail, itself, in the first place. 

MR. RADMORE: Yes, Justice Souter. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: I lose the -- I lose the money, 

because the mail is slow, or whatever. 

MR. RADMORE: Yes, Justice Souter, exactly. 

And if there's no other questions, I'll reserve 

the remainder of my time.

 MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Justice O'Connor, when you mentioned that this 

is a waiver of sovereign immunity and we have to construe 

that with that in mind, it's, sort of, central to our 

starting to our point for understanding this statute. 

This claim falls squarely within the text of the 

statutory exception, and there doesn't seem to be much 

dispute about that. And the question is whether --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it true that it 

falls squarely within the word "transmission," just 

exactly as an automobile accident arising out of carrying 

-- transmitting mail does? 

MS. MILLETT: It falls with --

JUSTICE STEVENS: They are both equally within 

the plain language. 

MS. MILLETT: It falls within the word 

"transmission," but the relevant phrase is "negligent 

transmission of mail or postal matter." And --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Which is happening in the --

in the truck when it has an accident. 

MS. MILLETT: But what you're suing over in that 

case -- and this is exactly the line this Court drew in 

Kosak -- your claim isn't -- it has to arise out of the 

negligent transmission of mail. Your claim, when the --

when the delivery truck or the postal truck rear-ends you, 

doesn't arise out of the handling of the mail; it arises 

out of the handling of the vehicle. There's two 

activities going on at the same time, and you're suing 

about the one, and not the other. And I think it's a --

it's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose you have a big 

crate that the postman uses, because you've been away for 

a week and yet the mail -- and he leaves a crate there, 

and you trip on the crate. Under your view, there would 

be liability, because the crate's like the -- the crate 

isn't the mail. 

MS. MILLETT: I think, at that point, sort of, 

the crate and the mail have become one thing, as if he 

left it in a bag or he -- they put a plastic bag around it 

to protect it from the rain, and technically you would 

trip over the plastic bag, but it's the lump of mail that 

you're tripping over. I mean, if the crate had some bar 

sticking out, and all you tripped over was the bar and not 

the mail, then that might be a different case. But I do 

think that we have to look carefully at whether it arises 

out of the handling of the mail. And that is a 

distinction that protects the activity that the Postal 

Service is engaged in that Congress wanted to protect, the 

handling of the mail. It's a -- it's a protection for the

post, but it --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the key word in the 

statute is "transmission," not "the transmission of 

letters or postal matter." 

MS. MILLETT: The key words, I think, are the 

whole exception, which is "arising out of the negligent 

transmission of mail." It's not "negligent activities of 

the Postal Service." The text focuses -- it's a 

protection for the post, not the Postal Service. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But --

MS. MILLETT: And just as if you're --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But if that's true, why do you 

need the words "miscarried" -- why do you need the word 

"miscarriage" in the statute? 

MS. MILLETT: I think "miscarriage" captures 

delivery to the wrong person, which doesn't harm the mail, 

itself. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you -- but so would the 

word "transmission" if you -- under your reading, you 

don't need the word "miscarriage." 

MS. MILLETT: What -- "transmission" adds a lot 

-- I think if you look, sort of, sequentially, the way 

Congress was thinking -- and it may not have been at, sort 

of, this level -- but "loss" is mail that doesn't go 

anywhere, it doesn't get there. "Miscarriage" gets to the

wrong person. "Transmission" gets to the right person, 

but something went wrong in the process. And so, if you 

look at it that way, yes, there's no doubt there's 

overlap, but "transmission" captures a lot more than just 

"miscarriage." It is important to understand that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It covers damage, for one 

thing. 

MS. MILLETT: It covers --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You --

MS. MILLETT: It covers damage. It covers --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which "loss" doesn't, and 

"miscarriage" doesn't. 

MS. MILLETT: Absolutely. And the same delay 

may, or not, be with them. But the other thing that 

Petitioner's theory doesn't capture -- they're two very 

important things. One is the decision to admit things to 

the mail in the first place. If it ends up being a 

letterbomb or, unfortunately, anthrax, or biohazards -- I 

mean, we ship poisons, we ship medical specimens, we ship 

live alligators. I mean, every -- you wouldn't believe 

what goes into the mail. 

[Laughter.] 

MS. MILLETT: And there has to be some 

protection for that decision to admit things into the mail 

in the first place. The other thing it doesn't capture is

the very important decisions that post -- the Post Office 

has to make about getting the mail to someone on time. 

Part of that is how I get it there. And it's -- it 

includes not just how I get the millions of packages every 

day that don't fit in a mailbox or a mail slot to their 

customers; it includes how, after a hurricane, we decide 

to deliver mail outside the Superdome or to people whose 

mailboxes have been blown off of their houses. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So, how does it hurt you, say, 

in the live alligator, et cetera, case? If the Court says 

-- well, anything that's special in respect to 

transmission of live alligators, because it's the mail, et 

cetera, delayed -- or I -- I don't know how else you'd get 

a tort out of it. But if it's simply the kind of thing 

that anyone could do, like driving a postal truck or 

leaving something on a porch that somebody trips over or 

walking along the street swinging the live alligator over 

your head, or whatever you do –-

doing it -- that kind of thing doesn't mean to fall within 

the "transmission." Now, suppose that that was the 

holding. How would the Government be hurt? 

MS. MILLETT: First of all, that -- if the -- if 

the exception, as I understand it, is that of harms to or 

from the content of the mail, that isn't going to --

JUSTICE BREYER: What we'd look to is, you'd 

look to the purpose of this. The purpose of it was, 

basically, I gather from the history, as recounted in 

Kosak -- in what the Court said in Kosak -- the purpose of 

this is to try to bring back into sovereign immunity, so 

you're not sued all the time, the very kind of common suit 

that a person could protect himself for the loss by 

registering the package, by taking out this ordinary 

transmission insurance, which is not that hard to do. So, 

they said, if we start opening it up to misdelivery 

claims, all that pack -- family of things, everybody'll 

say, "Hey, you hurt my pet, you didn't give me the check." 

I mean, all kinds of things will be opened up. 

But the Government's already liable for what I'd 

call the "swinging the package around," leaving it --

slip-and-fall, trucks. So that falls on the other side. 

Now, how does that hurt you, the Government, if that's how 

we'd come out? 

MS. MILLETT: It hurts us -- I mean, my starting

point, first of all, is this text, and not legislative 

history or purpose --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you can't get too far --

MS. MILLETT: -- which is --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- with the text. I think you 

have a great claim, and so does the other side; but if 

it's just the text, that's not my question. 

MS. MILLETT: Okay. But I --

JUSTICE BREYER: The question is, If I think the 

text is perfectly ambiguous on this, I look to the 

purpose, suppose I came out the way I just said. How 

would the Government be hurt? is what I want to know. 

MS. MILLETT: What the Government is hurt by is 

the fact that you're -- some -- you're allowing torts for 

the one activity that is distinct to the Postal Service 

amongst governmental agencies, and that is the act of 

delivering. That is what the transmission exception 

protects. When you're -- when you're driving a vehicle, 

the postal employee is making the -- is not making mail-

specific judgments. The postal employee is making the 

same judgments that I made driving to work today and that 

everyone else on the road makes. But when you are making 

decisions about how to deliver 660 million pieces of mail 

a day to 142 million different locations -- the bottom of 

the Grand Canyon, remote Alaska, and urban cities -- that

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- mail-specific any different 

than the grocery boy -- I mean, than the grocery-specific, 

under your view? 

MS. MILLETT: No, but it's clear that Congress 

wanted to capture negligence. I mean, it's the -- it --

the fact that -- there has to be an analog to private 

people, or we're not in the Federal-Tort-Claims-Act land 

anyhow. The question is, Which of those activities? And 

the text focuses on --

MS. MILLETT: -- the actual --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you're saying -- you're --

you want us to say that mail is somehow unique. But it 

isn't. There's all kinds of delivery. 

MS. MILLETT: It -- whether or not it's unique, 

Congress focused on the presence of mail in a mail-

specific judgment. That's how we read --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm saying --

MS. MILLETT: -- the text --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it's not mail-specific,

because all delivery people have the same problem. 

MS. MILLETT: The mail --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, why is it mail-specific? 

MS. MILLETT: First of all, the decision to put 

it into a mailbox is a uniquely postal --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and letters are carried 

in a mail truck, but we allow a cause of action for 

negligence of the driver of the mail truck. That's unique 

to mail, too. 

MS. MILLETT: Drive the -- driving is not unique 

to the mail. It's not, even amongst agencies, let alone 

amongst private parties. The -- what --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're leaving something --

MS. MILLETT: And it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That was the very point, 

leaving something on the porch where somebody can trip on 

it isn't unique to mail --

MS. MILLETT: It doesn't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- just as driving a truck 

isn't. 

MS. MILLETT: It doesn't have to be unique to 

mail. If it is unique to mail, if there's no private-

party analog, the Federal Tort Claims Act doesn't apply, 

by its own terms. But what -- I mean, there is a distinct 

and unique postal act of putting things into the mailbox.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So, if --

MS. MILLETT: And if it --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- in fact, you have a driver 

of the truck, the postal truck, and what he does is, he 

puts the mail in the truck, so my skis, which I have 

shipped by mail, happen to stick out the side, and, as he 

walk -- drives along, he just mows down the pedestrians. 

[Laughter.] 

JUSTICE BREYER: I take it, on your theory, that 

that -- there is no lawsuit. 

MS. MILLETT: The -- if your damage -- harms to 

and from the mail, yes. Yes, that is our position. If he 

mows 'em down with his arm or with his rearview mirror on 

his truck, your -- the liability attaches. 

But you asked why it is important, Justice 

Breyer. And one of the reasons it's very important is to 

look at these types of claims. The Postal Service is 

defenseless. We are essentially defenseless when we get 

one of these claims. Unlike a vehicle accident, where we 

are a party to it and know what happens when it happens, 

this type of injury, we may not know about for up to two 

years after --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let --

MS. MILLETT: -- it happens. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- let me ask you about

defenses. And it goes a little bit beyond the suit, but, 

as I -- I read through the regulations, and it's the duty 

of the occupant, or the recipient, of the mail to provide 

a box or a letter slot or something. Would the failure to 

do that, so that they just have to put it on the porch --

is that a defense? 

MS. MILLETT: I'd --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume there's 

liability. 

MS. MILLETT: Uh-huh. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume that your 

interpretation of the statute does not prevail here. Does 

the Post Office have a defense if the person doesn't 

provide a mailbox, as the regulations require? 

MS. MILLETT: I'm not going to say here that we 

wouldn't have some defenses that me may want to invoke at 

a future time, but I'm not very optimistic, because I 

think the fact that you -- they may not have a box doesn't 

mean that we could put it -- assuming your theory that 

we're liable -- put it somewhere negligently --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is --

MS. MILLETT: -- as opposed --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there --

MS. MILLETT: -- nonnegligently. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there regulations

requiring that the mail be put in a reasonably safe place? 

And by that, I mean reasonably safe for the occupant, not 

reasonably safe for the mail. 

MS. MILLETT: It --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- because you quote --

you quote, on page 2, the footnote -- you quote the 

regulation. But I read that, that it has to be reasonably 

safe for the mail, because it says, "Oh, you can leave it 

on a stairway or under a porch, just so long as it's safe 

for the mail." That's the way I read that one. 

MS. MILLETT: I mean, I think they make the --

as a practical -- is there text in the Domestic Mail 

Manual that specifically says, "Put it where somebody 

won't slip"? No. I think it's the same judgment that's 

being made. They're making the best judgments that they 

can, but there is -- you know, they're, sort of, caught 

between them. So, they need to put it somewhere where 

it's sheltered, and that tends to be close up to 

buildings. And the problem is, it's not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess my point --

MS. MILLETT: -- once it's on the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- my point is, if there's a 

duty, then it seems to me the Post Office is used to 

making these judgments. And if it does not make the 

correct judgment, it can be sued.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm just saying that you're

MS. MILLETT: The except --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that much different than 

any institution faced with slip-and-fall cases. 

MS. MILLETT: The except -- it is different --

the exception applies whether we do it negligently or 

nonnegligently. And so, the fact that we didn't happen to 

do it, at least allegedly, negligently in this case isn't 

what -- can't be what triggers the exception. And what is 

different is, you -- understanding, as a practical matter, 

what the postal carriers are supposed to do millions of 

times every day when the mail doesn't fit --

JUSTICE BREYER: But are -- you got the -- well, 

that's exactly the point I'd like you to hone in on, 

because I don't see what's -- you say, "Well, we're 

defenseless." Why are you more defenseless than any other 

business that leaves things on porches? That might be, 

you know, 482 million apple deliverers or Domino Pizza

people. I don't know. Or they -- they ring the bell, 

probably, but some -- McDonald's hamburgers, lots of --

department stores. I mean, a lot of people leave things 

on porches. So, why are you more defenseless than they? 

MS. MILLETT: Because -- because we -- first of 

all, we leave it there for 37 cents, and we leave it in a 

volume -- 660 million pieces of -- a day. FedEx and UPS 

aren't even in the neighborhood --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, are you talking

letters, though, right? I mean, I -- they -- is FedEx and

to be left --

MS. MILLETT: No. We --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- on the porch? 

MS. MILLETT: 660 million includes letters and 

packages. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

MS. MILLETT: UPS does, I think, about 12 

million a day; FedEx, about 5 million.

likely to trip over. I mean, they're not likely to trip 

over a letter. 

MS. MILLETT: A number of letters bundled -- I 

wouldn't -- I wouldn't be surprised to see what could 

happen if, in fact, the liability is allowed. If you're 

-- you know, you go to put it into the mailbox, and a 

piece slips out of the mailman's hand and lands on the 

porch, and it's one of those cellophane envelopes, and 

it's slippery. I mean, that's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have any sense --

MS. MILLETT: -- maybe all that it takes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- of how many claims of this 

nature there are? I know we do have the Second Circuit 

case, on one side. And, by the way, I didn't notice that 

you refer to the Second Circuit decision in your brief.

But, do you have any notion of how many slip-and-fall, 

trip-over-mail cases -- claims are filed? 

MS. MILLETT: I can give you a rough estimate. 

There are -- there are 700 -- about 700 slip-and-fall 

cases a year, but the vast, vast majority of those are 

slipping in a building on, you know, a slippery floor, 

which we concede liability for. Probably, you know --

less than a dozen, around ten or so a year, thus far. But 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You concede --

MS. MILLETT: -- we've been able to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- liability for a slippery 

fall in the Post Office. 

MS. MILLETT: Yes. We --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 

MS. MILLETT: -- concede liability for that,

because that -- just like -- that's not handling of the 

mail, that's handling of a building or handling of a 

vehicle, which we see different from handling of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there was --

MS. MILLETT: -- the mail. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- there was, in one of the 

briefs, an example where there's a puddle created by the 

janitor. The Post Office is liable. It's -- relates to 

taking care of the building. There's a parcel of mail 

that has a liquid in it, and it's dropped, and the puddle 

is created by the that. No liability. And you agree that 

that would be the result? 

MS. MILLETT: If we break -- if we break --

whatever damage is done to the mail, and the package in 

the mail, the liquid in the mail cannot be sued over. 

That is -- and I think Petitioners agree -- damage to and 

from the mail --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you agree --

MS. MILLETT: -- is our conception. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that that hypothetical --

MS. MILLETT: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- is correct? And there's 

another one that they gave. The letter carrier comes. 

He's got a mailbag filled with mail, dumps it on the 

street while he takes a rest, somebody trips over it.

That's case one. Case two is, he's finished making his 

rounds, and he dumps the sack on the street, it has no 

mail in it, and somebody trips over it. On your theory of 

the case, would there be liability in both situations or 

only in the one where the mailbag was stuffed full of 

mail? 

MS. MILLETT: If you're tripping over mail, and 

the mail bag has mail in it, there's no liability. You're 

harmed from the mail. If it's from mail apparatus or, you 

know, a postal employee's leg sticking out while they're 

sleeping, then we will admit liability for that. The 

focus -- our view of the focus of this exception, I think, 

by its text -- and this is exactly what the Court said in 

Kosak -- is on the handling of the mail, and that is a 

very important line for the Postal Service. They have to 

make hard judgments --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that you -- my biggest 

hangup -- and I wish you'd go through your distinguishing 

of it again -- is the -- is the Kosak case. Carrying the 

mail in a mail truck is the handling of the mail. There 

is no doubt that it's the handling of the mail. And it 

seems to me it doesn't -- it isn't enough to say, "Well, 

other people drive trucks, too." Well, that's true. But 

other people deliver packages, too, and leave 'em on the 

doorstep. How do you distinguish Kosak?

 MS. MILLETT: I think -- in -- first of all, 

it's just dicta in Kosak, which, in fact, construed the 

customs exception to include both -- you know, not to turn 

upon the type of damage that ensued, so we actually are 

asking for the sort of same analysis of the holding in 

Kosak -- the dicta in Kosak about motor vehicles is 

different -- I think if I could just -- for the logical 

reason, if someone rear-ends you, you don't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. 

MS. MILLETT: Uh-huh. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're -- I assume the 

Government has conceded Kosak, the dictum in Kosak. 

MS. MILLETT: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, do you concede that point, 

or not? 

MS. MILLETT: We --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If you concede the point, it 

doesn't matter whether it's dictum. 

MS. MILLETT: I agree, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, you --

MS. MILLETT: -- I wanted to point out that the 

holding --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you are trying to draw a 

distinction between driving the mail in the truck and 

leaving the mail on the doorstep. What's the basis for

that distinction? 

MS. MILLETT: And that language has to be read 

against the backdrop of the holding of Kosak, which 

recognized that when you have exceptions that are written 

in these broad terms, the form of the injury, the 

particular type of personal injury -- there, it was 

property injury -- that ensues doesn't change whether the 

exception applies. 

Motor vehicles are different. If you're rear-

ended by a truck, you don't jump out and say, "Hey, you 

negligently transmitted the mail." You say -- you jump 

out and you say, "You didn't -- your brake lights weren't 

working," "You didn't signal." Those are -- there are not 

judgments about the handling of the mail being made that 

the claim arises out of. You're not suing about how we 

handled the mail; you're suing about how we handled motor 

vehicles. Yes, at --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if the --

MS. MILLETT: -- 30,000 feet, it's all --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if the postman 

throws the box onto the porch and hits somebody there, you 

say that's within the exception? 

MS. MILLETT: Yes, that's -- if we --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you don't say, "Hey, 

you hit me with the mail," right? You say, "You hit me

with a box." 

MS. MILLETT: Your claim arises out of how we 

handled the mail, not how handled a vehicle, not how we 

handled a building, not how we handled --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your claim --


MS. MILLETT: -- mail apparatus. 


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- arises out of how he 


handled the box, just like --

MS. MILLETT: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in the other case it 

arises out of how he handled the vehicle. You don't care 

whether it's the mail or not. By the same token, when you 

trip over something -- a box -- you don't care whether 

it's a mail box or if it's the box from UPS. And yet, in 

your case, it makes all the difference in the world. 

MS. MILLETT: Perhaps I misunderstood. If -- I 

thought the box was the mail, itself, that you're throwing 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 


MS. MILLETT: -- out of -- and if the box -- but 


your injury arises -- if it's to or from the mail --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

MS. MILLETT: -- it's within the exception. 

And, yes, there are fine lines, as with any of these 

distinctions. In practice -- in practice -- for the

practical reason that you don't have the sheer volume of 

claims, against which the Postal Service is largely 

defenseless, that you have when you start talking --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose your --

MS. MILLETT: -- about delivering --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- defense affects the 

process. In other words, you would, more and more, be 

leaving those -- the little slips of paper saying, "Go 

down to the Post Office and pick up your package," rather 

than leaving the package on the porch. 

MS. MILLETT: I think that's exactly right. And 

it's hard to -- I mean, that is -- you know, what happens 

here when I show up with oversized mail, as a mail 

carrier? I've got the choice of delaying your receipt of 

the mail by taking it back to the Postal Service, 

inconveniencing you, making you come downtown. That act 

is within the exception. I can try a person-to-person 

delivery. But the Postal Service went away from that, for 

logical reasons, because that will delay everybody else's 

mail, and there's no liability for all of those delays. 

If you set this same package down, and it has 

medicine or food in it -- it says -- marked "perishable" 

on the outside -- it's in the sun, it goes rotten, the 

person gets sick, there's no liability. But the -- this 

is a protection for an activity of the Government, like

the -- many of the other Federal Tort Claim Act 

exceptions. And the protection for that activity is an 

upfront protection that doesn't turn on the happenstance 

of which particular form of injury is manifested at --

hours later. And it's an important reason, as I said, not 

only for the sheer volume of claims that we could face if 

this is opened up on how we deliver, but all -- our 

inability to defend, when, two years later, we simply do 

not -- unlike FedEx or UPS, or probably the pizza 

delivery, we can't recreate, months later, how we 

delivered the mail --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes, but you're --

MS. MILLETT: -- unless it's registered. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you're using the word 

"deliver," but the statutory word is "transmit." And --

are there other statutes or regulations in respect to the 

Post Office that talk about "delivery"? 

MS. MILLETT: There --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the word -- because it 

seems to me -- the omission of "delivery," it seems to me, 

is a real problem for you, in your theory of the case. 

MS. MILLETT: No, I don't think so. And, as we 

chronicle at length in our brief, both through history and 

contemporaneously, the use of the word "transmit" and 

"transmission" in postal services is commonplace, and it

means delivery to -- it means getting something to the 

person. Congress has consistently used "transmission" 

that way. 

And the other thing I would like to bring you 

back to is, understand that the reason the vehicle 

distinction worked -- one of the reasons Congress would 

have expected that is, that had happened before in 

history. We show, again in our brief, a number of cases. 

For a long time, there have been distinctions between 

allowing liability for -- and back then, it was stagecoach 

drivers that drove too fast through town. And those cases 

were held -- you know, when you -- when you held someone 

liable for driving too fast through town, that was held 

not to be a stoppage of the mail, stoppage of the 

transmission of the mail. But when you tried to regulate, 

more fundamentally, how the Postal Service decided to do 

its deliveries, and whom it would authorize to undertake 

the delivery, that was held to interfere with the mails. 

And I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: What about -- but I'm surprised 

that there's no empirical examples of what -- well, I 

would think it would have happened, in 50 years and tens 

of millions of packages, that a package falls off a truck. 

You know, the next driver veers somewhere and gets into 

an accident, and they say it was the -- it wasn't packed

properly. I think should have happened sometime in the 

Post Service over -- Postal Service over 50 year. My 

guess is, it did happen and you just paid. 

MS. MILLETT: My guess is that we did not pay, 

because that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Really? 

MS. MILLETT: -- would be an injury rising --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any --

MS. MILLETT: -- to and from the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Do we actually know, either of 

us? I don't, I confess. Do you -- do you --

MS. MILLETT: I don't, off the top of my head, 

but I -- you know, the distinctions that -- in talking 

with the Postal Service here, I mean, it may -- it -- one 

would -- think it might have happened, but perhaps it 

hasn't. Hopefully, it hasn't. But, if it has, I mean, 

it's a fine distinction. And any tort -- you know, a 

first-year tort student knows that tort lines can, you 

know, give rise to difficult analysis at times. But if 

you understand that what Congress was trying to protect 

here was the movement of the mail and the handling of the 

mail in a way that the Postal Service does --

distinction. You say there is no liability for the 

package that falls off the back of the truck, but there is 

liability if the truck hits another vehicle. I really 

don't understand the basis for that distinction. 

MS. MILLETT: The claim for the -- if we're 

assuming it's a mispacking of the mail into the truck, is 

the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MS. MILLETT: -- is the claim --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which happens all the time in 

other trucks, not just mail trucks. 

MS. MILLETT: -- then that is -- that is an -- I 

mean, plain text of the statute, that is a -- an 

allegation that we negligently transmitted the mail. We 

handled it negligently in how we packaged it. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you can say the same thing 

about the driving of the truck that contains the mail. 

MS. MILLETT: You can say that, but what -- when 

someone's -- you know, sues, what they're upset about is 

how you handled the vehicle, not how you handled the mail. 

Yes, at 30,000 feet, you can look at this and say it's 

all transmission. But Congress was looking at this as, 

sort of, on-the-ground level. And, in practical 

experience, the -- the person who was hit by the mail 

truck doesn't care if there's mail in there or not. Their

injury is completely unaffected -- the presence of mail is 

incidental, irrelevant --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Same thing with the --

MS. MILLETT: -- to that liability. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- same thing with the person 

who veers to avoid the package that falls off the back of 

the mail truck. 

MS. MILLETT: No, but that -- what they've been 

injured by -- the presence of mail is the cause of the 

accident --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that does --

MS. MILLETT: -- and the way it was packed --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but the person who trips 

doesn't say, "Oh, this really hurts me because it's mail 

instead of a box of oranges," does he? 

MS. MILLETT: "Who put this mail here? This is 

-- this is -- mail shouldn't be here." I mean, you have 

-- a simple way of looking at it is, you have two things 

going on at the same time in the car, in the vehicle. 

You've got the regular activity of driving, and you've got 

the transmission of mail. But when you come to the porch, 

you have one activity, and one activity only. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but --

MS. MILLETT: And that is transmission --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- your argument, as I

understand it, on the -- on the truck accident and on the 

package that falls out of the truck -- is that the fact 

that mail transmission is going on at the same time is 

utterly irrelevant to the cause of the damage. And isn't 

it equally open to the -- isn't your position equally open 

to the argument that, when the person trips over the 

package on the porch, it is utterly irrelevant that that 

package has been placed there by a postal employee and has 

been carried in the mail? It is in the same -- it has the 

same character, vis-a-vis tripping, that a brick or a rock 

or any other package might have. 

So, if you're going to be consistent with 

respect to the passage of the truck, the package that 

drops out of the truck, and the piece -- and the package 

on the porch, don't you have to say it is irrelevant that 

the package in the porch has been carried in the mail and 

put there by a postal employee? It's its character of 

package at that place that matters. 

MS. MILLETT: It's the character as mail that 

matters. Mail that's been in transmission is what 

matters. And this --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you can say -- then you 

can say exactly the same thing about the package that 

falls off the truck. You can characterize that. You can 

say, "Look, it wouldn't have been in the truck if they

weren't delivering mail." 

JUSTICE SCALIA: She says that. 

MS. MILLETT: What direct --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Pardon me? But you -- and you 

could say that there wouldn't have been any accident with 

the truck if the truck hadn't been delivering mail. 

MS. MILLETT: It may not be delivering mail at 

the time it has an accident with you. There's no way the 

delivery of mail occurs without the actual delivery of 

mail. That's the point. But, again, you have a text here 

that does not admit of distinctions based on what kind of 

injury happens two hours later, whether it's spoiled food, 

an exploding package, or a trip. And if it's difficult --

this is a waiver of sovereign immunity. And the fact that 

this is in the text, this case doesn't involve a vehicle, 

and that this case raises serious concerns for the Postal 

Service about how it's going to handle an enormous --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But can I just --

MS. MILLETT: -- volume of mail. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this question? The case is 

a little bit on the border, because it's a slip-and-fall, 

and it does -- there may not have been negligence. We --

but we're assuming, via the allegations, they're true. 

But your position would apply to an intentional tort, as 

well as a negligent tort, I think, wouldn't it?

 MS. MILLETT: Not if it's transmission of the 

mail, because the exception only applies to negligent 

transmission of the mail. And so, if we intentionally bop 

you over the head with the package, that would not be 

within --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I see. 


MS. MILLETT: -- the exception. 


JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay. 


JUSTICE SOUTER: Would that -- this is neither 


here nor there, I guess, but would that be within the 

waiver? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Negligence --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Intentional --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- torts aren't covered --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- by it, are they? 

MS. MILLETT: No, actually negligent or wrongful 

acts are covered. There's 2680(h), which covers a number 

of intentional torts and -- it's often referred to as the 

intentional-tort exception. But, actually, it wouldn't 

cover -- the -- bopping with a package would probably be 

assault. But if we deliver a package that has anthrax in 

it, I don't know that that would be covered. Maybe we

your mail to your neighbor, knowing that it's got your 

inheritance information in it, I don't think that would 

fall within 2680(h), which normally -- it's essentially --

largely encompasses interference with contracts rights 

instead of physical assault, battery, those types of 

claims.

in mind here that we do have -- we have text -- this is a 

waiver of sovereign immunity, and that this falls within 

the text. There are two ways of looking at it. Their way 

does not capture important things to the Postal Service. 

It doesn't seem to capture what is admitted into the 

mails, and it doesn't seem to capture the important 

decisions that are made -- it may not seem so important, 

in this one case, to have put the mail on the porch, but 

multiply it by tens of millions of times a day when that 

decision is made, and the decision that that balance, of 

putting things there in a sheltered way, hopefully that 

will both protect the mail and the people, instead of 

either reverting to person-to-person delivery for all 

oversized mail or making people come down, like the old 

days, to the Post Office to pick it up. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

Mr. Radmore, you have 7 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. RADMORE 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. RADMORE: Just one point. The choice of 

what to take into the mail would be covered by the 

discretionary-function exception of the exceptions to the 

Federal Tort Claims Act. So, I think that's a red 

herring.

 And with that, if there's no questions, the 

Petitioner will waive the remainder of his rebuttal. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have any -- I 

mean, you'll be responsible, if you prevail, for all of us 

having to go down to the Post Office every time we get --

[Laughter.] 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- packages. I mean, it 

there --

MS. MILLETT: Well, then I'll probably --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- do you have any 

response to that policy concern? 

[Laughter.] 

MS. MILLETT: Then I'll probably be subject to 

some intentional torts, myself. 

[Laughter.] 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the practical 

problem that was raised that, in the automobile accident, 

there's witnesses, there's a police report, usually; but a 

slip-and-fall over mail, nobody's around, these are easily 

made up, and the Post Office has no opportunity to check? 

MR. RADMORE: The Post Office has every 

opportunity, just as in any ordinary tort. All the 

defenses apply. In this particular case, the Post Office 

-- and it's been alluded to by several Justices -- would 

be that they have the defense of contributory negligence.

 They would have any defense that would be available --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the point that -- I think 

that they were making is that there will be an 

investigation, on the spot, ordinarily, in the case of a 

vehicle collision. Post Office won't even know about the 

slip-and-fall until a claim is filed, which could be weeks 

and weeks later. 

MR. RADMORE: But that's -- that's the situation 

in any tort. There doesn't have to be a police report, 

necessarily, in an automobile accident. And in a -- any 

slip-and-fall or any tort, beyond the motor vehicle 

accident, it's the same situation. It's not unique to the 

Post Office. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but the volume is 

unique. In other words, there aren't going to, in a 

typical case, be a lot of witnesses, and the volume is 

unique. And you can't bring the postal carrier in, two 

years after the fact, and say, "Do you remember where you 

placed this parcel on this porch on this day?" 

MR. RADMORE: That's what you'd have to do to a 

UPS or a Federal Express employee. And I believe 

Solicitor General's response to Justice Ginsburg question 

about the number of claims that you have a year -- I 

believe the Solicitor General said situations like this 

arise ten times a year. And the Postal -- the Post

Office's own handbook dealing with the handling of 

negligence cases sets forth procedures and policies that 

deal exactly with this type of circumstance. If we were 

to look at the handbook -- I think, Justice Kennedy 

referred to the handbook, and that section 141 of the 

Postal Investigation Handbook talks about claims that 

arise for personal injury or property damage during the 

delivery of the mail. So, at least since -- and that's 

been -- that was put in place in 1992, so we at least 

know, for the last 13 years, that they've anticipated 

these type of claims. And, according to the Government, 

there's only been ten a year. So, I don't think that 

there's a real concern by the Post Office that there's 

going to be some -- a floodgate of litigation opened up. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

The case is submitted.
