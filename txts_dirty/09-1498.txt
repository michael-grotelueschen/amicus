3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next in Case 09-1498, United States v. Tinklenberg.

 Mr. Roberts. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS 

7  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

8  MR. ROBERTS: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, 

9 and may it please the Court:

 To accommodate important pretrial 

11 proceedings, the Speedy Trial Act contains several 

12 automatic exclusions from its deadline for commencing 

13 trial. This case concerns the exclusion for pretrial 

14 motions, which excludes the period of delay resulting 

from any pretrial motion from the filing of the motion 

16 through the conclusion of the hearing on or other prompt 

17 disposition of such motion. 

18  For more than 30 years, the courts of 

19 appeals had uniformly held that the exclusion applies 

automatically upon the filing of any motion, regardless 

21 of its effect on the trial schedule. The court below 

22 correctly rejected that established rule, which accords 

23 with this Court's decisions, is clear and easy to 

24 administer, and has worked well for over 3 decades.

 The Court's cases construing the exclusion, 

3

1 Henderson and Bloate, support the established rule. 

2 They make clear that the exclusion applies automatically 

3 once a motion is filed without any need for district 

4 court findings. Henderson and Bloate cannot be squared 

with the approach of Respondent and the court below. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, all that might 

7 be true. On the other hand, the statute does say "delay 

8 resulting." And under your approach, the time would be 

9 excluded even if delay does not result.

 MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor. Delay refers 

11 to the interval of time from the filing of the motion 

12 through its disposition, during which the Speedy Trial 

13 Act's deadline is tolled. We know that delay has the 

14 meaning -- delay can often have the meaning of the 

interval of time between two events. 

16  And we know it has that meaning in the 

17 statute here because subsection (D) tells us so. It 

18 defines the period of excludable delay resulting from 

19 the motion as the time from the filing through the 

disposition of the motion. Respondent's definition -足

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the Chief Justice says 

22 only if it -- it's really a circular argument -- only if 

23 it results in a delay. Well, suppose it doesn't result 

24 in a delay?

 MR. ROBERTS: That's assuming that delay is 

4

1 referring to delay of the trial, to a postponement in 

2 the trial. But delay can't have that meaning because if 

3 it has that -- if that meaning is inconsistent with 

4 subsection (D) of the statute's exclusion of the time, 

of saying that delay is the time from the filing of the 

6 motion through the disposition of the motion, because 

7 the statute excludes periods of delay. 

8  And if delay meant postponement of the 

9 trial, then the excluded period would be the time during 

which trial is postponed, but that period is often 

11 significantly shorter or longer than the time from the 

12 filing of the motion to the disposition. And in 

13 Henderson and Bloate -足

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that doesn't -- that 

prove the point that I think is the concern of the Chief 

16 Justice's question, that in some cases the delay -足

17 there's a delay that results and in other cases there 

18 isn't. 

19  MR. ROBERTS: But, Your Honor, the statute 

excludes the period of delay, and then it says the 

21 period of delay is the time from the filing through the 

22 disposition. If delay -- if delay means postponement of 

23 the trial, then all that's excluded by the statute in 

24 the first part is the -- is the time during which trial 

is postponed, but that doesn't match up with subsection 

5

1 (D) because that period is not necessarily the period 

2 from the filing through the disposition. 

3  If I could give you an example. Say a 

4 motion is filed 14 days before trial could begin, and 

the motion takes 16 days to resolve. Trial is postponed 

6 only by two days. And so if delay means the 

7 postponement of trial, then the period of delay should 

8 be 2 days, but the statute says that the delay and the 

9 excludable time is the time from the filing through the 

disposition, which is 16 days. 

11  And that's what this Court held in Henderson 

12 and Bloate, that that's the exact time. So if you adopt 

13 a definition of delay for the first part as a triggering 

14 mechanism that's the postponement of trial, that doesn't 

line up with the rest of the statute. 

16  In addition, that would be a totally 

17 unworkable rule because whether time is excludable would 

18 turn on a complex and often uncertain analysis of 

19 whether the motion would or could delay when trial would 

begin, and it's often going to be difficult or 

21 impossible to make that determination at the time that 

22 the motion is filed. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Roberts, is there -足

24 is there any, anything to indicate that what Congress 

might have had in mind is that in criminal cases 

6

1 inevitably there are going to be motions, and so the 

2 trial judge is likely to set the trial date for after 

3 that period runs? 

4  MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. Sometimes 

trial -- judges might take motions into account in 

6 setting the trial date and other times they might not 

7 take the motions into account. So a rule that -- that 

8 said the exclusion only applies if the judge moves the 

9 trial date in response to the motion would lead to 

arbitrary results. 

11  It would mean basically that whether time 

12 was excludable depended on whether the judge took the 

13 motions into account when it set the trial date 

14 initially or whether the, whether the judge correctly 

estimated the amount of time. And also sometimes 

16 motions may be filed when no trial date is set, so the 

17 rule would be totally unworkable in that situation. 

18  And Respondent, in one of his formulations 

19 for what the test might be, suggests that a motion 

wouldn't create excludable delay unless it would 

21 postpone the hypothetical earliest date on which trial 

22 could otherwise begin. That's just a totally unworkable 

23 rule, because to divine that hypothetical date, courts 

24 would have to assess the effect of multiple different 

factors that could affect when trial would begin, such

1 as: How much time do the parties and the counsel need 

2 for factual investigation and legal analysis? How long 

3 is discovery going to take? 

4  There would be numerous questions that would 

arise about how to apply those factors. For example, 

6 the courts would have to decide: Should they take 

7 potential obstacles to an earlier trial as given, or 

8 should they instead think about whether those obstacles 

9 could be eliminated? The courts would also have to 

figure out what to do if the earliest possible trial 

11 date changed between when the motion was filed and when 

12 the motion was resolved. And how would they take into 

13 account other periods of time that might exclude 

14 delay -- might exclude -- that might be excludable also?

 For example, say a court gets two motions 

16 filed at the same time. Trial could start in 5 days 

17 absent the motion. One motion's going to take 3 days to 

18 resolve; the other motion's going to take 4 days to 

19 resolve. What's the court supposed to do? Is one -- is 

the 3-day motion excluded? Is the 4-day motion 

21 excluded? Are both of the motions excluded? Does it 

22 depend on the order in which the court decides them? It 

23 just is not possible for a court to make these 

24 determinations.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You said at the outset

1 that things have been working fine. Of course, the 

2 whole point of the Act was to hold district judges to a 

3 pretty strict standard, and the concern is that there 

4 might be a very complex case the judge just really wants 

to put off as long as possible and will continue to 

6 accept motion after motion. Is there anything I can -足

7 I can read or consult to show that this has been working 

8 very well and that there's not a problem? 

9  MR. ROBERTS: Well, I -- I can't point to 

anything particular, but there's been no outcry that -足

11 that there's been a problem from pretrial motions being 

12 filed as a -- as an attempt to extend the Speedy Trial 

13 Act deadline. The court's been -- the -- Congress has 

14 reviewed the Speedy Trial Act's operation in the past. 

It made changes in 1979 to address problems that have 

16 occurred. It hasn't felt the need to address this 

17 problem since, and there's no evidence of any abuse of 

18 the automatic exclusion on the other side. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, on that issue, 

do you accept the First Circuit's rule in U.S. v. Hood 

21 that if the government is found to be attempting to 

22 frustrate the operation of the Speedy Trial Act, that 

23 those motions and their delays won't be counted? 

24  MR. ROBERTS: Well, first, Your Honor, I 

don't think that -- that Hood adopted any such rule.

1 The motion -足

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It suggests that 

3 qualification? 

4  MR. ROBERTS: It suggests that there might 

be that qualification. I think that the statute 

6 provides that the -- that any pretrial motion tolls the 

7 deadline, regardless of the purpose for which it's 

8 filed. But, of course, if -- in the unlikely event that 

9 a prosecutor did file a motion solely to extend the 

deadline and avoid proceeding to trial, that conduct 

11 would be sanctionable under -- under the Act, under 

12 section 3162(b)(4). 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Sanctionable against the 

14 government, or -足

MR. ROBERTS: The attorney could be 

16 sanctioned for that. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How does that help a 

18 defendant whose speedy trial rights have been violated? 

19  MR. ROBERTS: Well, the -- the court doesn't 

need to put off trial just because time is excluded, 

21 Your Honor, and the court has other mechanisms that it 

22 can use -足

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You haven't answered my 

24 question. The rights that this statute protects are the 

rights to have your trial start within 70 days absent or

1 extended to these exclusions. If the government 

2 frustrates that and makes the trial start later, why 

3 shouldn't a defendant have the benefit of the Act and 

4 have the indictment dismissed with or without prejudice?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, the statute provides the 

6 circumstances in which time is excludable and in which 

7 time is not, and it doesn't create an exception for 

8 certain kinds of motions. It applies to any pretrial 

9 motion. But I have to say, there's been no evidence 

over the 30 years that anything like this is happening, 

11 and in Hood itself, the motion was filed by defense 

12 counsel, and the court was simply saying that this is 

13 not -- that that's not what's going on here, there's no 

14 suggestion that this motion is part of a process to try 

to frustrate the Act. There's -- the problem just 

16 hasn't arisen. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I hope you 

18 won't sit down without addressing the (h)(1)(F) issue 

19 and explain why we shouldn't reach it, because the issue 

is, as I see it, one of law, not like Nobles, one of 

21 discretion. And although you say it's unimportant 

22 because of a change in Rule 45, how could any criminal 

23 conviction that's inappropriate be unimportant to the 

24 defendant or insignificant enough for this Court to 

address the question once the case is before us?

1  MR. ROBERTS: Well, the Court -- the Court 

2 does decline to address questions if it doesn't consider 

3 them of sufficient importance to -- general importance 

4 to warrant a review. Nobles is one example. There are 

others cited in Stern and Gressman. But the reason that 

6 this issue is not of any ongoing importance is that the 

7 rules have been amended. It now expressly applies to 

8 statutes like this one that don't specify a method for 

9 counting time.

 And, you know, turning to the merits of the 

11 issue, also -- one other point on the importance of it. 

12 The circuits all have adopted the same approach as the 

13 Court of Appeals here, and -足

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Two? How many 

circuits are we talking about? 

16  MR. ROBERTS: Two other circuits, but there 

17 aren't any that have -- that have held to the contrary. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: If we were to decide this 

19 based on subsection (F) involving the counting of 10 

days, wouldn't that render our decision on anything that 

21 we had to say about subsection (D) dictum? 

22  MR. ROBERTS: I don't think it would render 

23 it dictum, Your Honor. The Court can address issues 

24 in -- in whatever order it chooses to, and it doesn't 

mean that the -- the decisions that you make along the

1 way aren't precedential and binding if they're part of 

2 the rationale to get there. But we would -- we don't 

3 think -足

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not part of the 

rationale. The rationale for our decision would be 

6 (h)(1)(D) alone, and all the other discussion would be 

7 perfectly gratuitous, because we're going to set this 

8 individual free anyway. To say, well, this other thing 

9 is not a good reason to set them free, but this one is, 

I mean, that -- the former is just utterly irrelevant to 

11 our decision. 

12  MR. ROBERTS: Well, Your Honor, the 

13 Respondent offered this argument as a ground not to 

14 grant certiorari in its -- in his brief in opposition. 

The Court nonetheless took the case. The circuits are 

16 divided on this -- this issue -足

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not disagreeing with 

18 you. I'm trying to help you. 

19  MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think you could -- I'm 

not sure that I think that it would be impermissible for 

21 -- for the Court to decide the issues in that order, but 

22 if you think so and you think that that's a reason -足

MR. ROBERTS: I think the courts of appeals 

6 would follow it. But -- but I'm not arguing that you 

7 should just -足

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's their fault; they 

9 shouldn't follow dictum, you know?

 MR. ROBERTS: I'm not trying to argue you 

11 should decide the issue. We don't think you should 

12 decide the issue. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it because, 

14 Mr. Roberts, as you pointed out, it's not a continuing 

problem since the amendment to Rule 45, it's calendar 

16 days, and so there's no problem, and so what you're 

17 suggesting is we would not have granted cert on that 

18 question? 

19  MR. ROBERTS: Exactly. You wouldn't have 

granted cert on the question. It's of no continuing 

21 importance. It's not going to affect cases going 

22 forward, and there's no reason for the Court to reach 

23 out and decide it. In any event, the court of appeals 

24 correctly decided the question. The -- the statute 

doesn't specify whether the 10 days are calendar days or

1 business days, and it's therefore reasonable to infer 

2 that Congress expected that the -- that the courts would 

3 interpret the provision in accordance with the counting 

4 rules that are applicable in similar criminal contexts.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It -- it may be 

6 pertinent on this question: Mr. Tinklenberg was 

7 designated for transfer to MCC in Chicago on November 

8 10th. How was that done? Was that done by -- is that a 

9 court order or is that an administrative -足

MR. ROBERTS: I believe what happened is the 

11 court ordered -- the court ordered on the 2nd that there 

12 should be a competency examination. On the 10th, the -足

13 the BOP designated that the MCC would be where the 

14 competency examination -足

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the BOP did it, 

16 not a court? 

17  MR. ROBERTS: -- would take place. 

18  Yes. And on then the 10th was, as it turns 

19 out, was a Thursday before Veterans Day. Then there was 

Veterans Day, and November 12th and 13th were the 

21 weekend. So on the next Monday the Marshals Service 

22 asked the Justice Transportation Service to transport 

23 the defendant. But the way these things worked is that 

24 when there are interdistrict transportation, they use 

airlifts that go around the country; and the airlifts go

8 the last court order before he was moved was on the 2nd. 

9  MR. ROBERTS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is -- is it right that the 

11 Rules Committee then changed it, and it basically said

Breyer proposes is to set free someone who has been duly

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there's a lot

12 its terms applies to computing any period of time 

13 specified in these rules, any local rule or any court 

14 order. None of that includes the statute at issue here, 

correct? 

16  MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. Our argument 

17 is not that the rule by its terms applies. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So this whole debate 

19 about whether the rule applies or not is irrelevant. 

The only question is what does the statute intend, 

21 correct?

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's go back to -- I 

2 don't think you should have been so happy with the way 

3 the argument was going -足

4  (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- because -- because 

6 your view is, Rule 40 -- if it's always assumed that 

7 there be conformity between Rule 45 -- Rule 45, it was 

8 business days, and then rule 45 changed not only to say 

9 calendar days, but included statutes for the first time.

 So I think what you're saying is that the 

11 interpretation of the statute tracks with Rule 45, Rule 

12 45 formerly was calendar -- was business days, it is now 

13 calendar days, there is conformity. And plus, "statute" 

14 is in Rule 45, and that was at least laid on the table 

of Congress, so they know that it was there. 

16  MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. I think that 

17 -- that the statute always meant the same thing, and 

18 that it meant that 10 days should be interpreted in 

19 light of whatever the background rule is at the time for 

counting the time. And so there's no -- there's no new 

21 rule; at the time the 10 days meant exclude the weekends 

22 and holidays, and now because the background rule has 

23 changed, it means count the weekends, and -足

6  MR. ROBERTS: Well -足

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where in the statute 

8 does it -- say, apply the criminal rules? 

9  MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think that -- that my 

point is that when it doesn't specify whether it's 

11 business or calendar days, that Congress anticipated the 

12 courts would say, okay, let's look to the background 

13 rule; and the place, the sensible place to look to the 

14 background rule is the rule -- is a rule of criminal 

procedure in analogous contexts. 

16  In fact, courts frequently do that when 

17 they're trying to interpret statutes to figure out what 

18 the 10-day limit is/ as many of the -- many of the cases 

19 cited in the ALR article that Respondent cites show.

 JUSTICE ALITO: When you're trying -- when 

21 you're trying to figure out -- when you're dealing with 

22 procedural rules that involve filing things in court, it 

23 was once thought to make sense to exclude weekends 

24 because things couldn't be filed on the weekends, but 

when you're talking about transporting a prisoner. What

2  MR. ROBERTS: Well -足

3  JUSTICE ALITO: Do these flights of 

4 prisoners from one facility to another come to a stop 

when -- you know, when the whistle blows on Saturday -足

6 on Friday afternoon? 

7  MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor, generally the 

8 flights don't occur on the weekends or holidays. That 

9 was sort of what I was trying to explain in my extended 

digression to the Chief -- to the Chief Justice before. 

11  The BOP doesn't admit and discharge 

12 prisoners on the weekends. In addition, there are 

13 various other factors that -- that go into the need to 

14 have two -- two deputy marshals transporting people. So 

the transportation doesn't generally occur on the 

16 weekends. And it's because of the weekends and holidays 

17 that the transportation of the defendant actually took 

18 the amount of time that it -- that it did here. 

19  But I would say, as I started, in urging you 

not to address this issue, which is of no ongoing 

21 importance, that the question that we did ask the Court 

22 to address and that the Court granted review on is a 

23 very important question that's divided the circuits; and 

24 that allowing the rule that the court below adopted to 

continue to stand could frustrate the application of the

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 

11  ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 

12  MR. FISHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

13 please the Court: 

14  Before turning to the substance, I would 

like to, if I may, start with the procedural question 

16 that Justice Sotomayor raised and that -- and that my 

17 opponent just completed with, because I want to be sure 

18 there's no confusion on the posture of this case. 

19  In particular, this Court's precedents 

squarely reject the notion that there's any history in 

21 this Court's precedents for refusing to reach an 

22 argument in this posture. In particular, in Langness v. 

23 Green, 282 U.S. 531, this Court held in 1931 that a 

24 Respondent's, quote, "right" to defend a judgment below 

on a ground that is properly preserved all along and 

25

25

1 that the lower court reached and rejected is, quote, 

2 "beyond successful challenge." 

3  Now, I'm not sure -- I'm not aware of any 

4 exception from that rule in the 80 years since.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the petition here 

6 had simply raised one question, and that is the question 

7 of how you count time under -- under a version of Rule 

8 45 of the Federal Rules Of Criminal Procedure that is 

9 not -- no longer in effect and as to which there is no 

conflict in the circuits. How would you grade the 

11 chances of the Court taking cert on that? 

12  MR. FISHER: Well, I'll take your 

13 hypothetical, Justice Alito, but I do want to be able to 

14 correct the notion that it's of no longer continuing 

importance. But I'll assume that your hypothetical on 

16 that kind of a question would be cert denied. But 

17 that's never been an obstacle to reaching the question. 

18  Let me give you two things that are very 

19 important here. The first is the problem with the 

Government's citation to Nobles is not just a 

21 distinction between discretion and law. If you look at 

22 the Solicitor General's own reply brief in that case, it 

23 pointed out that the problem with the alternative 

24 argument there was that it would give the defendant 

different relief. So it was therefore subject to the 

26
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 cross-petitions rule, and that's the section in Stern 

2 and Gressman that's cited in their brief. Those are the 

3 only two citations they have, the citations to Nobles 

4 and the citations to Stern and Gressman, which are all 

about cross-petitions when the defendant wants different 

6 relief. We want exactly the same relief. We want a 

7 dismissal on the Speedy Trial Act. 

8  So finally, even if it were somehow 

9 discretionary and this Court were to consider in this 

case breaking from its unbroken precedent of 80 years -足

11 let me give you one more example before I turn to the 

12 discretionary. 

13  In the Walling case in 1947, this Court 

14 reached as an alternative ground the defendant's 

argument that there was insufficient evidence. Now, 

16 that's sort of the quintessential un-cert-worthy 

17 question, but this Court felt required to reach it 

18 because the lower court had reached it and rejected it 

19 and the defendant had preserved it all along in that 

case. 

21  And in the Union Pacific case in 2009 -- I 

22 can keep giving you citations. But let me just say, 

23 even if it were discretionary, you would still want to 

24 reach it in this case, because at pages 18 and 19 of the 

Solicitor General's brief there are citations to a

1 circuit split on this issue. And the new Rule 45 hasn't 

2 made that go away for two reasons. 

3  The first is because the Solicitor General's 

4 own argument now doesn't depend on Rule 45. Instead, 

it's that the Speedy Trial Act on its own terms counts 

6 10 business days, not simply calendar days. And, 

7 second, there continue to be decisions after the 

8 amendment of Rule 45 in which lower courts have said 

9 that this provision means only 10 business days.

 Let me give you one more citation, and 

11 forgive me for this because we didn't get to file a 

12 reply brief in this case on this issue. But the Zabawa 

13 case, 2010 Westlaw, 307-5044, is a case in the Eastern 

14 District of Michigan last summer where the Government's 

own filing, which we looked at on PACER, asked the court 

16 to apply Tinklenberg and hold that subsection (F) meant 

17 only ten business days. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: If I could just come back to 

19 where you started before you go on to these additional 

points. Your argument is that if the Government 

21 petitions for cert on one issue that's a legal issue on 

22 which there's a conflict in the circuits and the 

23 Respondent in a criminal case says that the -- asks to 

24 have the decision below affirmed on 15 other grounds, we 

-- and raises those in the bio, we take the case anyway,

1 we are duty-bound to decide every one of those 15 

2 grounds? 

3  MR. FISHER: You're not duty-bound to decide 

4 it, Justice Alito. But I do think under this Court's 

precedent, at least, you have never reversed the 

6 decision below without reaching them. So you may well 

7 affirm on the question presented or some one or two of 

8 those questions. You may also dismiss the case as 

9 improvidently granted, which happens sometimes in these 

circumstances. Of course, what ordinarily what would 

11 happen is when the cert -- when the ops was filed this 

12 Court would realize there was a serious obstacle to 

13 reaching the question and might well deny cert in the 

14 first place. But as I said, there's no decision on this 

Court's books and certainly the Solicitor General hasn't 

16 appointed one where you've reversed and reinstated a 

17 conviction or, in fact, reversed and done anything to a 

18 Respondent in these circumstances. 

19  Now, let me turn to the merits of the ten 

day argument and make a few points before I'm sure the 

21 Court might want to talk about the pretrial motions 

22 issue as well. There's a few important points to make. 

23 Now, remember, the Solicitor General has now basically 

24 abandoned the Sixth Circuit's view that Rule 45 

automatically gets incorporated into the Speedy Trial 

29

1 Act and now they're making the making the argument that 

2 what Congress intended in the Speedy Trial Act was 

3 somehow for Rule 45 to operate as some background 

4 principle. So that the meaning of the Act, I guess, 

would wax and wane according to what Rule 45 said. Now, 

6 there's two versions of this argument. I can't tell 

7 which it's making. First it could be saying that what 

8 Congress meant when it passed subsection F in 1979 was 

9 that whatever the rule is in Rule 45 right now, that's 

what we expect to be applied. Well, that can't possibly 

11 be the Solicitor General's argument because in 1979 Rule 

12 45, consistent with the traditional rule, excluded 

13 weekends and holidays only for periods of less than 

14 seven days. That wasn't changed until 1985. So the 

Congress at the time, even if they had cared about Rule 

16 45, wouldn't have, wouldn't have thought you counted, 

17 excluded weekends and holidays here. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why wouldn't Congress 

19 think, we have a bunch of statutes that have times and 

we have a bunch that don't and the ones that don't, they 

21 should be interpreted into the Federal rule, that Rule 

22 45? 

23  MR. FISHER: I think the much more natural 

24 reading, Justice Ginsburg, in light of the traditional 

rule, which is not just cited in Am. Jur., please 

30

1 understand, this is a cannon of common law, traditional 

2 construction of time periods that goes back to 

3 Sutherland's treatise in 1904. There's a Second Circuit 

4 case called Morasca in 1921, 277 F.2727, I could cite 

you 20 or 30 state cases all up and down the last 

6 century. So the common law rule has always been for 

7 periods of less than seven days -- I'm sorry, for 

8 periods of more than seven days, it's up to the 

9 legislature to expressly tell the court to exclude 

weekends and holidays. And if you look at the U.S. 

11 Code, it's perfectly consistent with that common law 

12 understanding because when Congress wanted, such as in 

13 the Bail Reform Act, to exclude weekends and holidays 

14 from a ten day period, it expressly says so. Now, we 

cited three or four examples in our brief. Again, this 

16 is at page 40, 41 of our brief. I could have cited 15 

17 or 20. So the U.S. Code is quite clear and I think the 

18 much more natural inference its that when Congress 

19 wanted to exclude weekends and holidays consistent with 

the traditional rule, it felt duty bound to say so in 

21 the U.S. Code, and when it hasn't, it wants simply 

22 calendar days -- now, if you want confirmation. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Under the 2009 amendment, 

24 Rule 45 includes statutes it didn't before and now it 

does?

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1  MR. FISHER: It does now, but two things are 

2 telling about the 2009 amendments. The first is that 

3 when it switched to statutes, it reverted to counting 

4 calendar days.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're not relying on the 

6 2009 -足

7  MR. FISHER: No. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't say -- you say 

9 this was wrong when it was decided?

 MR. FISHER: Yes. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Regardless of the 2009? 

12  MR. FISHER: That's right, that's right. 

13 But if you want to talk about Congressional intent, I 

14 don't think we have to even go there. But, remember, 

after the -- in 2009 there's also a Federal law, the 

16 Technical Amendments Statutory Act made a hash of that. 

17 But Congress went through, most recently about a year 

18 and a half ago, and amended various provisions of the 

19 U.S. Code according to whether it wanted weekends or 

holidays excluded or times enlarged, and it left this 

21 alone. So I think every indicia of evidence you can 

22 look at from every possible angle shows that ten days 

23 meant ten days at the time of the trial, and that's not 

24 to affirm the judgment.

 The last point I'll make concerning -足

1  JUSTICE ALITO: Congress thought about the 

2 Speedy Trial Act when it made those technical 

3 amendments, isn't it likely to have thought the courts 

4 had interpreted it as excluding the weekends up to that 

point? 

6  MR. FISHER: No, my point, Justice Alito, is 

7 Congress didn't think of the Speedy Trial Act, it didn't 

8 do anything with the Speedy Trial Act. 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: Didn't think about -- okay.

 MR. FISHER: Well, maybe we leave that where 

11 it was, but let me make one final point that I think is 

12 the clincher here. Remember, we have not just this 

13 alternative argument, we have a second alternative 

14 argument, which is that the time in relation to Mr. 

Tinklenberg's competency hearing exceeded the 30 day 

16 provision in section 4247 in the Insanity Defense Reform 

17 Act. Now, I don't think you have to get to that 

18 argument, you can simply affirm on the ten day issue, 

19 but, again, let's think about what the Solicitor General 

is arguing with respect to the ten day issue. They're 

21 saying that Congress sub silentio, without saying 

22 anything at all in the Speedy Trial Act, somehow assumed 

23 that the time in subsection F would wax and wane 

24 according to this rule. Well, if that's -- even though 

the rule didn't even apply to statutes at the time.

1 Well, if that's the case, then I don't think there's any 

2 basis for arguing that Congress would have had exactly 

3 the same assumption with respect to another Federal 

4 statute, that is the Insanity Defense Reform Act.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if we don't 

6 agree with you on your Rule 45 argument, you say we 

7 would have to reach this third argument, right? 

8  MR. FISHER: Yes. So I think the only 

9 way -- somehow, you've accepted the Solicitor General's 

argument, which I don't think you can, but if you did 

11 accept it on merits, it runs headlong into our third 

12 argument, which the Solicitor General takes exactly the 

13 opposite position, which is, the Speedy Trial Act is its 

14 own self-contained universe that doesn't incorporate any 

other statutes or any other provisions of law. 

16  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why aren't they 

17 trying -- why isn't the effect of what you're doing to 

18 prompt us to dismiss this case that the petitioner has 

19 improvidently granted? If we were to write an opinion 

that says that the -- the Sixth Circuit was wrong in its 

21 interpretation of subsection (f), and therefore, we're 

22 not going to get to -- and anything we then had to say 

23 about subsection (d) is just dictum, and that's the 

24 issue that we took the case to decide, why should we 

keep the case at all?

3  MR. FISHER: I think you could do that, 

4 Justice Ginsburg. I think you could decide based on my 

discussion of the Zabawa case. There's another case 

6 that postdates the rule 45 amendments, called Clifton, 

7 out of the Southern District of Mississippi. So you 

8 might decide that there's enough of an ongoing question 

9 here to write an opinion. You could do either one.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you would have 

11 to -- we would have to wait for another case to decide 

12 this issue, one which is a split, that is, the delay 

13 resulting from. What does that mean?

19 it to this Court's best discretion how it wants to 

handle that issue. 

21  Now, Justice Kennedy, let me turn to the 

22 merits. 

23  We think this is a straightforward case 

24 where the text dictates the outcome of the case. 

Remember, the key words in the statute are "delay

1 resulting from," and I think the -- I think the ordinary 

2 meaning, in fact, the only meaning, of "delay" is a 

3 hindrance to progress or a postponement. So it's -足

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry to 

interrupt you so early, but what about Justice 

6 Ginsburg's point, which I understood to be there's 

7 always delay resulting from these pretrial motions; it's 

8 just that the district judge takes that into account, 

9 says, well, I'm going to have a lot of the usual 

pretrial motions, so I'm going to set the trial date at 

11 this point. 

12  So that is delay, when the trial date might 

13 otherwise have been set, resulting from these pretrial 

14 motions, and then the -- the statute goes on to tell you 

how you count that delay. 

16  MR. FISHER: That's exactly our argument, 

17 Mr. Chief Justice. Our argument is there's two ways you 

18 can have delay: One is by the trial date simply being 

19 moved to accommodate the motion. The other -- and this 

is where we agree with what the Solicitor General said 

21 here today, as well as at page 38-39 of his opening 

22 brief -- delay can also, in the ordinary English 

23 language, mean that the trial date was originally set to 

24 accommodate the motions in the way you just described. 

But what the Solicitor General is arguing for is

1 something much more dramatic than that. They are 

2 arguing for an exclusion of the time, even if trial date 

3 was set irregardless of the motions -足

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How would you ever know 

that? How would we ever know that, Mr. Fisher? A trial 

6 judge that has had a lot of criminal cases knows that 

7 there's going to be some motions as you get closer to 

8 trial, but how would we know whether the judge -- this 

9 particular judge took into account the likelihood of 

motions in setting the trial date or didn't? 

11  MR. FISHER: Well, ordinarily, Justice 

12 Ginsburg -- remember, this is only a small subset of 

13 cases. But in those cases, ordinarily, I would think 

14 the trial judge would say on the record when the date is 

set. Now, if it's -- if there's motion practice before 

16 there's any date that's ever set, the NACDL brief, I 

17 think, explains how that works in the district in the 

18 Sixth Circuit right now. Parties often stipulate or are 

19 asked to stipulate by the court. Common sense goes a 

long way in this scenario, Justice Ginsburg. It's 

21 obvious. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- why would the

3  MR. FISHER: Defendants don't always benefit 

4 from the clock running, Justice Ginsburg. I think 

there's two reasons why they might stipulate. One is 

6 because it might simply be obvious that the motion is of 

7 sufficient weight and difficulty that it's going to 

8 consume the court's resources, so why argue something 

9 that wouldn't have a basis to begin with?

 But I think the NACDL brief is forthright in 

11 saying, at least at the beginning of criminal cases, 

12 often defendants find themselves wanting more time, and 

13 so, again, they don't have the incentive to argue 

14 against that.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How do you reconcile your 

16 argument with the situation in which the motion is 

17 pending for 30 days, so that's the period from the 

18 filing until the prompt disposition, and as a result of 

19 that motion, the trial judge says this has caused -足

this is going to force me, this is going to result in 10 

21 days' delay in the date on which the case can begin, so 

22 the trial date is pushed back 10 days? Now, in that 

23 situation, how much time is excluded? 

24  MR. FISHER: I think the -- the text of the 

statute allows you to say either 30 or 10. I think in

1 light of this Court's Henderson decision -- and perhaps 

2 I think Congress had administrability concerns in mind 

3 with that last clause -- I think 30 days could be 

4 excluded. But if you disagree with me on that and you 

want to have a rigid textual reading of the statute 

6 resulting from only meaning 10 days, I think that's your 

7 only other option. 

8  Because, if I could ask the Court, or at 

9 least direct the Court to page 6 of the Solicitor 

General's reply brief, this is where they give -足

11 because I think what the government wants to do is pose 

12 these difficult hypotheticals, and the sort of difficult 

13 question you just raised, Justice Alito, and have this 

14 Court respond by saying, oh, we're just going to throw 

the words "delay resulting from" out of the statute. 

16 Because there's only two definitions, two ways to deal 

17 with what the Solicitor General offers. 

18  First, they say that delay means time, and I 

19 think ordinary -- in ordinary English language, "delay" 

means something more than time. It means postponement. 

21 So then the fallback argument -- this is the second 

22 paragraph on page 6 -- is that the occurrence that is 

23 postponed is the STA's deadline for commencing trial, 

24 and our suggestion is that that begs the whole question. 

That can't possibly be right, because the whole reason

1 that you're looking to subsection (d) to apply it is to 

2 ask whether you should exclude the time. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me, but isn't 

4 that what the statute says? Meaning, if you look at 

(h), the beginning paragraph at (h), it says, "The 

6 following periods of delay shall be excluded in 

7 computing the time within which the trial of any such 

8 offense must commence." 

9  It's not talking about the delay of the 

trial. It's talking about the computation of the start 

11 date for the trial. So if that's what that commands you 

12 to do, doesn't -- isn't only the Solicitor General's 

13 position consistent with that? It's telling you to take 

14 the periods of delay and compute the date the trial must 

start by excluding those. That's the language. 

16  MR. FISHER: I think for two reasons, I 

17 would disagree, respectfully, Justice Sotomayor. First 

18 is, I take that language to say that we're going to now 

19 tell you all the circumstances under which you exclude 

time, and so if any of these subsections are satisfied, 

21 you exclude the time. But the -足

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the -足

23  MR. FISHER: -- Solicitor General's argument 

24 is that you start from the premise. "Delay resulting 

from" means you've already excluded the time. That's 

40

1 the premise. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but that's what 

3 (h) says; (h) says you compute the start date of the 

4 trial, when it must start, by excluding all of these 

periods of delay. It's defining it for you. 

6  MR. FISHER: Well, if -- if there was delay. 

7 Maybe another example, Justice Sotomayor. In 

8 subsection 7, which is at (4)(a) of the government's 

9 appendix, I think is another way of showing that it 

can't possibly -- even if it weren't begging the 

11 question, it can't possibly be right. It has to be 

12 talking about the trial itself, because this is the 

13 continuance -- the end of the justice continuance 

14 section. And it says, "Any period of delay resulting 

from a continuance granted by a judge on his own 

16 motion," and blah, blah, blah, "if certain criteria are 

17 met." 

18  Now, it's very clear that in that section, 

19 "period" -- "period of delay resulting from" can't mean 

that we've already said that the clock is stopped, 

21 because there's an "if" clause that gives you certain 

22 things that have to be satisfied in order to exclude it. 

23 So I think starting with the very title of the Act we're 

24 talking about, the Speedy Trial Act, and the -- the idea 

of the words "delay resulting from" can only sensibly 

41

1 mean delay resulting from trial. 

2  And so I think the definition that we've 

3 given you again, which is, delay results from a trial if 

4 the trial itself is postponed, or if the trial is set in 

a way that accommodates the motion, is the only way to 

6 give meaning to the operative words in the statute. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it doesn't matter how 

8 substantial and important a motion is, whether it was 

9 your motion to dismiss for Speedy Trial Act reasons or 

the administrative motions here that you say really 

11 didn't require time? It doesn't matter; all that 

12 matters is keeping track from day one, the commencement 

13 of the trial, as to when the Court is about to set the 

14 trial date, that it does it at the end of all the 

motions. That's the only time the court can do it. 

16  MR. FISHER: The distinction between 

17 administrative and nonadministrative motions, I think, 

18 doesn't matter in this case because trial wasn't -足

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why wouldn't it matter?

 MR. FISHER: Well, it would matter, I think, 

21 Justice Sotomayor, in a circumstance where the trial 

22 date hadn't been set yet and then was set, and an 

23 argument might arise -- well, I think we've had this 

24 dialogue already to some degree. I didn't -- I expected 

these kinds of motions to be filed. I knew there was

1 going to be a suppression hearing. We had the whole -足

2 therefore, I set the trial out. That would seem to be 

3 saying this was a nonadministrative matter that I had to 

4 accommodate. I don't think a trial judge -- put another 

way, I don't think a trial judge could say I'm setting 

6 trial date outside the 70-day deadline because I had to 

7 sign my name to that pro haec vice motion. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, actually it 

9 happens all the time. In the "rocket docket" in 

Virginia, the court sets a trial date, and you file 

11 whatever motions you're going to file. Under your 

12 theory, until that last motion actually delays the trial 

13 date, none of those motions exclude time. 

14  MR. FISHER: That may well be correct, but I 

don't know why it would matter, because it doesn't 

16 matter until you get outside of the 70 days to begin 

17 with. So -足

18  JUSTICE BREYER: It matters because the 

19 trial judges have to know what to do, and while your 

reading might fit the language in ordinary English 

21 better, I think it does. 

22  It's also possible to read those words 

23 "delay resulting from" as simply referring to a period 

24 of time; and the statute is saying these periods of time 

are excluded from accounting. Now, the virtue of that 

43

1 is just what Justice Ginsburg started with; all the 

2 trial judges know how to do it; the lawyers don't get 

3 mixed up; and the problem with what you're arguing for, 

4 in my mind -- if you want to say anything more about it, 

do -- is that it seems very unworkable to strike trying 

6 to figure out what causes what. 

7  MR. FISHER: Let me say a couple things, 

8 Justice Breyer. First, with all due respect, I have to 

9 disagree with your premise that it's possible to read 

the statute the way the Solicitor General wants to read 

11 it. Now I'll accept for purposes of responding to your 

12 question, let's imagine that it were possible to read it 

13 that way. I think our rule is not as difficult to 

14 administer as you think it might be in the -- NACDL 

brief LDY. And indeed the Solicitor General -- this has 

16 been the -- this has been the law in -- in the Sixth 

17 Circuit for 17 months. They haven't pointed to a single 

18 dismissal as a result of it. 

19  Now let me take the other side, and this 

brings us to the dialogue during Mr. Roberts' argument; 

21 the Solicitor General's rule isn't so easy, either, 

22 unless you simply cease caring at all about the Act. 

23 You could have a perfectly administrable rule that says 

24 every singly motion, no matter what the circumstances, 

tolls the clock. 

44

1  But that's not the law in the First Circuit, 

2 for example. They're made clear as Justice Sotomayor 

3 said that if a motion is filed to frustrate the speedy 

4 trial clock, then we're not going to exclude it; and 

that makes perfect sense. I mean, look at this case. 

6 And I'm not going to suggest there was any ill will or 

7 bad faith in this case; but the facts of the case 

8 illustrate the problem. 

9  On August 1st, trial date was set for August 

14th. There were 14 days before the trial was going to 

11 happen. Yet there were only -- even under the best 

12 reading there were only 10 days left on the clock. So 

13 if no motions had been filed, unquestionably we would 

14 have a Speedy Trial Act violation. So the government's 

whole case hinges on the fact that because it filed this 

16 purely administrative motion to bring a gun into the 

17 courtroom, a motion I might add that at the pretrial 

18 conference the judge had already told the government was 

19 going to be granted, and so I don't know why it couldn't 

have been made at the moment the evidence was 

21 introduced; and one other administration motion, then 

22 the Speedy Trial Act isn't violated. 

23  And to borrow the Solicitor General's own 

24 phrase from page 38 of his brief, that outcome bears no 

relation to the Act's purpose. So what you have to do 

45

1 to have, I think, the government's argument be at all 

2 faithful, even if it were possible under the language -足

3 have it be at all faithful with the purpose of the Act, 

4 is to have some kind of exception for motions that 

frustrate, motions that are pretextual, motions that are 

6 purely administrative, however it would be defined. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why do you think that -足

8  MR. FISHER: And you walk in -足

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- your motion -- I mean, 

the government had administrative motions, but you had a 

11 Speedy Trial Act motion; and you say that doesn't count, 

12 either? 

13  MR. FISHER: I -- well, two things, Justice 

14 Ginsburg. First of all, we're not relying in this Court 

on the Speedy Trial Act motion to get us to the Speedy 

16 Trial Act violation. The two motions the government 

17 filed get you to the 70 days, and so we haven't made an 

18 argument with respect to the Speedy Trial Act. But if 

19 we had to, the argument would be -- with regard to that 

motion, would be that it didn't delay trial. Trial had 

21 already been set, the Court said this is when we're 

22 going to trial; trial wasn't moved, and we all went to 

23 trial. And so -足

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I don't believe 

I had a trial in my district court days where between

1 the time I had the pretrial conference and the time 

2 trial started, there wasn't a slew of motions, because 

3 that's about the time counsel tends to wake up. 

4  MR. FISHER: Yes.

 (Laughter.) 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay? And -- and decide 

7 that really now they've got to get ready. 

8  MR. FISHER: Yes. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why should we care 

whether it's an administrative motion or simply to 

11 clarify the functioning of the trial? Why should we not 

12 exclude those times, because those -- those motions, 

13 whether they're administrative or not, will cause the 

14 trial to go faster, because issues that would otherwise 

consume the time of the court during trial are being 

16 resolved before trial. 

17  MR. FISHER: I think that might be an 

18 argument for writing the Speedy Trial Act a different 

19 way, Justice Sotomayor; but if the question is whether 

the motion delayed trial -- and that's the question that 

21 the Speedy Trial Act requires the judge to ask and 

22 answer -- then the administrative piece of paper going 

23 across the judge's desk when the judge knows ahead of 

24 time it isn't going to cause any difficult, simply 

doesn't delay trial.

1  At page, I believe it's 5 or 6 of the NACDL 

2 brief, they talk about pretrial conferences. And they 

3 say what happens in the Sixth Circuit right now is the 

4 judge holds the conference; as you say, counsel wakes 

up; and everybody -- and the judge says tell me the 

6 motions you're going to file. And the counsel from both 

7 sides tell the judge what motions are going to be filed, 

8 and they discuss right then and there whether they're 

9 going to delay -- whether they're going to cause some 

delay for trial. And so -足

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Fisher -- delay, you 

12 make an argument about the meaning of delay. I am 

13 troubled by the meaning of the "from the filing of the 

14 motion" of that clause. You read that, I think, to mean 

delay resulting from any pretrial moment and not to 

16 exceed -- right -- the peered of the filing of the 

17 filing of the motion to the conclusion of the hearing. 

18 Right? Isn't that right? 

19  MR. FISHER: I think that's right, and I 

think that's -足

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, where do you -- where 

22 to you get that "not to exceed"? It doesn't say not to 

23 exceed; it says delay resulting from the filing of the 

24 motion.

 MR. FISHER: I think the difficulty is with 

48

1 the word "from," Justice Scalia. I think it's a tough 

2 word to know exactly what transition is taking place 

3 there, but in this Court's Bloate decision, last term, I 

4 think -- what I'm -- the argument I'm making is 

perfectly consistent with that decision, where it said 

6 the "from clause" is sort of the boundaries on when 

7 subsection D applies. If you're talking about delay 

8 that a motion caused either after the hearing or before 

9 the filing, we don't want to hear from you. But the 

from clause tells you if the delay falls within those 

11 two goalposts, then it's excludable. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a funny way to say it. 

13 It's a funny way to say it. 

14  MR. FISHER: I don't think it's a perfect 

way to say it, either, Justice Scalia. And I said -- in 

16 my dialogue with Justice Alito, I think that you could 

17 also say, especially with a little bit of pushing on 

18 Henderson, that "resulting from" actually gives you a 

19 specific time period in between those that you have to 

exclude. But I think that that's the best reading of 

21 the Act, and again, it's the only one that gives -- that 

22 gives meaning to the phrase delay resulting from. 

23  If I might just say one or two words to 

24 circle back to where I began, Mr. Tinklenberg urges you 

to affirm the Sixth Circuit decision or to dismiss this

respect, the 10-day argument that we preserved in our

16  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS 

17  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

18  MR. ROBERTS: Thank you, Your Honor. 

19  First I would like to stress that the 

government thinks that it's very important that the 

21 Court address the question that we raised in our cert 

22 petition, and that the Court granted certiorari to 

23 answer, on which there's a split in the circuits and 

24 which we believe that if it's left standing will result 

in serious disruption to the Speedy Trial Act.

1  Turning to -- to that question, a few points 

2 first. Respondent's definition of delay is plainly 

3 inconsistent with Henderson which already holds that the 

4 period of delay that's excludable is the time between 

the filing of the motion and the disposition of the 

6 motion. That can't be squared with the notion that 

7 delay is the period during which trial is postponed. 

8  Second, Respondent's definition of delay 

9 gives delay a different meaning in the first part of the 

statute and in subsection D, where this Court's already 

11 held that it has the meaning that we suggest. 

12  Third, Respondent's test is totally 

13 unworkable, because you can't tell at the time a motion 

14 is filed how much time it's going to take to resolve and 

whether trial is going to be postponed. District Court 

16 judges have over 500 pending cases on their docket, an 

17 average District Court judge. A hundred of them are 

18 criminal. The court -- the Speedy Trial Act cannot 

19 function if the judges are going to have to make a 

complex judicial determination in each case to determine 

21 whether each motion is excludable. 

22  Respondent says that NACDL says defendants 

23 won't object or that they'll stipulate to the exclusion 

24 of time, but NACDL also says that defendants may change 

their mind if the case goes to trial, and if they change

1 their mind and file a motion to dismiss under the Speedy 

2 Trial Act, their prior failures to object and 

3 stipulations may very well not be binding because this 

4 Court held in Zedner that defendants can prospectively 

waive the application of the Act. And Respondent's 

6 tests would also throw the established way that the 

7 Speedy Trial Act has been operating for over 30 years 

8 into disarray. 

9  Turning to whether this Court has to address 

the alternative arguments for affirmance, Nobles plainly 

11 says that the Court has discretion not to address those 

12 issues if those issues are not independently worthy of 

13 certiorari. It doesn't base that on the fact that 

14 the -- on the fact that the argument would expand the 

judgment below, and the rule that it's discretionary 

16 makes sense, because the contrary rule would require the 

17 court to address numerous issues that are not important 

18 and -- in every case where they're raised, and would 

19 also lead the court to either dismiss writs as 

improvidently granted or to address only as dicta 

21 important issues on which the Court has granted 

22 certiorari.

2  MR. ROBERTS: Yes, I think that we would

think that the courts of appeals would follow it even if 

6 it might technically be viewed as dicta. We would think 

7 that it would be an alternative holding or ratio
