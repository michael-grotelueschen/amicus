3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 first this morning in Case 09-958,

5 Douglas v. Independent Living Center of Southern

6 California, and the consolidated cases.

7             Ms. Schwartz.

8            ORAL ARGUMENT OF KARIN S. SCHWARTZ

9               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10             MS. SCHWARTZ:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11 please the Court:

12             There are many reasons why this Court should

13 not recognize a private cause of action to enforce

14 30(A), and I'd like to focus on three.  First is

15 separation of powers.  Congress controls who can enforce

16 Federal law, and it has not provided for -- for private

17 enforcement of 30(A).  Instead, it has provided for

18 administrative enforcement.

19             Second is the Spending Clause context in

20 which the case arises.  The very legitimacy of Spending

21 Clause legislation depends on the States' voluntary and

22 knowing acceptance of its obligations.  For this reason,

23 if Congress wants to provide for private party

24 litigation, it must do so clear and unambiguously, and

25 it has not done so in this case.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

5

1             And third is the language of 30(A) itself,

2 which is broad and undefined and which includes

3 competing policy interests.  These are suited to

4 administrative enforcement, with all the expertise and

5 judgment and discretion and administrative know-how that

6 can be brought to bear.

7             These three principles all focus -- all

8 point to one conclusion -- that section 30(A) is not

9 enforceable.

10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Schwartz, the

11 government doesn't have the injunctive power -- as far

12 as California's rates are concerned, California puts

13 them into effect.  The government can't stop that from

14 happening, even if the government thinks that they are

15 in violation of the Medicaid Act; is that right?

16             MS. SCHWARTZ:  No, Your Honor, it -- it is

17 not.  I mean, in the sense that it can't go out

18 immediately and get an injunction, Your Honor is

19 correct.  However, the government has the power to deny

20 a State --

21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes, but that's a very

22 drastic remedy, and it's going to hurt the people that

23 Medicaid was meant to benefit.  Does the government have

24 any injunctive power, or is its only -- only remedy a

25 fund cutoff?



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

6

1             MS. SCHWARTZ:  Well, its only remedy

2 provided by statute is to terminate funds.  However, it

3 is not a drastic remedy; it -- and it is the remedy

4 that's provided --

5             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How often has it

6 happened?

7             MS. SCHWARTZ:  How often does it happen?

8             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How -- how often has in

9 the Medicaid context --

10             MS. SCHWARTZ:  Very rarely, and the reason

11 for that is because the way that most State plan

12 amendments operate is that these issues are resolved on

13 a consensual basis, generally within the 90 days

14 provided by regulation.  This case is the exception that

15 proves the rule.

16             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Ms. Schwartz, isn't it

17 the exception because in fact you end-run -- end-ran the

18 administrative process, that you put your regulations,

19 your new rate schedules, into effect even before you

20 submitted them to HHS, and continued them in effect

21 while HHS was considering them, and continued them in

22 effect to the extent that you were allowed to do so by

23 injunction, even after HHS disapproved them?

24             MS. SCHWARTZ:  There is no end run here

25 because HHS's own regulations provide that our time for



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

7

1 submitting a State -- State plan amendment is within the

2 90 days that the amendment will take effect, and HHS

3 will confirm that -- this is the position of the Federal

4 Government that the State may implement its rate

5 reductions while the State plan amendment is pending.

6 It does so at the risk that, if a State plan amendment

7 is disapproved, that it may have to pay additional

8 funds.  But we did not do an end run around anything.

9 We are entirely consistent with the administrative

10 process.

11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could a State in its own

12 courts provide for procedures whereby adversely affected

13 parties could test the regulation?

14             MS. SCHWARTZ:  I don't believe so.  And

15 that's because in --

16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me you have to

17 say that.  Otherwise the next question would be under

18 Gonzaga, you wouldn't say that a State can entertain a

19 monetary cause of action.  So, I think that's consistent

20 with your position.

21             MS. SCHWARTZ:  Well, and I think what's very

22 important to focus on here is that this is not just any

23 Federal statute that's being enforced, but it is a

24 Spending Clause provision that is vague and ambiguous in

25 its terms.  It cries -- it has all these policy elements



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

8

1 to it, and it cries out for administrative review.

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, when you say -- that

3 brings me to a slightly different point.  You -- you

4 introduce the fact or the consideration of what's

5 administratively workable.  The brief by the former HHS

6 officials says quite to the contrary.  It -- it says

7 that there are almost $400 billion of HHS expenditures

8 that are supervised by 50 people.  That works out to 800

9 million each; and they say, we don't have time for this.

10 And it's much more efficient and it's much more

11 consistent with the application of -- proper application

12 of Federal law to allow this action to be brought in the

13 -- in the courts.

14             MS. SCHWARTZ:  I have two answers, Your

15 Honor.  One is that I don't think it is more efficient

16 to have 700 district court judges interpreting a statute

17 that does not have any objective standard but that is

18 susceptible to many different interpretations.

19             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, Ms. Schwartz, the

20 agency --

21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I mean, that's "the

22 sky is falling" -- 700 judges.  It would be just each

23 district if it were in every district.  And it -- it --

24 and certainly to the extent we are involving a State,

25 there would be only one State involved.  So -- so, there



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

9

1 is just the State of California, and there are only four

2 districts there, and the suit could only be brought in

3 one.  So, I -- I think that's an -- you know, I don't

4 think that the "sky is falling" argument really works.

5             MS. SCHWARTZ:  But California is now subject

6 to standards that don't apply anywhere else in the

7 country, and I believe the Court acknowledged exactly

8 this problem just last term in Astra v. Santa Clara when

9 it declined to allow private parties to use a contract

10 provision to do an end run around Gonzaga,

11 Sandoval versus -- Sandoval v. Alexander; I think I have

12 that reversed -- and the other cases that, based on

13 separation of powers of principles, based on Spending

14 Clause principles, limit the -- the circumstances in

15 which private parties can sue.

16             JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you asking us to adopt a

17 rule that is good for this one case only?

18             MS. SCHWARTZ:  A --

19             JUSTICE ALITO:  You gave -- or is there --

20 could you state the rule in broader terms or more

21 neutral terms?

22             And you gave three reasons why we should

23 reverse.  One, Congress hasn't created a cause of action

24 here.  Well, Congress has never created causes of

25 action, never creates a cause of action in any case in



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

10

1 the Ex parte Young line or cases like that.

2             The Supremacy Clause, because this is a

3 Spending Clause -- this was an act under the Spending

4 Clause.  But you're not asking us to hold that Spending

5 Clause legislation can never pre-empt State legislation,

6 I take it.

7             And then the language of 30(A), where you --

8 are you arguing that 30 -- that the Medicaid Act

9 affirmatively precludes any action like this?  I don't

10 understand that -- is -- is any of those arguments

11 sufficient by itself, or do you have to take them all

12 together, and you're asking for a rule that only applies

13 here?

14             MS. SCHWARTZ:  No, all of the -- all of

15 those arguments are sufficient, as is the fact that, as

16 we briefed, the Supremacy Cause itself doesn't supply a

17 cause of action.  But let me focus on those three

18 points.

19             These are points -- the rule that we are

20 seeking is that a Federal statute is not enforceable

21 unless Congress intends for it to be enforceable and

22 that that principle has special force with respect to

23 Spending Clause provisions where Congress has to clearly

24 and unambiguously provide for that enforcement, because

25 the State has to be on fair notice, due to the nature of



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

11

1 the Spending Clause, of the obligations to which it is

2 agreeing.  That is Pennhurst.  And that is applied with

3 even greater force with respect to 30(A) because of the

4 type of standards that it incorporates.

5             If it's not suitable for -- if the

6 determination applying Gonzaga is that you're -- if

7 you're finding under 1983 the administrative nature and

8 flexible nature of those standards is not appropriate

9 for private enforcement, that shouldn't matter what

10 vehicle you are using to bring the case.

11             And I want to just -- to put this into real

12 clear context.  In the 3 years that this case has been

13 pending, California has submitted 68 State plan

14 amendments outside of the rate context.  Thirty-six of

15 them were approved.  The rest were withdrawn

16 voluntarily.  These cases -- and they were all approved,

17 almost all of them, within the 90-day period.  So,

18 the --

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me.  Were

20 those --

21             MS. SCHWARTZ:  -- administrative process

22 works.

23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Were those amendments

24 submitted before they took effect or after they had

25 taken affect, like here?



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

12

1             MS. SCHWARTZ:  I don't know the answer to

2 that question.  These are non-rate -- rate-related

3 amendments, State plan amendments.  But the point is the

4 administrative process is working.  We obtained -- and

5 it resolves, in the usual case, in a consensual

6 resolution that is consistent with the cooperative

7 nature of the joint venture between --

8             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm --

9             MS. SCHWARTZ:  -- the States and the Federal

10 Government.

11             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's where I'm a

12 little bit confused.  The injunction here only stopped

13 you from implementing the rate changes until you got

14 approval from HHS in its administrative process that it

15 was going to approve the amendment, correct?

16             MS. SCHWARTZ:  No, I don't believe the

17 injunctions were that limited.  And so, if we obtained

18 State plan approval, we then would have to go back to

19 the courts and argue over what the impact is of -- of

20 the State plan.

21             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's a separate

22 question about whether the courts are required to give

23 deference to an HHS finding.  But the injunction here

24 wasn't one that said you could never do this.  It just

25 said go finish the process, right?



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

13

1             MS. SCHWARTZ:  No, the injunctions were not

2 so conditional.  And the -- and the point I want to make

3 is the injunctions have disrupted the administrative

4 process as it is intended to work by drawing out the

5 process, by politicizing the process, by prejudicing our

6 ability to get State plan approval because now there's

7 the concern about what about retroactive relief if we

8 approve your State plan --

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, the courts, I take

10 it, have the prerogative, perhaps even the obligation,

11 under the primary jurisdiction rationale to simply

12 withhold adjudication until the agency acts.

13             MS. SCHWARTZ:  And we requested that in some

14 of these cases, and the courts ignored that argument.

15 And so, the upshot is that we are now --

16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's an abuse of

17 discretion, not an absence of power.  You're arguing an

18 absence of power.

19             MS. SCHWARTZ:  Well, there is no cause of

20 action.  That's correct, Your Honor.  Our position is

21 that there is no cause of action here.

22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, can I go back to the

23 question that Justice Alito asked you about why there's

24 no cause of action?  You are asking us to treat the

25 Supremacy Clause differently from every other



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

14

1 constitutional provision.  Why should we?

2             MS. SCHWARTZ:  Well, for several reasons,

3 Your Honor.  First, when -- what you're doing here, what

4 the Court is doing here, is enforcing a Federal statute.

5 You look through the Supremacy Clause to the

6 obligations that --

7             JUSTICE KAGAN:  The Supremacy Clause is part

8 of the Constitution.

9             MS. SCHWARTZ:  It is.

10             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And the Petitioners here --

11 excuse me.  The -- the plaintiffs here essentially said

12 that the Supremacy Clause as part of the Constitution

13 had been violated and sought, not damages, but only a

14 prospective injunction.  And the question is, why the

15 court shouldn't do what the court has done many, many,

16 many times before, tens and tens and tens of times

17 before, and say, yes, that's our prerogative and we'll

18 proceed to the merits?

19             MS. SCHWARTZ:  Two points, Your Honor.

20 First, they did seek damages, and they obtained damages

21 in Independent Living.  And second is the obligations

22 that are imposed, the study requirement, the data

23 requirement, all these obligations are imposed by 30(A).

24 You look through the Supremacy Clause to the statute to

25 see the obligations.  And so, the question is, does



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

15

1 Congress get to control who enforces those obligations

2 or not?

3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  In a -- in a cause of -- in

4 a suit that's brought under a statute directly, a person

5 could be claiming damages.  Here that is not the case.

6 A person is only claiming injunctive relief.  And that

7 should -- there should be a difference between those two

8 in terms of when the cause of action is available.

9             MS. SCHWARTZ:  First, just one point:  In

10 Independent Living, they did claim damages, and they

11 obtained damages.  But setting that issue aside, no,

12 Your Honor, this Court has -- has the obligation and the

13 right with respect to constitutional provisions to

14 determine how they will be enforced, subject potentially

15 to congressional action, but there is far more latitude

16 for the Court.  With respect to statutes, of course, as

17 this Court is explained in Davis v. Passman, deference

18 to congressional intent is appropriate.  And here --

19             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose the plaintiffs

20 here were facing an imminent State enforcement action.

21 Would your argument be different?

22             MS. SCHWARTZ:  Well, if -- if the plaintiffs

23 fell within -- yes.  And if the plaintiffs fell within

24 the bill in equity to restrain enforcement proceedings

25 that was at issue in Ex parte Young and that Justice



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

16

1 Kennedy has discussed in terms of the immunity to

2 invalid regulation, then the result would be different.

3 But there are several reasons why --

4             JUSTICE ALITO:  But how does that square

5 with the argument that you made that -- relying on

6 separation of powers, the Spending Clause, and the

7 language of 30(A)?  All of those are still in play --

8             MS. SCHWARTZ:  For a couple --

9             JUSTICE ALITO:  -- in that situation.

10             MS. SCHWARTZ:  Well, for a couple of

11 different reasons.  First of all, a defense, which is

12 what you're asserting in such a case, is not a cause of

13 action.  And so, it doesn't implicate the separation of

14 powers concerns to the same degree as a stand-alone

15 cause of action to compel the State to comply with an

16 obligation owed to another entity.

17             Also, in those cases, there -- in the equity

18 cases -- equity doesn't provide a remedy just for an

19 injury.  You have to have an invasion of what in old

20 times was called a primary right.  But what that means

21 is a right to property or a right in the person.  And

22 there were other kinds of primary rights, but --

23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But what about the

24 providers who say, but under -- under the State law, if

25 we charge more than the hospitals -- if we charge more



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

17

1 than the State ceiling, we are subject to sanctions, so

2 this does fit into the category of anticipatory

3 defenses?

4             MS. SCHWARTZ:  No, it does not, because we

5 have not threatened to enforce that statute.  They are

6 not arguing that statute is -- is pre-empted.  They --

7 the -- the statute that they are --

8             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But wouldn't they be --

9 the rates go into effect.  Someone charges more on the

10 theory that the rates are impermissible under the

11 Supremacy Clause.  That person would be subject to

12 sanction under State law.

13             MS. SCHWARTZ:  And that would be a different

14 case, and it would be a closer case, although even in

15 that context, because of the Spending Clause context in

16 which the case arises, I don't believe that they would

17 be able to challenge that as -- under the Supremacy

18 Clause.

19             But that is not this case.  That case at

20 least presents the fact -- and the reason why it's a

21 closer case is because in that case there is regulation

22 and we are potentially infringing on their property.

23 However, what's the law that they are trying to assert

24 defensively there?  It is -- as a Spending Clause

25 provision that has administrative standards, that's been



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

18

1 entrusted to Congress.  So, shouldn't Congress be able

2 to enforce it?  Fundamentally, this Court --

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  You spoke of

4 that, Justice Ginsburg's question, as though it was a

5 hypothetical.  But that could happen, couldn't it?  What

6 if one of these Respondents charged more than the State

7 law permits?  Wouldn't -- wouldn't the State move

8 against them?

9             MS. SCHWARTZ:  Of course, we would, and they

10 would have a decision about whether to stay in the

11 Medicaid program or not.  But the question is, does this

12 Court exercise its equitable powers to create a cause of

13 action -- that Congress itself has not?  That's really

14 the question for this Court.

15             In the Spending Clause context with respect

16 to this kind of standard that is suited for

17 administrative standards, we submit you should not.

18             Unless there are any further questions, Your

19 Honor, I'd like to reserve our remaining time for

20 rebuttal.

24              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

25       AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

1             MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice and may it

2 please the Court:

3             Medicaid is a cooperative program between

4 the Federal Government and the States.  Congress has not

5 created a cause of action under that Act for private

6 parties to enforce particular provisions of it.

7             Nor does paragraph 30(A) confer private

8 rights that are enforceable under 1983.  Rather,

9 paragraph 30(A) is written in general terms that

10 describe the general undertaking by the State in its

11 bilateral relationship with the Federal Government.

12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Kneedler, is

13 your argument in this case limited to Spending Clause

14 legislation?

15             MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.  And what --

16             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And if it's not, could

17 you please -- you said yes, it is.

18             MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But give me the

20 theoretical foundation.  If the Supremacy Clause

21 doesn't -- I'm assuming you agree with your -- with

22 Petitioner that it doesn't provide for a cause of

23 action.

24             MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that your position?



Official

20

1             MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes.

2             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Then what gets all of

3 the cases that we've had since 1824 into this Court that

4 have granted injunctive relief on supremacy arguments?

5             MR. KNEEDLER:  I -- I think that the great

6 majority of those cases are ones in which the plaintiff

7 in the suit in equity is bringing an action anticipating

8 an action at law.  And there --

9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, but we -- we have

10 plenty that don't:  King, Townsend, Carlson.  We've had

11 many others that are not dissimilar --

12             MR. KNEEDLER:  They --

13             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- from this case.

14             MR. KNEEDLER:  I think that they -- though

15 that they do not reflect a general assumption that there

16 is a cause of action directly under the Supremacy

17 Clause, because as this Court said, the Supremacy Clause

18 is not itself a source of rights --

19             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, go back and explain

20 to me how all of those cases --

21             MR. KNEEDLER:  To -- I -- I think --

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's the theoretical?

23             MR. KNEEDLER:  I think there is -- I think

24 one has to look to an equitable cause of action, which I

25 think is the way Ex parte Young describes what was going



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

21

1 on in that -- in that way, as anticipating -- it was a

2 defense anticipating an action at law.

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So, go to your --

4 Petitioner's response to one of my colleagues, to

5 Justice Scalia, when she said yes, if these providers

6 decide to charge the old rate to their patients, the

7 State will go after them.  How is that any different

8 than the cases where we're talking about railroads

9 charging -- not charging customers more than a State

10 commands because the penalty's too high, or --

11             MR. KNEEDLER:  I --

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- or those types of

13 cases that fall into this pre-emptive category that

14 you're talking about?

15             MR. KNEEDLER:  That has not been plaintiffs'

16 theory of this case.  They have not said that we're

17 going to resort to self-help and charge more than the

18 State allows.  What they -- what they want to do is they

19 brought this suit to challenge the rates in the first

20 instance.  They are not claiming that they're going to

21 violate State law and charge more; they are simply

22 wanting to challenge the rates that the State has

23 charged.  If I could return to the --

24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you haven't

25 explained how that's theoretically different than the



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

22

1 example I just gave you.

2             MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, I think it is, and if I

3 could explain why --

4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So, all they have to do, as

5 far as the Government is concerned, is amend their

6 complaint to say:  We intend to charge higher rates than

7 the State law allows.

8             MR. KNEEDLER:  And I --

9             JUSTICE SCALIA:  And then you -- you'd agree

10 that the suit would lie.

11             MR. KNEEDLER:  I'm -- I'm not sure.  There

12 would be further questions that would arise in that

13 context.  For example, it's -- I don't know whether --

14 whether a -- whether in a prosecution under the statute

15 for charging -- that prohibits charging more than State

16 rates allow, whether you can raise as a defense in that

17 prosecution a challenge to the validity of the rates.

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, gee, we're not

19 deciding a whole lot here, then.  Just -- it's just a

20 matter of pleading that we're deciding, right?

21             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, that's why I'm saying

22 there might be a further question in -- in what you're

23 describing as to whether that would be a valid defense

24 in the State prosecution, because I can certainly

25 imagine the State saying:  We don't want our rates



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

23

1 tested in individual criminal prosecutions any more than

2 we would want them tested in affirmative --

3             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Kneedler, why should

4 this even matter so much whether there's a defense

5 available in a regulation that's brought against a

6 person or not?  In your brief, you admit that there are

7 numerous cases that don't fit within that category,

8 where the -- but where the -- where the State has acted

9 in some sense to change the behavior of the person, to

10 regulate the person, even if that person doesn't have a

11 proceeding in which to mount a defense.  And we -- this

12 Court has treated those cases in exactly the same way,

13 haven't they?

14             MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, but unexamined.  And let

15 me say, we are not challenging those cases.  And the

16 Court, we think, doesn't need to look more broadly to a

17 theory.  We are -- to -- to an all-encompassing theory.

18 We are focusing on Spending Clause legislation in a

19 particular cooperative Federal/State program --

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, you think --

21             MR. KNEEDLER:  -- under the Spending Clause.

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, you think there

23 may well be implied rights of action outside the

24 Spending Clause context.

25             MR. KNEEDLER:  I think probably the best way



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

24

1 to explain them is equitable cause of action drawing on

2 the courts' traditional equitable jurisdiction.  You

3 could call that an implied cause of action under the

4 Supremacy Clause, but I think, historically, it's been

5 described as an --

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So --

7             MR. KNEEDLER:  -- exercise of the courts'

8 equitable authority.  The court has equitable

9 discretion, and we think, because of the Spending Clause

10 nature of this legislation, it should not create a cause

11 of action --

12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, your -- your

13 answer to my earlier question was that you're not

14 arguing about that in this case.

15             MR. KNEEDLER:  Right, we are -- we are

16 focusing on --

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, the

18 Government -- the Government -- we don't have a position

19 from the Government on whether or not there is an

20 implied right of action under other constitutional

21 provisions.

22             MR. KNEEDLER:  Under --

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, outside the

24 Spending Clause context.

25             MR. KNEEDLER:  We are certainly not



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

25

1 challenging the existence of a cause of action at

2 equity.  I'm -- I'm just -- I think we would view it as

3 a cause of action in equity rather than implied under

4 the Supremacy Clause, but I think you may -- you might

5 get to the same place, but I think it is judicial

6 creation of a cause of action.  But if I could before my

7 time expires --

8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You -- you do not even

9 exclude all Spending Clause cases.  You only exclude

10 those Spending Clause cases where -- where the plaintiff

11 does not say we are -- you know, we're going to violate

12 the State law, and they're going to come after us.  So,

13 you haven't made an exception for the Spending Clause.

14             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it -- I don't think

15 there's any categorical rule because, for example, under

16 Spending Clause cases, you can have rights enforceable

17 under 1983.  Our basic point is the Spending Clause is a

18 contractual relationship between the Federal Government

19 and the State, and the Respondents here are in the

20 position of the people asserting rights as third-party

21 beneficiaries to the bilateral relationship between the

22 United States and the -- and the States.  Under standard

23 contract law principles --

24             JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Kneedler --

25             MR. KNEEDLER:  -- the third-party can sue



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

26

1 only if the parties intended him to be.

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Kneedler, this is what

3 you said in your cert stage brief:  You said, "Those

4 programs in which the drastic measure of withholding all

5 or a major portion of the Federal funding is the only

6 available remedy" -- and you are talking here about

7 Spending Clause programs, obviously -- "would be

8 generally less effective than a system that also permits

9 awards of injunctive relief in private actions."

10             MR. KNEEDLER:  Yes, and the circumstances in

11 which the Court has made that point and that we agree

12 with are often in situations where you have Title 6,

13 Title 9 instances of individual discrimination that are

14 arising under Federal programs, or where you have a

15 right under 1983 where -- where there is an enforceable

16 right that a party has and is going into court and is

17 supplementing the agency's oversight.

18             Here, under -- under paragraph 30(A), you

19 have only general standards that are really suitable for

20 administrative review, with balancing general --

21             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, can that really be the

22 difference?  I mean, do you think if 30(A) were

23 written -- were drafted as a formula, a rate schedule

24 formula, that there would be a cause of action, but

25 because 30(A) is more general in nature, that there is



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

27

1 no cause of action?  I mean, surely that's a question

2 for the merits of whether there is pre-emption or not.

3             MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I -- I don't think it's

4 just a merits question.  I think it also goes to the

5 question whether the parties to the contract intended

6 third-party beneficiary-type rights to be able to sue

7 under -- under a -- what is really analogous to a

8 contract.

9             I would also point out that this Court's

10 decision in Maine v. Thiboutot, which first recognized a

11 1983 cause of action, pointed to prior cases enforcing

12 Social Security programs, on the assumption that 1983

13 could have been the only source of the cause of action.

14 If there was an implied judge-made cause of action in

15 those circumstances, that assumption would have been

16 unwarranted.

17             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Kneedler, before you

18 sit down, could you please enlighten us on two fact

19 points?  One is, what is the status of the 30(A)

20 rulemaking?  Because I take it once the rule is made, it

21 would get Chevron deference.  You said that there would

22 be a final rule in December.  Is that still --

23             MR. KNEEDLER:  I am informed that it may

24 slip past December, that there -- there has been a lot

25 of interaction with -- with comments on it.  I don't



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

28

1 know a precise date, but I'm informed that that may be

2 possible.

3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How about the -- the

4 status of the -- the hearing on California's

5 compliance --

6             MR. KNEEDLER:  That is -- that is still

7 pending.  There have been extensions.  There have also

8 been planned amendments that have been submitted

9 covering some of these same rates.

10             Justice Ginsburg, I also wanted to respond

11 to one of your questions.  I do believe the United

12 States would have an injunctive action in certain

13 circumstances.  For example, if the United States

14 disapproved a plan and a State continued to -- a plan

15 amendment, and a State continued to follow the terms of

16 the disapproved plan amendment, I think the United

17 States would have a cause of action to enforce --

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under the --

19             MR. KNEEDLER:  -- as the party to the

20 contract.

21             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under a pre-emption --

22 would it be a pre-emption argument?

23             MR. KNEEDLER:  No, it would be enforcing the

24 -- the terms of its agreement with the -- with the

25 States.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

29

1             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you --

2             MR. KNEEDLER:  It doesn't have to rely on

3 pre-emption in those circumstances.

4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you agree with the

5 counsel for the Petitioner that if the State chose to

6 allow its courts to issue an injunction on Supremacy

7 Clause grounds in the State courts, that that would be

8 impermissible?

9             MR. KNEEDLER:  We think it's a harder

10 question, but probably so, because we believe paragraph

11 30(A) does not confer private rights, and that would be

12 true in the State court as well as Federal court.

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr.

14 Kneedler.

15             Mr. Phillips.

16            ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

17               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

18             MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice

19 and may it please the Court:

20             I'd like to focus on two points that came

21 out of the questioning in the first part of the oral

22 argument today.

23             First of all, I would like to focus on the

24 question -- the comment, at least, and the question that

25 flows from it, from Justice Alito, which is that there



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

30

1 has never been a recognition of a cause of action in any

2 Ex parte Young case.  And that's a hundred percent true,

3 and I didn't hear response to the other side that

4 suggests anything to the contrary.

5             And the reason for that is, obviously, what

6 this Court said in the Verizon case and what it said in

7 Shaw is that you look to the Supremacy Clause as the

8 basis for arising-under jurisdiction, and then if you

9 have jurisdiction, then you look to the traditional

10 equitable standards to determine whether they've been

11 satisfied in a particular case.

12             And under this Court's decision in Ex parte

13 Young, what the Court said was "an injunction which

14 restrains the state officer from taking any steps

15 towards the enforcement of an unconstitutional

16 enactment, to the injury of the complainant" is the

17 basis for relief.  And that's exactly the circumstance

18 that we have in this case, and thus --

19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why isn't -- why

20 doesn't your position constitute a complete end run

21 around all of our implied right of action jurisprudence?

22 We've wasted a lot of time trying to figure out whether

23 there's an implied right of action under a particular

24 statute if there has always been one under the Supremacy

25 Clause?



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

31

1             MR. PHILLIPS:  Mr. Chief Justice, there is a

2 very fundamental difference between an implied right of

3 action or an action under section 1983 and -- and a very

4 simple and straightforward Ex parte Young remedy that's

5 otherwise available.  Under 1983, at private rights of

6 action, the district courts, the Federal courts, State

7 courts for that matter in enforcing them, have authority

8 to grant damages, they have much broader injunctive

9 relief, and under section 1983, there's --

10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How can they have

11 much broader -- broader -- first of all, all of those

12 cases -- I don't know if all of them did, but certainly

13 a lot of them did include -- included claims for

14 injunctive relief.  And I would have thought the court's

15 authority under your equitable action under the

16 Constitution would be at least as broad as it would be

17 under the statute.

18             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, Ex parte Young has been

19 pretty consistently evaluated as saying simply you

20 cannot do what the Constitution immediately prohibits

21 you from doing.  And so -- and, frankly, the Ex parte

22 Young remedy has been a negative --

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But your position --

24             MR. PHILLIPS:  -- not to violate the --

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your position --



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

32

1             MR. PHILLIPS:  -- not to violate the

2 Supremacy Clause.

3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Your position is

4 that the Constitution prohibits you from doing anything

5 where the State law is pre-empted by the Federal law.

6 That doesn't sound very narrow to me.

7             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, but -- but if you go

8 back and look at the cases in which 1983 relief has been

9 involved, a case like Blessing -- in Blessing, the

10 complaint there sought essentially to take over the

11 entire State law function of providing support for

12 children.  And that was the injunctive relief that was

13 requested.  And if the Court had adopted the notion that

14 1983 carried with it a private right of action, that

15 would have been available relief; there would have been

16 a claim for damages in that circumstance; and there

17 would have been access to attorneys' fees.

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if the --

19             MR. PHILLIPS:  None of those things is

20 available here.

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What if the law that

22 Congress is -- Congress passes sets forth certain

23 Federal standards -- it's a cooperative Federal-State

24 law like this one -- and it says:  And there's no

25 private right of action for any individual to enforce



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

33

1 this.  That's limited to the Federal Government.

2             MR. PHILLIPS:  In that -- in that situation,

3 there's obviously no authority to bring a private right

4 of action under the statute.  That still doesn't answer

5 the question whether or not there is a right to invoke

6 the Supremacy Clause --

7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So, Congress can

8 say --

9             MR. PHILLIPS:  -- when there's a conflict

10 between Federal and State law.

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Congress can say in

12 the same statute that confers the allegedly pre-emptive

13 Federal standards that we do not want individuals

14 bringing actions in court to enforce this.  We want to

15 leave that up to HHS.  And you're saying, even though

16 Congress said that, individuals can nonetheless bring a

17 suit under the Supremacy Clause, the theory of which is

18 we are making sure that Federal law controls.

19             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The same Federal law

21 that says you can't bring a cause of action.

22             MR. PHILLIPS:  No, I understand that,

23 Mr. Chief Justice, but you still have the problem that

24 even under those circumstances, a regime can arise in

25 which there is a square and, in this case, you know, I



Official

34

1 think undeniable, conflict between Federal and State

2 law, and the question is -- and that that conflict

3 imposes not only injury in fact to an individual but

4 also imposes irreparable harm.

5             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you're saying then,

6 if Congress loud and clear says, we want HHS to be the

7 sole enforcer of this law, you're saying--

8             MR. PHILLIPS:  Of the Federal statute.

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Of this, yes.  You're

10 saying that that would be ineffective because there

11 could still be a Supremacy Clause claim.

12             MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  Whether or not you

13 would in fact get relief under the Supremacy Clause

14 seems to me a very --

15             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's on the merits --

16             MR. PHILLIPS:  -- tough question.

17             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- but Congress says, we

18 don't want anybody coming into the court.  We want --

19             MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't think Congress has

20 the authority to essentially say there are some

21 conflicts between Federal and State law that we will

22 simply ignore even though they cause irreparable injury.

23             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that necessary to your

24 position, Mr. Phillips?

25             MR. PHILLIPS:  Absolutely not, Justice

1 Kagan.

2             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because you could take the

3 view, right, that if Congress speaks to cut off a claim,

4 that's one thing, and a very different thing, than if

5 Congress has not spoken at all.

6             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  And it seems to me

7 here is a situation where you would expect Congress to

8 have spoken explicitly --

9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then it's a question of

10 what will be the default rule.  Congress is silent.

11             MR. PHILLIPS:  Of course.

12             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is the default rule that

13 there is a Supremacy Clause action or that Congress must

14 expressly allow it?

15             MR. PHILLIPS:  And the reason why the

16 default rule would almost certainly be that in fact you

17 can bring the Ex parte Young cause of action is because

18 the effect -- the Spending Clause has been subject to

19 the -- to pre-emption claims since 1968.  This whole

20 notion that they contracted against this background of

21 what obligations did they assume -- the obligation that

22 they clearly would have assumed is that if in fact there

23 is a violation of Federal law based on a failure to

24 satisfy one of the conditions of spending under these

25 circumstances, you would -- they would be susceptible to

3             MR. PHILLIPS:  -- injunctive action.

4             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm -- I'm not certain of

5 this.  I find this a difficult case.  It seems to me the

6 Government is prepared to concede that if an individual

7 has a Federal right that he'd like to enforce and

8 someone is trying to block it by asserting a State law

9 that he thinks is pre-empted, he can go ahead.  If it

10 looks as if the State is going to take something from

11 him that a Federal law guarantees and he has a defense

12 that he'd like to make to that under Federal law, the

13 State law that seems to allow it is pre-empted, he can

14 make it.

15             Our problem arises where neither of those

16 things is true.  So, we say, what is true here?  What

17 kind of Federal claim does he have?  And the word is

18 that rates have to be -- that the rate that the State

19 has to pay back to the doctor has to be "sufficient."

20 Okay, "sufficient."  That's basically the word.

21             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

22             JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So, I see three

23 possibilities.  One is you say, sure, let all the

24 doctors go and sue.  There are only 50,000 kinds of

25 reimbursement.  Maybe there are a million.  I don't know



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

37

1 how many.  And they only take place in, what, say,

2 400,000 counties.  And we will have Federal judges

3 reaching different views about what is sufficient in

4 each of those different places.  And sometimes they will

5 agree.  Did Congress want that?  Well, hmm, a problem.

6                 The second way of going about it is cure

7 that and say:  You win, but you have to use primary

8 jurisdiction, and you have to get the government's view

9 on it, Judge; and before you decide, you have to pay

10 attention.

11             MR. PHILLIPS:  Can I --

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  There's a long line of

13 cases.  I have one more thing --

14             MR. PHILLIPS:  Can I --

15             JUSTICE BREYER:  -- then you'll get all

16 three.

17             MR. PHILLIPS:  But can I deal with that one

18 immediately?

19             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

20             MR. PHILLIPS:  Because I think it's

21 important in the context of this case to recognize.

22 We're talking about the issuance of a preliminary

23 injunction that was designed to hold everything until

24 matters could be avoided.  We realize that we're talking

25 about a situation where the State, solely for budgetary



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

38

1 reasons, without regard to Federal law whatsoever,

2 simply made a slash in the reimbursements.

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  If I want your view, I want

4 your view on whether the right approach -- you're saying

5 what's the status quo pending.  And I want your view on

6 these three possibilities.

7             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  I --

8             JUSTICE BREYER:  One is the possibility the

9 judges just do it in all the different places, try to

10 figure out what's sufficient.  The second is the

11 possibility that we try primary jurisdiction, and that's

12 the -- then the curlicue on that is what do you do

13 pending?  And, you know, that's your injunction.

14             MR. PHILLIPS:  And that's what I just want

15 to be clear on.

16             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, yes.  And the third

17 possibility is you say:  I'm just sorry that the -- this

18 is just too vague, the "sufficient" et cetera.  It has

19 to be centralized.  There's no way to work this out with

20 all these different judges and different kinds of rates

21 and different kinds of provisions.  And so, this is an

22 instance where you cannot bring your claim that

23 something violates the Supremacy Clause because you

24 don't have a Federal right to a thing, and they're not

25 trying to take away a thing that the Federal right gives



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

39

1 you, et cetera.

2             All right.  Do you see those three

3 possibilities?

4             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

5             JUSTICE BREYER:  And what I wanted you to do

6 is to address them.

7             MR. PHILLIPS:  The -- the third possibility,

8 it seems to me, Justice Breyer, is not much different

9 from a lot of the other cases that this Court has

10 already decided --

11             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

12             MR. PHILLIPS:  -- like Crosby and like

13 Engine Manufacturers, where there's the vague standard

14 out there, and the -- and it doesn't -- and they're not

15 asserting a right to be -- not to have an enforcement

16 action brought against them.  And this Court has

17 routinely held in that circumstance that there is in

18 fact a Supremacy Clause action available.  So, I don't

19 think the third option is really an option.  And it also

20 ultimately goes to the merits of the pre-emption claim.

21             If it turns out that all of this is just too

22 squishy to evaluate, then it would seem to me that on

23 the merits, then you would say there's not a clear

24 enough statement of Federal law to justify saying

25 there's a conflict that would -- and, therefore, you



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

40

1 would lose on the merits.  But that wouldn't prevent you

2 from going into court and trying to make the kind of

3 showing that we made here.

4             JUSTICE BREYER:  You think primary

5 jurisdiction is the way to do it.

6             MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes.

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  You see, I see a practical

8 problem, and I'm -- the practical problem is millions of

9 rates all judged by the term "sufficient," and instead

10 of the agency in charge deciding what's sufficient, we

11 do have a lot of judges.

12             MR. PHILLIPS:  But, Justice Breyer, the

13 agency always has the ultimate authority here to step in

14 and take action.  And I think the real question is, is

15 it reasonable to think that Congress meant to place this

16 in an agency, in circumstances where the agency isn't

17 going to receive notice of the implementation of the

18 change before it gets implemented, where the State is

19 permitted to take no -- to make no response to a request

20 for information and allow the unlawful rates to go into

21 effect for years on end?

22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, could I ask --

23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Fighting -- why are you

24 fighting Justice Breyer so much?

25             MR. PHILLIPS:  I didn't think I was.



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

41

1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, it sounds like

2 you are, and that's why I am having some difficulty.

3             There are two points, following up on his

4 and then my second question.  Engage the Solicitor

5 General's suggestion that this isn't a cause of action

6 under the Supremacy Clause, but that it is a cause of

7 action under some implied equitable --

8             MR. PHILLIPS:  Doctrine.

9             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  -- doctrine, okay?

10 Which may square.  And I'm now coming back to Justice

11 Breyer's question.  I agree with all you were trying to

12 say about what the State did or didn't do here, but if

13 it's a primary jurisdiction question, what's wrong with

14 just saying that the court's power is limited under

15 equity to issuing an injunction that gives the matter

16 over to the administrative agency that puts in the

17 status quo -- assuming there's some sort of violation of

18 Federal law or seeming violation of Federal law -- a

19 preventive injunction that just stops the State from

20 acting until the administrative process concludes?

21             MR. PHILLIPS:  Justice Sotomayor --

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What's wrong with that?

23             MR. PHILLIPS:  There's nothing wrong with

24 that.  Candidly, we -- we would be perfectly comfortable

25 with that, but I don't understand the other side to be



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

42

1 complaining about the scope of the injunctive relief.

2 It is not that they are saying --

3             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, no.  They're saying

4 you can't have any.

5             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  And so --

6             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But -- but Justice

7 Breyer's question, I think, was slightly different,

8 which is, what's the limit on --

9             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the court's power?

11 And how do you --

12             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, we did have an

13 alternative argument that the injunction should --

14 should stay into effect at least until HHS acts, and the

15 -- the district court granted a broader preliminary

16 injunction and didn't consider the alternative argument

17 that was -- that was there.

18             But, again, it seems to me that, you know,

19 the court ought to recognize that you're in the context

20 of preliminary injunctive relief in this situation, and

21 -- and there will be plenty of time to kind of work

22 through the nature of the injunctive relief if in fact

23 the court's allowed to go forward and take up the Ex

24 parte Young issue under the circumstance.

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Would you engage the



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

43

1 question that -- the approach the Solicitor General has

2 been making, which is don't find a cause of action under

3 the Supremacy Clause; find it in the court's -- an

4 implied cause of action?

5             MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm not perfectly comfortable

6 with that rationale.  I think the answer is it's sort of

7 a combination of the Supremacy Clause and the -- and

8 broad equitable relief, rather than -- I mean, clearly

9 one or the other.  They seem to go pretty much

10 hand-in-glove in the ex parte line of cases.  And so, I

11 don't have any particular problem with that.

12             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I might, if you

13 continue in your earlier position that a Supremacy

14 Clause cause of action would stop Congress from having a

15 -- a voice in enforcement in cutting it off clearly, if

16 Congress were to write a law that says no one can

17 enforce this, either in damages or in injunctive relief.

18 Your earlier answer seemed to suggest Congress didn't

19 have the power under the Supremacy Clause to do that.

20             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I -- suppose there

21 were --

22             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If this were in

23 equity --

24             MR. PHILLIPS:  It will depend on the -- on

25 the circumstances of the case, but I do think there is



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

44

1 some gap between the full extent of Congress's power in

2 this area and -- and the protections of the Supremacy

3 Clause, if for no other reason -- and because the

4 executive branch also has the authority and, certainly

5 acting within its own exclusive authority, could --

6 could pre-empt State law or could create a situation

7 where State law would be pre-empted.  And I don't think

8 Congress would have the authority to -- to take away the

9 Ex parte Young remedy under -- under those particular

10 circumstances.

11             JUSTICE ALITO:  What is your response to the

12 argument that the equitable power exercised in Ex parte

13 Young and similar cases is limited to certain specific

14 situations such as where there is an imminent threat of

15 the State enforcement action, and a few others where

16 there's a trespass, where there's a clearly defined

17 Federal right?  I mean, it doesn't encompass every

18 situation in which the plaintiff simply has Article III

19 standing and wants to obtain an injunction that a

20 particular State law is pre-empted by Federal law.

21             MR. PHILLIPS:  The -- I mean, to be sure,

22 the Court in Ex parte Young was dealing with a specific

23 situation of trying to prevent enforcement.  But the --

24 the Supreme Court -- this Court in all of its decisions

25 post-Ex parte Young has never said that that's the only



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

45

1 circumstance and has certainly never said that in

2 exercising the judicial power under Article III that

3 extends to all cases in equity, that it means only the

4 equity that existed in -- in the 18th century at that

5 point in time.

6             So, it seems to me the right answer at this

7 stage is for this Court to look at the situation and

8 say:  Is this a context in which equitable relief would

9 be appropriate?  And if you just use the preliminary

10 injunction standards, it clearly would be appropriate

11 under -- under these particular circumstances, where we

12 have a likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable

13 harm, and the balance of harms favor the -- favor the

14 plaintiff.

15             JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.

16             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So, what is the best

17 authority in our cases, other than Ex parte Young, or in

18 a treatise or in recognized statements of the difference

19 in law and equity for the proposition that in this area

20 we can make a distinction between law and equity after

21 centuries in which we've tried to say that that

22 distinction ought to be blurred?

23             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well --

24             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, do you want us --

25 would you want us to write an opinion and say, oh,



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

46

1 there's a difference in damages at equity?

2             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, all -- all we --

3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What do I -- other than Ex

4 parte Young, what do I cite for that?

5             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, any of the cases in

6 which the Court has recognized that obviously in order

7 to get -- in order to get injunctive relief, you have to

8 demonstrate that there's -- that there's no adequate

9 remedy at law.  So, I mean, the distinction has always

10 been there, even after the merging of law and equity --

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That -- that's not --

12             MR. PHILLIPS:  -- in the early part of the

13 last century.

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's not the theory on

15 which we've said you can't get damages under Ex parte

16 Young.  The theory that prevents damages is the theory

17 of sovereign immunity.  The -- the fiction that

18 you're -- that you're moving against the individual and

19 not against the State simply cannot be maintained when

20 you're taking money out of the State treasury.  That's

21 the basis for it, not -- not what you just described.

22             MR. PHILLIPS:  No, but I'm -- but I'm not

23 asking for -- for -- I mean, we're not asking for

24 damages here, Justice Scalia.

25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I know, but see --



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

47

1             MR. PHILLIPS:  All we're asking for

2 is injunctive relief.

3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that -- but that

4 wouldn't explain the case like Gonzaga where there was

5 no State entity.  Gonzaga was a private institution.

6             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  But --

7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So, I'm -- I'm wondering.

8 I understand the Eleventh Amendment dynamic, which --

9             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  -- as Justice Scalia

11 points out, was the whole driving force of -- of Ex

12 parte Young.  Is there -- is there any other basis for

13 us to say that there has to be a law/equity distinction?

14 You say, well, that's because there is no adequate

15 remedy at law.  But that's circular; that assumes

16 because there's no cause of action -- so, that doesn't

17 work.

18             MR. PHILLIPS:  No, but I -- I mean, all of

19 the cases that come out of the Ex parte Young line of

20 authority seem to base -- you know, they all tee off,

21 obviously, the problem that exists in this context,

22 which is -- which is the one that Justice Scalia

23 identified.

24             JUSTICE BREYER:  There must be a limit.

25 There must be a limit because if there is not a limit on

1 what you can do under Ex parte Young, I can go in my

2 office and I look at the statute books and they are just

3 filled with statutes, and I -- Federal; and if I had all

4 the State statute books, it would be 15 offices or 20 or

5 100.  And I know perfectly well that a lot of those

6 statutes in the Federal books have to do with agencies,

7 and they give jobs to agencies, and it's perfectly

8 apparent that the ones who run those statutes in many

9 instances are the agencies, and really judges are out of

10 it.

11             Now, if I adopt your line, it seems to me I

12 am saying that any time that a person has an individual

13 of saying that a State law is contrary to one of those

14 statutes, he can run right into court.  And I can see

15 we've done that where he has some kind of right that

16 he's protecting that's threatened in some way or that he

17 wants to assert.  I can see that we could do that in the

18 foreign policy case like Burma; I can see that we could

19 do that where Federal voting rights are at stake, which

20 are very important.

21             But a principle that says you can do that

22 any time you want seems to me a little -- it's -- it

23 seems to me the real fear of far-reaching in this extent

24 that it just stops the agency from doing their business

25 at the behest of anyone who would like to assert a State

1 law, or States -- it's a mess, in other words.

2             MR. PHILLIPS:  Justice Breyer, can I -- two

3 points here:  First of all, we are not talking about a

4 situation of somebody seeking a roving commission to go

5 find out all Federal -- all situations where State law

6 violates Federal law.  We're -- the beneficiaries in

7 this case --

8             JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  Your people have

9 your problem.

10             MR. PHILLIPS:  But those are life-and-death

11 problems.

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  But some other people have

13 another problem.

14             MR. PHILLIPS:  But my people have a

15 life-and-death problem, Justice Breyer.  So, if there

16 were ever a situation where you would say let's look to

17 see whether or not there is relief available, this would

18 be the situation where -- where I would hope --

19             JUSTICE BREYER:  The doctors want to be paid

20 more money or at least not paid as much as they were; I

21 understand that.

22             MR. PHILLIPS:  But the beneficiaries --

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

24             MR. PHILLIPS:  The patients are the one who

25 lose access to --

50

1             JUSTICE BREYER:  So, is there a medical

2 exception?

3             MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm sorry.

4             JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there a medical

5 exception?  Is it that you can have this generalized

6 claim if you're a doctor, but not others?

7             MR. PHILLIPS:  No, to be sure, Justice

8 Breyer.  The exception is that we have to satisfy the

9 requirements of Article III.  We have to have injury and

10 redressability, and in order to get equitable relief, we

11 ultimately are going to have to demonstrate that the

12 injury is irreparable, that there is no adequate remedy

13 at law.  Those are high burdens --

14             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Phillips --

15             MR. PHILLIPS:  -- and in a circumstance

16 where you cannot get damages and you cannot get

17 attorneys' fees.

18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Phillips, could I ask

19 you a little bit more about how this interacts with the

20 agency process?  Now, suppose that California had done

21 what, the way I read the statute, it was supposed to do,

22 which is to go to the agency and say:  We want to change

23 our rates.  We can't afford these rates anymore, and we

24 think these lower rates would do just as well.  All

25 right?



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

51

1             And then the agency and California sit down

2 and discuss the matter.  Would this suit have ever come

3 into being?

4             MR. PHILLIPS:  If they had just discussed

5 the matter?

6             JUSTICE KAGAN:  You know, they did not

7 impose them unilaterally.  They go to the -- to HHS and

8 they wait for HHS to approve what they want to do.  If

9 HHS approves --

10             MR. PHILLIPS:  We wouldn't be here.  I can

11 guarantee you we wouldn't be here.

12             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, if -- if HHS approved,

13 maybe somebody does sue.  And then there's great

14 deference to the agency --

15             MR. PHILLIPS:  That's --

16             JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- isn't that right?

17             MR. PHILLIPS:  That's exactly right.

18             JUSTICE KAGAN:  And if HHS doesn't approve,

19 then what's there to talk about?  There's no suit.

20             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  No, there's no

21 question that --

23 wins, right?

25 wins.  That's the rule that they --

6             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean -- I mean, if

13 saying if the agency didn't approve, your clients don't

14 have anything to complain about.

15             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, because -- well --

17 answer or a different one?

19 depends on whether they go ahead.  If California, in the

21 would -- I assume you meant that California complied.

22             JUSTICE KAGAN:  Correct.

23             JUSTICE ALITO:  No, but the agency approves

24 rates and someone who's dissatisfied with the rates sues

25 and says these rates are ridiculously low.

3             JUSTICE ALITO:  They still can sue --

4             MR. PHILLIPS:  -- Justice Alito.  The -- the

5 bottom line is you're going to lose that -- that

6 litigation and in a circumstance where you have no

7 realistic prospect of --

8             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how do you know

9 they're going to lose the litigation?  Why should they

10 lose the litigation if it's really -- if there really is

11 a cause of action there?  Some of the Medicaid rates are

12 very low, aren't they?

13             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, ultimately, you have to

14 demonstrate that there's -- that there is a -- by clear

15 and convincing evidence, a conflict between Federal and

16 State law.  And the agency that has -- that evaluates

17 the standards of Federal law will have said in a very

18 authoritative way that there is not a violation under

19 those circumstances.

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you still have a

21 cause of action under the Supremacy Clause.

22             MR. PHILLIPS:  Oh, no, to be sure, I have a

23 cause of action.

24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought you were

25 saying you didn't --

1             MR. PHILLIPS:  No, no.

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- if the agency --

3             MR. PHILLIPS:  No, no.  I'm not saying you

4 don't, I'm just -- all I'm saying is that if the -- if

5 the process works appropriately, there would be not the

6 litigation that Justice Breyer was worried about, where

7 you would have hundreds of thousands of cases going

8 forward.

9             If the process -- which, again, it goes back

10 to the default rule.

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  You've lost me here.  You

12 -- you say there would be a cause of action under the

13 Supremacy Clause if the agency approves the rates, but

14 your clients don't think the rates are high enough?

15             MR. PHILLIPS:  Sure, we would still say

16 there's a --

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Under the --

18             MR. PHILLIPS:  We would still have an

19 argument that there's a conflict between Federal and

20 State law.

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, Federal law is

22 determined by the agency, surely.  So long as the agency

23 is complying with the Administrative Procedure Act, I

24 don't see how you have any --

25             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well --



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

55

1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  -- any cause of action

2 under the Supremacy Clause; you may have an APA cause of

3 action.

4             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, we -- well, the problem

5 with the APA -- we might have an APA cause of action,

6 but I also think that there is a -- I mean, I -- look,

7 that hypothetical is so far afield --

8             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Federal law is not

9 determined by the agency?

10             MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Federal law is not

12 determined by the agency?

13             MR. PHILLIPS:  No, of course, Federal law is

14 determined by the agency, but not without limits.

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, then you don't have a

16 Supremacy Clause cause of action.

17             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think you -- I still

18 think you can bring an action under the Supremacy

19 Clause.  I think, ultimately, you have very -- you have

20 zero hope of prevailing --

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why does the --

22             MR. PHILLIPS:  -- which was my point.

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why does the agency

24 get to determine Federal law when Congress doesn't?  You

25 told me earlier if Congress --



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

56

1             MR. PHILLIPS:  Because Congress --

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  -- Congress says in

3 a statute no implied right of action, that that doesn't

4 control.

5             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, but that doesn't --

6 that controls to the extent of trying to enforce

7 directly the Federal statute; it doesn't control with

8 respect to trying to enforce the Supremacy Clause.

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  The Supremacy Clause says

10 that judges in every State shall be bound thereby, but

11 if you want to amend it so that judges in every State

12 and all administrators should be bound thereby, then you

13 have a Supremacy Clause action against every Federal

14 agency.  That doesn't make sense.

15             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, no, but what the

16 Supremacy Clause says is that Federal law will be

17 supreme in all circumstances, notwithstanding State

18 law --

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Number one, it doesn't say

20 that.  There's no -- it doesn't say "all circumstances."

21 It doesn't say that.

22             MR. PHILLIPS:  The Supremacy Clause -- well,

23 I don't know of any exceptions in the Supremacy Clause

24 where State law gets to remain supreme to Federal law.

25             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm -- well, no.  Justice

1 Scalia's question was related to a Federal agency.  The

2 Federal agency does something that's inconsistent with

3 the statute, arguably, and you say there's a Supremacy

4 Clause violation?  That's novel.

5             MR. PHILLIPS:  No, not -- not that -- not

6 what the agency has done violates the Supremacy Clause;

7 it's the State acting pursuant to what the agency has

8 approved, that if you still thought it violated Federal

9 law, would be a basis for seeking a Supremacy Clause

10 action.  But, no, Justice Scalia is right.  The obvious

11 -- the obvious solution to the immediate problem is to

12 seek review of the decision by HHS and to -- and to

13 follow it under those circumstances.

14             The -- the second point that I wanted to

15 focus a little bit about, because it does seem to me --

16 again, it goes to what are -- what should be the

17 background principles that operate here.  And a couple

18 of Justices specifically raised the question of, you

19 know, would this case be different if we were seeking to

20 balance-bill -- that is, to bill the extent to which we

21 were allowed to bill prior to the time that the State of

22 California reduced by 10 percent, if we brought that

23 lawsuit, would that be perfectly permissible?

24             And I understand California, I think, has

25 suggested that it would be, and I heard Mr. Kneedler



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

58

1 suggest that, well, there might be some additional

2 issues there.  But the reality is, is it seems to me

3 that shows you just how unrealistic the -- the

4 distinction is in this particular case, because we're

5 talking about individuals -- you know, the question is

6 not, you know, how are you going to implement this down

7 the road?  The question is, what do you do with someone

8 who is suffering a lack of access to vital medical care

9 in a way that is irreparable?  And is it realistic to

10 think that Congress meant under those circumstances to

11 deprive the individual plaintiff of any kind of rights?

12             And the answer is no.  And that's -- that's

13 as far as the Court needs to go.  It doesn't need to

14 figure out exactly how far Congress could deal with the

15 Supremacy Clause.  I realize that there is some

16 skepticism on that score.  But on the core question

17 here, did Congress intend to deprive these plaintiffs of

18 their rights under Ex parte Young, the answer is no --

19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The answer is yes,

20 they intended to deprive them of the right to sue under

21 the statute.  I understand that you're not challenging

22 the proposition that this statute, when Congress was

23 specifically focused on the question of how to enforce

24 this provision, they did not provide a right of action.

25 And under our implied right of action jurisprudence,



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

59

1 that means there isn't one.

2             So, why when they're confronted with the

3 precise question did they say no, we don't want these

4 people to sue, but you say, well, they knew under the

5 Constitution they were going to be able to anyway?

6             MR. PHILLIPS:  Because -- because there is a

7 difference between providing a private right of action

8 and all the bells and whistles that go with that, as

9 opposed to recognizing that Ex parte Young is the

10 background principle that has been in place for well

11 over a century and that says that when the -- when the

12 standards for equitable relief are satisfied, the courts

13 have the power, and they can prevent the violation of

14 the Supremacy Clause.

15             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said you would be

16 satisfied with a limitation that the Court can issue an

17 injunction pending the administrative procedure without

18 going on to then the substance of the question, was

19 there compliance with 30(A) by California?

20             MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I

21 would have been perfectly comfortable with that.  I

22 mean, that was one of the alternative grounds for relief

23 that we sought.  The district judge didn't happen to go

24 down that particular path.

25             But, clearly, from our perspective, the



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

60

1 important element is to maintain the status quo ante

2 until a resolution of the legality of California's

3 statute can be made, either by the agency or by the

4 courts.  But the -- but the one thing you shouldn't be

5 allowed to do is simply to -- to permit this to drift

6 without any remedy and without any ability to get access

7 to medical care that's clearly inconsistent with what

8 Congress intended and where a remedy is available under

9 the Ex parte Young formulation.

10             If there are no further questions, Your

11 Honors, thank you.

12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mr.

13 Phillips.

14             Ms. Schwartz, you have 4 minutes remaining.

15          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KARIN S. SCHWARTZ

16                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

17             MS. SCHWARTZ:  Thank you, Your Honor.

18             So, there are other provisions of the

19 Medicaid Act that are privately enforceable.  This one

20 is not.  I'd like to address the Court's questions about

21 Ex parte Young.  Ex parte Young, of course, involved a

22 -- the Due Process Clause, not the Supremacy Clause, as

23 the substantive provision of the Constitution that was

24 being enforced, and the plaintiff had an independent,

25 free-standing property or personal right in Ex parte



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

61

1 Young, in all of the cases that are its progeny.

2             Now, there's another -- I want to address

3 Justice Alito's point about, do we apply the rights

4 language -- the rights requirement in Ex parte Young

5 causes of action?  Yes, you do.  Alexander v. Sandoval,

6 California v. Sierra Club, Blessing v. Freestone.

7             Look at Alexander v. Sandoval.  The State

8 passes a constitutional amendment that says English

9 only.  The -- the State adopts a policy, English-only

10 drivers tests.  This is challenged as conflicting with

11 Federal law and specifically a Federal regulation.  The

12 Court said no -- no, Cort v. Ash was satisfied.

13 Congress drafts statutes; it controls who gets to

14 enforce them.

15             JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry --

16             MS. SCHWARTZ:  No cause of action.

17             JUSTICE KAGAN:  -- Ms. Schwartz.  Are you

18 saying -- this is the way I understood you, and tell me

19 if I'm right:  Are you saying that the test for

20 determining whether there's a 1983 suit is the same as

21 the test for determining whether there is an Ex parte

22 Young action?  Because you talked about, you know,

23 whether somebody has a right, which is usually the

24 language we use in the 1983 context.

25             MS. SCHWARTZ:  No, I'm not.  The test for



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

62

1 whether there is an Ex parte -- and there's different

2 meanings of Ex parte Young, but none of them apply here.

3 You can see Ex parte Young as construing a cause of

4 action under the Due Process Clause.  This not a cause

5 of action under the Due Process Clause.

6             You could see Ex parte Young as involving a

7 specific kind of bill in equity which is a defense of

8 regulation of your conduct where that regulation

9 infringes a personal or property right.  That is not

10 this case.  There's no regulation of Respondents'

11 conduct, and there's no infringement of a personal or

12 property right in this case.  The only entity that's

13 being regulated by the State -- by the State statute

14 that purportedly is being -- well, that is being

15 challenged as pre-empted is the State of California

16 itself because we are the entity that sets rates, and so

17 the -- the statute tells the agency this is how you will

18 set rates.

19             So, however you look at ex parte Young,

20 plaintiffs cannot satisfy the elements of an Ex parte

21 Young cause of action.

22             What I'm saying with respect to

23 Alexander v. Sandoval and these other cases is injury is

24 not enough.  You have to have a -- a right.  Under

25 equity, injury has never been enough, and it's not



Official

Alderson Reporting Company

63

1 enough under this Court's separation of powers decisions

2 and its Spending Clause cases.

3             And I wanted to just segue very quickly to

4 this idea that there's a default rule that a Supremacy

5 Clause cause of action exists by default.  That is

6 absolutely not true, and it is not true in this context,

7 and I'd like to identify two reasons.

8             First, the Suter fix.  The -- Congress

9 acted, when this Court in Suter said that there was no

10 cause of action.  And it said just because something is

11 in a -- in a State plan doesn't render it unenforceable.

12 But we want to preserve the holding in Suter.

13             Well, it -- that suggests that other things

14 are unenforceable, that Congress is not legislating

15 against a backdrop of an assumption that there's an

16 injunctive relief claim, or it wouldn't have required

17 the Suter fix.  In Maine v. Thiboutot, another case that

18 assumes -- that recognizes that with respect to Spending

19 Clause actions, the sole means -- the Spending Clause

20 statutes, the means, the vehicle for enforcing is 1983.

21

22             And, finally, in the Spending Clause

23 context, we have the clear statement rule, which is

24 incompatible with just an assumption that a cause of

25 action always exists.  Because the State has to have

1 knowing and acceptance -- knowing and then accepting --

2 accept its obligations, we require that there be a clear

3 statement.

4             Thank you, Your Honor.

5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

6 Counsel.  The case is submitted.

7             (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the

8 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
