 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 07-308, United States versus Clintwood 

Elkhorn Mining Company.

 Mr. Jay.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. JAY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Respondent sought and received a full refund 

of the tax they paid on exported coal for the full 

three-year period permitted them by the tax-refund 

statute. What the court of appeals' decision permitted 

them to do was to bring an additional action for 

indistinguishable relief, but for a three-year period 

beyond what the tax-refund statute permits.

 We submit that that decision was erroneous 

for two principal reasons: First, the plaintiff --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It might help if you 

raise that lectern a bit.

 MR. JAY: Hang on.

 Is that better, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, thank you.

 MR. JAY: Thank you.

The plain and unabiguous terms of the 

tax-refund statute, section 7422(a), expressly provide 

that any claimant who alleges that a tax has been 

illegally assessed, no matter the reason, must before 

proceeding to court file a refund claim with the 

Internal Revenue Service within three years after filing 

the tax return on which the illegal tax was paid.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Jay, is the government 

running with the fox and chasing with the hounds? You 

want us to apply the provisions governing the Internal 

Revenue Code with regard to whether the statute has 

expired, but when it comes to interest you say oh, no, 

no, no, that doesn't apply. Why? Why shouldn't the two 

go pari passu, as we say?

 MR. JAY: Well, we think, Your Honor, that 

the interest provision is in fact a key part of the 

tax-refund statute and so Respondent's attempt to invoke 

the tax-refund judgment interest provision is 

inconsistent with their theory, that they're proceeding 

outside the scope of the tax ---

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, yes, they make the same 

mistake, but that doesn't justify your making the same, 

the same mistake.

 MR. JAY: Well, we think, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's either, you

know, they're both in one pot or they're both in the 

other pot. And both sides want to -- want to split them 

up, but why don't they go together?

 MR. JAY: Well, we think the whole case is 

in the Title 26 pot, Your Honor, that the whole case 

should proceed under the provisions of Title 26, meaning 

that Respondents have already received the full tax 

refund to which they are entitled. And to be sure, they 

received interest on that refund. And had they to sue 

for it, they would have received interest under section 

2411. But because they are -- because they are no 

longer able to proceed under the exclusive tax-refund 

procedure, of course we think that they -- that they 

can't plead around that by claiming constitutional 

damages instead.

 But if the Court were to agree with them and 

agree that they could pursue damages for a violation of 

the Export Clause, section 2411 does not apply to such a 

claim because it's not a claim for an overpayment of 

tax. The term "overpayment" in the interest statute 

ties back to the section 6402, which is the linchpin of 

the tax-refund statute. And the -- when a taxpayer has 

made an overpayment, that triggers the obligation of the 

IRS to provide a tax refund if one is timely sought, and 

if one isn't timely sought, as this Court recognized in

the Brockamp case, the Congress has provided an 

unusually emphatic limitation on the Commissioner's 

ability to refund.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can you explain one thing 

to me? I take it that they -- everybody says they went 

through all the right IRS hoops to get back three years' 

worth of damages, i.e., they get their payments back and 

they get interest.

 MR. JAY: That's right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what they want is they 

want three years before that.

 MR. JAY: That's right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And they're too late under 

Title 26. So what you're saying is, one, you can't get 

any interest and, two, you can't get your money back at 

all.

 MR. JAY: Well, on the interest, Your Honor, 

we're saying that they were entitled to the interest on 

the three years.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm saying for three years 

they're home-free. They get their payment back and they 

get their interest. Now let's go to the three preceding 

years. I'm a little confused about that because I can't 

work out -- I suppose that the government is saying: 

You get nothing, you don't get your money back, and you

don't get your interest. Or is the government saying: 

You get your money back; you just don't get the 

interest? Which is it? And I don't see how it could be 

the latter.

 MR. JAY: It is the former, Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

 MR. JAY: -- because we're saying that 

because Respondents waited for 21 years while paying the 

tax without -- without filing a refund claim, that 

they're limited to the three years immediately preceding 

the refund claim --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. I thought you were 

making a second argument, that even if they were 

entitled to it despite the statute, they wouldn't be 

entitled to interest. You don't make that claim?

 MR. JAY: No. If they were entitled to sue, 

not under the tax -- under the tax code at all, but on 

the theory countenanced by the court of appeals, that 

this is not a suit for a tax refund at all, but a suit 

for damages arising directly under the Constitution --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I see.

 MR. JAY: -- then there is no provision in 

Title 28 or anywhere else that provides the required 

express provision --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

MR. JAY: -- of interest that's necessary to 

award interest against the government.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Right. Okay.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why shouldn't it be a 

suit contesting the constitutionality? I mean, in the 

usual case where you seek a refund, there are 

adjustments that have to be made. But here, if the only 

question is the constitutionality of the tax, then what 

is the point of going through any kind of administrative 

process of the refund route?

 MR. JAY: In the context of the coal tax, 

Your Honor, and the Export Clause claim, the purpose of 

requiring exhaustion, requiring Respondents to proceed 

before the IRS, is that the coal tax is exempt from 

taxation under the Constitution only if the coal at the 

moment the tax is imposed, which in this case is when 

it's first sold by the manufacturer, the mining company, 

if at that moment, the coal was in the stream of export. 

And in the context of the coal industry that can be a 

fairly fact-specific question, and the IRS technical 

advice memorandum that we've cited on page 11 of our 

reply brief explains that to some degree. So it's 

possible for a timely refund claim to allow the IRS to 

examine the facts and circumstances of the transaction 

and determine whether in fact the coal was in the stream

of export at all.

 Further, the IRS -- if it has only an excise 

tax return from the taxpayer, IRS has no idea what 

percentage of that coal was exported. Well over 90 

percent of the coal mined in the United States remains 

in the United States and there's nothing on Form 720, 

the excite tax return, that specifies how much of that 

coal is exported. So effectively by filing the two-page 

refund claim the taxpayer puts the IRS on notice of what 

percentage of coal in the given years was in fact in the 

stream of export when it was sold, whether in fact the 

broker or whoever purchased it actually purchased it, 

actually exported it from the country, and also how --

what the dollar amount of tax refund is being sought.

 So all of those, we think, are perfectly 

valid purposes for requiring a short but reasonable time 

to proceed before the IRS. And if the IRS denies the 

claim, then of course Respondents could have proceeded 

directly to court.

 The IRS did not in fact deny their claim, 

and the IRS has issued a notice of acquiescence 

specifying that the coal tax -- coal taxpayers who paid 

this coal tax and filed timely refund claims will 

receive a refund to the full extent that Congress has 

permitted the IRS to grant refunds.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Plus interest.

 MR. JAY: Plus interest, that's right, Your 

Honor. Under section 6611, interest is fully available 

on refunds. And again, if the -- if the IRS had denied 

the claims and Respondents had been forced to go to 

court, they would have received interest accounting for 

that time delay as well.

 So we think that Section 7422 is the 

exclusive means of bringing a claim that a tax was 

illegally or erroneously assessed or collected. The 

terms of the statute are clear; they're unambiguous; and 

they're exclusive. 7422(a) simply is the only way of 

bringing this claim.

 And we think that whether Respondents 

denominate their claim as a statutory-refund claim or a 

constitutional claim, the terms of section 7244(a) 

plainly cover it. So we think that the Court need not 

necessarily answer the question of whether the Export 

Clause creates a self-enforcing cause of action at all.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could the IRS say 

that the statute -- or Congress, I guess, say the 

statute of limitations is one month?

 MR. JAY: To file a timely refund claim, 

Your Honor?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, and anything

after that, any constitutional violation after that, is 

just not remediable?

 MR. JAY: Well, the constitutional violation 

would have taken place before in Your Honor's 

hypothetical.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Five weeks before.

 MR. JAY: In the McKesson case, Your Honor, 

the Court outlined a number of the options that taxing 

authorities have to respect their strong fiscal interest 

in the stability of their tax revenues while providing 

appropriate relief. And the Court listed as one way in 

which States can -- States and other taxing authorities 

can protect that by providing a short statute of 

limitations. The Court also suggested that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We're talking about 

-- we're talking about the Constitution here. And in 

effect -- I mean, I assume I could run through the usual 

routine. I mean, you wouldn't say they could have a 

statute of limitations of two days, right?

 MR. JAY: Well, Your Honor, in McKesson the 

Court pointed to another alternative, which is requiring 

that the tax be paid under protest. And that 

effectively is a statute of limitations of zero days, in 

that when -- you know, that when the tax is paid, the 

taxpayer has to identify the basis of the constitutional

challenge and the amount being paid under protest.

 And under -- and before the Tucker Act, and 

indeed in the early years of the Tucker Act, taxes had 

to be paid under protest or the taxpayer was out, was 

out the remedy against the collector. And Congress has 

since provided that in general taxpayers don't have to 

pay their taxes under protest. Instead, they can bring 

a refund claim within three years afterwards.  But that 

three-year limitation period, while relatively generous, 

is absolute.

 And the Court held in the Brockamp case that 

the three years can't be extended, not even for an 

individual taxpayer suffering from senile dementia for 

the entire time period.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think there are any 

circumstances in which a taxpayer can bring a claim 

under the Tucker Act for the refund of an 

unconstitutional tax?

 MR. JAY: Well, we think -- I want to 

clarify, Your Honor, that any lawsuit, whether it's on 

Respondent's theory or on our theory, any lawsuit that's 

filed is in fact under the Tucker Act.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, any situation in which 

such a suit can be brought without having filed a claim 

previously with the IRS?

MR. JAY: If the only -- if the only basis 

for the taxpayers' recovery is that the taxpayer has 

paid a tax and the tax was illegally or erroneously 

assessed because it was unconstitutional, we think that 

section 7422(a) and the associated time limits provide 

the procedure for recovering under the Tucker Act.

 Section 2501, which is what Respondents 

contend is the only procedure that applies to the claims 

that they have brought, section 2501, as the Court 

recognized --

JUSTICE ALITO: Just to be clear, so your 

argument is not limited to the Export Clause. It 

doesn't matter what provision of the Constitution the 

tax violates. The same rule would apply?

 MR. JAY: Well, the Congress has made no 

distinction in the statute between one type of 

constitutional claim and another, or indeed one type of 

illegality or another. And we've cited some -- some 

examples in our opening brief of numerous constitutional 

provisions that taxpayers may bring challenges under. 

And there are at least five clauses in the original 

Constitution that regulate the Federal Government's 

taxing authority. There are at least four more that 

regulate the States, and, you know, not to mention the 

Bill of Rights.

So constitutional claims are commonly 

brought by taxpayers against Federal taxes, and the 

tax-refund procedure provides a full -- a fully 

effective, fully adequate way of vindicating that right. 

The only requirement is that it be submitted in writing 

to the IRS within three years after filing the tax 

return in question.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you know, what happened 

before the Tucker Act with inverse condemnation claims? 

The government violates the Fifth Amendment Takings 

Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment Takings Clause 

applied to the Fifth by inverse condemnation, and there 

is no Tucker Act. Was there a constitutional cause of 

action for damages?

 MR. JAY: Before there was the Tucker Act, 

Your Honor, when the government took property and was 

obliged to pay compensation, the claim was presented to 

Congress; and Congress could legislative relief by a 

private bill.

 Eventually, Congress created the Court of 

Claims purely as an Article I tribunal. There was no 

judicial review because the decisions were always 

subject to revision by Congress. And eventually 

Congress, having tired of adjudicating all these claims 

in a legislative manner, gave the Court of Claims

independent status with its decisions reviewable in 

Article III courts. And so, by enacting the Tucker Act, 

takings claims became brought in the Court of Federal 

Claims.

 So, because we think Section 7422(a) is a 

completely adequate remedy for any constitutional claim 

that Respondents might bring, we submit that this 

Court's Bivens cases and this Court's unlawful-tax cases 

show that there is no warrant to create a new cause of 

action directly under the Constitution in circumstances 

like this where the taxpayer has a fully effective 

remedy, allows that remedy to become time-barred, but 

instead brings a claim, purportedly under the 

Constitution, against the identical defendant, in the 

identical forum seeking the identical relief. Under 

those circumstances, this Court has never fashioned a 

Bivens-type implied cause of action for a violation of 

the Constitution.

 Indeed, in Bush versus Lucas, Schweiker 

versus Chilicky, and other cases, the Court has 

recognized that when Congress has legislated a remedial 

scheme, it doesn't -- this Court will still stay its 

hand before creating a new Bivens action, even if that 

remedial scheme has very short time limits, such as the 

30-day time limit, the civil service remedies that were

at issue in Bush, or the exhaustion requirement of Title 

VII which substitutes for an equal-protection claim for 

Federal employees.

 Even in those circumstances, and even if the 

remedies that are available are equitable and not money 

damages, even in those circumstances this Court will not 

create a new cause of action for money damages. And in 

this case, if Respondents had filed in a timely way in 

this -- referring to the relief that they're seeking in 

this case, they're seeking relief for 1994, 1995 and 

1996. If they had filed by April 30th, 1997, by which 

point Cyprus Amex Coal Company was already vigorously 

litigating the constitutionality of the Cole excise tax 

in the Court of Federal Claims, if they had filed by 

that time, they could have received full relief.

 So their failure to assert their rights in a 

timely way certainly didn't give the court of appeals 

warrant to create a new Bivens-type implied right of 

action.

 If the Court has no further questions at 

this time, I'll reserve.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 MR. JAY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. MILLETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This is a question of statutory construction 

and the problem, as this Court's precedent has made 

clear in Enochs versus Williams Packing, is that if 

government -- if the government wants to enjoy the 

special, extraordinary protections of the tax-refund 

scheme, it has to assert a plausible basis for tax 

liability. It hasn't done that here. There was never 

any claim that they have any legitimate right to this 

revenue as a source, as a basis, for taxes; that they 

have any legitimate tax regulatory power over this 

export process; or that they have any legitimate basis 

for defending the statute as constitutional under any 

circumstances of the law --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Millett, if it was --

if it was that obvious, why did it take so long for the 

coal companies to realize that the government owed them 

money?

 MS. MILLETT: Justice Stevens, that's 

because my clients are not Fortune 100 companies, and I 

don't think the Constitution or the Congress imposes a 

tax or tax code that require that sort of level of 

scrutiny.

I've got -- we've clients here that are 

small. They have no in-house lawyers and they had 

accountants who paid the taxes. And so the short answer 

is they didn't notice.

 It's not that they looked at it and thought 

it was constitutional. One thing that is clear is that 

as soon as anybody looked at this statute, as soon as 

anybody -- the courts, the government that collected the 

tax for 20 years and did have a constitutional duty to 

look at the Constitution, as soon as anyone looked at 

it, there was no defense offered. This is an 

extraordinary case, where the government made no effort 

to defend this tax whatsoever in district court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were there any other cases 

where they said, well, it's not in the stream of 

commerce yet, and there was an intermediate broker, or 

anything like that? Are there any complexities like 

that?

 MS. MILLETT: Justice Kennedy, there is a 

statutory definition, 26 U.S.C. 1421, that deals with 

stream of commerce and it mirrors this Court's decision 

in the A.G. Spalding case, which says that either the 

direct sales or if your manufacturer doesn't sell 

directly to the exporter or it has the broker, so one or 

two steps, is stream of commerce, and after that it's

not going to be. That's the same thing this Court did 

in A.G. Spaulding.

 If someone wanted to fight about that 

statutory application, they wouldn't be raising a 

constitutional claim like we are here. What happened --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in none of these cases 

did they have those sorts of problems?

 MS. MILLETT: Not in these cases. My 

clients -- I think almost in all of the claims they 

directly exported it themselves. There was no dispute 

whatsoever.

 If there's a debate, factually or legally, 

about whether this is the stream -- if it's not in the 

export stream. If it's not in the export stream, it's 

not an export or a violation. If there is a factual 

debate, it wouldn't fall within the Enochs versus 

Williams Packing exception. There was no factual 

debate. There is a stipulated judgment in this case.

 What Enochs tells us, again, is that the 

government can't have a tax be a tax solely for the 

purpose of curtailing constitutional recovery. That's 

the only way that this was a legitimate tax in their 

view, not to collect revenue.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If 7422(a) had said 

any -- any Internal Revenue tax, including a tax imposed

in alleged violation of the Export Clause, that would 

cut -- cut out the six-year statute of limitations, 

right? If it said the refund procedure applies to any 

Internal Revenue tax including one imposed in alleged 

violation of the Export Clause?

 MS. MILLETT: I think it would clear up an 

awful lot. If I could just clarify, though. What this 

court held in Enochs versus William Packing is that the 

phrase "any tax" only applies if the government is at 

least willing to assert a plausible defense for the tax. 

And so it would depend on whether any tax would still 

include that limitation in your scenario, if they are 

willing to assert a plausible Export Clause.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Nothing different from 

what it is now, but just Congress makes clear that a tax 

and alleged violation of the Export Clause falls within 

the term "any Internal Revenue tax"?

 MS. MILLETT: Then I think my position would 

be that it does not, because this Court has held for 

half a century without Congress changing it that any tax 

means a tax that the government asserts is valid. It 

doesn't have to be correct. It has to assert that it's 

valid. Otherwise it's in the guise of a tax and it 

doesn't fall --

valid if this coal was not shipped overseas. You're 

putting an awful burden on the government to know when 

the coal is severed and shipped. You're saying if they 

mistake a shipment as being only for domestic use rather 

than for shipment abroad, they don't have any basis 

whatever for the tax claim. I'm not sure I agree with.

 MS. MILLETT: The problem in this case, 

Justice Scalia, is that there were two statutes. There 

was a statute imposing the coal tax, 26 U.S.C. 4121 --

this is all on the first page of our brief -- and then 

there was an amendment to the exemption for exports in 

26 U.S.C. 4221 that specifically said the general tax 

exemption for exports does not apply to this coal tax, 

and that provision captured nothing but exports of coal.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Your point is that you 

don't have to go through the refund requirements of 7422 

if the government was -- although it did ask for the 

money as a tax, they are really out to lunch? I mean, 

the trouble -- is there any authority for an argument 

like that? I mean, the trouble I guess that I would 

have that argument is, one is linguistic, because it 

goes on to say "or of any sum alleged to have been 

excessive or in any manner wrongfully collected."

 And then the other thing is just common 

sense: Suppose you have an insane tax collector. You

know, I mean, that could happen. And the insane tax 

collector they discover some years later has been 

assessing all these penalties for no reason and people 

have been paying some of them because, terrible tragedy, 

terrible thing. But I guess they'd be stuck, I'd always 

thought, with the three-year statute of limitations, so 

even those it's really nuts.

 Now, is there -- is there any authority for 

us making a distinction between an insane -- to get an 

extreme, an insane assessment of a tax and just a 

wrongful assessment of a tax?

 MS. MILLETT: The authority is this Court's 

unanimous opinion in Enochs versus Williams --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

 MS. MILLETT: -- which said that if -- we 

are dealing with the same language -- no suit shall be 

maintained for any tax in any court. And it said in 

that, that statutory language, "any tax" means something 

that the government can plausibly defend as a tax.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What about the "any sum," 

"in any manner"? You know, what about that language?

 MS. MILLETT: Again, the key language --

JUSTICE BREYER: "Any sum in any manner 

wrongfully collected."

 MS. MILLETT: Right. This Court dealt with

that, I think it's in -- I think in Dalm, and sometimes 

it has its own rules in the taxing, but this is -- the 

question is any tax, and any tax doesn't mean something 

that's just in the guise of tax, whether the guy is 

insane or Congress just forgot to read the Export 

Clause. But as soon as we look, everyone knows this is 

unconstitutional, then understand what the impact of 

that is. That means the only way this is a legitimate 

tax under the government's rule, the only legitimate tax 

function that this serves is to cut off constitutional 

remedies. That's its only role.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No. No. Their argument 

is, I'm terribly sorry, that if the way you're hurt is 

you paid a tax you shouldn't pay and you want to get a 

refund, go through the administrative procedure.

 MS. MILLETT: This Court said in Enochs that 

you don't -- that tax -- the whole point of the Tax 

Exemption Act is to funnel everybody in for tax refund 

procedure. And this court said you don't have to go if 

it is not a tax. And what they mean by not a tax, is 

that it can't plausibly be defended by the government as 

a tax. This doesn't happen often. This is an 

extraordinary exception. But this is the case where it 

did. And if the government --

take it, though, that you concede the six-year statute 

of limitations under the Tucker Act, right? I mean, 

your brief says this is an unbending and unqualified 

prohibition on the use of exports except up to -- if 

it's before six years and one day. You are taking an 

adamant position with respect to three years but you 

give up six years.

 MS. MILLETT: No. It's unbending and wrong 

whether it's within six years or ten years. But we 

agree that a constitutional right can have a statute of 

limitation -- if there is a constitutional right that 

doesn't have any statute of limitations, I don't know 

what it is and it's not this one. The question is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why aren't three years 

enough?

 MS. MILLETT: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why aren't three years 

enough?

 MS. MILLETT: Because it's a question of 

statutory construction. And Congress determined what 

the right statute of limitation is for a constitutional 

claim, and that's six years. If Congress had a 

three-year statute of limitations under the Tucker Act 

for all constitutional claims, we wouldn't be here.

rhetoric in your brief how this is a constitutionally 

based prohibition is not pertinent? You're saying if 

the statute was clear and it said three years, that 

would be fine, even though it's a claim under the Export 

Clause?

 MS. MILLETT: We don't -- to the Export 

Clause, right, distinguishes between three years and six 

years in its own right. What the Export Clause does, 

though, there is the statutory construction argument and 

we have the Enochs argument, but we also think there are 

substantial constitutional concerns here. And the 

Export Clause makes it most imperative for this Court to 

continue to adhere to its definition of any tax, and 

that's because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is the Export Clause 

so, so significant? The only other self-executing 

constitutional clause that provides for damages 

automatically that comes to mind is the Takings Clause. 

And we have allowed the states to require claimants to 

jump through innumerable hoops. They have to exhaust 

all their administrative remedies before they can bring 

a suit here. Why -- why is the Export Clause any -- any 

more sacrosanct?

 MS. MILLETT: Because we don't -- under the 

Constitution the government hasn't done anything wrong

unless -- until -- unless and until it actually effects 

a taking and doesn't pay for it through process.  Those 

processes are how we determine -- get to the point where 

there has been an actual constitutional violation here.

 No administrative process is necessary to 

have -- to know that tax has been posed on exports. And 

what's distinct about the Export Clause, to get back to 

Chief Justice Roberts' question, is that it is -- this 

Court said unanimously in U.S. Shoe, a simple, direct, 

unqualified prohibition on congressional tax power in 

terms, and it disallows any effort to raise revenue 

through the Tax Power Act.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Volenti non fit injuria. 

If indeed the taxpayer pays out the money for an 

unconstitutional export tax, it seems to me that person 

has no claim until he complies with the administrative 

procedures that render that tax unconstitutional. But 

up until the point where he is paying it voluntarily, it 

seems to me there is no constitutional violation.

 MS. MILLETT: Congress eliminated in the 

early 1920s any prepayment protest requirement under the 

tax law. And the tax law -- the Internal Revenue Code 

applies sweepingly to Americans across this country, 

vast majority of whom are not equipped with tax lawyers 

at their side to make protests at the moment they pay

their taxes. That's never been required.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not saying it has to be 

made at the moment they pay their taxes. I'm just 

saying until it's made there is no unconstitutional, 

unconstitutional export tax.

 MS. MILLETT: That's right. Until the tax 

-- well, it would be an unconstitutional statute on the 

books. No one has been injured by it or affected by it 

until somebody actually pays it or is required by the 

government to pay it. I don't dispute that, but keep in 

mind we're dealing with a tax refund scheme. The tax 

refund scheme is an extraordinary creature in the law 

for many good reasons but that -- that reverses the 

order of everything. It makes you pay before any 

entitlement has been shown to that money by the 

government.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you didn't have 

to pay --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Here there was a payment. 

Here there was a payment.

work.

 MS. MILLETT: It's only different in the 

sense that government's interests are less, and the 

government's interests are most acute in having people 

pointed to the tax-refund scheme, this Court has said 

time and again, before -- to pay first and fight later. 

And as a result -- I mean, if it's most acute --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what about the 

deficiency procedure? And I don't know if that applies 

with excise taxes, but suppose they didn't pay this tax 

and they get a notice of deficiency. Where would they 

go?

 MS. MILLETT: There -- there's nowhere for 

them to go for this particular tax. You can't go to tax 

court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not?

 MS. MILLETT: Because tax court doesn't 

apply to excise taxes for the most part. There may be a 

few exceptions. It essentially applies to income gift 

and estate taxes, and it certainly didn't apply to this 

provision here. They could have -- they could have 

gotten the assessment and gotten on the phone with an 

IRS. Otherwise they'd have to wait for a lien or levy.

court and enjoin them. It's not a tax. The Tax 

Injunction Act doesn't apply.

Justice Ginsburg's questions point out. And earlier I 

had indicated that in this case they did pay the tax.

 MS. MILLETT: I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seems to me there is 

a distinction. It may be that you would prevail in your 

argument.

 MS. MILLETT: I know. We couldn't have --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If they tried -- if they 

tried -- do you think they could enjoin the collection 

of a tax refund?

 MS. MILLETT: No, they couldn't because in 

addition to showing the government's imposition of the 

tax is legally indefensible, you still have to show 

entitlement to an injunction, and unless you can 

establish irreparable harm just by paying money, which 

I'm not aware of any coal company that could have, you 

could have gotten an injunction. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, I mean, in your 

argument you say it is absolutely -- that it doesn't 

apply. Just get an injunction.

MS. MILLETT: You can't get an injunction 

just because something is unlawful. That's never been 

allowed under equity. You also have to show irreparable 

harm.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then we'll invent 

the hypothetical company that is going to go broke and 

all that stuff.

 MS. MILLETT: But I mean, it's not a 

question of inventing. This Court dealt with exactly 

that question in Enochs, where -- Enochs versus Williams 

Packing, and later again in South Carolina versus Regan, 

and Commissioner versus Shapiro -- that you can't just 

come in and say it's unlawful, that you actually have to 

then establish irreparable harm. Everything in the tax 

scheme points to taxpayers with enormous penalties and 

enormous risks to pay first, fight later. And when a 

taxpayer does that, it's also --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you can't have it both 

ways. You're saying it isn't a tax for your purposes, 

and then in my hypothetical case you say you have to go 

through the tax law.

 MS. MILLETT: It's the government that --

MS. MILLETT: It's the government that wants 

to have it both ways. It wants to say it is a tax just 

for purposes of making it a nonconstitutional case under 

the Tucker Act and to make it the tax scheme, but in no 

way is this defensible as a tax.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In looking at your 

argument, I see it now, I think, if I'm right. You're 

-- that it would have very broad reach. It would reach 

-- it doesn't just concern the constitutional claim; it 

concerns any claim you'd have against the IRS. And 

there's authority that says if the IRS' position is too 

far out, you can go get an injunction. That's what 

you're pointing to. And then you're argument is, 

because of that authority, that kind of an exception for 

the far out IRS claim also applies to the statute of 

limitation and administrative requirement. And your 

problem is the latter has never been held. And the 

reason that that's a problem, I take it, is because when 

you're talking about injunctions, you're talking about 

basic equity, but when you're talking about later on 

administrative requirements, there's really no reason 

they couldn't have filed the claim. And if we were to 

accept an argument on the -- to the contrary and 

analogize it, it's going to cut through rules, 

regulations, statutes, constitutional claims,

everything, really making a hash of their provision 

there -- of the administrative provision. So, what is 

your response to that thought which --

MS. MILLETT: I have two responses: One, 

it's going to have far less effect on this situation, in 

the post-payment situation, than it did in Enochs, where 

it wasn't limited to the Export Clause. This situation 

is only going to work where you not only establish the 

government has no basis for this tax, a hard thing to 

do, but that you have a money-mandating constitutional 

provision. There aren't many of them. If you don't 

have a money-mandating position, you've got nowhere else 

to go but the tax scheme.

 So it's extremely limited, but I want to get 

back -- this is not about an equity rule. This Court 

was specific in Enochs versus Williams Packing, when it 

said, our prior decision under Miller versus Standard 

Nut, in which you had done a more generous view of this 

get around the Tax Injunction Act, was wrong, because 

the Tax Injunction Act is not an equitable rule. Enochs 

was a statutory construction rule. Pages 6, 7, and 8 of 

that decision make it plain in terms -- you talk about 

what the act requires, and the language of this Court is 

construing is the phrase "any tax." And if it has no 

legitimate basis, then it's in the guise of a tax.

That same language has been on the books for 

almost half a century. Congress went back from the Tax 

Injunction Act eight times without changing it in 

response to this Court's decisions. Enochs has been 

reaffirmed by this Court five times. Congress enacted 

an entirely new Internal Revenue Code in 1986 that used 

that "any tax" language in 7422, with this Court's five 

decisions on the book and kept that language. And it 

makes sense. Congress doesn't -- doesn't enact a tax 

where it's only tax function --

JUSTICE BREYER: What do you want to do 

about your argument, as I hear it, has nothing to do 

with the nature of the claim that you're asserting to 

get the money back. It has to do with the nature of the 

IRS's defense and -- well, can you do it that way? Can 

you say the word "any tax" or "any claim" -- I can't 

remember that other. What was it? It was any -- "any 

sum" -- "any sum" or "any tax." Can you say, well, it 

means one thing if they are saying that the reason they 

want it back is that it violates the Constitution, and 

those words mean a different thing if the reason that 

you want it back is it violates an IRS reg; it violates 

an IRS statute.

 MS. MILLETT: I'm not saying that "any tax" 

means anything different. I'm just pointing out that if

you succeed --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if it doesn't mean 

anything different and then if the very far-out claim to 

a tax is so far out it isn't a tax, that would be true 

in the regulation context, in the statutory context as 

well as the constitutional context. Am I missing 

something?

 MS. MILLETT: No, because you have to have a 

money-mandating claim under the Constitution to fall 

within the Tucker Act. The -- this Court said, the 

Tucker Act for purposes of the statutory claims under 

the Internal Revenue Code, as this court said in 

Kreider, takes three years to the statute of 

limitations. So I don't think, after Kreider, that you 

would still have a six-year statute of limitations under 

the Tucker Act for a statutory tax claim.

 The difference is constitutional 

enforcement, and this is fundamentally a constitutional 

right that's being enforced. And the question is, would 

Congress had thought -- this is all a question of 

statutory construction -- would Congress have thought 

this is more a constitutional claim or a tax claim? And 

they've made the sensible decision, at least as this 

Court construed it in Enochs, in South Carolina versus 

Regan -- addressed it in Janis and Bob Jones University

and the Americans United case, all of which are in our 

brief --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're saying it's 

both. You're not saying it's "either/or" because for 

three years you did use the refund procedure. So you 

used the refund procedure for the years that were within 

the three-year period, and then for the years that were 

outside the three-year period, you have this other 

theory. So you're not saying this is not for refund. 

That route is closed. The only route is this 

constitutional -- this claim directly under the Export 

Clause. But your own conduct seems to have been it's 

our option. We can treat it as a refund claim or we can 

treat it as a constitutional claim.

 MS. MILLETT: One can get -- there is 

nothing in the tax administrative scheme where one when 

shows up to file a tax refund where you say if I go by 

this route, I'm waiving all others. It's not like I'm 

agreeing to go go through arbitration and forgoing my 

rights to go through a court procedure. Congress has --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In other words, what were 

you just telling us is that this is not a refund claim; 

this is a constitutional claim. But you are now saying, 

I think, that it's both; it's whatever the taxpayer or 

the plaintiff wants it to be.

MS. MILLETT: It's a constitutional claim to 

get your tax money back. That's right. And the 

administrative scheme is fully amenable to that. That's 

certainly the government's position, and we don't 

disagree. The question is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Plus you get 

interest.

 MS. MILLETT: Yes. Absolutely. We could 

get it on both grounds, but you get --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're saying you get 

interest too in either way. You're saying -- I thought 

you said for the three years that are within the 

three-year refund limit, you get interest and then 

you're also saying, going back six years, you also get 

interest. You're not saying that if you -- if you're 

outside the refund procedure you don't get interest.

 MS. MILLETT: Right. But that's because 

we're -- I mean, there's a -- there's a separate 

interest provision in the tax code for the 

administrative refund procedure. They don't really an 

28 U.S.C. 2411. I think it's 26 U.S.C. 6511. But 

there's a specific administrative brief on tax -- I'm 

sorry, interest provision for the administrative refund 

scheme. And so, under that, when you're in the 

administrative scheme, you get what the administrative

scheme's interest provision gives you. We don't dispute 

that.

 And then the question is, once you've gone 

to court, the relevant interest provision is the one in 

28 U.S.C., not in the tax code, by the way, but in 28 

U.S.C., providing them -- providing for interest when 

you've recovered an overpayment of taxes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the interest the same 

in amount in either case?

 MS. MILLETT: Yes, because in 2411 it 

cross-references the -- well, let me clarify. There is 

one potential wrinkle, but generally speaking 2411 if 

you look at it, and it's at the end of the 

cross-references --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: 2411 -- 2411 is what you 

use in the court when you have a straight tax refund 

claim. It's not as though 2411 is there for some other 

claim. It's what you get when you go to court and 

you're suing for a refund. That's 2411. That's 

applicable if you get a judgment for an overpayment in 

respect of any Internal Revenue tax. That's what --

it's in Title 28, but that's what it's for. It's for an 

overpayment in respect of any Internal Revenue tax.

 MS. MILLETT: This is all on page 4a of the 

Government's brief if you want to see where it

cross-references the Internal Revenue interest 

provisions.

 No, there's nothing there that says you have 

to have gone through the administrative scheme. All you 

have to have is an overpayment. If you have an 

overpayment, under Bonwit Teller --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- the use of any 

Internal Revenue tax, and your whole argument is this 

isn't an Internal Revenue tax. So it's clearly not an 

Internal Revenue tax that you have a constitutional 

claim directly under the Constitution, so how does it 

become for purposes of 2411 an Internal Revenue tax?

 MS. MILLETT: I'm sorry, I misunderstood 

your question, Justice Ginsburg. But I want to make 

clear that you don't have to go through the refund 

scheme to get this. This interest would apply in Bonwit 

Teller for accounts stated, in the Rosenman case for 

deposit on taxes. That's how we read it.

 Your second point, yes, that if we say this 

is not a plausible tax under Enochs versus Williams, 

that I think, and if this Court agrees, that this is not 

a tax under Enochs versus Williams, so that we're not 

bound by 7422, then I agree that our interest argument 

becomes harder at that point textually.

 I will tell you that I still think the fact

that they say "in respect of any Internal Revenue tax" 

gives us room to say that where the government has at 

least treated it and collected the money as though it 

were an Internal Revenue tax, that might be a way to get 

interest. If this Court agrees, though, that it's 

not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you don't agree in 

your basic claim that if the government is treating it 

as an Internal Revenue tax, which it certainly didn't, 

you'd say that works only for the interest, not --

MS. MILLETT: Only -- I'm sorry. Only 

because we have the "in respect of language." That's 

the only -- but if this Court disagrees with that, and 

we recognize it's harder if this Court agreed, we have a 

separate constitutional argument that the Export Clause, 

just like the Just Compensation Clause requires interest 

paid in its own right. And so that's the alternative 

basis.

 And this Court, of course, can affirm the 

judgment on any basis supported by the record.

 But I want to get back. Very clearly that 

there is, the bottom -- I mean, Justice Scalia, you 

talked about, you know, which pot you want to put this 

in. The rarity of this case and what's unique about it 

is that the government came in agreeing up front,

stipulated judgment, no fact dispute, no law disputes, 

this is in the pot of no legitimate status of the tax. 

No claim whatsoever. The government couldn't think of 

anything.

 But for purposes of limiting your 

constitutional relief, then it's in the pot of a 

legitimate. Tax and we think they can't have it both, 

ways and particularly as a matter of statutory 

construction. This is ultimately a question of which 

scheme is better fitted to vindicating the Constitution. 

And Congress said any tax, just like it said in the Tax 

Injunction Act. This court has said what any tax means. 

It said it five times after Enochs. And Congress has 

not reacted to it.

 Stare decisis applies most powerfully in the 

statutory construction Congress -- context, and if 

Congress thought there were a problem with what -- with 

how this Court defined any tax, it would have said so. 

It could have done so. It's had half a century to do 

something.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You give all of this 

up when it comes to the statute of limitations. I mean, 

the government's argument could be just as implausible 

as you suggested it is here. But if it involves a claim 

six years and one day out, it's just too bad. It

doesn't matter that it's a constitutional claim. It 

doesn't matter how erroneous the government's position 

was, because the government can impose limitations like 

that even on the assertion of constitutional claims. 

That's all they are doing here.

 MS. MILLETT: But the Tucker Act doesn't use 

the "word any tax" in defining the statute of 

limitations. It's a statute of limitations for 

constitutional claims.

 Our argument is what the word "any tax" 

means in 7422 and does it force us to go through the tax 

refund scheme. Our argument is, as this Court said 

unanimously in Enochs -- the decision has never been 

questioned by any justice of this court -- that any tax 

does not apply if it had no tax status for any other 

purpose. It can't be just to limit --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We say just as 

unanimously a couple of things last year on -- term as 

well in Jencks and certainly the Federal circuit's 

decision wouldn't have come out the same if they had had 

Hinck's term of trust on the books.

it would have come out differently. Maybe they would 

have explained things differently. But this Court said 

in most cases the question is which statutory scheme is

better fitted. And at two levels we think the Tucker 

Act is better fitted for this claim.

 One, because any tax only applies when there 

is asserted legitimate basis for the tax; and two, the 

Export Clause is a unique limitation, specifically 

denies the government any authority to use exports as a 

source of revenue. And you have a refund scheme here 

that has been designed over the years specifically to 

protect revenue interest, to make you pay the revenue 

first and have them hold it.

 It's not just holding them for six months. 

They had to pay every two weeks. But, of course, the 

government didn't treat that as paid for purposes of 

interest until the end of the quarter when a return was 

filed. That's one way why the interest calculation 

might be different under the Tucker Act than it would be 

under the refund scheme, just the timing of whether it's 

the deposit or the actual return.

 Justice Kennedy, I forgot to get back to you 

on that.

 But the question here is whether the Export 

Clause can be fully enforced by -- which it's -- it's 

not a suggestion and it doesn't say when you're doing 

your tax stuff, it's okay if you slop on on exports a 

little bit. Exports are completely off limits to the

tax power. And Congress using its tax power to create a 

tax scheme that specifically preserves and protects 

revenue and is not a revenue neutral system is not the 

best scheme for vindicating the Export Clause. It's not 

better for that. It is at cross purposes with the 

Export Clause.

 But the bottom is this Court doesn't need to 

get to that constitutional question. We think it 

certainly informs the analysis. It certainly is enough 

of a constitutional concern or doubt to conclude that 

Enochs still applies any tax in the tax injunction --

any tax in any court. No suit shall be maintained for 

any tax in any court means the same thing in 7422 that 

it means in the Tax Injunction Act. If Congress thought 

it meant something different, it has had half -- almost 

half a century to tell us.

 It hasn't done that, and the Export Clause 

can't serve its unique historical function of keeping 

government's tax regulatory hands off -- hands off the 

tax export process and the revenue out of the Federal 

Fiske unless this is treated as a constitutional claim.

minutes, you will state what the government's position 

is on this Enochs case that's been mentioned at least a

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. JAY: I'll be glad to, Your Honor. 

Enochs case construed not Section 7422, but Section 

7421, the Injunction Act provision of the tax code. And 

the question in Enochs was whether the taxpayer simply 

by alleging that the tax was so -- so invalidly applied 

that it was only in the guise of the tax could avoid 

paying the tax and bring an injunctive claim.

 The court in Enochs held that it could not 

because the taxpayer had not, in fact, satisfied the 

basic requirement of all claims for injunctive relief as 

irreparable injury. And the court also held that 

whether a tax is defensible for purposes of this very 

narrow exception is to be determined on the basis of the 

information to the government at the time of suit. So 

in this --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait what very narrow 

exception? It didn't apply the exception.

 MR. JAY: As the Court was preserving, I 

think, in Dick, though, because -- because the Court 

ultimately denied the exception in that case and in each

case since, preserving the holding in Standard Nut and 

Margarine, a case from the 1920's. Justice Breyer 

alluded to this when he asked my friend, Ms. Millett, 

about whether this exception is geared primarily to 

factual issues or to legal issues. In Standard Nut and 

Margarine the government had decided to attempt to 

impose a tax meant for oleomargarine on a product made 

entirely from nuts. And this Court, you know, without 

construing the tax-injunctive provision, simply 

referring to principles of equity, this Court held that 

the government's theory of assessing the tax was simply 

in the guise of a tax and it permitted the injunctive 

claim to proceed.

 In Williams Packing the government's -- the 

government had a collateral basis for assessing the tax, 

and so the taxpayer was remitted to the same remedy that 

any taxpayer who wants to challenge a tax as having been 

unlawfully assessed or collected is subject to; that is, 

to pay the tax, file a refund claim, and if the refund 

claim is upheld either by the IRS or subsequently in 

court, to receive a full refund with interest.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't the two go together? 

If you could bring an injunction action, surely you 

don't have to pay the tax.

 MR. JAY: Well, if you can satisfy the

requirements for injunctive relief -- and Williams 

Packing, the taxpayer, couldn't; and in the cases since 

the taxpayer couldn't -- then the court can enjoin the 

collection of the taxes applied to you.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's what she is 

saying. She is saying that those conditions exist here. 

That this is not -- not a plausible tax; and, therefore, 

she could have gotten an injunction; and, therefore, by 

a parity of reasoning, she doesn't have to go through 

the tax provisions.

 MR. JAY: I think I have three responses to 

that.

 One is that we don't think that a -- an 

exception to the -- to 7421 should carry over into 

Section 7422. But even in the circumstances of this 

case, this is a facially constitutional tax. The tax is 

imposed on coal mined in the United States. And if no 

-- if none of the coal that is subject to the tax is 

ever in the stream of export when the tax is imposed, 

then the tax is perfectly constitutional. And that is 

why Section 4121 remains on the books today.

 The tax is unconstitutional only in certain 

narrow circumstances when the coal actually is is in the 

stream of export. As I explained --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you could say the

same about the tax on oleomargarine. It is a perfectly 

valid tax but not when you impose it on nuts. And here 

the tax on coal is a perfectly valid tax, but not when 

you impose it on coal that's in the stream of export.

 MR. JAY: But if one of these coal companies 

had sought to enjoin the tax, the government would have 

pointed to the provision in Williams Packing that says 

that whether the tax is defensible is to be determined 

on the basis of the information available to the 

government at the time of suit until the taxpayer 

demonstrates that the coal is actually in the stream of 

export, which is precisely what's done during the refund 

process that the taxpayers used in this case to show 

that their coal was in the stream of export when they 

obtained the refund. That's what -- that's how they 

obtained a full -- full relief.

 But, in any event, the history of this 

litigation shows that this is not -- this is not a claim 

about the facial unconstitutionality of the tax because 

the tax continued to be collected without protest in the 

case of the Respondents here for 21 consecutive years.

 And by the time they filed for a refund this 

Court had decided IBM. It had decided U.S. shoe. The 

district court had decided Ranger Fuel, and the 

government had announced that it would not appeal the

decision in Ranger Fuel striking down the coal tax.

 But that doesn't mean that for that -- for 

that entire time the government had no basis on which to 

defend the tax. I mean the government had colorful 

arguments to defend the tax at issue in U.S. Shoe in 

June 1996. Shoe was in 1996. And it had colorful 

arguments to defend the harbor maintenance tax in U.S. 

Shoe. I may have misspoke. IBM in 1996, and U.S. Shoe 

in 1998.

 So to say that during the period at issue in 

this case, 1994 through 1996, the tax was so facially 

invalid that the narrow Williams Packing exception to 

another statutory provision justifies Respondents' 

attempt to circumvent the tax refund statute, we just 

think is not correct.

 In the case of a taxpayer who -- who can 

satisfy the exception, you know, the Tax Code does, 

indeed, put that taxpayer to the choice. It gives them 

a fully effective post- payment refund remedy where they 

can avoid any penalties and interest by paying the tax 

and litigating for a full refund.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. Is the government's 

view that the money that they are seeking here, if you 

look at 7422, that it falls within the language of any 

Internal Revenue tax alleged to be erroneously or

illegally assessed or the language "any sum alleged to 

have been in any manner wrongfully collected," or both?

 MR. JAY: I don't think that we need to go 

beyond the first clause, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So when I decide this case, 

I should forget the words "any sum"?

 MR. JAY: I mean the Court construed a 

similar provision in Flora versus United States in 1960, 

which explained that "any sum" is a cumulative 

provision. So that if something is within the scope of 

an Internal Revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously 

or illegally collected or assessed, that's as far as you 

need to go.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But it means that if, in 

fact, it is not within the scope of the word "tax," then 

it is not within "any sum"?

 MR. JAY: No. To the contrary, Your Honor. 

I think that the holding in Flora is that if it's not 

within the scope of the first provision, then you would 

need to look at the second -- actually the third 

provision, the "any sum" language.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In Enochs -- she is quite 

right, your opposing lawyer -- it says the exaction is 

merely in the guise of a tax. And when it says it is 

within the guise of a tax, then it doesn't fall within

the Tax Injunction Act.

 And there it says if it is clear that under 

no circumstances could the government ultimately 

prevail, the central purpose of the Tax Injunction Act 

is inapplicable. And then it's just in the guise of a 

tax. And that, she says, is the test we should apply 

here. So that's where I think Justice Ginsburg began.

 What is your specific response to that?

 MR. JAY: Well, my specific response, Your 

Honor, first is that in this case the tax simply was not 

in the guise of a tax. But even if, you know, today, if 

the taxpayer were -- if a taxpayer were alleging that 

the coal tax were in the guise of a tax and that it, 

therefore, could bring a prepayment -- a prepayment 

action, it does not then follow that the taxpayer could 

still after the fact, if it opted not to bring that 

prepayment action, the taxpayer could then escape the 

three-year, nontollable, unusually emphatic limitation 

period that applies to a claim for a postpayment remedy, 

which is the exclusive means of obtaining a postpayment 

remedy.

 And, you know, the courts recognized time 

and again that taxing authorities have a strong interest 

in fiscal stability, and it effectively closes the books 

on a particular tax year. So that taxpayers, after the

tax is paid, if they want to protest the tax, they have 

three years in which to put the government on notice. 

That, you know, even if the claim is this tax is so 

beyond the pale that it can't be defended, they have to 

put the government on notice of that claim.

 And if they do, then the IRS considers it; 

and if the IRS turns them down, then they can proceed to 

district court or to the Court of Federal Claims.

 In addition, I think I just wanted to 

clarify one point about the availability of prepayment 

remedies in this case. I think, Justice Ginsburg, my 

friend, Miss Millett, was correct about the fact that 

this excise tax does not -- is not susceptible to the 

deficiency proceeding in tax court.

 And we have cited in footnote 7 of our reply 

brief at page 16 the possibility that there may be 

another route if the taxpayer feels strongly about the 

unconstitutionality of the tax and is willing to take 

the chance that if the taxpayer's position is rejected, 

that the taxpayer may be liable for penalties and 

interest for not paying the tax.

 I mean, of course, the general rule is that 

the taxpayer is expected to pay the tax and proceed 

postpayment by putting the IRS on notice of the claim. 

But Congress, in Section 6330(c)(2)(B) of Title 26, has

provided some limited ability, if a taxpayer has not 

previously been able to litigate the merits of the tax, 

the taxpayer has a limited opportunity to do so first 

before the IRS, then in Tax Court, and then before the 

Court of Appeals.

 And, again, on Miss Millett's supposition 

that this is a completely, clearly unconstitutional tax, 

then the taxpayer would have the option of doing that. 

Again, the refund scheme is set up so that if the 

taxpayer doesn't want to take the chance that its 

argument will not be accepted, the taxpayer has a 

simple, open remedy: To file a refund claim at any 

point within three years.

 That's exactly what Respondents did not do 

for the 21 consecutive years that they paid this tax 

without complaint.

 If the Court has no further questions?
