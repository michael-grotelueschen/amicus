(11:06 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-1332, the City of 

Ontario v. Quon. 

Mr. Richland. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. RICHLAND: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Under the less restrictive constitutional 

standards applied when government acts as employer, as 

opposed to sovereign, there was no Fourth Amendment 

violation here. 

First, Ontario Police Sergeant Jeff Quon had 

no reasonable expectation of privacy vis-à-vis the 

Ontario Police Department in text messages on his 

department-issued pager in light of the operational 

realities of his workplace, which included the explicit 

no privacy in text messages policy. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The written policy? 

(Laughter.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The whole -- the 

argument here, of course, is that that was modified by 

the instructions he got from the lieutenant. Do we

follow the written policy or the policy they allegedly 

enforced in practice? 

MR. RICHLAND: That is the argument, 

Mr. Chief Justice. But, in fact, there was no 

inconsistency between the no privacy in text messages 

aspect of the written policy and the oral information 

he was given. 

First of all, the written policy itself was 

broad enough to cover text messages. It stated, for 

example, at Appendix 152, that it applied to city-owned 

computers and all associated equipment. And again at 

152: "City-owned computer equipment, computer 

peripheral, city networks, the Internet, e-mail, or 

other city-related computer services." And, finally, the 

agreement to the policy was that it applied -- this is 

at Appendix 156 -- to city-owned computers and related 

equipment. 

So certainly the written policy itself was 

broad enough to cover text messaging pagers, but in 

addition to that, nothing in the oral statements made by 

Lieutenant Duke undermined the no-privacy aspect of the 

written policy. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we are dealing 

with Mr. Quon's reasonable expectations, right? 

MR. RICHLAND: Yes, yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And even with the 

written policy, he has the instructions -- everybody 

agrees -- you can use this pager for private 

communications. 

MR. RICHLAND: That’s correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’re not going to 

audit them. Right? That's what he said. He has to pay 

for them. Right? Now, most things, if you're paying for 

them, they’re yours. And this -- it particularly covered 

messages off-duty. 

Now, can't you sort of put all those 

together and say that it would be reasonable for him to 

assume that private messages were his business? They 

said he can do it. They said, you’ve got to pay for 

it. He used it off duty. They said they’re not going 

to audit it. 

MR. RICHLAND: Not when he was told at the 

same time that these text messages were considered 

e-mail and could be audited, and that they were 

considered public records and could be audited at any 

time; that is, it has to do with a different aspect of 

what the policy -- the oral policy --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In addition to -- that 

was said at the meeting -- and Lieutenant Duke, who was 

the same one who later says: I'm not going to monitor

as long as you pay the difference. There was the 

statement at the meeting by that same person. Wasn't 

there something in writing by the police chief to follow 

up after that meeting? 

MR. RICHLAND: Yes, there was, 

Justice Ginsburg. There was a memo that was sent that 

memorialized the statements at the meeting, that 

specifically stated that the text messages were treated 

as e-mail under the written policy. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me ask you --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me ask you to 

put the written policy aside. Hypothetical case: There’s 

no written policy. Would he have a reasonable 

expectation in the privacy of his personal e-mail, text 

messages, in that case? 

MR. RICHLAND: Not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, 

all we know is the list that I went through earlier. 

MR. RICHLAND: Yes. Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Assuming all the other factors in this case were 

present --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 

MR. RICHLAND: That is, he is using his 

department-issued pager; he is a police officer and

indeed a member of the high-profile SWAT team of the 

police department. He should be aware just by virtue of 

that fact that there is going to be litigation involving 

incidents that the SWAT team gets involved in where there 

will be requests for the communications that are made on 

that official department-issued pager. 

And, in addition, he should be aware of the 

fact -- and this is something that the dissenters to 

denial of en banc said below. He should be aware that 

there may be inquiries from boards of the police to 

determine whether the conduct of the police in a particular 

incident is appropriate. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Richland, a little 

earlier you referred us to page 152 and 156 of --

MR. RICHLAND: Of the appendix to the 

petition. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, the appendix to the 

petition. 

MR. RICHLAND: Yes, and that's the policy. 

That is the written policy, Justice Scalia. I'm sorry 

for the confusion. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that’s the 

written policy. 

MR. RICHLAND: That is the written policy, 

and the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the policy 

itself, from the point of view of Officer Quon, is a 

little bit more complicated than that. 

MR. RICHLAND: Well, of course, what the --

what Officer Quon's point of view is must also be 

tempered by what we are reasonably going to accept as a 

society of his understanding of the circumstances. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would agree, I 

think, that if the SCA, the Stored Communications Act --

MR. RICHLAND: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If that made it illegal 

to disclose these e-mails, then he would certainly be correct 

that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy; isn't that 

right? 

MR. RICHLAND: No, Mr. Chief Justice. We 

would not agree with that. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not reasonable 

to assume that people are going to follow the law? 

MR. RICHLAND: Well, for several reasons. 

Number one, this Court has repeatedly stated that the 

mere fact that something is contrary to the law does not 

in itself permit a reasonable expectation of privacy. 

Just two terms ago, in Virginia v. Moore, this Court 

said precisely that. And of course it said it earlier

in California v. Greenwood, and in a number of other 

cases -- Oliver v. United States. 

Because the effect of that, of course, would 

mean that we would be constitutionalizing every positive 

law that might be enacted by a State or the 

Federal legislature. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on that point, do we 

take it as the law of the case or as a given that it was 

illegal for I think Arch to turn over the transcripts to 

the police department? What do we do with that part of 

the case? 

MR. RICHLAND: Justice Kennedy, I don’t 

believe it is law of the case that is binding on this 

Court, since this Court is a higher court. Although it 

is true that this Court denied certiorari on that issue, 

I don't believe it is bound by the Ninth Circuit 

determination of that, and in fact it is our contention 

that that was incorrectly decided. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: On remand -- has there been 

a final judgment issued as to Arch, or is that just 

being held --

MR. RICHLAND: I don't believe so, 

Justice Kennedy. I believe that everything has been 

stayed pending the determination by this Court.

that in this police department, everyone knew, the 

supervisors and everyone else, that the police 

department people spoke to their girlfriends at night. 

MR. RICHLAND: Yes, Justice Sotomayor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And one of the chiefs, 

out of salacious interest, decides: I'm going to just 

go in and get those texts, those messages, because I 

just have a prurient interest. Does that officer have 

any expectation of privacy that his boss won't just 

listen in out of prurient interest? 

MR. RICHLAND: Justice Sotomayor, as to the 

first aspect, the question of reasonable expectation of 

privacy, the motive should have no impact. The motive 

of looking should have no impact. The question of 

reasonable expectation of privacy must be analyzed 

according to the relationship between the officer and 

his -- and his employer. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But if in fact -- and 

whether we agree with this conclusion or not, we accept 

the lower court's views that there was an expectation 

that the chiefs were not going to read these things, 

some expectation of privacy --

MR. RICHLAND: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the limits of it have 

to be limited for all of the reasons you’ve said, doesn't

this case begin and end on whether or not what the jury 

found is reasonable grounds for what the city did? 

MR. RICHLAND: I think that what this case 

begins and ends with, if we assume that there was a 

reasonable expectation of privacy, is under the 

plurality opinion in O'Connor: Whether the search 

itself was reasonable. And the jury did, of course, 

make a determination as to the purpose of the search. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess we don't decide 

our -- our Fourth Amendment privacy cases on the basis 

of whether there -- there was an absolute guarantee of 

privacy from everybody. I think -- I think those cases 

say that if you think it can be made public by anybody, 

you don't -- you don't really have a right of privacy. 

So when the -- when the filthy-minded police 

chief listens in, it's a very bad thing, but it's not --

it’s not offending your right of privacy. You expected 

somebody else could listen in, if not him. 

MR. RICHLAND: I think that's correct, 

Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it is. 

MR. RICHLAND: And I think the reason why 

you must have the two-step analysis in a case of this 

sort -- that is, first look at the question as to 

whether there’s a reasonable expectation of privacy,

and then determine, if there was, whether the search was 

reasonable -- is precisely for the reason that, without 

that, what we will have in every case is the claim that 

there was a salacious reason, that that was the reason. 

And we’ll be litigating every one of those cases --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then, according to what 

you just said, the jury determination was superfluous. 

If there was no reasonable expectation of privacy 

because the officers were told this is just -- we 

treat this just like e-mails, it can be monitored, it 

can be made public, then there would be no reasonable 

expectation of privacy and there would be no question to 

go to the jury. 

MR. RICHLAND: That’s correct, 

Justice Ginsburg. And it is our position that this 

should never have gone to the jury, that summary 

judgment should have been granted in favor of the 

Ontario Police Department. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you have two arguments: 

One, that it's -- there’s no reasonable expectation of 

privacy; even if there were, that this was a reasonable 

search. 

MR. RICHLAND: That’s correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is reasonable expectation 

of privacy a judge question or a jury question?

MR. RICHLAND: Well, if there is a conflict 

in the facts, I presume the jury must resolve those --

that factual conflict. But in this case, I don't 

believe there is a conflict in the facts, and, therefore, 

it is a judge question. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did your client 

treat on-duty text messages different from off-duty text 

messages? 

MR. RICHLAND: It did, once there was an 

initial determination made as to the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did it do that? 

MR. RICHLAND: Excuse me. I'm sorry. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did it treat 

them differently? Under your theory, they’re all the 

same -- no expectation of privacy. 

MR. RICHLAND: It treated them differently 

out of -- because there were two aspects to the case. 

One aspect was the initial determination that Chief 

Sharp ordered to say: I just want to know, is our 

character limit efficacious here, or do we need to have 

a higher character limit? And for that purpose, they 

needed to just look at all of them. And they did; they 

looked at all of the text messages. 

But then when they saw that some of them may 

have involved violations of department regulations, then

it was sent to Internal Affairs, and they redacted the 

off-duty messages because they were --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that something like the 

plain view argument? In search and -- search and --

MR. RICHLAND: I suppose. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm serious. In 

other words, there is, under your view --

MR. RICHLAND: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- legitimate grounds to 

look at the messages, and then once they see it, they 

don't have to ignore it. 

MR. RICHLAND: I think that’s correct, 

Justice Kennedy. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why did -- I'm 

sorry. I still don't understand. It redacted them, 

right? 

MR. RICHLAND: Redacted because the inquiry 

-- the second stage of the inquiry in Internal Affairs --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 

MR. RICHLAND: -- was simply to determine how 

much time was being spent on duty sending personal messages. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

MR. RICHLAND: So the Internal Affairs 

Department said: We don't need to look at the off-duty 

messages. We’re going to redact them. Why get into all

of that? We don't have to look. 

The department was pretty scrupulous. And I 

think that's part of what makes the entire approach that 

they took to this reasonable. It makes the search 

aspect of the case reasonable. And I think it's 

important, in that regard, to look at the nature --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. You said they 

did get to the off-duty text messaging later? 

MR. RICHLAND: No, it was the other way 

around. They looked at the on-duty text messaging at 

the later stage, at the Internal Affairs stage. But 

they looked at all of the text messages when the only 

purpose for the inquiry was to determine how many of the 

text messages in general are job-related and how many 

were personal? Because the question was: Do we need to 

raise the character limit --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you don't have 

to look at the messages to determine that with respect 

to the off-duty messages, right? 

MR. RICHLAND: Well -- well, you did, 

because of the fact, Mr. Chief Justice, that there were 

job-related communications even while there was 

off-duty. These officers were SWAT team officers. They 

were on duty, as Sergeant Quon said, 24/7. That was one 

of the reasons why they had the text messaging pagers.

JUSTICE ALITO: If someone wanted to send a 

message to one of these pagers, what sort of a device 

would you need? Do you need to have another pager, or 

can you -- could you send a message to one of these 

devices from some other type of device? 

MR. RICHLAND: No, there were messages that 

were sent from various other devices. Is the question 

whether that could be physically done, electronically 

done? Because, yes, clearly that was --

JUSTICE ALITO: Yes. What other type of 

device could you use to send a message to one of these 

pagers? 

MR. RICHLAND: It -- oh. I'm not certain 

if it was something other than another text messaging 

pager. It did appear that there were some e-mail 

entries in the transcripts themselves, which suggested 

that there might have been a way to communicate to them 

with e-mail, but that's just -- that's all in the record 

that suggests that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, if they were 

on duty 24/7, there weren't any off-duty messages, were 

there?

they had to respond to emergencies. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If we take it that the 

Stored Communications Act does say that the provider may 

not give out the transcripts, if we take that as given, 

then how can the department lawfully use the 

transcripts? 

MR. RICHLAND: Well, Justice Ginsburg, first 

of all, there was no -- there is no current claim that 

anything that the department did with respect to the 

Stored Communications Act was unlawful. So it may be 

that the other entity, Arch Wireless, violated the 

Stored Communications Act, but that would not preclude 

the department -- which was, after all, the subscriber 

-- from requesting to see what, in fact, the transcripts 

disclosed. 

But in addition to that, there is also the 

fact that, as I said before, a reasonable expectation of 

privacy couldn't be based simply on the fact that there 

was a statute, and particularly not a statute like the 

Stored Communications Act, because that's a statute that’s 

extremely, extremely technical. And there is a --

one has to determine whether an entity was working 

either as an electronic communications service or a 

remote computing service, and so on. Courts are all 

over the board on this. As this Court noted in United

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL, 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 

MR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

Millions of employees today use technologies 

of their -- of their employers under policies 

established by those employers. When a government 

employer has a no-privacy policy in place that governs 

the use of those technologies, ad hoc statements by a 

non-policy member cannot create a reasonable expectation 

of privacy. Put most simply, the computer help desk 

cannot supplant the chief's desk. That simple, clear 

rule should have decided this case. 

Instead, the Ninth Circuit found that the 

1999 policy applied to pagers, but then concluded that 

that 1999 policy was informally modified years later.

this Court's repeated holdings, including 2 years ago in 

the Chief Justice's opinion in Engquist v. Oregon about 

the greater amount of leeway that the government has 

when it acts as an employer. And it also is not 

consistent with the plurality opinion in O'Connor, which 

observed that when the government adopts a policy that 

its employees lack privacy, no reasonable expectation of 

privacy exists. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you this: 

Suppose the department asks for opinion of legal 

counsel whether or not transmittal of the transcripts by 

Arch to the department was a violation of the Act, and 

the counsel said: This was a violation of the Act; they 

had no right to send them to you. Would the department 

then still have had a right to look at the transcripts? 

MR. KATYAL: So the question is if the 

Stored Communications Act is violated? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Yes. 

MR. KATYAL: We don't think the Stored 

Communications Act was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but -- no, my 

hypothetical is that the -- that there is a legal 

counsel's opinion that this was in violation of the Act, 

and let's say the district court said it is in violation 

of the Act. Let's say we say it’s in violation of the

Act. Is that the end of case? The department cannot 

look at the transcripts? 

MR. KATYAL: Oh, absolutely not. I mean, I 

think this Court has repeatedly said that -- that 

various privacy laws don't determine the scope of the 

Fourth Amendment. I think it said so most clearly in 

California v. Greenwood. And I think that's for a very 

simple reason, that things like the Stored 

Communications Act, Justice Kennedy, the Electronic 

Communications Privacy Act, came about --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, California v. 

Greenwood was a question of -- of a Fourth Amendment 

standard that had to be nationwide. So you say it's the 

same -- same thing here? 

MR. KATYAL: I -- I do think it’s the same, 

and for this simple reason, that when you have a 

nationwide standard or a State standard, it’s to fill 

the gap, whatever isn’t necessarily protected by the 

Fourth Amendment. And here --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but Greenwood was in 

the -- in the context of the exclusionary rule in 

criminal proceedings. I certainly think that States --

at least we could make the reasonable argument that 

States can have different policies with respect to their 

employees, that have to be respected.

MR. KATYAL: Absolutely, Justice Kennedy. I 

don't disagree with that. I think the only question is, 

if the -- if I understand your question it’s, does a 

Federal statute about privacy somehow matter to the 

Fourth Amendment analysis about reasonable expectations 

of privacy? And there our contention is, no; it’s 

precisely because Congress enacted the Stored 

Communications Act to fill gaps in Fourth Amendment law. 

That -- that's why it's enacted. 

And for -- for this Court to then use that 

very Act to be the template on which reasonable 

expectations of privacy may spring I think would be a 

very -- it would be a novel proposition. Nor should --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's -- that's a 

little bit puzzling because there are -- electronic 

communications are stored all over the place in -- and 

there isn't a history -- these are -- these are 

relatively new. There isn't a well-established 

understanding about what is private and what isn't 

private. It's a little different from putting garbage 

out in front of your house, which has happened for a 

long time. 

If -- if statutes governing the privacy of 

that information don't have any bearing on reasonable 

expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment, it's

some -- I -- I'm at something of a loss to figure out 

how to determine whether there is a reasonable 

expectation of privacy regarding any of those things. 

MR. KATYAL: Well, Justice Alito, I do think 

that the underlying premise of your question is one with 

which we entirely agree. These are technologies that 

are rapidly in flux, in which we don't have intuitive 

understandings the way we do about, say, trash and so 

on. And it's precisely for that reason I think the 

Court should be very careful to constitutionalize and 

generate Fourth Amendment rules in this area at the 

first instance. 

To do so I think really does freeze into --

into -- into place something that the legislature can't 

then fix, going to Justice Kennedy's opinion in, for 

example, Murray v. Giarratano, in which he said that 

constitutionalizing in that area -- constitutionalizing 

may pretermit legislative solutions. 

Now, here the Stored Communications Act is 

not violated under any way, shape, or form. The Stored 

Communications Act has two different provisions in it, 

one having to do with remote -- remote computing 

services, RCSs. That's when an entity offers storage 

facilities. And the other is for an electronic 

communications service. That is essentially transmission

of messages from point to point. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your point that you 

made just a moment ago, that we don't want to freeze into 

place the constitutional requirements with respect to 

new technology, I wonder if it cuts the other way. We’re 

dealing with an amendment that looks to whether 

something is reasonable. And I think it might be the 

better course to say that the Constitution applies, but 

we’re going to be more flexible in determining what’s 

reasonable because they are dealing with evolving 

technology. 

MR. KATYAL: Well, I think that the -- the 

best way -- I think the most -- the easiest way for the 

Court to resolve this is to simply say that when we are 

dealing with what is reasonable, we look to the policy. 

And here there’s a policy by the employer, it says that 

computer-associated -- computer-related equipment and 

others, there’s no expectation of privacy. You have a 

person who is told that repeatedly. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that puts 

a lot of weight -- I mean, there are some things where we 

don't bind them. You know, you get the usual parking 

garage thing that has got all this small print on the 

back. We -- we don't say that you’re bound by that, 

because nobody reads it.

But in here, I just don't know. I just 

don't know how you tell what’s reasonable -- I suspect 

it might change with how old people are and how 

comfortable they are with the technology -- when you have 

all these different -- different factors. 

You know, they’re told you can use it for 

private; you’ve got to pay for it. I think if I pay for 

it, it's mine, and it’s not the employer's. 

MR. KATYAL: Well, I think the clearest way, 

Mr. Chief Justice, to decide what is reasonable and what 

isn't is actually the terms of the policy. And it seems 

to me very little is more unreasonable than expecting 

a right to privacy after you’ve been told in a 

policy you have no privacy. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose we find a right of 

privacy. Is that the end of the case? I mean, wouldn't 

you also -- in order to sustain this lawsuit, wouldn't 

you also have to find that it was an unreasonable --

MR. KATYAL: Absolutely. There are two 

arrows in the city's quiver, and I think they're right 

as to both of them. But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What’s the government's 

position on the unreasonableness of the search? 

MR. KATYAL: The government's position is 

that the Ninth Circuit just from the get-go got the

standard wrong by citing -- by using a Schowengerdt test 

which was, was this -- was this search the least 

restrictive alternative? And we think this Court has 

repeatedly said that's the wrong way of thinking about 

it, that that puts judges in the position of 

second-guessing searches on the ground, that they’re 

not really fully -- fully equipped to do so. 

So I do think that is a possible way to 

resolve this, Justice Scalia, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe an easier way, huh? 

MR. KATYAL: Well, I don't know that it's 

easier, in the following sense: I think that thousands 

of employers across the country rely on these policies 

and millions of employees. And the Ninth Circuit's 

decision puts that reliance in some jeopardy, because it 

said that you can have an official policy and it can be 

taken back by what some ad hoc subordinate says. And 

that is, I think, a very destructive notion to the idea 

of reliance on these policies and setting --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your -- your 

position would require people basically to have two of 

these things with them, two whatever they are, 

text messager or the BlackBerries or whatever, right? 

Because assuming they’re going to get personal things, 

you know, some emergency at home, they’re also going to

get work things --

MR. KATYAL: To the -- under this policy, 

yes. You might have an employer that sets a different 

policy and allows for some de minimis use and a zone of 

privacy in that use. You can have a variety of 

different things. But what I think would be dangerous 

is to have a blanket rule that constitutionalizes and 

says you always have reasonable expectations of privacy 

in this technology. The result may be, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that employers then won't give that 

technology at all to their employees and -- and 

eliminate even that de minimis use. 

Mr. Chief Justice, you had also asked before 

about the standpoint of Quon in -- in evaluating 

the reasonableness of the search -- of the search in his 

perspective of the policy. We think that is the wrong 

way of looking at it. Instead, we think the proper test 

is the written policy, what it says, and that is the 

simplest way, I think, to provided administrability to 

the lower courts. They can simply say was this policy 

in existence, and not get into those questions of is it 

like a parking ticket, did I flip through it too 

quickly, did I understand that the policy and the like.

of the workplace and say the minute you issued a written 

policy that renders all searches okay, even if the 

operational realities are different? 

MR. KATYAL: Not at all, Justice Sotomayor. 

I take it the language about operational realities in 

the workplace, what is right next to it is looking to 

whether or not there are regulations in place, and here 

a policy is a regulation. And so --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You may have an argument 

that the nature of the policy here and all of the 

activities related to it don't prove an operational 

reality of privacy, but I don't know why -- you want a 

flat rule that says once you have a written policy, 

there’ no expectation of privacy. 

MR. KATYAL: And I think that is -- that is 

what O'Connor says with respect to the -- as long as the 

policy is in place, that -- that's what O'Connor 

permits.

skipping over is -- is -- and both the lower courts 

recognize this -- that the computer policy that the 

department had didn't apply to the pagers on its own. 

It -- it only came into play after Lieutenant Duke 

modified that policy and told people at the -- at the 

meeting that was referred to earlier that the pagers are 

now going to be applying with -- with this policy. 

It -- it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is -- why is that so? 

I mean, it did say associated equipment. And -- and if 

an employee is told now e-mails aren't private, so we’re 

warning you, we can monitor them, wouldn't such an 

employee expect the same thing to apply to the pager? 

MR. DAMMEIER: Well, the policy itself has 

two components to it. One is, don't use our equipment, 

all associated equipment for personal business. 

The other part of that policy deals with the 

no privacy, and it informs the people there could be 

monitoring. And specifically on the acknowledgment form 

of that policy, which is at Appendix 156 of the 

petition, it specifically says the city will 

periodically monitor e-mail, Internet use, and computer 

usage. 

And -- and, again, I think this is why the --

both lower courts came to the conclusion that the

computer policy on its own wasn't in play until 

Lieutenant Duke announced that, hey, now the pagers are 

going -- are going to be in play with this computer 

policy. This is the same Lieutenant Duke --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But my question is, an 

employee reads this policy and says, oh, my e-mails are 

going to be subject to being monitored --

MR. DAMMEIER: Sure. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't that employee 

expect that the policy would carry over to pagers? I mean, 

would -- when you think of what's the reason why they want 

to look at the e-mails, wouldn't the same reason apply? 

MR. DAMMEIER: Well, I'm sure the same 

reasons could apply, but the -- the city is the one that 

writes the rules here. The -- if they want to make it 

clear on what it applies to, it certainly should be on 

them to write them clear so the employee understands. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe -- maybe 

everybody else knows this, but what is the difference 

between a pager and e-mail? 

MR. DAMMEIER: Sure. The e-mail, looking at 

the computer policy -- that goes through the city's 

computer, it goes through the city's server, it goes 

through all the equipment that -- that has -- that the 

city can easily monitor. Here the pagers are a separate

device that goes home with you, that travels with you, 

that you can use on duty, off duty, and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can do that with 

e-mails. 

MR. DAMMEIER: Certainly, certainly. But in 

this -- in this -- in this instance with the pagers, it went 

through no city equipment; it went through Arch Wireless 

and then was transmitted to another -- another person. 

So, again, to Duke -- Duke is the one that 

said: Hey, this -- this comes into play. But 

Lieutenant Duke is also the one that gave the privacy 

guarantee to the SWAT team members and said: As long as 

you pay the overages, we’re not going to look at your 

pagers; we're not going to look at the messages. So if 

-- if you couple both of those modifications, both by 

the same lieutenant -- and he wasn't just some 

subordinate; he was the lieutenant in charge of the 

administrative bureau; he was the administrative bureau 

commander. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that he said --

he was saying: But as far as billing is concerned, I'm 

not going to look at these; if you use more than 25,000 

characters, you pay the extra, and that will be the end 

of it. If you contest that, then I’ll look to see 

whether those in excess of 25,000 characters were for

work purposes or private purposes. 

And so he's talking about the billing. He 

hasn't retracted what was said at the meeting about -- that 

these text messages are subject to audit. 

MR. DAMMEIER: This -- this is what Sergeant 

Quon testified to, that he attributed to Lieutenant 

Duke: If you don't want us to read it, pay the overage 

fee. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But what’s wrong with his 

deciding: I don't like to do this anymore? I don't 

want to collect all this money; it's too complicated; 

and so I don't know how many of these messages are 

related to work and how many they are just mucking 

around prying into each other's business. 

MR. DAMMEIER: He can certainly --

JUSTICE BREYER: So I would like to know, so 

therefore I'm going to look and see. Now, what’s 

unreasonable about that? 

MR. DAMMEIER: Well, he certainly could say 

I don't want to do this anymore, and he could --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no. 

MR. DAMMEIER: And he could tell everybody. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm saying what's 

-- the city owns the pager. It's a pager used for work.

use it off work. It seems to be involving a big amount 

of collection, and so what he wants to do is he wants to 

see how much of this is being used for work and how much 

is of this not being used for work. 

My question, which I just repeated, is why 

is that an unreasonable thing? 

MR. DAMMEIER: I don't think that request is 

unreasonable, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. And then if that’s 

not unreasonable, why is what went on here that is 

any different? 

MR. DAMMEIER: Well, here the jury -- the 

only fact that was determined by the jury was the reason 

for the search. And that's found at the appendix to the 

petition page 119. This is the only finding that the 

jury made as to the purpose of the search: To determine 

the efficacy of the existing character limits to ensure 

that officers were not being required to pay for the 

work-related expenses. 

JUSTICE BREYER: How does that differ from 

what I just said? 

MR. DAMMEIER: Well, it -- it comes into 

play on -- on the scope of the search. Again --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I understand. I thought 

it's just a more -- a few more words to say just what I

said. That they wanted to look into this because they 

are tired about collecting so much money. 

It's the third time I've said the same 

thing; probably it's my fault I’m not being clear. But 

it looked as if they wanted to know how many are being 

sent for work purposes, how many for private purposes 

including prying into people's business, which wasn't 

too desirable, and -- and -- so that they could get 

the -- the charges right. 

Now, that sounds like what the jury said they 

were doing, too. And my question was -- I don't see 

anything, quite honestly, unreasonable about that, where 

you’re the employer, where it's a SWAT team, where --

where -- where you’re paying for this in the first 

place. So the reason I ask it is I would like you 

clearly to explain what's unreasonable about it. 

MR. DAMMEIER: The scope of the search was 

unreasonable. 

JUSTICE BREYER: That's the conclusion. Now, 

what's your reason? 

MR. DAMMEIER: Under -- under -- looking at 

O'Connor, you have to -- you have to look to make sure 

that the search is not excessively intrusive. Here, 

what they did was they took all the messages and started 

reading them. Given the purpose, the limited purpose

that was found by the jury for the search, they didn't 

need to do that. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, explain that one to 

me. 

MR. DAMMEIER: They --

JUSTICE BREYER: Being naive about this, if 

I had a -- like, 20, 30,000 characters in 1,800 messages 

and I wanted to know which are personal and which are 

work-related, a good way to get at least a good first 

cut would be to read them. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay? So I start off 

thinking that seems to be reasonable to me. That's what 

I would do. 

MR. DAMMEIER: Well, that's certainly one --

JUSTICE BREYER: So all right. Now you tell 

me why that isn't reasonable. 

MR. DAMMEIER: That's one of the ways they 

could have done it. They could have got -- they could 

have got consent from the officers first to do it. They 

could have had the officers themselves count the 

messages. After all, the officers were the ones that 

were paying for the overages. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But the 

officers might say: I don't want you to read these

messages because they happen to be about the sexual 

activity of some of my coworkers and their wives and me, 

which happened to be the case here. 

MR. DAMMEIER: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So I guess if you had asked 

for consent, the officer would have said no.

know. I will be repeating it. All right. So what -- that 

didn't sound very practical. What's the other way?

could have had the officers themselves count the

to say, hey, these are all big -- work-related. I’ll

JUSTICE BREYER: Look, so far I listened to four 

things, and I'm just being naive about it. I’ll read it 

more closely, but I don't see why these four things are 

so obviously more reasonable than what they did. 

MR. DAMMEIER: They also -- they could have 

had the officers redact the private messages and then 

given it -- given it to the department. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But suppose that their 

application of what -- how much was being spent on 

business-related, all of your suggestions about having 

the officer do things does nothing about their application. 

MR. DAMMEIER: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You’re -- you’re 

relying on the very person you’re auditing to do the 

audit for you. That doesn't seem either practical or 

business-wise. 

MR. DAMMEIER: Well, other than my one 

sample of -- example of saying, hey, let's -- let's stop 

the personal use and we’re going to have a test month 

to determine exactly how many messages we need for our 

business-related purposes.

don't understand that. You’re still relying on the 

person you’re auditing to say to you I’m only using 

it for business. That -- that's just not logical. 

MR. DAMMEIER: Well, but the -- the sole 

purpose of the search was only to find out if officers 

were paying for business-related messages that they 

didn't need to pay for. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But the question, in the 

Constitution, the word is "unreasonable." Is it a 

reasonable or unreasonable? So the question -- what I 

asked is not maybe you would have gotten a better result 

if you had hired Bain Associates and Bain would have 

done a 4-month study at a cost of $50,000. 

But I could say a person who doesn't want 

to hire Bain and who doesn't want to rely on the 

unverified word of the officers who were using these for 

God knows what is not being unreasonable. That's the 

ultimate issue. And that's why I’m putting it to you 

to show me that what they did was unreasonable. 

MR. DAMMEIER: I think it comes down from 

that perspective on the excessiveness of the search. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The only reason --

the only reason the officer would not be accurate -- I 

mean, I don't understand why the redaction is such a bad 

idea. He just says these are private. And that allows

-- and then you could look at everything else. You can 

see if he's going too far because then everything else 

would be there. But in terms of -- the jury found this 

was not done to find out what was in the messages, so 

they don't need to find out what’s in the messages. 

That's just a question. He has to pay for everything he 

-- he redacts. 

MR. DAMMEIER: That -- that's exactly what 

we’re saying. I mean, the interest here is -- is for 

the officer to be upfront as far as what’s 

business-related to -- if he's paying for things that he 

shouldn't be paying for, I'm sure he would -- he would be 

forthright about that. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, it's no 

different than the police coming in and saying, well, 

we’re going to look at, you know, what's in every drawer 

and then -- you know, then if it turns out to be 

personal and private, we won't -- you know, we won't --

it just happens that we came upon, I guess, is 

Justice Kennedy's point. It's kind of the plain view 

doctrine, except they get to decide how broad what they 

can view is. 

MR. DAMMEIER: That's true. I agree with 

that.

about the basic background of a reasonable expectation 

of privacy? This is SWAT team work. Supposing it was an 

officer answering 911 calls or things like that. Isn't 

there sort of a background expectation that sooner or 

later, somebody might have to look at communications for 

this particular kind of law enforcement officer? 

MR. DAMMEIER: Well, certainly -- certainly 

that could happen in any number of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I mean, wouldn't you just 

assume that that whole universe of conversations by SWAT 

officers who are on duty 24/7 might well have to be 

reviewed by some member of the public or some of their 

superiors? 

MR. DAMMEIER: But that -- that could be a 

possibility on any -- on anything that they do in their 

lives, whether it be their personal life or --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but it's over 

official -- it's over the official communications 

equipment that they use for purposes of law enforcement. 

MR. DAMMEIER: Correct. Correct. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I certainly -- criminal 

defense attorneys challenging probable cause would want 

to look at these. They would want to see if there is 

exonerating evidence, under the rule that all 

exonerating evidence has to be submitted. It would seem

to me that it's quite likely, as Justice Stevens' 

question indicates, that there is going to -- that these 

are going to be discoverable. 

MR. DAMMEIER: Well, it's just like my mail 

that I might send out to somebody. It might be 

discoverable in litigation, but that doesn't --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you’re not -- you’re 

not a police officer who is making arrests. I mean, 

this -- this is part and parcel of determining probable 

cause and mitigating evidence. 

MR. DAMMEIER: No, it -- obviously, there 

are different reasons that could come into play that 

would legally produce these messages, certainly. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dammeier, you could say 

the same thing about private phones. There are 

obviously circumstances in which whether you were making 

a call between certain times becomes relevant to 

litigation. So you could say that destroys the 

expectation of privacy? I'm not sure. I hope we don't 

say that. 

MR. DAMMEIER: No. No. It's like -- this 

-- in O'Connor, all nine Justices in O'Connor found an 

expectation of privacy in Dr. Ortega's desk, because 

even though it was a state-owned desk, you still have an 

expectation of privacy.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but there’s no 

normal reason for going through somebody's desk; whereas, 

there would be a very ordinary -- ordinary reason for 

reviewing calls made to the SWAT -- members of the SWAT 

team, it seems to me. 

MR. DAMMEIER: Well, there are -- as talked 

about in O'Connor, there are certainly a lot of valid 

reasons to go through a public employee's desk, if you’re 

looking for a file or if you’re looking for --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. 

MR. DAMMEIER: Or for -- or for an 

investigation. But still, there was that expectation of 

privacy. You’re talking about employees that -- in 

today's society, I think work and private life get 

melded together. Here, we’re talking about SWAT people 

24/7 --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, to say that there’s 

an expectation of privacy in the desk doesn't say that 

every intrusion into that expectation of privacy is an 

unreasonable one. There could be that expectation of 

privacy and, still, for some reason -- let's assume there 

has been a theft in the building, and it's known that 

what was taken has not gotten out of the building. It's 

conceivable that that would be a valid reason to intrude 

upon the expectation of privacy, right?

taking away the government's ability to do searches 

under proper circumstances. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why isn't this a 

proper circumstance? 

MR. DAMMEIER: The initial circumstance 

might be proper, but how they effectuated it was not. 

It was excessively intrusive. They did not -- the 

purpose was to find out if they were paying for enough 

work-related messages. They did not need to look at 

these, what they knew were going to be private messages. 

They knew -- the lieutenant had this arrangement that they 

could use this for personal purposes. They knew what 

they were going to be looking at. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't know which ones 

were private messages, did they? 

MR. DAMMEIER: Not until they read them. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not until they read them. 

MR. DAMMEIER: But there certainly -- they 

certainly knew what might be coming because of the 

arrangement that Lieutenant Duke had in place. 

Here -- here I think that’s --

JUSTICE ALITO: What was the arrangement 

that Lieutenant Duke had in place? I thought all he 

said was: I don't have an intent to read these,

because it's too much trouble, so if you go over and you 

pay me the extra, I'm not going to read them. 

MR. DAMMEIER: His --

JUSTICE ALITO: Did he ever say that -- that 

I'm not -- that you have a privacy right in these 

things? 

MR. DAMMEIER: No, but according -- according 

to Sergeant Quon's testimony, he told him: As long as you 

pay the overages, we’re not going to read them. And that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did he say "we"? He -- even 

Quon didn't say that. Duke said he wouldn't do it. But 

earlier, the -- at the meeting, the statement was made 

that these are open to audit. Didn't say only by 

Lieutenant Duke. 

MR. DAMMEIER: True. True. I agree. But 

it was Lieutenant Duke, the one that was making the 

announcement that now these pagers are going to fall 

under the computer policy, the same lieutenant who then 

gave the assurance that as long as you pay the overages, 

we’re not -- we’re not going to look at them. 

I mean, when you’re talking about the 

operational reality of O'Connor, that was the 

operational reality. The SWAT members knew: As long as 

I pay the overages, my messages aren't going to be 

reviewed.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What happens, just 

out of curiosity, if you're -- he is on the pager and 

sending a message and they’re trying to reach him for, 

you know, a SWAT team crisis? Does he -- does the one 

kind of trump the other, or do they get a busy signal? 

MR. DAMMEIER: I don't think that's in the 

record. However, my understanding is that you would get 

it in between messages. So messages are going out and 

coming in at the same time, pretty much. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And would you know 

where the message was coming from? 

MR. DAMMEIER: I believe so. It identifies 

where it's coming from. It identifies the number of 

where it's coming from. If you know the number, you 

know where it's coming from.

call is very important to us; we’ll get back to you?

transferred from device to device, and here, you know,

expectation of privacy -- you know, it's -- lawfully, 

those messages were protected. And I think, looking at 

people's expectation of privacy, that should be a 

component. It certainly may be not the end-all to the 

question, but it should be a factor in determining 

whether or not there’s going to be an expectation of 

privacy. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did -- did he know about 

that statute? I didn't know about it. 

MR. DAMMEIER: That's not in -- that's not 

in the record. That is not in the record. But --

that, but we also --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And what difference would that 

make? 

MR. DAMMEIER: I still don't think anything, 

given the operational realities --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don’t see how it can affect 

his expectation of privacy, if he didn't even know about it. 

MR. DAMMEIER: Well, it's -- it's just like 

the California Public Records Act. We should also 

assume he didn't know about that as well, because the --

Petitioners make an argument that because there is this

one's expectation of privacy. Certainly, if we’re 

going to have that, then we should also be having the 

Stored Communications Act that might enhance the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Ignorance of the law is no 

excuse, is what you’re saying? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any theory, 

or do you make any argument that Florio, Trujillo, and 

Quon's wife can succeed in their Fourth Amendment 

claims, if Quon can't? 

MR. DAMMEIER: I do. We, in our brief, try 

to analogize that to the mail. I think when they sent 

messages to -- to Sergeant Quon, that was a letter that 

I sent. And here, the department didn't go get that 

letter from Sergeant Quon after -- after delivery, 

meaning go get it from his pager. They went to the 

equivalent of the Post Office, which was Arch Wireless, 

and got a copy off of their server. So I -- I think --

and, again, analogizing to the mail, they have an 

expectation of privacy while that message is in the 

course of delivery. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose it was 

perfectly clear that -- I mean, suppose that the department 

gave Mr. Quon a policy -- a statement that says: Sign 

this, you acknowledge that your pager is to be used only

for work and that you have no privacy interest in it 

whatsoever; we’re going to monitor this every day. 

And then these other individuals sent him messages. 

You would still say they have an expectation 

of privacy in those messages? 

MR. DAMMEIER: Until the point that it’s on 

Quon's pager. I think under that scenario, that they 

could have obtained the messages from Quon, but they 

went over to Arch, the equivalent of the Post Office, 

and got them from them. 

It's like if I -- I make a copy of a letter 

before I send it to somebody. You know, down the road, 

I might not know what happens and I might lose my 

expectation of privacy down the road, but that copy I 

kept, I think there is still an expectation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what -- when you send 

a text message to somebody else, aren't you quite aware 

that that text message will remain confidential only to 

the extent that either the recipient keeps it 

confidential -- and he can disclose it -- or somebody 

else who has power over the recipient or over the 

recipient's phone chooses to look at it? Don't -- isn't 

that understood when you send somebody a text message?

understood that, you know, whoever could get ahold of 

his phone lawfully can read the message. In other 

words, I don't see that she's in a -- in a different 

position from Quon himself. 

MR. DAMMEIER: I think it's just a slightly 

different one. I mean, first of all, they didn't 

lawfully get it; there was a violation of the Stored 

Communications Act to get it. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's a different 

issue. 

MR. DAMMEIER: But here, again, had they 

gotten consent from -- from Quon and got it from him 

directly, that's a -- that's a different story. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, again, it depends 

upon their reasonable expectation. Do any of these 

other people know about Arch Wireless? Don't they just 

assume that once they send something to Quon, it's going 

to Quon? 

MR. DAMMEIER: That's -- that is true. I 

mean, they expect --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then they 

can't have a reasonable expectation of privacy based on 

the fact that their communication is routed through a 

communications company.

that some company, I'm sure, is going to have to be

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I didn't -- I 

wouldn't think that. I thought, you know, you push a 

button; it goes right to the other thing.

MR. DAMMEIER: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean it doesn't go 

right to the other thing?

MR. DAMMEIER: It's -- I mean, it's like 

with e-mails. When we send an e-mail, that goes through 

some e-mail provider, whether it be AOL or Yahoo. It's 

going through some service provider. Just like when 

we send a letter or package, it's going through -- some 

provider is going to move that for us, until it gets to 

the end recipient. And like the mail, that message enjoys 

an expectation of privacy while it's with the Post 

Office --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you print these things 

out? Could Quon print these -- these spicy 

conversations out and circulate them among his buddies?

MR. DAMMEIER: And -- and like, when I get a 

piece of mail from somebody, I could do that as well, 

but that doesn't mean that the government gets to go to 

the Post Office and get my mail before I get it. I 

think -- I think that, you know, certainly adds a little 

bit to the correspondence that dealt with --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But just -- just to 

be clear: You think if these messages went straight to 

Quon that there’d be no problem from the point of 

view of the senders? I mean, no problem in searching --

getting them from Quon? 

MR. DAMMEIER: I think it's certainly a 

harder argument for me to make --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 

MR. DAMMEIER: -- that they have an 

expectation after -- after Quon has it.

for your argument to succeed that they know that this goes 

somewhere else and then it’s processed and then it goes 

to Quon.

reasonable assumption to make. One --

Florio testified that she actually called her carrier to 

find out, you know, if -- if the messages that she would 

transmit would be maintained and that was -- that they 

didn't maintain a copy. So there was some understanding 

of how the process worked. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Can an officer who has one 

of these pagers delete messages from the pager --

MR. DAMMEIER: Yes. 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- so that they can't be 

recovered by the department if the pager is turned into

MR. DAMMEIER: Sure. Yes. 

JUSTICE ALITO: They can delete them? 

MR. DAMMEIER: They can delete them. Just 

like if they received a letter, they could be put in the 

shredder. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose I sent somebody a 

letter and -- and I have privacy in that letter, and 

let's assume it’s intercepted at the Post Office, but I 

have also published the letter in a letter to the editor 

of the newspaper. I have written the following letter 

to Sergeant Quon. Do I still have a right -- a right of 

privacy in that letter?

your expectation may be diminished.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that's the 

situation here. The -- the central location that stores 

the message is one thing, but she's made -- made the 

message public effectively by sending it to Quon. Once 

it gets to Quon, she knows that Quon can make it public 

or that the employer can -- can find out about it. 

MR. DAMMEIER: But that would create a 

free-for-all in service providers. If -- if while this 

message, after it’s sent and it’s in transit --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. DAMMEIER: It's a free-for-all. The 

government could just go in and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. That -- and 

that's why you have the statute, because the Fourth 

Amendment wouldn't solve the problem, because you are 

effectively making it public by sending it to somebody 

whom you don't know is immune from disclosure. So, in 

order to stop the intermediary from making it public, 

you needed the statute. Otherwise you wouldn't need it; 

the Fourth Amendment would solve the problem, right? 

MR. DAMMEIER: Well, certainly, obviously 

the statute could come into play in addition to the 

Fourth Amendment. But here, you know, I come back to 

the mail analogy. Just because at the end of the line 

somebody might disseminate my letter doesn't lose an

expectation in the copy that I make that I may keep or 

that in the course of delivery the Post Office might 

keep. I still enjoy an expectation -- and the Fourth 

Amendment certainly protects that copy, that either I 

kept or the Post Office is keeping in the course of 

delivery. 

Certainly, at the end of the line, that letter 

could be published to the world, but that's not the same 

thing as the government coming in and getting a copy of 

it while it was being delivered. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Are you sure that -- are you 

sure about your answer to the question of deletion? 

It's not like deleting something from a computer which 

doesn't really delete it from the computer? 

MR. DAMMEIER: Honestly, I'm not -- that's 

not in the record, and the -- how that pager works as 

far as deleting, I couldn't be certain that it would be 

deleted forever. I would certainly not. 

One -- one of the points to -- to raise, 

too, was that most of these texts took place off duty 

when dealing with Sergeant Quon. So, again, back to 

looking at the actual practice that O'Connor has us look 

at, you know, here again --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought the factual 

record was the opposite, that in fact most of the calls

were -- not most, but a huge number of calls were 

happening on duty. 

MR. DAMMEIER: There were -- there were a 

large number on-duty. I think it was broken down to 

where the average was 27 in a work shift and the most on 

one day was 80. But also they talked about -- they took 

about 15 seconds. So you’re talking about an average 

of about 7 minutes during -- during a work day. 

But the testimony of Sergeant Quon was that 

most of these were actually off-duty. And, you know, I 

certainly -- I think that should come into play, given 

the department -- they gave them pagers. And it wasn't 

a one-way use; it wasn't, hey, this is, you know, for the 

benefit of the employee. The department received a benefit. 

I mean, they wanted to be able to have these SWAT guys 

show up quickly, respond quickly, and there was a mix on 

-- on the reasons for these pagers. 

The exchange was, we’re going to let you 

use these for personal purposes, and given that reality, 

you should be able to have some -- some expectation of 

privacy in that use. It's like if I pick up a phone and 

I'm a public employee and I call my wife, I should be 

able to have some expectation of privacy in a 

conversation, especially given, you know -- you talk 

about guys that are on 24/7. Do they have no private

life, now? Do they not have --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the policy was 

limited personal use. 

MR. DAMMEIER: The computer policy was 

limited personal use. Again, depending on how that 

comes into play with what Lieutenant Duke --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the notice was 

we’re going to treat these just like e-mails, and 

e-mails were limited personal use. 

MR. DAMMEIER: Correct. With -- with the 

additional modification by -- by Duke, that you could 

also use them for personal purposes, from day one when 

the pagers were issued. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

MR. DAMMEIER: Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHARDS 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. RICHLAND: Thank you. I would first 

like to just make it clear that what it is being claimed 

was the guarantee of privacy by Lieutenant Duke is 

really absolutely not that at all. And I would refer 

the Court to Joint Appendix page 40, which does summarize 

that, and it says -- here is what precisely what

Lieutenant Duke said: "Because of the overage 

Lieutenant Duke went to Sergeant Quon and told him the 

city-issued two-way pagers were considered e-mail and 

could be audited." So that's what he said first. 

Then he said -- he told Sergeant Quon it was 

not his -- his intent to audit employees' text messages 

to see if the overages were due to work-related 

transmissions. 

He advised Sergeant Quon he, Sergeant Quon, 

could reimburse the city for the overages so he, Duke, 

would not have to audit the transmission and see how 

many messages were non-work-related. Lieutenant Duke 

told Sergeant Quon he is doing this because if anybody 

wished to challenge their overage, he could audit the 

text transmissions to verify how many were 

non-work-related, and then, finally, Lieutenant Duke 

added, the text messages were considered public records 

and could be audited at any time. 

That is what is being characterized as a 

guarantee of privacy. It's hard to see how that in any 

way undercuts the official written policy. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Richland, do you take 

any position on whether Jerilyn Quon, April Florio, and 

Steve Trujillo stand in the same position as Sergeant 

Quon insofar as this lawsuit is concerned?

MR. RICHLAND: We do, with respect -- in at 

least one respect, and that is: If Sergeant Quon loses, 

then we think the other plaintiffs must also lose. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? 

MR. RICHLAND: Yes. The reason for that is 

that this Court has held on many occasions that, once 

one has sent a communication or an object to another 

person, they lose their expectation of privacy in --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That means the 

government can set up an interception mechanism on 

telephone transmissions, on e-mail, computer 

transmissions --

MR. RICHLAND: It -- it does not mean that, 

Justice Sotomayor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If it doesn't mean that, 

answer his argument that, yes, you could take anything 

from Quon, but the storage -- you went to the storage 

facility, which is a Post Office. 

MR. RICHLAND: And he says it's a Post 

Office, but the truth is that all of these plaintiffs 

admitted that they knew that this was a 

department-issued pager, and this wasn't a Post Office. 

Arch Wireless was the department's agent. 

These text messages were being sent to 

someplace. Both the written policy and the oral policy

indicated that they were being stored ---

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you have to get 

into who owned --

MR. RICHLAND: Excuse me. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Whether this was a -- we 

have to get into the Storage Act and figure out whether 

this was an RCN or ACS? 

MR. RICHLAND: Well, I think that -- I 

don't know that it's necessary to do that, because I 

think that all that must be determined is -- and I don't 

think whether it's an ECS or RCS is -- you would require 

that to determine who owned it, because it was clear 

that Arch acted solely as the city's agent. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Whoa, whoa. I'm not sure 

you’re doing the city a favor by making Arch the city's 

agent --

MR. RICHLAND: I understand --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- as opposed to an 

independent contractor who is doing business with the 

city. 

MR. RICHLAND: The point is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You sure you want to live 

with that? 

MR. RICHLAND: I don't mean "agent" in -- in 

the most literal sense, Justice Scalia.

were -- in effect, when there was a delivery to Arch 

Wireless, it was a delivery to the city. And all of 

these individuals knew that this was city equipment, and, 

therefore, this was being delivered to the city.
