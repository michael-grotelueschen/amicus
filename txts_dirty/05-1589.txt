 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. MCKENNA

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. MCKENNA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Washington law authorizes union security 

agreements which permit unions to enter into collective 

bargaining agreements that require non-member employees 

to pay an agency shop fee or lose their job. The 

union's authority to select these compelled fees is 

based solely on statute and the subject of statutory 

conditions. Section 760, as adopted by Washington 

voters in 1992, requires unions to obtain the 

affirmative consent from non-members before their fees 

may be used to influence an election or operate a 

political committee. 760 serves the state's interest in 

election integrity by means of ensuring that union 

election activity is funded by voluntary contributions, 

just like every other organization that seeks political

funds. 760 is a valid condition on the union statutory 

authority and does not violate the union's First 

Amendment rights.

 760 serves the state's interests specified 

in the adopted initiative, which were -- which are found 

at petition appendix 138a codified as RCW 4217.620. 

Three interests in election integrity are stated, or 

three means of serving an interest in election integrity 

are stated in this portion, the intent portion of the 

statute.

 First, to ensure that individuals have a 

fair and equal opportunity to influence elections; 

second, to reduce the influence of large organizational 

contributors; third, to restore public trust in the 

election process. The Washington Supreme Court, 

petition appendix 22a-23a, agreed that the intent of 

Initiative 134 was to protect the integrity of the 

election process from the perception that individuals 

have an insignificant role to play.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm surprised that that's 

the -- I would have thought its primary purpose would be 

to spare individuals the necessity of supporting causes 

that they don't support. Was there no First Amendment 

interest.

 MR. MCKENNA: Justice Scalia, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it only an election law 

interest?

 MR. MCKENNA: Actually, Justice Scalia, we 

believe that Section, Section 760 accomplishes both 

purposes. The overall intent of the initiative was as I 

stated found by the State Supreme Court, but clearly 

from the plain language of Section 760 --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you just said the State 

Supreme Court was wrong. I mean, why do you believe it 

on this if you don't believe it on everything else? 

You're appealing from it, aren't you?

 MR. MCKENNA: We believe that the integrity 

of the election process, Justice Scalia, is in fact 

served by helping ensure that individuals make voluntary 

contributions. We think that in fact it does help the 

integrity of the election process, yes, sir.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how can the State 

Supreme Court determine what is the purpose, the intent, 

of the ballot initiative?

 MR. MCKENNA: I'm not certain, Your Honor. 

They referred to the --

JUSTICE ALITO: A lot of people voted for 

it.

 MR. MCKENNA: Right.

Court in a position to determine why they voted for it?

 MR. MCKENNA: They simply hold, Your Honor, 

in their opinion that this is what the voters intended.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How do they know that?

 MR. MCKENNA: I don't know how they know it, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If that's what they 

intended, then how can a State say, well, it's the 

union's money, we don't want you to send this little bit 

of your money to contribute in a campaign, but if the 

local swimming team wants to, or the bar association or 

the corporation, if they want to spend money that people 

have given them for totally other purposes, the 

compulsory bar association, well, they can do that. 

It's just the labor unions that can't spend the money 

that these people forced to belong -- you know, they 

have to object affirmatively -- but all the other 

similar organizations, they can't.

 MR. MCKENNA: Your Honor, beginning with the 

Railway Labor Act case and continuing up through the 

public school teacher cases, Abood and Hudson, this 

Court has recognized that compelling employees to pay 

fees must be balanced against the need to protect them 

from --

about this other purpose, but that other purpose, which 

is rather interesting -- I take it that's one of the 

main points on the other side -- the other purpose has 

nothing to do with this case. If Washington wanted to 

have a similar statute where it was worried about 

protecting the interests of the compelled member or the 

compelled payor, fine, fine, that would be a different 

case. That isn't this case.

 MR. MCKENNA: Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: In this case they couldn't 

care less about that.

 MR. MCKENNA: Actually, Your Honor, I think 

the plain language of 760 makes it clear that the 

authors of the initiative intended to protect individual 

interests. There is no meaningful distinction between 

the use of individuals in 760, in Section 760, than 

there is in the Hudson, in the Hudson statute, for 

example. The Hudson statute, the Illinois statute at 

issue in Hudson, also required nonmembers to opt in in 

order to make, not just political contributions but any 

contributions. But the Court, this Court, found no 

problem with Hudson or with the Illinois statute in that 

case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's true, but in that 

case, in that case they didn't have a State Supreme

Court interpreting the statute which is just as you 

started off saying it was, which has nothing to with the 

rights of the nonmember, zero. It has to do with the 

appearance of fairness in the election.

 MR. MCKENNA: Your Honor, with due respect 

that was the legal conclusion of the Washington Supreme 

Court. It was not a construction of the statute. It 

was a legal conclusion based on their reading or 

divining of voter intend. But this Court is not bound 

by such an assessment.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I wanted to ask 

about that. Suppose Washington says that as a matter of 

Washington law we are bound by our interpretation of 

purpose and we interpret the statute according to that 

purpose. You use the words "plain language" a few 

minutes ago.

 MR. MCKENNA: Yes. Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are we free to disregard 

that and to say. Oh well, we're just going to follow 

the plain language?

 MR. MCKENNA: No, no.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Like the says that was 

argued, the first case this morning?

morning, first look to the plain language, as the 

Solicitor General has pointed out in numerous briefs --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's a Federal, a 

Federal statute and this is a State statute. If the 

State court says, we're interested in purposes, we 

decided, and you must as a matter of State law interpret 

the statute according to the purpose as we found it, 

aren't we bound by that?

 MR. MCKENNA: I don't believe you are bound 

by that, Your Honor. For example --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your authority for 

that?

 MR. MCKENNA: Wisconsin v. Mitchell, Your 

Honor. In that case the Wisconsin Supreme Court was 

found by this Court not to have constructed the statute, 

but to have made an assessment of its practical effects, 

and this Court found it was not bound. Similarly in 

Teller, a case more directly relevant to this case, the 

State Supreme Court found that the Bar Association of 

California is a governmental agency and this Court 

declined to follow the State Supreme Court of California 

and found that in fact it was not.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's because the 

characterization had a Federal consequence.

 MR. MCKENNA: Your Honor, I simply observed

that this Court did not find it was bound by the 

California Supreme Court's finding that the bar 

association is a government agency, nor did it find in 

Wisconsin v. Mitchell that it was bound by the Wisconsin 

Supreme Court in regards to its assessment of practical 

effects of the Wisconsin statute at issue there.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Do they get their money 

back? If this is upheld and I'm an agency member, I 

hate the union, can't stand it, gave them the $20 for 

this and they spent it on a political candidate I hate 

even more and you win, do I get my $20 back or can the 

union just spend my $20 on something else?

 MR. MCKENNA: Your Honor, if it is a 760 

expense they should get the money back. If it is a 

non-760 expense which is not germane, then they would 

have to opt out at that -- they would have to opt out to 

get that kind of money back, unless Your Honor is 

referring to what happens on, if the statute is upheld, 

what happens when we go back and have a further trial on 

the issues in this case. I'm not sure which scenario 

you were envisioning, but --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to get at the 

question is this the union's money or is this the 

workers', the teachers' money?

JUSTICE BREYER: So does he get this money 

back if they violate the statute.

 MR. MCKENNA: Your Honor, the 760 money --

excuse me. The 760 money is not the union's money until 

they have satisfied the conditions laid out in the 

statute, in this case Section 760. Possession of the 

fees does not entitle the WEA or any union to use those 

fees to influence an election or operate a political 

committee until after they have satisfied the condition 

on that collection, the condition being in this case 

they have to obtain affirmative authorization. This 

Court held in Phillipson and Brown that, analogizing to 

that money, that non-members own the fees until the 

statutory conditions are satisfied.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let, let's assume that it 

makes a difference whether the purpose of the statute 

was at least in part to protect the First Amendment 

rights of the non-union members or whether, as the 

Washington Supreme Court seemed to say -- at least they 

said its principal purpose was to protect the voting 

process. Elsewhere in its opinion, however, the 

Washington Supreme Court says where a statute is 

ambiguous and this court is able to construe it in a 

manner which renders it constitutional the court is 

obliged to do so, which sounds to me like good law.

Wouldn't that apply to its intuition as to what the 

intent of the people who enacted this statute were?

 MR. MCKENNA: Yes, sir --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wouldn't the Washington 

Supreme Court be obliged to intuit that purpose which 

would make it constitutional rather than 

unconstitutional?

 MR. MCKENNA: Yes, Your Honor, it would if 

in fact Section 760 were ambiguous. It is, however, not 

ambiguous. It is plain on its face, and in fact the 

Supreme Court did not state that any term or phrase in 

Section 760 is ambiguous. Instead they referred to 

their divination of voter intent. And I believe, Your 

Honor --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree with the 

court's conclusion that constitutionality is at issue 

here?

 MR. MCKENNA: The constitutionality of the 

statute with regard to the union's First Amendment 

rights is not at issue here, Your Honor, no.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't it your position 

that this statute is constitutional either way you 

interpret it?

 MR. MCKENNA: Yes, Your Honor, it is. Your 

Honor, I'd like to make the further point that -- and I

think this is a fairly obvious point, but we think that 

since under your decisions the State can prohibit a 

union from collecting an agency fee altogether, that it 

is reasonable for the State to impose a condition on 

that collection which falls, falls far short of actually 

prohibiting it. We further point out that in the Hudson 

case the Illinois statute at issue was effectively an 

opt-in statute, a statute under which no amount that was 

not germane could be collected in advance, unlike the 

more generous Washington State statute which allows the 

union, permits the union, to collect a fee in an amount 

equal to dues or would permit it to collect a fee which 

had been reduced in advance to reflect non-germane or 

reduced just to reflect 760 expenses.

 It seems to us that it is within the power 

of the State to establish such a condition in the 

interest of an election's integrity by means of 

protecting the First Amendment interests of the 

non-members, and we think the statute does that very 

well without imposing in fact a substantial 

administrative burden on the union in this case or 

unions in general. For example, the, the way that the 

WEA or any union can comply with Section 760 would be to 

simply place an additional form in the Hudson packet 

they send out. Now, recognizing that the Hudson packet

is about this thick, that it is received by the teachers 

in September, the busiest month of the year for 

teachers, and that there is no form currently provided 

in that packet whatsoever to allow people to opt out, 

but rather a statement that you must send a letter to 

the union to opt out, we think it's quite easy. And we 

look to the WEA PAC for instruction on what they could 

do. But now. Because the WEA has chosen to form a PAC 

and is required to solicit members and non-members if 

they choose in order to contribute to that PAC, they do 

a very good job of soliciting members. They include a 

very convenient form encouraging people to check off and 

send their dues in to the PAC to support candidate 

elections. They provide no such form for the opt-out 

process, but it would be easy for them to do so.

 The burden imposed on them is not great 

administratively, as they suggest, any more than the 

burden on the other teachers unions in Abood or in 

Hudson because it can easily be met through these 

simple.

 If there are no further questions, Your 

Honor, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE 

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice and may 

it please the Court:

 The statute at issue here imposes only a 

narrow limitation on the union's use of agency fees, 

namely by requiring the affirmative assent of the 

non-members before the union may use those funds for 

non- germane political expenditures. The statute does 

not limit the union's ability to spend its own money on 

political causes and every avenue that is available to 

any other organization in the State to solicit 

contributions from non- members remains available to the 

union.

 The court below nonetheless struck the 

statute down only by treating the workers' minimum 

constitutional rights as a constitutional ceiling as 

well as a floor. In the process, the court below 

rigidly constitutionalized an area of labor law in which 

the States and the Federal Government have at least 

since the Lochner era enjoyed substantial discretion to 

make labor policy. We would request that the Court 

reverse the decision below, but also reverse and restore 

room for play in the joints in this area of labor law.

 I think the starting problem with the

court's analysis below is that the rights that are at 

issue in this area principally are the rights of the 

individual workers. This court has recognized that 

agency shop itself raises significant First Amendment 

issues and First Amendment impingements and so the 

forced extraction of fees is justified only to the 

extent that it can be justified by the government's 

interest in maintaining labor peace or in avoiding free 

ridership. So as a minimum constitutional matter, the 

workers have to have an opt- out right. The question is 

whether the States can go further and either do an 

opt-in regime or do what was at issue in the Hudson case 

and not even allow the union to collect the non-germane 

funds in the first place from non-members.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Clement, if we reverse 

as you suggest and the State Supreme Court said, well, I 

guess we were wrong under the First Amendment, we just 

realized our State constitution requires the same 

result, would that judgment stand, do you think?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I think it might well. I 

mean, I think there might be an argument at that point 

that somehow the Federal Constitution requires more than 

opt-out rights. Certainly some of the amici have made 

that argument. The Davenport Petitioners have made that 

argument, and I suppose you could at that point confront

a second petition in this case.  But at least as a 

starting matter, I think that's an option that's 

available to the Washington Supreme Court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Washington -- at a 

minimum, I would assume that the Washington Supreme 

Court would not have constitutional avoidance as a 

crutch in order to reach that, to reach that conclusion, 

because there is no constitutional issue here under your 

view.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Right, though I mean -- I 

don't mean to be able to constrain the Washington 

Supreme Court's ability to find a State constitutional 

problem that it would then think there's a need to 

avoid.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are the courts in 

Washington State elected, do we know that? Are they 

elected?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: They are elected.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They are elected, so it's 

easier to blame it on us than it is for them to say, we 

hold as a matter of Washington law that this can't be 

done and we disallow what the people have voted for. 

That would be harder, a harder call, don't you think?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: It might be a harder call, 

Justice Scalia. I seem to recall a reference -- it

might have actually been in the court of appeals opinion 

rather than in the State Supreme Court opinion -- that 

as a general matter the Washington courts have not 

construed their First Amendment, State constituent First 

Amendment to be radically different than the Federal 

Constitution. So I would imagine there's going to be 

some State law that may limit their ability to do that. 

I'm certainly not an expert on the Washington State law 

of the First Amendment.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if this money is the 

non-union member's money and an opt-out -- I'm sorry --

opt-in scheme is not much of a burden on the unions, why 

should the First Amendment permit anything other than an 

opt-in scheme.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, it's a 

fair question. As I say, it's a question that's 

certainly raised by the Davenport Petitioners. I think 

there's an answer to it and I'll get to it in a minute. 

But I would say in fairness to Mr. -- one of the 

anomalies of this case is that in many respects I think 

that's a more difficult constitutional question than the 

one that the Washington Supreme Court answered adversely 

to Petitioners in this case.

 I think, if I can sketch an answer as to why 

it is that the opt out is the constitutional minimum and

there isn't as a matter of constitutional law required 

to be an opt-in right, I think it goes back to what the 

Court has construed as the relevant First Amendment 

interest here. And the Court has seemingly construed 

the relevant First Amendment interest here in not having 

a compelled extraction, and as part and parcel of the 

constitutional violation, it seems to have assumed 

there's a need for a stated objection. And I think 

that's where you get the opt-out right.

 And so if you put it in the analogy, an 

analogous compelled speech context like Willie against 

Maynard and the New Hampshire license plate, in that 

context an important parcel of the violation is the 

objection to having "Live Free or Die" on your license 

plate. And the Court hasn't construed the compelled 

speech there to be that everybody has a compelled speech 

violation because they are presumptively forced to have 

the license plate on the back of their car. So I think 

that --

JUSTICE ALITO: The union can make it as 

difficult as it wants for somebody to opt out. They can 

send a packet that's this thick and not provide a form.

 MR. CLEMENT: I wouldn't think so, Justice 

Alito. And I think that there are two separate 

questions, I would think. One is, what is an adequate

set of procedures and protections for exercising the 

opt-out right? And then a separate question would be, 

do you actually have to go all the way to an opt-in 

right? And I think that there may well be many cases 

where the Hudson notice that's provided doesn't provide 

a sufficient constitutional opportunity.  I mean, you 

have in a case like this, a 100-page packet, I'm told, 

that has no -- no form in it that you're supposed to 

return to opt out. You basically have to go to the 

third page, find the address of the president of the 

union, and then send in a letter.

 And I think it's instructive if you look in 

the joint appendix, I think it's at page joint appendix 

45, you have the form that's available to union members 

to opt in to PAC contributions, and have payroll 

deductions made for the PAC contributions. The union 

certainly makes it much easier to opt in to PAC 

contributions than it makes it to opt out vis a vis the 

Hudson packet.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it relevant, General 

Clement, that the legislature didn't seem to be, or the 

ballot initiative didn't seem to be focused at all on 

beefing up the rights of the non-member of the union? 

It seemed to be concerned with the integrity of the 

election process, because they left the same old Hudson

in place for union nongermane spending that didn't have 

to do with elections.

 MR. CLEMENT: That's absolutely right, 

Justice Ginsburg, and I think the way we look at it is 

that this whole debate about the purpose of the 

provision is a little bit of a red herring, because at 

the end of the day it's clearly a hybrid. If you look 

at the text, it's hard to understand how it does not 

have at least the effect of protecting workers. On the 

other hand, you're absolutely right that it doesn't 

address the entirety of germane, of non-germane 

expenses. It addressed a subset that have the most 

direct impact on the election process.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or even nongermane 

political expenses.

 MR. CLEMENT: That's true. That's true, I 

mean, for example, a nongermane lobbying expense which 

you might consider to be political in some broad sense, 

is not covered by the opt-in and remains subject to the 

Hudson opt out right.

 But I don't think that there is certainly 

anything problematic about that. It's not like the 

interest in protecting electoral integrity is some sort 

of forbidden government interest that makes this a 

suspicious piece of legislation. And I think at the

end, if you again put the text of the relevant provision 

together with the overall purpose, it's clear that it's 

trying to protect the rights of workers but it's doing 

so in service of a broader intent of improving electoral 

integrity, and I could suggest where maybe the 

Washington Supreme Court went awry in its analysis, it 

focused almost exclusively on the three stated purposes 

that were included in the text of Initiative 134, which 

were all focused more on electoral integrity.

 That's not surprising, because there were 36 

sections in Initiative 134 that dealt with the whole 

manner of different campaign finance initiatives. 

Before this initiative was passed by the voters of 

Washington there weren't any campaign contribution 

limits in the State of Washington.

 So this initiative is doing a lot more work, 

just besides Section 760. I think 760 isn't unrelated 

to those broader purposes because it does make sure that 

the contributions of the workers here are voluntary, and 

I think that is certainly something that's very similar 

to what Federal law accomplishes through the separate 

segregated fund requirements.

 If I could make just one note about the fact 

that this targets unions and not other entities, I think 

two points are relevant. The first is that argument was

very clearly waived, and if you look at footnote 6 of 

the Washington Supreme Court opinion which is at 25a of 

the -- of the State's petition appendix, it's clear that 

any argument about the, the disparate treatment of 

unions versus corporations or other entities was not 

before that court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, are there any other 

such entities that are given the power by the State to 

collect money from people against their will?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: You've anticipated my 

second point, which is the power that's being -- I mean, 

it's no accident that they targeted this particular 

power or this particular issue because it has always 

been understood to be an anomaly in this area. That the 

unions have a right to effectively take a claim on the 

paycheck on people who are nonmembers of the union. 

These are individuals who have already opted out of 

union membership, and that is a sufficient anomaly and 

sufficiently unlike any other context that I think there 

is nothing that prevents the State of Washington from 

targeting that problem and that problem alone.

 If there are no further questions, thank 

you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. WEST,

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. WEST: Thank you, Mr. Chief -- Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 Our submission that Section 760 

unconstitutionally burdens the union's First Amendment 

right to engage in political advocacy rests on three 

points. One, the statute before the Court is a campaign 

finance law that was enacted for the purpose of 

protecting the public's interest in the integrity of the 

electoral process. Two, it is a content-based 

restriction on speech, which cannot be justified by the 

State's authority to limit agency fees in the first 

place. Three, the statute does not serve a compelling 

State interest both because it is overbroad in 

restricting, restricting speech on ballot propositions 

and because it's underinclusive in regulating the 

campaign speech of unions but not of other comparably 

situated entities.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are the First Amendment 

rights of the union members, of the workers who are 

non-union members relevant?

 MR. WEST: Uh, the First Amendment rights --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, you -- you begin 

by talking about the First Amendment but you, you

proceed as if there are no First Amendment rights of, of 

workers involved at all.

 MR. WEST: The -- the -- the nonmember 

employees certainly have a First Amendment right not to 

be compelled to finance, help finance political, 

ideological and other nongermane expenditures over their 

objection. And that right is fully protected 

independently of 760 by the Hudson process, and as the 

Washington Supreme Court held, when there is the 

availability of a ready means for opting out of that 

participation in, in financing those causes, there is no 

compelled speech. And this is what the, what the First 

Amendment gives to the nonmember fee payers.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I take it States 

have considerable discretion in determining how to 

protect Federal constitutional rights.

 MR. WEST: The States --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And absent some direction 

that we have to consider this as only being for a, for 

purposes of election transparency, it seems to me that 

Washington acted quite properly in saying we will use 

this mechanism in order to protect our workers' First 

Amendment constitutional rights.

 MR. WEST: Well, what the State is 

protecting, Justice Kennedy, is not the First Amendment

right itself which by definition is protected through 

the Hudson process.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why can't the State 

protect it more? I mean the fact that Hudson would be 

adequate -- it --

MR. WEST: The State --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- from that it does not 

follow that the State is not protecting the rights.

 MR. WEST: The State can certainly protect 

the interest that is protected by the First Amendment 

right more, or to a greater degree, but if it does so, 

it can only do so if it does not infringe on other 

constitutional rights. And if it does then the question 

is whether the State's regulation that infringes on 

other constitutional rights, in this case the union's 

First Amendment right of political advocacy, whether 

that infringement is justified by a compelling State 

interest.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And your claim as I take 

it, that there is an infringement with the union's right 

of political advocacy, is that if in effect the scheme 

restricts the union's use of its own funds?

 MR. WEST: The scheme restricts the, the use 

of funds that are, are properly collected from agency 

fee payers by the union and --

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. You agree that 

the union could segregate these funds as opposed to 

commingling them, and that would cure, that would in 

effect answer your, your constitutional objection?

 MR. WEST: Well, it wouldn't, because then 

the question is what do you do after you've segregated 

them. If the statute --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's clear from the 

statute that, that what you would do would be leave them 

subject to the opt-in determination, but all other 

funds, i.e., the funds that you are constitutionally 

entitled to protect, would be unencumbered.

 MR. WEST: Certainly Justice Souter, but 

then the question is, for those fee payers, and 

certainly there are going to be some out of three or 

four thousand that do not give affirmative 

authorization, then what do you do with their funds? 

And the, the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you think that would 

create an independent constitutional problem assuming 

that you did segregate the funds?

 MR. WEST: Justice Souter, the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That would, that would 

create an issue? You know, what if they say: Nothing? 

Maybe, maybe the statute does not deal adequately with

that. But does that raise a constitutional problem that 

in effect would be, would be of equal parity with the 

one that is, that is raised on behalf of the, the, the 

dissenting workers?

 MR. WEST: Justice Souter, the reason it 

raises a constitutional problem is because of the 

content discrimination issue. What the State is saying 

is that you have a right to collect an agency fee that 

is the full equivalent of union dues, but if you choose 

to spend any money from your treasury for electoral 

advocacy, you may spend whatever you want from your 

treasury for -- for legislative lobbying, for public 

relations, for all kinds of other issues, forms of 

speech that are not chargeable to objectors. But if you 

choose to spend any for one particular type of speech, 

namely electoral advocacy, then you must segregate and 

refund a portion of the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's, under --

MR. WEST: -- to the fee payers.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Under the Federal law you 

can't even have this opt-in system. You have to have a 

separate organization as I understand, for the election. 

So there would be no, no possibility that the nonmember 

of the union, that funds would go to election financing.

 MR. WEST: Certainly, Justice Ginsburg.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's much harder on 

the union, I would think, isn't it?

 MR. WEST: Well, it's much harder on the 

union in that respect but not in the respect that's 

critical here, and that is the Federal law as well as 

the laws of all the other States who have, have required 

separate segregated funds limit that requirement to 

candidate elections.

 The, the reason this statute is 

unconstitutional, the reason it does not consist of a 

compelling, does not provide a compelling governmental 

interest in regulating elections, is because it goes far 

beyond the permissible realm of regulating expenditures 

on candidate elections, and prohibits the union without 

affirmative authorization from spending its funds for 

ballot propositions.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You're -- you're back to 

its funds again.

 MR. WEST: Whether they're --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And you're saying, first 

you said well, segregating the funds does not answer the 

problem. And I thought the reason it didn't answer the 

problem was that the, that it was, that the purposes of 

the, of the act were underinclusive. And now you're 

responding to Justice Ginsburg by going back to making

the assumption that the segregated funds would be the 

union's funds.

 MR. WEST: Justice Souter, if they are 

segregated, if the union segregates them, assuming they 

don't -- for those for whom they don't receive 

affirmative authorization, they keep them in escrow 

indefinitely, or they put them in a locked box and never 

do anything with them, certainly the union would satisfy 

the statute in -- in that way.

 But what, what the statute says as 

interpreted by the trial court, if then the union puts 

those funds back into its general treasury, or even if 

it doesn't, and spends them in some way for some purpose 

whatever, that it's violating the statute. And the only 

way that the union can comply is by not only segregating 

the funds, but then if affirmative authorization is not 

received, by rebating a certain portion of the fund to 

the individual fee payers.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I thought that 

approach was exactly what we held was required in the 

Street decision, the International Association of 

Machinists versus Street, so that you can't get around 

this requirement by saying, oh well, we'll use the 

objectors' funds for collective bargaining and we'll use 

the others for that.

MR. WEST: Sure. Exactly. And that's --

and that's why I think that that interpretation of the 

statute may be correct. But the problem we have here is 

this is a statute, and why it's unconstitutional is this 

is a statute that is saying this only with respect to a 

particular kind of speech. It's saying the union may 

collect a hundred percent of dues and it may spend them 

in whatever way it deems appropriate for --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Doesn't that 

objection apply whether it's opt in or opt out?

 MR. WEST: No, it doesn't, Mr. Chief 

Justice, because the -- the -- in -- in the Street and 

Abood decisions, the Court has -- has said that there is 

-- all -- has talked in terms of expenditures that are 

not germane to collective bargaining.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it content 

discrimination which subjects legislation to strict 

scrutiny if the Government, Federal Government or a 

State designates certain funds for use by school 

districts to teach patriotism, American history, 

something like that? Is that subject to strict 

scrutiny?

 MR. WEST: No, because this is Government 

funding. This is --

it's not Government funding. Instead of doing that the 

Government says, you will have authority to collect 

money from certain people only for a particular purpose. 

Is that content discrimination which calls into play 

strict scrutiny?

 MR. WEST: I believe it is, Justice Scalia, 

because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see why the one is 

any worse than the other. The Government has a 

particular purpose in mind and in one case it gives out 

money with that purpose in mind, which discriminates of 

course; in the other case it allows this extraordinary 

power to exact funds from people, but only for certain 

purposes. That's not the kind of content discrimination 

that they calls strict scrutiny into play, it seems to 

me.

 MR. WEST: It's strict scrutiny if it's not 

the Government acting as the speaker, and the Government 

is acting here as --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Here is the Government 

acting as a coercer. It's because of the Government 

that you're allowed to get this money from these 

non-union members.

 MR. WEST: Well, I don't believe the Court 

has ever put it quite that way in the Government speech

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question on 

your overinclusive, or underinclusive rather, argument? 

Supposing the statute was broader and said the union may 

not use any non-member agency fee collections for any 

non-germane purpose at all without affirmative consent? 

Would that solve all the constitutional problems?

 MR. WEST: I think the problem here -- let 

me say two things in response to that, Justice Stevens.

or no, and then explain?

yes and no. The answer is, if you're talking about --

(Laughter.)

be that was, that statute would be okay.

what you're doing is talking about the, an election 

statute like --

absolutely have to. And the legislature decides to

agency sock fees for any non-germane purpose. What's 

wrong with that?

 MR. WEST: That, Justice Stevens, if this is 

what the state is saying with respect to the public 

sector employees as to which it has the authority to 

regulate the agency fee. This is perfectly 

constitutional. This is the kind of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If that's perfectly 

constitutional, this is a fortiori okay.

 MR. WEST: It's not --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And it's less of a burden 

on the union and there's less protection to the 

employee.

 MR. WEST: No, it's not. It's a different 

case for two reasons, Justice Stevens. First of all, 

because it's content discriminatory. It's not saying 

the -- it's not saying you -- we limit the agency fee to 

the nonchargeable, the non-germane, or to the purposes 

that are germane to collective bargaining. The State 

can permissibly do that because it's making --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't that a 

content-based restriction? You've got to look at it and 

see if it's germane.

are a wide variety of different kinds of speech and 

non-speech activities, not only political speech but 

public relations. Many courts have interpreted 

organizing activities to be non-germane to collective 

bargaining. Membership benefits that are not available, 

non-members are put in that category. Donations to 

charities. International activities. There's a whole 

variety of union expenditures that the courts have held 

are not germane to collective bargaining and cannot be 

charged over a non-member's objection, and a State would 

be perfectly free, as several states like Pennsylvania 

and New Mexico have, to say our judgment is that our 

interest in labor peace does not extend further than in 

authorizing an agency fee that includes purposes germane 

to collective bargaining.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm just curious below in 

the opinion, I didn't notice in footnote 6, which I 

hadn't taken in, that the court explicitly says that you 

did not make any argument about underinclusiveness and 

overinclusiveness with respect to other organizations, 

corporations and so forth.

 Now, did -- I can't recall, I just don't 

recall. What you're saying now, I take it, is that the 

word "election," you can't use it for elections, and 

elections involve candidates and they also involve

they discuss that at some length in the lower court 

opinion? I don't --

MR. WEST: The lower court, no, did not 

discuss the --

JUSTICE BREYER: So this is really a ground 

that they haven't considered.

 MR. WEST: What the Washington Supreme Court 

held is that the -- what was argued in the Washington 

Supreme Court generally is that this is a violation of 

the union's right to engage in political advocacy.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But this thing about the 

ballot issue is not there.

 MR. WEST: And the reason -- this is a 

reason I think the Washington Supreme Court took note of 

the fact of what the funds were spent on, on balloting 

initiatives solely, not on candidate elections.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In fact, you want to us

decide that question, and was there another one that --

you just said there were two reasons basically.

 MR. WEST: Well, the two reasons why the 

statute fails to constitute a compelling Government 

interest are the overbroad extension to ballot 

propositions, unlike the Federal law and any other State 

law. And secondly, the underinclusiveness that this is 

a statute that is ostensibly intended to protect the 

integrity of the elections by ensuring that the funds 

that organizations spend for political electoral 

purposes represent the views of the people from whom 

those funds were derived. And the -- what the State has 

chosen to regulate to advance that interest is solely 

people who already have the opportunity to prevent the 

use of their funds for purposes they disagree with, 

while not regulating at all other entities in which --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the argument 

that the State Supreme Court in footnote 6 expressly 

said you did not raise.

 MR. WEST: I think that would be a valid 

argument if we were attempting to raise an equal 

protection claim here, Mr. Chief Justice. That's not 

what we're doing. What we're saying, we are making an 

argument based on what the State Supreme Court held, 

namely that this is a violation of the -- the union's

right to engage in political speech, and this is one of 

the reasons for it. Granted, that particular 

justification for the ruling was not argued below, but 

this is not like we were attempting to argue equal 

protection, a totally new basis.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: On which -- on what you 

were arguing, you were very careful in your brief to say 

funds lawfully possessed by the union, as distinguished 

from what's in a corporate treasury or -- there is 

something peculiar about this, and you recognized it by 

saying we possess them, because if the non-member wants 

it back, the non-member would be entitled. So it's not 

like money in the corporate till.

 MR. WEST: Well, it is, Justice Ginsburg, if 

the -- this is why the purpose of the statute is so 

important. If the purpose of the statute is to protect 

the integrity of the elections by ensuring that what 

organizations spend for political purposes represents 

the views of those who contributed the money, then it's 

very much to the point that there are other 

organizations. For example, the Michigan Chamber of 

Commerce --

MR. WEST: Absolutely -- absolutely not, 

Justice Kennedy. We recognize --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's been your whole 

argument so far.

 MR. WEST: Absolutely not. I'm sorry, 

Justice Kennedy, but that's certainly not what I intend 

to be saying. We recognize that the non-members have 

First Amendment rights. We also recognize that those 

rights are protected by the Hudson procedures which the 

union uses. The non-members have the absolute right to 

prevent the use of their funds not only for this kind of 

electoral speech but for any kind of political 

ideological speech and other nonchargeable activities 

with which they disagree simply by sending in a letter.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So it's a First Amendment 

right that is waived by failing to make a timely 

objection.

 MR. WEST: Well, it's not that a right is 

waived. What it is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's gone under your 

theory.

 MR. WEST: No. It's -- Justice Stevens, 

it's what the right is. The constitutional right is a 

right against being required to -- to engage in 

compelled speech.

-- the license plate case. Someone who receives in the 

mail the license plate that says "Live Free or Die" or 

"Taxation Without Representation" and puts it on his car

JUSTICE ALITO: It's not exactly the same 

situation. These are teachers who have chosen not to 

join the Washington Education Association; isn't that 

right?

 MR. WEST: These are teachers who have not 

joined the Washington Education --

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it overwhelmingly 

likely that they, if you spoke to them and you said 

would you like to give money to the union to spend on 

elections, they would say no?

 MR. WEST: I absolutely disagree with you, 

Justice Alito, because keep in mind --

JUSTICE ALITO: Explain to me the thinking 

of somebody who chooses not to join, the 5 percent who 

choose not to join, and yet they would like to make this 

contribution. Now maybe there's some, but what would be

your money is used for this purpose. But keep in mind 

what the money is being used for here.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference 

between that?

 MR. WEST: The money is being used --

JUSTICE ALITO: What's the difference 

between saying would you like to make a contribution, 

and would you like to allow us to use money that we 

possess for our purposes rather than returning it to us? 

What's the difference between those two?

 MR. WEST: Well, whether there is a 

difference or not, Justice Alito, the point is the union 

here is using this money for purposes that it has every 

reason to believe is in the interest of the vast 

majority of teachers, including --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well surely, they 

get to make that decision, don't they? Under the 

statute, it's their decision whether or not -- you don't 

get to say, well, this is in your interests, or whether 

you'd want to spend the money or not.

 MR. WEST: No, but I'm responding to the 

suggestion that there should be some kind of presumption 

that they would, would decline to authorize this.

That's -- the question you raised, Mr. Chief Justice, is 

exactly the question before the Court, whether the State 

can, constitutionally can insist that the union obtain 

affirmative authorization for this particular type of 

speech and for no other type of speech. Let me -- let 

me suggest --

JUSTICE ALITO: I still don't understand the 

thinking of these hypothetical people. If I'm a union 

member, I get various benefits. If I choose not to be a 

union member, I don't get those benefits. Why would I 

choose to give up the benefits of union membership and 

yet want to allow the union to spend my money for its 

political purposes?

 MR. WEST: Well, maybe Mr. -- Justice Alito, 

if you knew that what the union was spending its money 

for was to improve, to increase cost of living 

adjustments for teachers or to reduce class size for 

teachers, or to enact tax levies in local school 

districts --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is this all hypothetical, 

Mr. West, or is there any empirical evidence about what 

the people who are non-union members, if they had their 

druthers, would they say not a penny more goes into the 

union till than we are forced to put there? Is there 

any empirical evidence that divides up the universe of

people who don't, deliberately don't join unions?

 MR. WEST: No. Justice Ginsburg, there's a 

lot of speculation on both sides. I don't think there's 

any empirical evidence, but there is plenty of reason to 

think that there are many reasons that people choose not 

to join the union, whether from a free rider motivation, 

whether from just not being a joiner, any variety of 

reasons. Some of them may be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you're free 

under this system to send them the same sort of 

materials you send about your PAC and say we do all 

sorts of good things with the money from people who opt 

in, you should opt in.

 MR. WEST: Yeah.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you want to do 

it without giving them that opportunity.

 MR. WEST: Well, the question is whether the 

State can compel us to, to obtain that authorization for 

this limited type of speech.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Only if the State has given 

you the power to exact the money from these people. 

That changes everything. If this was money that they 

had contributed themselves, you'd have a different 

argument, but the State compels them to give you that 

money and the State says however, you will not use this

money for this purpose without their consent.

 MR. WEST: It doesn't change everything, 

Justice Scalia, precisely for the reasons that you 

discussed in your opinion for the court in RAV versus 

St. Paul, the St. Paul cross-burning case, where you 

pointed out that, that the greater includes the lesser 

argument does not apply where you have content 

discrimination. The State could justifiably ban all 

symbols and displays that involve fighting words, but it 

could not single out a particular --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That brings us back to the 

question I asked earlier and I suggested in my answer to 

that I don't think it's content discrimination of the 

sort that triggers strict scrutiny when the government 

gives money for a particular purpose only and not for 

other purposes, and I also don't think it's content 

discrimination of the sort that triggers strict scrutiny 

when the government allows a private organization to use 

governmental power to exact money from people for a 

particular purpose only. That's a different ball game.

 MR. WEST: Justice Scalia, imagine, if I may 

take a little bit starker example, imagine that what the 

government said in the statute that the union must 

obtain affirmative authorization if it is going to use 

agency fee funds to support Democratic candidates, but

not if it's going to support Republican candidates. 

Obviously it couldn't do that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And I see that you've put a 

lot of weight on this argument.

 MR. WEST: And that -- it goes further than 

this. That's viewpoint discrimination. But this is 

content discrimination and the Court has held in 

Consolidated Edison and a number of other cases that 

that is also a constitutional problem.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What you're saying right 

now, if it is, is ballots versus candidates under the 

word "election."

 MR. WEST: Exactly.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And that has a lot of 

implications for all kinds of campaign finance law that 

has nothing to do, I think, with unions.

 MR. WEST: Exactly.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And the lower court didn't 

consider it, and is this open now, if it's going back 

for other things such as the State Constitution, for 

them to consider this matter on remand?

 MR. WEST: I think it would be open to them 

to consider. I also think it's a matter that when we 

get to that point at least --

you don't know, what the implication of a decision say 

in your favor here would have for Vermont's campaign 

finance law or California's or some other.

 MR. WEST: Perhaps, but it's certainly true 

that on this, at least on this point of the lack of any 

compelling justification for restricting entities' 

contributions and expenditures in support of or in 

opposition to ballot propositions, the law, this Court's 

law, is fully clearly on that point.

 It's our submission, Mr. Chief Justice, that 

what you have here is a content-based restriction on 

WEA's ability to engage in political speech on issues of 

educational policy that are of vital importance to the 

70,000 teachers that it represents.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the State have a 

restriction requiring affirmative authorization for all 

union expenditures that fall within the Abood-Machinist 

line of cases?

 MR. WEST: Yes. If this were --

particularly if this were --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If this were across the 

board as to all First Amendment rights an objecting 

member has, then the statute would be void -- would be 

valid, rather?

the statute that authorized the agency fee in the first 

place.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, it's done in this 

statute.

 MR. WEST: If it's done in this statute, the 

problem that would remain, Justice Kennedy, is this is 

an election law that presumably has to be justified on 

the basis of whether it promotes the integrity of 

elections. And when you have --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, my hypothetical is 

that there's a Washington statute or a Washington 

constitutional referendum provision, initiative 

provision, which says that as to all protected speech 

for non- union members who have moneys taken out, there 

must be affirmative authorization.

 MR. WEST: The State could do that, at least 

if it limited it to the public sector, where the State 

has the authority to authorize the amount of the agency 

fee. I believe the State could do that. The State 

could certainly -- some people have talked about the 

size of the Hudson notice. The State could impose 

requirements that the notice be clearer, that it be 

shorter. The state could impose that affirmative 

authorization requirement. The State could limit the --

 MR. WEST: Well, I think that would be a 

problem, too. And that's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Okay.

 MR. WEST: That would be viewpoint 

discriminatory, but here we have a legislative statute 

that, that it's content discriminatory, that can't be 

justified as a compelling State interest to promote the 

integrity of the elections, and we believe the judgment 

of the Washington Supreme Court should be affirmed.

joint appendix at 210-212. These are the pages covering 

the permanent injunction that was entered by the trial 

court. Under that permanent injunction, the WEA shall 

return to all agency fee payers who have not 

affirmatively authorized the use of their fees for 

expenditures, and it lays out the means of doing that. 

For the first 2 years there's an agreed-upon amount. 

For the next 3 years of the injunction there's another 

amount. But they do get their money back under that 

injunction.

 Referring to the issue of whether they waive 

or not, under the current process used by the WEA, 

referring to JA-198, which is the letter sent out on 

September 15, 2000, by the WEA to the non-members, 

you'll note the statement, quote: "If such written 

objection has not been postmarked by October 16, 2000, 

you will waive your ability to object." The State of 

Washington's position is that non-members should not be 

required to say no twice. They said no when they chose 

not to join the union. The union's position now is, 

well, we get to use your money for political purposes 

unless you say no a second time. That does not seem to 

be a reasonable default position to take and certainly 

we believe the State --

Washington seems to think that's fine for everything 

other than election expenses.

 MR. MCKENNA: Yes, Your Honor, in terms of 

Section 760 the State of Washington does think that's 

fine because of the purpose of the statute and the 

purpose of Section 760, the purpose being to protect the 

integrity of the elections by several different means 

involving protecting --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, do you see an 

underlying constitutional problem as to non-election 

expenditures that are still political expenditures?

 MR. MCKENNA: We don't take a position on 

whether there's a constitutional problem with regard to 

non- germane expenditures, Your Honor. But we do 

believe --

in Abood?

position in Abood?

the statute works, you have to opt in for the election 

expenditures, but you have to have a right to opt out 

for other non-germane.

Justice is correct, of course. What I thought the 

question was about was the question of whether or not 

all, all non-germane expenses must be opt-in, must be 

provided. That's all I meant. You're absolutely 

correct. Of course, in your decisions opt-out is 

satisfactory, and we're not saying that opt-out is not 

satisfactory here as far as the State's position is 

concerned. But what we are saying is that the State has 

the right to impose this additional requirement of 

affirmative authorization.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What do you say about his 

hypothetical involving Democrats versus Republicans?

 MR. MCKENNA: Well, Your Honor, that would 

certainly seem to be viewpoint discrimination, and it 

would implicate --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, he says, well, this 

is content discrimination. Is that --

MR. MCKENNA: Your Honor, we do not agree 

that this is content, content discrimination. This is 

content neutral. 760 establishes a procedure, that is 

to say a requirement that must be met before the money 

may be used.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but it's content in 

the sense that only some speech has to be affirmatively

authorized.

 MR. MCKENNA: Yes, Your Honor, that 

additional affirmative authorization does apply to this 

category of speech, influencing an election or operating 

a political committee.  But we don't believe that it is 

problematic constitutionally any more than the argument 

of Taxpayers With Representations in the Reagan case 

was, where they argued that they had a constitutional 

right to receive tax deductible contributions and use 

them for lobbying. The Court found to the contrary. 

And indeed, Initiative 134 is about protecting 

individuals. It's about protecting individuals in 

Section 760. It says in the intent section --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I just go back to, you 

mentioned my question.

 MR. MCKENNA: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Your point of your answer 

to his hypothetical is, well, the viewpoint 

discrimination would be impermissible, but the content 

discrimination is permissible?

 MR. MCKENNA: If it is content 

discrimination, Your Honor, we believe it is 

permissible, yes, sir. And if it were viewpoint -- in 

the hypothetical, if there were viewpoint discrimination 

that would not implicate any constitutional right of the

union, but it may very well implicate the Southworth 

interests of the non-member fee payers.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it content? I 

mean, it doesn't say which way you're trying to 

influence the election.

 MR. MCKENNA: We don't believe it is 

content-based, Your Honor. As I said, we don't believe 

it is, because it's any election of any kind.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the content means a 

category of speech as opposed to what is the political 

position you're taking.

 MR. MCKENNA: Yes, that is it's only in 

regard to influencing elections or operating a political 

committee, which is a second.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that that 

was content. You could do it, say, in the press, but 

you couldn't do it over the air.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's my understanding, 

too. I think you got to get out of it some other way. 

I mean, you've got to say it's content but it doesn't 

apply when it's the government contributing money or it 

doesn't apply when you're applying it to money that's 

being coerced by the government.

category here is election speech. If you're going to 

call a statute that treats election speech especially, 

then all of campaign finance regulation would fall in 

that category. And if you're going to use that 

distinction to say strict scrutiny applies, then strict 

scrutiny would apply to all campaign finance regulation. 

And courts never to my knowledge apply strict scrutiny 

to campaign finance regulation because there are speech 

interests on both sides of the equation.

 MR. MCKENNA: Yes, Your Honor. Of course, 

we believe that --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm glad you said yes to me 

because that implies a no to the last question.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MCKENNA: Yes, Your Honor, I understand 

your question.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MCKENNA: And we believe that -- we 

believe of course that Section 760 is not subject to 

strict scrutiny, it is subject at most to a rationale 

basis; and that clearly there is a rationale basis for 

the State in this case to require the affirmative 

authorization of non-member fee payers.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you get to the point 

you were about to make, what the purpose of the thing

is?

 MR. MCKENNA: Well, yes, Your Honor. Your 

Honor, the Supreme Court of Washington found a purpose 

of the entire law, Initiative 134, to be to protect 

election integrity. But 760 is one means of achieving 

that purpose by means of protecting individual 

interests. Similarly, Section 680 of this law, which, I 

apologize, is not in the joint appendix, but it's RCW 

4217-680, which requires positive checkoff before an 

employer may deduct PAC contributions for any employee.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I just -- I'm sorry. 

May I just take you back to the point of the objective 

being protection of election integrity. As I understand 

it, so far as the protection of election integrity is 

concerned, with respect to these contributions, that is 

simply the obverse side or the flip side, if you will, 

of protecting the right of the dissenting union member 

or the non-joined -- strike that -- the non-union 

worker, to control the use of the funds that would be 

used for the political purposes. The one is simply the 

obverse of the other. Do you agree?

 MR. MCKENNA: Yes, Your Honor. We believe 

they are two sides of the same coin.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So by articulating that the 

election integrity is a purpose, the Washington Supreme

 MR. MCKENNA: Yes, Your Honor. I would

 Thank you.

 The case is submitted.
