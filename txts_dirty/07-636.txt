 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 07-636, Kennedy v. The Plan Administrator 

for DuPont Savings and Investment Plan.

 Mr. Furlow.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. FURLOW

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. FURLOW: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 As this Court has confined consideration of 

the matters before the Court to certiorari issue number 

5 concerning qualified domestic relations orders, or 

QDROs as they are called, I will confine my argument to 

arguing that the Fifth Circuit erred in holding that the 

only way a divorcing spouse can waive the right to 

pension benefits is by executing a QDRO. I have four 

basic arguments to present today. I'll give them in 

thumbnail sketch form first.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You did in your reply 

brief address the plan question?

 MR. FURLOW: Yes, Your Honor. I did so 

after stating that we believe that the matter was 

properly confined to the certiorari issue number three, 

but out of an abundance of caution and subject to

objection I did respond to the argument leveled against 

us by I think it is five amici and by DuPont itself. We 

nevertheless, I prepared my original briefing on the 

merits to address the QDRO issue and that's where you 

see it focused. We have four basic issues.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The problem is that is 

that if you, even if we hold for you on that issue, you 

could still lose on the plan documents rule, right.

 MR. FURLOW: Well, Your Honor, I think that 

instead this Court might choose well to follow what the 

concurrence said in the recent LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg 

case, emphasizing that where the court of appeals below 

has not passed on the central issue of a case and where 

most of the fire that the one party is responding to 

comes from amici, that it is appropriate to remand the 

case to that court so that that court may pass on the 

central issue, especially in the situation where, as 

here, the Fifth Circuit did not even mention the plan 

document's role, but based its decision solely on a 

misinterpretation of the QDRO language.

 Of course, here, in the interest of candor, 

Dupont did in fact address in brief format -- a page or 

to, several pages -- in its motion for summary judgment 

the plan document's role and raised that matter again in 

the Fifth Circuit. It's just the Fifth Circuit did not

consider or pass on that because it relied solely on 

Dupont's argument that the Fifth Circuit should adhere 

to what it believed to be the Department of Treasury's 

interpretation of the anti-alienation statute. The 

Department of the Treasury and the Department of Labor, 

now in a harmonized stance, have come forth and in their 

amicus for the government supports our position that the 

Fifth Circuit erred in its interpretation of the QDRO 

statute, and that's the position we take.

 JUSTICE BREYER: At the end of your 

argument, could you just spend a minute because my state 

of mind is I'm sorry we limited it. You've sort of 

briefed this question pretty fully.

 MR. FURLOW: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And I'm tempted to try to 

decide it. I know you want to make your four points. 

Go right ahead. But at the end, could you possibly say, 

why shouldn't we just go ahead and decide the substance, 

not as a technical matter. Are we really going to get 

something out of remanding it that we don't already 

know? But don't do that now, but whenever you want.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We know what's going to 

happen on remand, though, don't we? Doesn't the Fifth 

Circuit already have case law on -- on that question?

 MR. FURLOW: The Fifth Circuit already has

case law. They have stated that, but they consider some 

of the other cases and they might consider this Court's 

ruling addressing the interpretation of the QDRO 

provision; that might provide them additional 

enlightenment as to how they should address the 

other issue.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But again as a preliminary 

matter, am I on the same page with Justice Ginsburg? Or 

would it be a different question? I'm curious to know 

why the beneficiary designation and change provisions at 

page 48, number 29c, beneficiaries, couldn't have been 

invoked here. Is that the same question Justice 

Ginsburg was asking?

 MR. FURLOW: I do not believe so, Justice 

Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because the plan does 

contain a procedure for designating some other 

beneficiary, including the spouse. I just don't 

understand why anybody doesn't talk about that.

 MR. FURLOW: Well, Your Honor, there was 

that provision for invoking another beneficiary and we 

only pointed out that indeed three days after the 

divorce, and consistent with his ex-wife's waiver of any 

right, title, claim and interest in this 401(k) plan in 

specific, and that was the very first item of the things

that he retained as the plan participant in that divorce 

decree, he did in fact designate his sole daughter Kari 

Kennedy as his sole beneficiary in a change of form plan 

for one part of this very complex series of multiple 

plans -- of plan retirement benefits where he said that 

he would give -- that she would be his sole beneficiary; 

and the form there that DuPont drafted for him said that 

it invoked and superseded any and all prior 

designations, and was not limited to that one particular 

part 6 pension and retirements plan. And so we submit 

it is a reasonable explanation, if he did not believe 

that his wife had waived any right, title and interest 

to invoke that beneficiary clause, pursuant to the Fifth 

Circuit's decision just six weeks beforehand in the 

Brandon v Travelers International case that said that a 

waiver of ERISA benefits, welfare benefits mainly -- but 

ERISA waiver of benefits, a voluntary waiver was 

enforceable, was valid and could be enforced at summary 

judgment.

 We believe his counsel, you know, were aware 

of that in formulating, you know, this waiver of 

benefits. Even if that didn't take care of Liv 

Kennedy's knowing, voluntary, attorney-negotiated, 

court-approved, signed-by-her waiver of any right, 

title, claim and interest in his pension benefits, then

we believe he may have believed as a layman that by 

signing that beneficiary designation form prepared by 

DuPont, that he had indeed superseded and revoked all 

prior designations.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Or he might have -- he 

might have decided that he didn't want to revoke that 

one. We -- we just have no way of knowing. It's odd 

that he revoked as to one plan but not the 501(k) plan, 

as I understand.

 MR. FURLOW: Your Honor, I might -- I might, 

if I would, just offer an explanation. He almost 

certainly saw no reason to revoke that which his wife 

had just four days before voluntarily waived any right, 

title, claim and interest to in terms of the divorce. 

He certainly would have expected that her word would be 

her bond and that it wouldn't turn out to be a junk bond 

as it turned out to be when years later she repudiated 

her own voluntary waiver; and that's just one of the 

issues that we address.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, because he could --

he could have -- despite her waiver, he could have named 

her as the beneficiary of that plan and that would have 

controlled.

 MR. FURLOW: Well, Your Honor, the way I see 

it is that his attorneys who were advising him and

guiding him through this process, they were acting, we 

must assume, in complete awareness of Texas and Fifth 

Circuit law; and the Fifth Circuit had just ruled some 

six weeks before in a case involving voluntary divorce 

decree waivers that such a waiver was enforceable. Now 

you don't have to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry; six weeks 

before what?

 MR. FURLOW: Before the divorce decree in 

the Brandon v. Travelers International case. We believe 

that there was no sense there in bombing the rubble. If 

it was already taken care of, it didn't have to be taken 

care of the second time. Now, I and you might want a 

belt-and-suspenders approach to be absolutely, doubly, 

positively sure. But the fundamental thing is if under 

Federal common law, as a majority of courts and almost 

all of the State courts have ruled, a voluntary waiver 

is enforceable, then that was already taken care of.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but how does 

the plan know that?

 MR. FURLOW: The plan knows that, as here, 

when the court-appointed fiduciary, the executrix Kari 

Kennedy makes the plan aware of that on April 26, 2001, 

via fax and delivery, which is acknowledged by their 

plan administrator, Mary Deneen that's coming in, and

there you have a copy of the divorce decree served on 

DuPont months before they make a payout.

 And it is critical here, Your Honor, that 

when they chose to make this -- you know, when they 

chose to pay the beneficiary, they were working on a 

test case right there from the very beginning. And if 

you look at their paralegal's letter, who actually 

notifies the estate that they are going to disregard the 

voluntary test case, they refer to DuPont's success in 

raising this issue before. And then the paralegal 

actually quotes a Fifth Circuit case that holds for 

voluntary waivers, obviously not understanding the, you 

know, crucial import here; and we note --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the plan terms 

say that if you want to change the beneficiary, here's 

how you've got to change the beneficiary; and we are 

going to pay the beneficiary until it's changed.

 MR. FURLOW: Well, Your Honor, I would also 

say that the plan forms here at page 48 of your joint 

appendix, and 49 -- I ask this Court to scrutinize these 

two provisions because they are critical to the outcome 

of the case. At page 48 you hear the following 

mandatory language in DuPont's own SIP. And it says: 

"If no surviving spouse exists and no beneficiary 

designation is in effect, distribution shall" --

mandatory term -- "shall be made to or in accordance 

with the directions of the executor or administrator of 

the decedent's estate." And so we say that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought 

your friend on the other side would be quoting that 

language.

 MR. FURLOW: Well, Your Honor, I like to 

bring a fresh insight to the -- to the -- to the 

Petitioner's argument here because I see that language 

and we say it is not in effect. This Court has ruled in 

several cases what the term "in effect" means, and in 

ERISA cases saying this version of ERISA was in effect, 

meaning valid and operational. Well, the voluntary 

waiver was in effect and that made the beneficiary 

designation some 10 years before during the course of 

the marriage ineffectual, invalid. And so --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's -- that's 

a bit of a stretch, isn't it? It says no beneficiary 

designation is in effect. If you look at the plan, he's 

got a beneficiary designation.

 MR. FURLOW: But it's not in effect at the 

time that it comes to be decided because their plan 

administrator Mary Deneen has a copy of the divorce 

decree with the knowing voluntary waiver. And although, 

Your Honor, although they take the position that plan

administrators can't understand knowing and voluntary 

waivers, that that's a law sort of thing, they have got 

one in-house counsel there who was never called upon to 

actually pass on this matter and it wouldn't have cost 

them a dime to go outside of that in-house counsel.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, that was 

the point of my earlier point. I focused on -- on this 

whole paragraph.

 MR. FURLOW: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That just indicates that 

this would have been a different case if the provision 

of the plan that said there shall be no assignment, 

which is quoted in the Fifth Circuit thing, was the only 

provision in the plan; but when you look through this in 

retrospect, there are means for participants and 

beneficiaries to make a change, and they weren't 

followed here.

 MR. FURLOW: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I understand that you 

say in effect they were. I understand that argument but 

it's not as if the plan didn't contain an adequate 

vehicle if the -- the parties had followed strictly the 

terms of the plan.

 MR. FURLOW: Your Honor, we submit that 

people all the time in situations like this may believe

that a knowing voluntary waiver which has received the 

approval of the majority of the Federal appellate courts 

and the State courts is good enough. In some other 

instances, they forget. They forget to do this or to 

make those changes, or believe that one of a series of 

multiple and overlapping beneficiary designations has --

as the June 7th one did, we submit -- revoked and 

superseded any and all prior designations, and they are 

lay people not lawyers.

 Now, I would submit that the critical thing 

is also on page 49 the very portion of the joint 

appendix that you're looking at, because that language 

says, in the DuPont SIP plan, quote, "if in the opinion 

of the company there is a question as to the legal right 

of any beneficiary to receive a distribution under the 

plan, the amount in question may be paid to the 

decedent's estate in which event the trustee and the 

company shall have no further liability to anyone in 

respect to such amounts." Consider that when you've 

heard all of the fear mongering that's come in, in the 

amici briefs with respect to -- to interpleader actions. 

And we submit that interpleader actions are a perfectly 

good means of disposing of this, but if you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's in the opinion 

of the company. That sounds -- and this is a plan -- as

we've said often in ERISA cases, we want to enforce 

these according to the terms of the plan because the 

companies don't have to set these up at all. So it 

makes perfect sense for the company to say, well, if we 

think this, then we can do this. So, in other words, 

there's a doubt and we don't want to give it to somebody 

who might not end up being the person, but if we don't 

think there's a doubt, that's it.

 MR. FURLOW: And that's the first step in 

the analysis, Your Honor, because the second step is all 

of this Supreme Court case and all of the substantial 

expenses that this estate out of Jasper, Texas, has had 

to pay from the very beginning could have been avoided 

had they paid over to Kari Kennedy, a court-appointed 

executrix who would have taken that money in and would 

have been bound by the rules of the probate court to 

handle it as a fiduciary to consider Liv's claim that 

her voluntary waiver was not voluntary, to pay the 

creditors first, rather than get stuck with the past 

liabilities, which happened here.

 The important thing is DuPont could have 

avoided all of this litigation, would not have had to 

file an interpleader, would not have had to incur a 

dime's worth of attorney's fees, would not have had to 

put its own interest ahead of that of the participants

and beneficiaries, had they simply invoked this clause 

as they had the power to do. They chose this case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: We can't decide this case 

based on sympathy to DuPont. I would understand the 

point of your argument. But if -- in theory the problem 

would be exactly the same, whether DuPont had expressed 

a doubt and paid it into the estate or hadn't.

 MR. FURLOW: The problem --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We have the same question 

before us.

 MR. FURLOW: The QDRO question, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. FURLOW: Yes, and that's why we say that 

if you look carefully at -- excuse me, but it's 29 

U.S.C. section 1056(b) through (k) -- you look at the 

specific language, and I am asking this Court to adhere 

to the specific written terms of the ERISA statute 

because those require a transfer to an alternate payee. 

That is our fundamental argument: A transfer to an 

alternate payee which is defined in 1056(d)(3)(K) as 

being someone --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sorry. Does this appear 

somewhere in the materials? It's always helpful.

 MR. FURLOW: Respondents' brief, Your Honor, 

and you will find it specifically on pages 14A and 15A,

in the appendix in the back. And if you actually go to 

the language, we stand on a plain-meaning interpretation 

of the ERISA statute, this reticulated and complicated 

statute. We say every word has its meaning.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you want me to 

read here?

 MR. FURLOW: Specifically, Your Honors, 

pages 14A and 15A of the Respondents' appendix, where he 

has actually given us all of the QDRO statute at 1056.

 And we say that has meaning, and that means 

we prevail because, if you look at that language, every 

subpart is talking about payments to alternate payees. 

"Alternate payees" are defined at 1056(d)(3)(K), and you 

will find that, Your Honors, specifically at page, at 

page 22A to 23A in the appendix.

 The alternate payees there that we are 

talking about are spouse, ex-spouse, child, or other 

dependent. It does not refer to the plan participant 

Mr. Kennedy; and, therefore, there was no -- his mere 

retention of his pension benefits and his wife's waiver 

of her contingent beneficiary payments, which would only 

come to her upon the death of William Kennedy, meant 

there was no transfer, not a dime's worth of money, not 

a bit of pension benefits transferred on the date that 

she signed that waiver. There was thus no --

JUSTICE ALITO: I'm not sure I'm getting 

this argument. There's not -- the argument isn't that 

there was a QDRO; the argument was that he could have 

disposed of this through a QDRO. And he could have done 

that, and he could have named an alternate payee in the 

QDRO. He could have named his daughter, for example.

 MR. FURLOW: Your Honor, the way pension 

planners understand it is that you use a QDRO for a 

transfer of benefits, not for a bare waiver. And that's 

where the U.S. Solicitor General supports our position 

and reads this and says that's consistent with 

Treasury's own, now harmonized with Labor's, 

interpretation of the anti-alienation clause. It does 

not apply to bare waivers of benefits, and, therefore, 

the Fifth Circuit erred in putting within a QDRO context 

his wife's --

JUSTICE ALITO: All you're saying is that 

you couldn't effect a bare waiver through a QDRO, but 

why does that prove your case? I don't understand that.

 MR. FURLOW: We think that --

JUSTICE ALITO: A QDRO could have been used 

to direct the payment to someone else other than the 

ex-spouse.

 MR. FURLOW: With respect to her waiver that 

would have required him in advance to decide who he

would have transferred what alternate payee he would 

transfer way back at the time of his divorce in 1994. 

He cannot. He did not transfer anything to his wife. 

She didn't receive anything at that time. She simply 

waived her contingent right to receive something upon 

her death, something that would occur in the future. 

She thoroughly waived that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not your point. It 

would seem to me your point is that the QDRO is an 

exception to the assignment or alienation.

 MR. FURLOW: I believe --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And your point is this has 

been no assignment or agency, so we don't need the QDRO 

exception. There is nothing in here that violates 

anything in the statute.

 MR. FURLOW: I completely agree with that 

analysis.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So whether he could have 

done a QDRO is in your view irrelevant. Your basic case 

is the QDRO is an exception from the prohibition on 

assignment or alienation, that provision has no 

application here, there has been no assignment or 

alienation, and therefore the waiver is effective.

 MR. FURLOW: That's exactly our position 

Your Honor, yes. So we find support in that and we find

support in not only Treasury's interpretation of its own 

regulation, which deserves great deference under this 

Court's opinion, especially when DuPont in the Fifth 

Circuit asserted that it was Department of Treasury that 

had all of the expertise pursuant to congressional 

mandate in determining how QDROs should apply and told 

the Fifth Circuit to follow their outdated 

interpretation of the QDRO statute. They certainly are 

not in a position to say that the expertise that they 

touted in the Fifth Circuit should be disregarded now, 

and we submit that the Attorney General and the 

Solicitor General are correct in saying that the 

regulation does not mean what DuPont says it does, but 

means what Kennedy says it does.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, of course you 

only think the Solicitor General is right so far to a 

certain extent.

 MR. FURLOW: To a certain extent.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then you throw them 

under the train because you don't -- you certainly don't 

think they are correct by saying, look, the only way you 

can do this is by modifying the plan. I still don't 

know how the plan administrator is supposed to know that 

the person whose name appears on the plan documents, 

which the plan participant can change at any time, isn't

the person that they are supposed to send the benefits 

to. Now, you tell me here they knew about the divorce 

and all that stuff. Maybe, maybe not. But we are 

trying to develop a rule for all cases and it seems to 

me the easiest, most administrable rule is to say 

whoever's name appears there gets the money, and if they 

are not supposed to because of some collateral dispute, 

well, they can sort that out in litigation. Maybe Kari 

has a suit against Mrs. Kennedy or her estate, but 

that's not a matter for the plan to worry about.

 MR. FURLOW: Well, Your Honor, let me 

address that. First, we don't throw the Solicitor 

General under the tracks. We simply point out the fact 

that they have gone off track in terms of their plan 

documents. And specifically, Your Honor, I would say I 

agree with the Manning versus, the Manning decision of 

the Texas, of the Fifth Circuit, which we cited. In 

there that says that sections 1102 and 1104 of ERISA are 

a very thin reed indeed to on which to cobble together a 

plan document's rule. And specifically DuPont then goes 

one bridge too far going way beyond that to say that 

these ever meetable ever changeable beneficiary changes 

thousands of them constitute documents where the Ninth 

Circuit conity substitutes of what constitutes plan 

documents in the salaried employees of Hughes versus

Hughes administrator case and said that a list of the 

participants and their addresses could not be considered 

a plan document because it did not correspond with that 

detailed listing of the plan document under Section 1024 

and 102 a. Indeed under Section 1025, Your Honors, if 

these are plan documents then the administrator has a 

duty to disclose them to any person participant or 

beneficiary who asked and as the Ninth Circuit pointed 

out there is substantial dangers there of going way 

beyond what Congress, a very liberal Watergate Congress 

in 1974, intended ERISA to be, which is a protection for 

participants and beneficiaries, not for plan 

administrators. And it exposes those participants and 

beneficiaries to loss of privacy, telemarketing, and 

other things because one person could get such a list 

and sell it to others.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I must have missed 

-- where did Watergate come from.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. FURLOW: Just putting in context the 

intentions of the 1974 Congress, which was concerned 

about participants and beneficiaries. Those were the 

sole purposes for which section 1102 was designed to 

protect, not the convenience of plan administrators as 

DuPont would lead this Court to believe.

 ORAL ARGUMENT BY LEONDRA R. KRUGER

 ON BEHALF OF AMICUS CURIAE

 MS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Fifth Circuit decided this case on the 

grounds that ERISA's anti-alienation provision forbids a 

divorcing spouse from relinquishing an interest in his 

or her ex-spouse's pension plan benefits unless the 

waiver takes the form of a qualified domestic relations 

order.

 We agree with Petitioner that the Fifth 

Circuit misinterpreted both the anti-alienation 

provision and the QDRO exception to that provision. But 

we disagree with Petitioner's further submission that 

merely because ERISA does not forbid waivers in the 

divorce context or otherwise, that a plan administrator 

may be required as a matter of Federal common law to 

recognize such waivers even when those waivers conflict 

with the beneficiary designation the plan administrator 

has on file.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, are the provisions

of page 49 of the appendix consistent with the statute?

 MS. KRUGER: Indeed, Your Honor, we think 

that they are. The statute directs plan administrators 

to administer the plan in accordance with the plan 

documents and further requires administrators to pay 

benefits to persons who are either participants under 

the plan or who are beneficiaries within the meaning of 

the statute.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the Court of Appeals 

give short shrift or overlook that point?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, the Court of Appeals 

determined that it need not reach this point because it 

decided the case on different grounds; namely, the 

anti-alienation grounds. But, again, we think that if 

the Fifth Circuit was incorrect in its reasoning but 

reached the correct overall conclusion, then its 

judgment should be affirmed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we -- I mean, we 

could have -- you know, we should have thought of that 

when we limited our -- our grant of certiorari to the --

to the one question on which you agree with the 

Petitioner. But we did do that, didn't we, even though 

the other one was -- was explicitly put under our nose, 

and we said we -- we are not going to get into that? We 

just want to decide this question, which is an important

question all by itself.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, for several reasons, Your 

Honor, we think it would be appropriate for the Court to 

answer both the plan documents question as well as the 

anti-alienation question.

 One is that it is an alternative ground for 

affirmance.

 The other is that it was properly raised in 

the Court of Appeals. It was raised in the cert 

petition as well as in the brief in opposition.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know any other case 

in which we have explicitly declined to accept a 

question and then have used one of these other back 

doorways of -- of answering it anyway?

 MS. KRUGER: I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know of any. I 

mean maybe -- maybe we have but --

MS. KRUGER: I'm -- I'm not sure that I know 

of any either, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, could we do this? I 

mean, what's bothering me about this is -- is you have a 

very strong argument following the plan documents. They 

have had some chance to reply to it, but not a full 

chance. It seems a little unfair, and the Fifth Circuit 

had -- would probably know what they say. Okay. Can

we, say, grant the question now and ask that people file 

an additional brief if they want to say something?

 It just seems to me an awful waste of money 

and everybody's time to send it back and have it make 

another trip. So what's your suggestion as to how we 

proceed?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, Your Honor, I think it 

would be possible to -- to either order for the briefing 

on the issue or to grant the question now at this 

juncture. I think it would also be conceivable to read 

the question that the Court did grant on as encompassing 

the Federal common law --

JUSTICE BREYER: You see, I want to be fair 

to them. I mean, we want -- you want to be fair to the 

other side to be sure they have a chance to say 

everything they have to say. That's what's worrying me.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, Your Honor, that is an 

important consideration. I do think that in the opening 

brief the Petitioners did brief the question of what 

effect is to be given to a waiver if indeed a waiver is 

not prohibited by the anti-alienation clause. And that 

Federal common law rule that Petitioners suggest is one 

that does, I think, naturally invite some consideration 

of the conflicting statutory directive in the form of 

the plan documents principle that this Court has

recognized in its earlier cases. And certainly in its 

reply brief Petitioners did address this issue in full.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did -- did we recognize in 

earlier cases that beneficiary designations are plan 

documents?

 MS. KRUGER: Well, Your Honor, I think the 

question of whether beneficiary designation forms, 

counsel plan documents, is a little bit beside the 

point. The -- the plan documents in this case do 

specify a procedure for determining who is to receive 

benefits. It says that benefits will be paid to the 

designated beneficiary, the person who is designated by 

the participant. And it says that changes to those 

beneficiary designations shall be made in the manner 

that's prescribed by the plan.

 And so, because the plan sets out a 

procedure for changing beneficiary designations, we 

think that it would be inappropriate to look beyond that 

to require plan administrators to look to extrinsic 

documents in order to determine whether one of them 

overrides that designation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Again, assuming there has 

been a change of beneficiary designation, and, of 

course, the argument you're confronted with is: I 

haven't changed anything. The prior beneficiary simply

-- simply refused to accept it, waived it. I haven't 

changed the designation at all.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, in this case there is a 

conflict then between the wishes of the participant, who 

by all accounts would have chosen not to change the 

beneficiary designation, and that of the beneficiary.

 And in that case in order to effectuate the 

-- the interests of all parties involved in order to 

provide certainty to all parties in ascertaining what 

their rights are with respect to the plan, then it is 

incumbent on the plan administrator to abide by the 

designated beneficiary.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think it's a harder 

question than you make it; and I, for one, have not gone 

into it as deeply as I would like to, principally 

because we rejected that -- that question.

 MS. KRUGER: Well, again, Your Honor, we 

think it would be appropriate for the Court to go on to 

address that question because the issues have been fully 

aired both in the Fifth Circuit and in the briefing in 

this Court. But if the Court were inclined to -- to 

reserve that question for a later time, I think that 

would be fine as well. And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Am I right in 

understanding that there is a fairly sharp circuit split

on that question, even that majority of the circuits are 

contrary to the Government's position?

 MS. KRUGER: That is correct. There is a 

circuit split on the question as was raised in the 

petition for certiorari, and the Second and Sixth 

Circuits are the circuits that have to date agreed with 

the position that we are espousing here: That the plan 

documents control and preclude formulation of a Federal 

common law rule of the sort that Petitioner proposes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And which circuits 

are on the other side?

 MS. KRUGER: There are a number of them 

including the Fifth, the Seventh, the Third.

 The reason why the plan documents rule is so 

important in this case is because it serves important 

statutory interests in certainty, certainty of the 

parties as well as certainty of the administrators.

 And it is clear; it is easy to apply; it 

makes it possible for administrators to do their jobs 

without fear of further litigation in case they happen 

to make what a court may later in the proceedings 

determine is the wrong choice.

 For that reason, we think that ERISA is 

clear, and that it doesn't permit the kind of Federal 

common law rule that Petitioner proposes, which is one

that would essentially revise the statute to override 

the plan documents rule and would require substantial 

burdens on the plan and would yield uncertainty for the 

parties.

 For that reason we would ask the Court to 

affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on 

alternative grounds or, alternatively, it should remand 

for further proceedings.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT BY MARK I. LEVY

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. LEVY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In light of the Court's questions, I want to 

begin with the plan documents argument and first the 

procedural question of whether it's properly before the 

Court. We think that it is.

 It's well within the settled doctrine of an 

alternative ground for affirmance. It was raised below, 

and the Fifth Circuit has decided the issue in other 

cases. We don't dispute that. So we know what the 

Fifth Circuit thinks about this issue, and, therefore, 

there is no point in a remand.

which we've done this --

MR. LEVY: I do.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- rejected the question 

and then decided it?

 MR. LEVY: I apologize if it's not in the 

brief, but a case I could find was called Piper Aircraft 

versus Rayno 454 U.S. 235. And in that case the court 

limited its grant of certiorari, but then went ahead and 

decided a question that wasn't subsumed within that 

question because they found it appropriate to the proper 

disposition of the case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. But is that 

a case in which the question the court decided was 

presented in the petition, the court said we are not 

going to take that question then they decided it on that 

ground anyway.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I'm asking. 

Yes.

 MR. LEVY: I'm not sure of the answer to 

that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You are sure of the answer. 

You don't know of any case.

 MR. LEVY: I think Piper is at least a first 

cousin if not a direct sibling of the issue that we've

discretion. The Court has discretion, I think, one --

either way whether it wants to decide this or wants 

remand, but we think it would be appropriate --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess you agree 

that it's a question of which the circuits have split, 

so presumably there are good arguments on both sides, 

and it's one that your friend hasn't had a full 

opportunity to brief here. So we'd have to be pretty 

confident of the answer, I think, to go ahead and decide 

it.

 MR. LEVY: Well, actually I think the Court 

will be confident if it looks into it. But beyond that 

this is the classic case of an alternative ground for 

affirmance of the judgment. When that arises, the 

topside party always has to deal with that issue in its 

reply brief and only in its reply brief. So there is 

nothing unfair about the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It would be the classic 

case but for the fact that we had rejected that 

question. Had we not been asked to decide it and said 

no, it would be the classic case, I agree.

 MR. LEVY: And I agree. That makes it 

within the Court's discretion. It doesn't have to 

decide it, but we think there are good reasons here.

the reason I just said. Four amici have addressed it; 

we have addressed it. So it's properly before the 

Court, and there is nothing unfair about deciding it. 

In addition --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can we expect that to 

happen in future cases when we turn down a question and 

amici and people come in and brief the question anyway 

and then ask us to decide it?

 MR. LEVY: I wouldn't think so. The fact 

that we can't find another case, either, I think makes 

this one unique. And I think there are good reasons --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think there is a 

question of the way it was phrased. And perhaps the 

court just didn't get it, what that question on which we 

didn't grant cert was driving at.

 MR. LEVY: I would be loathe to make that 

suggestion, Justice Ginsburg.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. LEVY: But it may well -- it's possible 

that that could be the explanation or the Court with 

fuller consideration -- I mean, the issue has been fully 

briefed. The Court knows more about the issues than it 

did at the time it granted cert, and we think it is for 

a -- to decide this.

relationship between the questions. Both the question 

granted and the question that wasn't granted -- wasn't 

denied, but it wasn't granted -- raise similar 

considerations. They both get into the same statutory 

scheme. They both get into the same considerations of 

plan administrability. We think it would be most 

efficient for the Court to resolve the conflict now and 

not leave the uncertainty to continue any further.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Undoubtedly we should have 

granted it.

 MR. LEVY: Well, in the fullness of time, 

the Court can now revisit that. But again, I think it 

has been fully briefed and there is nothing unfair to 

the Petitioners. The Court in its discretion --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you like to argue 

the question that is here?

 MR. LEVY: Yes --

(Laughter.)

 MR. LEVY: -- I would. I take it the Court 

doesn't need argument on the merits of the plan 

documents issues, since that's already been discussed, 

so let me turn to the QDRO question. That is the 

question that was -- that was granted and was discussed 

fully in the briefs.

rule of law that governs this case is that pension plan 

administrators must pay benefits in accordance with a 

qualified domestic relations order, and they may not pay 

benefits in accordance with a nonqualified order.

 That rule follows from two separate and 

different analyses. One is the anti-alienation 

provision, and the other is the QDRO provision in 

subparagraph (H) of section 1056. They are both 

discussed in our brief.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where would I find the 

latter? If I wanted to read it? Which I do.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. LEVY: I don't find this all that 

pleasant reading, but it's on page 21A of the statutory 

appendix to the red brief.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 21A?

 MR. LEVY: 21A. And it's (H)(ii) and (iii). 

And I want to start with this because it is really is 

the more straightforward analysis and avoids a lot of 

questions under the anti-alienation provision. This 

argument would prevail whether or not the purported 

waiver is deemed to be an assignment or alienation under 

1056(d)(1) and (d)(3).

 Now, we think it is and I'll come back to 

that under the IRS regulation, but let me start with

this alternative argument that's also made in the brief.

 Under ERISA, a domestic relations order is 

either a qualified order or a nonqualified order. And 

ERISA expressly provides that if it's a nonqualified 

order, as it is here, the plan administrator may not pay 

benefits pursuant to that order.

 Justice Scalia, since you're on page 21A, 

let's look at subparagraph (H)(iii). This is 21A of the 

red brief. It provides that: If an order is not 

qualified, the plan administrator shall pay the benefits 

to the person or persons who would be entitled to such 

benefits if there had been no order. If there had been 

no order. In other words, the administrator disregards 

it and pays it to the person -- this is in (iii), 

Justice Scalia.

 Contrast that with subparagraph (H)(ii) 

right above it, where the order is qualified: The 

administrator shall pay the benefits to the person 

entitled thereto under the order.

 So, it gives you two choices. If it's a 

qualified order, the plan must pay. If it's not a 

qualified order, the plan --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that doesn't make too 

much sense, does it, where all that happens is it's just 

waived. The wife waived the amount because when she

waived the amount, she doesn't give it to anybody. She 

just doesn't take it. So it goes to the beneficiary --

it goes to the person who made up the plan. It's a 

little hard to pay to him, because he is dead.

 So I mean if you read it literally, it 

doesn't seem to apply, these (ii) and (iii), to the case 

before us, which is a case of waiver. And of course the 

argument, yes, she makes is that throughout the law, 

waiver is treated differently. And if it weren't, you'd 

have to pay gift tax, for example, when you waive a 

benefit that's given to you by someone else.

 And so let's interpret this and make sense 

of the language you quoted, and consistent with the rest 

of the law to say a waiver is waivered. It's not giving 

something to somebody else.

 MR. LEVY: You've covered a lot of ground, 

Justice Breyer. I want to give you several responses --

JUSTICE BREYER: The argument is against you 

and I would like to hear what you have to say.

 MR. LEVY: And I appreciate that.

 First of all, on this part of the argument 

under the QDRO provision under subparagraph (H), it 

doesn't matter whether this is a waiver or not. That 

goes to the alienation question, and I will get to that 

in a little while. This applies --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, it also goes to the 

question of who is the person or persons who would have 

been entitled to such amounts if there had been no 

order.

 MR. LEVY: If there were no --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If there was a waiver and 

there had been no order, your friend's contention is by 

traditional common law, the person who would have been 

entitled to it would have been his client.

 MR. LEVY: On the contrary, Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I don't see how 

this language helps you. It sort of restates the 

question, but --

MR. LEVY: I don't believe so. I think it 

is not only helpful but dispositive. The order that is 

referred to is the divorce decree, the qualified 

domestic -- I'm sorry -- the domestic relations order.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. LEVY: If there had been no order --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If there had been no 

order --

MR. LEVY: -- then there wouldn't have been 

any waiver by Liv. I mean, excuse me -- yes, by Liv. 

There wouldn't have been any waiver if there weren't any 

divorce decree because the waiver is contained --

were no --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I see your point. Does he 

agree with that, that apart from the divorce decree, 

there is no waiver?

 MR. LEVY: I'd hesitate to speak for him, 

but I think the language is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I got you.

 MR. LEVY: -- quite clear, and that's why 

this is a more straightforward analysis than the waiver 

under anti-alienation. I do hope to get to that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I see.

 MR. LEVY: But this is really very 

straightforward and dispositive.

 And the legislative history confirms this. 

The plain text is clear, but the legislative history 

confirms it. Congress took a specific look at this 

specific issue in a specific context of marital 

dissolution, and it enacted this QDRO provision. And 

the provision is comprehensive and complete.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm -- I didn't follow, I'd 

have to admit. I think -- and you perhaps can explain 

it to me -- but, I thought the things that you are 

quoting are QDRO is about an effort to alienate some

property that would otherwise go to the person who was 

setting up a QDRO, in other words, the wife here, in 

other words Liv here; is that right?

 MR. LEVY: No. It has to go to an alternate 

payee. It doesn't have to be the wife.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. The one person who 

couldn't be an alternate payee is the payor. And so, in 

fact, when you waive something, it isn't that it 

necessarily goes back to some alternate payee, as it 

didn't here. It simply went back to the payor. And so 

the language of this prevision you're quoting just 

doesn't deal with this case.

 MR. LEVY: Well, I think it does, Justice 

Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I know you do, and that's 

what I need to ask.

 MR. LEVY: It doesn't say anything about 

where it goes. It just says if it's a QDRO, you pay it, 

and if it's not a QDRO, you don't pay it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sorry. It says, if 

it's not, the issue to wit is not resolved, then the 

plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts to 

the person or persons who would have been entitled to 

such amounts if there had been no order.

 MR. LEVY: Yes.

includes the giver, the payor?

 MR. LEVY: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's where this 

goes if you waive it.

 MR. LEVY: I don't believe so, because the 

"if there had no order" clause refers to the domestic 

relations order, a divorce decree.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You say the waiver is in 

the order?

 MR. LEVY: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And without the order, 

there has been no waiver.

 MR. LEVY: That's correct. And the statute 

says --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We'll have to see whether 

your friend agrees with that. I'll bet he doesn't.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. LEVY: That's what made horse races. 

Let me just say a further word about the legislative 

history of this and then come back to the 

anti-alienation provision, Justice Breyer, if I -- if I 

might.

 Congress made it clear that benefits are to 

be paid pursuant to an order "if and only if" -- and

that's a quote from the legislative history -- the order 

is a QDRO; in other words, the order be a QDRO in order 

to be paid. Congress was mindful of the burdens that 

nonqualified orders put on plan administrators and it 

purposely sought to avoid that by requiring that an 

order be a QDRO, a qualified order, in order for there 

-- for there to be payment. The QDRO provision is an 

objective checklist that is easy for -- for plan 

administrators to follow.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if they had agreed to 

the waiver apart from -- apart from the -- from the 

domestic relations order? Just apart from that, they 

have a separate signed waiver. We'd be in the same suit 

that you're -- that you say we have to avoid, wouldn't 

we?

 MR. LEVY: I don't think so. I mean I think 

that would be an alienation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if it's an 

alienation, but his point is that a waiver is not an 

alienation.

 MR. LEVY: Right. And I will come to that, 

but the point here is that this arises and can only 

arise in a domestic relations context. That's where 

QDRO applies, and the Fifth Circuit's holding was that 

that was the sole mechanism for the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What about some other 

waiver that's -- that's not in connection with a -- with 

a domestic relations thing?  You know -- "I've made my 

-- my eldest son a beneficiary." It turns out, you 

know, he is fat and happy; he doesn't need the money and 

he agrees to waive it, so -- so I can give it to an 

impecunious daughter. Okay? What -- what happens with 

that?

 MR. LEVY: Well, first of all, that would 

run squarely into the plan document's argument.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ah. Oh, oh, oh. You're 

jumping over to the other argument. Let's leave that 

argument out.

 MR. LEVY: If it's not a marital dissolution 

context, then QDRO wouldn't apply one way or the other. 

Now, in that context, I think what you're suggesting, 

Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but you would still --

the plan would still have to make some inquires, 

wouldn't it?

 MR. LEVY: Not -- well, just on -- not

mean, this case involves what Congress specifically 

looked at and specifically did in the context of marital 

dissolution, and the reason for that is a marital 

dissolution comes up all the time.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.

 MR. LEVY: It's a commonplace in these 

benefits issues, and these are high-volumes operations. 

The plan administrators aren't lawyers. Congress wanted 

bright-line rules that could be easily applied here, not 

general principles to be applied for the facts and 

circumstances of each particular case, highly 

fact-intensive, highly subjective inquiries. Congress 

didn't want any of that. It didn't want the plan 

administrator to have to look behind the face of the 

order to the circumstances of the --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm five minutes behind. I 

just got your point on the (iii)(1). I see it.

 MR. LEVY: Okay.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay? I get it.

 MR. LEVY: It didn't want the plan 

administrators to have to try and divine the intention 

of the parties, didn't want the plan administrators to 

have to hold a factfinding hearing before it could pay 

plan benefits. That is completely foreign to the 

efficient and simple operation that Congress had in

mind.

 Now let me turn to the anti-alienation issue 

about which there have been several questions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you do, leaving 

the plan -- the beneficiary designation, you say that 

the plan administrator is not required to give effect to 

a waiver that conflicts with the beneficiary 

designation. Is it just not required? Does the 

administrator have discretion to give effect to the 

waiver, or it -- must it disregard the waiver and 

strictly follow the beneficiary designation?

 MR. LEVY: I believe it must follow the 

beneficiary designation. Indeed, my understanding is it 

has a fiduciary duty and a legal requirement to follow 

the plan designation. Now, the plan might specify 

alternatives. Here, for example, the plan said, here's 

a form that you fill out. And William Kennedy filled it 

out with respect to a different plan, the pension and 

retirement plan. But where the plan says, "we will pay 

the designated beneficiary" -- and that's what this plan 

says -- then the plan administrator is required, as I 

understand it, to pay that designated beneficiary.

 Now let me say a word since this came up, 

although it's not really central to the change of 

beneficiary designation that William filed for this

other plan that's not now before the Court, the pension 

and retirement plan. And I would say only two things 

about that: One is at JA 62, and if you look at it, it 

says in the title and it says in the body of the 

document that this applies to the pension and retirement 

plan. We don't think anyone could have thought that it 

applied to other plans and that William therefore was 

changing the beneficiary as to those other plans. In 

fact, at JA 28 in paragraph 10, there was a stipulation 

of fact in the district court that William never changed 

the designation as to the savings and investment plan, 

the SIP that is before the Court today. So it was not 

only not raised below, it was stipulated away and I 

think that was --

JUSTICE BREYER: Let me go back for a second 

because, while I got it five minutes late, if I have it 

right, I still don't see why Congress would have done it 

literally.

 I think what you're saying is: "Read the 

full four pages. What those four pages say are, Judge, 

you have an order, a divorce decree. It's defined as an 

order. Look at it. It's qualified or it isn't. If 

it's qualified, pay the money to the person it names. 

If it's not qualified, pay the money to the person, 

namely Liv, who would have been entitled to the amount

if there had been no order."

 Okay. You read that literally as you want 

and what it says is: "Liv, you're being divorced. You 

want a divorce; your husband wants a divorce; you're 

going to be divorced. You cannot waive the benefit 

under the plan." Now, why would Congress not want her 

to be able to waive it? Why?

 MR. LEVY: I don't think the issue -- I 

mean, a lot depends on the wording.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I can understand an anti-

alienation provision. That's some guy who is going to 

come along and grab this money when you want to take 

care of a widow, and you want to take care -- but -- but 

this isn't that. It's just -- she just wants to waive 

it; she doesn't want it. That's the widow herself. 

Okay, so why would Congress --

MR. LEVY: Two things: One, we think that 

purpose does apply here. I mean, the point of 

anti-alienation provision is to guard against the 

temptation to trade off future pension benefits in 

exchange for immediate economic gain or advantage. 

That's exactly what Liv did in the divorce. She got the 

Mercedes, she got other things. She traded off her 

pension benefits, and we think that falls squarely 

within the purpose of the anti-alienation provision.

JUSTICE BREYER: I see.

 MR. LEVY: That's the first and, I think, 

most important answer.

 The other thing is that we are not saying --

our position today does not mean that divorcing parties 

can -- can be foreclosed from eliminating the death 

benefits -- the death benefits for the designated 

beneficiary; but they have to follow procedures that 

comply with ERISA. The most -- the most direct and 

simplest one is the change of beneficiary form. William 

didn't do that here. That's undisputed. They could 

have entered into a QDRO, and that would have gone --

the money would have gone to Liv as an alternate payee. 

That would have taken the benefits, consistent with 

ERISA, away from Liv and given them to Kari. They could 

have done that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why -- why do 

they have to worry about that? The simplest thing is 

for the participant to change the designation, and if 

there's a divorce, the divorcee is no longer a spouse 

under the terms of the plan, so he is free to do that. 

It seems odd to me that they have this elaborate QDRO 

provision when it shouldn't be necessary.

 MR. LEVY: It's not necessary. It's simply 

another alternative, but I agree with you, Mr. Chief

Justice, that the most direct and straightforward --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But another 

alternative is that all you can -- you can cross out 

this name and put in another, or you can go to court, 

get this, qualify it as a QDRO, file it with the plan. 

I mean, why would anybody do that?

 MR. LEVY: They wouldn't have to.

 Now, let me turn to this issue about what is 

an assignment or alienation when we disagree with our 

friends from the Solicitor General's Office. We think 

Liv's purported waiver here was an assignment or 

alienation within the IRS definition. The IRS 

regulation is reprinted at page 15 of the body of the 

red brief, and it provides that assignment or alienation 

is defined to include any direct or indirect arrangement 

whereby a party acquires an interest from the 

beneficiary. And I've left out the not -- the 

not-critical language for present purposes. So it talks 

about an indirect arrangement whereby a party acquires 

an interest from the beneficiary.

 Now, the government argues that that 

definition requires that the beneficiary, first, must 

direct the transfer and, second, it must direct it to a 

third party. The government's argument rests not on the 

language of the regulation that I just read but on a

legal argument that this is what terms meant at common 

law. But that position simply can't be squared with the 

language of the regulation. As I just said, the 

regulation includes an indirect arrangement within the 

definition of "assignment or alienation."

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't -- isn't the 

problem that it must be an indirect arrangement, and 

what you are arguing for here is an indirect effect. 

And it has that indirect effect on your reasoning 

because of the -- of the waiver and because of probate 

law. And it seems to me, as I read the -- the IRS reg, 

the "arrangement" that it's referring to is an 

arrangement which in and of itself would -- would effect 

the transfer. And that is not the case here.

 MR. LEVY: Well, we think it is. The 

arrangement here effected transfer to the estate under 

the plan default rule. The estate was next in line. So 

if this is a relinquishment -- I don't want to use the 

word "waiver." But if this is a relinquishment of her 

interest, then it went to the estate.

 That's what the plan provides, but it's not 

just the phrase "indirect arrangement" that we rely on, 

Justice Souter. It's also the phrase "a party 

acquirer." It doesn't say a party acquirer at or by the 

direction of the beneficiary. -

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's -- that's the 

point that troubles me. It's -- it's the "acquirer's" 

language.

 Does -- does the person who -- who receives 

the -- the refused benefit acquire it from the other 

person? He certainly doesn't do so for Federal tax 

purposes.

 MR. LEVY: Well, that's back to the 

disclaimer, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The only person who 

acquires it -- the only entity that acquires it is the 

estate.

 MR. LEVY: Yes, that's right under the 

default rule. And if the default rule had a -- if the 

plan had a different default rule, under the default 

rule maybe it goes to the children.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does he acquire it from a 

participant or beneficiary?

 MR. LEVY: He acquires it from the 

beneficiary list.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the -- the notion 

is it's as though the -- it's as though the devise to 

the person refusing it had never occurred. I mean, 

there is -- there is no gift tax payable or anything 

else.

MR. LEVY: Well, there is no gift tax 

payable if it's a qualified disclaimer, and it won't be 

in a divorce case because there will be consideration 

and that prevents a qualified disclaimer. So that's a 

different situation, but the word "acquired" doesn't 

mean --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You made the contention 

now -- and I think you have it in your brief -- that if 

you get something in return for a disclaimer, then the 

disclaimer is not effected. That it's effected only if 

you receive nothing in return. And what -- what is the 

source of that contention that you can't disclaim if you 

get something in return?

 MR. LEVY: The -- it's -- under the Gift Tax 

Code Justice Ginsburg, section 2518 defines a qualified 

disclaimer, which means you don't pay gift tax on it. 

It's as if the interest had never been transferred. And 

one of the conditions of that qualified disclaimer is 

that the disclaimant not accept any interest or any of 

its benefits. So if there is consideration, if the 

person is in a better position than they would have been 

because they received consideration, then it won't be a 

qualified disclaimer for gift tax purposes.

 But there won't ever be a disqualified 

disclaimer for that reason in a -- in the divorce

context. It simply --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is the -- is the wife --

I'm thinking of the Chief Justice's question, too. If 

your -- the woman is Wife X, and her ex has a pension. 

Doesn't something vest there? She is in California. 

Doesn't she have some vested right to some of that 

pension?

 MR. LEVY: In her own pension?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose she's married for 

40 years to Joe Smith, Joe Smith earns a pension and 

then he wants a divorce. Doesn't she have some right to 

some of that money.

 MR. LEVY: Well, I think under section 1055 

there's a right to different annuities. That that was a 

new provision in the Retirement Equity Act in 1984.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Does she get some of the 

money he saved?

 MR. LEVY: Yes, she's entitled to it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So it's not exactly that 

you could have just changed the beneficiary. If you 

just changed the beneficiary, you'd have to give her 

something else.

 MR. LEVY: After the divorce she is not 

entitled. It's only a spouse who is entitled to the 

benefits .

I mean it depends what the divorce is.  She got the 

Mercedes, right? I mean, she can get -- it depends on 

the divorce arrangement, not anything under ERISA, once 

she is a nonspouse.

 MR. LEVY: Once she is a nonspouse she is no 

longer entitled to those benefits under ERISA section 

1055.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Furlow, you have three minutes 

remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY DAVID A. FURLOW

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. FURLOW: Thank you, Your Honor. Chief 

Justice Roberts, you were asking about the evidence 

earlier with respect to the possession in DuPont office 

own files of the divorce decree and of the notice that 

was given saying: Please don't pay leave; she's already 

waived all of her benefits. You will find that on page

Official - Subject to Final Review 

76 of the joint appendix in the sworn amended affidavit 

of Mary Dineen, the plan's administrator, specifically 

at paragraph 20, page 76, where she says in bold: "Upon 

its receipt" -- meaning the April 26, 2001, letter from 

Kari Kennedy Duckworth -- "Exhibit No. 1 was maintained 

as a record of DuPont with regard to the SIP account of 

William Patrick Kennedy." That's joint appendix 76, 

paragraph 20. It was within the regular course of 

business of DuPont to maintain a copy of this letter 

with other DuPont letters relating to Mr. Kennedy's SIP 

account at the time the letter was received from its 

sender. The letter is then attached as the next exhibit 

that follows on. That would be about pages 78 to 79. 

And there it says the divorce decree was attached.

 Make no mistake: DuPont had that divorce 

decree and could see the knowing, voluntary waiver and 

had it well in advance of making its decision to pay 

money to a woman who went off to Norway and paid her 

when she was over there, where there was no prospect of 

grabbing it back and turning it over to the executor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They look at it and 

say, is this a QDRO? And if no, then they go back to 

the other provision, I guess on page 21a in the red 

brief, and say: If it's not a QDRO, ignore it.

 MR. FURLOW: Well, Your Honor, it's more

interesting than that, actually, in that if you look to 

page 68 of the joint appendix you'll see Mary Dineen, 

the administrator, was saying, quote: "Had Liv Kennedy 

disclaimed her designation of the beneficiary of 

Mr. Kennedy's SIP, that declination or disclaimer or a 

copy would have been included in the beneficiary 

designation file." So they're taking disclaimers or 

waivers. They're taking declinations, which is a fancy 

Latin way of saying waiver. They've got them in their 

files. They're acting on it. But here they decided to 

pay the money to the person who has voluntarily waived, 

knowing the issue, not asking their in-house counsel at 

no cost to make an examination here. And why? So that 

they can later take this plan documents rule and take it 

all the way to this court. But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Was this waiver only part 

of the divorce degree? Do you agree with your friend on 

that point?

 MR. FURLOW: Well, this waiver was the part 

in which Liv Kennedy waived all right so that he 

retained all of his --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not separate and 

apart from the divorce decree.

 MR. FURLOW: It was not separate and apart. 

In fact, when they were transferring benefits they knew

what to do and they used the waiver to transfer part of 

the benefits.

 It is interesting, Your Honors, that they 

talked about the plan documents rule, but their own 

documentation says, their own plan says, that the only 

plan documents -- and I quoted it here on page 25 of our 

reply brief -- "The official plan documents are the E.I. 

DuPont de Nemours & Company savings and investment plan 

and the trust agreement," not beneficiary designations. 

So they give no notice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have anything 

more to say on the plan document, the plan document 

issue than what you've said here.

 MR. FURLOW: Oh, I could come up with lots 

of things. That's a bad idea.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Thank you, 

counsel. The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 1:56 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
