 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in Case 07-513 , Herring v. United States.

 Miss Karlan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MS. KARLAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice 

and may it please the Court:

 In February 2004, the Dale County circuit 

clerk told the local sheriff's department that the court 

was recalling a warrant that had been issued earlier for 

Petitioner's arrest. Having received that notice, 

someone in the sheriff's department physically removed 

the warrant from the file and physically took the 

warrant back to the court clerk's office. But no one 

either then or later in the sheriff's department ever 

updated the computer file to indicate that the record 

had -- that the warrant had been recalled. As a result 

of that police department error, the Petitioner in this 

case was subject to a warrantless arrest for which there 

was no probable cause five months later.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Didn't they have 

some regular system for updating the computer base? I 

mean, I assume it was updated at some point.

MS. KARLAN: No. Your Honor. There was 

no -- there's nothing in the record to suggest that this 

department ever does, for example, what the FBI does, 

which is to conduct periodic audits. Had they conducted 

one, they would have discovered almost instantly what 

they discovered five months later, which was there was 

no warrant in this case. So this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So people who are, 

you know, the warrant is served, they're arrested, they 

go to trial, they're in jail, their name still shows up 

as having a warrant out for their arrest.

 MS. KARLAN: We don't know, Mr. Chief 

Justice, because this is a department that as far as the 

record reflects conducts no audits of any kind to update 

its files. And if you look at page 41 and page 60 of 

the joint appendix, one of the things you'll discover 

about this department is that everyone in the department 

has access to the physical place warrants are kept. 

They're kept in several different places in the office.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well then, how did 

this warrant clerk, I guess is what I'd call her, 

discover the error? She discovered it within 10 or 15 

minutes, right.

 MS. KARLAN: She discovered it because what 

happened is a clerk in another police department called

and said, is there a warrant for Petitioner's arrest. 

She looked at the computer list on her computer and said 

yes. Then this other warrant clerk said, please fax us 

a physical copy of the warrant.  So she went to the file 

where the warrant should have been. It wasn't there. 

She went to another file. The warrant wasn't there. 

She then called the court clerk's office and discovered 

that they had recalled the warrant which was back in 

their records five months earlier.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why did the first --

first person in that scenario need a physical copy of 

the warrant?

 MS. KARLAN: The record doesn't reflect 

that, but she simply I guess wanted to verify that there 

actually was a warrant because they were picking 

Petitioner up in a different county.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Does your argument depend on 

the quality of the recordkeeping in this particular 

department? I thought your argument would apply even if 

this department had excellent recordkeeping procedures 

but nevertheless made a mistake in this instance.

 MS. KARLAN: That's correct, Justice Alito. 

Our view is, just as is true with respect to probable 

cause, the fact that 99 percent of a department's 

arrests are with probable cause doesn't mean that when

they arrest someone without probable cause you say, 

well, you get one bite at the apple or a sort of "good 

enough for government work" theory.

 JUSTICE ALITO: You're not asking for 

Arizona v. Evans to be overruled are you.

 MS. KARLAN: No. We're asking to you apply 

Arizona v. Evans. And if I could give an answer to the 

question the Chief Justice was asking earlier that comes 

from Arizona v. Evans, what happened in Arizona v. Evans 

-- and Justice Stevens mentions this in his dissent 

there -- is the clerk discovered there, the court clerk 

discovered, that the warrant that had been, that she had 

verified, had in fact been recalled. And so what they 

instantly did is they checked their files, and they 

discovered four other warrants from that same day that 

had been recalled but that were still in their files.

 Here we didn't have anything done after they 

discovered the error. They discovered this error and, 

as they say, have gone on their merry way. There's 

nothing in this record --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there was 

something done in this particular case, though, right? 

The warrant clerk notified -- was it the Coffee County 

people?

 MS. KARLAN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that the warrant 

-- that the information she had given 10 minutes before 

was inaccurate.

 MS. KARLAN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. And 

that indicates part of what we're concerned about here, 

which is this is a department that was built for speed, 

not for accuracy.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But none of that matters for 

your argument, does it?

 MS. KARLAN: Oh, no.

 JUSTICE ALITO: You want to make it -- you 

want to draw a clear line between errors by -- by 

clerical court employees versus errors by police 

employees.

 MS. KARLAN: That's correct. We think 

that's the most workable argument, because what we want 

is a system in which suppression hearings can be 

conducted expeditiously based on the facts of particular 

cases.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How expeditious would it be 

-- suppose there's negligence on the part of both a 

court employee and a police department employee. What 

is the judge supposed to do in deciding the suppression 

motion? Is this a comparative negligence determination.

 MS. KARLAN: I don't think it would be

exactly a comparative negligence determination. I think 

it -- that raises a difficult question and the way I 

would approach that question is to perhaps use some of 

what Justice Kennedy talked about in Hudson as a 

causation approach. That is, if but for the negligence 

of the police department there would have been --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought negligence is 

irrelevant here. I think if the police department was 

wrong, even if they had been very careful but for some 

reason or other they made a mistake -- so you're arguing 

for shear causality, not for negligence. If negligence 

made the difference then we'd have to go into these 

factors that you say are very difficult to calculate.

 MS. KARLAN: Well, Justice Scalia, I was 

answering Justice Alito's question and if I could just 

give a little bit of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I know you were answering 

his question, but you want to answer it in a way that's 

consistent with your argument here.

 MS. KARLAN: Well, it is, Justice Scalia. 

So let me explain why it's consistent, which is our 

position is if police department error causes an 

unconstitutional arrest then you should suppress 

evidence, but if both the police were negligent and the 

clerk was negligence and the police department's

negligence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You've injected the word 

"negligence."

 MS. KARLAN: Okay, let me take the word 

"negligence" out then. If the police error didn't cause 

the discovery of the evidence --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Alone, but --

MS. KARLAN: -- that's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- there is dual 

causality.

 MS. KARLAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't a matter of simple 

negligence.

 MS. KARLAN: No, that's correct. That's 

correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is it going to 

keep --

JUSTICE ALITO: How are -- how are you going 

to determine whether there's error without determining 

whether there's negligence? Suppose the court clerk 

calls up the police department and says the warrant is 

still outstanding, and in fact it's not. And it sends 

them over a physical copy of a warrant, but that warrant 

has been withdrawn. Now, the police could always take 

additional steps: They could send someone over to check

the records, to look at the court docket to make sure 

that the warrant had not been withdrawn. So there would 

be causality, but it would not determine what they 

should --

MS. KARLAN: There would be no police error 

there.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- what their duty was. 

How are you going to determine where this error should 

be -- should be assigned?

 MS. KARLAN: Because in that case there 

would be no police error. What this Court held in Evans 

is that police departments are entitled to rely on the 

representations of court clerks that there are warrants. 

So if the court clerk erroneously sends a warrant over, 

the police are not required to look behind that warrant, 

just as they're not required in Evans.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Let me give you another 

example. Suppose that the court clerk calls up and says 

-- it leaves a message, gives a message to somebody in 

the police department. And they memorialize that, and 

they say "called up." And let's say the warrant number 

is the same as the docket number of this case. So the 

court employee says -- writes down "Called up," says, 

"Warrant quashed in warrant, in case 07-513." The court 

-- the police department has a record of the call, and

they say, "Received call from court clerk. Warrant to 

be quashed. Warrant quashed in case 07-531." And so 

the 513 is not quashed; the person is arrested. Now, 

who caused that? You have to have a hearing?

 MS. KARLAN: The police -- the police 

department person caused that by writing down the wrong 

number.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How do you know that the 

police department wrote down the wrong number?

 MS. KARLAN: Well, it's the same question as 

JUSTICE ALITO: How do you know what number 

was --

MS. KARLAN: Well, it's the same question as 

in Evans: How do we know who made the mistake? That 

question, just like the question -- is a question on 

which you're going to have to hold a hearing because 

Evans says if it was court error, there is no 

suppression; and our position is, if it was police 

error, there is. But that's a very manageable hearing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just so I have your theory 

firmly in mind, you would say there is police error even 

if what happened was that there was an unpredictable and 

unavoidable computer glitch, no negligence on anybody's 

part? The computer simply malfunctioned, got it wrong.

It wasn't negligence. You would still say that that is 

police error, and you would say that that counts against 

the admission of --

MS. KARLAN: That's correct. As long as 

it's police error, it counts against the police.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why, if there is no 

negligence? Why do you need to argue that and why do 

you argue that? I mean doesn't there have to be at 

least negligence on somebody's part?

 MS. KARLAN: Well, here's the problem: 

There are two kinds of negligence you might have; that 

is, you might have the negligence of an individual 

employee, or what you might have is a decision to use a 

shoddy recordkeeping system that doesn't catch those 

errors. So the question is --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, either of those 

things are negligence or worse.

 MS. KARLAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So what I didn't understand 

is why you would charge the police with anything or 

suppress a warrant where there was a mistake but no one 

was negligent or worse.

 MS. KARLAN: Well, we have had some 

difficulty finding any reported cases in which there is 

a police error of the kind of computer glitch that was

just hypothesized. That is where the machines --

JUSTICE BREYER: But what you argued for --

MS. KARLAN: Yes. What --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- you said, it should be 

suppressed even if no one is negligent or worse. And I 

have trouble seeing why you're suppressing a warrant 

where no one does anything wrong at all.

 MS. KARLAN: Well, part of what I'm trying 

to get at in my answer to your question is it's unclear 

in that situation whether anyone has done something 

wrong; that is, whether somebody in the police 

department programmed the police department computer --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's just assume the 

hypothetical -- the hypothetical: The computer 

malfunctions.

 MS. KARLAN: Well, you could have an act of 

God exception to exclusionary rule, if you wanted to, 

but this case doesn't ask you to do that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm sure a computer might 

be compared to God, but let's --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Could I ask this question 

MS. KARLAN: It's more powerful sometimes.

You're saying that the question is whether anybody did 

anything wrong at all. This is not undisputed, that 

this person was illegally arrested? The arrest itself 

violated the Fourth Amendment.

 MS. KARLAN: There is no question that as a 

matter of fact --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The question is whether it 

can be justified.

 MS. KARLAN: Yes. This was a warrantless 

arrest without probable cause. And the question is: 

Does the government have some sort of affirmative 

defense as to why it should be allowed to use this? 

Now, in Evans --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a separate 

question. It may be an illegal arrest, but the question 

is the separate one of whether or not you exclude the 

evidence collected incident to that arrest. And we 

have, in several cases, separated the two questions, and 

I guess it's difficult for me to see if no one has done 

anything wrong, no one, why you would suppress the 

evidence in that case.

 MS. KARLAN: Well, that case of course is 

not this case, and you might want to leave open the 

question of the --

this difficulty: Do we have to get into negligence, or 

should we assume, as I understand to be your theory, as 

Justice Breyer put it, that you would still suppress the 

evidence when no one has done anything wrong?

 MS. KARLAN: We are asking in this case for 

you to suppress when someone has done something wrong.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But how do you know? How 

do you know? That's the problem.

 MS. KARLAN: Well, we do know that someone 

did something wrong here, because we know --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we want an answer --

MS. KARLAN: No, I'm trying to answer --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: We want an answer to the 

question.

 MS. KARLAN: No, I'm trying --

anything wrong.

that question.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- because this bears on 

the fact of why are we doing this at all.

 MS. KARLAN: No. I'm trying to answer that 

question, and the point I wanted to make is: This case 

asks for a narrow rule, but the question that you may 

also want to be thinking about here is how to have a

workable suppression hearing. And if you require 

showings of different levels of fault, rather than 

asking was this police-generated error, the suppression 

hearings are going to be somewhat more cumbersome. So 

you have a choice.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly. You give 

something, you get something. If you adopt a negligence 

theory, the --

MS. KARLAN: We would be happen with the 

negligence theory.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the noose is not as 

wide, but on the other hand it's a lot harder to 

calculate whether you -- every case involves an inquiry 

into whether there's police negligence or not.

 MS. KARLAN: That's exactly what I'm --

JUSTICE SCALIA: A much easier rule, was 

there a warrant or not? If there wasn't, end of the --

end of the inquiry.

 MS. KARLAN: Well, that's exactly why I --

why I said I think the easier rule for judges faced with 

suppression hearings is a rule that says --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I don't know what 

the underlying law is here. I mean -- I guess it's 

little weird, but what happens if the policeman arrests 

the wrong person, but it's nobody's fault? You know,

the person was pretending to be his brother.

 MS. KARLAN: Well, that's like --

JUSTICE BREYER: Or the mother said it's 

John and it's really Joe. And so, the policeman wasn't 

at fault. They arrest the wrong person. I guess that's 

happened in history --

MS. KARLAN: Sure.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- but do they suppress 

things then? I wouldn't think so --

MS. KARLAN: Well, there are two different 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- but maybe they do.

 MS. KARLAN: There are two different kinds 

of cases where police arrest people: One set of cases 

where the policeman is arresting on the basis of 

probable cause, and there, there's a lot of room for 

error that is based on the facts. The mother told him 

it was Joe when it was really John. That's good enough, 

good enough, because that's probable cause.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But do we suppress?

 MS. KARLAN: No, you do not --

JUSTICE BREYER: We do not? Okay.

 MS. KARLAN: There was not even a Fourth --

JUSTICE BREYER: So there's no reason then,

of the policeman, none, it was just a weird 

circumstance, then I don't understand why we would 

suppress here. And nor do I understand why you have to 

argue this because I thought it's clear here that there 

is error, and it was negligently caused. There were 

four months that went by without anybody doing anything 

about this mistake.

 MS. KARLAN: No. That's correct. If I can 

just say one thing that will make this perhaps a little 

clearer, Justice Breyer, you would not even find a 

Fourth Amendment violation in the first place in the 

hypothetical you gave because there was probable cause 

to arrest.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't there probable cause 

here?

 MS. KARLAN: Probable cause to do what?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He thought he had a 

warrant; he had probable cause to arrest.

 MS. KARLAN: There is no such thing as 

probable cause to believe there's a warrant. You 

yourself in Hudson said it's a bright-line rule. Either 

there's a warrant or there isn't. Here there was no 

warrant.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's just 

rephrasing it. It's probable cause based on the

 MS. KARLAN: This Court has never said that 

before, which is it's not probable cause to believe 

there's a crime because there's a warrant. It's --

you've always separated those two lines of cases for --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't seem to make 

sense, though. Why should we separate the two?

 MS. KARLAN: Well, because here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If the policeman is 

mistaken about whether he saw this guy picking 

somebody's pocket, he's mistaken about that, and in that 

case, the search is -- the product of the search is 

admitted. In the other case he's mistaken about whether 

there was a warrant. Why do you want to draw a line 

between those two?

 MS. KARLAN: Well, for two reasons: One is, 

even in the probable cause case, if the reason he 

thought there was probable cause is another officer told 

him there was probable cause and that officer was wrong, 

this Court said in Leon you continue to suppress. Here, 

this police officer was told by other police personnel 

that there was a warrant, and there wasn't. So it's a 

case just like the cases post-Leon -- you suppress when 

the chain of information is fatally flawed by police

error, which is what happened here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, you would impose 

a burden on the officer on the street serving a warrant? 

When he gets the call saying there's a warrant, he's 

supposed to say, "Are you sure? Did you double-check 

with the clerk? When was the last time they updated the 

computer system? I don't want to go through all this if 

the evidence is going to be suppressed." At every chain 

in command, you would impose that burden.

 MS. KARLAN: No, I would not, Mr. Chief 

Justice, because if you announce that police error is 

going to lead to the suppression of evidence, the police 

will do a better job of maintaining their records.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but I mean I 

don't know what the situation is like --

MS. KARLAN: And then you won't have this 

problem.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know what 

the situation is like in Dale County. They probably 

don't have the latest version of WordPerfect, or 

whatever it is. They are probably making do with 

whatever they can under their budget and doing the best 

they can.

 MS. KARLAN: But there's not a Barney Fife 

defense to the violation of the Fourth Amendment either.

If a department is having its records kept the way they 

are keeping them here, then suppression is the only 

thing that tells them: You're going to have to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you said this 

wasn't anything in the record about what type of program 

they might have, whether they were updated. They found 

the mistake in ten minutes.

 MS. KARLAN: Which suggests if they had been 

doing a good job of maintaining their records all along, 

this violation never would have occurred.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what's the 

justification for drawing a distinction between a court 

employee and everybody who works for the police 

department? Suppose the person who makes the mistake in 

the police department is a -- a person who holds a 

unionized position where advancement is based purely on 

seniority, or it's a civil service position where the 

person is -- is totally protected from any sort of 

adverse job consequences as a result of displeasure 

about or pleasure about how the job is being -- being 

performed.

 And what's the justification for drawing a 

distinction between errors committed by those two 

employees just based on where they fit in the 

organizational box?

MS. KARLAN: Well, three things: One is the 

police themselves are often unionized and protected from 

retaliation.

 Second --

JUSTICE ALITO: What if it's not a police 

officer; it is not a law enforcement officer? It is a 

clerical employee, or it's a computer guy.

 MS. KARLAN: Well, I think that the clearest 

line is inside the police and outside, and let me give 

you a couple of reasons why. The first reason --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, one is that you --

you are stuck with the Arizona v. Evans, which says if 

it's the court --

MS. KARLAN: Well, if it's the court, yes; 

but I -- I was going to give some reasons why the police 

department should be treated as an integrated whole.

 One reason why is in many departments 

officers, sworn officers, who are on desk duty for 

physical disabilities and the like, perform clerical 

tasks.

 The second is on the record in this case. 

We don't know whether it was a sworn officer who removed 

the warrant from the file or it was a clerk, and there's 

no way of finding that out now.

 A third reason, if I could just point to

this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.

 MS. KARLAN: -- this Court, for just a 

moment, is clerical personnel, support personnel --

there is a reason they are called "support personnel". 

They support the mission of the office, and here this 

office decided to maintain its records in a particular 

way and to have this quick reference file and the like, 

presumably to support --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the Coffee 

County people aren't called "support officers" for the 

Dale County police.

 MS. KARLAN: They are support for the 

police, and this Court has --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now you keep saying 

this when you did this in your brief. You just call 

everybody "police," "police," "police," when the 

question is whether there's a distinction between the 

Coffee County police and the Dale County police for 

purposes of applying the exclusionary rule.

 MS. KARLAN: This Court, at least since 

Elkins, has recognized that police departments often 

operate across the board. If I could point to Leon 

itself, in Leon the search was conducted by California 

municipal police, and the evidence was used in Federal

court.

 And this Court never suggested, not even for 

a minute, that the fact that the evidence was obtained 

by State-level -- local-level police and used in a 

Federal prosecution was relevant to the question whether 

or not it should be suppressed. Because what the Court 

is trying to do in the exclusionary rule, as I 

understand it, is to deter future violations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's crucial to your case 

MS. KARLAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- really, that you -- that 

the police will not keep good records unless -- unless 

we let the criminals go.

 MS. KARLAN: That they need a powerful 

incentive.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's the theory of 

the exclusionary rule as --

MS. KARLAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- as has been expressed in 

writings in some of our prior cases. Things have 

changed a whole lot since we adopted the exclusionary 

rule, and I think it's quite -- policing has become much 

more professional, and I think it's quite unrealistic to 

think that if we don't adopt the rule that you -- that

you propose, police -- police departments will just 

willy-nilly not keep track of warrants. I -- I just 

don't think that's true. That's not professional 

policing, and -- and I think to say -- to apply the --

the severe remedy that you propose in this -- in this 

area at this date seems to me excessive.

 MS. KARLAN: Well, we don't think this is a 

severe remedy, and we think that the professionalism of 

the police is in substantial part a response to the 

message that the exclusionary rule sends, which is 

either you professionalize your police departments or 

the evidence they obtain is going to be suppressed; 

either you maintain good records or the reliance on 

those records is going to lead to suppression.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't think that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: We don't know if these 

records are good, bad, or indifferent. As far as this 

record shows, this could be an isolated incident, or it 

could be typical of what goes on. We just don't know.

 MS. KARLAN: It could be, and if I can just 

point to -- if you look at the Government's brief at 

page 48, they talk about how the FBI maintains its 

"Wanted" lists now. And they show that due to a list of 

reforms they were able to cut the error rate there from 

about 6 percent to about 3 percent. None of those

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The exclusionary rule under this Court's 

cases has always been a balance between the interest in 

achieving some deterrence of police misconduct and the 

high cost of excluding probative evidence of criminal 

activity. The exclusionary rule does not put the error 

back in the box. It does not correct it. It serves

only as incentives for future compliance to avoid future 

Fourth Amendment errors.

 In this case, where nothing is shown other 

than a negligent and isolated clerical error in the 

maintenance of warrants, there is no showing that 

suppression of evidence will achieve the kind of 

appreciable deterrence that this Court has said is 

necessary before the exclusionary rule is applied.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we assume on the 

basis of the record that there is negligence in this 

case?

 MR. DREEBEN: The district court did find 

that there was negligence. There is very little in the 

record, Mr. Chief Justice, that explains precisely what 

did happen. But I would take issue with my colleague's 

comment that the record shows that there were no 

auditing procedures. The record simply was not made on 

whether there were auditing procedures.

 What the district court did find based on 

testimony is that the Dale County Clerk's Office and the 

Dale County Sheriff's Office both had a reliable system 

of recordkeeping on which law enforcement could rely. 

That's a finding of the district court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, Ms. Karlan made 

the point -- and I'd like to get your response to it --

that if we adopt something that depends on the showing 

of negligence, that that will require extensive hearings 

in every case into exactly what their computer update 

system was, and so on.

 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, I actually 

think that negligence alone should not be enough to 

justify suppression, because it would not produce the 

appreciable form of deterrence that this Court has said 

is warranted. But I also think that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: May I interrupt you there? 

I mean, why do you say that? I mean, we -- we have --

just getting outside the criminal law for a minute, we 

-- we've got a whole system of personal liability law in 

which the theory is that, in effect, requiring 

compensation for negligence, even though it is not an 

act of bad faith or malice, is -- is going to affect 

conduct. Why do you assume it will not affect conduct 

here?

 MR. DREEBEN: I'm not sure that it won't 

affect conduct to some degree, Justice Souter. I think 

the exclusionary rule requires far more than saying that 

it might affect conduct, and I think that what the Court 

should look at --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Don't you think it's 

probable that it will affect conduct? I mean, if the

police know that they are going to lose the case because 

they are engaging in a negligent or objectively 

unreasonable way in -- in relation to their 

warrant-keeping, they are going to be more careful.

 MR. DREEBEN: I think the incremental change 

in police behavior will be modest at best, and I think 

this is crucial to my view of the case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they won't know 

that they are going to lose a case. What they will know 

is that if they happen to arrest someone whom they 

should not have arrested anyway, they won't be able to 

prosecute him, right?

 MR. DREEBEN: That's precisely so.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So they are saving 

themselves nothing. I mean, this person would not have 

been stopped. I mean, if the difference was we -- we 

caught a criminal and we could have convicted him except 

because of the clerical error we can't, but that's not 

the situation. They would never have found this fellow 

but for the clerical error.

JUSTICE SOUTER: But they also, as in this 

case, in the course of -- of committing their -- their 

negligent arrest find evidence of a crime.

 MR. DREEBEN: They do. But from an ex ante 

perspective, Justice Souter, they can't know that, but 

they do have --

JUSTICE SOUTER: They can't know that, but 

we all know, as a practical matter, that that's why 

police want the -- the greatest scope to the arrest 

power.

 MR. DREEBEN: No, I think that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Because in the course of 

doing incidental searches, they find things. They know 

that, and we know that.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, what I think 

it's important for the Court to know is that the 

police have ample incentives as it stands to try to make 

their recordkeeping systems as accurately as possible. 

The police do not have an interest in believing that 

there is an outstanding warrant for someone's arrest 

when there is not.

 The first reason is that an arrest situation 

is a highly dangerous encounter for police officers. 

It's not one to be undertaken lightly. That's why this 

Court has rules that govern searches incident to arrest

in order to remove potential weapons from suspects. The 

police don't want to convert what would be an otherwise 

routine traffic stop or no stop at all into a felony 

encounter that could go bad for all concerned.

 Second, there is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there a 1983 violation 

here?

 MR. DREEBEN: On the facts of this case, 

Justice Kennedy, I would not say there is 1983 

liability. It's a litigable issue whether there would 

be the potential for a plaintiff to show, as the 

defendant in this case did not try to show, that there 

was a degree of deliberate indifference to a need to 

have a reliable recordkeeping system such that some 

official would be personally liable for the failure to 

have that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose if the concern 

were that the police would become sloppy, then a 1983 

suit would be more likely?

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes. I think a 1983 suit, and 

there is ample evidence that many such suits have been 

brought, and we cite cases in our brief and the 

Petitioner cites cases in his brief.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, can I go back

the police department have to withdraw warrants that 

have been cancelled? Why not just leave them there? As 

long as they are there, it would justify an arrest.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, that assumes, I think, 

contrary to this Court's assumption of good faith on 

governmental actors --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If you put aside good 

faith for the moment. If you just think in terms of 

incentives of officers, would they not have an incentive 

just to leave everything there?

 MR. DREEBEN: No. There are three reasons 

why they would not. The first is the danger factor, as 

I mentioned.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The existence or 

nonexistence of the warrant doesn't affect the danger.

 MR. DREEBEN: Oh, it certainly does, because 

it converts what would otherwise be not a stop at all or 

a reasonable suspicion stop into a felony arrest. And 

when the police are undertaking an arrest, this Court 

has recognized that suspects often have an incentive to 

escape or to use weapons to resist --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the incentive exists 

whether there is a warrant in his pocket or not.

 MR. DREEBEN: If there is no warrant, there 

will be no arrest. And that's why the police have an

incentive to clean up the records so that they don't 

send out the police on warrant situations when there is 

no warrant.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, what you've 

said about the danger to the arresting office -- officer 

and so they don't undertake an arrest lightly, doesn't 

fit with the facts of this case. This was a police 

officer who really wanted to go after the defendant. He 

expected -- he suspected defendant was a bad guy. So 

that's how this all started. So he called his own 

department, do we have any warrant, and then the next 

county's department. But this was an officer who wanted 

to go after the defendant.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

assume that the Court will make its decision not based 

on the conduct of Officer Anderson in this case, but in 

an assessment nationwide of whether the exclusionary 

rule is necessary because the police lack incentives to 

keep warrant systems up to date. And I'm giving reasons 

why institutionally the police do have that incentive 

and, therefore, undertake those kinds of efforts.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And there are three 

reasons. One is to reduce the incidence of arrests, so 

they don't have the hazard of felony arrests.

 Number two is?

Official - Subject to Final Review 

MR. DREEBEN: The second reason is police 

resources. It takes a lot of time and energy to 

undertake a felony arrest. Many jurisdictions have 

dedicated warrant forces which seek to serve outstanding 

warrants, and they don't want to spend their time doing 

it on warrants that have been recalled.

 Similarly, in a case like this, the police 

happened to find drugs on Petitioner's person and a gun 

in his car, but if they had found nothing and taken him 

down to the station house and booked him, that would 

have been taking two police officers off the street for 

an afternoon, wasting their resources so that they're 

not engaged in the kind of protection of the community 

that the police force wants to do.

 And the third reason is that it does not 

create community goodwill to undertake arrests when 

people do not have warrants and simply because of a 

mistake in police records they're hauled downtown. 

That's the kind of thing that creates friction between 

the police and communities.

 JUSTICE BREYER: There is one question I 

have in my mind, and it's the only factor I thought of 

hypothetically that cuts against you. This is the 

argument and I'd like you to respond to it.

 I take everything you said as so. I'll

assume all that. And so I'd still say the rule, the 

basic rule of suppression, putting Leon to the side, 

basic rule is -- the opposite of Holmes: If the 

constable blunders, you suppress the evidence. Okay.

 Now, our prior case -- here we have a case 

where the constable blundered. I grant you, not the 

arresting officer. It was a different policeman, and it 

was a different form of error. But five months this 

thing -- this warrant had been recalled five months 

earlier and you agree that it was negligent. Therefore, 

the constable blundered. And the virtue of our earlier 

case where we said don't suppress, it wasn't the 

constable who blundered. So I see an absolutely clear 

line: If the constable blunders you suppress; if it's 

somebody else who blundered, you don't.

 Now, every time I've tried to think of a 

substitute for that clear line, I've run into trouble. 

I've been sitting in my chambers with my law clerks and 

we've tried out five substitutes, and I can't find one 

decent substitute that isn't filled with problems.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is your substitute?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, my first answer, Justice 

Breyer, is that this Court's exclusionary rule 

jurisprudence already draws a number of careful lines

based on the balance that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Right. Well, I'm 

overstating my point. What I'm really driving at and 

trying to show you is you, if you want to have a 

different rule than within the prior case, remember the 

one where it wasn't the police that blundered, you have 

to come up with some rule. And I want to know what your 

rule is.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, the rule, to state it 

simply, that I think should govern this case is: An 

isolated and negligent police clerical error in the 

maintenance of warrant records should not lead to 

suppression. And the reason for that is there are ample 

incentive for the police to attempt to correct their own 

records such that the exclusionary rule would not 

approve --

JUSTICE BREYER: So now we have -- let's 

think about that. The special rule is now we have the 

Leon exception and now we have a new exception, and the 

new exception is called for isolated police clerical 

errors. Well, that's going to be interesting, I 

suspect.

 The first thing you'll have when you try to 

impose your rule is you will have the defense attorneys 

throughout the city going in to see if it's an isolated

error. And they will, of course, have a right to decide 

whether or not this is the only such error, whether 

there are other clerical errors, how often they occur, 

what the -- is that an administrable rule?

 MR. DREEBEN: I think it's highly 

administrable. It doesn't create that many problems. 

This exclusionary rule hearing is an illustration. The 

warrant clerk for Dale County was on the witness stand. 

The warrant clerk for Coffee County was on the witness 

stand. The arresting officer was on the witness stand. 

All of those people were asked, do these errors occur 

with frequency? They said: They don't; our system is 

reliable.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if there were 

pervasive deficiencies, I assume that's exactly what we 

would inquire about under 1983?

 MR. DREEBEN: That's correct, Justice 

Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And would you add 1983 as 

number four to your list?

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, I would add number -- I 

would add 1983 possible liability as an additional 

incentive, just as it was remarked in Hudson that it 

provides for additional incentive for --

JUSTICE BREYER: One other question.

Suppose that the error here consisted not of a computer, 

but rather Joe, who is the policeman, has a partner 

called Sam, and Sam told Joe that this is Harry Smith, 

when negligently it wasn't Harry Smith? It was Joe 

Smith.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean does that 

count as a clerical error if, in fact, it's the man's 

partner who tells him this negligently?

 MR. DREEBEN: I'm with Miss Karlan on this 

one. I don't think that's a Fourth Amendment violation 

at all. I think under Hill v. California --

JUSTICE BREYER: Negligent. It's Negligent 

police work.

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes. It's a mistake.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's negligent error. 

You mean we don't suppress the negligent errors of the 

partners who, after all, say, let's arrest this man over 

here, and through negligence they have got the wrong 

man? We don't suppress?

 MR. DREEBEN: I think that that's a very 

close case, and I don't think that this Court --

JUSTICE BREYER: There must be millions --

not millions, but there must have been cases where two 

policemen or one policeman goes off to arrest someone

and negligently arrests the wrong man. And when he does 

that and does a search, we don't suppress.

 MR. DREEBEN: What we know about that from 

this Court's cases is that if one police officer has a 

warrant and it's, he obtained it based on an affidavit, 

that's purely a bare-bones --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's Leon. I'm not 

thinking that.

 MR. DREEBEN: No, it's actually not Leon. 

It's Whiteley versus Warden. And I'm positing a warrant 

that was completely based on a bare-bones affidavit. So 

it would not pass the Leon test.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not thinking of a 

warrant. I'm thinking of a policeman who has a warrant 

for Jack Smith and he goes to arrest Jack Brown because 

through negligence he went to the wrong house. Now, 

under those circumstances would we suppress the drugs 

that happen to be found in Jack's house.

 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think it's so clear 

from this Court's cases.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there must have been 

a lot of cases.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, not in this Court.

courts? What have they done?

MR. DREEBEN: I'm not so aware that there 

are so many of them in the lower courts where it's 

negligence. Most often the kind of mistakes that's 

made, the courts say it's within the realm of probable 

cause if it's a reasonable mistake. If it's an 

unreasonable mistake, negligent mistake, I would be 

prepared to say that the lower courts are probably today 

suppressing. And this Court doesn't have to decide 

whether that's correct in order to decide this case. 

This case --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we use the word or the 

phrase "good faith" in writing the opinion if we write 

it your way?

 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think the Court needs 

to use the word "good faith." The Court used the words 

"good faith" in Leon. It's repeated it in all of its 

so-called good faith exclusionary rule exceptions. 

We're talking about an objective rule, and the line that 

I think that the Court should draw today is between 

isolated negligent errors and errors that result from a 

more systematic or widespread pattern, the kind that 

Justice O'Connor referred to in her concurrence in 

Arizona v. Evans.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You would allow all of that 

inquiry every time there's a motion to exclude. That

would not just be the basis for 1983. You still want 

negligence inquiry.

 MR. DREEBEN: I don't want it. I'm saying 

that the Court doesn't have to reach the issue today of 

whether a widespread pattern of errors or complete 

neglect --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you. That's a little 

different.

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes. That's not to say --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What about reaching -- what 

about reaching your standard in cases in which the 

arrest is wrong, not because there's no warrant, but 

because there's just slightly less than probable cause? 

If there are isolated incidents of that are we going 

to -- are we going to say that in fact that does not 

violate the Fourth Amendment?

 MR. DREEBEN: I think that's a very 

different -- well, whether it violates the Fourth 

Amendment or not would turn on whether there is in fact 

probable cause. If there is no probable cause, and I 

understood your question, Justice Souter --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No. We're starting with 

the assumption that there is a violation of the -- I 

think we're starting with background law at this point 

that there is a violation of the Fourth Amendment if

there is an arrest without probable cause or without a 

valid warrant.

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The warrant itself may be 

subject to attack, but at least that's sort of the front 

line of our objective reasonableness inquiry. And 

you're making a dent in the warrant requirement for 

isolated incidents, and I don't see why we can't or why 

coherence would not require us to make the same dent in 

the probable cause requirement for equally isolated 

mistakes.

 MR. DREEBEN: I think it's simply a 

different inquiry, Justice Souter, because, as I tried 

to explain, in this area the Court can note a number of 

incentives that law enforcement has to keep its warrant 

databases accurate and up to speed.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, can I ask a 

background question? How frequent does the issue in 

this case arise?

 MR. DREEBEN: In my experience, Justice 

Stevens, not that frequently.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's my understanding, 

too.

may have more symbolic importance than practical 

importance.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think that the 

practical importance of it and the legal importance of 

it is what, kind of a balance is the Court going to 

strike under the exclusionary rule. We heard a lot from 

Petitioner today about how the exclusionary rule would 

help make police engage in better practices. We heard 

nothing about the costs of the exclusionary rule. 

Compared to, for example, to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Are there any cases where 

-- this is a drug peddler here that was caught. Are 

there any cases involving violent criminals that have 

been affected by the outcome of this case?

 MR. DREEBEN: Some in the lower courts have 

involved violent crime, and I think this case would look 

and feel very different if evidence of a murder had been 

discovered in the car. And that just accentuates the 

point that the exclusionary rule comes with a price to 

society. It's not free.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, if we adopt 

your formulation that isolated negligence doesn't count, 

is it clear that that's all there was in this case?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, that's all that the 

district court found. The district court had evidence

and made a finding that there was no pattern of 

violations like this, that the system of recordkeeping 

was generally reliable. This is the findings of the 

district court that are on page 17a and 18a of the 

Petitioner appendix. The district court concluded: 

"There is no credible evidence of routine problems with 

disposing of warrants and the warrant clerk herself 

could not recall other instances like this."

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if Miss Karlan's 

figures are correct in Alabama there would be 

suppression.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, there was no record made 

whatsoever on what Alabama's overall --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I said if her figures 

are correct and there's a 13 percent error rate either 

in the State of Alabama or at least in the department 

involved that we'd have suppression there.

 MR. DREEBEN: Unless -- if the Court is 

prepared to say that the exclusionary rule is going to 

function differently on a State by State basis depending 

on the statewide error rate, which I think is an unusual 

thing for the Court to do --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's going to 

function -- even on your theory, it's going to function 

differently on a department to department basis

depending on the error rate.

 MR. DREEBEN: Upon a -- Not just upon a 

showing of an error rate, but upon a showing that a 

particular recordkeeping system that produced an error 

was conducted in a manner so that you could say much 

more than negligence was involved here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if you've got a 13 

percent error rate I think you've got a pretty good 

prima facie case.

 MR. DREEBEN: You do. I would concede you 

have a good prima facie case. I would want to know more 

to know what that really means because with a lot of 

these statistics --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But the fact is unless the 

"more" showed that they were getting a 13 percent error 

rate in a negligence-free system, you would have 

suppression there and you would not have suppression 

there in the town next door or the county next door or 

the State next door.

 MR. DREEBEN: If the Court adopts a rule 

that says that a showing of more than isolated 

negligence would justify suppression, you're correct. I 

would note, though, that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But I thought that 

basically was the distinction that you were arguing for.

MR. DREEBEN: No. I think I clarified to 

Justice Scalia that I think all the Court needs to 

decide today is that an isolated negligent error in 

police recordkeeping should not result in suppression. 

It should not hold today because it's not confronted 

with today --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But I take it if you're not 

accepting -- if you're not accepting -- I mean, you're 

not accepting the proposition that the 13 percent error 

rate which is not somehow shown to be non-negligent 

should have a different result, you are saying in the 13 

percent case we're still not going to suppress.

 MR. DREEBEN: I would reserve the right to 

argue that the exclusionary rule's costs outweigh its 

benefits even if that is shown in a particular case 

because there are a myriad of other reasons why the 

police would have an incentive to improve that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if you -- if you were 

to make that argument and it came down to that bald a 

proposition, I assume you would come in with some kind 

of evidentiary basis to tell us exactly what the cost 

is. And you have spoken of the cost today. You have 

not spoken of the benefit and the value of having 

relatively error-free arrest recordkeeping. But I 

haven't heard anything about the unreasonable cost of

the exclusionary rule --

MR. DREEBEN: Well I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- beyond the record.

 MR. DREEBEN: It's manifested in it every 

case in which reliable probative evidence is suppressed.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, sure it is. But that 

does not even get us to, as it were, to half the 

equation. We want to be know how much of that there is 

and we want to be able to measure against that the value 

that society is getting by requiring valid arrest 

warrants and in a probable cause case by requiring 

probable cause. And you can't just walk in and say, 

well, there's a cost. We know there's a cost.

 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think, Justice Souter, 

that the Court has ever looked for an empirical count of 

how many cases.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Don't you think we should 

if we are in effect -- if you are making what sounds to 

me like an empirical argument -- there is a cost to 

society, cases are being lost, criminals are going free 

-- don't you think that we ought to have a factual basis 

to know what that cost is?

 MR. DREEBEN: If the Court wants one in 

order to justify the exclusionary rule, then it probably 

needs to go back to scratch and start all over again.

JUSTICE SOUTER: We've done an exclusionary 

rule now and in effect you are arguing for an exception 

to it because the cost is too great, and it seems to me 

the burden is on you to tell us what the cost figure is.

 MR. DREEBEN: I will say this, Justice 

Souter. If the cost is very low because very few cases 

result in suppression, then deterrence is also very low 

because there are very few cases in which evidence is 

being suppressed.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if you take that 

argument to the extreme, we won't have an exclusionary 

rule at all, I suppose.

 MR. DREEBEN: But my argument today does not 

require the Court to take that step at all because this 

is an area in which there is a local geography of 

incentive pertaining to the accuracy of warrants that 

allows the Court to conduct the balance in a way 

distinct from what it might do if it's confronted with 

police negligence or if it's confronted with a 

widespread pattern of negligence.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, if you did the 

cost-benefit analysis the way Justice Stewart would, the 

cost is always zero to the State because they would not 

have had the evidence if they had obeyed the law.

Stevens, that form of looking at the question has been 

rejected in this Court's cases that have recognized that 

the exclusionary rule has to pay its way because in 

every case in which it results in suppression there is a 

cost to society and the benefit therefore needs to be 

appreciable and this Court needs to be confident of that 

before it concludes that what the Court called the 

"massive remedy of exclusion" is applied in any 

particular case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We know what the 

cost was here, right? I mean, not just a drug peddler, 

but somebody with an illegal weapon found in his car, a 

weapon that presumably he would use on an occasion in 

which it was in his view appropriate to do so.

 MR. DREEBEN: Correct. There was benefit in 

this very case and cost if the evidence is suppressed.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But don't you take -- I 

understood you to take the position and I thought the 

Court had previously taken the position that the cost 

benefit analysis had to be a systemic one.

 MR. DREEBEN: I think that that's correct, 

Justice Souter, but I'm not aware of any case in which 

the Court has said the exclusionary rule has costs and 

now we need to see the numbers of statistically how many 

cases result in suppression. I'm just not aware of any

case in which the Court has done that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I think that's -- I 

think that's true. I mean, we operate -- quite think 

frankly we operate on the basis of a -- of a good guess 

and I think your argument is saying let's have -- let's 

have an exception to the good guess. And if -- if you 

start with a good guess as the baseline it seems to me 

you -- you ought to have something more than another 

guess to justify the exception.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Souter what my 

case comes down to today I believe is the proposition 

that when we are talking about clerical errors made by 

the police, there are ample incentives for the police 

not to make those clerical errors that I've described 

earlier, such that the incremental benefit of the 

exclusionary rule which we know has a cost; it has a 

tangible cost in every case in which it's applied; does 

not pay its own way. In other words, there is no 

sufficient incremental deterrence to warrant taking an 

isolated negligent error in a generally reliable system 

and saying we need to suppress evidence anyway; and 

Petitioner's argument goes farther than the isolated 

negligent error case. It says even if the police have 

driven the error rate down as low as it's humanly 

possible by committing mass amounts of are resources to

warrant database systems in order to avoid suppression, 

which is what the Petitioner's theory posits, you should 

still suppress; and that seems to me nothing other than 

the return to the theory when there is a Fourth 

Amendment violation, suppression automatically follows; 

and this Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not what we 

have here, and we have a 13 percent error rate. If this 

case goes your way, the police have limited resources; 

why should they spend them on upgrading their computer 

system when if there is an error it wasn't matter?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, it does matter, Justice 

Ginsburg, because the police officers that I'm familiar 

with and the agencies that I'm familiar with as 

exemplified by the NCIC which is the national database, 

says that the last thing that we want to do is send 

officers mistakenly out on a felony arrest where they 

are going to be placed in a potentially dangerous 

situation spending community police resources to arrest 

somebody who should not be arrested. This is not what 

they want to do. They have a good reason to avoid being 

placed in that situation and I would caution the Court 

against relying on a 13 percent figure in a study that's 

submitted in a brief to this Court for the first time 

without any kind of adversarial testing. That is not I

this think a reliable basis for the Court to infer that 

this particular police department had that kind of an 

error rate or that the exclusionary rule is necessary to 

prevent it from having that kind of an error rate or 

even that there were no procedures in place to prevent 

errors and warrants from remaining in the system.

 The record simply doesn't show that. The 

warrant clerks were on the stand and neither party asked 

them the question so this Court doesn't have the 

information to say today was there a system that would 

have ferreted this out. We know that if there was it 

failed in this case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In Hudson versus Michigan, 

didn't the Court engage in a very broad balancing of the 

social costs and the potential for increase in 

violations in saying that there was no necessity for the 

suppression rule in the no-knock case?

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Kennedy; the 

Court did just that and it began with the outset that 

the massive remedy of suppression of evidence is a high 

social cost that should not be borne by society, not 

just the police, by all of us, unless appreciable 

deterrence will result as a benefit; and the Court then 

examined the incentives that the police had not to make 

illegal no-knock entries and to add that whatever

incremental benefit there might be from exclusion was 

not justified in light of the possibility of 198e 

liability and the increased professionalism of the 

police which has made it less necessary to make the 

exclusionary rule a remedy of first resort rather than 

last resort. While this Court could conceptualize the 

case as one in which the government is looking for an 

exception to the exclusionary rule, I think it's more 

accurately one where the Court should extend the 

exclusionary rule to cover negligent police clerical 

errors. For the first time, at this day and age when 

1983 recoveries have become effective --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many 1983 recoveries 

have there been when someone says the police, they 

convicted me on the basis of this evidence that wasn't 

suppressed, but they committed a Fourth Amendment 

violation so I should prevail in the 1983 action? How 

many defendants in that situation have ever won a 1983 

action?

 MR. DREEBEN: No one knows, Justice 

Ginsburg, because a great many of these cases will 

settle out of court, but our brief does provide examples 

of conduct that was more serious and more egregious than 

anything involved in this case resulting in situations 

where courts denied summary judgments to the defendants

and ordered the cases to go to trial.

 And I'm not suggesting that in a case like 

this -- may I complete the answer -- there should be a 

1983 remedy, but I am suggesting that civil remedies 

will provide incentives to the police to avoid the bog 

of litigation by putting into place systems that will 

prevent this kind of error.

remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I use 30 seconds of 

your eight minutes because I want some clarity on this.

 MS. KARLAN: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Divide in your mind two 

separate things: The nature of the bad conduct: is it 

negligent, reckless, deliberate; and the other question 

is who engaged in it -- a police department official or 

some other official?

 I thought this case was about the second 

question, but now I'm confused about the first question 

because I suppose a policeman, an arresting officer 

makes a negligent error. He goes to the wrong house. 

And he never looks at the number; and he arrests, starts

to arrest the wrong person: Is the evidence suppressed?

 If the evidence isn't suppressed, frankly, I 

don't see why a clerical official should be held to a 

higher standard; but if the evidence is suppressed then 

quite possibly the clerical official should be held to 

the same standard. So you've heard the government say 

well, the answer isn't clear; very often a negligent 

official -- a negligent officer would not have that 

evidence suppressed. Well, what is it?

 MS. KARLAN: The answer to your question, 

Justice Breyer, is if the police officer in your 

hypothetical was negligent the evidence would be 

suppressed. There are cases where the mistake of the 

officer was a reasonable mistake, that is. He did not 

JUSTICE BREYER: He was not.

 MS. KARLAN: Then he was not negligent.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I want to know if he is 

negligent.

 MS. KARLAN: If he is negligent --

JUSTICE BREYER: Excuse me, because I think 

I'm getting a different view from the government.

 MS. KARLAN: I'm absolutely certain that the 

answer is if he was negligent then there was not 

probable cause; if there was not probable cause and one

of the other exceptions to the exclusionary rule does 

not apply, then the evidence will be suppressed.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the definition of 

negligence is that he was not objectively reasonable?

 MS. KARLAN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So we've got 

this --

MS. KARLAN: And the rule we are asking for 

here -- the narrow rule for our Petitioner is when you 

have negligent error by police officials, you suppress 

but as Justice Scalia pointed out in my colloquy with 

him earlier, that rule is perhaps slightly less workable 

than a rule that says all error.

 Now we have given you a workable rule here 

and we still have not heard I believe a workable rule 

from the government; because what Mr. Dreeben tells you 

is that under some circumstances there will be 

suppression. And I just want to make up with factual 

correction here which is about the 13 percent. It was a 

study by the FBI. It's a very dated study because they 

haven't done a more recent one and it was statewide. 

But let assume for purposes of argument here that if 13 

percent of the errors in the file are there because the 

police are not maintaining their records properly, there 

ought to be suppression of a warrantless arrest based on

that because otherwise you're really telling the 

department that "good enough for government work" is, 

you know, one out of six warrants is invalid, one out of 

seven warrants is invalid, but that's okay.

 So then what you would have to have in each 

case is a hearing, and at the hearing we would be 

entitled to discovery --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in that -- but in that 

hypothetical I think it might be easy to say that the 

policeman on the beat was not objectively reasonable in 

relying.

 MS. KARLAN: But Justice Kennedy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's certainly not 

the case here.

 MS. KARLAN: But Justice Kennedy, if you 

believe in the government's rule we should have a right 

to audit that system to show that 13 percent of the 

warrants --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I agree with that. If --

to say with Mr. Dreeben that we don't have to decide 

that today is just unrealistic. We have to decide today 

whether we are going to adopt a rule that down the road 

will turn every exclusionary request into a pretrial 

investigation of the procedures of the police.

 MS. KARLAN: Yes. That's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And a major -- major trial.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not the procedures 

of the police. The officer is on the stand and you say, 

all right, you've been here a while, how many times have 

these warrants turned out to be wrong, just as simple as 

it was in this case? And he says, gosh, this is the 

first time that I've had this question.

 MS. KARLAN: But one of the things we know 

from the oral argument and the transcript in Evans is 

that clerk said this is the first time there has ever 

been an error, and it turned out there were four errors 

them made the same day.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Cross-examine 

people. These people are under oath, you cross-examine. 

You say, I don't think that's right. How many times? 

It's not that big a deal to find out on what basis the 

arresting officer was acting.

 MS. KARLAN: Right. But we would be 

entitled I think, Mr. Chief Justice, to say to the clerk 

on the stand, have you ever conducted an audit? She 

says, no, but our system is reliable.

 At that point I think we are entitled to an 

audit. That is we are entitled to hire an expert at 

government expense to figure out how many times this 

department has gotten it wrong.

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't your rule also going 

to require hearings. If negligence is required --

MS. KARLAN: The hearing in this case --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- you are going to have to 

have a hearing on whether there was negligence. And if 

so, who was negligent. If only causation is required, 

you're going to have to have a hearing on who caused it.

 MS. KARLAN: Justice Alito, we had a hearing 

in this case that's adequate to the rule that we have 

and it took approximately two hours.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And will that be the case in 

every instance?

 MS. KARLAN: It will be the case more often 

then that you'll have a two-hour hearing that you have 

to show isolated --

JUSTICE ALITO: How do you know that? What 

basis do you have for saying that? How do you know 

that? How many of these hearings have you examined?

 MS. KARLAN: Hearings in which there was no 

warrant? I have examined none, but I can't imagine that 

it would take more than two hours. In this case it took 

two hours.

 All you have to do is figure out who said 

there was a warrant when there wasn't one. Was it a 

court employee under Evans? The answer is then clear.

You let the evidence in. Was it not the court, that is, 

everybody concedes that the court called, everybody 

concedes the warrant was removed, everybody concedes 

that the warrant went back? Then you answer it that 

way.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose it were an agency 

like INS or Customs in which they have many people that 

are not sworn officers or some that are, does it make a 

difference who answered the phone?

 MS. KARLAN: I don't think the sworn officer 

distinction makes a difference. I think the agency 

does.

 If I can refer to the State cases here, I 

think they can illustrate how to answer your question 

more precisely, Justice Kennedy. That is, a number of 

States suppress evidence under these circumstances, and 

they ask what's a question of law that then applies to 

all future cases, which is, is this agency an adjunct of 

law enforcement or is it something else?

 So, for example, in California, the 

Department of Corrections, not. They are not an 

adjunct. So errors by the Department of Corrections, 

evidence is admitted. The State of Florida, the 

Department of Motor Vehicles is an adjunct. So there if 

the Department of Motor Vehicles makes the mistake,

there is suppression.

 This rule has been --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In Rand we said this is 

exactly the inquiry we are not going to make.

 MS. KARLAN: I'm not sure.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Rand was where we had a 

traffic stop made by a narcotics officer. And the 

question was, well, he was going outside his 

jurisdiction. We said we are not going to get into the 

way police departments are organized. We are just not 

going to do it.

 MS. KARLAN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's Rand.

 MS. KARLAN: No. I understand Rand 

perfectly well, Justice Kennedy. But the question here 

is not a Rand case. It's what counts as the police? 

And that's the only question we are asking you to answer 

here, is what counts as the police? Everyone who works 

for the police department. When they make an negligent 

error, that's enough.

 Now, let me turn for just a moment to the 

question of the bloated records and their incentives.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's your bottom line 

position, it has to be a negligent error?

 MS. KARLAN: In this case, yes. Yes. I'm

perfectly happy --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the position you're 

arguing for?

 MS. KARLAN: We are arguing for negligent --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You want to adopt a rule 

that's only when it's a negligent error?

 MS. KARLAN: We are arguing for that rule 

but wanted you to understand that there is a tradeoff as 

you identified earlier. Our rule is, I think, a clean, 

narrow rule. It may require, as Justice Alito has 

pointed out, slightly more detailed hearings.

 Let me turn now to this question of the 

incentives, which is the incentives of departments, as 

illustrated in this case, are to leave the question of 

maintaining records to the end of the line in spending 

their resources, because they are not going to have to 

serve these warrants. These warrants serve as an 

opportunity to stop and arrest someone they otherwise 

wouldn't be able to stop and arrest here, because they 

like probable cause.

 All they had to do to cite -- Justice 

Kennedy, to cite Rand to you is if they wanted to follow 

him for a while, I'm sure they could have found a motor 

vehicle violation at some point. But they didn't even 

want to do that. They just wanted to use this

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that's assuming 

bad faith on the part of the police.

 MS. KARLAN: No, it's good faith.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They want to arrest 

him, so they follow him until they find a motor vehicle 

violation.

 MS. KARLAN: This Court has said it's 

absolutely fine and it's not bad faith.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you're 

suggesting it's bad faith --

MS. KARLAN: No, I'm not suggesting that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- because they --

because they don't want to have to worry about getting a 

warrant that might be wrong?

 MS. KARLAN: No, no. That's not what I 

said, Mr. Chief Justice. May I please --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was the point 

of -- well, sure, as long as I'm asking the questions, 

you can answer.

then? You're saying, well, they want to get this guy

anything else. They can follow him, find the broken

taillight and then they would have gotten that guy. I 

thought that was the point you were trying to make?

 MS. KARLAN: No. The point I was -- the 

point I was trying to make is that there are other 

techniques here if you haven't as yet inarticulable 

suspicion that somebody is a bad guy that you can use 

that to comply with the Constitution. What you can't do 

is rely on a warrant that doesn't exist, and then turn 

around and say police error, but we are entitled to rely 

on our own error.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: May I ask one question, 

Chief.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Your -- your comment seems 

to assume that these warrants just lie there and the 

police only use them incidentally. I have always 

assumed that when a warrant is out, part of the job of 

the police is to -- is to arrest the person. Isn't that 

the case?

 MS. KARLAN: Well, there are really two very 

different kinds of warrants out there, Justice Scalia, 

as I understand it. One is warrants the police go and 

try and find themselves, and then they are trying to 

serve those aggressively. But there are a lot of 

warrants like this one that sat in a file for five

months, nobody tried to serve it during the vast 

majority of that time because a lot of these warrants, 

as is true in this case, are for failure to answer a 

calendar call or for not paying a parking fine on time 

or for not sending in your fine on a motor vehicle.

 In the Ott case that we cite it was failure 

to pay child support.

 So those are not the kinds of things where 

the police are serving the warrants aggressively.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you 

Miss Karlan, the case is submitted.
