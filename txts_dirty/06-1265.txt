 (10:04 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in case 06-1265, Klein & Co. Futures 

v. Board of Trade of the City of New York. 	 Mr. Days?

 MR. DAYS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 A clearing futures commodity merchant, an 

FCM, such as Petitioner, has standing to sue contract 

markets and clearing organizations of contract markets 

under Section 25 (b)(1) of the act for their bad faith 

failure to enforce rules that are required by the act 

and by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The 

court of appeal's contrary ruling should be reversed for 

three reasons, because it's contrary to the text of 

25(b)(1), it ignores the essential rule of clearing 

FCM's such as Petitioner recognized by the Commodity 

Exchange Act, as well as long-standing industry rules 

and practices -- an assessment with which the expert 

Federal agency, the Commodity Future Trading Commission 

concurs -- and it's in cross purposes with the goal that 

Congress sought to achieve in enacting an express 

private right of action in 25(b)(1) against contract 

markets, namely to ensure the existence of fair and 

orderly markets through a system of effective

subregulation. The plain language of the Commodity 

Exchange Act confers statutory standing on Petitioner to 

bring this private right of action against Respondents. 

25(b)(1) makes no reference to buyer or seller but 

instead confers standing on any person who engaged -- a 

person who engaged in any transaction on or subject to 

the rules of a contract market or licensed board of 

trade.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Days, can I interrupt 

you there, and ask, if you would --

MR. DAYS: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if you would define 

the transactions -- the particular transactions on which 

you rely to come within that provision and what rules of 

the exchange or the clearinghouse do you say was 

violated?

 MR. DAYS: Justice Ginsburg, we view this as 

several subsidiary transactions that ultimately end in 

the consummation of the contract, but with respect to 

the rules that we have in mind -- first of all Rule 6 

(a) talks about -- that can be found in the blue brief 

at 1a -- that such contract executed or consummated by 

or through a member of such contract market. This is a 

clearing FCM that does this. And 6 (a), along with the 

knife rule, that is the contract markets rule 121(f) and

306(i)(2), essentially indicate the following 

arrangement: No contract can be dealt with or entered 

into on a contract market without a guarantee from the 

clearing FCM. The FCM becomes the buyer and seller with 

respect to that particular contract. It assumes that 

contract and then, after assuming that contract, has to 

clear it immediately, indeed, within one hour. So 

that's -- those are the rules under the statute and with 

respect to the contract market.

 With respect to the clearing 

organization, Rule 401(a), which is found at the red 

brief at 6a, indicates that the clearing point, the 

clearing FCM is the point that deals with the clearing 

organization. And at that point, there's no 

communication, no contact -- no contract between the 

investor and the clearing organization. The clearing 

organization becomes the buyer and seller. In other 

words, the contract is between a clearing FCM on one 

side of the contract and a clearing FCM on the other 

side of the contract. The clearing organization becomes 

the buyer and seller, but before that happens, it's 

clear that the clearing organization views the clearing 

FCM as the party to the contract. It is not the 

investor. It is not any other party.

 The important thing also about this

process is that the clearing FCM is always financially 

liable from the very beginning of this transaction, this 

process, to the very end. That is, from the --

executing the contract and the consummation of the 

contract. For the Court of Appeals to talk about buyer 

or seller and treat a clearing FCM as a mere creditor or 

agent really misses entirely the role that clearing 

FCM's play in this process.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You think you --

MR. DAYS: I think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You've talked about 

the transaction, but I also ask you, what were the rules 

that the Defendants violated, the rules of the statute?

 MR. DAYS: Well, it's -- it is clear, as 

I indicated with respect to the rule of the contract 

market, that the clearing FCM is required to clear that 

particular order or contract. And, therefore, at that 

point, the clearing requires some information about the 

settlement price. Here the allegation is that there was 

fraud at the point where the settlement price was set. 

That then created a problem with the clearinghouse, and 

at the clearing process there was also a continuing 

violation because at both points the contract market and 

the clearing organization should have been applying 

their rules effectively and carefully, and we suggest

here that that was done in bad faith.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I think --

MR. DAYS: The cause of action, we 

understand, requires that there be a showing of bad 

faith.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- I don't want to 

reduce the issue down to something too simplistic, but 

is there a rule that says don't lie, don't commit fraud?

 MR. DAYS: Yes. In fact, the -- in order to 

be a contract -- a market designated by the CFTC and by 

the statute, there has to be a commitment to avoiding 

price manipulation and cornering the market or various 

other things of that kind. So that's in the statute, 

and it's also subject to the rules of the CFTC. That's 

a basic understanding. That's a given. Indeed, with 

respect to the whole question of settlement prices and 

margins, the understanding of those who participate in a 

commodity futures market is that they will establish 

their margins with the expectation that those rules will 

be applied fairly and firmly and in good faith.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Am I -- am I right that we 

really do not have to --

MR. DAYS: Excuse me?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Am I correct that we really 

do not have to determine that issue this morning?

MR. DAYS: What --

JUSTICE SOUTER: All we have to determine is 

whether it is possible for the Petitioner here to be 

within the class of those with standing?

 MR. DAYS: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. DAYS: This is a standing case, sir.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Days, suppose 

that the exchange has a standard sort of 

nondiscrimination provision with respect to employment 

practices, and it -- an employee asserts that she was 

discriminated against in the promotion review. Would 

she be covered by this provision?

 MR. DAYS: No, Your Honor. I think that 

Congress had in mind a limitation of the standing 

position -- that is standing -- a right to those who 

participate in the process, when it talks about a person 

who engaged in a transaction on or subject to the rules 

of the contract market --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose the 

transaction would be her annual employment review that 

she alleges violated the exchange rule saying the 

exchange would not discriminate on the basis of sex.

 MR. DAYS: I don't believe that that would 

be a transaction on or subject to the rules of the

contract market. She would not or he would not be a 

person whose transaction, that is the employment 

contract, would be carried out on or subject to the 

rules of the contract.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose, to narrow 

that hypothetical, that there's a rule that you can't be 

an employee of the clearinghouse or the exchange if you 

have a conviction for fraud, and they don't -- they're 

negligent and careless about enforcing that rule and 

that fraud causes the loss. Under either your theory or 

the government's theory, would there be liability, and 

is there a difference between those two theories?

 MR. DAYS: Well, the statute itself talks 

about the responsibilities of the contract market or the 

clearing organization. And it describes transactions, 

and transactions are described broadly but not in a way 

that would encompass the examples that you gave, Justice 

Kennedy.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so, the 

transaction has some substantive limitation that is 

derived from where?

 MR. DAYS: Well, it's derived from the 

statute, if one looks at Rule 2(i) in the statute. That 

describes transactions in a variety of ways. It's not 

in any of the appendices, but it can be located, I

believe, on page 5 of the yellow brief, where we talk 

about that and indeed the interpretation that was given 

by the Second Circuit in the Ken Roberts case, which we 

also cite at that page in the yellow brief.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in my hypothetical 

there is a transaction and there are actual damages --

I'm reading from -- from (b)(c). There's been a 

transaction and the liabilities for damages sustained by 

a person who engaged in the transaction or subject to 

the rules of the buyer.

 MR. DAYS: Well, Justice Kennedy, I want to 

focus on transaction. There's nothing that I've been 

able to find, nothing that the CFTC has indicated in 

this respect that would cover the hypothetical that you 

and Chief Justice Roberts had mentioned. Theoretically, 

yes, but I don't think that -- in fact not 

theoretically, yes, I would say the transaction does not 

incorporate those ancillary rules of an operation of a 

contract market.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why aren't 

these ancillary rules? When I think of a futures 

exchange market and the transaction, I think of the 

buyers and the sellers, you know, the longs and the 

shorts, and this strikes me as just kind of the 

paperwork in the back office. Why is that, why should

we assume that's covered by the term "transaction"?

 MR. DAYS: Well, it is a broad definition, 

but it focuses on the process of the execution and 

consummation of the contract, not matters that are 

unrelated. I would view, as was indicated in the 

American Agricultural Movement case, these people as 

nonparticipants in the operation of the core function of 

a contract market.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: These people -- you 

mean the ones in our hypotheticals.

 MR. DAYS: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you -- I find it 

difficult -- I'm finding it difficult to follow the 

exact language on page 4a of the appendix, of (b)(1)(C). 

To you, that's probably the key provision, right? And 

that's in the blue brief. And catch me when I read it 

wrong, if I do. As I -- as I see it, it says -- and 

here it says "a clearing organization." That's what we 

are interested in here, the clearing organization.

 MR. DAYS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, a clearing 

organization that doesn't enforce a bylaw properly or a 

rule or reg properly, which is what you're saying 

happened?

 MR. DAYS: Yes, sir.

JUSTICE BREYER: The clearing organization 

got all mixed and it all --

MR. DAYS: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, they're liable for 

actual damages to a person who engaged in a transaction 

in a contract market. That's what it says. And the 

contract market is the futures exchange.

 MR. DAYS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Not the clearing 

organization.

 MR. DAYS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And they're liable to that 

person for the actual losses that resulted from his 

transaction in the futures exchange --- as such 

transaction.

 MR. DAYS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So what your claim -- they 

were caused by the failure of the clearinghouse to 

follow its rules.

 MR. DAYS: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If they just read that, we 

have a case where the clearing organization didn't 

follow its rules the -- my client engaged in a 

transaction over the futures exchange.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Did I understand that 

correctly?

 MR. DAYS: Yes. I don't know, Justice 

Breyer, whether you're heading toward the concern that's 

expressed by the Respondents, namely that 25(b)(1) does 

not contain in that second part of the statute a 

reference to a --

JUSTICE BREYER: Clearing organization.

 MR. DAYS: -- clearing organization.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but then the 

response I'm going to ask them is, so what?

 MR. DAYS: Well, I think that is -- "so 

what" is a proper response, I'm glad you said it rather 

than I, that --

but I --

standing with respect to a transaction that occurred on 

the contract market even if the Respondents' argument is

persuasive that it didn't happen on the clearing 

organization or subject to the rules of the clearing 

organization.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be an argument 

for this case because that absence has been cured. 

Wasn't that in the 2000 amendment that -- that they 

changed the --

MR. DAYS: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the list to registered 

entity and which does include clearinghouse.

 MR. DAYS: Yes. Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So --

MR. DAYS: Yes?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The concern on the 

other side, I take it, is that it's not just limited to 

transactions on the exchange, but transactions subject 

to the rules of a contract market. And I understood 

you, in response to the hypothetical that Justice 

Kennedy posed, that you indicated that transaction has 

some substantive limit to it, and if that's the case, 

which seems to me an awfully large concession, then we 

have to figure out what the limit is. And it seems to 

me that it could just as easily be limited to the 

transaction between buyers and sellers of futures 

contracts as between all these subsidiary, ancillary,

collateral, whatever transactions that simply implement 

that broader transaction.

 MR. DAYS: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there 

are limitations with respect to 25(b)(1). As I 

indicated, nonparticipants in the market are not 

explicitly covered by this, but also one has to 

understand that there has to be a showing of bad faith 

and there are no punitive damages. There are actually 

damages and, therefore, this limits the extent to which 

this provision can be used by someone who is not within 

the category that I described.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Correct me if I'm wrong, 

but you're going to be more favorable to this than I 

expect your opponent. I mean, there is nothing really 

linguistically or otherwise wrong if you had a statute 

that said people in the badminton court have to play 

carefully. And if they hurt somebody on the 

merry-go-round, they are liable.

 And so people in the contract market have to 

play carefully, and if they have hurt somebody over at 

the futures exchange, they are liable.

 But it says those people in the futures 

exchange are people who engage in a transaction on the 

futures exchange.

 MR. DAYS: Yes, sir.

JUSTICE BREYER: And so they said well, by 

odd fluke of fate, your clients didn't. It was the --

rather, their client who actually went into the futures 

exchange and bought the commodity.

 Your point, I take it, is -- well that's 

true, but my client did something, he guaranteed that 

commodity transaction in accordance with the rules of 

the futures exchange, and that's what makes him a player 

in the futures exchange.

 MR. DAYS: Yes. As to him, yes --

JUSTICE BREYER: He --

MR. DAYS: -- that is right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: He guaranteed through the 

clearinghouse the payment of the contract made on the 

futures exchange --

MR. DAYS: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- which he didn't make, 

but he guaranteed it.

 MR. DAYS: Well, that's not correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: He made it.

 MR. DAYS: Well, that's not correct, Justice 

Breyer. The clearing --

JUSTICE BREYER: He didn't walk on to the 

floor and make it. It was his client who walked on to 

the floor and said whatever. Is that right?

MR. DAYS: Well, it's hard to know who walks 

on what floor. I think what is clear about this 

industry is that it is the clearing FCM who is always at 

the center of this, the essential participant in this 

entire process.

 The FCM's may not know who the customer is. 

They certainly don't know who the customer is on the 

other side. The clearinghouse doesn't know who the 

customer is, or the investor is. So the investor 

actually plays a very small role other than putting up 

his or her money at the beginning of the process.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I mean the --

the market is about investors. It's about buyers and 

sellers. Now, you're -- the clearinghouse and these 

FCM's may or may not be covered by the language of the 

statute, but it's an awful big stretch to say they are 

central to the market.

 What's central to the market are the 

investors. That's why they have these. They wouldn't 

have this market for -- for your clients, I mean for the 

clearinghouse or anything else. The market is there for 

the buyers and the sellers. That's the central 

transaction.

 MR. DAYS: We don't argue that investors are 

barred from bringing suits under 25(b)(1). They would

be persons who engaged in transactions on, or subject

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't Judge Friendly 

refer to the FCM as a central player or a principal in 

MR. DAYS: Yes. That -- that's certainly 

been the case in Leist where Judge Friendly wrote the 

opinion. And also --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the transaction --

what is the single transaction that you think brings 

your client within this language?

 MR. DAYS: Well, I mentioned --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the transaction, 

the guarantee?

 MR. DAYS: The one -- the contract market 

requires that the clearing FCM clear a contract with one 

hour -- assume the contract. So the assuming of the 

contract and the clearing required by the rules of the 

contract market is a violation of the CEA.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about what 

the rule is that was violated. It says "who engaged in 

any transaction on or subject to the rules of such 

contract market." What is, in brief, "the transaction" 

you're relying upon?

the transaction is the process of assuming this contract 

and then going toward the clearing -- clearing 

organization to clear it, and it's the clearing 

organization, setting the settlement price, which really 

dictates what happens on the clearing organization. So 

it's the setting of the settlement price which is the 

key point.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The transaction does not 

require two parties?

 MR. DAYS: Well, there are two parties here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You have a one-party 

transaction?

 MR. DAYS: There is a -- we can view this as 

one sole transaction, as one transaction with a number 

of subsidiary activities along the process between 

execution and consummation, or one can view various 

transactions that ultimately end up with the 

consummation of the contract.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why isn't it just --

MR. DAYS: I don't think it makes any 

difference one way or another.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the guarantee, the 

relationship between the clearing organization and the 

clearinghouse -- the clearing organization has to give a 

guarantee and has to put up margin?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER

 MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 For purposes of this case, the Court may 

assume that the word "transaction" in Section 25(b)(1) 

is limited to the purchase and sale of futures and 

options contracts.

 The Court may also assume that, in order to 

engage in such a transaction, a person must be a 

necessary and direct participant in the transaction. 

Even under those --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where do 

all of those assumptions come from? I would have 

thought the limitation of "transaction" beyond the plain 

language would be a significant concession in this case.

I mean --

MR. STEWART: When I say "assume," I am 

saying that the Court need not decide at this point how 

far, if at all, beyond the core transactions that occur 

on contract markets the statute breaches. That is, with 

respect to the hypothetical case of an exchange or a 

clearinghouse that has an anti-discrimination rule and 

is alleged to have violated that rule.

 Yes, on the one hand, you could say that in 

literal terms that is a transaction subject to the rules 

of the exchange. On the other hand, I think there is 

significant force to Respondents' contention that that 

seems very far afield from what was the core of 

Congress's concern. And with respect to the 

anti-discrimination hypothetical, there would also be 

the argument that there is a different Federal statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we have to figure 

out what was the core of Congress's concern and limit 

"transaction" in that way?

 MR. STEWART: I think the Court can at least 

start from the assumption that Congress referred to 

transactions on, or subject to, the rules of the 

contract market. And none of the things that have been 

posited in the hypotheticals, the anti-discrimination, 

would be transactions on a contract market.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they would be 

subject to the rules of the contract market.

 MR. STEWART: They would be subject to the 

rules. But our point here is that the United States and 

the CFTC have not had occasion to decide how far, if at 

all, beyond the core transactions on the contract market 

the statute extends.

 But our point is, even if we look at the 

core of what Congress was driving at, the buying and 

selling of futures options contracts, the clearing FCM 

is a proper plaintiff because it assumes direct 

contractual liability to the clearinghouse. Even before 

the clearing process is completed, it was defined as the 

buyer or seller of the contracts in the NYFE rules, and 

its participation is essential.

 Now -- now, we have a somewhat different 

conception of the relevant transaction than does the 

Petitioner. In our view, when Eisler executed his 

trades on the floor of the exchange, he set in motion a 

process that would quickly and inevitably culminate in 

the clearing of the trades by the clearing organization, 

and at the end of the day there would be an array of 

contractual relationships.

 Klein would have a contractal obligation to 

the clearinghouse. The clearing FCM on the other side

of the trade would have its own obligation to the 

clearinghouse. Klein would have an agreement with its 

customer, First West, that would entail rights and 

obligations running between them. And there would be a 

similar set of rights and obligations on the other side 

of the trade.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the argument 

that if we accept your view of it, allowing the FCM to 

sue, then there could be multiple liability?

 MR. STEWART: I think that's incorrect. I 

think the customer would also be an appropriate 

plaintiff, that is, the customer would have his own 

rights and obligations arising out of the -- the 

contract with the clearing FCM. But the fact that they 

might both be conceivable plaintiffs wouldn't mean that 

they could both recover in the same case.

 Remember that the statute limits recovery to 

actual losses. So if the customer here, Eisler and 

First West, had paid the required additional margin to 

Klein, and Klein had discharged its obligation to the 

clearinghouse, Klein would still be a person who had 

engaged in a transaction. But Klein wouldn't be able to 

recover because he would have suffered no actual losses.

 So it's the person who bears the actual loss 

at the end of the day who would be the appropriate

plaintiff.

 And the fact that in some cases that might 

be the customer and in other cases it might be the 

clearing FCM doesn't mean that there would be 

duplicative recovery in a single case.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, when you began by 

saying we could begin -- we could assume certain things, 

was it included in the things that we could assume --

was it the proposition that the transaction was limited 

to a purchase or sale?

 MR. STEWART: A purchase or sale, although 

we would extend -- I mean we would interpret the 

clearing process as part of the purchase or sale. And 

the reason we would do that is that clearing occurs 

inevitably by operation of law, as it were. That is, 

once Eisler executes his trades, Klein has no discretion 

as to whether to discharge its obligation to clear the 

trades.

 Klein had previously entered into a 

commitment to guarantee the trades that Eisler made. 

And, therefore, what -- Klein's obligations to the 

clearinghouse followed directly and inevitably from the 

initial trade on the floor of the exchange.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is that different from 

saying under the exchange rule the FCM is actually the

party that enters into the trade.

 MR. STEWART: I think it is a different 

thing and there are two different bases on which the 

Court could rule in our favor, that is, Rule 306(i)(2) 

of the rules of the exchange that were in effect at the 

time of these trades specified that -- and that's 

reproduced, I guess, at page 14a of the blue brief. And 

it said -- a second sentence of Rule 306(i)(2) says 

every such contract when made by a trading member shall 

be made on behalf of a clearing member, who shall be the 

buyer or seller of said contract on the terms set forth 

therein.

 So one way to rule for Klein in this case is 

to simply say even if we focus entirely on the moment at 

which the trade was executed, under the rules of the 

exchange, Klein was deemed to be the buyer or seller. 

But we are also making the different argument and in a 

sense we think the more important practical argument, 

that regardless of where the contract ran during the 

brief period before the clearing process was 

consummated, the salient factor is that at the 

conclusion of the clearing process, the clearinghouse 

would look directly and only to Klein for satisfaction 

of any obligations arising out of unsuccessful trades.

 In a sense the clearinghouse could be

analogized to a department store in which only the 

clearing members have charge accounts. And in order for 

anyone else to make a purchase, he has to make 

prearrangements with a charge account holder to have 

permission to charge things to his accounts. And that's 

essentially what was done here. In order for Eisler to 

execute trades on the floor of the exchange, he had to 

have the prior commitment from Klein that Eisler would 

be allowed to charge trades to client's account.

 And in that situation, we think it's 

entirely natural to say that Klein engaged in the 

transaction, even though Eisler was making the decisions 

as to exactly what trades to execute.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Stewart --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that why the Second 

Circuit was wrong in saying it was just like a 

securities broker?

 MR. STEWART: Yes. I think the Second 

Circuit's error was not really that it had a 

misconception of how narrow or broad the private right 

of action is. The Second Circuit's error was that it 

misunderstood the role that a clearing FCM plays in the 

process. The clearing FCM doesn't simply facilitate the 

formation of contracts between other people. The 

clearinghouse assumes direct contractual -- I'm sorry.

I mean the clearing FCM assumes direct contractual 

liability to the clearinghouse.

 And that's fundamental to the operation of 

the contract markets. That is, the point of the 

clearinghouse is to give investors assurance that if 

their trades are successful, they will get paid. And in 

order for the clearinghouse to pay the winners, it has 

to have confidence that it will be able to collect from 

the losers.

 And the way that it has that confidence is 

by identifying a small number of people, clearing FCM's, 

who have demonstrated financial wherewithal and 

integrity, and saying we are going to look only to you 

to satisfy these obligations. We are not going to put 

ourselves in the business of going after large, large 

numbers of individual investors to ensure that losing 

trades will be paid.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Stewart, may I go back 

to the question of multiple recoveries. And by that 

term, as I understand it, the term does not mean 

duplicating recoveries. And I don't understand -- and 

this is what I want you to explain -- why there couldn't 

be a recovery in a case analogous to this both by the 

FCM and by the ultimate customer.

 Let's assume that the settlement price is,

in fact, rigged. The FCM cannot meet the resulting 

margin call and folds, and hence a situation like this. 

And this happens quickly enough so that the ultimate 

transaction is never consummated. So that the -- the 

contracting party on the FCM side of the trade doesn't 

get the benefit of what would have been a favorable 

contract. Couldn't you have recovery in that case both 

by the customer and the FCM?

 MR. STEWART: I'm not sure if I -- if I 

fully understand the hypothetical.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It may be that I don't 

understand how it works.

 MR. STEWART: To answer a variant of it, I 

think there could be cases in which both the customer 

and the clearing FCM recovered something. That is, say 

there is a loss of a million dollars that's attributable 

to malfeasance by the exchange, and the customer comes 

up with half of that money -- $500,000. And the 

clearinghouse uses that to discharge half of its own 

obligation to the clearinghouse.

 Now, in that case, both the customer and the 

clearing FCM might have a cause of action for $500,000. 

So there would be -- there could be multiple recoveries 

in the sense that you're describing.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But in my hypo, the FCM is

claiming damages because his business folds. So the 

damages are not limited simply to those flowing from 

this transaction itself. The customer is claiming 

damages for failure to consummate a contract that would 

have been favorable to him.

 MR. STEWART: If you assume that 

consequential damage is arising out of the loss of the 

business --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. And I am 

assuming --

MR. STEWART: -- could be part of actual 

losses, then there would be no barrier to each party, 

the clearing FCM and the customer recovering what it 

actually lost.

 Our point is that there is no danger that 

because the clearing FCM is -- there is no danger that 

because the clearing FCM is liable for a million dollars 

to the clearinghouse and the customer is liable to the 

clearing FCM, each for a million dollars, that they will 

both get a million dollars. It's only the person who 

bears the actual loss.

ON BEHALF OF THE REPONDENTS

 MR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 I'd like to return to the language of the 

statute, because I think it explains why the comments 

that Mr. Stewart started with are, in fact, compelled by 

the language of the statute. 25 (a) talks about a 

person who engages in any transaction on or subject to 

the rules of a contract market. And I'm focusing on the 

"on or subject to the rules."

 If the Petitioners claimed in their opening 

brief any -- the fact that any transaction was governed 

by any rule, as in the Court's discrimination 

hypotheticals, was enough, then the "on" would be 

superfluous. There wouldn't be any need for "on", 

because surely a transaction on a contract market has to 

be governed by the rules of the contract market.

 So I think that shows why "on or subject to 

the rules of" is a term of art. It has a special 

meaning here. And the only kinds of transactions that 

are either on or subject --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but under that 

reading they should have used the word "and" rather than 

"or."

 MR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or which is subject to.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Justice Kennedy, I think 

what Congress was explaining there is it wasn't saying 

any transaction subject to the rules of a contract 

market, because that would be all of the Court's 

hypotheticals and discrimination and everything else, 

and the word "on" wouldn't be there. And so by using 

"on", which by definition "on" has to be subsumed in the 

rules because if a transaction is on a contract market, 

surely is in some way governed by a rule.

 So if Congress meant to cover every 

transaction that is in any way governed by a rule, it 

wouldn't have had to include "on."

 So the reason -- the fact that "on" is there 

means, as we discussed in our brief, that this is a 

special transaction on or subject to the rules singles 

out a very special category of transactions. And that 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I'm not 

following you. I think Justice Kennedy's question still 

applies. Your argument assumes that the "or" is an 

"and." I mean, you don't need to have a transaction 

"on" at all. It can be simply one subject to the rules.

 MR. PINCUS: Yes. But the fact that 

Congress put "on" in there means that it was trying to

capture something other --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The fact that 

Congress put "on" in there and then followed it with 

"or" means you don't have to worry what "on" means if 

you're subject to the rules of the contract market.

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. But I 

think the reason that "on" is there is that Congress was 

signaling that it wasn't, that the second part of the 

clause or "subject to the rules" didn't literally mean 

or subject to any rule, because if it literally meant 

that, there would have been no reason to include "on."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This is like ejusdem 

generis argument. You're saying, we should interpret 

"subject to the rules" in the same light that we 

interpret "transaction"?

 MR. PINCUS: No. This is an argument that 

on or subject to the rules that a transaction on or 

subject to the rules is a special kind of transaction. 

It's a term of art in the statute, and a term of art 

that refers to trades.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But even if it's a term of 

art, do you contend that client was not engaged in a 

transaction subject to the rules.

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, we do. Your Honor, our 

view is that the transaction that is referred to there

are the transactions that include, either at the trading 

pit or a small category of off pit trades that are 

permitted by Section C of the Commodities Exchange Act.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What is the scope of the 

term "transaction" in your view? What does it cover?

 MR. PINCUS: It covers the trade -- the 

contract that occurs at the pit at the moment -- during 

open when one --

JUSTICE STEVENS: In fact between either the 

buyer or the seller and the clearinghouse, not the 

clearinghouse, the FCM or whatever?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, FCMs may or may not be 

involved. In this case Klein wasn't involved, because 

Eisler was a floor, had floor privileges and he 

actually -- he was the person who was at the pit 

engaging in these transactions. So our -- our view is 

that the transaction, to start with that, either occurs 

at the pit when an offer is made, an open outcry, and 

it's accepted at that moment that transaction and --

the transaction?

transaction occurs --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But they are subject to 

liability if the transaction doesn't -- isn't 

consummated.

 MR. PINCUS: Under the rules of the clearing 

organization. Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the -- the buy and the 

sell contract will be worth nothing if it isn't cleared.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, it could -- what the 

clearing process does after the -- after that contract 

is formed is to eliminate, to provide a way to strip out 

the credit risk that ordinarily wouldn't be there.

you want us to say that the clearing is no part of the 

transaction, but the clearing is necessary to make a 

transaction go forward. Otherwise the contract is just 

a nullity.

 MR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor, we don't 

believe that the contract is a nullity. And in fact, if 

for example a he contract was made at the pit, and for 

some reason the -- the clearing member who was to clear 

the transaction went bankrupt that day and didn't exist, 

and therefore that transaction was not cleared, that 

transaction would still be enforceable as between the 

buyer and the seller.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So they had to pick it up 

in an hour.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, it has to be cleared in 

an hour to go through the clearing process.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. So therefore any 

transaction wouldn't happen in your hypothetical, 

because if I understand it correctly -- the buyer and 

the seller, who by the way are normally represented by 

clearing-houses by Klein, or by brokers like Klein, but 

in this case apparently they weren't -- they make the 

transaction in the pit and then the rules of the 

exchange say that the clearing-house has to pick it up, 

a clearing member within one hour, and at that point

that person -- the clearing member, the broker, I guess, 

this Klein type person -- becomes legally responsible 

for seeing that the money is put up.

 Now, it doesn't require a big stretch -- in 

fact, zero stretch, of the word transaction, to think 

that word transaction covers that entire process. From 

the moment -- and by the way the whole process is 

governed by the rules of the futures exchange -- so 

there are rules in there. So why do you -- what reason 

is there for taking that word transaction, cutting out 

about two-thirds of the important event, ignoring the 

fact that it is covered by the rule of the future 

exchange, and limiting it to the physical moment when 

somebody enters the pit in an unusual case and says "I 

buy for" -- and then another person says "I sell for"?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, let me first point out, 

Your Honor, it's not an unusual case. There frequently 

may be a case even where -- either where -- even where 

both sides are represented by floor brokers, where the 

floor broker who is -- who is representing the party in 

the trade is not the clearing member. That happens all 

the time and that's why the rules say that the clearing 

member doesn't have to even be designated until one hour 

after the trade. So hard to say that the clearing 

member engages in that transaction on the floor when

he -- when it may not be designated.

 The reason for the division is that Congress 

set out a clear rule here. The transaction it referred 

to, it used the language that it used elsewhere, as we 

discuss in our brief, particularly in defining the 

functions of floor trader and floor broker.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Pincus, if your view 

were correct it would have been so easy for Congress to 

say "buyers and sellers" or even "trade," but it used a 

word "transaction" that you say has a special meaning in 

this context, but "transaction" appears all through the 

law and usually it's a term that has encompassing 

meaning, like in the Federal rules "any transaction or 

occurrence," and you would say that Congress has given 

it here this very constrained meaning.

 MR. PINCUS: We do say that, Your Honor. 

Because -- let me address first your question about why 

Congress couldn't use buyer or seller. Here Congress 

had to -- needed a construction that would link the --

the transaction that was being targeted with the rules 

of the -- of the contract market, because that was going 

to be the test here, was it's all about whether or not 

contract market violated its rules, and so it needed a 

construction that referred to a transaction because 

those are the things that are governed by the rules of

the contract market that might be misapplied in the 

work -- in the way that A, B and C talk about.

 So it would have had to -- even if it had 

used the phrase, you know, "purchased" or "sold," a 

commodity for future delivery or an option on a contract 

for future delivery -- it would still have to say on or 

subject to the rules of a contract market, in order to 

link back to what it was doing, which was creating a 

cause of action for the violation of the contract 

markets own rules with respect to a transaction that was 

subject to those rules.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't it just say 

sustained by a buyer or seller? "Shall be liable for 

actual damages sustained by a buyer or seller." Why --

why would it need to be any more complicated than that?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, because it -- it would 

have to talk about --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: When everything else is 

the same, instead of "a person," just "buyer and 

seller."

 MR. PINCUS: Well, because then in the --

several lines down it talks about actual loss and it 

would have to say buyers and sellers there as well. And 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't know why.

MR. PINCUS: Well, it would be referring 

back to buyer or seller. But I think the key here is 

for Congress, given the structure of the act, "any 

transaction on or subject to the rules of the contract 

market" is -- are these transactions. Those are the 

only transactions that -- that meet that test. Those 

are the transactions, that very same phrase is used in 

defining the functions of the floor broker and the floor 

trader who execute the transactions on the floor, and so 

by using that phrase, Congress was tying back to 

something that it had a clear definition of. Let me --

JUSTICE ALITO: Where is the clear -- there 

is no clear definition. There is no definition 

whatsoever, anywhere, of "transaction."

 MR. PINCUS: Well, there is no definition of 

transaction, Your Honor, but in the definitions of floor 

trader and floor broker, the phrase "on or subject to 

the rules of a contract market" appears again in 

defining what they do, and so those are the people who 

are at the pit, either executing for their own account 

or for a customer's account, the trades. And so by 

using that very phrase in defining what they do -- which 

appears by the way on, in the discussion on pages 5 and 

6 --

in contracts subject to the rules -- are they persons

 MR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor, we don't -- we 

don't think they are, because they are acting as --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Who are subject to the 

rules in your view? It doesn't include the FCM, it 

doesn't include the broker, it doesn't include the 

trader.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, certainly a floor trader 

is because that's someone who is trading for his own 

account. A floor broker who's merely representing a 

customer is just like someone at a house closing, if you 

can't make the house closing you appoint someone to 

close the house. They aren't the ones who engage in the 

transaction; you do.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Neither are they the person 

who can end up personally liable, and -- I mean, they 

don't have -- they are not subject to margin calls. 

There is something very different about this set of 

relationships from the broker/seller relationship in 

buying and selling a house.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, those people also have --

well, the -- the floor broker is not subject to a margin 

call. He is subject to liability for other things that 

he may do wrong, but for his role as a floor broker he

is not subject to margin responsibility.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You recognize that the 

Second Circuit was wrong when it said that this FCM is 

just like a securities broker. He is just making a deal 

for a commission. It seems to me that that -- that was 

not proper.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, if that was 

all the Second Circuit said, I would agree with you that 

would be wrong, but the Second Circuit recognized that 

the -- Klein here had a risk, a credit risk because it 

had backed up the credit of its customer, Eisler, and 

that's why in the lessons learned report that the CFTC 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not just Klein. 

It's every FCM. That is the job of an FCM.

 MR. PINCUS: That is the job of the clearing 

member of what an FCM does.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that's not -- not 

comparable to just a broker who executes my order for 

shares and gets a commission for it.

 MR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor, but as the 

Second Circuit went on to note, the fact that there is a 

credit risk here, that Klein is taking a risk based on 

the credit of his customer Eisler -- as the CFTC noted, 

there is nothing in the rules that require clearing

members to only accept minimum margin, and it's the job 

of a clearing member to -- to look into both the 

credit-worthiness of its customers and the risks of the 

various transactions that are open and demanding more 

margin.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I was under the impression 

from the briefs, and maybe I'm wrong, that you did not 

defend the reasoning of the Second Circuit. Am I right 

or wrong?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, we don't -- to the extent 

Petitioners claim that the Second Circuit based its 

reasoning on -- on the imputation into 25(b) of the 

limitations in 25(a), we don't agree with that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Which was the principal 

basis for its decision.

 MR. PINCUS: But there was a second basis to 

its decision, which talked about the fact that Klein 

didn't engage in trading, and we agree with that basis 

because that's what we're arguing here.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on that subject and 

you -- your client obviously has an institutional 

interest in the case, assuming you don't prevail, is the 

government's theory much broader and more undesirable in 

your view than that offered in Klein brief? I didn't

government's position.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, it -- it certainly would 

be better if the phrase "transaction on or subject to 

the rules of the contract market" meant "trade" and we 

were only discussing how expansive, how elastic the 

definition of "trade" was.

 We would still take the position that it's 

not elastic enough obviously to include clearing 

members, but we think that, given the language that 

Congress used and the fact that that language is used to 

refer to that "on or subject to" formulation is 

repeatedly used to refer to trades, we think it's very 

clear that trades have to be what it is. Otherwise, 

when the statute talks about the fact that a floor 

broker engages in activities on or subject to the rules 

of a contract market, it could be talking about 

discrimination and all kinds of other activities. But 

even with respect to the narrower formulation urged by 

the Solicitor General, we think that it is not right for 

several reasons: First of all the language of the 

statute, as I said, but there's a clarity problem. If 

once you move beyond that contract that is executed and 

becomes complete on the pit, how far do you go? There's 

clearing before the contract is executed on the pit --

at the pit. There may be antecedent activities -- for

example, someone who doesn't have floor privileges has 

to go through an FCM. There may be an introducing 

broker that introduces that customer to the FCM or all 

of those activities which are specified in the statute 

just like the subsequent clearing activity is specified 

in the statute. Are they also shoe-horned into the 

definition of trade?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Pincus --

MR. PINCUS: And that's where --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice Kennedy was 

asking you about the government's position. One of the 

positions -- one aspect of the government's position is 

that -- that you would not dispute that a person who 

engaged in a transaction subject to the rules of a 

clearinghouse would be a proper plaintiff under the 

current law. Well, certainly the FCM is a person 

subject to the rules of a clearinghouse.

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, although obviously the 

parties haven't briefed the current law. We would take 

the position that the current law doesn't change the 

equation and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what I thought 

your position was. So that's not an accurate.

 MR. PINCUS: No.

MR. PINCUS: No. Our position is, again, 

the "on or subject to" language, we believe, quite 

clearly refers to trades and that Congress's technical 

correct substitution of registered entities doesn't 

change that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you're saying that 

because a trade is on or subject to, the only thing that 

can be on or subject to is a trade. And it seems to me 

that that -- that's the point at which we have 

difficulty following your argument. Why -- what is your 

reason, textual or otherwise, for saying that because a 

trade is on or subject to, no other subtransaction can 

be on subject to?

 MR. PINCUS: Because -- because trades are 

the only thing that fit those two criteria. Only trades 

are -- can be under the statute either on the contract 

market, either because -- because they are executed at 

the pit or so-called off-market trades as referred to in 

Section 6(c) -- very small categories of off-market 

transactions --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But even if the --

MR. PINCUS: -- that are the equivalent of 

trades but can occur off-market.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Pincus, even if 

you limit it to the word "trades," it does not

necessarily follow that the only parties to the trade 

are the original buyer and the original seller. There 

are two intermediates who participate in the execution 

of the trade.

 MR. PINCUS: I agree, Your Honor, and that's 

the second part of our argument. Once we reach the 

point where it's trade, then the question is what does 

trade mean? And --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Does it include this 

transaction?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, we believe that it --

there are -- at the pit, again, that the transaction, 

the on transaction, the transaction that occurs on, is 

the open outcry transaction where, in this case, Eisler 

made an offer and some other floor trader accepted it, 

and that was complete there. Klein has no role in that 

transaction, and clearing members do not have a role in 

that transaction.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why do you say --

MR. PINCUS: They come in later.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why do you say that Klein 

had no role in it? It was an indispensable party to the 

transaction.

 MR. PINCUS: It was a subsequent party. It 

had subsequent role --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Before it was completed he

 MR. PINCUS: Well, it was not -- it need not 

be clear at the moment of that the trade is executed at 

the pit who the clearing member will be. Often it won't 

be.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It was cleared by the time 

it was over.

 MR. PINCUS: No -- well, it depends what you 

mean by "over," Your Honor. What happens in the 

process, if I can just lay it out for one minute, is the 

transaction occurs at the pit. It's recorded. The 

clearing member --

JUSTICE STEVENS: There is no distinction 

between A and D, but before it can be consummated B and 

C have to play a role.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, that activity is over. 

I'll try to use neutral words. That activity at the pit 

is over. The next -- that data, who bought, who sold, 

and maybe the clearing members for those two parties are 

identified. Maybe they're not. They might not be 

identified for an hour according to the rules. So 

something happened at the pit. It's then entered into 

the computers, and at some subsequent point, yes, the 

clearing members will be identified and the trade will

be cleared.

 Our point is that is subsequent activity. 

That is activity -- that's the clearing process. It's 

important, but there is enforceable contract before the 

clearing event occurs. Nothing in the rules say that 

the contract is unenforceable.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's true, but is there 

any reason that the word "transaction" would have --

serves a purpose by being so limited?

 MR. PINCUS: It does, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what Congress would 

Congress have wanted to do that?

 MR. PINCUS: In -- because in the 

environment that Congress was operating just following 

this Court's decision in Curran, the focus entirely was 

on protecting investors.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's not a reason. I 

want to know what reason, what harm will be done if in 

fact we take the word "transaction" and say the word 

"transaction," while it's capable of the interpretation 

you give, is also capable of an interpretation that 

includes all the near contemporaneous events, including 

the financing and guarantees? Like a mortgage in 

selling a house.

linguistically possible. What harm will be done --

MR. PINCUS: The harm that will --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- if the second is chosen 

and not the first?

 MR. PINCUS: The harm -- two categories of 

harm: First, a lack of clarity. We don't know, as I 

said, how far back are we going. The statute requires, 

for customers that are not trade, not exchange members, 

they have to go to an introducing broker. They have to 

go then to an FCM.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the only one that has 

this relationship that's different from an ordinary 

broker, the only one is the FCM.

 MR. PINCUS: But that's true, Your Honor, 

but if the Court were to adopt a rule that says we're 

going to read "transaction" broadly, and so anyone who 

has anything to do with any aspect of the trade, either 

before it or afterward, is covered, all of these 

antecedent people, just in terms of the statutory 

language, are people who have a role.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they're not people 

who are at risk. I mean if there -- if it's a broker 

who was just executing a trade for a commission is not 

at risk, but this FCM is at risk, in this transaction,

series of transactions.

 MR. PINCUS: But it's hard to see in the 

language where Congress would have drawn the line. I 

think the problem is the lack of clarity. We certainly 

won't know, if the Court says we are going to move 

beyond this core transaction and encompass some of the 

ancillary activities --

JUSTICE BREYER: I got that.

 MR. PINCUS: Okay.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I got that when you said 

there were two. What's the second?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, let me just add to the --

to the first that there are subsequent activities. 

There also are arrangements set up with banks that 

automatically supply margins, that facilitate 

transactions. And so the question will be, aren't those 

banks who play an important liquidity role, aren't they 

part of a transaction?

 The second reason is the reason involved --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The answer would be 

that those transactions are not subject to the rules of 

the exchange.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, they are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They don't care what 

kind of arrangement the FCM might have with its bank.

That's up to the FCM. There's no exchange --

MR. PINCUS: But it has to have an 

arrangement, and that fact is a rule of the exchange.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there some --

MR. PINCUS: So it depends what rule. 

Again, we're --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Pincus --

MR. PINCUS: -- on the rule where we're not 

going to know what the answer is.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the agency that's 

supposed to be the supervisor of this area, the CFTC, is 

taking the position that the government presented to us 

today. Apparently, it doesn't have the concern that you 

have just expressed about reaching people who are not 

themselves subject to the regulation of the exchange, 

the clearinghouse.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, I think it does have that 

concern, Justice Ginsburg, which is why Mr. Stewart said 

that the Court should sort of take this case on certain 

assumptions because, as he recognized, the theory that 

even the government put forward in its brief --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that what he 

was telling us was that, even if you assume that Klein 

has that, even if you've assume that.

position that Klein has standing, but in terms of the 

consequences of a ruling by the Court that the statute 

goes beyond the core activity, I think the government's 

suggestion sort of shows that even the government is not 

sure, once you embark on that exercise, where the 

boundary line is. And I would point out the government 

is not asking for deference in this case nor could it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you still 

owe Justice Breyer his second reason.

 MR. PINCUS: I do, Your Honor, and the 

second reason is involved in the government's response 

to Justice Souter's question about multiple recoveries.

 If all of these various people can assert 

claims, then there is certainly a risk, and a 

significant risk, that all of these various people will 

assert different kinds of monetary harm that they will 

claim is actual loss.

 In this case the principal, actual loss, as 

we discussed in the second argument in our brief, is 

claimed as the loss from the destruction, allegedly 

caused from the destruction, of Klein's business.

 If there was a bad-enough event on an 

exchange, all of the people in this -- in the row from 

the introducing broker down to the end, down to the 

bank, could claim that, because there was a foul-up in

the electronic reporting system and trades were 

misreported for a week and, when they were unwound, the 

consequences of that where lots of bankruptcies in the 

futures industry, that all of those liabilities get 

pegged to the contract market. As -- as the FIA --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Aren't there lots of 

situations in which a various -- serious -- harms a 

whole bunch of people, and they all recover?

 MR. PINCUS: There are, Justice Stevens, but 

this is a particular kind of industry. As the -- as the 

Futures Industry Association notes in its brief, every 

day more than $5 trillion worth of contracts are traded 

on futures exchanges. There is a huge amount of 

concentrated risk in contract markets.

 If the contract markets are going to be made 

liable to a vast array of people, there is a very 

serious risk that financial jeopardy --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You would agree if the 

client had been trading on its own account with a 

scalper, it would have been able to recover for the --

for its loss to itself; right?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, if it had been trading for 

its own account.

and some for other customers, it only can recover half

of those. Does that make sense?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, it does, because Klein is 

a market insider.  It has ways to protect itself other 

than suing the contract market.

 It can certainly sue its customer. It has 

ways of protecting itself, as the CFTC report said, in 

terms of demanding more margin, in terms of watching the 

risk in its customer's portfolio, in terms of -- of 

hedging its own risk. It's an insider, and it can do 

that.

 What Congress was concerned with here -- and 

the reason our construction of the statute makes sense 

-- is that it protects the outsiders, the PC investors 

who are at the core of the concern here, without 

imposing a broad array of liability on the contract 

markets, who are in the middle of a huge, huge amount of 

financial risk, which really puts them in the position 

of shouldering risk that's intolerable.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there instances where 

multiple parties who are injured sue under state law, or 

is this generally deemed preemptive, or it just doesn't 

happen, or --

MR. PINCUS: Well, there are options. I 

mean one of the things that Klein says here is that this 

is its only option. It can go to the FTC.

In this case, for example, the FTC order 

against Eisler assessed a civil penalty but then said 

the order could be -- it said that obligation could be 

fufilled by paying the injured parties. Klein -- to the 

extent Klein has an injury, the FTC -- the CFTC in a 

similar case could do the same thing. There are state 

law claims. There are --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Pincus, will you 

satisfy me on one point. I -- I understand your 

argument about what "transaction" means. But even if I 

accept that argument, explain to me again why "or 

subject to the rules" doesn't add anything?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, it does. It adds -- in 

our construction "the transactions that are on" are the 

transactions that occur on the floor. The transactions 

that are "subject to the rules" are the ex-pit 

transactions.

 Once you say "or subject to the rules" 

involves more than ex-pit trades, off-exchange trades, 

then you're into the world of the Court's hypotheticals 

to Mr. Days of anti-discrimination rule.

 So it has to have a limited meaning; and, by 

coupling it with "on," we think that Congress made clear 

it was referring to trades.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't it have been

enough to just say "transactions on" if that was their 

meaning? Why did -- did they --

MR. PINCUS: Because then you wouldn't 

capture a category -- because then Congress would have 

left out a category of trades. Congress meant to 

capture investors who trade. There are two categories 

of transactions that meet that test: Those that occur 

on the exchange, on the -- physically on the pit, and 

those that are within the industry called off-exchange 

or off-pit transactions defined in Section 6(c) of the 

act -- of the -- of the statute.

 And so by -- the second phrase is meant to 

capture those trades that may involve investors but 

don't occur at the pit.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I take if -- if your 

ultimate, let's say, policy reason for confining it to 

that is the -- is the policy against multiple recovery.

 MR. PINCUS: Yes. The policy reason is the 

risk of multiple recoveries in an area where there is a 

huge amount of risk. The contract market is at the 

center of things, of these $5 trillion a day. And so 

Congress wrote very carefully, and Congress's focus was, 

in the wake of Curran -- and given what it said -- was 

investors.

 Because the -- the implied cause of action

that the Court recognized in Curran was all about 

investors. The rationale --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Their current argument is, 

basically, that's all Congress was thinking about.

 MR. PINCUS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But, as I understand your 

position, it's something more. Congress was also 

thinking probably about multiple recovery, and it didn't 

want that. And we will impute that intent to Congress 

because multiple recovery would be a very bad thing for 

the industry. That's basically your argument.

 MR. PINCUS: Yes. That is our argument.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. PINCUS: Um, let me say a word about the 

rules and whether the rules are relevant here. It seems 

to us that Congress used a phrase in the statute, and 

that it -- that that cannot be changed by a rule that 

says -- if an exchange adopted a rule that said some 

transaction was on, or subject to, the rules of it, that 

wouldn't be enough to put it into the statutory 

language. The test is what Congress meant. Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Pincus. Mr. Days, you have a minute.

MR. DAYS: Your Honors, Mr. Pincus has 

identified what he views as some temporal gap between 

the entering into a contract and the involvement of this 

-- the clearing FCM. That simply is not the case.

 Klein had a prior commitment to clear 

Eisler's trade; so even at the time that Eisler was 

trading, that had to be done with the understanding that 

Klein was going to back him up.

 If one looks at the gray brief at page 21, 

it references to the rule of Knight -- rules of Knight 

116 and 118 that make this very clear. The story is, as 

we've indicated, that throughout this process the 

clearing FCM is financially liable and, therefore, is on 

the hook.

 When Congress enacted the statute, it was 

concerned with protecting the public and maintaining 

credibility. We think that this cause of action, this 

express cause of action for allowing FCMs to sue, is 

most reliant to the objectives of Congress: The 

faithful execution by an FCM that deals directly with 

these entities, the clearinghouse and the commodity 

contract market. Thank you very much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Days. 

The case is submitted.
