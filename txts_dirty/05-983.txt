 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

this morning in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City 

School District. Mr. Andre.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. ANDRE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This case asks the Court to decide to what 

extent non-lawyer parents of a child with a disability 

may litigate an IDEA case pro se in Federal court. 

Under two distinct theories, the answer to that question 

should be without limitation. But I would like to focus 

today on petitioner's primary and first theory, which is 

that parents are real parties in interest in IDEA suits 

regardless of the claims being asserted.

 Under 28 USC 1654, a party has a right as a 

matter of Federal statutory law to litigate their own 

case. Accordingly, when a parent sues under IDEA, it is 

our position they are suing in their own right and are 

suing on their own case. This is particularly so 

because the right to sue provision that Congress enacted 

in IDEA uses the broad phrase "any party aggrieved" when 

it allows judicial review of an adverse administrative

hearing officer's decision. The parties agree that it 

is the underlying administrative complaint or the due 

process complaint that frames both the claims that can 

be brought eventually in court, and also identifies who 

the parties are that can appear in court.

 Those complaint provisions in IDEA, and 

there are eight of them in all we cite in footnote seven 

of our reply brief; all eight of those provisions refer 

unambiguously to the parents' complaints. Congress did 

not describe this due process complaint that starts the 

whole dispute process as the child's complaint, the 

child's complaint by and through the parents, or the 

parents' complaint on behalf of the child.

 Accordingly, when a parent files that due 

process complaint, they are the real party in interest, 

and again, the provisions make no distinctions about the 

kinds of claims that can be brought. It shouldn't 

matter that when they get to Federal court that -- or 

there shouldn't be any limitation on who is the real 

party in interest in Federal court, or what claims may 

be asserted.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we say that the parents 

are the real party in interest and are entitled to sue 

in their own right, is that the end of the case, or do 

we reach the second -- a second question as to whether

or not they can represent the children?

 MR. ANDRE: I don't think you would need a 

reach a second question, Justice Kennedy. It's our 

position that the remedies in an IDEA case are 

co-extensive and that the rights are inseparable. And 

so, this case was pleaded in such a way as to have both 

the parents and the child be before the court. But if 

this court were to agree with us on our first and 

primary theory, we don't believe it would be necessary 

to have the child listed as a plaintiff to a future 

suit, and we imagine that on remand the child might be 

dismissed from the suit. It's our position that he's 

not an indispensable party.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What can the parents get 

out of this case other than reimbursement for the 

tuition they've paid to private schools and procedural 

rights that are given them by the Act? What can they 

get out of this case other than those two things that do 

not depend upon their status as representatives of the 

child?

 MR. ANDRE: Well, clearly the relief 

primarily sought by my clients -- in fact, if you look 

just at the relief section of the complaint that my 

clients filed, which is in joint appendix, page 19, the 

only relief they actually seek is reimbursement.

There's a number of ways --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What other possible relief 

could they seek other than giving them a procedural 

right accorded by the Act? What other possible relief 

could they seek that they would not be seeking as 

guardians of the child?

 MR. ANDRE: Of course, it's our position 

that parents are never acting as guardians, at least in 

the legal sense, or lay representatives of a child in a 

court action. And so, therefore, a parent should be 

able to assert any one of the -- a claim asserting 

violation of any one of the many rights conferred in the 

Act.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends upon their being 

a party aggrieved. That is defined in Black's Law 

Dictionary as a party entitled to a remedy.

 MR. ANDRE: Correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now if the only remedies 

the parents are entitled to in their own right are 

reimbursement, which is at issue here, and procedural 

guarantees, why would not their ability to sue or to 

appear pro se be limited to those two categories? You'd 

win this case, but I'm talking about how broad is the 

rule that you're urging us to adopt?

 MR. ANDRE: Well, in -- and this could be a

very easy case if the Court wants to look just at the 

specific procedural violations that my clients assert 

and also the reimbursement claim that they assert. But 

it's of course our position also that the full bundle of 

rights can be asserted by parents. I think maybe the 

best way to answer your question, Justice Scalia, is 

that -- to direct you back to the definition of a free 

appropriate public education itself, and that's in 

1401(9) and (29) in the statute. That definition 

provides that a free appropriate public education is one 

that's provided at no cost to parents. So if a school 

district provides a free and inappropriate public 

education, then it's the parents' obligation -- or not 

obligation -- they have the choice of whether to 

supplement the inappropriate public education with 

additional services, or to replace the public education 

with one that provides an appropriate bundle of 

services.

 So I guess my point is that even in a case 

where the parents don't necessarily seeks reimbursement, 

they still are intended beneficiaries of the right to a 

free appropriate --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The child is. The child is 

entitled to an appropriate public education and the 

parents are entitled to have it provided free. That's

really the only interest they have on the table, it 

seems to me, separate and apart from their status as 

representatives or guardians of the child.

 MR. ANDRE: We also believe that the parents 

have an interest in the education being appropriate 

for -- in addition to the reason I just explained, that 

they may have to supplement education, but parents are 

also the co-architects of the individualized educational 

program that is eventually -- that eventually defines 

the bundle of services that it provides the child. And 

they're integral to the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say 

they're the co-architects. I mean, are you saying 

anything more than they are given the procedural right 

to participate in the hearing?

 MR. ANDRE: I think they're given -- I 

haven't counted them -- but I think they're given 10, 12 

of the 15 procedural rights outlined in the statute. 

And this Court explained in Rowley, Congress placed 

every bit as much emphasis on parental involvement in 

the shaping of the individualized educational program --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't there a bit 

of -- there's a leap from saying they have these various 

procedural rights and they're are a party aggrieved by 

the decision rendered after the hearing, that's a

different question, isn't it?

 MR. ANDRE: Well, typically a parent would 

file a due process complaint, challenging the bundle of 

services offered by the school district, and alleging a 

procedural violation. And so I think it would be a rare 

case where a parent would, by the time they get to 

Federal court, try to be a party aggrieved is something 

that they didn't exhaust -- that would render the 

exhaustion requirement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They are an aggrieved 

party for purposes of the administrative process. The 

question is whether that -- when that is done, whether 

they also constitute an aggrieved party. And one of 

the -- one of the points made by the other side is that 

there is an express provision for proceeding without 

counsel at the administrative level, and there's no 

provision for proceeding without counsel in court.

 So doesn't that suggest that the right to 

proceed pro se is limited to the administrative process?

 MR. ANDRE: No, not at all, 

Justice Ginsburg. Congress sensibly recognized that 

because the process proceedings are run on a State by 

State basis, certain unauthorized practice of law 

statutes or other laws require prohibiting counsel in 

administrative proceedings might come into play. So

Congress had to make it express in section 1415(h)(1) 

that any party may appear in the administrative 

proceedings with or without counsel.

 In contrast, in Federal court, there's 

already 28 U.S.C. 1654, which has been on the books 

since 1789 as part of the Judiciary Act. That provision 

allows any party to litigate their own case. So it 

actually makes a lot of sense that Congress would have 

included the express right to proceed pro se --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which just begs the 

question, doesn't it? I mean, you're assuming that the 

parents are a party to the case in Federal court.

 MR. ANDRE: Well, again, it is our position 

that they are because they're parties aggrieved by the 

administrative proceedings, so long as they have 

exhausted their claims. And that this is confirmed in 

other provisions, for example, the attorneys' fees 

provision of the statute refers repeatedly to parents as 

a possible prevailing party.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought it was the 

unanimous view of the circuits that parents, as a 

general matter, do not have the right to represent their 

children in Federal court, that the provision of the 

judicial code that you cited does not confer on parents, 

generally, the right to represent children.

MR. ANDRE: That's correct, Mr. Chief 

Justice. But our primary theory in this case is not 

that parents are seeking to represent their children as 

lay advocates in court. Our primary theory is that a 

parent suing under the statute is suing in their own 

right. In fact, that's why my clients pleaded this case 

with -- as -- with themselves on the caption, and 

asserted claims that are their own, because they 

believed that those claims are their own, and they 

believed they should be able to litigate those claims 

under section 1654.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, it's not an 

insignificant matter at issue here. Counsel, who are 

referred to as officers of the court, protect the court 

from frivolous suits, from suits that really have no 

basis. When we give that authority to appear in court 

and initiate a suit to the public at large, we make a 

lot more work for Federal district judges. Why should 

we interpret this statute to achieve that unusual 

result?

 MR. ANDRE: Well, I'm not sure that the 

policy considerations would be relevant to the statutory 

construction question of whose rights are being asserted 

in a case like this. But certainly under our second 

theory, the public policy considerations would be

appropriate.

 It is our position that those public policy 

concerns about pro se litigants burdening the court, 

burdening opposing counsel are dramatically outweighed 

by the fact that -- by the reality that two-thirds of 

the disabled children in the United States come from 

families that cannot afford counsel --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The statute already 

allows the shifting of fees to a prevailing party. So 

presumably attorneys can be found to take the 

meritorious cases. And What we are probably dealing 

with are cases that can't attract attorneys, even though 

the attorneys know that if they win, they will get their 

fees.

 MR. ANDRE: Two responses Mr. Chief Justice. 

First, in other regimes, where you have a fee-shifting 

statute, the cases are usually still brought by pro se 

litigants. Here because you are dealing with a minor 

child, really, it is an all or nothing proposition. 

Either bring the case and you have the potential to 

recover attorneys' fees, or the case doesn't get brought 

at all. And this is borne out by the statistics cited 

in our position and the amicus briefs from the Council 

of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, and the Autism 

Society of America.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was their an argument at 

any point in this case that the claim was frivolous?

 MR. ANDRE: No, there was not. And then 

that brings me to my last point, which is, as a 

practical matter, there is a very limited private 

special ed bar and they cherry-pick only the best cases. 

But that doesn't mean that all the cases that are left 

are frivolous or meritless. There's a whole universe of 

cases out there, some of which may be quite strong, some 

of which may be on the borderline, and some which may be 

meritless.

 But Congress cannot have intended to create 

this important and robust substantive statutory 

guarantee to a free and appropriate public education, 

and guarantee all these procedural safeguards, including 

judicial review to enforce it, and then expect that that 

right would never be fulfilled because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if they had 

that overriding intent, it would have been easy enough 

for them to make clear that this was an exception to the 

normal rule, that parents don't have the right to 

represent children in court. They did that with respect 

to the administrative proceeding, as Justice Ginsburg 

pointed out. They perhaps conspicuously did not do it 

with respect to the proceeding in court.

MR. ANDRE: Well, actually, if I could 

clarify one thing. If you look closely at section 

1415(h)(1), it does not provide that a parent can 

represent their child in the administrative proceeding. 

It just says that any party may litigate that 

administrative proceeding.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know, but 14 -- is 

it 1415(f)? Specifically says that parents have the 

right to participate in the due process hearing. I'm 

looking at 1415(f)(1)(A). In other words, parents have 

the right to participate in the due process hearing.

 MR. ANDRE: But that's also -- our position 

is they have the right to participate in the due process 

hearing as parties, in fact as the kind of plaintiff 

side parties. And that is confirmed by the provisions 

that we cite in footnote seven of our reply brief that 

talk about the parents' complaint.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't say they 

have the right to participate as parties. They have --

it says they have the right to -- for an impartial due 

process hearing. I would suppose if you're trying to 

figure out who is the party to that case, you would 

still think of it in terms of the child and not the 

parents.

 MR. ANDRE: Well, we thought that -- we

believe that Congress thought of it as the parents 

because of all the statutory references to the parents' 

complaint. Of course, we don't take the absurd position 

that the child could not also be a party to those 

proceedings.

 But in any event, my point was simply that 

the express Lesesne argument that some courts relied on 

to suggest that Congress consciously decided not to 

allow parental lay representation, I mean, that argument 

simply doesn't have a strong foundation, because the 

provision on which that argument is based, which is 

1415(h)(1), is ambiguous at best. And, in fact, could 

suggest just the opposite.

 I'd like to address a point that Respondents 

have relied on --

JUSTICE ALITO: Before you do that, how much 

of a practical benefit would it be for children with 

disabilities and their parents, if you are successful 

here, in light of the complexity of the IDEA and the 

fact that this is an area where some parents are going 

to have difficulty maintaining any kind of emotional 

detachment from the litigation?

 If parents can represent their -- can -- a 

non-lawyer parent can appear in court, isn't there a 

risk that in some instances where a lawyer could be

found if the parent made an effort to do that, they're 

going to be lured into trying to provide the 

representation themselves?

 MR. ANDRE: Well, first of all, parents 

already have to get to know the statute and the 

applicable regulations when they bring these cases at 

the administrative level. By the time they get to 

court, they are intimately familiar with the facts and 

intimately familiar with the relevant law. The only 

thing that's different about the court action and the 

administrative proceeding is now you have the Federal 

Rules of Civil Procedure.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: These disadvantaged parents 

that you are referring to who comprise the majority of 

parents, they're really up on section, you know, (h)(1) 

and all that stuff? I find that hard to believe. I 

mean, the people you're assertedly benefiting here are 

the people least likely to have familiarized themselves 

with the statute and the procedures.

 MR. ANDRE: I'm not sure we agree, with all 

due respect, Justice Scalia. But even if that's true, 

the nature of IDEA court action, I think, addresses some 

of the concern. These are not pure record review 

proceedings, like in merit systems protection board 

cases, or immigration cases. But they are quasi review

proceedings. And so what we're advocating here is 

really access to the courts. Let the parents, whether 

they are brilliant writers or they're not so good at 

writing, let them at least have access to the courts, so 

that will then -- a capable district judge can look at 

the case and decide whether the school should have 

complied with the statutory mandates.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And do it right after 

reading pro se prisoner petitions, right? You'd have a 

nice evening's work.

 MR. ANDRE: We think that the pro se parents 

are quite different from pro se prisoners. I'd like to 

save the rest of my time for rebuttal.

 That is the claim that's at issue in this 

case, and the parents are clearly the appropriate party 

for that claim because they're the ones that have 

incurred the financial harm. When they are reimbursed 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That argument proves 

a little too much. If you have a child who is the 

victim of a tort, for example, and suffers a serious 

injury, it is the parents who are going to have to bear 

the costs of accommodating that injury. And yet in any 

tort action, it's still the child who is the party and 

not the parent.

 MR. SALMONS: Well, I think that's right, 

Your Honor, but the difference here is that the statute 

in section 1412(a)(10)(C)(2), and this is on page 6A of 

Petitioner's brief, expressly provides a right to 

parents to seek reimbursement for the -- for their --

the educational expenses that they incur.

 And while the parents have to show that 

there was a denial of a free appropriate public 

education, we think it's clear that the statute makes

the claim the parent's claim. And there are cases, for 

example, out of the Fourth District, in Emery, that 

would suggest that it is not even clear that the child 

would have standing to assert a claim for reimbursement 

when they're not out of pocket any expenses.

 So we think in a case like this, this is an 

easy case. We think clearly here the parents are the 

parties.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you would be 

establishing a right for the least needy. I mean, if 

they're seeking reimbursement, they're able to pay the 

private school tuition. It's the people who can't --

who have no alternative, they have to take what the 

school district gives them because they don't have the 

wherewithal to enroll their child in a private school. 

And your argument, concentrating on the reimbursement 

right, would leave out those people, would it not?

 MR. SALMONS: Well, that's not the sum total 

of our argument, Your Honor. I was just pointing out 

that actually there's a relatively narrow way to decide 

this case if the Court so chose, by focusing on the 

reimbursement claim in this case.

 Our position is that parents share in the 

substantive right to a free appropriate public education 

under the Act. And there are two things we would point

to in regard to the definition of a free appropriate 

public education that we think makes this clear. And 

this is in section 1401 of the Act on pages 2A and 4A of 

Petitioner's brief.

 The first is the definition says that the 

term free appropriate public education means special 

education services provided, quote, without charge and 

at no cost to parents. We think clearly the free 

aspect, again, is first and foremost a right of the 

parents, because they're the ones that bear the cost. 

With regard to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not following you. 

Where is this provision? 1401 what?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you quoted from 

4(a).

 MR. SALMONS: There's -- That's correct. 

The definition begins on page 2(a) "which says free 

appropriate public education on section 1401 and it 

says, "the term free appropriate public education means 

special education related services that -- and under 

subparagraph A have been provided at public expense 

under public supervision and direction and without 

charge -- Then in subparagraph 29 on page 4(a)the term 

special education is defined which is again the term 

from the definition of free appropriate public

education, is defined to mean "specially designed 

instructions at no cost to parents."

 And so again the right to a free appropriate 

public education is defined expressly in part as terms 

of the parents interest. We also think that regards to 

any question about what is the appropriate, if you look 

back again on 2(a), subparagraph D of the definition of 

free appropriate public education, it says that it has 

to be special education services that are provided in 

conformity with the individual education program 

required under the Act.

 And now the individual education program or 

IEP process is the process by which parents are given 

the right to participate as full members of the IEP team 

and to have a say in helping to define what is an 

appropriate education for the child. And as this Court 

pointed out in Rowley, this is the essential feature of 

this Act. The way it works is that Congress did not 

specify or flesh out a substantive standard for what is 

appropriate for a child' instead it ensured -- it 

mandated, excuse me -- that an appropriate education is 

an education that involves parental involvement.

 And when there is a dispute with regard to 

whether the IEP team has adopted the right educational 

program for the child, we think that the Act makes

parents, who again, who are full members of that team, 

when their views are rejected as far as what is 

appropriate, they are given the procedural safeguard of 

initiating a due process hearing. Again the Act refers 

repeatedly to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So their, their 

rights -- so their right to proceed in Federal court 

should be limited to the rights that you've identified 

under the statute as opposed to the right to proceed on 

behalf of the child?

 MR. SALMONS: That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, you 

think -- you think their -- their, their rights -- the 

rights they can assert are only ones they can identify 

as their own as opposed to the child's?

 MR. SALMONS: Well it, that is essentially 

our position although I would add that our position is 

that all of the rights of the statute are rights that 

are shared by the parent. At least with regard to the 

substantive --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then you still 

haven't said anything. I thought you were saying that 

they can sue for the money and they can sue for denied 

procedures. But if all the procedures are given and 

they're still not satisfied with the public education

that is given, they would not be able to sue claiming 

that it was inadequate under the terms of the Act.

 You think they can sue then, too, as well.

 MR. SALMONS: Yes, Your Honor. We do --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you haven't said 

anything then.

 MR. SALMONS: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You really haven't limited 

the scope of the parent's right to sue at all.

 MR. SALMONS: Well -- well -- just because I 

haven't limited the rights of the parents right doesn't 

mean that I haven't been trying to make a point about 

how to interpret the statute. The statute we think does 

not limit the parents' rights to sue on behalf of their 

child and on behalf of their own rights under the 

statute.

 We think the way to think about this --

again, keep in mind that the right to initiate a due 

process hearing and the right to seek review of that in 

court, those are rights that are contained in Section 

1415, which is the procedural protection, the procedural 

guarantees of the Act. And we think those are rights 

that belong to the parents.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Fine. You've given the 

procedure but where does the Act guarantee the parents

the proper outcome? The proper -- assignment?

 MR. SALMONS: Well, we think the way --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It does give the parents 

the right procedures explicitly and the rights to 

reimbursement for -- for private tuition.

 MR. SALMONS: The -- that -- that's correct. 

The way we look at the question, Your Honor, is to say 

it gives the parents those rights, it gives the parents 

the right to be full members of the IEP team that 

determines the appropriate education for that child. 

While the school district has the final say as far as 

the contents of the IEP, the parents as members of that 

team have the right to initiate litigation through 

administrative procedures and then ultimately in court, 

if their view of what is appropriate for their child is 

rejected by the -- by the -- by the IEP team. And 

while, and no doubt --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that right, where --

where is that right contained? You have given us 

citations for the other ones. Where is that right 

contained?

schooling, but I do not believe the outcome, the 

education given to my child in the public school was 

enough.

 MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, what I would refer 

you to are the many provisions of the Act, and you can 

turn to pages 16 A and 17 A for example of Petitioner's 

brief that has these, in part, where the Act repeatedly 

refers to the parents' due process complaint, the 

parents' due process complaint, known as the parents' 

right to a due process hearing. The 2004 amendments 

expressly refer, define prevailing party to be parents.

 It referred to the parents' cause of action 

JUSTICE SCALIA: They have the right -- they 

have the right to the hearing. But do they have the 

right --

MR. SALMONS: They have a right --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do they have a right in and 

of themselves -- not as guardians -- do they have the 

right to a particular outcome in the hearing? That's, 

that's the point I'm inquiring to.

 MR. SALMONS: Our way of looking at the 

statute, Your Honor, says that if they are the ones that 

initiate the hearing, they file the complaint, they are 

parties to that hearing, then when, when their claims

are denied, they are parties aggrieved within the 

meaning of the statute. It's the same term, parties 

aggrieved, that refers to the right to an appeal in the 

administrative process that refers to the ability to 

initiate a civil cause of action.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It is not -- it is 

not just party aggrieved. It's party aggrieved by the 

findings and decision, as opposed to party aggrieved by 

a denial of the procedural right, and those strike me as 

two different things.

 MR. SALMONS: Well, I -- does say, it does 

reference back, in fact it references back to the 

complaint that's filed to initiate the due process 

hearing. And the parties are the ones that -- excuse 

me, the parents are the ones that are referred to as the 

ones filing those complaints. It is referred to 

repeatedly as the parents' complaint and the parents are 

-- are referred to as prevailing parties in the civil 

action. Again in the attorneys fee provisions that were 

added in 2004, expressly refer to quote, "the parents' 

complaint or subsequent cause of action." This is on 

page 24 A of Petitioner's brief.

 And it refers to parents as a prevailing 

party. There are other provisions that do so as well

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PIERRE H. BERGERON,

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. BERGERON: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court.

 The common law rule banning parental pro se 

representation is as longstanding as it is pervasive. 

Appreciating the fact that the IDEA does not abrogate 

the common law rule, Petitioners instead seek to 

circumvent that through this substantive rights theory. 

If a due process complaint never raised any issue of 

parental substantive rights, nor even did their cert 

petition, which at page 11 said children had substantive 

rights but parents have procedural rights.

 Now, however, they tell this Court that the 

right -- the parents' substantive right is so ingrained 

in the fabric of the statute that the courts should 

recognize it.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: How do you classify right 

to reimbursement?

 MR. BERGERON: Your Honor, I would classify 

that as not a right, it's a remedy. It is a remedy

premised on the denial of the FAPE to the child. And as 

a result, it is simply a derivative claim for the 

parents to recover those funds.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The right to recover 

money, it's just a remedy, it's not a right?

 MR. BERGERON: That's, and that's how 1412 

is structured, the provisions about reimbursement. It 

depends upon the predicate finding that the child was 

denied a FAPE and therefore one of the remedies, among 

other remedies, compensatory education and so forth, is 

reimbursement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the provision 

that says at no cost to the parent?

 MR. BERGERON: Your Honor, certainly that 

has been one of the emphases by Petitioners, but the 

response to that is that the free aspect of the free 

appropriate public education does not give parents a 

substantive right to the education itself. We are not 

talking -- we are debating in this case, the merits of 

this case, we are debating the A aspect, the 

appropriateness. We are not saying, we have not 

expelled the student and therefore they have a claim 

based on that. It is simply --

reimbursement is paid to whom?

 MR. BERGERON: Your Honor --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The child or the parents?

 MR. BERGERON: Our position is it would be 

paid to the child. The child would be the party that 

could bring that claim. And I just would like to 

clarify. If you look at page 153 of the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You reimburse the child 

for money that his parents spent?

 MR. BERGERON: And Your Honor, that is how 

the court, lower courts in the Third Circuit, where the 

Collinsgru rule prevails, that's how they apply it.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What would -- what would 

happen if the child were deceased or incompetent?

 MR. BERGERON: Well, that is, that is 

exactly the scenario in the Seventh Circuit case that 

they cited in 2007. And they said it's, the child's 

estate is the one that brings the claim. Now in that 

case, the child had actually expended the funds. But 

that case upheld the rule that we were advocating here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: In an instance in which the 

money is paid to the -- the reimbursement is paid to the 

child, how does the child get the money to the parents?

 MR. BERGERON: You've got to assume --

children don't. Do they set up trust funds for these 

reimbursements?

 MR. BERGERON: Your Honor, I think it is no 

different than a basic attorney fee award. There's not, 

there's not a claim that -- that, you know, if someone 

else, if the uncle pays the attorneys' fees that didn't 

negate the award of fees on behalf of the child.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I'm not talking about 

negating the award. I'm -- if that theory is sound, if 

the child is the proper recipient of the reimbursement, 

I presume that ultimately the reimbursement is supposed 

to go to the person who paid the money?

 MR. BERGERON: That's right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Which would be the parent. 

My question is how does the child in that case get the 

money to the parent?

 MR. BERGERON: Well, because the claim would 

have to be brought on behalf of the child, because they 

would not have the capacity to bring the claim itself, 

the award would go straight to the, to the guardian, who 

may be the parent that is proceeding on their behalf.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the guardian can't the 

funds that belong to the child.

 MR. BERGERON: Well, but Your Honor, we 

believe that that's the pragmatic result that Congress

intended here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. But if the, if 

the guardian is in a position to convey the money to 

himself in the different capacity as the parent, then 

why isn't the guardian equally in a, in a position to be 

substituted for the child in -- in litigating the 

action?

 MR. BERGERON: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You can't have it -- you 

can't have it both ways.

 MR. BERGERON: Well, the guardian can 

certainly bring the claim on behalf of the child. But 

its' different than bringing the claim in their own 

right. And I would point that at page 153 of the joint 

appendix, it specifies at the -- at the administrative 

hearing level, there was no claim for reimbursement to 

the parents. In fact, what they were seeking was 

reimbursement to Monarch, to the school. In other 

words, as far as the administrative record disclosed 

they had not actually paid the funds.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What is this to do -- I 

mean, I'm -- I'm puzzled about why we're talking about 

this complicated thing. I mean why -- the statute as I 

read it has a section and it's called procedural, 

procedural rights.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And it says that the 

procedural rights, right at the beginning, are for both 

the children and the parents. And it sets up some 

procedures in the agency which is for the children and 

the parents and school board, and everybody is supposed 

to be there. And then another part of the same section 

says any person aggrieved by the first has a court 

hearing.

 Why isn't that the end of it? It's clearly 

aimed, as the statute is aimed, at both students and 

parents. And then we give them all procedural rights, 

and what in the statute says that the procedures that 

they're following before the school board happen to be 

for both parents and students. But without saying a 

word, a different procedure, a Federal court procedure 

in the same section, without saying anything, would be 

just for the students and not for the parents?

 I mean, I find that hard to read the statute 

that way.

 MR. BERGERON: Well, Your Honor, if you're 

talking about the distinction between the procedural and 

the substance in the Act, Congress made clear --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not. I'm talking 

about the whole Act. Throughout the whole Act, they

talk about parents and students.

 MR. BERGERON: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And who writes the check? 

The student?

 MR. BERGERON: Generally, no, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No. Of course. The parent 

writes the check. And has the interest? I have an 

interest in educating my children as you do in yours. 

And this statute talks about that throughout.

 MR. BERGERON: Just --

JUSTICE BREYER: So I'm looking at the 

particular words in the procedural section, and the 

particular words explicitly say that every subsection is 

both for parent, through child; and then we get to the 

Court one and it talks about person aggrieved.

 And you, I guess, have to convince me --

which as I'm putting it, sounds like an uphill battle --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: But you have --

MR. BERGERON: I'll do my best.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You have to convince me 

that person aggrieved at the at the end of this section 

is meant to apply to only some of the people whom every 

other section talks about, namely just children, not 

parents.

Now why should I read that it way?

 MR. BERGERON: Well, let me try to explain, 

Justice Breyer. The reason is as Petitioners 

effectively conceded in their reply brief, party 

aggrieved does depend on the party entitled to the 

remedy. And if we look at the amendment in 

1415(f)(3)(E), which was just added in 2004, it 

clarifies that all relief that the hearing officer 

should award is based on substantive violation to the 

child.

 And it's important that if we look to the 

entirety of subchapter 2, there are more than two dozen 

references to the right, to the obligation, to the 

provision of a FAPE to the child. That is what we are 

talking about. The dispute resolution provisions hinge 

on vindicating the child's right. And I think the 

question earlier to Mr. Salmons was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What's that section you 

just alluded to? I'm blasting by it. Where is it, in 

the --

MR. BERGERON: I'm sorry, which section?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: F --

MR. BERGERON: Oh, 1415(f)(3)(E}, I'm

 MR. BERGERON: It's 1415(f)(3)(E).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you said 14.

 MR. BERGERON: (f)(3)(E).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you sure it's not 

18(a)?

 MR. BERGERON: (f)(3)(E) is on 21a of my 

version of the blue brief, Your Honor. That's the 

provision that's titled decision of the hearing officer, 

and provides that the hearing officer should grant 

relief on substantive grounds.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's in 18(a) of mine, too. 

Maybe I have a different brief there.

 MR. BERGERON: That's not my brief, Your 

Honor, I apologize. In any event, it limits the hearing 

officer's ability to reward relief based on the 

substantive, whether the substantive right to the FAPE 

has been awarded or not. And then we return to 

Justice Breyer's point about the party aggrieved, the 

party aggrieved by the finding or decision. Because the 

decision is limited to substantive grounds, that is what

we are really talking about here. And I think one of 

the confusing aspects about what the nature of the 

substantive right is, and I think we've heard some 

different versions of that this morning, is what is the 

scope.

 Petitioners in their reply brief seem to try 

to retreat a little bit and make the rights more 

palatable. But if they -- in doing so, the question is, 

what is the right different than the child's right? And 

we simply do not have the answer to that, and for the 

school districts applying this act on a daily basis, and 

for courts interpreting it, it simply poses numerous 

problems trying to apply to a parent a statute that was 

designed to benefit children.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Your argument, I guess, is 

this argument. Now you're conceding the parent does 

have a right to go to court, but he can only complain 

about something that hurts him. Right?

 MR. BERGERON: I would not --

JUSTICE BREYER: He can't complain in court 

or -- well, it sounds as if you were saying that. 

You're saying that the hearing officer has to decide 

against the parent and if he doesn't decide against the 

parent, obviously the parent can't go into court because 

he doesn't have anything to complain about, the parent.

Isn't that your point?

 MR. BERGERON: Well, he can't decide against 

the parent because the only issue at stake is the right 

of the child.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well -- right. I'm 

sorry. Then you go ahead. I thought I heard you say 

that the problem is that the parent didn't have a right 

taken away by the hearing officer, and that's why the 

parent can't go to court.

 MR. BERGERON: Well, he won't have a right 

taken away from him because it's not -- it's not his 

claim at stake in the due process hearing.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, I would agree, we can 

be on the same grounds there.

 MR. BERGERON: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I agree that if the parent 

isn't hurt, if the parent wasn't deprived of anything, 

the parents can go to court but doesn't have anything to 

complain about, you know, whereas another section of the 

statute says that reimbursement is something supposed to 

be reimbursement for the parent, so it would seem as if 

the panther has something to complain about. Isn't that 

so? It says the -- I think so -- it says a parent is to 

be reimbursed. I thought that was one of the things 

that --

MR. BERGERON: That's correct, Your Honor. 

That's what it says.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So, now it looks as if the 

parent has something to complain about. The parent 

hasn't got the money that he was supposed to get. Now 

we have something to complain about, so therefore, we're 

aggrieved, and then the last section says an aggrieved 

person can go to court.

 MR. BERGERON: Right. We simply feel that 

because the reimbursement, as I said before, hinges on 

the deprivation of the right to the child and not the 

deprivation of the substantive right to the parent, it 

is the child's claim to bring. I appreciate --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Bergeron, I have a 

basic conceptual problem, both with that response and 

with your larger argument. Leaving aside how we should 

classify the reimbursement right or classify 

reimbursement, you make a broad distinction between the 

substantive right of the child to the free appropriate 

public education and on the other hand, the procedural 

rights of the parent in going through the process that 

ultimately comes to a conclusion for the child's 

benefit.

 The conceptual problem I have is that I 

don't understand why it makes sense to say that the

parents have procedural rights unless that procedural --

or unless those procedural rights of the parents are in 

aid of some substantive entitlement for the parents. We 

give procedural protection to people in order to 

vindicate some substantive interest that they can claim, 

and you're, in effect, splitting those two apart. 

You're saying one person has a substantive right, the 

other people have procedural right. And I don't see 

conceptually how you can make that split. And if you 

don't make that split, then it only makes sense that the 

right to the free public -- the free appropriate public 

education is, as the statute in one place seems to say, 

a right of the family group, the parents and the child 

together, rather than the right of the child alone.

 So conceptually, how do you defend the 

distinction that you make between substantive rights on 

one person and procedural rights in another?

 MR. BERGERON: And here's how I would 

explain it, Justice Souter.

 The right, the substantive right is the 

right to a FAPE to the child. And because the child 

does not have capacity, Congress implemented a pragmatic 

system to allow the parents to protect those rights. 

It's derivative for the parent to protect the child's 

right --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why don't we say that 

they are the procedural rights of the child and the 

parents are simply stepping into the child's shoes to 

vindicate them?

 MR. BERGERON: That is exactly what 1415(m) 

says, Your Honor. That allows a transfer of rights. 

And 1415(m) is at 11a and 12a of the red brief, and I 

hope I've got the cite right this time. 1415(m) allows 

for states to require, and Ohio does, to require the 

transfer of all rights under subchapter 2 that a parent 

would otherwise have, straight to the child. So 

basically --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's when the child 

reaches majority.

 MR. BERGERON: That's right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The child is no longer a 

child, the child is an adult.

 MR. BERGERON: And that's my -- that's part 

of what I was trying to say.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm sorry. You go ahead.

 MR. BERGERON: Oh. Well, what I'm trying to 

say is because the child lacks capacity, they can't do 

all these things on their own until they reach majority. 

But once they do and the rights transfer, it illustrates 

that it's not really the parents' rights, it is the

child's right that they are protecting.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what stands in 

the way of that analysis is the text, which says all 

other rights accorded to parents under this subchapter 

transfer to the child.

 Not only doesn't that help you, it seems to 

me it hurts you. It acknowledges that there are rights 

accorded to parents.

 MR. BERGERON: Right. And those would be 

the procedural safeguards that are delineated in the 

Act.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But then you were denying 

them, as I understood the argument.

 MR. BERGERON: Well, let me clarify then. I 

wasn't denying the existence of the procedural 

safeguard. To the contrary, what I'm saying is that 

they are not redressible independent of themselves in 

Federal court unless -- and this is what 1415(f)(3)(E) 

clarifies, is that you have to have a substantive 

violation. Because if you think of a situation in which 

the child is provided a FAPE, no one disputes that, but 

a parent says well, you didn't invite me to a meeting, 

what's your remedy there? There is no remedy. And 

that's what Congress was trying to clarify.

the analysis that you're coming up with, parents end up 

without even the procedural rights, because you're 

saying the only person who can basically invoke a 

violation of procedural right is the person whose been 

denied the substantive right. The parent hasn't been 

denied the substantive right. Therefore, the parent 

cannot invoke even the procedural right which ostensibly 

on your own analysis, the parent has been given. That 

can't be correct.

 MR. BERGERON: Your Honor, if you look at --

I'll direct you to the DiBuo case and the Lesesne case, 

I'm probably mispronouncing both of them --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but before you direct 

me to cases --

MR. BERGERON: Okay.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What's wrong with the 

analytical point that I just made?

 MR. BERGERON: Well, Your Honor, the --

that's what Congress was trying to clarify in 2004. 

They did not want technical procedural violations to 

eclipse the substantive rights, and so what they 

provided was the substantive right is the only one that 

is important.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but instead of saying 

they're not eclipsed, you're saying they are totally

blocked out. Because you analysis, I thought was, in 

response to my earlier objection, that the procedural 

right, in fact, can only ultimately be invoked for the 

vindication of the substantive right. And because the 

substantive right is the child's, not the parents, it 

would follow that the parents cannot even invoke their 

procedural rights, and we know that that can't be 

correct.

 MR. BERGERON: Right, and I'm not saying 

that the parent -- the parent's procedural rights are 

gone. I mean, remember --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But if the parent's 

procedural rights are not gone, then the parents must be 

able to invoke those procedural rights based on what 

they claim to be a denial of some substantive 

entitlement. You're saying that's the entitlement of 

the child, but if the parents are going to have any 

procedural right worth having, they've got to invoke it 

for the purpose of vindicating that substantive right; 

isn't that correct?

 MR. BERGERON: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Then why do not the 

parents, when they are claiming that they are aggrieved, 

have as much right to make a claim that goes to the 

substantive denial as to the procedural denial, simply

because the two are inseparable?

 MR. BERGERON: Your Honor, because that --

again, that was what Congress was trying to clarify in 

2004. And if you look at the DiBuo case and the Lesesne 

case cited on page 27 of the SG's brief, both those 

cases make clear that notwithstanding procedural 

violations, there must actually be a causation, there 

must actually be substantive harm before any relief can 

flow from that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does a parent have a 

right to bring a 1983 action if their procedural rights 

under this statute are interfered with by the state 

actors?

 MR. BERGERON: Your Honor, if the parent 

would otherwise have a 1983 claim under 1415(l), if it 

relates to an IDEA claim, there would have to be 

exhaustion first.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think I understand 

your argument based on 3(E), but when I look at 21a of 

my blue brief there's another provision on attorneys' 

fees and it's phrased in a very curious way. It says 

that fees are allowed to a prevailing party who is the 

parent of a child with a disability. It seems to me 

that's the most difficult express language for you to 

deal with. It doesn't say attorneys' fees happen to be

allowed to parents, it's to a prevailing party who is a 

parent. And I understand your argument to be that a 

parent can never be a prevailing party.

 MR. BERGERON: That's right. And let me try 

to explain why. If you look at 1411(e)(3)(E), which is 

5a of the red brief, and I'm sorry to keep jumping 

briefs on you, that provides that litigation brought to 

secure the right of the child to a FAPE is brought on 

behalf of the child. So Congress added both that 

section and the section you were just referring to at 

the same time, and the only way to read them 

harmoniously is that any action that is being brought on 

behalf of the child to secure the FAPE, it's not the 

parent's own action that they are bringing, they are 

bringing it on their own -- on behalf of the child.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What was the section you 

cited?

 MR. BERGERON: 1411(e)(3)(E), on 5a of the 

red brief.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: (e)(3)(E).

 MR. BERGERON: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Legal fees. The 

disbursements under subparagraph (d) shall not support 

legal fees, court costs, or other costs associated with 

the cause of action brought on behalf of a child with a

disability to ensure a free and appropriate public 

education for such child.

 What do you think that proves?

 MR. BERGERON: What I'm saying is Congress 

recognized that when legal action is being brought to 

secure FAPE, just like it's the child's right to the 

FAPE under subchapter 2, it is being brought on behalf 

of the child. And that's where petitioners run into 

problem with the common rule law, because the common law 

rule that they don't dispute is that parents cannot 

bring claims on behalf of the child pro se. So they 

have to find a way to abrogate, and they initially 

argued in the opening brief for an exception to the 

common law rule, which from my reading of the reply 

brief they have abandoned. So the core issue in dispute 

as far as the petitioners go is what is the nature of 

the substantive right.

 And I'd like to make the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's a section you 

pointed to that says disbursements under subparagraph 

(d), but your brief doesn't include subparagraph (d).

 MR. BERGERON: It's the high cost, one of 

the high cost funds for states, Justice Ginsburg.

 I'd like to make --

provision is limited to subparagraph (d), how can you 

argue that it covers the waterfront?

 MR. BERGERON: Well, Your Honor, I think 

it's indicative of what Congress appreciated the claim 

would look like on any level, and it's not simply saying 

that those funds aren't provided under subparagraph (d). 

That is the nature of the claim. Regardless of under 

what section we are looking at, that is the nature of 

the claim that could be brought in order to secure a 

FAPE for the child, and in every circumstance, it is 

brought on behalf of the child.

 Your Honor, I'd like to make one point, if I 

can, about the spending clause, in response to 

petitioner's argument in the reply brief.

 Petitioners effectively say that the 

spending clause doesn't apply because this is not an 

issue of liability. I'd like to direct your attention 

again to Rowley, where at footnotes 11 and 26 the Court 

recognized the difference between the educational 

benefit which is the FAPE, and maximizing the 

educational outcome.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are attorneys' fees 

allowed to a parent who is bringing one of these cases 

on behalf of a child pro se?

 MR. BERGERON: No.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's a convoluted 

question. Okay. So there's no issue under the spending 

clause that a non-attorney parent would be able to claim 

some sort of attorneys' fees?

 MR. BERGERON: That's what -- I think there 

have been four circuits who addressed that in the 

context of attorney parents, and they've all said that 

they cannot get fees.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how is the 

spending clause issue very significant in terms of the 

exposure of the school boards?

 MR. BERGERON: Well, Arlington did not limit 

it to simply liability. It said repeatedly obligations 

and conditions. And that's exactly what Rowley was 

looking at in footnotes 11 and 26. We don't necessarily 

have -- have to have a line item that there's going to 

be X dollars in damage. It was simply the difference 

between an educational benefit and maximizing that 

benefit that triggered spending cost concerns in Rowley. 

Just like in South Dakota v Dole the issue of whether 

someone was 21 in order to consume alcohol was not 

necessarily a liability but it was a very important 

obligation or condition imposed upon the State.

 And their second point regarding the 

spending clause is that not every single detail needs to

be fleshed out in clear notice.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So I take it your argument 

is, your red brief argument is that Congress said, 

states, if you get some judgments against you and they 

award attorneys' fees, you pay for it, we won't? Is 

that what it said?

 MR. BERGERON: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You don't pay for it, you 

can't pay for it out of the grant?

 MR. BERGERON: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So we're not paying 

for this, you pay for it. Is that right?

 MR. BERGERON: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE BREYER: States --

MR. BERGERON: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- if some people bring 

claims against you under this because you didn't have a 

good plan for the child and your attorneys' fees are 

awarded against you, don't pay for it out of this grant. 

Isn't that what you're saying it says?

 MR. BERGERON: Well, Your Honor, it's a 

little bit different because part of the -- part of the 

real issue here is not necessarily an award of 

attorneys' fees to the other party, but it's the 

incurrence of attorneys' fees defending --

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought what your 

argument was -- and if it's not, forget it, it's just 

that I don't understand it. That here the Government 

says pay for this out of your own pocket, and then its 

defines what you're supposed to pay out of our own 

pocket is, as a parent representing a child, not his own 

action.

 And then later on they say, they define it 

differently. They talk about prevailing party. The 

parents of the prevailing party. But you say that 

second phrase must mean the first phrase. Because it 

wouldn't make sense for the Government to say pay for 

that out of the grant but not this out of the grant. 

That's your argument?

 MR. BERGERON: And -- I think that's right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. It is an argument.

 MR. BERGERON: And -- and just to clarify, 

Congress hasn't provided any funds for this. I mean 

they, they recognized in 2004 they were only funding 19 

percent of the obligations of the statute, and we have 

to pick up the balance of the tab.

 And their other argument on the spending 

clause is that it's, you don't have to flesh out 

everything in the statute but here we're talking about 

two core issues. One is abrogating the common rule law

and the other is creation of substantive rights to an 

entirely new class of beneficiaries.

 If there's ever anything that demanded clear 

notice, this is it. It is much more serious and severe 

than the expert fees at issue in Arlington, and school 

districts and states simply have to have notice, what is 

the parameter of the right that you are being requested 

to recognize? And based on the briefing, and based on 

what we have heard in argument, it is simply not clear 

to the school districts not only what the nature of the 

right is but how to apply it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's where I 

have a little bit of trouble. It's not -- the 

underlying right is still the same. It's the right of 

the child to a free and appropriate public education. 

And that can be vindicated in court actions by attorneys 

who get their fees paid if they prevail, and all we're 

talking about is a situation where the parents can 

assert that same right when an attorney won't.

 And I'm just wondering how significant 

additional exposure we're talking about? And what turns 

on that is whether to take the spending clause argument 

seriously or not.

 MR. BERGERON: Well -- and I think the 

answer to that is it's still not clear to me from --

from listening to the argument today, I mean, Petitioner 

acknowledged the child falls out of the equation.

 This is a statute that needs to benefit the 

child, and they're taking the child completely out. And 

so what is the nature of this parental right? The SG 

says well, it's all, it's all intertwined. But if we 

look at what Petitioner said --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if you agree we're 

talking about. What is the toll on the states, it seems 

to me that if the state would have to pay for a lawyer, 

if it lost, and that parents who brings the case is not 

entitled to reimbursement, how is the state's pocketbook 

affected?

 MR. BERGERON: Justice Ginsburg, in 

litigating this case while the Winkelmans were pro se, 

we expended far greater than the $8,000 at issue in 

Arlington, on our legal fees defending --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. But you 

would have had to do that if they had gotten a lawyer to 

take the case. What, what your spending clause argument 

is, the State agreed to undertake this liability, that 

they would have to provide a free and appropriate 

education, that if they litigated, they would have pay 

the other side's attorneys' fees. But if they knew that 

in the case where an attorney wouldn't take it, the

overturning their decision and that might result in 

greater expense, well, in that case they would not have 

bought into this deal at all. That seems a little 

implausible.

 MR. BERGERON: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, 

remember at the time the Congress reauthorized in 2004, 

every circuit that had addressed it besides the First 

had agreed that parents could not bring a pro se. So 

the states reasonably would not have believed, 

especially in the circuits where it was decided, that 

they would have to -- have to come up with these funds.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not disputing 

that it results in additional exposure. I'm just 

disputing that it affects the voluntariness of their 

agreement to undertake the program.

 MR. BERGERON: Well, if you, in the dissent 

in Arlington, they made -- Justice Breyer made a 

basically materiality argument and the majority did not 

seem moved by it. So I think, this is something that is 

very significant, not simply on the dollars involved, 

but how we apply this substantive right to parents that 

Petitioners seek to have recognized.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the court appoint 

the parent guardian ad litem and just the parent proceed

as guardian ad litem?

 MR. BERGERON: That wouldn't solve the issue 

of, under the common law the guardian ad litem would not 

have the ability to receive pro se on the common law 

fees, the same as the parent. The rule is the same. So 

they would still have --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The guardian ad litem 

cannot proceed pro se?

 MR. BERGERON: That's right. Unless they're 

-- unless they have -- unless they are an attorney. 

Which in many cases the appointment to someone who is an 

attorney.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Bergeron, on, one of 

the points you made on the spending clause argument, I 

thought, was that if there are lawyers representing the 

parents, the lawyers are going to screen out the more 

frivolous cases. If they are not, more frivolous cases 

are going to be brought. And there's -- there's an 

intuitive appeal to that argument.

 Do we have any -- any figures on the 

comparative numbers of frivolous cases in lawyer 

representation and pro se representation under the Act?

 MR. BERGERON: Justice Souter, we don't 

because most of the circuits were saying this is --

we're not going to allow pro se --

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE,

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. ANDRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 I would like to turn briefly to Respondents' 

assertion that Petitioners somehow waived their claim to 

reimbursement by not exhausting it below. We addressed 

this in our reply brief, but if the Court wishes to look 

at pages 78 and 88 of the joint appendix, particularly 

page 78, there it is clear that the Petitioners were 

seeking reimbursement in their own right.

 On the page 153, that Respondent refers to, 

I assume that that point in time we were now on appeal 

to the second tier of the Ohio administrative 

proceeding, and perhaps at that point in time, Monarch 

School was actually paying for Jake's education on a

grant-like basis, because that was something that 

happened in this case. And that perhaps at that point 

in time Petitioners referenced reimbursement to Monarch 

because Monarch had actually been expending the fund. 

But by and large my clients expended the funds to 

educate Jake at Monarch School, and they certainly did 

exhaust that claim to reimbursement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you claiming that 

hiring an attorney would be a cost, if the phrase "at no 

cost to the parent," if they have to hire an attorney, 

that the cost --

MR. ANDRE: Certainly. And I mean, I think 

that's why Congress included the attorneys' fee 

provision in 2004 that recognized that parents can be 

prevailing parties. And if they prevail on establishing 

that a free appropriate public education has not been 

provided, then they can recover attorneys' fees as part 

of their, their right to try to vindicate Congress's 

purposes at no cost to them.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why didn't 

Congress just add the provision making this very clear 

that the Senate had passed, why did the House boot it 

out of the conference bill?

 MR. ANDRE: We don't know. The legislative 

record is entirely silent. But one plausible inference

could be, could be reached based on looking at the 

addition of attorney's fees provision and the timing of 

the Maroni decision in the First Circuit. Maroni came 

down after the parental lay representation provision was 

proposed by the Senate.

 Maroni was the first court of appeals case 

to recognize that parents may litigate these cases pro 

se. The way Maroni did it however was by adopting our 

primary argument here today, which is that parents 

possess the right to -- to sue in their own name, as pro 

se litigants, not as lay representatives of their 

children, and seek to enforce the full bundle of rights.

 Congress very well could have looked at 

Maroni and said aha, that's what we intended all along; 

Maroni got it right, and then they just put -- Congress 

just put the thumb on the scale a little bit by enacting 

the attorneys fee provision which made it clear that 

parents can be, or are the prevailing party if the 

plaintiffs prevail in an IDEA action.

 Finally, I would like to address two -- two 

points about the spending clause. Of course we believe 

the spending clause is totally inapplicable, but I want 

to respond to Respondent's suggest that we're advocating 

creation of a new substantive right here.

it's totally inapplicable?

 MR. ANDRE: We think that this Court's 

spending clause jurisprudence is concerned with 

providing clear notice to states with respect to 

liability and certain fiscal obligations. And what 

Respondent is complaining about here --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Please --

MR. ANDRE: Oh, what Respondent is 

complaining about here is essentially a disparate 

impact. And this Court has never recognize a disparate 

impact claim under the spending clause.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think it is 

not violated, not that it doesn't apply for some reason? 

There is no doubt this is spending clause legislation, 

right?

 MR. ANDRE: Well, absolutely spending clause 

legislation. But we believe that the clear notice 

concerns of the spending clause are not even implicated. 

But that if the clear notice concerns were implicated, 

the statute is -- clear.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

The case is submitted.

matter was submitted at 11:04 a.m.]
