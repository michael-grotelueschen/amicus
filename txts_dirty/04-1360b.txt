(10:00 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear reargument 

this morning in Hudson v. Michigan. 

Mr. Moran. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

For centuries the knock and announce rule has 

been a core part of the right of the people to be 

secure in their houses from unreasonable searches and 

seizures. It reflects the notion that when the 

government has the right to enter a house, whether to 

perform an arrest, to search for evidence, or to seize 

goods, that the people should have the right to answer 

the door in a dignified manner, except in an emergency, 

and to avoid the unnecessarily gratuitous embarrassment 

and shock that often follows a precipitous police 

entry. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So wouldn't it be 

more accurate to say that it's protected the right to 

be free from unreasonable entry as opposed to 

unreasonable search and seizure? 

MR. MORAN: Well, this Court has recognized

in Wilson, consistent with the common law authorities, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that they are connected, that the 

entry directly affects the reasonableness of the search 

and seizure that occurs within. And that's why this 

Court in Miller and in Sabbath suppressed the evidence 

following knock and announce violations. But in 

Wilson, this Court directly stated that the common law, 

the Fourth Amendment, -- the common law that informs 

the Fourth Amendment, directly demonstrates that the 

Framers thought that the method of entry directly 

affects whether a search or seizure inside a home is 

reasonable. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so in your view, 

there has to be a 4- to 6-hour search for complex 

financial records, business documents. There's a 

warrant. The search is otherwise proper. They forget 

to knock. They say, oh, you know, we are police 

officers. There's a discussion for a while. But --

anything seized after that is -- must be suppressed. 

MR. MORAN: If there is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It just seems to me in the 

hypothetical I put -- and there's obviously a reason I 

put it -- is there's just no causal link between the --

the suppression and -- and the failure to knock. 

MR. MORAN: Your Honor, the evidence inside

-- the evidence is seized inside. The seizure of the 

evidence inside is directly related to the manner of 

entry, just as there's a direct causal link between 

when the officers come in without a warrant when they 

should have gotten a warrant first. They thought there 

was an exigent --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but you say directly 

related. That -- that assumes the very point that I 

have in mind. I don't know why it's directly related. 

MR. MORAN: Well, going back to Wilson, this 

Court said in Wilson, if I might quote from Wilson, 

that the -- the common law search and seizure leaves no 

doubt that the reasonableness of a search of a dwelling 

may depend in part on whether law enforcement officers 

announce their presence and authority prior to 

entering. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It depends -- it depends in 

part. 

MR. MORAN: It depends in part, certainly. 

There are other factors as well, but the reasonableness 

of the search depends in part. 

The issue --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, what -- what do you 

do with our opinion in -- in 1986 in Segura v. United 

States, which seems to me to contradict your assertion

that you cannot separate, for purposes of the 

exclusionary rule, the manner of entry from the search? 

In that case, the -- the policemen entered without a 

search warrant. So the entry was clearly a violation. 

They left two officers in the room and other officers 

went back and got a search warrant. When they returned 

with the search warrant, the two officers who were in 

the room proceeded to do a search, and we admitted the 

evidence. It seems to me that in that case, we -- we 

did succeed in -- in separating the -- the entry from 

the subsequent search, and I don't know why -- why we 

can't do the same thing here. 

MR. MORAN: Because there were exceptional 

circumstances, Justice Scalia, in Segura. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what were the 

exceptional circumstances? 

MR. MORAN: A 19-hour delay and a warrant 

that was obtained that had nothing to do with the 

initial entry. That was in no way dependent on the 

initial entry. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: We're still, it would seem 

to me -- I don't know -- the warrant wasn't dependent 

on the initial entry? You could also say the initial 

entry wasn't the product of the -- of the later 

warrant.

 MR. MORAN: The initial entry was not the

JUSTICE SCALIA: And therefore was unlawful. 

MR. MORAN: That's right. The -- the initial 

entry wasn't lawful. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But we didn't hold -- but we 

didn't hold that. 

MR. MORAN: Well, but this -- the Government 

in Segura never contested the fact that the evidence 

that was seen and seized during the initial entry 

should be suppressed. And that's all we're asking for 

here. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me? No, I don't 

understand that. 

MR. MORAN: When the officers went in 

initially in Segura, some evidence was seen and seized 

at that time, and the Government did not contest that 

that evidence should not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. I'm talking about only 

the evidence that -- that was the product of the search 

conducted after the warrant was delivered. 

MR. MORAN: That's right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that evidence was 

admitted in.

 MR. MORAN: Right, but the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though the entry of 

those officers was an unlawful entry. 

MR. MORAN: The entry -- the initial entry 

was an unlawful entry. When they came back with the 

warrant --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, no, no. The -- there 

was no subsequent entry. You said the initial entry 

was unlawful. Those officers stayed there. Their 

presence there was the product of an unlawful entry. 

MR. MORAN: Their presence was, yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Their presence was the 

product of an unlawful entry, and nonetheless, we 

admitted in the -- the material that they obtained in 

the search after a warrant had been obtained. 

MR. MORAN: I -- I read Segura as saying that 

the presence -- the later presence of the warrant, 

which was in no way tainted by the initial entry, made 

the officers' presence in the home retroactively lawful 

from that point. It was unlawful until that point, 

which is why the Government did not contest the -- the 

point that all the evidence that was seized during the 

initial entry up to the point when the warrant was 

issued had to be suppressed. That's all we're asking 

for here.

 I can imagine hypotheticals in which you have 

a knock and announce violation and then something 

happens like in Segura or like in Murray, where you 

have later action that creates an independent source. 

But in your typical --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the -- suppose the 

officer -- excuse me, we forgot to knock, but we are 

police officers. We do have a warrant. We're going to 

proceed with a search. Please don't be alarmed. We're 

going to -- does that do it? 

MR. MORAN: That might do it. That would be 

a different case than the case we have here --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but your -- your 

point is -- is there -- is that they have to go out and 

come back in again. 

MR. MORAN: You would have to create some 

sort of analogy to Murray and Segura. Murray and 

Segura are exceptional cases. There are very rare 

cases when the Government breaks in and then realizes 

we shouldn't have done that. We should go get a 

warrant. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree. Segura -- I 

forget what it is in torts. It's kind of a 

supervening, independent cause or something like that. 

MR. MORAN: Yes. Yes. And -- and you can

have -- imagine such hypotheticals in the knock and 

announce context. And in the Moreno case in the Ninth 

Circuit, you have one where you have a knock and 

announce violation committed in the outer door. No 

evidence is found in the outer door, but then the 

officers properly knock and announce at the inner door, 

and the Court in the Ninth Circuit held that that was 

proper to seize that. We have no problem with that. 

That -- that seems like a proper result because 

ultimately the purposes of the knock and announce rule 

were vindicated when the officers knocked and announced 

at the inner door before -- before forcing entry. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Moran, how -- how 

long do you think the officers had to wait before they 

could have entered? 

MR. MORAN: In this case? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 

MR. MORAN: From Banks, somewhere closer to 

15 seconds. 15 to 20 seconds was considered --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What would -- if they 

had done that, what would have been different from what 

happened in this case? 

MR. MORAN: Mr. Hudson presumably would have 

gotten up from his chair, would have come to the door, 

would have admitted the officers, and then after --

that? Someone sitting in a chair with gun -- with a 

gun and the drugs you say would have gotten up and 

said, oh, it's the police. Let's see what they want? 

MR. MORAN: We presume that people act 

lawfully in response to commands from the police. We 

do not presume that people will act unlawfully. If the 

police have evidence or information that someone will, 

in fact, act unlawfully by trying to dispose the 

evidence or by --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't a good sign of 

what might have happened what actually happened when 

the police came in, which was there was an effort to 

hide the evidence? 

MR. MORAN: The record does not disclose any 

effort on Mr. Hudson's part to hide any evidence, Your 

Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought -- where --

where were the drugs found? 

MR. MORAN: The rocks of crack cocaine, for 

which he was convicted, were found in his left front 

pants pocket. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where was the gun 

found? 

MR. MORAN: The gun was in the chair.

this case. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any reason 

to suppose that if the officers had waited 15 seconds 

instead of the 3 to 4, that they wouldn't have found 

the same evidence? 

MR. MORAN: It's always possible, Your Honor, 

but we don't presume that. Just as in Segura, the 

Court said --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the only -- the 

only reason they wouldn't have found the same evidence, 

I take it, is if they -- if -- if the defendants had 

had additional time to dispose of it. 

MR. MORAN: We don't contest that they would 

have found the same evidence, no. We do not argue that 

Mr. Hudson or any of the other people in the house 

would have destroyed the evidence.

MR. MORAN: It's in -- in the chair. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's pretty clear 

you don't talk of something as being in the chair. 

It's on the chair unless you stuff it in the chair. I 

assume he stuffed it behind a pillow or something. 

MR. MORAN: I'm not completely clear exactly 

where in the chair it was. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: English is English. You 

said it was in the chair. 

MR. MORAN: In the chair. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

MR. MORAN: 49 of the 50 States currently 

suppress evidence following knock and announce 

violations, just as this Court did in -- in Miller and 

Sabbath. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what do you think is 

the standard for determining what sort of causal 

connection there has to be in order to have suppression 

here?

 MR. MORAN: We go back to the Wong Sun fruits 

test. Is the evidence that was recovered the direct 

fruit of the violation? In other words, is there a 

clear, logical connection? Now, my opponent --

JUSTICE ALITO: What's the purpose of the 

causal connection requirement? What's the reason for 

having it? 

MR. MORAN: Well, it's so -- it's so that 

there is a -- an obvious connection. Before the court 

takes the step of -- of excluding evidence, there 

should be some connection, some clear connection, 

between the violation and the evidence recovered. But 

my --

JUSTICE ALITO: And what's the reason for 

requiring a clear connection? 

MR. MORAN: I suppose that it's simply the 

matter of logic, that evidence that's completely 

unrelated to a violation nobody would think should be 

-- should be excluded. But evidence --

JUSTICE ALITO: But why? 

MR. MORAN: Well, it's -- it's unrelated. So 

if, for example, the police break into my house and --

and find evidence -- find nothing in my house -- they 

illegally break into my house, but then they -- they do 

a proper warrant search of my office and find evidence,

JUSTICE ALITO: But why? Isn't the reason 

just a -- just a question of crafting an appropriate 

remedy for -- an appropriate deterrence --

MR. MORAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- for violations? 

MR. MORAN: Exactly. It -- the whole point 

is deterrence. And so you wouldn't deter the officers 

who illegally broke into my house by excluding the 

evidence from my office if -- if -- it may even well be 

different --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure you would. Sure you 

would. 

MR. MORAN: Well, it may well even be a 

different --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you'd deterred him 

more if you threw the whole case out, but we don't do 

that. 

MR. MORAN: No, we don't. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

the deterrence somehow be related --

MR. MORAN: We do. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to the -- and -- and the 

related usually means that the acquisition of the 

evidence was the product of the violation. It was 

caused by the violation. And -- and for that reason, 

we keep it out. 

And here, it's -- it's hard to say that this 

was caused by the fact that they -- that they entered 

in a few seconds too soon. So he would have answered 

the door and they would have seen the stuff. 

MR. MORAN: What the knock and announce 

violation causes, Justice Scalia, is the officer to be 

illegally in the home. Going back to the common law 

authorities, the courts have long recognized --

American courts have long recognized that an officer 

who illegally enters a home, even with a valid writ or 

a valid piece of paper allowing him to be in the home, 

if the manner of entry is illegal, he is a trespasser. 

His entry is -- is void ab initio. And so in that 

sense, the entry is the cause of the illegal --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Although you say it can be 

retroactively validated. 

MR. MORAN: After Segura --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, in Segura, you can

Could it be -- have been retroactively

the door and they knock and announce and wait -- wait 

10 seconds. 

MR. MORAN: Again, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would that do the job? 

MR. MORAN: I concede that it's possible that 

you can come up with a Segura-type hypothetical. I 

think the easiest one is the Moreno case from the Ninth 

Circuit. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The hypothetical sounds 

ridiculous only if one accepts your explanation of 

Segura, that -- that it was somehow a retroactive 

validation.

cases are Silverthorne cases.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All that it is is it's an 

independent chain of events. 

MR. MORAN: It's an independent source. 

JUSTICE BREYER: An independent chain of 

events that almost certainly would have led to the 

discovery of the evidence despite -- not without --

despite the unlawful entry. And if that's so, all we 

have is a -- is a set of cases where deterrence is most 

unlikely to play any significant role because no 

policeman could possibly count on that kind of thing 

getting the evidence in --

MR. MORAN: And that's exactly right. And --

and the situation we have in Michigan now is that 

officers know to a certainty that if they violate the 

knock and announce rule, nothing will happen. And so 

that's why in all the other States --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not true. 

There are cases where the violation of the knock and 

announce rule gives rise to evidence that may be 

admitted and that would presumably be excluded if you 

can show that the seizure is related to the violation. 

The problem here is that the evidence that is being 

suppressed, as -- as you've suggested, that there's no 

question that it would have been available if the 

officers had waited 15 seconds as opposed to 4 seconds.

 MR. MORAN: Mr. Chief Justice, none of the 

parties has been able to identify any cases in which 

you can point to evidence and say this -- this evidence 

was produced by the knock and announce violation and 

nothing else in the house --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Solicitor General 

hypothesized one in the amicus briefs. If somebody --

you know, they -- they burst in and someone screams, 

you know, run away, it's the police, that excited 

utterance caused by the absence of a knock and announce 

would presumably be related to the violation and could 

be suppressed. That doesn't mean that the gun and the 

drugs that are found in the room is in the same 

category. 

MR. MORAN: If I may make two responses to 

that. First, the Solicitor General hypothesized such a 

case but has not identified a single case where that's 

ever happened. It's purely hypothetical. 

But the second point is that excluding that 

evidence would have no deterrent effect whatsoever 

because by -- by definition, that's evidence that the 

police would only get by committing the knock and 

announce violation. So the police lose nothing by 

risking the possibility that somebody will make an 

excited utterance and then say, okay, we won't get to

use that excited utterance, but we would never have 

gotten that excited utterance in the first place. 

That's not deterrence, Mr. Chief Justice. That's 

restitution. That's like saying that I can be deterred 

from stealing something by being told that if I'm 

caught, I'll have to give it back. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What it is is 

recognizing that if there is a fruit of the illegal 

act, it is suppressed so that there is a cost to the 

illegal act. What it's saying is that not everything 

that happens after the illegal act is a fruit of the 

illegal act. 

MR. MORAN: I think your question, Mr. Chief 

Justice, really goes to the worst position language in 

Nix, and the point is, from our brief, is that this 

Court has placed the prosecution in the worst position 

than it would have been had the police acted lawfully 

dozens, possibly scores, of time -- times. 

All the cases in which the Court has noted 

that the police easily could have obtained a warrant. 

Most recently in Georgia v. Randolph, where this Court 

noted that there were two lawful methods for the police 

to get the cocaine -- the cocaine residue on the straw, 

but still suppressed the evidence. The police and the 

prosecution do get placed in a worse position, and

that's necessary for deterrence. What --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would it have been 

possible for these police to get a no-knock warrant? 

MR. MORAN: It might well have been. I was 

asked this question last time, Justice Ginsburg, and 

I'd like to modify my answer. In Michigan, there is no 

statute governing no-knock warrants, and there's --

there are also no court decisions governing no-knock 

warrants. And there never will be under the People v. 

Stevens regime. 

One of the nice things that's happened in --

in -- since Wilson v. Arkansas, in fact, before Wilson 

v. Arkansas in many States, is courts have developed --

developed procedures for police officers to get no-

knock warrants, to go to the police and ask for a no-

knock warrant. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about in this 

case, which is Justice Ginsburg's question? If the 

police said, we have reasonable grounds to -- to 

believe that he has a weapon and we're also looking for 

drugs that are easily disposable, would that be grounds 

for knocking -- for not -- for dispensing with the 

knock requirement? 

MR. MORAN: Could the -- could a judge have 

issued such a warrant in Michigan? Is that your

question? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let's take it step by 

step. Suppose the police articulate this at the outset 

MR. MORAN: It could well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and under -- under State 

procedures, they're allowed to make the on-the-spot 

judgment. Would that -- would those facts suffice to 

allow them to enter without the knock? 

MR. MORAN: If they had specific information 

along those lines, that -- that there was evidence 

hidden in places or -- or stored in places where it 

could easily be disposed --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, is that correct? I 

thought in most States, there had to be a statute that 

authorizes a non-knock warrant. 

MR. MORAN: In most States --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And that most States do 

have such statutes. And we had this case because 

Michigan chooses to go on -- on a separate path. 

MR. MORAN: Most States do have statutes, but 

a few States by court decision have allowed for the 

issuance of no-knock warrants. My point --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Even -- even if Michigan 

doesn't, I mean, that has nothing -- as I understand

it, that -- that doesn't affect the -- the answer to 

the Federal question that we have because, as I 

understand it, we -- we can -- we can take as good law 

that even with a warrant that does not have a no-knock 

authorization, if the police have a justification for 

going in without knocking, so far as the Fourth 

Amendment is concerned, the search is still good. 

MR. MORAN: That's right. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that correct? 

MR. MORAN: Absolutely. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: So what we're really arguing 

is what -- what is Michigan law on the subject, but the 

-- the issue we've got is not Michigan law. 

MR. MORAN: That's right. And this case 

comes to us in the posture in which --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this is a -- this is a 

place -- a case in which the warrant was for drugs. Is 

that not so? 

MR. MORAN: It was. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, so in -- in this 

case, they could have entered in your view if they had 

specific knowledge of the gun and disposable 

contraband. 

MR. MORAN: Yes, after Banks and -- and 

Richards, especially Richards, if the police had

reasonable suspicion that you had contraband in a 

position where it could be easily disposed and if they 

had information about the weapons that could be used to 

resist the police entry, then yes, there could have 

been a -- a legal no-knock entry. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What about just the former 

without the latter? I thought the former alone would 

be enough. 

MR. MORAN: Either would be. That's correct, 

Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Going back to my question, 

isn't it then a reasonable assumption, based on the 

police experience in case after case, that where there 

-- where narcotics are housed, there is often a gun and 

there is ease of disposal, couldn't the police simply 

say this is a narcotics search and therefore we don't 

need to knock and announce because those circumstances 

will be present in most cases? 

MR. MORAN: No, because this Court 

unanimously foreclosed that argument in Richards v. 

Wisconsin by holding that there must be a 

particularized showing for the particular case. That 

particularized showing I will gladly concede will be 

easier to make in a narcotics case than it would be in 

a -- in a stolen property case.

 But it wasn't made in this case, and this 

case comes to this Court on the posture that the 

prosecution has conceded, at every step of the way, 

that that particularized showing was not made here and 

that, therefore, there was a knock and announce 

violation. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. A 

particularized showing of what? 

MR. MORAN: That in this particular case, 

it's likely that the drugs would be in an easily 

disposable situation and that the occupants would be 

armed and ready to resist the police entry. And there 

was no such showing made here. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I --

MR. MORAN: The prosecution didn't even 

attempt to make such a showing. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm vaguely recalling 

cases from the court of appeals in the D.C. Circuit 

that accepted a presumption that if there are drugs 

around, there are likely to be firearms around. Are 

you saying that that's inconsistent with the Richards 

decision? 

MR. MORAN: That might not be inconsistent, 

but the -- the -- to follow that up with, therefore, 

you can do a no-knock entry automatically is

The --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? 

As I understand it, the prosecutor conceded a violation 

of the knock and announce rule. 

MR. MORAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And I'm just wondering. In 

Michigan, since there's no adverse effect to it, do the 

prosecutors routinely concede that there's a violation 

because there's no point in litigating it I suppose? 

MR. MORAN: Well, I don't even think we get 

that far, Justice Stevens. Motions to suppress aren't 

filed. There's no point filing a motion to suppress 

except for the -- the fact that this case is pending in 

this Court. There's no point for --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So that if the issue 

arises, you can assume the prosecutor will always say, 

yes, we'll assume there was a violation. There would 

be no reason not to assume that. 

MR. MORAN: That's right. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: So you'll never really 

litigate in Michigan how far they can go before they 

violate the rule. 

MR. MORAN: It's a dead letter in Michigan. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But I assume that lawsuits

are allowable if -- if knock and announce is -- is not 

observed, and if you intrude upon someone in a state of 

undress. 

MR. MORAN: Michigan --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't a civil lawsuit 

bringable? 

MR. MORAN: Michigan has a particularly 

vigorous State immunity statute that makes it 

effectively impossible to sue for a -- a knock and 

announce violation. I have not found a single Michigan 

case in which anyone has successfully sued for a knock 

and announce violation. 

You can sue in Federal court under section 

1983, but there you run into various doctrines, 

especially including qualified immunity. 

I made the claim the first time and it still 

hasn't been contradicted by my opponents. We've not 

been able to find any cases, published or unpublished, 

in which anyone has collected anything other than 

nominal damages anywhere in the United States --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But those doctrines 

that you're talking about would be overridden on the 

hypothetical that you want us to be concerned about. 

In other words, you're saying if you don't suppress the 

evidence, there's going to be no incentive to comply

with the law. So they're going to deliberately violate 

the law. Well, if they're deliberately violating the 

law, qualified immunity isn't going to help them very 

much. 

MR. MORAN: Qualified immunity would still 

protect them to the extent that any reasonable officer 

could have thought that a -- a no-knock entry was 

valid. I cited a number of cases, for example, where 

innocent people have been shot following entries into 

wrong doors, and qualified immunity has been granted to 

the officers. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute. The 

government is not arguing here that -- that it's valid. 

It's just arguing that though it is invalid, the 

punishment for it should not be to let the criminal go. 

That's -- that's all they're saying. 

MR. MORAN: That -- that is their argument. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The punishment for the 

invalidity should not be the -- the inadmissibility of 

all of the evidence of the crime that was found. 

MR. MORAN: That --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's quite different 

from saying that it's -- that it's valid. So I think 

they acknowledge that -- that a lawsuit against an 

officer who knowingly dispenses with -- with knock and

announce because, as you say, he says there's --

there's no consequence, but there is a consequence. He 

can be sued. 

MR. MORAN: I assume --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And sometimes he may be 

going into the wrong house and the person suing him may 

not be a criminal, but may be some -- some innocent --

innocent bystander. 

And -- and what about -- you know, you say 

there's no incentive to knock and announce. There --

there may -- you don't know any Michigan cases in which 

a -- a civil suit has succeeded, but I know numerous 

cases in which police who -- who burst in without 

knocking and announcing expose themselves to danger, 

that is, to being shot at by a -- by a householder who 

doesn't know that they are the police. Isn't that 

enough of -- of an incentive, the fact that you may 

lose your life? 

MR. MORAN: No, Your Honor, because I think 

what some officers will do is exactly what Officer Good 

did in this case, which is shout police and then burst 

in immediately. So they'll do the announce part, which 

protects the police, to some extent, from being shot, 

but they will skip the rest of the knock and announce 

requirement, which is to wait some reasonable amount of

time to allow the householder to make himself more

You raise the point that lots of innocent 

people are subject to search warrants. Thousands of 

cases every year of -- of people who didn't do anything 

either --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I think you said the --

you thought the police here had to wait what? 15 

seconds? What was the figure you gave? 

MR. MORAN: Well, from Banks, this Court 

ruled that 15 seconds -- 15 to 20 seconds was an 

appropriate time for a drug search. 

JUSTICE ALITO: And now suppose they waited 10 

seconds. And so there would be a -- a constitutional 

violation? Why would suppression be appropriate in 

that situation? Why would it be in any way 

proportional to the -- to the violation that occurred? 

MR. MORAN: Well, if it was 10 seconds, 

Justice Alito, the government still might have an 

argument. 15 seconds was enough in Banks. The Court 

did not say --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, wherever the line is, 

suppose they're just -- they're just slightly on the 

wrong side of the line?

 MR. MORAN: I think as a practical matter, 

that if the police are just very slightly on the wrong 

side of the line, the courts are not likely to hold 

that there was a knock and announce violation. But 

when you have a flagrant violation like here --

JUSTICE ALITO: Then you're -- you're 

contradicting the premise. 

MR. MORAN: Well, in a case like -- in a --

if a court were to hold that the police did violate the 

knock and announce requirement by coming in -- by 

coming in, by not giving the person a reasonable amount 

of time to come to the door or to make himself 

presentable, then yes, the evidence should be 

suppressed because those officers need to be deterred. 

The -- the exclusionary rule is all about deterrence, 

and is there any method that will deter officers from 

violating the knock and announce requirement other than 

excluding the evidence by teaching them through example 

that next time you need to wait longer? You need to 

wait a reasonable amount of time for someone to come to 

the door unless you have facts suggesting that waiting 

a reasonable amount of time would defeat the purposes 

of the search. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What about -- you talk about 

deterrence. What about their not getting promoted? I

assume that -- that police departments, even if you 

have some maverick officers, that the administration of 

the police department teaches them that they have to 

knock and announce. Or if it doesn't teach them that, 

then you do have a 1983 cause of action against the 

city, not just the officers. And that -- you know, 

that's a deep pocket. 

MR. MORAN: I very seriously doubt officers 

such as Officer Good will not be promoted because of 

the violation that he committed --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Really? 

MR. MORAN: -- in a case like this. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you know, I'm the 

police commissioner and I have a policy that you -- you 

obey the law, you knock and announce, and -- and I know 

that this particular officer disregards it all the 

time. You really think that's not going to go in his 

record? 

MR. MORAN: I do, Justice Scalia, and I think 

it's inconsistent with Mapp in which the Court 

recognized that other remedies have proven completely 

futile in enforcing the -- the Fourth Amendment. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mapp was a long time ago. 

It was before 1983 was being used, wasn't it?

the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, one of the amici 

for the other side, concedes that tort remedies cannot, 

at this time, substitute for the exclusionary rule. 

If there are no other question, I'll reserve 

the balance of my time. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Moran. 

Mr. Baughman, we'll hear now from you. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. BAUGHMAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Justice Robert Jackson once said that when he 

was arguing cases before the Court, he always gave 

three arguments: the well-structured argument he 

rehearsed, the disjointed and confused argument he 

delivered to the Court, and the brilliant argument he 

thought of in the car on the way home. I have the rare 

opportunity to deliver the argument I thought of in the 

car on the way home. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. BAUGHMAN: But I'm going to refrain,

mindful of the fact that this is our -- our second time 

through and try to hone in on -- on what I think are 

some critical points. 

A search warrant, a judicial command, must be 

obtained from a neutral and detached magistrate. It 

must particularly describe the place to be searched and 

the things to be seized, and it must be issued based on 

probable cause drawn from information which is sworn to 

are affirmed -- or affirmed. If these requirements are 

met, the privacy of the described premises will be 

invaded, and any privilege the occupants might have to 

withhold evidence or contraband from the police is 

abrogated. 

But that command must be executed in a 

reasonable fashion. And so the police may not bring 

third parties into the premises who are unnecessary to 

the execution of the warrant. They may not search in 

places where the items described may not be found. 

They may not cause unnecessary damage to property, and

place, then -- and no exception exists, then the 

privacy of the dwelling has been unlawfully invaded. 

It never should have happened. But if a valid warrant 

exists and some error occurs in its execution, it is 

not the invasion of privacy which should not have 

occurred that is commanded by the warrant. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: And you -- you concede that 

there was error in execution here? You concede that 

there was a violation because -- technically because 

there was no knock? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you concede that? 

You've got a case in which, as I understand it, not 

only was the evidence but the warrant itself an 

indication not only that drugs were present, but that 

guns were present. It's perfectly true we don't have a 

general rule that anytime you do a drug search, you can 

do a no-knock, but in this case you had specific 

evidence that there were firearms there. And based on 

what I've seen in the case, I don't know why Michigan 

did not argue that, in fact, it was justified to go in 

without knocking. 

And I'll be candid to say you -- to tell you 

that the fact that Michigan does not make that argument 

suggests to me that Michigan is trying to structure a

case in which it's going to have the best shot to -- to 

get the exclusionary rule out of the way here. Why 

don't you claim that the search was lawful? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, let me first say this 

case was not structured to try -- to try to -- to get 

it here on our -- on our part. I think initially the 

prosecutor handling the hearing here reached the 

conclusion that Richards precluded an argument that a 

no -- that the failure to knock and announce was 

justified here. But --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Richards precluded a 

general rule, but it didn't preclude you from arguing 

in a specific case, and it's the fact that the 

prosecutor and, hence, all the way up the line to you 

do not argue that is -- is what I don't understand. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, again, I -- I think it 

would be an interesting argument to revisit Richards on 

this proposition. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't think we have to 

revisit Richards. I -- I think what -- what I'm --

what I'm concerned is that you don't make an argument 

based on the evidence in this case that you had 

probable cause to believe that there were going to be 

guns facing you when -- when you went in the door and 

therefore the knock was not required.

 MR. BAUGHMAN: Again, I think the -- the 

belief of the prosecutors, as the case went forward, 

was that because that belief, the -- you're correct. 

Guns were described as things to be seized in the 

warrant. The probable cause for that was not any 

specific knowledge about a gun in the house. It was 

the officer's general experience that when I execute 

search warrants for drugs, guns tend to be there. 

Richards seems to say, at least it certainly could be 

argued, that's not sufficient. You can't make that 

decision based on experience that drugs and guns go 

together. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, are you suggesting --

did -- did the warrant -- I don't know this. I should 

but I don't. Did the warrant authorize seizure of guns 

as well as --

MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes, it did. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- drugs? Well, are you 

suggesting that the -- the gun portion of the 

authorization was, in fact, invalid? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: No. I -- I don't because I 

believe probable cause can be based on the experience 

of officers --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

of the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- so -- in any case, at 

-- at the moment that you got the warrant, you -- you 

had, in fact, a -- a finding by a trial court, or a --

whoever the issuing magistrate was, that there was 

probable cause to believe that you were going to 

confront guns as well as drugs inside. And -- and 

Richards does not seem to me to be a good reason, under 

those circumstances, to concede that you didn't have a 

basis for -- for dispensing with the knock. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: It may not have been a good 

reason, but it was the reason in that the prosecutors 

believed that the rejection of the drugs and guns 

always go together as a justifying -- not knocking 

and announcing in Richards meant that the determination 

in this case that guns were on the premises based on 

the officer's experience that drugs and guns go 

together, not any specific knowledge about a gun was 

inadequate then to forgive knocking and announcing. 

That may have been a misjudgment, but it was a belief 

that Richards foreclosed that. It was not an attempt 

to set the case up. We had the Stevens case in 

Michigan. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, do you think

that there are guns on the premises, yes, absolutely. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: There's -- there's specific 

knowledge.

then they would enter without knocking. If -- if the

experience drugs and guns go together.

MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: All right. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: I would be happy to -- to, in 

a different case, make the argument that although 

Richards says a court cannot say that knock and 

announce is forgiven every time a drug warrant is 

executed on the theory that experience teaches that 

drugs and guns go together. I'd be happy to argue that 

that holding does not apply when a judge determines, in 

issuing the warrant, that drugs and guns go together, 

so I'm putting it in the warrant. I'd be happy to 

argue that case. 

At this time --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't argue it to me. It 

doesn't make much sense.

Richards couldn't be avoided by putting the drugs and 

guns go together into the warrant instead of --

Stevens and People against Vasquez have been decided, 

are there any cases, other than this one, in which a 

prosecutor has raised the knock and announce argument 

that got litigated all the way to the appellate court? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Yes, there have been a handful 

of cases where defense attorneys have filed a motion, 

despite People v. Stevens, and then they -- they have 

lost because of Stevens. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: So but there really is no 

incentive for the prosecutor to fight -- argue about 

this anymore in Michigan, is there? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: No. Not, in the criminal 

case, the prosecutor is responsible -- be, as it was in 

this case, although the judge refused to follow Stevens 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it concedes there's a 

violation. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: -- there should be no hearing. 

They're not conceding the violation. They're simply 

saying the -- a violation is irrelevant to the question 

of the admission of the evidence, so we should not 

litigate it. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: So there's no point in 

litigating it. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Exactly.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So it's a functional 

equivalent of conceding a violation in every case 

because there's simply no effective remedy. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Well --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No effective remedy in the 

litigation itself. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: In the criminal --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, there's always 

the possibility that the officer will be disciplined by 

his very zealous superior, I guess. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Or -- or civil litigation. 

There is no -- there is no exclusion. Yes, that's 

correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- do you dispute --

your -- your brother on the other side said in his 

argument that he had not heard a dispute about this. 

But do you dispute his claim that there has never been 

any -- at least in recent history, any -- any civil 

judgment actually rendered against anyone in the 

officer's position? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: I -- I am not aware of one 

from Michigan. I am aware that there have been civil 

judgments against officers from other jurisdictions. 

I'm not aware of one in Michigan. I know there have --

there are some suits that have been brought in the

Eastern District that are pending. And -- and part of 

the difficulty is civil suits can be brought. They can 

be settled. There can even be trials and damages 

awarded, and they won't be in the reports. They're not 

in the F.Supp.'s. They're not in the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But we don't -- we don't 

have any indication that there's an effective 

deterrence then in civil suits. Maybe there will be 

some day, but we haven't seen it yet in Michigan, I 

take it. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: I think one could also make 

the argument that that cuts the other way. The fact 

that there are not a lot of reported decisions may mean 

there's not a lot of violations going on, that the 

police are not routinely kicking down doors without 

knocking and announcing when they should, and that's 

why they're not being sued. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: And it may mean that -- that 

potential plaintiffs say if the courts are winking at 

this in the criminal case, we don't have much chance of 

getting a -- a verdict in a civil case. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: No. It's not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We don't know, but that 

might be the case too, mightn't it?

my experience that either -- either the criminals or 

certainly innocent parties, people -- probable cause, 

after all, doesn't mean certainty. People who have had 

damage done or physical injury occur have been -- are 

shy about suing the government in those circumstances. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any evidence that 

the citizens -- that Michiganders are less litigious 

than people in other States? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: That certainly hasn't been my 

experience and certainly not in my county. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so the mere existence 

of suits in other States ought to suffice as something 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that's -- that's a 

deterrent. Shouldn't it? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: I would -- I would think so. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I still don't understand 

where -- where we are with guns. You -- you have a 

specific finding in a warrant that says there's 

probable cause there's going to be a gun, and there's 

drugs. I take it your position is that this allows you 

to enter without knocking. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: It would be my position. I 

would have thought, as the prosecutor thought here,

that a probable cause finding that guns are in the 

house, based not on any specific knowledge about guns, 

but based on experience in similar circumstances, was 

not sufficient to satisfy Richards in terms of not 

knocking. I would certainly make the argument that it 

ought to be, but I would have not criticized the 

prosecutor, who didn't make that argument. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But why would you bother 

making the argument? The evidence can't be suppressed. 

I don't understand why -- why would there ever be any 

litigation over this issue in a criminal case? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: And -- and I think Your Honor 

is correct. The prosecutor's point in this case was we 

shouldn't litigate --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And can you cite me any 

other example of a -- a violation of the Fourth 

Amendment? Maybe we shouldn't have held it's a 

violation. I understand that argument. Is there any 

other area of Fourth Amendment law in which the 

violation of the Fourth Amendment is not followed by a 

suppression ruling? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, certainly. Let me give 

an example. One of the circumstances that I indicated 

that the police -- a manner in which the police must 

behave when reasonably executing a warrant is not to

look in places where the items sought cannot be found. 

If the police were searching a house for stolen 

computer monitors, a large object, and as they were 

searching for them, they opened the desk drawer where 

the monitor could not be and they shut it, and they 

found computer monitors in the home, the -- this Court 

has never addressed the question, that I'm aware of, 

but the law is uniform in the country that you would 

not suppress the computer monitors. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, now you're talking 

about other cases in other courts. I looked through 

with my law clerks 300 cases since Weeks, not Mapp, 

Weeks. That's what we're talking about, 1914. I 

couldn't find in 300 cases one single Supreme Court 

case that did not suppress evidence where there was a 

Fourth Amendment violation with one exception. The 

exception is there are sets of cases where deterrence 

is really not a factor. For example, good faith; for 

example, it isn't going into a criminal proceeding. 

Okay? 

Now, what I'd like you to do is to tell me if 

I missed some, which is certainly possible, or second, 

if you want us to change the rule and go back 300 years 

or 300 cases back before 1914, or are you going to tell 

us that deterrence doesn't play a role here or whatever

far as I can see it. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: It would be my position that 

in all of those cases, there was a causal connection 

between the evidence found in the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, there's a causal 

connection absolutely here. It is a but-for 

connection. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: This person being in the 

room and a child of 2 would know that if you get into a 

room, as a result of your being in that room, you're 

likely to find evidence. So it's both but for and it 

fits within the problem. There we are. 

That's the same, by the way, as it is with 

making a false oath to a magistrate. You make a false 

oath to a magistrate. That permits the magistrate to 

get into the house with -- the policeman gets in there 

with a warrant. It doesn't take the court long to 

suppress that. About a second. And -- and how -- how 

is this somehow different? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Let me try to give a couple of 

examples from different situations to make my point 

that there is a difference.

other cases as well. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No. We read Segura. We 

read Segura, which happens to be a case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: There was unquestionably, 

was there not, a violation of the Fourth Amendment in 

Segura? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Your Honor is correct, and I 

am confident that when the officers returned with the 

search warrant, with the officers already inside, they 

did not knock and announce when they when they returned 

with the search warrant.

 JUSTICE BREYER: He is not -- well --

Holmes says, of course, you don't keep it out then 

because that's not going to impact deterrence. Now, 

that's Segura. That's Silverthorne. That's case after 

case. Of course, I accept that. And if you can show 

that this case somehow fits within that chain, fine. 

Then I -- then I maybe appear I have my mind made up on 

this, but I'm open to change. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, let -- let me try a 

couple of examples that --

(Laughter.) 

MR. BAUGHMAN: -- that I -- that I hope might 

make the point. It is -- and my -- my belief is --

it's common in human experience that things can be 

accomplished either by command or by permission when 

the manner of doing so, the manner in which they end up 

being accomplished is subject to criticism. And let me 

give a couple quick examples. 

If, when she was young, I sent my daughter to 

her room -- and that was rare, but if I sent her to her 

room and she stomped up the stairs and slammed the 

door, she would be in further difficulty not because 

she carried out my command by going to her room, but 

because she stomped up the stairs.

 If a young athlete is told by his coach, 

catch the ball with two hands and he catches it with 

one, he is admonished not because he caught the ball 

but because he caught it with one hand. 

And if a football player taunts the opposing 

team as he crosses the goal line, he gets a penalty not 

because he crossed the goal line, but because he 

taunted the other team. 

These strictures are not prerequisites to the 

conduct. I do not tell my daughter go to your room but 

only if you don't stomp up the stairs --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. That's -- I -- I 

understand that point from your brief and I'm glad that 

you brought it up. But I have never -- I have never 

seen Fourth Amendment matters cut that finely. I have 

never seen the courts say I want to go back to the 

reason why this policeman is unlawfully in the room and 

then try to connect each piece of evidence with that 

reason. Rather, they ask is he unreasonably and 

unconstitutionally in the room. 

So my concern about that, which I'd like you 

to address, is if we took that approach, I think we'd 

be doing it for the first time, and we'd let a kind of 

computer virus loose in the Fourth Amendment. I don't 

know what the implications of that are. I can't tell

you what you're saying is illogical. It's not 

illogical. It's conceivable, but it strikes me as 

risky and unprecedented. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: I think as -- as -- in the 

examples I gave, knock and announce works the same way. 

These are not prerequisites. They're rules of 

conduct. They are principles of behavior. It's not do 

this only if you behave in this manner. It's do this 

and behave in this manner while doing it. And if you 

don't behave in the manner we have prescribed, the 

question is what flows from that misbehavior, not from 

the achievement of the end. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that your 

example it's -- stomping up the stairs is like failing 

to knock and announce. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: That's correct, and -- and the 

police are not illegally on the premises and my 

daughter --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And so there should be a 

deterrent for the stomping up the stairs, and you've 

got no deterrent for the knock and announce. 

MR. BAUGHMAN: Well, and part of what -- part 

of what I wanted to say also to Justice Breyer and I 

think also works here is it's -- the suggestion seems 

to be that knock -- that a Fourth Amendment violation

-- the question of whether one has occurred and the 

question of whether or not the -- to apply the 

exclusionary rule are one in the same. And this Court 

has never said that. To me that would be a dramatic 

changing of the law of this Court. This Court has 

always said those are separate questions, and I think 

Petitioner's argument conflates the two. 

We first ask whether there has been a 

constitutional violation and then we say -- this Court 

has said the premise for application of the 

exclusionary sanction is whether or not the challenged 

evidence is the product of the illegal government 

activity. So once we establish that there has been a 

constitutional error, the question becomes is the 

challenged evidence the product of it. And just like 

the touchdown is not the product of the taunting, the 

entry into the premises is not the product of the 

failure to knock and announce. It's the product of a 

warrant, which the judge issued commanding the police 

to enter. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't -- isn't the problem 

that in -- in fact, it's the product of both? The 

warrant alone does not get the police officer into --

into the building. It -- it is in fact the entry that 

gets the police officer into the building, the

execution of the warrant. The judge has to do 

something. The police officer has to do something. 

And the question that I think we face when we 

say is the later search the product of the entry, is --

is what your -- what -- I think a point that -- that 

counsel on the other side was making. It's a pragmatic 

point. Where do we draw the line of causation? And 

his answer is -- and I think the -- the answer of the 

cases that Justice Breyer was -- was referring to -- is 

this. We draw it in a way that will allow us to deter 

illegal police conduct, and if we engage in this 

slicing process of causation that you talk about, there 

will be no deterrent for the violation of the no-knock 

rule. If instead we say, yes, this is enough the 

product that we ought to deter -- that we ought to --

to respond to it in a way that will deter the no-knock 

and therefore we find causation and we get deterrence. 

What is fallacious about that argument? 

MR. BAUGHMAN: There's nothing fallacious 

about the argument if one accepts that excluding the 

truth in -- in a criminal proceeding is a fair tradeoff 

in that circumstance --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We do that every single time 

we exclude a piece of evidence in every suppression 

case, don't we?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT 

MR. SALMONS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

Suppression would not be an appropriate 

remedy in this context for two primary reasons. The 

first is if the knock and announce rule does not 

protect the individual's privacy interest in the 

underlying items seized and, instead, it seeks to limit 

discrete risks related to the execution of warrants 

that property will be damaged, that officers will be 

mistaken for intruders, or that occupants will be 

caught in embarrassing situations. That makes the

knock and announce rule similar to other Fourth 

Amendment requirements related to the manner of 

executing warrants such as --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what -- what do you 

say to Justice Breyer's argument that we haven't 

previously analyzed suppression by tracing or trying to 

trace the causal connection between a particular piece 

of evidence and a particular reason for the rule that 

was broken? What we have said in the past is if the 

rule or the standard is violated and the search is 

therefore unreasonable, the evidence doesn't come in. 

You're proposing a -- a different causal 

analysis. You're proposing a causal analysis that 

requires the connection between a piece of evidence and 

the particular reason for one of these standards in 

every case in which suppression is -- is requested. 

Number one, do you agree that that -- that 

would be a departure, as Justice Breyer suggested? And 

number two, what would be the justification for that? 

MR. SALMONS: It would not be a departure, 

Your Honor. In fact, that's common practice in the 

Fourth Amendment area. This Court, for example, in New 

York v. Harris looked to the purposes of the rule 

against arrest in the home absent a warrant and to 

conclude that it wasn't appropriate to suppress a

statement made at the station even though it assumed 

that there was but-for causation. And this Court in 

Cruz did a similar analysis. It's very common to look 

to the purposes served --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's common, when you have a 

chain of causal connection, to say it ends somewhere. 

It's common, and in Harris, it ended once they left the 

home and now they're over in the station. 

MR. SALMONS: But --

JUSTICE BREYER: This isn't over in the 

station. This is in the home. You speak of interests, 

but this doesn't interests. 

What about Boyd? I mean, the most famous 

statement in Fourth Amendment history to all invasions 

on the part of the government and its employees of the 

sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life. It 

is not the breaking of his doors and the rummaging of 

his drawers that constitutes the essence of the 

offense. But it is the invasion of his indivisible 

right of personal security, personal liberty, and 

private property. 

Now, I thought -- 1886 -- that's what's 

governed these cases for about 100 -- and far more, a 

century and a half or a quarter. And -- and the --

then suddenly you say, well, it's this interest in the

one or the other one. I mean, doesn't that describe 

it? 

MR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. I mean, 

certainly that's -- that is one of the principles 

underlying the Fourth Amendment, but this Court has 

looked to the types of considerations I'm discussing, 

and I will give you some examples. And we think, in 

fact, the knock and announce rule is very analogous to 

-- for example, to a claim of unnecessary property 

damage or to a claim that the officers brought the 

media along when they shouldn't or that they used 

excessive force. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's no doubt in 

here that an invasion of the home was authorized by the 

warrant. Right? 

MR. SALMONS: That's correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The interest we're 

talking about is not the sanctity of the drawers. It 

is 10 seconds that the officers should have waited 

additionally, according to the -- to your brother. 

MR. SALMONS: That's correct. The illegality 

JUSTICE BREYER: Correct? I'm sorry. That 

is correct? I -- I thought that this warrant does not 

say you can enter the house without knocking.

 I mean, I have a warrant. This warrant lets 

me search the house in daytime. I search it in 

nighttime. Is my search authorized? 

MR. SALMONS: I don't think that would be a 

warrantless search or I don't think that would be a 

violation. That might be --

JUSTICE BREYER: I have a warrant --

MR. SALMONS: -- of the manner of execution. 

But again, if I may --

JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what happens with my 

example? I'm curious. That's not a rhetorical 

question. 

I have a warrant which says, search 1618 5th 

Street. I search 1518 5th Street. Was it a warrant --

a warrant back search? 

MR. SALMONS: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't have a warrant to 

search 1518. I don't have a warrant that allows me to 

come in in the middle of the night when it says day, 

and I don't have a warrant here that allows me to come 

in without knocking. So where's the warrant? 

MR. SALMONS: I think the question in that 

case, Your Honor, would be about reasonable reliance on 

the warrant and whether it was a reasonable mistake. 

And if it wasn't, then it would be a warrantless

search. 

And if I may just focus the Court --

attention on the claim of unnecessary property damage. 

We think that's quite analogous here in part because 

the typical -- in the typical case, a premature or 

unannounced entry will be a forcible entry. But 

whether the claim is that the officers entered a few 

moments prematurely or that they unnecessarily used a 

battering ram on the door, in either case the -- the 

violation doesn't relate to the privacy interests and 

the items to be seized and shouldn't result in 

suppression. And in addition to that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it does relate to the 

privacy interests, and we've seen the explanation. One 

of the reasons for requiring the knock is that there is 

enough respect for a person's home, a person's privacy 

to say the police should not barge in like an invading 

army. 

MR. SALMONS: Well, that certainly is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That is a respect for 

privacy. 

MR. SALMONS: That -- that certainly is true, 

Your Honor, but that -- that is not a protection --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And that is involved -- and 

that is -- that is the whole point of -- of knock and

announce, isn't it? 

MR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. The point of 

knock and announce is a more limited privacy. It's not 

related to the privacy of the items to be seized. 

That's separate. And that's why it makes it like the 

claim of unnecessary --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We're talking about the 

privacy of individual in his home, and the 

reasonableness of the search depends upon the 

reasonableness of invading the individual's privacy in 

his home. Is that not the general rule? 

MR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. I think what 

-- what focuses in terms of suppression is whether the 

government has obtained an evidentiary advantage as a 

consequence of the illegality. Here, the illegality 

was the failure to delay a few additional moments 

before entry. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then there will never be a 

suppression of -- of evidence specified in a warrant 

when the warrant's no-knock component is violated --

MR. SALMONS: But --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- because we -- we will say 

-- in every single time, following your argument, you 

will -- we will say the -- the violation had nothing to 

do with the authorization to seize the evidence. The

violation simply had to do with the -- with the -- the 

niceties and the risks involved in entering. So if we 

accept your argument, no-knock is -- is a dead duck, 

isn't it? 

MR. SALMONS: I don't think so, Your Honor. 

If I may try to explain. I think as a general matter, 

with regard to physical evidence in the home that's 

within the scope of the search warrant, that you're --

you're probably right. Most of the time, that evidence 

will come in. 

We think that there are probably at least two 

areas that might lead to suppression in these cases. 

One is the -- the type of statements that the Chief 

Justice mentioned earlier. Another might be what you 

might call proximity evidence, that the officers went 

in prematurely and as a result, they saw a --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Salmons, may I ask you 

this -- this question? If you'd been the prosecutor in 

this case and you had -- knew that the evidence would 

be suppressed if there were a constitutional violation, 

would you have conceded that there was a constitutional 

violation in this case? 

MR. SALMONS: Well, I don't think -- I think 

there is a reasonable argument that could be --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes or no.

 MR. SALMONS: I'm -- I'm attempting to answer

argument that could be made in this case that there 

wasn't a violation. I think it was probably a smart 

strategy. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: So you would not have 

conceded. 

MR. SALMONS: I can't -- I can't second-guess 

the strategy here to concede it. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you would not have 

conceded. If you -- if you thought there was a 

reasonable argument, you would not have conceded that 

there was a violation, would you? 

MR. SALMONS: I think I probably would have 

argued in the alternative, Your Honor. I think that's 

probably the safest --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me what --

what happens if there's a violation of the daytime 

warrant provision in -- in a search warrant and the 

search is at night? Do we suppress? 

MR. SALMONS: I think generally no, Your 

Honor. I think -- and I would -- I would --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there cases -- are 

there cases on that?

-- there may be in the court of appeals. I think the 

way that the Court would analyze that would be, again, 

along the same lines. 

Now, certainly in jurisdictions that haven't 

adopted the rule that we're articulating here, the 

courts may suppress. But we think under the principles 

we're articulating, that suppression probably would not 

be appropriate there. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but apparently you're 

saying we would not suppress because as long as the 

warrant specified the items to be seized and they 

didn't go beyond that, there was no causal connection 

between the fact that they broke in and disturbed 

people in the night, when they were not authorized to, 

and their ultimate obtaining of -- of the evidence. 

Once again, it seems to me if we follow your -- your 

reasoning, then the distinction between the nighttime 

and the daytime warrant is a dead letter. 

MR. SALMONS: Well, you know, we respectfully 

disagree with that. We think that there are two 

separate questions, what the Constitution requires and 

whether suppression is an appropriate remedy. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: The Constitution requires --

MR. SALMONS: The Court has always treated 

those --

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The Constitution requires a 

reasonable search. It is hornbook law that violating 

no-knock, violating nighttime searches when only a 

daytime search is authorized amounts to an unreasonable 

search. You're saying that's utterly irrelevant 

because there's no causal connection between that 

violation and the seizure of the particular items that 

the warrant -- the warrant specified. 

MR. SALMONS: Your Honor, if I may. It's 

also hornbook law now in this Court that you can't 

unnecessarily destroy property in executing the warrant 

or effecting the entry and that you can't bring the 

media along. This Court in both Ramirez and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'd to get your -- I'd like 

to get your position. I -- I think Justice Souter is 

correct, that under the theory you're arguing to us 

here, the violation of the daytime warrant rule is not 

grounds for suppressing evidence. So we can have 

nighttime searches with no suppression remedy. 

MR. SALMONS: Well, I -- I think that's 

probably the position that we would take. I think the 

way the Court would analyze that, as it has done in 

these other cases, it would look to two factors. One, 

what are the purposes served by the Fourth Amendment 

rule that's violated and how well those purposes fit

with the remedy of suppression; and two, whether the 

government obtained any evidentiary advantage as a 

result of the violation. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

Salmons. 

Mr. Moran, you have 3 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. MORAN: Thank you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think there --

you think there was a violation of the knock and 

announce rule in this case. Correct? 

MR. MORAN: I do, Your Honor. The warrant 

was never actually made part of the record, but my 

understanding, from the record we have, was that only 

drugs -- there was only knowledge of drugs. The -- the 

warrant authorized a search for guns because Officer 

Good told the magistrate that in his experience guns 

were often associated with drugs. But they had no 

particularized information about any guns on the 

premises. They only had particularized information 

about drugs on the premises. 

The issue here about causation goes back, I 

think, to the common law. And as Justice Breyer 

articulated, when an officer is illegally in the home,

that causes his seizure of goods or his arrest of 

people in the home to be illegal. If I can go all the 

way back to 1831, Chief Justice Shaw of the 

Massachusetts Supreme Court said, the rule is well 

established -- this is 1831 it was well established --

that where an authority given by law is exceeded, the 

party loses the benefit of his justification and the 

law holds him a trespasser ab initio although, to a 

certain extent, he followed the authority given. The 

law will operate to defeat all acts thus done under 

color of lawful authority when exceeded and a fortiori 

will it operate to prospectively to prevent the 

acquisition of any lawful right by the excess and abuse 

of an authority given for useful and beneficial 

purposes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you draw a 

distinction between two cases? If they illegally 

entered and they suddenly said we waited 4 seconds, it 

was supposed to be 15. They say, never mind. They go 

back out. There's another knock. They wait 15 and 

they come in. Then it's all right. Correct? 

MR. MORAN: It might be. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. But you're 

saying it's a world of difference if, when they go in 

and enter and they say, we should have waited 10 more

seconds, we're the police, we're here to execute a 

search warrant, let's count to 10, then all of a 

sudden, it's invalid from there on. Those are the --

they're two different cases in your mind? 

MR. MORAN: I think that's -- that's right 

because an -- a reasonable search and seizure, as this 

Court held in Wilson, requires a lawful entry. Eight 

Justices agreed that an -- a lawful entry is the 

indispensable predicate of a reasonable search in Ker 

v. California. These are not disconnected. It is not 

in. 

The -- the prosecution's claim here, the 

Respondent's claim, would eliminate all manner of entry 

arguments from the exclusionary rule. Nighttime 

search, use of excessive force, blowing up the building 

to get in, knocking a wall off the building wouldn't 

matter. They were in -- they're in, they have a 

warrant, everything is fine once they're in. It simply 

wouldn't matter for exclusionary purposes. 

In Harris, I want to stress again in Harris 

that this Court never questioned the fact that the 

evidence found inside the home had to be suppressed, 

and that's all we're asking for here. The evidence in 

the home. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
