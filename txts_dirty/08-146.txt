 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 08-146, Arthur Andersen v. Carlisle.

 Mr. Baker.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. MILLER BAKER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BAKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The principal question before the Court 

today is whether nonparties to an arbitration agreement 

that are otherwise entitled to enforce that agreement 

under State law are foreclosed as a matter of law from 

seeking relief under section 3 of the Federal 

Arbitration Act.

 Respondents' argument that section 3 

forecloses such relief to nonparties is contrary to both 

the text of section 3 and the structure of the FAA. 

Nothing in the text of section 3 forecloses nonparty 

enforcement rights, and under the structure of the Act 

section 3 is a procedural device to enforce, rather than 

a substantive limitation upon, State law arbitration 

rights made applicable by section 2.

 I'll begin with the text of section 3. 

Under section 3, a stay is mandatory if the issue in

suit is, quote, "referable to arbitration under such an 

agreement." We contend that there are three elements 

that determine whether or not an issue is referable to 

arbitration under the agreement. First, the applicant 

must be able to enforce the agreement. Second, the 

plaintiff must be bound by the agreement. And, third, 

the claim must fall within the scope of the agreement.

 Nothing in section 3 limits who can enforce 

the agreement. To answer that question we have to turn 

to section 2.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Before you leave the 

text, it says as you -- "referable to arbitration under 

an agreement," but then it says "shall on application of 

one of the parties." How do we know whether that is 

parties to the litigation or parties to the arbitration 

agreement?

 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, it's -- it's clear 

from the -- from the context it's referring to parties 

to the action. Likewise, in section 4 there's a 

reference to parties, and it's parties to the 

controversy. So section 3 refers to parties to the 

action in which the section 3 stay is sought. Section 

4, likewise, the companion enforcement provision, refers 

to parties to the controversy.

the "controversy"? Is it the controversy asserted to be 

subject to arbitration or something else?

 MR. BAKER: Well, "controversy" is in -- in 

section 4, Your Honor, as opposed to section 3. But the 

controversy in this case is a tort claim against various 

defendants. And that -- the Petitioners in this case 

assert that they are entitled to enforce the arbitration 

clause, and under that clause this controversy is 

supposed to be arbitrated.

 Now, section 2 is the primary substantive 

provision of the Act. Section 2 establishes that 

questions concerning the enforceability of an 

arbitration agreement, including who may enforce that 

agreement, are decided by State law. This Court's 

decision in Perry v. Thomas recognized and applied this 

principle.

 In Perry this Court remanded to State court 

to decide the question of whether nonparties could 

enforce an arbitration agreement. In so doing, this 

Court instructed the lower court to apply State law to 

determine the very question that's before this case, 

whether non -- before this Court, whether nonparties 

could enforce the arbitration agreement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In practice, are there 

decisions in which -- and I'm assuming that you are

right on the jurisdictional question -- in which a 

nonparty to the arbitration agreement but a party to the 

litigation has, in fact, succeeded in getting a stay 

under section 3?

 I mean, one question is -- and that's the 

question on the merits -- assuming that a -- that a 

party to the litigation, not a party to the arbitration 

agreement, can come to court and say, court, stay the 

action pending arbitration. Have there been cases in 

which section 3 stays have been issued on the request of 

someone who is not party to the arbitration agreement 

but is a litigant in the case?

 MR. BAKER: Yes, there have been, Your 

Honor. And there -- there are numerous cases. In fact, 

for the last 60 years it has been a recognized, settled 

principle of FAA law that nonparties to an arbitration 

agreement that are otherwise entitled to enforce the 

agreement are able to seek and obtain stays under 

section 3.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the question --

ability is one thing. It means they -- they have the 

capacity to apply under section 3. I was just wondering 

how in practice -- I mean, here's a case where you have 

three parties together counseling a certain tax shelter. 

One of them enters an arbitration agreement with the

enterprise that they are advising. The other two, 

sophisticated players, do not.

 My question is, conceding jurisdiction, it 

seems to me unlikely that a court would listen to two 

such people who were perfectly equipped to get an 

arbitration agreement themselves and didn't.

 MR. BAKER: Well, Your Honor, it depends 

upon the facts and the law. It may well be that those 

nonparties have no arbitration rights, in which case a 

section 3 stay would not be available -- available to 

them.

 The question is whether they have rights 

under State law. If they do have rights under State law 

to enforce the arbitration agreement to which they are 

not parties, then they are entitled to a section 3 stay.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I don't see that the 

-- that the section 3 stay follows from that. It may 

very well be that in whatever ultimate forum the case is 

thrashed out in that the -- that the nonsignatories will 

be able to enforce the arbitration agreement.

 The question here is whether they can get a 

stay in midstream in order to litigate that as a 

separate issue. And one argument for saying that they 

should not, that the stay right should be limited to 

signatories, is that the policy of the -- the Federal

Arbitration Act is to enforce arbitration agreements. 

It is not a policy simply to promote arbitration under 

all possible circumstances. It is a policy to enforce 

contracts because the contracts, in effect, were being 

given short shrift before the act was passed.

 If the policy is one to enforce contracts 

and, as Justice Ginsburg said, they had a chance to make 

an arbitration agreement and they didn't do it, then 

that is a good reason to say the Federal courts will not 

stay the proceedings in midstream for somebody who 

didn't get the agreement that that person could have 

gotten. What is your answer to that argument?

 MR. BAKER: Section 2, Your Honor, sets the 

policy of the FAA, and section 2 establishes that State 

law determines the rights and obligations of nonparties 

to an arbitration agreement. If nonparties have rights 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Including -- and -- and 

you're saying that that covers, in effect, even a point 

of Federal procedure as to whether you get, in practical 

terms, an interlocutory appeal. That's a question of 

State law?

 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, that brings us to 

the question of appellate jurisdiction, but first let me 

deal with the merits. Section 3, as this Court has

recognized on various occasions, is a procedural device 

to enforce the substantive policy of section 2. It has 

no substantive component on its own.

 Section 2 establishes -- settles the 

question of who may enforce or is bound by an 

arbitration agreement. It settles that question by 

directing a court to look to State law. Section 3 is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And the question here is: 

What is the procedure to be followed in a Federal court 

when there is disagreement about that? And to say that 

that is a question of State law strikes me as a stretch.

 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, section 3 is a 

procedural device to enforce State law arbitration 

rights. Section -- likewise, section 4 is the same 

thing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say that section 

2 -- it isn't at all clear to me that section 2 says 

State law determines whether somebody not a party to the 

arbitration agreement can -- can enforce it.

 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, that was the reading 

of this Court in the Perry v. Thomas decision in 1987. 

This Court construed section 2 as being a touchstone for 

choice of law and that section 2 required the court 

concerning questions concerning the enforceability of an 

arbitration agreement to look to State law to answer

those questions.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Including enforceability by 

whom?

 MR. BAKER: Absolutely. That was the 

precise question before the court in Perry and this 

Court remanded to the California Court of Appeals to 

determine whether nonsignatories to an arbitration 

agreement could enforce that agreement. The California 

Court of Appeals on remand held that they could under a 

theory of agency, which is indistinguishable in 

principle from the theory that Petitioners are asserting 

here today.

 Respondents' theory, their interpretation of 

the Federal Arbitration Act, would wipe out six decades 

of FAA case law recognizing that nonparties have 

enforcement rights.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have any 

situation -- and this one is really peculiar because the 

one party who has the arbitration agreement with 

Carlisle is now out of it, and is not going to get back 

in, because -- is it Bricolage -- is bankrupt, so there 

is an automatic stay of any litigation against 

Bricolage.

 The one party that has the arbitration 

agreement is out of the picture, so you have an

arbitration agreement effectively with no one, that two 

parties who have no arbitration agreement are trying to 

enforce: The difference between parties to the 

litigation joining in an ongoing arbitration brought by 

either party to the arbitration agreement, and relying 

on an arbitration agreement effectively without two 

parties to it.

 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, the bankruptcy of 

Bricolage has no effect whatsoever on our rights under 

State law to enforce the agreement. It is what it is, 

but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you have a party 

to the agreement who is no longer in the picture, 

doesn't that change things?

 MR. BAKER: Well, the Respondents might --

might contend so, and they -- they are free to argue on 

remand the question of whether or not that bankruptcy in 

any way affects our rights, whether we can prevail under 

equitable estoppel in this case. But for purposes of 

this Court, the question that we -- that the Court has 

to decide is whether or not as a matter of law a 

nonparty is foreclosed from seeking relief under section 

3, and section 3 does not foreclose such relief because 

section 2 establishes the principle that this -- that a 

court is to look to State law to determine the question

of who can enforce an arbitration agreement.

 So we're saying that Respondents' theory of 

the case would wipe out 60 years of FAA case law 

recognizing that nonparties have arbitration rights. 

Theories such as third party beneficiary, assignment, 

agency, estoppel, including equitable estoppel, 

assumption, successor in interest, none of those cases 

can survive effectively if this Court were to affirm the 

decision of the Sixth Circuit.

 I will now turn to section 16 and the 

question of appellate jurisdiction. Respondents, like 

the court below, erroneously conflate the merits of the 

section 3 issue with appellate jurisdiction. Thus if 

you reject their interpretation of section 3, 

necessarily their appellate jurisdiction argument fails. 

But that -- their theory of appellate jurisdiction 

nevertheless should be rejected on its own merits.

 Under section 16, and that's found at page 3 

of the blue brief -- an appeal may be taken from an 

order refusing a stay of any action under this title. 

This establishes a broad category of orders that are 

immediately appealable. The Sixth Circuit below used a 

signatory test to determine whether it had appellate 

jurisdiction. Now, this test is legally erroneous, as 

the Respondents concede. For 70 years -- should be 80

years -- the Federal Arbitration Act has been understood 

not to contain a signatory requirement.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I ask you this? 

Let's assume State law said we -- we don't recognize 

stays at this stage of the game. Therefore, we will not 

give a stay to anyone. Would State law prevail?

 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, State law controls 

the question of who may enforce the agreement, who has 

rights and obligations under the agreement. Sections 3 

and 4 control the question of whether relief is 

available in Federal court. The procedural devices to 

enforce State law arbitration rights may vary from State 

to Federal Court, but the principle of who --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't that the problem? 

That's what I'm getting at. Isn't that the problem for 

you in this case? Because you keep arguing that their 

substantive rights under the agreement are issues of 

State law, but the question before us is not one of 

ultimate substantive right. At some point there will be 

an -- an appellate process open to them and they can 

assert those substantive rights if they didn't get them 

at trial.

 The issue here is not substantive right. 

The issue here is a procedural right, and it's a 

procedural right which depends upon the terms of the

Federal statute, and that's why it seems to me that it 

may very well be that the Federal statute determines not 

only the procedural right, the stay, but who may ask for 

it, that being a sensible Federal question rather than a 

State question.

 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, the premise of your 

question drives a wedge between section 2 and section 3 

that is inconsistent with this Court's -- Court's 

decision in Bernhardt. This Court in Bernhardt said 

that section 3 cannot be read apart from section 2. 

Section -- this Court has never characterized section 3 

or section 4 as containing any substantive elements. 

Such --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And your argument depends 

upon, as Justice Scalia pointed out a moment ago, 

reading section 2 as in effect incorporating State law 

for purposes of determining substantive rights.

 MR. BAKER: It absolutely does.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but that still begs 

the question whether the -- whether the incorporation of 

State law to determine substantive rights controls the 

question of what law determines procedural rights, when 

a Federal procedural right is claimed, which is what is 

involved here.

 MR. BAKER: That's -- that's correct. And

sections -- it is a Federal question as to what sections 

3 and 4 require.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And regardless of State law 

the answer to the Federal question is independent of it.

 MR. BAKER: That's not correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then I'm -- I'm missing the 

logic of your argument.

 MR. BAKER: The logic of the argument is 

that section 3 and section 4, as this Court has said on 

several occasions, are devices to enforce the principle 

of arbitration enforceability outlined in section 2. 

Section 2 establishes the substantive principle here. 

Sections 3 and 4 are mere procedural devices. Under --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But they are Federal 

procedural devices and State law could not contradict 

them. That's -- that's what we got into when I said 

what if State law said there could be no stay? You 

agree at that point that of course the Federal law would 

prevail?

 MR. BAKER: That would apply to -- that 

would apply to the question of the -- the action in that 

court, but in the Federal court the threshold --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It would apply to what the 

judge is supposed to do at that moment when somebody 

says, I want a stay. And the judge at that point

consults Federal law, not State law, doesn't he?

 MR. BAKER: That -- on the procedural 

question of what procedural mechanism --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, just stick to my 

question. He says: I want a stay. Does the judge look 

to State law or Federal law?

 MR. BAKER: The judge first looks to the 

question of who can enforce the agreement, and to ask 

that -- to answer that question, the judge has to look 

to State law.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why is that necessarily so? 

I don't understand your answer to that question, or your 

statement that your argument is dependent on the 

resolution of that choice of law issue.

 Are the courts of appeals unanimous on the 

question of whether the enforceability of an arbitration 

agreement by a nonparty is a question of State law? I 

think there's at least a Fourth Circuit decision that 

says it's a question of Federal law, but why -- why do 

we have to decide that and why is your argument 

dependent on it?

 Suppose that is, suppose that were a 

question of Federal law, what would that -- it might 

change the ultimate outcome of whether there's an 

entitlement to a stay, but I don't see why it has any

effect on a question of whether there is jurisdiction.

 MR. BAKER: I don't think it has any 

question -- effect on the question of jurisdiction, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Nor does it mean that you 

necessarily cannot enforce the arbitration agreement, 

does it?

 MR. BAKER: It means that -- well, you have 

to look to a source of law to determine whether a 

nonparty has rights under an arbitration agreement. I'm 

aware of that Fourth Circuit case. Your Honor, I 

believe that the court was incorrect. I believe this 

Court's decisions in Perry and ensuing cases make it 

clear that State law determines the rights and 

obligations of nonparties to an arbitration agreement. 

That's a settled principle. And so that is a threshold 

question that has to be --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you read section 

3, if you interpret, as you do, the word "parties" to 

mean parties to the litigation, then for purposes of 

jurisdiction the only thing is, is this person a party 

to the litigation? Yes. End of case; they can move for 

a stay. Then whether they're entitled to one because of 

this equitable estoppel theory which is determined by 

the State law is a merits question.

You are making a more complex jurisdictional 

argument than I understand. What's wrong with the 

simple argument that section 3 says parties; that means 

parties to the litigation; the -- the Petitioners here 

are parties to the litigation. Therefore, they can move 

for a stay of the arbitration. And then we go to the 

merits and say, do they have a good reason for staying 

the arbitration?

 But you're presenting a more complex 

argument on the jurisdictional point which I don't quite 

understand.

 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I'm not sure I 

understand the question. Are you referring to appellate 

jurisdiction or jurisdiction under the FAA?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: First, is there 

jurisdiction -- yes, appellate jurisdiction. If you --

if there's an application to stay, is that appealable? 

Why isn't -- why isn't the answer clearly yes?

 MR. BAKER: The answer, Your Honor, is 

clearly yes. If we're talking about --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your step -- you seem 

to be involving some merits question of State law in 

that question.

 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I turned to the 

merits first because the Sixth Circuit below erroneously

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You shouldn't do that. 

You should tell us, this is the jurisdictional argument. 

If we pass that threshold, then we get to the merits.

 MR. BAKER: All right. Well, I'll start 

with jurisdiction, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Good.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. BAKER: All right. Section 16 makes it 

clear that all one needs to have for appellate 

jurisdiction is a motion under section 3 for a stay 

pending appeal, and that is denied. That establishes a 

broad category of orders. The Sixth Circuit didn't 

apply that text. The Sixth Circuit used a --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask -- may I ask? 

Suppose it's somebody who has interest in the litigation 

but is not a party either to the arbitration agreement 

or to the litigation?

 MR. BAKER: If a -- if a party -- if a 

litigant makes a section 3 stay and they claim no right 

to enforce the arbitration agreement, that denial of 

that stay would be appealable, all right, because 

section 16 --

who is not a litigant, who can -- if somebody who is an 

interested spectator moves for a stay of litigation to 

which that person is not a party, and the court says of 

course not. Would that be reviewable on appeal?

 MR. BAKER: No, because they -- the 

spectator is not even a party, Your Honor, to the 

litigation. Section 3 contemplates parties to the 

litigation seeking a stay.

 On the question of appellate jurisdiction, 

if a litigant makes a request for a section 3 stay and 

the stay request is denied, there is clearly appellate 

jurisdiction under section 16. That is -- in our view.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's your 

jurisdictional argument.

 MR. BAKER: That's our jurisdictional 

argument. The mere request for relief under section 3 

and the denial of that request triggers appellate 

jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you're saying that's 

all that's before us because it was thrown out --

MR. BAKER: That's not all that's before 

you. The Sixth Circuit below conflated the question of 

whether there's appellate jurisdiction with whether non-

signatories can seek relief under section 3. That's why 

it's essential for the Court to reach the second

questioned presented, which is whether non-signatories 

as a matter of law are foreclosed from seeking relief 

under section 3.

 The court below -- I'll turn back to 

appellate jurisdiction to -- Your Honor. The court 

below used a fact-based test; that is, is the party 

seeking relief a signatory to the agreement? That --

that cannot be the law. Eighty years of FAA law 

establishes that you don't have to be a signatory to 

enforce an arbitration agreement. In addition, it 

violates this Court's rule that you look to categories 

of orders, rather than the facts of a given case in some 

appellate jurisdictions.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What are the instances in 

which somebody who is not a signatory might seem to have 

a right to enforce it? I can think of one. Suppose 

he's a third-party beneficiary of the contract. Are 

there others?

 MR. BAKER: Well, absolutely, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What?

 MR. BAKER: There's assignment, successor in 

interest, assumption, estoppel.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

 MR. BAKER: Well, Your Honor, it's a theory 

that was --

JUSTICE BREYER: I know what estoppel is in 

the law.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. BAKER: More precisely, it's equitable 

estoppel, but the -- the practice treatises have entire 

chapters devoted to --

JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but I haven't 

unfortunately had a chance to read all the practice 

treatises. So could you explain to me quite simply what 

is the theory of equitable estoppel that allows someone 

who is not a signatory to an arbitration contract to 

have it enforced?

 MR. BAKER: Yes, Your Honor. The theory 

here is that the Respondents asserted claims of -- of 

concerted misconduct, of conspiracy against the 

Petitioners, some of whom were -- one of -- well, none 

of whom were signatories to the arbitration agreement in 

Bricolage which did -- was a signatory to the agreement, 

that claim of concerted misconduct, in our view, where

the Respondents are relying upon the agreement, that is 

the agreement that they entered into with Bricolage to 

-- is a theory upon which they are now seeking relief 

from us. They are claiming that this contract that 

contains the arbitration clause was an instrumentality 

for the fraud that was perpetrated on them. Because of 

that they are now estopped from seeking, claiming that 

they are not -- not obligated to arbitrate under the 

agreement.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, whenever I 

sign a contract with anybody -- I sign one with Smith, I 

ask him to buy some wheat, I sell him some wheat, and 

there's an arbitration clause. And now I sue all kinds 

of other people, and the contract is part of the 

lawsuit. Are there many cases like that? Maybe it was 

a shipper, or something, who they sent the contract to, 

and he had to figure out what to do on the basis of the 

contract. Or maybe there was a cousin who told me to go 

to see Smith in the first place. Maybe -- I don't know. 

There are a lot of people. So, now all those people 

have to go to arbitration?

 Because you're saying whenever I go in and 

have a contract with X and there's an arbitration 

clause, then in any future lawsuit where I sue anybody 

and that contract is an essential part of it, the breach

thereof, he could put me in arbitration. Boy, that 

sounds extreme. I mean, I guess there are -- there'd 

have to be several treatises on this, but it doesn't 

sound intuitively sensible.

 MR. BAKER: Well, Your Honor, we're not 

saying that that applies in every case. There's more --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, okay. That's all I 

wanted to know is what's the theory in this case.

 MR. BAKER: The theory of equitable 

estoppel.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If that's the theory, I --

unless I think it always applies, I could just say I 

don't have to decide about a third-party beneficiary.

 MR. BAKER: Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: I just have to decide 

whether you can enforce it. Now -- so you'd better say 

some other things.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, one of --

MR. BAKER: Well, Your Honor, give me --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: One of the things you're 

going to say is that, with all due respect, Justice 

Breyer, this conflates the merits with the 

jurisdictional problem, which is exactly the mistake 

that the court of appeals made. Is that your theory of

 MR. BAKER: Well, that's -- that's the first 

error of the court of appeals, but the court of -- the 

second error of the court of appeals was to decide --

was to hold as a matter of law that section 3 does not 

allow nonparties to enforce an arbitration agreement.

 The question of the merits of equitable 

estoppel is not before this court, Your Honor, and it 

may well be on remand in the Sixth Circuit that --

JUSTICE BREYER: I wouldn't have asked my 

question if you hadn't said we have to go beyond the 

question whether they had jurisdiction and answer the 

merits, which is whether you can in fact enforce it.

 MR. BAKER: Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now you're saying, no, we 

don't.

 MR. BAKER: Your Honor, the merits -- there 

are two parts to the merits. The first is whether as a 

matter of law nonparties are foreclosed from seeking 

relief under section 3. That -- that is all this Court 

need decide. That is what the question --

third-party beneficiary example?

law?

Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

 The question of whether or not we satisfied 

the requirements of equitable estoppel is not before the 

Court. That's a question to be decided on remand by the

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. De MARCO

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. De MARCO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Estoppel is what you invoke when you have no 

contract to invoke, and this version of equitable 

estoppel is what you invoke when you have no arbitration 

agreement to invoke.

 I want to come to a question that was just 

asked by Justice Breyer. Section 3 mandates only stays 

in aid of contract-based arbitration obligations. They 

are not fungible, these arbitration agreements. They

cannot just be picked up by anyone and advanced as a 

ground for arbitration.

 This court has consistently said, in Volt, 

for example, at page 478: The FAA does not require 

parties to arbitrate.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I thought the first 

issue -- I never got past the first issue.

 MR. De MARCO: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And the first issue was, 

does he have a right to appeal? And I read the statute, 

and to me section 16 says yes. He asked for a stay. It 

was denied, and it says an appeal may be taken from an 

order refusing a stay. So there's an order refusing a 

stay; he appealed. Why can't he appeal?

 MR. De MARCO: Because the stay that he 

requested was distinctly outside section 3, not as a 

merits question, but so far outside question -- section 

3 that we can say he should not -- that the stay was not 

requested under section 3; it was not denied under 

section --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any -- is there 

any other example in the law -- I can't think of one --

where you say this party has so silly an argument, which 

is really what you're saying --

MR. De MARCO: Right.

JUSTICE BREYER: -- that we don't even let 

him appeal.

 MR. De MARCO: Yes. There are --

JUSTICE BREYER: It seems to me I've gotten 

a lot of appeals where the appeal, I don't think, is too 

meritorious, but nonetheless I never heard of saying you 

can't appeal.

 MR. De MARCO: Right. There are sort of 

what I would call the Trojan Horse appeals, where a 

party actually has moved to compel discovery and they 

characterized it as an injunction. When that was 

denied, they said: An injunction was denied; we have 

the right under 1292(a). The court of appeals is 

perfectly able to pierce that and say: No, that's a 

discovery motion; that's outside of the injunctive area.

 And here why we're saying this, Your Honor, 

we recognize what they say about the Behrens case. This 

is an instance where we're asking the Court to, in a 

sense, pull the veil on these section 3 --

JUSTICE BREYER: As to that, if you did 

that, I got your first point. I understand it. I agree 

with it.

 As to the second point, you say -- I was 

surprised because I hadn't quite taken that in -- that 

we are now supposed to reach what we would call the

merits of the appeal. Now, there you just heard your 

co-counsel say: Look, you don't have to decide whether 

my equitable theory is good or not. You haven't read 

the treatises, I have; which is a fair comment. And --

and all I want you to say is that sometimes, at least, a 

third party could enforce a contract to arbitration that 

two others make.

 The statute doesn't say he can't. The 

statute doesn't say he has to be the one who signed it. 

And if you think of a third party beneficiary or an 

assignment, for example, you would think, of course, 

there are other people, say an assignee, who could 

enforce it.

 MR. De MARCO: Right. And there's a reason 

why those -- in those cases, the third -- I will call 

them nonparties were allowed to enforce. Let me preface 

that by saying not all of those were -- we've heard a 

lot about State law and Federal law. Not all of those 

are tightly grounded in Federal law.

 But take your example of the third party 

beneficiary, they cite a case called J.P. Morgan in 

which the woman was incompetent, the agreement with the 

nursing home was signed as -- on her behalf. I think 

that's clear in that kind of case that the nonparty is 

asserting the right through the contract, because of the

contract, dependent on the contract.

 Here, by claiming equitable estoppel not 

only aren't the Petitioners asserting rights that flow 

to them from the contract, because they have no 

contract; they are actually saying -- this is the gist, 

it gets back to your question, what's the gist of their 

equitable estoppel theory. It's as we quote in footnote 

13: The gist of it is that equitable principles prevent 

Respondents from claiming that they have no obligation 

to arbitrate with the Petitioners despite the lack of an 

agreement.

 Their very theory assumes that what section 

3 says must exist is absent. Their very theory says we 

don't have an agreement of our own to assert, and 

therefore, we need equitable principles to fill the 

void. Now, where do these equitable principles come 

from?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you might say that 

they haven't stated a claim on which relief can be 

granted, but that is the merits question. We are 

supposed to be dealing with the question of whether the 

denial of the stay -- there was a denial of a stay -- is 

appealable under section 16. And to decide that 

question I don't think you get into how meritorious 

their claim was for the stay.

MR. De MARCO: Your Honor, the fact that 

they have filed a motion, and as I referred to it, the 

concern that we have, and I think the concern that 

animated DSMC and Universal when they took up this 

issue, was the Trojan Horse stay motion. We have to 

keep in mind not every stay that is filed pending 

arbitration, a stay pending arbitration is necessarily 

filed under section 3, because in footnote 23 of Moses 

H. Cone this Court recognized another kind of stay 

pending arbitration, and that's a discretionary stay.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. And what is the 

criterion for identifying a section 3 stay?

 MR. De MARCO: The criterion, Your Honor, is 

that the right to the stay must be -- the right to --

the statute speaks in terms of referable to arbitration 

under an agreement. What does that mean? "Referable to 

arbitration" is the arbitration obligation. "Under" in 

that means dependent on, because of. So the 

arbitrability of it depends on a written agreement.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And your -- and your 

position is that the statute should be so construed that 

only a signatory to the written agreement has a right to 

the stay, indeed has a right to request the stay under 

article 3?

 MR. De MARCO: Yes.

JUSTICE SOUTER: What is your reason for 

saying that?

 MR. De MARCO: Just to clarify, the statute 

being section 3.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. De MARCO: Yes. The reason for that is 

this Court has been very clear in its interpretations of 

the FAA in general. The FAA in general, the Court has 

said, requires -- does not require parties to arbitrate 

when they have not agreed to do so. So that sets the 

standard. If there is no agreement, you cannot force 

that signatory, which didn't have an agreement with that 

nonsignatory, to arbitrate.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what do you do with 

third party beneficiary assignment assumption?

 MR. De MARCO: All of those examples, 

Justice Kennedy, in all of those examples the right to 

enforce the agreement, let's say the right to procure a 

stay based on the agreement, flows from the intention of 

the parties to the original agreement.

 The examples they use -- assignment, they 

cite a case where there is -- there was an express 

assignment, and in the assignment the Court said they 

actually assigned the agreement with the arbitration 

clause in it to the successor. They cite an assumption

case. It was an express signed assumption. Those are 

all cases of contract-based arbitration.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, in a way that was 

where one of the parties, without the other party's 

consent, say assignee, a third party beneficiary. Here 

in a way it's a fortiori because the party who is 

objecting, his or its own actions caused the agreement 

to come into play. That's their theory.

 MR. De MARCO: Well, let me tease that out a 

bit. The -- one of the -- the problems in this area, 

this equitable estoppel that has developed as an ersatz 

form of equity principle, it is not tied to section 3 

nor is it tied to State law. It is -- it is perfectly 

ad hoc, so it's an amorphous concept that we've seen 

develop over the last --

JUSTICE BREYER: Your proper -- I see this 

is actually a pretty difficult question to me, and --

because it seems to me sometimes they have to be able to 

enforce it, the assignee, the third party beneficiary.

 MR. De MARCO: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And now what I don't know, 

is what they're doing, it's true that section 3 and all 

the other sections, they talk about the agreement, but 

they don't say that the individual who is asking for the 

stay has to be the same person who signed it, as they

couldn't. So how do we know which among all the 

possible people in the case who hasn't signed it should 

and should not be able to enforce it?

 Their argument is look to State law, okay? 

And your argument is derive some principles yourself. 

Really.

 MR. De MARCO: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And so, so -- is it 

possible to answer this case by saying he's wrong in 

thinking you always look to State law. It may depend on 

what the State law says. So that's the answer to the 

question. You should have had your appeal. Go appeal, 

and let the courts below work that out first, knowing 

that the State law is relevant but not always 

determinative. Then we'll get some -- we'll get some 

case law on this and we'll be in a better position to 

figure out what the right answer is.

 MR. De MARCO: Justice Breyer, the question 

of arbitrability does not always depend on State law. 

In Volt, in first options this Court said sometimes it 

does, but it does when the issue is, was a contract 

formed, is a contract valid. How are we going to 

interpret that contract?

 Here where equitable estoppel is concerned, 

that's not the consideration. Therefore, because you

can -- you can interpret the contract until the cows 

come home, you're never going to find the Petitioners in 

it. So that the question --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you see it's a little 

hard. I can imagine a case where they're sitting in the 

room drawing up the contract, they put it in the 

arbitration agreement. There are four other people 

directly related to the room. The parties look around 

and say, hey, we have arbitration here, I hope everybody 

understands everybody is going to have to do this. And 

they all say, okay, don't worry about it.

 Now, I would say, hey, maybe they're 

estopped. And there they're going right through the 

contract.

 MR. De MARCO: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So I hate to write the 

words "equitable estoppel is never relevant." I would 

rather write the words "I'm uncertain State law is 

relevant policy." You know, it's not true that it's 

always relevant.

 MR. De MARCO: I think the safest ground is 

to clear up first this question of how arbitrability is 

decided. And I think Justice Alito asked the question: 

Is -- is there unanimity among the courts of appeals.

was mentioned, I believe that's the Bailey case. I 

don't even think there is unanimity, unfortunately, 

within the Fifth Circuit. But there -- the -- the 

better view, I think, that is expressed in the Fourth 

Circuit case is that when the issue that's pivotal is 

contract interpretation, arbitrability in that narrow 

sense, that's State law. When it's not, it's Federal 

law.

 And I think that's why you see these 

equitable estoppel cases not talking at all about State 

law. It is sort of an ersatz, ad hoc version of Federal 

equity that's being --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Why shouldn't the 

Federal law be even simpler than that? And I -- I 

proposed one, and -- and probably because I don't 

understand the law well enough, it may -- may have been 

simply simplistic.

 But my suggestion was the -- the issue 

before us should be construed narrowly as being the 

question of who can ask for a stay. And the answer to 

that would be only a person -- or one possible answer to 

that would be only a person who has signed the 

arbitration agreement, because the Federal policy is to 

enforce agreements, not force arbitration. And, 

therefore, it is sensible as a matter of Federal policy

to say, we're not going to stop this trial in mid-track 

for arbitration unless you who are asking for it to be 

stopped signed an arbitration agreement yourself, and 

it's that agreement that you're trying to enforce.

 Now, that is maybe a -- a too simplistic 

approach, but tell me what's good or bad about that.

 MR. De MARCO: I think that it's the correct 

approach to say that we are not talking generically 

about the enforceability of arbitration agreements. We 

are talking in the context under section 3 of an 

existing lawsuit. That one party says, hey, I want to 

stay this lawsuit. So it is a different enforcement 

mechanism than -- than the -- than the generic law.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. That opens the door 

to my simplistic theory. Now --

MR. De MARCO: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- is it a good theory or a 

bad theory?

 MR. De MARCO: It's a good theory because 

then, once you've opened that door to the -- the ability 

to ask for a stay, you must ask: Well, what are the 

ground rules for asking for this stay?

 And while my friend continuously returns to 

State law, our point is you don't depart from the terms 

of section 3 itself, because section 3 itself tells you

the circumstances under which the mandatory stay 

provision applies. And those circumstances are only 

when it is referable to arbitration under a written 

agreement.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But it seems to me 

that that's not enough, because "under the written 

agreement" leaves open the question of whether the 

written agreement can be enforced right here and now by 

getting a stay only by somebody who signed it or by a 

third party beneficiary or -- or somebody dependent on 

the contract plus some other legal theory.

 My simplistic suggestion was: Keep it 

simple and simply say the -- "under the agreement" means 

an agreement signed by you, and the reason we confine it 

to an agreement signed by you is not because the phrase 

"under this agreement" tells us that. It doesn't. That 

leaves the question open.

 We say it is going to be confined to an 

agreement signed by you because that's really the -- the 

nub of the Federal policy. We want to enforce 

agreements, and we want to confine this extraordinary 

remedy of a stay to people who went to enough trouble to 

make -- and I don't know whether that's a good idea or 

not. And -- I mean it's favorable to you, so it's in 

your interest to say it's a good idea, but I may be

getting into trouble by that. And that's what I want 

you to tell me.

 MR. De MARCO: Well, that's consistent with 

the Federal policy as this Court has expressed that 

Federal policy. It has -- it has said repeatedly the 

Federal policy is not a general policy to encourage this 

form of dispute resolution but, rather, it is to give 

effect to parties when and if they agree to arbitration. 

So I agree that that is, and should be, the starting 

point of the analysis. Is -- and -- and it was 

expressed in -- in Mitsubishi this way: That -- that 

the intent of the FAA is to give effect to arbitration 

agreements, to put them on an equal footing with all 

other agreements, but not more so. And I believe what 

-- what Petitioners are asking for is a "more so."

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. De Marco, can I ask 

you this question? In section 3 do you agree with his 

reading of the word "parties," or do you think "parties" 

just means parties to the contract?

 MR. De MARCO: With my friend's reading?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. De MARCO: Justice Stevens, I have to be 

honest and say I'm concerned about that argument because 

I think Congress has used the word "parties" throughout 

the FAA rather haphazardly to mean three different

things, maybe four: Party to the agreement, party to 

the action, party to the arbitration, or party-like 

person. And I would be concerned about hanging it on --

on that. So my -- my answer is, because of the way it's 

used in sections 3, 4, 5, 9, I would be concerned about 

-- about resting on that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You are concerned about --

does that mean you agree with him that "parties" means 

parties to the action and not parties to the contract?

 MR. De MARCO: I -- actually in section 3 

what I would say is it's equivocal, and the rest of the 

FAA doesn't help us understand that. So it's an -- it's 

an issue on which I would not hang my hat, because it is 

equivocal.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What would you think about 

saying that some parties -- some parties to the case who 

are not parties to the contract can as third parties, 

nonetheless, enforce arbitration? We have listed a few 

examples, assignees, et cetera. When considering 

whether this is one of them, judge, the key question --

we can tell you what the key question is and what it 

isn't. What it is has to do with the intent of the 

persons who did sign the contract.

 MR. De MARCO: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Something related to that.

We don't have to be specific.

 MR. De MARCO: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What it isn't is a case 

management device. Because what I think the temptation 

would be for the judge is to -- is to -- let's send them 

all off to arbitration if we can, and then I would not 

have to worry about this case for a while. And come 

back, and I'll figure it out.

 MR. De MARCO: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So is that -- is that 

right, or is it wrong? What's your insight or guess on 

that?

 MR. De MARCO: I think it's -- it's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm just looking for ways 

of separating these sheep from goats.

 MR. De MARCO: Yes. The only way, I think, 

to give effect to what the Court said, which is nobody 

is going to be forced to arbitrate when they haven't 

agreed to arbitrate, is for judges to take section 3 

seriously when it is proffered as the basis for a stay 

motion and to -- and to apply it as --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You -- you just told us 

that section 3 was ambiguous. You don't know if the 

reference to "parties" means parties to the arbitration 

agreement or parties in the litigation. So how can we

take it -- we take it seriously, yes, and say there's an 

ambiguity. We don't know from the text which is the 

proper reference, parties to the agreement or parties to 

the litigation.

 MR. De MARCO: Justice Ginsburg, by 

declining Justice Stevens's invitation of sorts to read 

"parties" a particular way, I did not mean to -- to 

suggest that the referable -- issue referable to 

arbitration under a written agreement is ambiguous. I 

don't think that's ambiguous.

 I think as applied here in this case it's 

clear that the -- the Petitioners' claim of 

arbitrability does not flow, to use Justice Breyer's 

terms, from that which the parties to the Bricolage 

agreement intended. They don't claim that the parties 

to that agreement intended for them to be covered, as 

would be the case with a third-party beneficiary or --

JUSTICE ALITO: If the "parties" in -- in 

section 3 means parties to the arbitration agreement, 

would that mean that a -- someone who is not a party to 

the litigation could file a stay motion under section 3, 

someone who is not a party to the litigation but is a 

party to the arbitration agreement?

 MR. De MARCO: If it were limited to parties 

to the -- if it were interpreted as parties to the

arbitration agreement, then it would suggest that a 

party outside the litigation -- let's say a party that's 

conducting an arbitration pursuant to an arbitration 

agreement could intervene.

 That's what happened in DSMC. The -- the --

one of the contracting parties intervened and said, we 

are engaged in this arbitration. We want you to stop 

this, what had been claimed to be, nonarbitrable 

litigation.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, once they intervene, 

they are a party to the litigation as well.

 MR. De MARCO: Pardon me?

 JUSTICE ALITO: Once they intervene they 

are.

 MR. De MARCO: There I think it was for the 

limited purpose of seeking a stay. I -- I take your 

point, though, that -- I -- I think we have to be 

careful in -- in judging the -- a stay motion, to focus 

on the language of section 3 under the under-written 

agreement language, and when -- when that is the focus, 

I think it's clear that theories such as equitable 

estoppel, an outlier among all those theories that were 

listed, assumption, assignment -- an outlier among 

them -- uniquely says that despite the lack of a written 

agreement to arbitrate, equity requires; equity says it

should be arbitrated. That -- that I think is 

incompatible with the language of section 3.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you would recognize 

that there is some appeal possibility, because you 

already said or at least you said in your brief that the 

12 might -- let's get this question settled about the 

equitable estoppel and going to arbitration; That the 

district court in its discretion that could give a 

1292(b) order and say I want to get this issue settled 

on appeal before I go on with the case.

 MR. De MARCO: Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would be all right.

 MR. De MARCO: There is an appellate pathway 

and that is 1292(b). That has always existed for 

discretionary stays. I think it applies when a party 

attempts, perhaps labels its motion a section 3 stay, 

but misses the mark by not truly grounding it in 

section 3. When it misses the mark, their outlet --

their pathway to interlocutory appeal ought to be 

1292(b), particularly because section 16(b) indicates 

Congress felt that was a compatible accommodation in the 

stay -- in the arbitration context.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well -- the district 

judge could say, I'm going to treat this as a 1292(b) 

issue, and I'm going to grant the stay so that the court

of appeals can tell -- can tell me what the law is?

 MR. De MARCO: That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. I want to be clear that the rule we propose 

as to these claimants asserting equitable estoppel does 

not preclude them from seeking a stay, even based on 

equitable estoppel. And the best example I can give you 

is one in the D.C. Circuit, in the post-DSMC era. 

There's a case called Toledano in which the party was 

asserting exactly the same theory that -- that 

Petitioners are, equitable estoppel entitles us to a 

stay. And what the court said there is well, DSMC has 

come down and said you cannot under section 3 predicate 

a stay on equitable estoppel, because you are by 

definition saying I am not subject to a written 

agreement; that's the predicate for section 3.

 So what the District Court said in that 

State -- in that case, it entertained the stay as a 

discretionary stay, and it granted it. It granted it on 

the very same ground that my friend is insisting should 

be the ground for a mandatory stay in the post-DSMC era; 

it's a basis in the District of Columbia for a 

discretionary stay. It worked exactly the same way.

 The difference was you -- you were true to 

the language of section 3 and you were true to the 

language of section 16(a)(1)(A); you don't have the

runaway stays in the D.C. Circuit that you have in the 

Fifth Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit and to some 

extent in the Fourth Circuit; and you don't have the 

interlocutory appeals from those except under 1292.

 I want to come back to a -- to a question 

that was -- that was asked by Justice Ginsburg about 

Bricolage. If Bricolage were, let's say, back in the 

picture, or does the fact that Bricolage is out of the 

picture make a difference?

 The only sense in which an issue in this 

case was ever referable to arbitration under an 

agreement in writing is under the Bricolage agreement. 

Once Bricolage departed the case, that obligation that 

Respondents may have had to arbitrate with Bricolage 

became inoperative, and what I see Petitioners 

attempting to do is to disaggregate that the obligation 

that Respondents undertook to arbitrate with Bricolage 

from Bricolage's reciprocal obligation, detach it, and 

run away with it as if it's a fungible commodity and say 

we are now owed this obligation, when -- contrary to 

everything this Court has ever said.

 That's not the way the FAA works, because 

with the FAA the starting point as this Court said in 

Mitsubishi is did the parties agree to arbitrate that 

dispute? And if we're talking about the -- the absence

of Bricolage, I think we're -- we're dealing with a case 

where even among the equitable estoppel cases, this case 

will turn out to be an outlier because of Bricolage's 

absence.

 I say that because we're also dealing with 

accountants who were their accountants for 25 years 

before Bricolage came along. We're dealing with a law 

firm that had a written retention agreement, had a 

contract with them and didn't think to put it in that 

contract, saying, "oh, pay no attention to that, let me 

show you this contract that they signed with someone 

else."

 It gets back to Justice Breyer's point: If 

I -- let's say I unilaterally published in The 

Washington Post, "I am through with litigation, 

henceforth I will arbitrate every dispute with every 

other human being that I get involved in." That's not a 

section 3 agreement to arbitrate.

 Agreement imports the notion of an exchange 

of arbitration obligations, which we do not have here. 

Bricolage is gone. There's no question that the premise 

of this equitable estoppel argument is the absence of a 

-- of an agreement to arbitrate should be overlooked 

because of equity.

compel, it did move for a stay, did make a section 3 

application; and then it -- it became bankrupt and got 

the benefit of the automatic stay in bankruptcy.

 MR. De MARCO: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I take it that 

Andersen and Curtis are saying we have a right to be 

substituted for Bricolage. That's --

MR. De MARCO: That's what their -- that's 

apparently their argument, and the problem is how do 

they fill that gap. They attempt to fill it with State 

law. I think State law does not apply, the language of 

section 3 applies, Your Honor, and section 3 cannot get 

them there from here.

 MR. BAKER: Thank you, Your Honor.

 The question of appellate jurisdiction, the 

Petitioners here made a motion for relief under section 

3, and that motion was denied. Therefore there is 

jurisdiction under section 16 to reach the question of 

whether we were entitled to relief under section 3.

concession that decides this case. Respondents concede 

that under section 3 nonparties can enforce an 

arbitration agreement through the mechanism of section 

3. That decides this case. This case should be 

remanded to the Court of Appeals to decide the question 

of whether on these facts, these nonparty Petitioners 

can actually enforce section 3.

 The Petitioners' quarrel is with the 

doctrine of equitable estoppel. They don't like it, but 

there's nothing in the text of section 3 that allows 

this Court or any court to distinguish between the 

various doctrines or legal theories that nonparties may 

seek to which -- to enforce section 3. We happen to 

have used section 3, happen to have invoked equitable 

estoppel as the basis for invoking section 3, but it 

could have been assigned and it could have been a third 

party beneficiary.

 They have -- Respondents have conceded the 

principle that section 3 is available to provide relief 

on nonparties who are otherwise entitled to enforce the 

agreement. They just think that on the merits we don't 

satisfy the requirements of equitable estoppel. That's 

a question to be decided on remand. Equitable estoppel, 

I will say very briefly, presupposes the existence of a 

written arbitration agreement. In the absence of a

written arbitration agreement, Petitioners here would 

not have any ability to assert this theory of equitable 

estoppel. So -- so it's not completely separated from 

or detached from the existence of a written arbitration 

agreement.

 I would like to turn to Justice Souter's 

signatory test for allowing relief under section 3. 

With all respect, this defies 80 years of case law 

interpreting the Federal Arbitration Act. It defies the 

history of the Federal Arbitration Act. It's settled 

that Congress in enacting this Act, chose New York law, 

and the New York arbitration act lad a much more 

stringent requirement for arbitrating existing disputes 

which required a signature.

 Congress, as we outlined in our brief, did 

not choose that section of the New York law as a model 

when it enacted the FAA in 1925. 1292(b), the right to 

appellate jurisdiction is illusory because that is 

denied; a nonparty with arbitration rights be forced to 

litigate and lose the very things that arbitration is 

designed to avoid -- that is, the cost and time of being 

in litigation in a district court. Not only that, the 

District Court will suffer the loss of judicial 

efficiency by having to litigate -- litigate a case 

before it or adjudicate a case that should be in
