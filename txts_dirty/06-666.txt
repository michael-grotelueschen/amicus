 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 06-666, Department of Revenue of Kentucky 

v. Davis.

 Mr. Trower.

 ORAL ARGUMENT of C. CHRISTOPHER TROWER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. TROWER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Kentucky's tax exemption for municipal bond 

interest paid by Kentucky and its political subdivisions 

to Kentucky taxpayers treats all private entities the 

same, and favors only Kentucky and its political 

subdivisions. This Court has never held that a law 

which favors government, whether the State or local 

government, rather than private business enterprises 

violates the dormant Commerce Clause. 

The Court's decision last term in United Haulers holds 

that State laws which favor government but which treat 

all private business entities in State and out of State 

the same does not discriminate against interstate 

commerce.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is what you just said true 

about conduit bonds, where Kentucky issues bonds to

finance private construction? Is the statement that you 

just made accurate?

 MR. TROWER: Yes, it is, Your Honor. 

Private activity bonds, a subset of which are conduit 

bonds, account for approximately 20 percent of all 

municipal bonds issued. And I think your question has, 

has two point to it.

 First of all is whether or not a State or a 

municipality ought to be able to use its tax exempt 

borrowing power to further a project chosen by the 

municipality to achieve public purposes, such as for 

example tax exempt hospitals or other facilities that 

are tax exempt, should it be able to use that tax exempt 

borrowing power constitutionally? The answer there is, 

yes. Congress has already made that decision.

 The second question is whether there's a 

Commerce Clause problem if a State exempts it's own 

private activity bonds but taxes private activity bonds 

issued in other States?

 JUSTICE ALITO: That's what you do, isn't 

it?

 MR. TROWER: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Doesn't that raise, in 

effect, sort of a distinction between Carbone and United 

Haulers? Or at least one way of understanding the

distinction between those two cases? In Carbone the 

facility, in fact, was not the facility of the 

government.

 MR. TROWER: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Here the, the immediate 

beneficiary of the bonds is, in Justice Alito's hypo, is 

a private entity?

 MR. TROWER: That's correct, that the 

immediate beneficiary of the bonds or of the loan is a, 

is a nongovernmental entity. It's not necessarily a 

private business.

 As we point out in our reply brief, 80 

percent of all private activity bonds go for --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- correct me if I'm 

wrong, just a matter of fact. I thought in most 

instances the immediate beneficiary would be a private 

entity who, in effect, was enabled to borrow at a lower 

rate?

 MR. TROWER: That is correct. It would be a 

nongovernmental entity that would be able to borrow at a 

tax exempt rate.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So don't you have to 

take -- therefore, if you're going to answer Justice 

Alito as you did, don't you have to take the position 

that Carbone really is not good law and the

Carbone/United Haulers distinction is not a -- is simply 

not a relevant distinction?

 As a dissenter in Carbone, I naturally do 

not find that the worst answer you could give.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But don't you have to give 

that answer?

 MR. TROWER: I thought the distinction that 

you drew in your dissenting opinion in Carbone between 

the one entity that has got to get the job done within 

the jurisdiction is the key distinction in observing 

United Haulers.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, as a dissenter in 

United Haulers, I also don't think it's a good 

distinction.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE ALITO: But couldn't there be 

instances where some, an industrial, a company is trying 

to -- is deciding to locate a plant and is choosing 

between Kentucky and Ohio, and Kentucky says, come to 

Kentucky because we'll issue private activity bonds so 

that you can finance this more cheaply than if you went 

into Ohio? And when you do that, aren't you, aren't you 

doing exactly what the dormant Commerce Clause is 

supposed to prevent?

MR. TROWER: No. You're doing -- the 

dormant Commerce Clause in no way restricts the ability 

of States to provide economic incentives for in-State 

business activity.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Trower, were private 

activity bonds considered at all below? As far as I 

understand, this is not a private activity bond, it's 

not, what's at issue here. And there was no 

adjudication with respect to that type of bond --

MR. TROWER: That's exactly --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- in the lower courts.

 MR. TROWER: That is exactly right, ma'am. 

And our position is that Respondents have no standing to 

make a claim focused solely on private activity bonds, 

because there is no evidence in the record as to whether 

Respondents own any private activity bonds.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose that you -- and I 

have the same hypothetical for both you and your 

brothers on the other side with some adjustment here, 

because I'm finding the case quite difficult. And the, 

the -- for you, imagine we have some milk producers in 

Kentucky. They are farmers. And they go to the 

legislature and they say, you know, we can sell a lot 

more milk in Kentucky if you will pass a law imposing a 

tax on Missouri farmers who want to ship milk into

Kentucky. That's the classic unlawful -- all right. 

It's unlawful, unconstitutional, right.

 MR. TROWER: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, what is 

the difference if a city in Kentucky that wants to 

finance its schools says now to the legislature, we're 

going to find it easier to sell bonds in Kentucky or 

elsewhere, in Kentucky, for our school system if you'll 

only put a tax on similar bonds that Missouri is 

offering to finance their city schools? That will help, 

just like the milk. Now, what's the difference?

 MR. TROWER: The difference is, is twofold. 

One, the favoritism in the first example, the dairy 

cases, which have come up a million times, is a 

favoritism of a private industry, whereas in your second 

hypothetical the favoritism is to the most public of 

industries, education.

 The second difference is that a tax on 

out-of-State dairy products increases the cost of 

out-of-State dairy products to in-State consumers with 

no detriment to in-State dairy producers, whereas, as 

our Respondents have pointed out in their brief, when a 

tax is imposed by a government on a transaction where 

the government itself is paying the money, which is what 

we have here, a tax on interest income paid by the

government, the effect is to impose a dollar-for-dollar 

reduction in the government's tax revenues equal to the 

amount of the exemption. So you've got an in-State 

entity, namely, the government itself, that is suffering 

a revenue loss.

 That's not at all comparable to the dairy 

hypothetical.

 JUSTICE BREYER: We have consumers in the 

dairy products that are suffering loss. They're all the 

voters in the States. Everyone drinks milk.

 MR. TROWER: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So they are suffering a 

dollar-for-dollar loss, because their milk becomes more 

expensive.

 I don't know if that's analogous. I think 

it's a pretty strong analogy. As to the first, that's 

of course the point that's worrying me. It is true that 

this is a public matter.

 MR. TROWER: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Would it make a difference 

in the first case if it happened to be some dairy 

farmers who -- there are so few in Massachusetts now, 

unfortunately, that they all work on State-owned dairy 

farms that are put up for, you know -- does it make a 

difference?

MR. TROWER: I think it would make a 

difference.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It would make a difference?

 MR. TROWER: If a hamburger stand is owned 

by the State, it's okay under United Haulers. If the 

State wants to go into the dairy business, the Commerce 

Clause doesn't prevent the state from doing that. 

That's our answer, is that the Commerce Clause does not 

extend to activities by a State on behalf of all of its 

people.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have a different 

variation here that wasn't present in United Haulers, 

which, of course, is that Kentucky does compete with 

other public entities in the municipal bond market. In 

other words, I think you have a strong case with respect 

to discrimination against private bonds, but Kentucky 

competes against Ohio bonds as well. And they're making 

the Kentucky bonds more attractive through this 

discriminatory tax on the Ohio bonds.

 Why isn't that a sufficient distinction from 

United Haulers?

 MR. TROWER: The key distinction in the 

United Haulers, Mr. Chief Justice, was between an entity 

with the responsibility for the welfare of the citizens 

within the jurisdiction versus all other entities. It

just happened to be in United Haulers that that was a 

public entity versus private entities. But United 

Haulers, we submit, would have reached exactly the same 

result if the trash haulers had wanted to take the 

garbage to a municipal or a public facility in New 

Jersey, as opposed to a private facility in New Jersey.

 And the second answer to your question is 

that other public entities, other States, other 

municipalities have no responsibilities in Kentucky for 

the public welfare. They're no different than private 

borrowers in Kentucky. They don't have sovereign 

immunity in Kentucky if they default on their bonds. 

They can be sued in Kentucky court. That's the 

essential difference.

 The question I think that the Justice Breyer 

brought up would also lead me to talk about what are the 

purposes of the Commerce Clause writ large, or the 

dormant Commerce Clause not writ large, that have 

motivated this Court's jurisprudence? I think there are 

three: Economic protectionism, which the Court has 

repeatedly said does not apply to activity by the State 

on its open behalf; secondly, the free market or free 

trade rationale, which has motivated many of the Court's 

decisions, but at the same time the Court has always 

been careful to say that the free trade rationale, Maine

v. Taylor for example, does not value free trade above 

all other values that we have. And we would submit that 

the value here is the fundamental sovereignty of the 

States.

 Our political system subdivides 

responsibility for government and responsibility for 

public works in America. Bonds are not issued by the 

States to make a profit or to leverage their return on 

equity. Bonds aren't issued to create an investment 

opportunity for Wall Street or for Main Street. Bonds 

are issued to finance the essential work of government. 

And this Court's decision should look at that part of 

the equation as much more significant and weigh those 

values much more heavily than the values of the free 

market, which don't really apply to the State's 

provision of goods and services. In all the dairy cases 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose a State said that 

it was unlawful for anyone other than a State resident 

to purchase the bond?

 MR. TROWER: That would be completely 

constitutional.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What if -- what if the 

State offered its taxpayers a higher interest rate than 

purchasers from other States? Would that be

permissible?

 MR. TROWER: Yes, sir, that would be totally 

permissible and would achieve the same result as the 

exemption that we've got here. So what you've got 

before you is --

JUSTICE ALITO: How would that achieve the 

same result if these bonds weren't negotiable and they'd 

be hard to sell, hard for you to sell, if people who 

bought them couldn't sell them, and they could sell them 

to somebody out of State and get the higher interest 

rate?

 MR. TROWER: I thought the question was if 

the bonds increased the interest rate and limited the 

purchasers to Kentucky citizens.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And these would be bonds 

that Kentucky citizens could not sell to anyone else?

 MR. TROWER: They could sell them to anyone 

else.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Anyone who wasn't a Kentucky 

citizen?

 MR. TROWER: It would be -- let me back up. 

I think I got ahead of myself there.

 It would be entirely constitutional for a 

State to offer bonds for sale and limit the sale to 

Kentucky residents and limit the payment of interest to

Kentucky residents and have a mechanism to assure that 

that would be the case. For example, contract 

submissions by brokers. The SEC does that right now 

thousands of times each day with Rule 144 sales. The 

administrative mechanism would be there. Would it be 

constitutional? Yes, sir. Our point is we've got a 

giant market upon which the States depend for the 

financing of public goods and services.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would it be constitutional 

to say that the holder of the bond must always be a 

Kentucky resident or, if you sold the bond, it has to be 

to another Kentucky resident?

 MR. TROWER: Yes, it would be. We've got 

the same analogy in the securities law, where the 

intrastate exemption is conditioned upon the holder of 

the security being an in-State resident who must agree 

not to transfer the security out of State.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose you 

could achieve the same result simply by providing you're 

not going to pay interest to somebody who is not a 

Kentucky resident.

 MR. TROWER: Yes, sir, you could.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So if New York has a very 

strong financial community, it can really benefit its 

citizens by keeping the market in New York bonds for

itself, if it chooses?

 MR. TROWER: Yes, it could.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And your case for that is 

what, United Haulers?

 MR. TROWER: Yes, sir, as well as an 

attention -- as I was going to earlier, the larger 

principles that are behind the dormant Commerce Clause 

jurisprudence of the Court. The Court has -- we talked 

about economic protectionism. We talked about the free 

trade rationale. And then the third rationale which 

comes up often in the Court's opinions is political 

solidarity. That is to say that the Commerce Clause was 

not a grant of power to the national government to enact 

free trade laws, but rather it was a grant of power to 

the national government to prevent Union-dividing 

friction between the States.

 We don't have that friction here. All 49 

States support Kentucky's position. Where that 

political friction is not an issue, the need for 

judicial invalidation of the laws of 42 States is 

commensurately less.

 On the other hand, what are the things that 

we think that the Commerce Clause doesn't require --

doesn't require the States to do? It doesn't require 

the States to give up incentives to local business

JUSTICE STEVENS: How do you reconcile that 

with the Bacchus case?

 MR. TROWER: Well, Bacchus was a case which 

favored the in-State pineapple wine producers --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Correct.

 MR. TROWER: -- with a tax.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I've always thought it was 

incorrectly decided, to be honest with you, but it's 

there. It's been there a long time.

 MR. TROWER: That doesn't surprise me at 

all, Justice Stevens, because your concurring opinion in 

Alexandria Scrap said the same thing. We agree with 

that position.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we have to 

overrule Bacchus to agree with you?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. TROWER: No, sir. No, sir. The 

suggestion that we're making here today is that a tax 

exemption which applies directly and exclusively to the 

payment of money by a government to its direct trading 

partners is all you're dealing with here. That would 

not change the result in Bacchus, Boston Stock Exchange, 

or any of the other discriminatory tax cases because all

of those cases involved a -- a tax or an exemption.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does your argument 

depend upon the uses to which Kentucky is putting these 

proceeds?

 MR. TROWER: No, sir.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought it 

would because you're saying nobody else is responsible 

for public works in Kentucky and so on.

 MR. TROWER: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. 

I thought you meant it made a difference whether they 

spent them on an airport or --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. Just a public 

facility.

 MR. TROWER: Yes, sir. Governmental.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if Kentucky had 

a law that it could only -- no out-of-State car dealer 

could sell cars in Kentucky, that benefited Kentucky car 

dealers, and then it had a special tax on Kentucky car 

dealers to fund local hospitals, airports, roads, 

whatever -- that would be all right?

 MR. TROWER: I don't think that would be all 

right. I think that's the West Lynn Creamery case in 

reverse.

matter? So the use to which the proceeds are put

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This is a tax case and that makes a 

difference. It's not a case about a monopoly, and 

what's key about that is that Kentucky has not taken 

over the national municipal bond market. It hasn't 

taken over the market. It is trying to regulate the 

market with this facially discriminatory tax. It is 

facially discriminatory because on its face the statute 

says if you buy in Kentucky an in-State bond you have a 

tax exemption. If you're in Kentucky and you buy the 

out-of-State bond, we tax you. This is no different 

from the Bacchus case or the Fulton case or Boston Stock

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or United Haulers.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: It's very different, Your 

Honor. Oh, no, it's very different, Mr. Chief Justice, 

from United Haulers. There inherent in the power to 

take over -- the State took over the local trash 

handling market -- the power to create a monopoly is the 

power to exclude all competition.

 Here Kentucky does not have a monopoly. 

They merely issue the commodity. Then, once it is in 

private hands, an interest in being paid.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Then of course you win as 

soon as we say the commodity is the same as milk. 

Obviously to me you would, but that's the issue. And in 

United Haulers what the question was, I thought, is if 

it is a traditional governmental function, anyway --

say, like producing electricity, or cleaning the 

streets -- there they discriminate and say you have to 

buy in State -- well, it's different, and indeed it may 

be okay.

 So what you've just heard your brother --

brother argue is if this is a fortiori, because here 

it's not even making electricity; it's not even 

collecting trash; it is financing the most basically 

governmental of all governmental institutions --

libraries, schools, streets.

 Now, why isn't it a fortiori from United 

Haulers, given the nature of the task that they are 

raising the money to finance?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Three reasons, Justice 

Breyer. First, as this Court stated in Oregon Waste, 

the purpose of or justification for a law has no bearing 

on whether it is facially discriminatory. Secondly, as 

this Court held in Bacchus, as long as there is some 

competition between the locally produced exempt product 

and nonexempt products from outside the State, there is 

a discriminatory effect. Here if you look at what --

what are these bonds?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can a State --

JUSTICE BREYER: You're arguing -- but can a 

State do this? It produces a service or product; it 

sells the service or product to in-State people at a 

price 50 percent less than it sells to out-of-State 

people.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Certainly, Your Honor. Under 

the market participant doctrine, if -- if you want to 

sell cement and you own the State-owned cement plant, 

you can choose. You recall in South-Central --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, you're saying if 

the State owns cement, it can sell 50 percent less to

its in-State citizens than out-of-State?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: That's what this Court held 

in Reeves v. Stake.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Then could it do 

this? Could it say that if you buy cement from 

out of State, the answer is no, right?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Through a tax, no. And I 

think the Court's precedent in South-Central --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Suppose what 

they are selling is education? Can the University of 

California say that when you send your child to the 

University of California, you will get a thousand 

dollars back on your income tax. But if you send the 

child to an out-of-State school, you don't?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: There the State is supplying 

educational services to its citizens, and under the 

market participant doctrine that would be fine. I think 

this hypothetical --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well if that's fine, then 

what they say is we sell you participation in the 

financing of the project.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But that's not what the tax

you the participation. It's called a bond, and if in

fact you give the money to us, and you are in-State, you 

get a thousand dollars back. But if in fact, when you 

do the identical thing, and you buy a similar thing from 

out-of-State, you do not get the money back? How is 

that different from what you just said was okay in 

respect to the University of California?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer, that would be 

a subsidy, and this Court drew the very distinction in 

the New Energy case as the difference between subsidy 

and a tax. And that I think is absolutely critical; and 

I think here Justice Holmes' admonition that a page of 

history is worth a volume of logic makes sense. The 

rallying cry for the American Revolution was "no 

subsidies without representation," it was "no taxation 

without representation."

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm sorry, then I 

wasn't clear in the hypothetical. The hypothetical was 

that you get a thousand-dollar rebate on your income 

tax. So I was trying to make it exactly like this case. 

You pay a lower State tax.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But I think -- I think there 

you would look through the form to the substance, and 

the substance there is we will charge you X amount for 

tuition and we are giving you part of that back as a 

rebate. That is no different from a subsidy. Here is

completely different, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it any different 

from a tax credit?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well here, Your Honor, as the 

Court made plain -- made plain in the Camps case, Camps 

Newfound/Owatonna, a tax exemption is not the sort of 

direct State involvement in the market that falls within 

the market participation doctrine. There is a key 

difference between a tax and a subsidy.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But in that case, the only 

thing the State was doing was taxing. Here in Justice 

Breyer's hypothetical, in the case we've got, the State 

is also participating in a bond market.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor, not in -- the 

part that they are taxing is not their participation 

part. I think a hypothetical will crystalize this.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why do we draw that line? 

I mean, you -- a moment ago you were talking about the 

-- the realities of subsidy. Why don't we confront the 

realities of -- of the fact that the State's 

participation in the bond market and the -- and the tax 

exemption go together hand in hand? It's unrealistic to 

divide them.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because, Justice Souter, 

there is a fundamental difference between the two. A

tax tears down; a subsidy builds up. If you want to 

subsidize your local park --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So what? The economic 

reality is precisely the same.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But not constitutionally, 

Justice Souter, and here is why --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Not constitutionally, we 

have said, in cases in which the State is not acting 

purely as the regulator. Here the State is not acting 

purely as the regulator. The State has a dual capacity, 

and you say ignore one side of that capacity for the 

other; and my question is why?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because, Justice Souter, here 

what the State is taxing is the out-of-State commodity. 

It is taxing -- it is doing a downstream regulation. 

The State issues a commodity -- just like in 

South-Central; the State issued the timber; the State 

owned the timber, and then it imposed a downstream 

regulation on the purchase --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but it's not taxing an 

out-of-State commodity in the sense of a commodity which 

is manufactured or produced out-of-State.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But Your Honor, it's no 

different than the Boston Stock Exchange case, where we 

are talking about securities -- or in Fulton, Your Honor

 JUSTICE SOUTER: In which case the State was 

not a participant, but the State is here.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But the State is using its 

taxing power to regulate -- to regulate interstate 

commerce, whereas in United Haulers, Chief Justice 

Roberts, there was no tax. There was no discriminatory 

tax. And inherent in the power to create a monopoly is 

the inherent power to preclude competition. Here there 

is competition. There is economic gamesmanship, Justice 

Souter. They want to sell their bonds nationally but 

hoard their own investment dollars locally, which is 

precisely --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you want to 

suggest -- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No. Please.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you suggesting 

that the result in United Haulers would have been 

different if there were a competing trash processing 

facility out-of-State?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, Your Honor, because there 

again we have a monopoly. The State took over the 

entire market -- the trash disposal facility of 

recycling and everything else in the United Haulers 

case. Inherent in the power to create a monopoly is the

power to exclude competition. There is no 

discrimination by definition.

 Here they have not taken over the market. 

They are imposing a downstream regulation by taxing the 

out-of-State commodity, and the distinction is 

exactly --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they are not 

taxing the out-of-State commodity. Their tax is imposed 

simply on Kentucky taxpayers.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: I think, Chief Justice 

Roberts, the analysis that the Court made in the New 

Energy case is directly on point and addresses this. 

There the Court said the Commerce Clause does not 

prohibit all State action designed to give its residents 

an advantage in the marketplace, but only action of that 

description in connection with the State's regulation of 

interstate commerce. Direct subsidies of domestic 

industry does not ordinarily run afoul of that 

prohibition; discriminatory taxation does. Again --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And this situation is 

somewhere in between the two. Because although we do 

not have what in form is a subsidy, we have what in 

economic reality is a subsidy for the benefit of the 

State's own activity as a bond issuer.

 So the question again is, why do we accept

your characterization that this case should be treated 

exactly as if the State were acting merely in a 

regulatory capacity?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because Justice Souter, the 

entire purpose of the dormant Commerce Clause 

jurisprudence is to protect the integrity of the market. 

If Kentucky wants to have a subsidy and say we are going 

to subsidize our own residents, fine. That builds up 

something in Kentucky.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And the whole purpose of --

of the combined effect of market participant for the --

acting for the purpose of providing an essentially 

governmental service is to give the State a free hand. 

Why do we ignore that in your argument in favor simply 

of the regulatory side?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because, Justice Souter, what 

they are doing here is imposing a facially 

discriminatory tax. They have the burden of saying, 

under the Court's precedents, they have no other 

alternative.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the question is whether 

it will be treated as we treat a facially discriminatory 

tax when there is no market participation, there is no 

State participation for the purpose of providing a 

fundamental governmental service. If -- if in fact

there is a good reason to treat them differently, then 

we don't follow the -- the facial discrimination test.

 Let me -- let me ask a -- a question with 

that as the premise. Assuming -- and I obviously do 

assume -- that we have a choice of analysis here, one 

good reason to choose the analysis that your brother 

has -- that the State is forwarding is the fact that we 

have historically a bond market which has grown up since 

New York issued the first tax-exempt or -- a bond.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: In 1919, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And we have an enormous 

market, the effect of interrupting which we really, as a 

Court, cannot tell very much. And that seems to me a 

very good reason to give the nod to the -- to the market 

participant, the essential services side of what the 

State is doing, as opposed to the regulatory side, and 

simply confront the thing under Pike.

 Why isn't that a good reason?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Because, Justice Souter, this 

case represents a classic race to the bottom where the 

only reason why we have these discriminatory tax laws is 

because New York started it in 1919.

 It wanted to hoard its own local investment 

dollars and yet sell its bonds nationally.

 Every other State caught on, and that

creates a problem in the marketplace which the dormant 

commerce claim --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you have a perfectly 

good remedy in respect to that. If the States don't 

like this race to the bottom, they need only create a 

compact or go to Congress.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But a compact is precisely, 

Your Honor, what the dormant commerce clause was 

designed to prevent -- States coming together and trying 

to create regional compacts or trying to create favored 

trade deals among themselves.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You know, I was only -- I 

was only addressing your point that there was a 

practical problem. Insofar as there is a practical 

problem, it seems to me the States have a perfectly good 

remedy even if they lose this case.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Even if they lose this case 

JUSTICE BREYER: Or win the case, whatever.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But Justice Breyer, the whole 

point --

JUSTICE BREYER: However.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: I think -- I think that the 

Court's analysis in Quill is on point here. In the

this very clear rule that says States cannot engage in 

facially discriminatory taxation. They can't do it.

 And if, in fact, we are wrong -- if, in 

fact, the Court's precedent creates a problem, then it's 

something that Congress can easily fix. The States can 

go to Congress.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But our approach in 

the General Motors case was the exact opposite. There 

we couldn't figure out whether the market for natural 

gas was captive or not captive.

 It was a little of each, and we kind of said 

well, you know, if it's kind of a close question, leave 

it for Congress. Because, after all, the Commerce 

Clause talks about Congress' power. The dormant 

Commerce Clause is not mentioned.

 So this is an area where Congress can 

regulate if it wants to, and it has never shown the 

slightest interest in interfering with State tax 

exemptions for their own bonds.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But, Chief Justice Roberts, 

the same could have been said for the problem in 

Granholm, where 26 States had the same no direct 

shipment problem; or the same problem in Bacchus where 

36 States had the same discriminatory alcohol tax laws. 

Congress didn't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It strikes me as 

much more fundamental, whether or not a State can issue 

a tax exemption for its -- its bonds.  That seems more 

fundamental than the more specialized issues in those 

other cases.

 And I think we have said when you're dealing 

with a specialized issue that may not get the attention 

of Congress, we have a different approach.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But, Chief Justice Roberts, 

Congress is as unlikely to address this problem now that 

it's so pervasive as it was to address the problem in 

Granholm, or the problem in Bacchus, or any of those 

other cases, or the problem in Fulton. Congress has 

plenty of other things to do.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That argument cuts against 

you in context, I think. You're saying in every case of 

any kind of discrimination one could go to Congress. 

Absolutely right.

 And since that's true of every case, now we 

are back to the more basic question, leaving the 

practicalities that you were talking about out of it, of 

whether this case is more like the cows. Is it more 

like the garbage collection?

the garbage collection, even a stronger case for 

permission under the Commerce Clause?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Breyer, this case is 

like milk. That's what that --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's where I wanted you 

to begin.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: If you look at -- it is -- it 

is, Chief Justice Breyer. If you look at bonds, 

municipal bonds -- and we have some samples of an 

Alabama bond and a Kentucky bond in the supplemental 

appendix.

 These are standardized forms that are traded 

as commodities like any other securities. They have the 

same regulatory overlay, which is distinct from General 

Motors v. Tracy.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's not 

distinct from United Haulers. Garbage is garbage, too.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: That's true.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the fact that 

bonds are bonds doesn't seem to me to be very 

responsive.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But the point -- two points, 

Chief Justice Roberts -- one is that in United Haulers 

we did not have a tax on the out-of-State commodity 

coming in. Here we do.

The second thing -- and I think this is 

critical -- we have a monopoly.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You didn't have a tax on 

the out-of-State. You have an income tax charged to 

Kentucky residents on their income from that bond. It's 

quite different.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But, Justice Stevens, that 

points out how this is a downstream regulation. The 

State's participation ends when it is done issuing the 

bond. It goes to underwriters who then trade them in 

the privately-owned national bond market, no different 

than in South Central.

 The State of Alaska owned the timber. It 

sold the timber in the marketplace. Then it sought to 

impose this downstream regulation.

 It would be the same as if New York City 

said, we have a local water company, and we have a 

monopoly. And now we have someone who we are licensing, 

a private business, to bottle that water to sell. And 

we are slapping a tariff on Poland Springs from Maine, 

because we want to protect the local business.

 That's what's happening here. The State has 

already issued the commodity. It is now in the 

marketplace, and now they are basically prohibiting the 

sale of it, or they are restricting the sale, by a

discriminatory -- in essence, tariff.

 If you live in Kentucky, we want to 

discourage you from buying a Michigan bond. And they do 

it by saying we will tax the interest on the -- on the 

out-of-State bond, and not tax the interest on the 

in-State bond. They are giving themselves a leg up.

 And one of the pernicious aspects of this is 

that it has the effect of pooling capital within the 

national market. It has the effect of creating this 

discriminatory barrier.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The victims under your 

approach, as I understand it, are the 49 other States, 

and all of them seem to support your opponent in the 

briefs that were filed in this case.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: True, Justice Stevens, but 

they don't want to issue refunds. You can understand 

that. A short-term gain for a long-term solution that 

would make them all better off, that would end this race 

to the bottom.

 My clients, the Davises, are penalized 

because they are engaging in interstate commerce. They 

are penalized. Because they own out-of-State bonds, 

they pay a tax.

question, I think, relies on the discrimination against 

the out-of-State issuers.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your clients are not 

out-of-State issuers.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: That's true.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We don't have an 

overbreadth doctrine under the Commerce Clause. Why 

aren't their arguments limited to discrimination against 

them rather than discrimination against out-of-State 

issuers?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Well, for the same reason 

that it wouldn't be limited with the -- the taxpayer in 

Fulton or the in-State taxpayer in Bacchus, where they 

are basically arguing that this affects interstate 

commerce.

 And as illustrative of that, we are saying 

look, in Bacchus you had the local brandy, and the local 

pineapple wine got a tax rate.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your Kentucky 

taxpayers can argue about the discrimination against 

out-of-State bond issuers?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: They can argue about the 

discriminatory effects of this law on the marketplace as 

a whole, because they are participants in the market.

They are penalized for engaging in interstate commerce, 

the same way that all of the same arguments were 

presented in the Bacchus case with an in-State taxpayer, 

the Fulton case with an in-State taxpayer.

 And the Court has basically made that plain 

in the New Energy case. You don't have to demonstrate 

that there is some overwhelming, you know, sky is 

falling problem. Any discrimination with respect to 

interstate commerce, any discriminatory effect, 

basically --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we know that 

your clients will be better off regardless of how this 

case is resolved? One way to resolve it, of course, 

would be to take away the Kentucky tax exemption, which 

would hurt your clients.

 Another way to resolve it would be to extend 

the tax exemption to the Ohio bonds, which may hurt your 

clients if the Kentucky bonds aren't competitive, and 

the price of the Kentucky bonds goes down. They are 

going to lose either way.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: The remedy, Your Honor, would 

be for the State to decide whether it wants to make all 

municipal bonds tax-exempt or to make them all taxable.

 Now, in Kentucky there is a constitutional 

provision which says they cannot -- they basically

cannot have their own bonds other than tax-exempt.

 So unless they change their constitution, 

the result would be to make all the bond, municipal 

bonds, tax-exempt in Kentucky, which, of course, would 

benefit my clients, who hold out-of-State municipal 

bonds. But consider this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But whether or not 

it benefits them, it seems to me, depends on how 

competitive they are with other States' municipal bonds.

 In other words, their advantage now comes 

from the tax exemption for Kentucky bonds; and it's not 

clear, if that is eliminated across the board, that 

Kentucky bonds are going to be competitive with, you 

know, bonds of whatever other State. So the value of 

them may go down, and your clients may lose, whether you 

win or not.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But, Chief Justice Roberts, 

consider these two critical points:

 One cardinal principle of investment is 

diversification. These discriminatory tax laws 

basically compel people to hold only the bonds within 

their particular State. Prospectuses for these 

single-State bond funds say: Warning -- not diverse. 

The second thing is their higher cost.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean it -- it

provides an advantage depending on the level of the 

State income tax and, I suppose, the level of the 

exemption. It doesn't necessarily mean that that's the 

only bonds they are going to hold.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But that simply means that if 

the State has a very high income tax, say, in 

California, that's all the more reason, all the more 

penalty, for people who want to engage in interstate 

commerce and diversify their portfolios.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it's less of a 

problem if it's like Kentucky, which, I assume, has a 

lower income tax.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Kentucky has a lower income 

tax, but I think on the -- on the problem that was 

raised, what if we -- if we affirm in this case, what 

would the impact be?

 Well, the State of Kentucky has said, 

itself, that if it has to pay out refunds, we are 

talking about a $4 million per year refund obligation 

the State of Kentucky has said it will have to pay.

 The sky is not going to fall. What would 

happen is that bond prices might adjust, but we would 

have the free national market with interstate trade and 

municipal bonds unimpaired by these artificial 

constraints. These artificial discriminatory tax

regimes create artificial demand. They pull assets. 

They hoard assets, local investment dollars, within 

particular States. And you have a problem where, say, 

cash-scarce States like, for example, Tennessee have 

more of a restricted access to capital markets like New 

York. If you're an investor in New York and you have 

money to spend in municipal bonds, you're discouraged 

from buying Tennessee bonds; you're encouraged from 

buying New York State municipal bonds. The relatively 

capital-scarce States are harmed. Again, people like 

the Davises, they are harmed, they are penalized from 

engaging in interstate commerce.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I can ask your brother who 

represents Petitioner -- maybe I'd better should -- I'd 

get a better answer from him so far as his position.

 As you understand his position, as you 

understand the State's position, would it be permissible 

for State A to go to State B and say: We -- if you make 

your bonds nontaxable to our residents, we'll make your 

bonds nontaxable to your residents.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: We actually have that, 

Justice Kennedy. Ohio, when it enacted its 

discriminatory tax scheme here similar to Kentucky's, it 

basically said: We will tax the bonds of an 

out-of-State State, unless they do not tax Utah bonds.

So -- but you can see that clearly illustrates, to me --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you find that 

consistent with the vision of the framers for our 

national market under the Commerce Clause?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Inconsistent, Justice 

Kennedy. Inconsistent. This is nothing more than an 

ongoing low-level trade war. It was started by New York 

in 1919, when it basically created this discriminatory 

tax scheme for itself. It basically incentivizes all 

the States to follow suit. And it's easy to understand 

why.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the example 

that was given of a interstate compact, say, to operate 

a port authority that covers a few States, and the 

compacters agree that they are not going to tax the 

income on bonds issued by the port authority, but they 

are going to tax the income from out-of-State municipal, 

but it's only the bonds from this port authority. So 

they -- it seems your theory would reach that too.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: It would, Justice Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And yet Congress has 

approved compacts that say just that.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But where Congress 

specifically speaks to permitting a particular practice, 

then it can't violate the dormant Commerce Clause. Here

Congress has not spoken. The States are doing this on 

their own.

 And, Justice Kennedy, again, it is 

completely inconsistent with the vision of the framers 

because what's happening here, again, is the race to the 

bottom, where New York said: All right, we're going to 

sell our bonds nationally; ah, we're going to create an 

investment for all the capital in New York to stay in 

New York.

 And you can see why every other State 

afterwards said: Oh, look what New York is doing. We 

have to follow suit to try to equal the playing field. 

And, again, that is at the heart of the ongoing 

low-level trade war with the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it assumes 

it's all in the definition of your market. If your 

market is tax-exempt bonds nationwide, it's one thing; 

but your brother says the market ought to be people who 

issue bonds for public works in Kentucky, and Kentucky 

is the only one who does that so there is no 

discrimination against anyone else because nobody else 

is similarly situated to Kentucky with respect to 

Kentucky public works.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But, Chief Justice Roberts, 

here it's easy to tell what the market is. Kentucky

municipal bonds, in spite of the tax discrimination, 

sell in a national, single market. There is a national 

Federal overlay. Under Federal income tax purposes, 

they're all tax exempt. They're all regulated under the 

same Federal securities laws. The fraud parts of the 

securities laws apply. They all compete for each other. 

It's the fact that they compete for each other.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any evidence in 

the record as to how much -- what percentage of the 

Kentucky bonds are bought by Kentucky residents?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: There is no good data on that 

information, Justice Stevens. We do not have an answer 

to that. But I think the point --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Does it -- do we have it 

for any State?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: No, we do not, Justice 

Stevens. We do not.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought it 

was inherent in your argument that most of them -- I 

mean, if you're talking about hoarding capital, it 

doesn't work very well if a lot of people outside 

Kentucky are buying these bonds. There's not much 

Balkanization if they're circulated widely. I thought 

that your argument depended on the proposition that most 

of these bonds are bought by Kentucky residents.

MR. BRUNSTAD: There is Balkanization, but 

it's not complete Balkanization, just like the tax in --

that Hawaii imposed on the alcohol didn't prevent the 

sale of fine California chardonnay imported into Hawaii; 

it just promoted the sale of the locally produced wine. 

It doesn't have to be a complete ban, as this Court 

explained in Limbach, a complete ban or a discrimination 

that imposes a burden. There's no constitutional 

difference.

 And that applies here too, but the market 

criteria the Court applied in GMC versus Tracy, I think, 

applies here. You don't look to define the market by, 

gee, what's going to happen or what's the purpose of the 

particular discrimination? You look at ordinary 

commercial factors. And here the ordinary commercial 

factors are there is one national market in which these 

standardized commodities trade. They're issued by the 

State. They're owned by individuals. Kentucky doesn't 

own the bonds. Kentucky issues them. They are then 

traded in the national market.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- not really standardize. 

Even without a tax exemption, residents of Kentucky 

would be interested in public improvements in Kentucky 

and have -- give a slight edge in the market to all 

Kentucky bonds. I think there would be just a natural

preference for locally issued bonds.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: And if they choose to do 

that, that's fine.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And not totally fungible.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: And of course that would not 

be prevented by having nondiscriminatory taxes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but it's a fact of the 

market, it seems to me, that Kentucky bonds are 

characteristically more attractive to Kentucky citizens 

than they are to out-of-State citizens.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But, Justice Stevens, I think 

that's an idiosyncratic value, not shared. Most 

investors care about yield and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I assume there would be a 

preference to Massachusetts milk for Massachusetts 

buyers, to Michigan automobiles for Michigan buyers, and 

the State did not subsidize.

strikes me as the argument that Japan made --

MR. BRUNSTAD: Justice Kennedy, that strikes 

me as the argument that Japan made when it said: We

justifications to say --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not 

fair because Kentucky is going to use the proceeds of 

the bonds to build a hospital, a school that is going to 

serve Kentucky residents.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there's -- it's 

not just emotional attachment to Kentucky that would 

promote the purchase of those bonds by Kentucky 

residents. It's self-interest. They want a public 

hospital nearby, and, therefore, it makes sense to buy 

the hospital bonds.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But, Chief Justice Roberts, 

every tax serves a public purpose. Every tax is for the 

State's purposes. If this Court opens the door in this 

case to say that this facially discriminatory tax regime 

is okay, this Court will open the door to all of the 

discriminatory taxes the Court has heretofore struck 

down. This case -- this Court's discriminatory tax 

precedents --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's a very --

there's a very big difference between -- and it gets to 

the difference with the Wisconsin cows, which was 

addressed in United Haulers. That's a tax on private 

activity, and private actors don't have the

responsibility of providing government services. 

Kentucky does.

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But every State does that. 

And I think we need to maintain three clear 

distinctions: Taxes, monopolies, and subsidies. They 

are constitutionally distinct. Why? If you look at the 

Constitution, you see all kinds of restrictions on 

discriminatory taxes. There is no --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't see a 

dormant Commerce Clause, though.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. BRUNSTAD: But the -- this Court's 

dormant Commerce Clause precedents are directed to 

preserving the integrity of markets. Once you stray and 

you do not have those clear lines between monopolies, 

United Haulers, discriminatory taxes, and subsidies, 

then I think you make -- you take what is a very clear 

monument of economic freedom, this idea of no 

discriminatory taxes certainly not discriminatory taxes 

on their face, and you blur those distinctions and you 

pull down this monument the Court has.

 As the Court -- for the reasons the Court 

said in Quill, these distinctions are important. If 

Congress, in this particular area, does not like the 

result, it can change the result. But,

jurisprudentially, we need to maintain a distinction 

between subsidies, between monopolies, and between 

taxes. Again --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Court, in that old 

Bonaparte case, it was just kind of very naive because 

the Court made a decision that didn't -- that State A 

can't create bonds that are going to be exempt from tax 

in other States, right?

 MR. BRUNSTAD: Not quite, Justice Ginsburg. 

That was a full-faith-and-credit case in which the 

Maryland resident said: Oh, I own out-of-State bonds; 

therefore Maryland can't tax me because the out-of-State 

State wouldn't tax me if I lived there. A completely 

different issue, Your Honor. This issue was not before 

the Court in Bonaparte.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF C. CHRISTOPHER TROWER

the Kentucky tax penalizes Respondents for participating 

in interstate commerce. The answer there is no. The 

Kentucky tax affords a direct trading partner, that is

to say a person that owns Kentucky bonds, a quid pro 

quo. If a Kentucky taxpayer loans money to Kentucky, 

Kentucky gives a tax exemption to that person that loans 

money to Kentucky. If a Kentucky resident chooses to 

loan money to California by buying California bonds, no 

tax exemption is afforded.

 But that different treatment is not a 

penalty, we would submit, but rather a recognition that 

the Kentucky resident who loans money to Kentucky is 

entitled to receive something in return.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why do you 

care, Mr. Trower? I mean, if you lose your tax 

exemption, it means you've got to pay more interest to 

sell your bonds, but it also means you're going to get 

taxes that you don't get now. Isn't it kind of a wash? 

Does it really matter.

 MR. TROWER: It matters tremendously, Your 

Honor. Seventy-five percent of all municipal bonds 

issued in America are issued by municipalities, local 

agencies, and those bonds -- under $10 million in 

principal amount -- those bonds account for only 7 

percent of the total volume of bonds outstanding. We 

pointed this -- citations for this are in our reply 

brief.

municipalities might have no market access at all for 

their bonds. An investor could ignore 75 percent of all 

bonds that are issued.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but the State's 

going to have more money from their income taxes, and if 

they want to spend it on a project in a particular 

municipality, they will be free to do that.

 MR. TROWER: They would be and that's 

correct, Mr. Chief Justice. But that choice is a choice 

that the Commerce Clause lets the States make, the 

choice to either raise taxes or to have a tax exemption.

 JUSTICE ALITO: It seems to me you're making 

a lot of arguments that, if accepted, would -- maybe 

this isn't true of all of your arguments, but certainly 

many of them would demonstrate that the Commerce Clause 

jurisprudence is utterly incoherent. If taxation is the 

same thing as a subsidy, if congressional inaction is 

the same thing as approval, if Kentucky bonds are not 

really in the same market as out-of-State bonds, what 

would be left of Commerce, of dormant Commerce Clause 

jurisprudence if those arguments were accepted?

 MR. TROWER: Well, all of the cases in which 

the tax exemption or -- or other restrictive law favored 

in-State private business would be left untouched. What 

we're arguing for here is a rule that would apply only

to a transaction between the State itself and the 

bondholder.

 Market participation, contrary to my 

brother's suggestion, does not end when the bonds are 

issued any more than when you borrow money your 

participation with your lender ends once the loan is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that's true. 

There's a national securities market. Everybody knows 

that.

 MR. TROWER: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I don't think either 

side can avoid that fact. He's suggesting that it cuts 

more in his favor than it does for yours because you are 

creating artificial barriers to that market. So that 

when a person who knows about Kentucky bonds and who 

knows what the good ones are moves out of state, he all 

of a sudden loses the advantage to purchase those bonds 

anymore, or at least he does -- he takes a penalty for 

doing that.

 Let me -- let me ask you this, the question 

I asked your co-counsel. A and D get together and agree 

on reciprocal advantages for their -- for their 

respective residents. Is that constitutional?

 MR. TROWER: If it's approved by Congress, 

yes, sir.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And isn't that exactly

happening here? You have, in effect, a pact among 

States to favor their own residents.

 MR. TROWER: You could make that argument, 

Justice Kennedy. But the -- the idea that what has 

happened here is a race to the bottom is post hoc 

reasoning extraordinaire. The Kentucky constitution was 

enacted in 1890, 40 years before Kentucky had ever 

enacted an income tax. The California constitution, 

which also requires California to exempt its own bonds, 

was enacted decades before California enacted an income 

tax.

 We would suggest that the record of history 

is the States saw the opportunity to give their own 

residents tax exemption as a way of finding a natural 

market for their bonds, and they chose to do that and 

that the fact that they chose to do that makes sense for 

the States that did it. It also made sense for those 

states that didn't choose to do that.

 I would note that the seven states that --

the State residents like it. That's the whole point. 

That's why the Commerce Clause exists as a check.

 MR. TROWER: Well, it's -- I wouldn't accept 

that as the reason that the Commerce Clause exists as a 

check.

 But let's examine that analysis. Where is 

the political check here? Well, we know how the other 

States would vote because they support Kentucky. SIFMA, 

which represents 90 percent of the bond trading --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: All politics is local. 

All States want to protect their residents and make it 

look like they're doing something for their residents. 

And that's exactly the purpose of Commerce Clause 

prohibition against explicit discrimination, which is 

what this is. There's no doubt that this is explicit 

discrimination.

 MR. TROWER: There's no doubt that the law 

on its face differentially treats two different kinds of 

bonds or different bonds issued by different States. 

We're not contending that at all. The question is, is 

whether that different treatment is permissible? The 

suggestion that the commerce --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Since we are talking here 

about the negative Commerce Clause, we really should say 

that's the reason the Commerce Clause doesn't exist.

(Laughter.)

 MR. TROWER: That's right. That's exactly 

right. And if we were -- if we were reading the -- the 

negative Commerce Clause, I would call your attention to 

the decisions in Reeves, which is exactly equivalent to 

a home embargo, because it kept all the cement in South 

Dakota; to the decisions in White and Alexandria Scrap, 

which were exactly equivalent to a border blockade, 

because they kept all the out-of-State workers from 

working in Boston or at least up to the extent of 50 

percent of the work forces; and under Alexandria Scrap 

the effect of the legislation was to keep all of the 

out-of-state towing companies from collecting the 

bounties. And then in United Haulers, yes, it wasn't a 

tax case, but that's a distinction without a difference, 

because what United Haulers was equivalent to was a home 

embargo.

 And it's the home embargo, the border 

blockade, and the discriminatory tariff or tax that are 

always held up as the prototypes of things that our free 

market prevents, as is the monopoly, which my brother 

says is okay if a State monopolizes all the trade, but 

it's not okay if a State still competes in the national 

market in the issuance of bonds but yet offers a direct 

financial incentive to its own taxpayers.

We come back to the effect of a tax 

exemption of this type. It is exactly equivalent to the 

payment of money by the State, because every dollar of 

that tax exemption represents a detriment to the State. 

The State is giving up revenue.

 Now, you're right, Mr. Chief Justice, it may 

be a wash at the end of the day, but that's a decision 

that the Commerce Clause leaves to the States to make. 

And your reference earlier to General Motors v. Tracy is 

directly on point here, because there you had a 

well-established, long-established market that the Court 

was loath to jump in without any institutional 

competence or information to evaluate the effects, where 

Congress could take action if any was necessary.

 What do we know about the historical record 

here? We know Congress excruciatingly discussed, just 

analyzed State tax and their effects on interstate 

commerce and did nothing.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you want us to -- do you 

want us to hold that if Congress is, quote, unquote, 

aware of some sort of discrimination that the States are 

engaging in, that there is, therefore, no dormant 

Commerce Clause problem?

 MR. TROWER: No. That's not what we're 

arguing for. We're not saying that what happened here

is equal to the kind of express approval of 

discrimination, which the Court's precedents have 

required.

 What we're saying is where what we got is a 

Congress that has studied this problem and done nothing, 

with a Congress that has routinely approved interstate 

compacts between the States that provide for 

differential taxation of bonds, with a Congress that has 

provided exemption from all tax for territory bonds, 

Puerto Rico, Guam -- those are completely exempt per 

acts of Congress, but Congress didn't go any further 

than that, what is the conclusions for this Court to 

draw? Does this Court rush in where Congress has failed 

to tread? We think not.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference 

between that situation and the sort of flow control 

ordinance that was involved in Carbone? Wasn't Congress 

aware of those?

 MR. TROWER: Yes. In fact, Congress had 

authorized the kind of flow control ordinance that was 

set up in Carbone. But as the -- as the Court decided 

the Carbone case, the facility in Carbone, in the view 

of the majority, was not a publicly owned facility. It 

was a privately owned facility. If Carbone came up 

again today, maybe a different analysis. But the

distinction between Carbone and United Haulers was 

discussed at length in United Haulers, and the Court 

found that a distinction --

JUSTICE ALITO: No, but why wasn't there the 

same kind of congressional whatever it is, acquiescence, 

in Carbone that you're claiming there was here?

 MR. TROWER: I don't know that there wasn't 

that same kind of congressional acquiescence. The 

question is -- is what -- what is the Court to make of 

that congressional acquiescence or congressional failure 

to act? That's what we are arguing for here. We are 

not saying Congress has sanctioned differential 

taxation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: We are talking about not 

just a dormant Commerce Clause, but a dormant Congress.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What are -- what are 

examples -- what are examples of Federal statutes that 

have allowed explicit discrimination?

 MR. TROWER: Prudential versus Benjamin. I 

guess that's the insurance case, which of course we've 

got --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In the insurance industry?

 MR. TROWER: Yes, sir, and that's obviously 

huge as well. I think that's enough.
