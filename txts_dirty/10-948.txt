4 next in Case 10-948, CompuCredit Corporation v. 

Greenwood. 

6  Mr. McConnell. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  MR. McCONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

11  This Court has consistently rejected the 

12 argument that Federal statutes that both create a right 

13 to sue and also bar waiver of rights under the statute 

14 are sufficiently explicit to override the strong Federal 

policy in favor of arbitrability expressed in the 

16 Federal Arbitration Act. In two of those cases, Gilmer 

17 and Pyett, the Court construed a statute the relevant 

18 language of which is virtually indistinguishable from 

19 that and the Credit Repair Organizations Act that we 

have before us today. 

21  Those cases involve the ADEA. Both the ADEA 

22 and CROA, as I'll call it, create a cause of action for 

23 aggrieved parties to bring actions for damages. And 

24 both statutes explicitly bar waiver of, quote, "any 

right" under the statute.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that statute 

2 didn't have, as this one has, a disclosure requirement 

3 that says you have a right to sue. 

4  MR. McCONNELL: And that's the sole 

distinction between the two statutes. So, let's talk 

6 about --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it could be a 

8 meaningful one. 

9  MR. McCONNELL: So, the -- first of all, the 

disclosure statute is a -- describes in layman's terms, 

11 gives a quick description of an operative civil 

12 liability section, which is set out in 1679g and which 

13 tells us exactly what Congress had in mind in creating a 

14 cause of action.

 And when you look at the language of the 

16 actual operative provision, 1679g, it's almost as if 

17 Congress deliberately went out of its way to use 

18 language that would not preclude arbitration. That 

19 language provides that a person who violates the statute 

shall be liable to the persons --

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose it said something 

22 different, Mr. McConnell. Suppose the disclosure 

23 provision didn't exist at all, but that instead of that 

24 liability provision, you had a provision that simply 

said: Any person injured by a violation of this Act

1 will have a right of action or will have a right to sue 

2 under this statute. And then you had the waiver 

3 provision that you have in this statute. Is that 

4 enough?

 MR. McCONNELL: Justice Kagan, I think that 

6 would be exactly the same, because a cause of action and 

7 a right to sue are the same thing.  They mean the same 

8 thing. And this Court has consistently since Mitsubishi 

9 held that just because Congress creates a cause of 

action which is a right to sue does not preclude 

11 arbitration, because --

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McConnell, you 

13 started with the notion that the disclosure provision in 

14 the statute is meant to apply to ordinary people, and if 

an ordinary person not schooled in the law read "you 

16 have a right to sue," wouldn't they understand that to 

17 mean I have a right to sue in court? 

18  MR. McCONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, in the 

19 ADEA context, the government itself, the EEOC, sends 

discriminated-against workers a right-to-sue letter that 

21 tells them they have a right to sue. But this Court has 

22 twice said that that does not preclude arbitration. And 

23 that's because a right to sue is simply a cause of 

24 action. It doesn't actually -- that doesn't mean 

exclusively a right to be in court. It gives you rights

1 which may be vindicated, and there are various ways in 

2 which they can be vindicated. And the Federal 

3 Arbitration Act provides that the -- that this Court or 

4 that the courts must enforce private contractual 

agreements that provide for the vindication even of 

6 statutory rights through arbitration. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Can you imagine any 

8 statutory language that would eliminate the right, the 

9 ability of the parties to enter into an arbitration 

agreement other than language that expressly prohibits 

11 the waiver of the right to sue in court in favor of 

12 arbitration? 

13  MR. McCONNELL: Yes, Justice Alito, I can 

14 imagine it. Now, Congress has to date not used it. 

Congress knows perfectly well how to bar arbitration. 

16 They've done it in a number of statutes. In fact, in 

17 the very Congress that enacted CROA, there were three 

18 different statutes that were proposed that would have 

19 eliminated arbitration for particular statutory schemes. 

None of them were adopted. 

21  But Congress is perfectly aware of how to do 

22 this. I don't think they have to use the magic words 

23 "no arbitration," but -- but they certainly have to do 

24 something considerably more direct than this.

 Here they've created a statute that provides 

6

Official 

1 that there must be liability and creates a cause of 

2 action, and then they tell people in a separate 

3 disclosure provision -- by the way, added very late in 

4 the drafting process, right -- simply to tell people 

that they have what is colloquially known for laymen as 

6 a right to sue. 

7  Now, we lawyers call things causes of 

8 action. We call them things like the right to bring a 

9 civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction. 

That's lawyers' language. But when ordinary people talk 

11 about this, they think that's a right to sue. But a 

12 cause of action and a right to sue are exactly the same 

13 thing. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. McConnell, the cases 

that you cite in support of your position rest on a 

16 distinction between procedural rights and substantive 

17 rights, which you invoke here. But where does that 

18 distinction itself come from? Because it seems very 

19 atextual in nature, that distinction, which does appear 

in the cases. But when Congress talks about rights, why 

21 should we think of rights as limited to substantive 

22 rights rather than also procedural rights? 

23  MR. McCONNELL: First of all, only our 

24 waiver argument depends upon those particular cases; we 

have a second argument. But, nonetheless, I think this 

7

25

Official 

1 comes from the very long tradition, at least back to the 

2 1980s in Mitsubishi, of understanding that arbitration 

3 is a choice of a forum, but it must vindicate the 

4 substantive rights of the particular statute.

 So, this is the way courts have talked about 

6 the relationship between arbitration and the substantive 

7 statute. So, you look at the statute, and you see what 

8 are the prohibitions, what are the substantive rights 

9 and so forth, and the arbitrators enforce all of those, 

but that the term rights does not include -- it does not 

11 mean that there's an exclusively judicial forum, just 

12 that whoever is the decisionmaker is going to enforce 

13 exactly the same set of substantive rights which are in 

14 the statute.

 But, Justice Kagan, even if that were not 

16 persuasive, Congress is perfectly aware that that's the 

17 way that this Court had been interpreting the words, 

18 because Gilmer, which interprets the very words "any 

19 rights" in an anti-waiver provision as not including 

arbitration, happened just a few years, 5 years, before 

21 enactment of this statute. And we know Congress was 

22 aware of Gilmer, because in -- the very same Congress 

23 that passed CROA also considered a bill, considered and 

24 rejected, a bill that would have reversed the decision 

in Gilmer.

Official 

1  So, Gilmer and the very question of -- of 

2 arbitration was before this Congress, and they knew that 

3 the word "any rights" was interpreted by this Court the 

4 way that it was in Gilmer, and they used precisely the 

language that was interpreted that way in Gilmer. 

6  And so, at this point, there's a vocabulary. 

7 It's like there's a glossary. Congress is using it, and 

8 even if it may not be, you know, fully textual, as you 

9 say, that's -- that's the way Congress now addresses the 

matter. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the Act in 

12 Gilmer did not designate court action or right to sue as 

13 a right within the non-waivable provision. 

14  MR. McCONNELL: That's true, Justice 

Ginsburg, and the question is, does it matter? I would 

16 say anyone looking at the ADEA's language, which says 

17 that an aggrieved person may bring a civil action in 

18 court, anyone would say that that is a right to sue. It 

19 is surely a right.

 And, indeed, when this Court interpreted 

21 that statute in Pyett, this Court called it a right, a 

22 right, to a judicial forum. Three times in the opinion, 

23 the Court refers to that as a "right." And the fact 

24 that our statute here refers to a right to sue, rather 

than a right to bring a civil action, seems -- certainly

1 against the backdrop -- recall, please, that the 

2 question here is whether Congress has explicitly 

3 abrogated the -- specifically disavowed, specifically 

4 barred the use -- the arbitrability of the -- of the 

contracts, and that all doubts are supposed to be 

6 resolved in favor of arbitrability, and the -- the 

7 statutes must be interpreted with a healthy regard for 

8 the policy in favor of arbitrability. 

9  Considering this, and considering the paltry 

basis in the text for -- for that conclusion, I don't 

11 see how the Ninth Circuit's decision can be withstood --

12 could be upheld. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think a --

14 the word "lawsuit" typically describes an arbitration 

proceeding? If you're subject to an arbitration, would 

16 you say, I'm in a lawsuit? 

17  MR. McCONNELL: I do not think so. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why doesn't a 

19 right to sue refer to a lawsuit?

 MR. McCONNELL: It refers to a cause of 

21 action, Your Honor, you know, and we can call that a 

22 lawsuit, too. I mean, often that's another layman's 

23 term for a cause of action. But this Court has held I 

24 don't know how many times, I believe it's at least six 

times since -- since Mitsubishi, that just because

Official 

1 Congress creates a cause of action and says that it will 

2 be in court, that does not mean that that's -- that that 

3 does not preclude arbitration, that that creates a cause 

4 of action.

 And I think the -- the underlying logic of 

6 this is that the existence of a cause of action or of a 

7 right to sue, which I submit is a synonym for a cause of 

8 action, is -- is not inconsistent with arbitration; it's 

9 the precondition for arbitration. If there were not a 

cause of action, there would be nothing to arbitrate, 

11 right? So, in every case in which there's a legal 

12 arbitration, there's a cause of action. It might arise 

13 from contract, it might arise from a statute, but in 

14 every single arbitration, there is a cause of action. 

If this Court were to interpret --

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, if this were written 

17 to be read by and understood by lawyers, I think you 

18 would have a stronger argument. But this is meant for 

19 consumers, and they read "you have a right to sue, and 

that right is not waivable." A right to sue -- they're 

21 not going to think about cause of action. They don't 

22 know what cause of action is. But they do know that a 

23 right to sue is a right to bring a lawsuit. 

24  MR. McCONNELL: Justice Ginsburg, again, if 

that is so, it would apply to other cases in which the 

11

25

Official 

1 language "right to sue" is used. For example, the 

2 EEOC's right-to-sue letters, what could be more explicit 

3 than that? But this Court has held several times that 

4 just because the EEOC sends a right-to-sue letter 

doesn't mean that Congress has --

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that in -- is that in 

7 the statute? Or is it just a colloquial --

8  MR. McCONNELL: It's in the regulations, 

9 Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but Title VII 

11 doesn't say "right to sue." It's a name that the agency 

12 uses, but it's not -- it's not in the statute. The 

13 statute doesn't say you have a right to sue. 

14  MR. McCONNELL: Well, what the statute says 

is you may bring a suit in court. And so, if this 

16 Court -- I do not see how the Court can say that the 

17 right -- that the language "the right to sue" is 

18 different from a right of action. It certainly -- it's 

19 -- it is the same thing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One way you could do 

21 it is that the right to sue is more familiar 

22 colloquially. If somebody, you know, hits your car and 

23 you jump out angrily and say -- you can say: I'm going 

24 to sue you. You're not likely to say: I'm going to 

bring a cause of action against you.

Official 

1  (Laughter.) 

2  MR. McCONNELL: We have -- there is no 

3 reason to think that when Congress appended a disclosure 

4 provision toward the end of the drafting of this statute 

and simply used a colloquial version of cause of action 

6 so that ordinary people would understand it, that they 

7 intended to change the meaning of the operative 

8 provision. The operative provision tells us, I think 

9 very clearly, what Congress meant, and then in this sort 

of quick shorthand, colloquial way, they're telling 

11 people, yes, they have an action, but just like they 

12 have an action -- persons have an action under the 

13 Sherman Act, they have an action under RICO, they have 

14 an action under the ADEA, they have an action under the 

Truth in Lending Act. In all of these cases, people 

16 have a right to sue, but this Court has held that 

17 arbitration vindicates the cause of action. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: In a standard arbitration 

19 agreement, if Smith and Jones agree to arbitrate and 

Jones then brings suit in court, and that action is then 

21 stayed pending arbitration, has there been a breach of 

22 the arbitration agreement simply by bringing the suit? 

23  MR. McCONNELL: I don't --

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, doesn't that 

happen rather often? 

13

Official 

1  MR. McCONNELL: It does happen rather often. 

2 I'm not sure what the -- I would say no. What I would 

3 say is that the -- is that the question of arbitrability 

4 has been put before the court, and the court will decide 

whether to enforce the arbitration clause or not. 

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And, of course, suits are 

7 brought after arbitration to enforce the arbitration 

8 award. 

9  MR. McCONNELL: Exactly. Exactly. So, in 

this sense, it's not that the cause of action goes away. 

11 It's not the -- the cause of action is not being waived. 

12 It's simply being vindicated in a different way, in a 

13 way which Congress in the Arbitration Act has told us is 

14 perfectly appropriate, just as appropriate as a -- as 

vindication in Court and that we should leave it to --

16 and that a contract between the parties to decide which 

17 of the forums for vindication of their rights would be 

18 used should be enforced. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Except that this is not 

what the parties decide. These are take it or leave it 

21 contracts. So, the consumer doesn't really elect 

22 arbitration. It's just presented as part of the terms 

23 that the consumer can take or leave and not negotiated. 

24  MR. McCONNELL: That is an argument against 

arbitration that this Court has rejected several times.

Official 

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's a question of 

2 whether we take that into account in -- in determining 

3 what "you have a right to sue" means. 

4  MR. McCONNELL: Well, Justice Ginsburg, 

Congress -- that's a policy question, and Congress has 

6 given us an answer. Recently, by the way, Congress has 

7 indicated a slightly different answer which will affect 

8 cases like this in the future. As part of the 

9 Dodd-Frank regulatory reform bill, Congress required the 

new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conduct a 

11 serious study of the use of arbitration procedures in 

12 consumer financial matters to find out whether things 

13 like what you referred to, Justice Ginsburg, the -- the 

14 types of contracts and so forth are fair to consumers.

 So, we'll get an authoritative answer to 

16 this. And Congress then vested this new bureau with 

17 authority either to outlaw arbitration awards or to 

18 require conditions or to reform them. But in the 

19 meantime, the policy that Congress has set is the policy 

in the Federal Arbitration Act, which is one of a strong 

21 policy in favor of enforcing arbitration contracts. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: You know, except if Congress 

23 indicates otherwise and --

24  MR. McCONNELL: Unless Congress has 

indicated otherwise. 

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

25

Official 

1  JUSTICE KAGAN: And I guess that the problem 

2 here is that there is this language in this disclosure 

3 provision which is meant, you know, truly to inform 

4 consumers about -- about their rights and about where 

they're going to end up resolving their disputes, and it 

6 says "you have a right to sue." And you're asking us 

7 essentially to read that language as: You have a right 

8 to bring a claim in court, but it's probably going to 

9 end up in arbitration because of the nature of your form 

contract. 

11  And that seems a very different kind of 

12 statement to consumers. 

13  MR. McCONNELL: Justice Kagan, I do not see 

14 how it would be any different from a consumer who reads 

any of the statutes that this Court has held are subject 

16 to arbitration. If, for example, in the Truth in 

17 Lending Act, which this Court interpreted in the Green 

18 Tree case that as part of the arbitration contract, it 

19 was required to send the consumer a copy of the statute. 

The consumer would read in the statute that there's a 

21 cause of action, that they can bring suit in court to 

22 enforce their rights under the Truth in Lending Act. 

23  They would read that statute, and they would 

24 draw exactly the same conclusion that they do from the 

shorthand layman's language of "a right to sue."

1  But, again, even if that were so, I think as 

2 a matter of -- of how -- of statutory interpretation, 

3 that a disclosure provision cannot change the meaning of 

4 the operative section. The operative section which 

creates the rights and liabilities here is section 

6 1679g. And not even Respondents seriously claim that 

7 that section is -- shows a congressional intent to 

8 prevent arbitrability. And that seems -- the fact that 

9 there's a disclosure provision that uses more informal 

language instead of the lawyers' language used in 1679g 

11 does not change the meaning of the statute. 

12  Unless there are further questions, I will 

13 reserve the remaining part of my time for rebuttal.

16  ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON 

17  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

18  MR. NELSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

19 please the Court:

 The Credit Repair Organizations Act provides 

21 consumers with what it explicitly denominates a right to 

22 sue, and then it says that any right of the consumer 

23 under the statute is non-waivable. As this Court has 

24 said --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that mean that

Official 

1 there's a violation of the statute the minute one of 

2 these organizations asks someone to sign an arbitration 

3 clause? 

4  MR. NELSON: There's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: A $1,000 penalty for the 

6 mere asking? 

7  MR. NELSON: There's a -- there's a 

8 technical violation in asking, because in 1679f not only 

9 are waivers made unenforceable, but it is -- it is 

prohibited to ask someone to waive their rights. 

11  However, that does not mean that you 

12 actually have a cause of action to go in and sue 

13 somebody for that, because, remember, under 1679g, what 

14 you can sue for is your money back. If somebody's asked 

you for a waiver -- you didn't sign the contract, you 

16 didn't pay them any money. Or your damages -- if 

17 somebody asked you for a waiver and you never signed up 

18 with them, you don't have any damages. And then 

19 punitive damages in addition, which -- you know, the 

general rule about punitive damages is you get them on 

21 top of actual damages if you have actual damages. 

22  So, it's -- yes, it's a technical violation. 

23 If a company engaged in a pattern or practice of it, the 

24 FTC could quite rightly go in and get an injunction 

against that. But it's not a case where there would be

1 some onerous penalty imposed on a company merely for 

2 asking for a waiver. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, doesn't that 

4 reading, however, make suspect your claim that Congress 

would have intended -- without any discussion in the 

6 legislative history -- and our case law has said you 

7 have to read the intent to bar arbitration both from the 

8 language of the statute, its context, and its history. 

9 I just don't see any history here that supports your 

reading. 

11  MR. NELSON: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I want 

12 to take that in two parts, because the first was -- was 

13 tied to the -- the attempt to procure a waiver and 

14 whether that calls into question whether Congress really 

could have meant this. It's sort of an unusual 

16 provision to say not only can you not waive rights, but 

17 it's a violation even to ask somebody to waive them. 

18  But that's no more unusual with respect to 

19 the right to sue than with respect to any other right 

under this statute. For example, the right to cancel 

21 after 3 days. Everybody would concede, I think, that 

22 that's a non-waivable right under the clear language of 

23 this statute. It's an unusual and perhaps onerous 

24 provision to say that if somebody just suggested that 

you waive that right to cancel and you never actually

1 waived it, they still violated the statute. 

2  But, you know, that's what Congress wrote 

3 here, because in this statute, it was concerned with an 

4 industry that it saw as overreaching pervasively in 

relation to the people that it was -- it was trying to 

6 sign up for its services. And that's why Congress 

7 wanted a very strong prohibition of waiver of rights 

8 that even attempted -- that even extended to attempts. 

9  Now, as to the --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Nelson, but your 

11 friend Mr. McConnell says quite rightly that the rules 

12 in this area have been fairly clear, that Congress knew 

13 it had to make especially clear that it wanted to void 

14 arbitration agreements. So, if that's the case, why 

didn't Congress do what it has done in a thousand other 

16 statutes -- or maybe that's an overstatement -- but a 

17 number of other statutes, which is to say so? 

18  MR. NELSON: First of all, the -- the rules 

19 are not that Congress has to be especially clear in this 

context. And, in fact, the Court has said over and over 

21 in the line of cases starting with Mitsubishi, McMahon, 

22 Rodriguez de Quijas, and Gilmer that what has to be 

23 discernible -- and this also gets back to Justice 

24 Sotomayor's question -- it merely has to be discernible 

from the text or the legislative history or the

1 structure and policies of the Act that -- that there's 

2 an intent to preclude waiver of the right to judicial 

3 remedies. 

4  That's not an unmistakable plain statement 

rule; it's not a requirement of explicitness in the 

6 sense of explicitly using the term "arbitration." As 

7 even my friend stated, there's no requirement of magic 

8 words. 

9  What this Court said, what it told Congress 

in the years leading up to this statute is: You have to 

11 express a discernible intent to preclude waiver of the 

12 right to judicial remedies. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. And -- and you 

14 don't need a magic word, but it seems to me you need 

something more than a provision dealing with what you 

16 have to tell to the people who -- who accept these 

17 contracts. I mean it's not in the substantive part of 

18 the statute. It's in the part of the statute that tells 

19 you what provisions of the -- of the Act you have to 

notify the consumer of. It's a very strange way for 

21 Congress to say "no arbitration" by putting this 

22 language in a section that has nothing to do with the 

23 rights under the Act.

1 summary of the rights under the Act. 

2  MR. NELSON: Justice Scalia, I think it's --

3 I think it's not a strange way at all but a very direct 

4 way in the context here. Remember, in Gilmer, what the 

Court was dealing with was a statute that as amended in 

6 an amendment that actually wasn't before the Court in 

7 Gilmer said you can't waive any right under the statute. 

8 But that then raises a question: Well, what do we mean 

9 by rights under this statute? And the Court concluded 

there and reinforced in Pyett that it interpreted that 

11 to mean substantive rights; in the absence of a textual 

12 indication, that when Congress used the term "rights" in 

13 this statute, it was intending to protect the procedural 

14 right to go to court.

 Here we have something very different. 

16 Congress creates a cause of action which, as my friend 

17 says, colloquially someone could call that a right if 

18 they wanted to. But the cause of action says you can --

19 you can obtain this liability; the court will determine 

it; you obtain it through an action. That certainly 

21 gives you an entitlement to go to court. But Congress 

22 then goes further and it denominates that one of the 

23 rights under this statute, one of only two rights under 

24 this statute that are so-called.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that Gilmer

1 would have come out differently with regard to one of 

2 the procedural rights involved in that case if the 

3 statute had happened to refer to that procedural right 

4 as a right? Procedural rights are rights, aren't they?

 MR. NELSON: Yes, they are definitely 

6 rights, and --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, and if the statute in 

8 Gilmer had referred to one of the procedural rights in 

9 passing as a right, you think that one would have been 

non-waivable? 

11  MR. NELSON: I think that if Congress had 

12 expressly denominated something in that statute as a 

13 right --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: But procedural rights are 

rights. I mean, to denominate it as a right is --

16  MR. NELSON: Well, but the question is: 

17 Does "any right" refer to both procedural and 

18 substantive rights? 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly.

 MR. NELSON: Which is what this Court held 

21 that it did not in Pyett. But when Congress -- you 

22 know, it does matter what words Congress uses, and 

23 "rights" is a word that can have a lot of meanings. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but --

MR. NELSON: This is a statute that --

Official 

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're saying -- in 

2 answer to my question, you're saying that just because 

3 the statute refers to procedural rights as rights, just 

4 as we do, all of a sudden, simply because the statute 

uses our normal language, those procedural rights are 

6 elevated to the level of substantive rights and can't be 

7 waived. That can't be right. 

8  MR. NELSON: I think if Congress makes clear 

9 in the statute that what it means when it's talking 

about rights is -- includes procedural rights, and then 

11 it has a provision that says any right under this 

12 statute is not subject to waiver, that creates a very 

13 strong inference that Congress meant what it said. But, 

14 in fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that 

16 referring to a procedural right as a right creates any 

17 inference at all. It is a right. 

18  MR. NELSON: It is a right, and when 

19 Congress has said -- I mean, many of these statutes such 

as Title VII and TILA don't say that rights are 

21 non-waivable. This statute is a unique statute in its 

22 phrasing. It has a non-waiver provision applicable to 

23 any right, and it has a list of rights. That's pretty 

24 unusual.

1 besides the 3 days to back out? 

2  MR. NELSON: Well, the other thing that this 

3 statute makes non-waivable besides rights is 

4 protections, and -- which is a phrase that isn't then 

tied to anything defined in the statute. But I think 

6 that, for example, all of the prohibited practices 

7 listed in section 1679b, which are at pages 4a to 5a of 

8 the red brief -- those would be non-waivable. You 

9 couldn't waive your right not to have the credit repair 

organization make false statements to you. You couldn't 

11 waive your right under 1679b(b) not to have to make a 

12 payment in advance to a credit repair organization. You 

13 can't waive the right to the disclosures provided for in 

14 1679c or the protection provided by those disclosures. 

And 1679d requires written contracts and specifies those 

16 terms. Those would all be subject to the provision in 

17 the statute that says you can't waive any protection or 

18 any right provided by the statute. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you know, Mr. Nelson, 

whether this statute is unique in this sense: Do you 

21 know of any other statute that arguably voids 

22 arbitration agreements without saying that they're 

23 voiding -- that it's voiding an arbitration agreement? 

24  MR. NELSON: No. There's a -- sort of a 

pending disagreement, perhaps, over whether the

Official 

1 Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act does, but that's because of 

2 some very specific language in that statute about 

3 informal dispute resolution mechanisms and the manner in 

4 which that has been interpreted in agency regulations. 

So, this is really the only statute that I'm aware of 

6 that uses this formulation. 

7  But you remind me of your earlier question, 

8 which I never got to finish answering about the 

9 thousands of other statutes that say specifically that 

you can't enforce arbitration agreements. In fact, 

11 there are very few such statutes. There were none at 

12 the time this statute was enacted. The first one 

13 appeared 6 years later. The only time that there has 

14 been any number of them is in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, 

which came after what I would say is a lengthy period of 

16 considerable attention that had been paid by advocates 

17 before Congress to the issue of arbitration that I think 

18 led to the desire to use as sort of a belt and 

19 suspenders approach in those statutes.

 But what we had here in 1996, there had 

21 never before been a statute that prohibited the 

22 enforcement specifically of an arbitration agreement in 

23 those terms. And as Mr. McConnell said, there were some 

24 proposals, unenacted proposals, that had been floated at 

that time. But I think the one thing that is clear is 

26

20

25

Official 

1 that we don't learn how Congress does things by looking 

2 at things that it didn't do. And that's all those 

3 unenacted proposals were. 

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would your position of 

right to a lawsuit -- would that extend to a 

6 post-dispute genuinely bargained-for right to arbitrate? 

7  MR. NELSON: No, I think not, Justice 

8 Ginsburg, and for this reason: The -- the Court has 

9 always differentiated between post-dispute settlements 

of claims and pre-dispute waivers, and has not 

11 considered agreements to settle, absent very special 

12 either statutory language such as in the ADEA, which 

13 does apply a waiver provision to some types of 

14 settlements, and in the Fair Labor Standards Act, where 

there's a very specific policy reason for prohibiting 

16 certain kinds of settlements. But, generally, the Court 

17 has not considered the settlement of a case to be a 

18 waiver of the right to bring the case. And that 

19 primarily came in the FELA cases that we cited in our 

briefs. 

21  But I think it was significant that in Wilko 

22 v. Swan, where the Court said we're going to interpret 

23 the Securities Act not to -- not to allow waivers of the 

24 right to sue, the Court said: Of course, this wouldn't 

apply to something that came post-dispute. 

27

Official 

1  And in McMahon and Rodriguez de Quijas, what 

2 the Court disagreed with Wilko v. Swan about was whether 

3 the right to sue under that particular statute was 

4 non-waivable. But it favorably commented on the notion 

that, of course, even if it were, it wouldn't bar a 

6 post-dispute agreement to arbitrate a claim as a way of 

7 settling an actually pending dispute. 

8  And that's why I think when Congress enacted 

9 this statute, it would have been acting against that 

backdrop and would not have -- no one would have thought 

11 that a settlement agreement is a waiver of the right to 

12 sue. A settlement agreement is a resolution of the 

13 right to sue. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Another argument that is 

made, in opposition to your position, is that the 

16 statute says any waiver of any protection or right may 

17 not be enforced by any court or any other person. And 

18 the suggestion is "any other person" must contemplate an 

19 alternate dispute method that doesn't involve court --

court or any other person. 

21  MR. NELSON: Well, I don't think that it 

22 necessarily contemplates an alternative dispute 

23 resolution mechanism, because I think, for example, that 

24 would bar -- when someone goes to court to compel 

arbitration, they are enforcing an arbitration agreement

1 by bringing an enforcement action. So, that would bar 

2 them from doing that. 

3  So, "any other person" doesn't necessarily 

4 mean arbitrators. But even to the extent that it 

comprehends arbitrators and maybe even one might have 

6 thought was principally applicable to them, you've got 

7 to realize that this statute -- what it prohibits is 

8 only the waiver of the consumer's ability to arbitrate 

9 her CROA claim. It doesn't bar a credit repair 

organization from requiring a consumer to arbitrate the 

11 credit repair organization's breach of contract action. 

12 And, in fact, most -- well over 99 percent of the 

13 consumer arbitrations that were handled by the 

14 arbitration forum that was designated in this contract 

were collection actions brought by a company that says 

16 this consumer owes me some money. 

17  So, that's kind of the norm. That's the 

18 general run of arbitration cases. And if a credit 

19 repair organization were to initiate an arbitration 

against a consumer, that wouldn't violate the non-waiver 

21 provision; but if the consumer then defended and said, 

22 wait a second, this contract is void because I never got 

23 the right to cancel, the provision would quite clearly 

24 prevent the arbitrator in that circumstance from saying 

you waived the right to cancel.

Official 

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the 

2 argument that the consumer retains the right to sue, 

3 since they can go into court with their complaint, but 

4 it's simply -- the rule that the court will apply is 

that you have to proceed to arbitration? 

6  MR. NELSON: Well, I think it's -- it would 

7 be a remarkably crabbed notion of having a right to sue 

8 that meant you could file a complaint that was 

9 mandatorily subject to decision elsewhere. And, second, 

and this goes to Justice --

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's 

12 frequently -- that's frequently the way these issues 

13 come up. I mean, people --

14  MR. NELSON: Well, that's certainly --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- who think they 

16 cannot be forced to arbitrate either under the agreement 

17 or any other provision, they'll bring their complaint in 

18 court, and then there will be a judicial resolution of 

19 whether or not the proceeding should go to arbitration.

 MR. NELSON: But -- but all that has been 

21 resolved in that -- that suit is not the plaintiff's 

22 claim under CROA, which is what he has a right to sue 

23 on. All that's resolved is the issue of whether he has 

24 a contractual obligation to arbitrate which he has 

breached by going into court.

Official 

1  And this goes to Justice Kennedy's question. 

2 Under the FAA, you can compel arbitration when someone 

3 has filed a complaint that is in breach of an agreement 

4 to arbitrate.

 So, they -- they don't actually have a right 

6 to sue. You can't stop them from going and filing a 

7 complaint, but once they do, you come in and say, no, 

8 you have no right to -- to proceed on the merits with 

9 this claim in court. And, in fact, that's -- that's 

exactly what the arbitration --

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you get -- can you get 

12 damages in the arbitration for the cost of attorney's 

13 fees to go to the court to say that you had to go to the 

14 arbitration?

 MR. NELSON: No, I don't think you would 

16 generally have that entitlement under any -- any rule of 

17 law that is -- that is normally applicable in American 

18 courts. However, if your -- if your arbitration 

19 agreement provided for that -- I'm afraid I can't point 

to any decision that would make it unenforceable, much 

21 as I would regret that result. 

22  So, you know, I think in a -- in a real 

23 sense, the consumer has no right to -- right to sue 

24 merely because they can run into court and -- and then 

be compelled to arbitrate. And that's exactly why this

25

Official 

1 Court, in every one of its decisions enforcing 

2 arbitration agreements or not, has referred to the 

3 arbitration agreement as a waiver of the right to 

4 proceed judicially. It has used that phrase over and 

over again in McMahon, Rodriguez de Quijas, Mitsubishi, 

6 and -- and Gilmer itself. 

7  The -- the common recognition of all those 

8 cases is that the arbitration agreement is a waiver of 

9 the person's right to proceed in court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree, I take 

11 it, that you would lose if the statute said "you have a 

12 cause of action"? 

13  MR. NELSON: Yes. I -- you know, a cause of 

14 action I don't think would -- would do it for us. In 

fact, that's exactly what the ADEA says, the section 

16 that creates a judicial remedy is headed "Cause of 

17 Action." And so, you know, the question again is 

18 "right" is a word that -- that can be used in many 

19 senses. It's -- it's a word sort of like 

"jurisdiction." It gets thrown around loosely. But 

21 when Congress says a right is non-waivable, it's 

22 referring to something specific. And the question is: 

23 What is it referring to in a statute that uses the term 

24 "right" and uses it to describe the -- the ability to go 

to court? 

32
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1  And -- and, again, that "right to sue" 

2 language is important in two ways, because it not only 

3 specifies that the 1679g remedies are a right for 

4 purposes of this statute, but it says something about 

the nature of the right. It's a right to sue. It's not 

6 just a right to get those damages, to get your money 

7 back. And "sue," as I -- and I think my friend 

8 agrees --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -- well, I guess it 

goes further than that, your argument does, it seems to 

11 me. Your argument is the waiver -- the non-waiver of 

12 rights provision would normally be read to mean 

13 non-waiver of substantive rights, but the notice given 

14 to the consumer here, which refers to the procedural 

right to sue as a "right," eliminates that presumption. 

16  So, I presume, therefore, that your position 

17 is that all procedural rights under this statute cannot 

18 be waived. Because, I mean, that's what we're talking 

19 about: What does "right" mean --

MR. NELSON: Justice --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- when it says rights are 

22 not waived? And our prior case law says ordinarily that 

23 means only substantive rights. But here in this 

24 statute, it refers to the right to sue, which is 

certainly a procedural right, as a right. So, I presume 

33

1 all the other procedural rights in this statute likewise 

2 cannot be waived. 

3  MR. NELSON: Well, I -- I'm not really sure 

4 there are other procedural rights in the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, there are none? 

6  MR. NELSON: I mean, unless -- the right to 

7 cancel within 3 days I suppose could be called a 

8 procedure in one sense, although it's -- it's -- I think 

9 it -- it probably would generally be categorized as a 

substantive right. 

11  But as far as procedural rights of the 

12 consumer, they are set forth in 1679g, and they are the 

13 right to bring an action either on an individual or 

14 class basis for the damages and attorney fees specified 

in that section. And that's what I think is being 

16 referred to as "the right to sue." 

17  Now, if there were something else in the 

18 statute that one might arguably call a right and 

19 arguably call procedural -- I mean, it's hypothetical 

because I don't think it's there, but I would not jump 

21 to the conclusion that it was a right if it was not 

22 comprehended by "right to sue," because I think what 

23 that statement "right to sue" makes non-waivable is the 

24 right to sue. It's not just any procedural thing in 

this statute that one might loosely call a right.

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the case were 

2 reversed. The liability section says you have a right

4 to sue or go to arbitration. What result then?

 MR. NELSON: Well --

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that under 

7 your -- well, I'll let you answer. 

8  MR. NELSON: Justice Kennedy, let me divide 

9 it up. If the liability section said you had a right to 

sue and there were no disclosure -- disclosure section 

11 at all, I would say that's -- that's plenty good enough. 

12 If the disclosure section says, you have a right to sue 

13 or to go to arbitration, I think you would have to then 

14 say sensibly what is Congress talking about when it's --

when it's referring to this, and you would have to read 

16 them together. And I would have a hard time standing up 

17 here and saying that a statute that told people "right 

18 to sue or arbitrate" meant right to sue only and 

19 foreclosed arbitration. And -- and, you know, I think 

-- I think that really would be a very different matter. 

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Nelson, you just said if 

22 the liability section said you have a right to sue, 

23 that's okay, but if it says you have a cause of action, 

24 that's not okay. But the right to sue is really just a 

colloquial way of expressing the first. So, why should

1 we draw the line between those two things? 

2  MR. NELSON: Well, when you say 

3 "colloquial," I'm not -- I don't want to fence with you, 

4 but I think that that's selling it a bit short. This is 

a statute where Congress prescribed a notice, prescribed 

6 it in statutory terms, did it so people would have an 

7 understanding of what their rights were, and did it in a 

8 way that no reasonable consumer would understand meant, 

9 oh, this non-waivable right is not really to sue in the 

way that I would ordinarily understand the word, and 

11 even that courts normally use it but actually to -- to 

12 do something else. 

13  So, I -- I don't think it's colloquial in --

14 in a disparaging sense. What it is, is something that 

is designed to convey a clear meaning, and the clear 

16 meaning that it conveys is you have a right to go to 

17 court. Now, of course, even a disclosure that you have 

18 a right to go to court wouldn't be enough to get you 

19 over the hump if you didn't also have a provision that 

made that right non-waivable. But, again, here what you 

21 have is both. 

22  And -- and in doing that, in writing that 

23 statute, Congress was doing exactly what the Court had 

24 told it, it didn't do in Gilmer, it didn't do in 

McMahon, it didn't do in Mitsubishi. It created a right

7  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. McConnell, can we go 

to the issue of the class action? If we buy your 

11 argument that procedural and substantive rights are 

12 different, is it your position that you could seek a 

13 waiver of a class action even though this statute 

14 expressly contemplates class actions?

 MR. McCONNELL: Actually, Justice Sotomayor, 

16 I think this statute specifically does not require -- it 

17 contemplates but does not require class actions. If you 

18 look at -- at 1679g(a)(2)(B), which is the class action 

19 provision -- it's on page 59a of the appendix to the --

to the petition -- all that it says is that in the case 

21 of a class action, here is how we would -- here's how 

22 the damages, the punitive damages, would be calculated. 

23 It does not say that there must be class actions. It 

24 doesn't make that a non-waivable right at all.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you have to meet 

6 the prerequisites --

7  MR. McCONNELL: Whether waivable or not. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you have to meet the 

9 prerequisites of a class action before you are entitled 

to seek one. But your position is that's not a 

11 protected right? 

12  MR. McCONNELL: May I -- if we were to 

13 hypothesize that the statute did provide that there 

14 shall be class provisions, which this does not -- I 

think this statute is agnostic on that, but the 

16 hypothetical statute where class actions are 

17 contemplated, I would not argue that that is necessarily 

18 waivable. What I would argue is that that can be 

19 vindicated through arbitration, that there can be -- as 

this Court discussed just last term in Concepcion, there 

21 can be class arbitration proceedings. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- but this

24 it?

1 this statute does not require that there be class
 

2 proceedings. I'm only addressing a hypothetical --

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Unless --

4  MR. McCONNELL: -- statute that did.


 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Unless we read the
 

6 disclosure requirement of a right to sue to mean that
 

7 you're entitled to bring your action in court. With
 

8 whatever protections, procedural and substantive
 

9 protections, that entails.


 MR. McCONNELL: Yes, and that seems to me 

11 just a further reason not to interpret a disclosure 

12 provision with a layman's language as importing, you 

13 know, very specific legal notions, that -- I think this 

14 simply means -- right to sue simply means cause of 

action. And it's -- each of the rights, I should point 

16 out, in the disclosure provision is -- has its actual 

17 textual home elsewhere. None of them are created in the 

18 disclosure provision. Each of them is created 

19 elsewhere, either in this statute or another. To find 

out exactly what they entail, you look to the 

21 substantive provisions. Here, you would look to 1679g, 

22 and you would see that class actions are possible but 

23 not required under this particular statute. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you in an 

agreement waive the provisions of 1679g(b) that specify

1 what a court shall consider in awarding punitive 

2 damages? 

3  MR. McCONNELL: I don't think so, 

4 Mr. Chief Justice. Most lower courts treat the right to 

punitive damages as a substantive right which would not 

6 be waivable. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, well what --

8 what if you don't want your arbitrator to consider those 

9 four requirements? Could you waive particular aspects? 

I mean, that tells you that -- first of all, it says, of 

11 course, "the court shall consider"; but I take it your 

12 position is when they say "the court," they mean the 

13 court or arbitrator? 

14  MR. McCONNELL: It means the decisionmaker. 

Many statutes of course refer to things that courts 

16 might do, even though those statutes can be vindicated 

17 in arbitration. Title VII, for example, has several 

18 provisions in which it says, if the court determines 

19 this, then it may do that, for example, issue 

injunctions and so forth. I -- when you import the 

21 substantive provisions of a statute into an arbitration 

22 proceeding, everything that would be substantively 

23 available from a court becomes available from -- from 

24 the arbitrator. And that's the way I would read the 

punitive damages section here.

1  I note, by the way -- if I might just 

2 respond to a few of the points made by my friend in 

3 response to questions -- begin with Justice Sotomayor's 

4 interesting question about the fact that the statute 

appears to make even offering a waiver, offering an
 

6 arbitration clause, a violation. It's actually even
 

7 worse than that for two reasons.
 

8  One is that under their reading, a
 

9 settlement is surely just as much a waiver as an
 

arbitration is. Now, they say, oh, well, that only 

11 means post-dispute waivers. But that is not what this 

12 statute says. This statute is about all waivers. In 

13 contrast to other statutes previously enacted, like the 

14 ADEA, which distinguish between pre-dispute and 

post-dispute waivers, this one does not. So, their 

16 position suggests that even a settlement offer is a 

17 violation of this statute. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, Mr. Nelson just 

19 said no, that their position doesn't suggest that, when 

I asked him about post-dispute and he brought up 

21 settlement as well. He said that their interpretation 

22 does not exclude a settlement in which the plaintiff 

23 agrees --

24  MR. McCONNELL: Well, Justice Ginsburg, that 

was his answer, but what that tells us is that he is not

Official 

1 giving us a plain language meaning of the statute, which 

2 is all that they have, right? Their entire position is 

3 based upon a plain language reading of the statute. 

4 Remember the way the Ninth Circuit begins its opinion by 

quoting Alice in Wonderland. It's -- it's all about 

6 plain language. But they do not offer us a plain 

7 language interpretation of this statute. In order to 

8 avoid absurd consequences like making settlement offers 

9 a violation of the statute, they have to create 

exceptions, unspecified exceptions, to the text. 

11  It would be much easier simply to follow the 

12 rules of construction that this Court had announced 

13 before this statute was enacted and against which 

14 Congress operated.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, one of those 

16 rules of construction is that you don't read statutes 

17 when -- to the extent they lead to absurd results. I 

18 mean, I think you can still say follow the plain 

19 language, but that doesn't mean you go so far as to say 

you can't enter into a settlement. 

21  MR. McCONNELL: I think it's easier, though, 

22 simply to assume that Congress was using words in the 

23 way that this Court used them in Gilmer just a few years 

24 before, that that's a much more straightforward way of 

reading the statute.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that a 

2 settlement is a waiver anyway. It's a vindication. You 

3 -- you vindicate your right to a settlement. I don't 

4 know that you waive it.

 MR. McCONNELL: Just as I think you can say 

6 that when you go to arbitration, you vindicate the 

7 substantive rights of the statute as well. And, indeed, 

8 this Court has used that very language in Mitsubishi 

9 with respect to -- to arbitration.

 The -- just a couple of other small points. 

11  My friend points out that this is the first 

12 statute in -- or that at the time of this statute in 

13 1996, that there had been no statute that explicitly 

14 barred arbitration, which is historically true but I 

think not particularly revealing. It was only in '85 in 

16 Mitsubishi and then '91 in Gilmer that Congress became 

17 aware that it needed to do this in statutory causes of 

18 action. In -- and by 1996, they were considering bills 

19 that explicitly voided arbitration clauses. They 

weren't enacted, but this is for political reasons. 

21 Remember the political composition of Congress in 1996. 

22  It is not surprising that statutes voiding 

23 arbitration agreements become more common when the 

24 political composition of the Congress changes. This is 

fundamentally a political choice, and ought to be -- we
