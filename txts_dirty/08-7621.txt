CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-7621, Sullivan v. Florida. 

Mr. Stevenson. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN STEVENSON 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. STEVENSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

Joe Sullivan was 13 years of age when he was 

arrested with two older boys, one 15 and one 17, charged 

with sexual assault, ultimately convicted, and sentenced 

to life without parole. 

Joe is one of only two children this age who 

have ever been sentenced to life without parole for a 

non-homicide, and no child has received this sentence 

for non-homicide in the last 18 years. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Stevenson, there’s a 

serious question before we get to the particulars of 

this case. Justice Kennedy suggested it in the last 

argument. This -- the time ran out for postconviction 

relief in 1993, and this petition is brought in 2007. 

There’s a 2-year statute of limitations. Florida 

said there’s a procedural bar; we don't get to the 

merits of this case.

MR. STEVENSON: Yes, there are two 

responses. I mean, first of all, with regard to 

challenges to sentences, Florida law, under Rule 3.850, 

makes it very clear that a challenge to a sentence can 

be brought at any time. What the trial court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They said there's a 

question whether that means an illegal sentence, like 

the judge gave more than the maximum punishment. Do you 

have any indication in Florida law that correcting a 

sentence any time overtakes the limitation on 

postconviction relief? 

MR. STEVENSON: Yes, we cite in our brief 

Summers v. State, which is an example of someone 

challenging their sentence after this Court's decision 

in Apprendi long after the time would have run. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except the court there 

applied 39(a) and said: Yes, it's a change in law, but 

it hasn't been made retroactive. 

MR. STEVENSON: That -- that's correct. But 

the propriety of that determination is exactly what can 

be -- is engaged in by the State courts, and that’s 

what we simply sought here. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't that what the 

court said here? It said, first of all, Roper doesn't 

command the results you are seeking; and, second, it

didn't make its application retroactive. So wasn't it 

really consistent with 39(a), the Florida court? 

MR. STEVENSON: No, Justice Sotomayor. The 

only thing the judge said here was that I don't 

think the reasoning of Roper can be applied to someone 

serving life in prison without parole. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, that's an unfair 

characterization. What the judge said was Roper didn't 

say that it applied to life without parole. That's a 

very -- vastly different thing than saying that the 

reasoning shouldn't be applied. It said that we are not 

choosing to, but that's not what Roper said. 

MR. STEVENSON: But our argument -- and I 

accept that. Our argument was we recognized that Roper 

dealt with the death penalty as opposed to life without 

parole, but our argument was that the reasoning of Roper 

is similarly applicable to someone sentenced to life 

imprisonment without parole. 

The trial judge could not evaluate the 

procedural question without analyzing Roper, and that's 

what the trial court did. The trial court conceded that 

if Roper applies, Joe Sullivan is entitled to review. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But Roper was decided under 

a regime, which I -- I think still exists, that death is 

different. How could it possibly be thought to apply to

this case, which is not a death case? 

MR. STEVENSON: Well, because -- because 

what the Court said in Roper categorically for the first 

time is that kids are different, and in this context we 

were arguing --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It said kids are different 

for purposes of the death penalty, which is different. 

MR. STEVENSON: Well, I think our argument 

was that they are different for the purposes of 

sentencing. And what triggered this -- and this is why 

this is relevant to this procedural question -- was that 

the State of Florida did apply Roper to juveniles who 

had been sentenced to death after this Court's decision. 

And the case we cited to the Florida appeals 

court, Bonifay v. Florida -- it's on page 38 of our 

joint appendix -- was a case where Florida implemented 

that law, and the law under Florida was that death row 

prisoners sentenced at the time of Joe Sullivan --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let me -- let me --

MR. STEVENSON: -- had their sentences 

reduced to life in prison with parole. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But this judge said: 

Yes, there’s a Federal question in this case: Does 

Roper render unconstitutional life without parole for 

juveniles? He answered that question: no. And then he

said: There is no other Federal question in the case; I 

do not reach the question that you are raising, that is, 

life without parole being cruel and unusual. All -- the 

only Federal question that, under our rules, I reach is, 

does Roper cover this case? No. Anything else is 

procedurally barred. 

What was wrong with that? 

MR. STEVENSON: Well, because under your 

precedent, if the question -- if the judgment of 

procedural default is dependent on an analysis, an 

assessment of Federal law, in any context, then it is 

not an independent and adequate State ground, and that's 

the basis on which we --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose arguendo we 

assume that the judge is right, that Roper did not 

establish a rule that applies in this case. Then what 

position are you in with reference to the procedural 

bar? Do you have any other arguments that overcome the 

procedural bar? 

MR. STEVENSON: Yes, that is the rule would 

still allow us to challenge the sentence under the no­

time restriction as it relates to the sentence --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no. The only Federal 

question in the case now -- or at least the preliminary 

Federal question, the threshold Federal question, is

simply whether the State court was right about what 

Roper did. And if we agree with the State court about 

what Roper did, then the State's bar automatically 

applies and that's the end of the case. 

MR. STEVENSON: Well, yes, but if you agree 

with the State court about Roper did, then we don't --

we are not entitled to relief under -- under either 

theory, under a merits theory or a default theory, but 

the point is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I don't -- I don't know 

about that. We -- is the argument here that, unless 

Roper mandates this result, you don't urge that the 

Constitution requires it? I don't think so. 

MR. STEVENSON: No. Our argument simply is 

that the question that the trial judge dealt with here 

was, in part, dependent on an assessment of the Federal 

Constitution, whether the Eighth Amendment does 

constrain a sentence like this. We relied on Roper. 

The court found that Roper was not available 

to Mr. Sullivan when his case was on appeal, prior to 

1993. Based on that determination, the court then 

engaged in an analysis. And, again, what triggered 

this -- and I just want to make this really clear, that 

death row prisoners after Roper in Florida got a better 

sentence than Joe Sullivan.

They got life with parole eligibility after 

25 years. The argument was that that established a 

reasonable basis for Joe Sullivan –-

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought -- I thought 

Simmons got life without parole. I thought that 

Simmons's sentence was life without parole. 

MR. STEVENSON: Simmons did, Your Honor, in 

Missouri. But in Florida, at the point at which these 

sentences were being imposed, there was no life without 

parole for capital murder. People convicted of capital 

murder could -- could only be sentenced to life in 

prison, with parole eligibility after 25 years. 

And so the question was generated by this 

Court's decision in Roper, how is it constitutional 

under the Eighth Amendment for the death sentence 

prisoner to get life with parole after 25 years, and Joe 

Sullivan at 13, convicted of a non-homicide --

JUSTICE ALITO: Your argument is that 

because the -- the State judge had to decide whether 

Roper dictated or required the result that you were 

asking for, that -- that it's not an independent State 

ground. That's the argument? 

MR. STEVENSON: My argument is that if Roper 

applied -- if Roper is relevant -- because what the 

State courts of Florida have said is that when you are

looking at this question there are three things. One, 

is it a rule from the Florida Supreme Court or United 

States Supreme Court? 

Two, is it a rule of constitutional -- of a 

constitutional nature? Which, obviously, this would be. 

Three, is it a rule of fundamental significance? That's 

all. We don't have to establish that --

JUSTICE ALITO: No, but I'm -- I'm 

interested in how we decide whether it's independent. 

If you had cited -- if you said Marbury v. Madison 

dictates this result, well, the judge would have to 

decide what Marbury v. Madison required. That’s a 

Federal -- that can be characterized as a Federal 

question. That would make the -- that would make it --

the State law ground not an independent ground? 

MR. STEVENSON: No, Your Honor. I mean, we 

could say that -- that some rule that has to do with 

antitrust applies, but the judge wouldn't have to 

consider that, wouldn't have to evaluate that; it 

wouldn't be determinative. Here, the judge could not 

reject our claim without an analysis of Roper. 

The judge engaged in that, and let -- let 

me just point out, this is not a case of procedural 

default, State court ruling, we are now in Federal 

habeas. This is a question about jurisdiction.

The question that the State is raising is: 

Does this Court have jurisdiction to review the Federal 

question that was presented below, when the trial court 

itself engaged in an analysis of Roper? This Court 

doesn't lose its jurisdiction to deal with a Federal 

question when the State court analyzed that question to 

reach its --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's true, but once 

we analyze the question, if we decide, as the trial 

court decided, that in fact Roper does not demand the 

result in this case and, therefore, there is no 

exception to the procedural bar of Florida, which makes 

an exception where the fundamental constitutional right 

asserted was not established within the period provided 

for, once we decide that in fact Roper didn't establish 

it, you're out of court, it seems to me. 

Then -- then, automatically, the -- the 

procedural bar of Florida applies. 

MR. STEVENSON: No, Justice Scalia. The 

other provision of 3.850 would still allow us to 

challenge this sentence because it is a challenge to a 

sentence, and Florida says that there is no time 

limitation on the challenge of a sentence. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then that would 

completely overtake the specific provision. I mean, if

you say the catchall illegal sentence, open to 

challenge at any time, then there’s nothing left to 

the specific provision that says 2-year statute of 

limitations, unless three things. 

MR. STEVENSON: That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. Florida applies the provision, the construct 

that, with regard to challenges to sentences, at least, 

there is no time limitation. 

We contend that the more relevant challenge 

is generated by this Court's decision in Roper. But, 

even without that, we are entitled to merits review, and 

no one has argued against that. 

I mean, it's worth stating here that there 

was no responsive pleading filed by the State in the 

trial court. There was no responsive pleading. No one 

asserted an affirmative defense arguing that these 

procedural defaults be --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you say the -- under 

Florida law, the question is not whether the right was, 

to use the phrase, "clearly established"? 

MR. STEVENSON: That's correct. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the right is whether 

or not -- it had -- what was your phrase? "A 

significant bearing"? 

MR. STEVENSON: That's right. That comes

from Summers v. State, which is cited in our brief, 

Justice Kennedy, where the court has made it clear, 

because they have to sometimes engage in these questions 

about what's retroactive, how does it apply? 

They have done that with regard to Apprendi. 

They have done that with regard to some of this Court's 

other decisions in a vast array of areas. Eighth 

Amendment questions come up all the time before the 

Florida Supreme Court under that analysis. And with 

that in context, I don't think there is any real 

question that this Court has jurisdiction, and that’s 

the issue here: Do you have jurisdiction to review the 

Federal question that was considered below? 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did -- did you raise below 

your assertion that the exception -- that there is an 

exception for challenging -- for vacating sentences, 

that there is -- that that is an exception to the normal 

rule of 2 years’ limitation? Did you make that 

argument below? 

MR. STEVENSON: No, because at no point did 

the State make any argument that we were barred or 

precluded in any way. On appeal, we did reference the 

provision in the -- in Bonifay v. State, which was a 

case that talked about how these provisions can be

challenged, how these sentences can be challenged at any 

time. 

That was the way the case was presented, 

Justice Scalia, because at no point did the State ever 

argue an affirmative defense of procedural default. And 

that's how the case gets here. It gets here in the 

posture of a very rare sentence. 

And I do want to respond to the notion that 

we are uncertain about what will happen. There’s no 

uncertainty about what will happen to Joe Sullivan if 

this Court rules in his favor. Florida law clearly 

states what the next sentencing option is. He could 

only be sentenced to 40 years in prison with good time 

and credits available. That's what Florida law says. 

Under 775.082, anyone not sentenced to life in prison 

can only receive a maximum sentence of 40 years. And 

that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why won't the next 

case we get be an argument that for a juvenile, 

particularly one as young as -- as your client, 40 years 

is too long; 40 years doesn't recognize his capacity for 

moral development within a reasonable period? 

MR. STEVENSON: Mr. Chief Justice, you may 

get that case and this Court will have to evaluate that. 

But I think here what we haven't resolved, which I think

we have to resolve, is the question of whether life 

without parole is unconstitutional, whether that's 

excessive. And I think there’s a great deal of 

evidence to support that this Court should make that 

finding, in part because of its lack of consensus. 

There are only nine kids in the entire 

country that have been sentenced to life without parole 

for any crime. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but -- I mean, 

you look at the Federal Government allows this sentence, 

right? Thirty-eight States allow this sentence. I just 

don't understand how you can say there is a consensus --

MR. STEVENSON: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that this type of 

sentence is unconstitutional. 

MR. STEVENSON: I think with regard to very 

young kids, I -- I don't think we can say that the 

States have adopted or considered or approached this 

kind of sentence, in part because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: All you have established is 

that there is a consensus that that sentence should be 

rare, not a consensus that that sentence should not be 

available, because most States make it available. 

MR. STEVENSON: I -- I think, Your Honor, 

that -- that the judgment that they have made it

available in some conscious way can't really be 

defended, because no one who has set the minimum age for 

imposing a sentence of life without parole has set it as 

young as -- as 13. When States have taken up this 

question, they have never said that a child of 13 should 

be subject to life without parole. What they said is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it would be -- it 

would be reasonable under your approach to have 

a different result in these two cases? A difference in 

terms of consensus or when sentencing is allowed would 

result in a different result in your case than in 

Mr. Graham's case? 

MR. STEVENSON: It would be conceivable. It 

wouldn't be desirable. I'll concede that. But, yes, 

it's conceivable only in the sense that we know that 

States like Florida that have created no minimum age for 

trying children as adults, but have created life without 

parole for these adult sentencers have created this 

world where these things are possible. 

But if you accept that Florida has adopted 

life without parole for a child of 13, you also have to 

accept that they have adopted it for a child of 6 or 5, 

because --

MR. STEVENSON: Sorry. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that 

one way to take that into effect is through our normal 

proportionality review and in a case by case. Your –-

your client -- his crime is horrendously violent. At 

the same time, he is much younger than in the typical 

case. And it seems to me that requiring under the 

Eighth Amendment consideration of his age, as I said 

earlier, I guess, avoids all these line-drawing problems 

which seem -- the arbitrariness of the line-drawing 

seems inconsistent with the notion of the Eighth 

Amendment. 

MR. STEVENSON: I understand your point, 

Mr. Chief Justice, but I don't think that’s the way the 

Court should proceed, for two reasons: One -- one is 

that that kind of case by case analysis hasn't worked 

well for children. It is in part because these kids are 

so vulnerable, are so at risk in this system, that 

they end up --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought -- I 

would have thought your argument that this is so rare 

suggests that maybe that analysis, to the extent it’s 

permitted under State law, has worked well for children. 

MR. STEVENSON: Well, but -- but I -- I 

think in many ways it -- it hasn't. I mean, Joe

Sullivan never had his case reviewed, never had his 

sentence reviewed. The lawyer filed an Anders brief on 

direct appeal. He's been in prison for 20 years and 

wouldn't be in this Court but for this Court's decision 

in Roper that created some new categorical exemptions. 

And I think the problem with the 

individualized review, as Justice Kennedy wrote actually 

in Roper, is that in this context, age can actually be 

an aggravating factor. I mean, the Court could have 

said in the death penalty context, let's deal with this 

on a case-by-case basis. We actually have a 

proportionality review that's enshrined in our capital 

jurisprudence. States have to do that. 

But we didn't, because we recognize that 

there are distinctions between kids and adults that have 

to be respected by our Constitution, that have to be 

reflected in our constitutional norms. And I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because 

death is different, is what we said, and because death 

is reserved, as this Court said in Roper, for the worst 

of the worst. And we know that life without parole is 

not reserved for the worst of the worst. 

MR. STEVENSON: But I think it is, Your 

Honor, for -- for -- for the kinds of crimes that we are 

talking -- for non-homicides, life without parole is

reserved for the worst of the worst. That's what this 

Court effectively created with its decision in Kennedy. 

And in that context, the same difference 

that can be made between kids and adults in the death 

penalty context, we believe, needs to be made here. To 

equate the crime of a 13-year-old with a 25- or a 

30-year-old, particularly one like Joe Sullivan --

JUSTICE SCALIA: There are a lot of 

murderers who get life without parole. Not every 

murderer gets -- gets executed. So how can you say that 

these are worst of the worst? Murderers are the worst 

of the worst, and they get life without parole. 

MR. STEVENSON: Yes, they do, 

Justice Scalia. But my point is that, with regard to 

non-homicides, life without parole occupies the same 

kind of end-of-the-line status that the death penalty 

does with homicide. And to fail to make a distinction 

between --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Call them the "worse of the 

worse" maybe, but they are not the worst of the worst. 

MR. STEVENSON: Well, that's one way of 

characterizing it. I think, though, whatever we say 

about children and adults, we know that there are 

distinctions, and those distinctions that were 

articulated in Roper are applicable here.

JUSTICE ALITO: What is the categorical rule 

that you would like us to adopt? 

MR. STEVENSON: I would like you to adopt 

a rule that bans life without parole for any child 

under the age of 14. And I think that would be 

supported by the judgment -- that ruling wouldn't 

actually invalidate a single State law. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that would leave out 

Graham, then? Your rule, you say under the age of 14, 

so you are distinguishing your case from Graham's? You 

are not saying all juveniles, just -- you are setting 

the line at 14? 

MR. STEVENSON: Well, I support -- my client 

is 13, and there are differences between kids who are 14 

and younger and kids who are older. But I support a 

line that actual draws the line at 18. I think that 

that distinction can and should be made. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not Thompson, where 

the line was 16? 

MR. STEVENSON: Well, I mean, the difficulty 

of course, is that -- and Thompson was a plurality 

opinion. We don't -- you could draw the line anywhere. 

And we briefed our case recognizing that this Court has 

discretion. There could be distinctions that could be 

made between younger kids and older kids, but we

certainly support a judgment that all children should be 

shielded from this age difference. 

The reason why we make that distinction is 

because that there are legal distinctions. There are 

States that have set the minimum age for trying kids or 

imposing these sentences of life without parole at 16 or 

17. We do recognize long traditions on the age of 14. 

In the Court's opinion in Stanford v. 

Kentucky authored by Justice Scalia -- you referenced 

this earlier -- at common law we recognize that there 

was a rebuttable presumption that children 14 and 

younger could not be tried for felonies, that they were 

incapable. And so, we are just arguing that these 

distinctions can be made. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what about a 

homicide, a 13-year-old? 

MR. STEVENSON: It’s our position that, 

based on the incidence of these sentences, that even 

between non-homicide and homicide, no child of 13 

should be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. 

That is, only -- in 44 States, no child for any kind of 

crime has received that kind of sentence. And this 

notion that we -- we have to think about who children 

are in the context of this -- for the crime of rape, the 

median sentence in this country is 10 years.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you are 

differentiating your position based on young age from 

Graham's counsel, who said for murder, even in the case 

of a youthful offender, life without parole is an 

appropriate -- is an available sentence? 

MR. STEVENSON: That's -- that's right, Your 

Honor. That -- that is, we think that the data, that is 

the consensus, would support both from an age 

perspective and from a consensus perspective an absolute 

ban on life without parole for any child of 13. It --

it has been rejected by virtually every State in terms 

of its application. It has been rejected by many States 

in terms of its even concept. I mean, there are a lot 

of States in this country where you can't get any kind 

of adult sentence for a crime at 13. We don't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your line is 13, 

and for obvious reasons. Another line is going to be 16 

for obvious reasons. When the 15-year-old comes in, he 

is going to say 15, the 17-year-old -- and that it seems 

to me is why drawing the line on the basis of the Eighth 

Amendment -- there’s certainly nothing in the Eighth 

Amendment that suggests there is a difference between 16 

and 17. Everybody with a different client is going to 

have a different line, which suggests to me that it 

ought to be considered in each individual case.

MR. STEVENSON: I guess we make these 

categorical distinctions in lots of contexts, not just 

in the death penalty context. We appended to our brief 

hundreds of laws that draw lines, that say if you are 14 

you can't drive, you can't enter into a contract. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's 

because that's a policy judgment by the legislature. 

Here we are talking about the dictates of the Eighth 

Amendment. And the idea that the Eighth Amendment draws 

those kinds of arbitrary distinctions is one that I 

don't understand. 

MR. STEVENSON: Well, it is this Court's 

history. That is, in Thompson you drew a line between 

15 and those who are younger. In -- in -- in Roper you 

have drawn the line at 18 and 17. In other contexts, we 

wrestle with this all the time. In Atkins, you had to 

draw a line of defining mental retardation in some 

sphere. 

What we are ultimately arguing is that there 

are people who are vulnerable, that there are people who 

need protection, and children are some of those people. 

Their diminished capacity, their diminished culpability, 

their inability to be responsible, their vulnerability 

to negative peer pressures, and their capacity to change 

and reform is what we think generates this question, and

we think it's an honest question. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on how horrible 

the crime is that they've committed, doesn't it? But 

you say it doesn't. It doesn't depend upon how horrible 

it is and how much retribution society demands. 

MR. STEVENSON: I think for -- for a child 

of 13 with regard to a sentence of life imprisonment 

without parole, that is correct, Justice Scalia. 

I think in our construct, where we don't 

always impose these sentences even for those horrible 

offenders, to not recognize the difference between a 

child and an adult is cruel and unusual. To say to the 

13-year-old in this case that you get life without 

parole, but to the 17-year-old you get 4 years and 

you are released in 6 months, or to the 15-year-old 

you get juvenile treatment, speaks to the kind of 

difficulty we have with the absence of a categorical 

ban. 

We make these bans all the time. And I 

think that the States are capable of implementing them. 

We cite Gerstein v. Pugh as an example where this Court 

found time between arrest and presentation to be 

violative of constitutional norms, and the States were 

empowered to implement that. 

With regard to Joe Sullivan, we don't have

to speculate. We know what the sentence will be. If he 

is returned and resentenced, he will be sentenced up to 

40 years, or actually the points that were applied to 

him would recommend a sentence between 27 years and 

40 years. And we don't contend that that would be 

violative of the Constitution, because there is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you go back 

through the statistics for me? For children under 14, 

how many are in prison for life without parole for 

homicide and non-homicide cases? 

MR. STEVENSON: There are 73 children 14 and 

younger who have been imprisoned for life without 

parole. They can be found in only 18 States. For the 

age of 13 and younger, there are only nine kids, and 

that's including both kids convicted of homicide and 

non-homicide. 

For non-homicide, there are only two. They 

are both in Florida, and Joe Sullivan is one of them. 

So the universe of children under 14 and younger is 

very, very small, smaller than what this Court was 

dealing with in Roper in terms of the number of death 

sentences, smaller than what this Court was likely 

dealing with in Atkins. It's what this Court has looked 

at generally to find consensus. And here, where only 18 

States have imposed these sentences, a judgment that

MR. STEVENSON: And with regard to children 

younger, we're also talking about just the universe of 

six, 14 and younger, all in Florida. And so it is this

JUSTICE ALITO: What is your response to the 

State's argument that these statistics are not

that you generated yourself? 

MR. STEVENSON: Well, these statistics come 

from the States’ Departments of Corrections, Your Honor. 

I mean, we -- we gave the State -- the State doesn't 

contest our data, at least in their pleading, and we 

don't control these numbers. The Departments of 

Corrections control these numbers, and where these data 

are within their power of the State to present, we 

don't think there’s any real question about the 

reliability of the data that we are relying on. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There’s a certain 

number of States that didn't respond at all. 

MR. STEVENSON: There are very few. In one 

study, there were only two States. In the report that 

we generated, we got the information from all States. 

I see my white light is on. I’d like to 

reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

parole, under the age of 18 when committed. 

MR. MAKAR: One hundred and fifty. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And they say 77? 

MR. MAKAR: They say 77. That's correct. 

The reason being is that the study they're relying upon, 

which was generated this summer while this case was 

pending –-

JUSTICE BREYER: What? Sorry. 

MR. MAKAR: I'm sorry. The reason it's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You are speaking too fast. 

I can't understand you. 

MR. MAKAR: I apologize, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe if you raise the --

raise the lectern a bit -- no, the other way. 

MR. MAKAR: The reason why is that the 

Annino study upon which they rely, which was generated 

just this past summer, doesn't count a non-homicide 

offense that happens to also be bundled with a homicide 

offense. 

So, for example, if someone went down the 

street, committed an armed burglary as Graham did, but 

then they went across the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Let's -- let's count 

it their way. Let's say that a -- non-homicide --

first? He's there for the homicide offense or for the 

non-homicide offense? 

MR. MAKAR: This is an individual that they 

don't count. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MR. MAKAR: And this is a person who 

committed, for example, an armed burglary. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. MAKAR: And then -- and put in jail and 

sentenced to life without parole. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: For the burglary, not for 

the --

MR. MAKAR: Right, non-homicide. But they 

happened, as the course of a crime spree, to commit a 

homicide offense down the road at a different location. 

They don't count that sentence for the non-homicide 

offense in their data. They undercount the data 

dramatically. 

And in addition, the States -- this is not 

an easy issue. The States have primary offenses and 

secondary offenses. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so in your example, 

Mr. Smith was sentenced to life without parole for a 

robbery. Then you said Mr. Smith also killed someone.

whatever?

could count that as a homicide offense. I understand 

your point.

it; in other words, for argument's purpose, concede 

that where there is also a homicide offense, it counts 

as homicide, not in the set I am asking you about.

non-homicide offenses, life without parole, and they 

were under the age of 18 when committed. How 

many in Florida?

say 77.

said that the reason for the difference was a set of 

instances that I just asked you to put to the side.

is worse? A 16-year-old committing the crimes that 

Graham committed; a 13-year-old committing the crimes 

that Sullivan committed?

mean, under the Eighth Amendment, which would be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is, if you 

had to consider youth as one of the factors that we 

consider under proportionality analysis, how do you come 

out?

case we are at the far extreme. We’re off the charts. 

This is one of those unfathomable --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Off the charts on 

age or off the charts on violence? 

MR. MAKAR: Violence, I'm sorry. The 

violence meaning that this is one of the most severe 

violent acts that any human being could perpetuate upon 

anyone else. It was done twice; there was two counts. 

So in that regard --

he committed the offense in two different ways upon this 

woman, and --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your adversary 

provided statistics to show that other people who have 

committed rapes have gotten much smaller terms of 

imprisonment, the average being, I think we were told, 

10 years. 

So explain to me why someone who commits a 

rape is getting 10 years and this 13-year-old -- it’s 

the most heinous crime for a 13-year-old that justifies 

life without parole. 

MR. MAKAR: Well, when we look at the data 

for sexual battery, there’s a distribution, and there’s 

all kinds of factors underlying each of those 

sentences, and we have hundreds of sexual battery 

sentences in Florida. Each one is unique, and each one 

is presented to the trial judge who makes the 

determination about the sentence. 

And there are very harsh sentences, 

certainly, for some offenses and not for others. But to 

take the notion that one could average them together and 

walk into court and say, I'm way above the average, I 

should somehow get an Eighth Amendment remedy, we

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, what is the right -- go 

ahead. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I think if you want 

to address it, that the basic argument here is we want a 

bright line. And the justification for the bright line 

is (a) it's pretty unusual to have this. So that is 

one part of the clause. And in respect to it being 

cruel, you go back to what is supposed to be some kind 

of rough, basic connection between criminal law and 

generally accepted principles of morality. 

And the confusion and uncertainty about 

the moral responsibility of a 13-year-old is such that 

it is not -- it is a cruel thing to do to remove from 

that individual his entire life. You say we’re at the 

extreme. Now that's roughly what’s 

perking around in my mind, and I would like you to reply 

to that. 

MR. MAKAR: Well, certainly -- and I've got, 

Mr. Chief Justice, questions about how does age play a 

role in proportionality and so forth. And I think here 

that a 13-year-old can commit the most heinous of 

crimes.

JUSTICE BREYER: That wasn't my point. I 

guess I wasn't clear. My point was, of course, there 

can be cases in any set which go in all kinds of 

different directions. But, as a general matter, human 

beings are uncertain about how much moral responsibility 

to assign to individuals in a particular category, and 

that category roughly corresponds with an age of 

maturity. 

So you get into arguments when you get to 

10, no; 11, no; 17, yes maybe; 16, yes maybe. But 

as long as we are around 3 years old, 5, 7, 

9, 12, and they want to say certainly 14, we are in 

that area of ambiguity. And not just we, people all 

over America, some thinking one way, some thinking 

another. And that's enough to cut the connection with 

morality, a strong enough connection that could justify 

taking the person's entire life away. 

You see, I'm trying to make a general 

argument, and maybe I haven't stated it perfectly. But 

if you can get the drift of what I'm talking about, I 

would like to hear your reply. 

MR. MAKAR: Sure. Well, I think what you 

are getting to, Justice Breyer, is that --- two things:

point, which is that this is a good thing. It's -- it's 

a lawful sentence that can be imposed, but it's rare. 

And we are -- we should be proud of that, that it 

doesn't occur with a -- with a great regularity. It's 

an unfortunate thing that it happens, that we have these 

gross acts of depravity that would justify it even for 

someone that’s very young. 

Sullivan is not here to tell the Court: I 

should not be punished. He has told the Court: I can 

be in jail for the rest of my life. All he is asking 

for is this opportunity to get out, this parole 

opportunity. That's what -- what we are talking about. 

And this issue that he has presented obviously was not 

one the Florida trial court could have addressed 

whatsoever. 

Justice Ginsburg, you hit the nail on the 

head. To interpret the rules the way they are 

interpreting our rules in Florida would swallow the 

3.850(b)(2) exception that says --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you tell -- tell us 

something about that catchall that says an illegal 

sentence can be reopened at any time, illegal 

sentence? What -- Mr. Stevenson said that is not 

limited to just -- the maximum is 15 years and the

MR. MAKAR: Well, that's incorrect. The two 

rules he is citing to at this point -- one raised in the 

reply brief -- deal with motions to correct a sentence 

that exceeds limits provided by law -- that exceeds 

the limits provided by law. And the Florida courts have 

held that this is -- in these situations, it’s the law 

in effect at the time of the sentencing. In other 

words, if -- and -- and then there’s the exception 

under 3.850(b)(2) that says --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That wouldn't apply to the 

Eighth Amendment? 

MR. MAKAR: No, because 3.850(b)(2) -- well, 

I think if, for example, at the time of sentencing --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: We’re talking about the 

first sentence of (B), I take it? 

MR. MAKAR: Right. That's the one they’re 

relying upon: A motion to vacate a sentence that 

exceeds the time limits provided by law may be filed at 

any time. That has been interpreted in the Florida 

courts not to allow a new constitutional right that has 

been applied retroactively to be raised. It’s applied 

to say: At the time of your sentencing, on the face of 

it, can -- was there an error that was made? 

Okay. And -- and to interpret it their way

would swallow the exception. Florida is entitled, like 

every other State, to create a limited exception under 

its postconviction rules to say: We are only going to 

consider new fundamental constitutional rights that are 

applied retroactively. 

I think, simply put, the Florida trial court 

couldn't answer the question they want this Court to now 

answer. It was beyond the trial court's jurisdiction. 

The court below couldn't create a new right, extend one, 

or make it retroactive. The trial court did what we 

would expect the trial court to do here, is 

take a quick look: What are you asking me to do? Do 

you want me to apply Roper in a context that it doesn't 

state? I can't do that. The rule 3.850(b)(2) says I 

can't do that. 

And the judge said it on the record here, 

Joint Appendix 56, 57, and 58: The claim does not fit 

into the limited category of claims allowed to be 

brought after the expiration of the 2-year period. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, what -- during the 

-- during the time, the postconviction period, would he

that he has a lawyer in 2007. In between, was counsel 

available to Sullivan?

Justice Ginsburg. I mean, he did file a pro se State 

postconviction challenging the -- the failure to have a 

semen sample taken and the failure to examine one of his

pleading. I have looked at it, and it -- it is 

actually not bad. It was one, I guess, that was

following: You have to file a challenge within 2 

years. There are three exceptions to that. One and 

three clearly don't apply. And as to two, Roper isn't 

clear enough to make it apply. 

Their response to that is there is no 

Florida law that says you have to challenge a sentence 

within 2 years. That Florida courts -- and then they 

have, like, 14 cases listed here. And the Supreme Court 

of Florida has said that when you are trying to correct 

an illegal sentence, that whole part of the statute does 

not apply. Okay? What's the response to that? 

MR. MAKAR: That's not what those cases 

stand for. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So what I should do 

is go look up and see what those cases hold, and -- and 

you said to the lower court or the court of appeals --

you said their argument is wrong. The 2-year statute 

does apply. The 2-year statute does apply. There are 

three exceptions, and you do not fit within section (B) 

because. Where did you say that? 

MR. MAKAR: I don't believe there was any 

State brief filed in opposition to his appeal. That the 

first district PCA --

MR. MAKAR: Didn't deny -- I’m sorry. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So the State -- he says 

that whole section doesn't apply. There is no 2-year 

statute. And you say Florida did not reply in a brief 

to that argument? 

MR. MAKAR: No, because I think it was so 

obvious from the trial judge's order that he was relying 

on the procedural bar of 3.850(b)(2). The trial court 

had no -- the trial court couldn't do anything. The 

trial court couldn't say --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 

MR. MAKAR: -- I think -- I think Roper 

applies. And he said it just doesn't apply here. It's 

barred. I -- I can't do anything more with it. So --

and I think the fact that he took a quick look at the 

Roper decision and made that determination under Florida 

law -- this Court said in footnote 10 in Harris v. Reed 

that the trial court shouldn't be fearful of looking at 

the Federal issue for -- for fear of having it come up 

as being a -- establishing Federal jurisdiction. And 

then in Tyler v. Cain, this Court had a retroactivity 

issue presented to it as well. 

JUSTICE BREYER: In any case, there is a 

circularity point here, I guess. If we were to say in 

our opinion -- if we were to say that Roper does hold

that there is a fundamental constitutional right which 

we extend to this case and it applies here, and it 

applies to the -- retroactively to those whose --

certainly those who are raising the issue, then we would 

send it back and Florida now would not bar it under this 

statute, because it would fall squarely within the 

exception. Is that right? 

MR. MAKAR: That's exactly right, Justice 

Breyer. If in the Graham case you have a categorical 

rule that says 18 and under, then prospectively that 

line is established, and Sullivan could file a 

postconviction motion under 3.850(b)(2) and pursue it. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You did say in -- in your 

brief that if Graham should prevail in his petition, 

that Sullivan would get the benefit of that decision. 

How, if we -- if we say -- just say there was an 

adequate independent State ground and we have no 

authority to do anything more, how would -- how would 

Sullivan get the benefit of the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would -- would 

the standards applied in that situation be any different 

than the standards that would apply if you prevailed on 

his reading of the procedural bar? 

MR. MAKAR: I'm –-

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm just trying to 

see if this jurisdictional issue makes any difference. 

If you are saying -- it sounds to me like you're saying, 

well, if he wins, he wins, and, if he loses, he loses. 

I don't think he cares whether it's under the procedural 

bar or some other basis. 

MR. MAKAR: Well, I think that -- but his 

winning would be hinging upon Graham, rather than 

winning in this forum today, on a new claim, that the 

trial court had no jurisdiction to consider in the first 

instance. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: If I understand you 

correctly, you are saying he could lose here on the 

procedural bar, and then win later in the State courts. 

Is that right?

apply Apprendi after? Did it rule that it wasn't 

retroactive? What did it do in those cases --

MR. MAKAR: Well, my --

can't tell you all -- what all the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you are wrong and 

they did do exactly what your adversary said and 

considered the issue of the legality of the sentence 

under Apprendi, does that vitiate your argument here? 

Is your -- does that make your adversary's argument

here or there that may deviate from the rule would 

establish the precedent. I think they -- they’ve cited,

Carter v. State of the Florida Supreme Court, which I 

think has a pretty good recitation of how the rule 

operates. 

And it may be that there’s a Fifth District 

case they rely upon, where the -- the language is a 

little squishy, but those are -- those are anomalies, 

and they are not the rule in Florida. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if it's not 

consistently applied, then it's not an adequate ground. 

If so -- if the citations are correct and Florida 

sometimes treats it as rigid and sometimes doesn't, 

then it's not a consistently applied -- not an adequate 

State ground. 

MR. MAKAR: Well, there is no question that 

3.850(b)(2) is consistently and regularly applied. 

These other rules, I would submit, are consistently and 

regularly applied. 

The one -- the two Fifth District opinions 

they cite -- I have looked at them and the language 

there, it's ambiguous, it's not exactly clear, but I 

don't think that the lower court, the lower appellate 

court's rulings would override the Florida Supreme Court 

who controls the rules. They set the rules in Florida. 

They have rulemaking authority. That, somehow, that 

would throw out the adequacy of the -- of the State law

In conclusion, if there are no other 

questions, we ask that the Court dismiss this on 

jurisdictional grounds. Alternatively, we ask, as to 

this case and the others, that -- that the questions 

presented should be addressed and answered, which is 

whether there’s a categorical ban and -- that they do 

not -- a categorical ban does not exist. Thank you.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You are missing the 

point. What Florida says and what your adversary is 

saying is -- you’re absolutely right, if you win under 

Graham, you could go under 39.a -- if you win under 

Graham, and Graham makes its rule retroactive, that fits 

right into (b)(2) directly, and so those cases you have 

no problems with. 

What he is saying, however, is you can't go 

in to Florida and ask them to announce the 

constitutional rule under a case where it hasn't been 

already held. 

MR. STEVENSON: Well, I -- and that's what I 

disagree with, Your Honor. That's exactly what the 

court is doing in Hughes. That's exactly what the court 

is doing in these other cases. Otherwise, a lot of this 

Court's rules don't have clear and direct categorical 

lines. 

You have to apply them. You have to apply 

them in context. And it would mean that people whose 

sentences are now illegal under the law, only when 

applied, would be so banned, and that's what I don't 

think the Florida legislature or the Florida courts are 

saying.

footnote 35 of your reply brief, and it would have been 

a little bit helpful if you had raised it initially, so 

that the State would have had an opportunity to reply, 

but you introduced the citation there with “for 

example,” and then you cite some cases. Are there 

others? 

MR. STEVENSON: Yes -- yes, there are, 

Justice Alito, and -- and, again, I just want to 

contextualize why this is the way it is. At no point 

did the State make any of these arguments in the lower 

courts. They did make it at trial. They did not make 

it on appeal. This issue was raised for the first time 

in this Court. 

JUSTICE ALITO: There are -- there are other 

cases in which the lower Florida courts have used --

have said that this particular subsection is appropriate 

for raising a constitutional challenge. 

MR. STEVENSON: That's correct. There are 

other situations where they have made Eighth Amendment 

claims and analyses, and sometimes the petitioners 

lose; sometimes they prevail. They have done it in 

other contexts. And so I do think that it’s quite 

clear, from the way Florida applies these cases, that 

this Court has jurisdiction.

cert petition, which I don't have with me, you raised 

the question of the adequate State ground in the second 

question. 

MR. STEVENSON: We did -- well, what we 

raised was that, without this Court intervening, that 

people like Joe Sullivan would likely never get review. 

Our point was that, without an intervention from this 

Court, people like Joe Sullivan -- there hasn't been a 

sentence like --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was a question 

that you raised, and then your opening brief doesn't 

discuss it at all. Your reply brief responds to the 

State and then brings up something in a footnote that 

the State doesn't have a chance to answer. 

That doesn't seem, to me, a very sound way 

to approach a question that you, yourself, raised. 

MR. STEVENSON: Yes. Justice Ginsburg, we 

read that second question to be should this Court take 

an interest in a case? Should this Court be barred? 

Should this Court intervene where a child of 13 has been 

sentenced to life without parole, and there may never be 

another example? He can't go to Federal habeas corpus 

because he is time-barred from that. So this Court's 

opportunity to review the case is critical. That's what 

we thought we were raising in the second question.

Frankly, we thought that the jurisdictional 

question was a question that was pretty clear -- plain 

on its face because the trial court's disposition of the 

this case was completely dependent on its interpretation 

of Roper, and I think that's what gives this Court 

jurisdiction. 

You have said, repeatedly, in 

Ohio v. Reiner, in Ake v. Oklahoma, when the analysis of 

a State procedural rule does depend on an assessment of 

the Federal law, you have jurisdiction. 

And I think that jurisdiction should be 

exercised in this case to declare that this sentence is 

unconstitutional. It is unquestionably unusual to 

have -- no child of 13 in this country sentenced to life 

without parole in 44 States makes it clear that this is 

an unusual sentence. 

But we also contend to say to any child of 

13 that you are only fit to die in prison is cruel. It 

can't be reconciled with what we know about the nature 

of children, about the character of children. It cannot 

be reconciled with our standards of decency, and we 

believe that the Constitution obligates us to enforce 

those standards and reverse this judgment. 

My time is up. Thank you.
