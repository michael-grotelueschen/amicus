 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 07-1529, Montejo v. 

Louisiana.

 Mr. Verrilli.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The question in this case is whether 

Petitioner Montejo should be denied the Sixth Amendment 

protections of Michigan v. Jackson because he silently 

acquiesced in the appointment of counsel at his initial 

hearing, rather than affirmatively accepting the 

appointment. The Louisiana Supreme Court believed that 

an affirmative acceptance was required to trigger 

Jackson and therefore upheld the admission of a 

confession elicited during police-initiated 

interrogation after Montejo's Sixth Amendment right had 

attached and after a lawyer had been appointed to 

represent him.

 If Jackson applies, that confession should 

not have been admitted, and Jackson should apply because 

nothing in this Court's precedents or, frankly, in

common sense supports a rule that affords less Sixth 

Amendment protection to defendants who are automatically 

appointed counsel at initial hearings than to defendants 

who are appointed counsel after a request for 

counsel has --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that the 

rationale of Jackson was that the confession is simply 

deemed to be coerced if the defendant has expressed --

has expressed -- his desire to have counsel present or 

even to be represented by counsel. It isn't clear that, 

which is already a stretch, to assume that simply 

because I said, you know, I would like to have counsel, 

if the police continue to say, well, come on, won't you 

talk to us -- it's already a stretch to say it's 

automatically coerced.

 But now you're saying, even if the defendant 

has never expressed even a desire to be represented by 

counsel but has simply had counsel appointed, in fact 

even if he doesn't know about the appointment of 

counsel, the -- his confession is automatically deemed 

to be coerced. That seems to me quite, even more 

extravagant than Jackson.

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I don't -- without 

taking up at the moment the question whether Jackson was 

extravagant, it does seem to me, Your Honor, that your

question does get to the heart of the matter. In a 

situation like Jackson, the defendant requested counsel 

and that was deemed to be an election of the right to 

rely on counsel, not merely at the initial hearing but 

for all purposes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Right. What has he 

elected here?

 MR. VERRILLI: And the question here, it 

seems to me, Your Honor, is what does one do when a 

defendant is automatically appointed counsel? There are 

two options: One is to treat that defendant as having 

elected the right to rely on counsel, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? Why would one do 

that?

 MR. VERRILLI: And the other option is to 

deem that the defendant has decided to go it alone. 

Those are the two possibilities here, and it seems to me 

that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry to 

interrupt, but isn't there a third, which is that you 

just don't assume anything and you wait to see if he 

makes -- says, "I want to talk to my lawyer," or he 

could well say, "You've told me," as was the case here, 

"I have a right to a lawyer, I don't have to say 

anything, I want to talk some more, I don't -- okay,

there's a lawyer, fine, I want to talk without my 

lawyer, I want to waive my right to counsel." Which he 

can do.

 MR. VERRILLI: I think the problem, Mr. 

Chief Justice, is that in the -- it is an either/or 

choice because, if you -- if the defendant is deemed to 

have elected to rely on counsel on the basis of the 

appointment, then the police may not initiate 

interrogation. It's only if the defendant --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. If you 

prevail and you say silence constitutes saying "I want 

to talk to my lawyer," that's right. I'm saying that's 

a false, a false alternative.

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I don't think so. I 

think if the police initiate interrogation after a 

lawyer has been automatically appointed, then that 

interrogation either has to be deemed to be in violation 

of the rule of Jackson or not, and that seems to me to 

depend on how you characterize what happens in the 

course of an automatic appointment. If you --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Verrilli, the 

defendant himself could say, "Police, I'd like to talk 

to you." That would be okay. But this is police 

initiation.

 MR. VERRILLI: That's absolutely the

critical point, Justice Ginsburg. This is a limited 

rule, and the free choice of the defendant to initiate a 

conversation with the authorities is always present. 

The question is, what do we do in an automatic 

appointment situation? And this is a significant 

question because -- and I would refer the Court to the 

appendix, to the amicus brief of the National Legal Aid 

and Defender Association, which I think is a helpful 

reference here. It goes through each State, and what it 

shows is that approximately half the States have 

procedures in which, as a matter of course, the 

defendant is asked at the hearing whether he or she 

wants counsel, and if the defendant says yes, then we're 

in a Jackson situation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want to make sure I 

understood your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question. 

Assume a lawyer is appointed. The defendant says, "Yes, 

I want my lawyer." He's in the jail cell. The 

policeman walks by, he says, "I have a lawyer, but I 

want to talk to you now." Can the police talk to him?

 MR. VERRILLI: Yes, if he initiates. 

Initiation is the key. Initiation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Well, then it 

seems to me that the Miranda protections give you all --

or, the Miranda rules give you all the protection you

need.

 MR. VERRILLI: I don't think so, Justice 

Kennedy. A couple things. First of all, it seems to me 

that to reach that conclusion that the Court really 

would have to overrule what is a key holding in Jackson, 

and I don't think that that would be appropriate to do 

in this case for a whole host of reasons.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm wondering if 

there is some further rule, could the prosecutor talk to 

the defendant if the defendant was in the cell and the 

prosecutor walked by, saying, "I know you have an 

attorney, but I would like to talk to you"? Could the 

prosecutor do that consistently with the Sixth 

Amendment?

 MR. VERRILLI: Yes. It depends on 

initiation. It depends on who initiates.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Really? The lawyer --

MR. VERRILLI: If the defendant --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The lawyer can talk to a 

client for another lawyer?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, if the -- if the 

defendant initiates, then the defendant is -- then the 

bar of Jackson doesn't apply. That's the rule, but the 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, again, if that's --

if that's the principle that you're operating on and 

that you'd concede, then I think the Miranda warnings 

would suffice to give all the protection you need.

 MR. VERRILLI: I don't -- apart from the 

question of whether you can reach that result without 

overruling the core holding of Jackson here, it does 

seem to me, with all due respect, we don't agree with 

that because, on the one hand, we do think that free 

choice is preserved in the existing regime and, on the 

other, hand we don't think Miranda can give you all the 

protection you need.

 And I think a good illustration of that is 

this Court's decision in the Moran case. Now, recall in 

Moran, that was an interrogation that occurred before 

the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights had attached, and 

the -- and the police -- and the defendant had a lawyer 

in that case. His sister had hired a lawyer for him. 

The lawyer was trying to reach him. The police kept him 

away, kept the lawyer away from the defendant. The 

Court held that, in the Fifth Amendment context, because 

the Sixth Amendment right had not attached, that the 

Miranda warnings sufficed to guarantee the reliability 

of the confession.

 But the Court was very quick to point out, 

and then reiterated this again in Patterson, that in the

Sixth Amendment context that would be a violation 

because it's an interference with the relationship 

between the defendant and his lawyer, and the ability of 

the defendant to rely on the lawyer. And that's the 

key.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is that, whether or not 

the defendant initiates the contact. I mean, in civil 

matters, it's contrary to the ethics of the bar to 

interrogate the party on the other side when you know he 

has a lawyer, and that would be the case even if he 

initiated it. You wouldn't think of negotiating with 

him without consulting the other lawyer, saying, "Can I 

talk to your client?" So that doesn't stretch over to 

this, to this situation.

 We're not applying bar ethical rules. We're 

applying, supposedly, a rule that determines when a 

confession is coerced. All right? That's what we're 

doing here.

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, what the -- we're 

applying -- the question here is whether defendants in 

this category, the category that Mr. Montejo is in, 

automatic appointment, are entitled to the same Sixth 

Amendment protection as defendants who are in the 

category of -- who are brought to trial in States where 

they -- you have this colloquy as part of the initial

hearing where the defendant is asked.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why couldn't we solve your 

practical problem that we don't know in many States 

whether the defendant accepted appointment or not, by 

simply saying it is not enough to simply accept 

appointment of counsel; you must have requested counsel. 

To merely say, "Oh, that's great, you appointed me 

counsel" --

MR. VERRILLI: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You must have requested it. 

And that would be in accord with the holding of Michigan 

v. Jackson and would solve all of your -- all of your 

practical problems.

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, two things, Your Honor. 

First, it seems to me that what the dispute here is is 

whether there is a principled basis for treating these 

two categories of defendants differently, the defendants 

who are brought to hearings in States where the 

procedures require that they be asked and defendants who 

are brought to hearing in States where they are 

automatically appointed counsel without a showing of 

indigency -- upon a showing of indigency. And I don't 

-- I think with respect to the question of practical 

problems going forward, sure, if all States -- if the 

States in that second category were to conform their

practices such that the defendants were asked and had 

the opportunity to say yes, indeed, I want counsel, then 

I suppose the problem would be solved.  But you really 

get to the same place by holding, as we submit the Court 

really should hold, that when -- when you have an 

automatic appointment, unless there is some reason to 

think the defendant is rejecting it, that Jackson kicks 

in and that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What happens under Michigan 

v. Jackson if I have never requested counsel? I've 

never asked the court to appoint counsel, but I've gone 

out and hired counsel of my own, right?

 MR. VERRILLI: Sure. I think it's quite 

clear that the rule of Michigan against Jackson applies, 

and that's because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it clear from Michigan 

v. Jackson itself, or --

MR. VERRILLI: Well, from cases applying it, 

because in that situation the person is deemed to assert 

the right to counsel by hiring a lawyer, just as by 

asking, and the question here is when you have an 

automatic appointment why should you treat that category 

of defendants any differently for purposes of applying 

the Jackson rule?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Verrilli, do I

understand correctly that the scenario here was the 

defendant, uncounseled, was taken before a judicial 

officer who read him rather standard information, one 

piece of information was, I'm appointing a lawyer for 

you? Was there any opportunity for the defendant to say 

anything at that hearing?

 MR. VERRILLI: And that's the whole problem 

here, Justice Ginsburg. All we have is a one-page 

minute order which reflects that counsel was appointed. 

It doesn't reflect anything about a colloquy because in 

the normal course there's not -- there's no occasion for 

the colloquy. You come in, you get your lawyer, a 

decision about bail is made, and you move on, and the 

next person comes in and that happens.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He didn't get -- he 

didn't in fact get a lawyer. I thought he was told that 

the public defender --

MR. VERRILLI: The Office of Indigent 

Counsel is appointed to represents you.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right, and the actual 

lawyer didn't show up until later.

 MR. VERRILLI: Right. The way the process 

works is -- it's not in the record, but the way the 

process works in this judicial district is there is a 

legal assistant there who takes the names of people who

need lawyers and then immediately -- and the public 

defender service in this district is a contract service. 

They're private attorneys who contract out to do it. 

And then the legal assistant immediately calls, tells 

the lawyers, well, here is who you are representing.

 Now, in a case like this one, which is a 

capital case, there was of course a great sense of 

urgency. There are only two lawyers in this district 

who are qualified to represent capital defendants. They 

got called immediately. Recall what happened here was 

that this hearing took place in the morning and Mr. 

Montejo gets taken back to the jail and very soon after 

he arrives he gets checked back out by these officers 

again and taken out in the squad car where he is kept 

for six hours, and in the meantime essentially while 

he's going out the back door, while he's being taken out 

the back door with the police, his lawyer is coming in 

the front door and raising holy heck about the fact that 

his client's not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the rule 

you're asking for would apply across the board. How 

would it apply in a case where the defendant is given 

Miranda warnings, says, thank you, I don't want to talk 

to my lawyer, I want to talk to you. He's talking to 

the police. All of a sudden they bring a note in and

say: They've appointed a lawyer. The police says: I 

just got a note; you've been appointed a lawyer. Do you 

want to keep talking?

 You would say that's a violation, right? 

And then he says yes and continues to talk.

 MR. VERRILLI: If the police initiated the 

interrogation, yes, because I think it gets to the heart 

of the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a violation, 

even though he knows that if he wanted a lawyer he could 

request one, he knows one's been appointed for him, and 

he's been warned that if he doesn't want to talk without 

a lawyer he doesn't have to, and he's in the middle of a 

conversation that he initiated, and the police says, do 

you want to keep talking? That's a violation?

 MR. VERRILLI: I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice. 

If the defendant initiated the conversation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Early on, before the 

lawyer was appointed, he's given Miranda warnings and he 

says: I want to talk. He's talking. They say: Now, 

we just got the word; a lawyer has been appointed; do 

you want to keep talking? He says yes. That's a 

violation?

 MR. VERRILLI: If the police initiated the 

interrogation, it's a violation.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm trying to 

-- which stage are you talking about, before the lawyer 

was appointed or after? I'm telling you before he was 

appointed, the police did not initiate the conversation. 

They told him he didn't have to talk. He says: I want 

to talk. Now, you're saying it counts as initiating the 

interrogation if they say: You've got a lawyer; do you 

want to keep talking?

 MR. VERRILLI: No, I think that in that 

situation the defendant has initiated and then you've 

got the kind of free choice that the law respects, and 

that's where the line is drawn here. But that is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is he -- where 

is the initiation? Is it when he says, yes, I want to 

keep talking, after being told -- asked do you want to 

keep talking? Or is it way back at the beginning?

 MR. VERRILLI: It's at the outset.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: At the outset.

 MR. VERRILLI: At the outset, it seems to 

me. He has initiated. He exercises free choice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that what 

happened here? He had been given his Miranda warnings, 

right?

 MR. VERRILLI: No, it isn't what happened 

here at all. In fact, it seems to me the opposite, the

opposite thing happened here. For one thing, as a 

factual matter he was told by the police on September 

10th that he didn't have a lawyer, despite the fact that 

one had been appointed for him in the morning. That was 

his testimony.

 Now, I recognize that there is a factual 

issue here that is not resolved, but the Louisiana 

Supreme Court did not discredit that testimony. It 

acknowledged it. What it said was -- and I think this 

points up, Justice Kennedy, what the problem is with 

relying solely on Miranda -- that even in that 

situation, even if it's true that the police officers 

told him on September 10th that he did not have a 

lawyer, that that wouldn't rise to the level of a 

problem that would cause a Fifth Amendment issue under 

Miranda because of the facts of Moran. And it seems to 

me that's exactly the problem there, that that means in 

fact, if we apply Moran that way, that the police could 

deliberately tell him incorrectly that he didn't have a 

lawyer when he did.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But wouldn't that be a 

Miranda problem?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I don't -- well, Moran 

says no.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Miranda.

MR. VERRILLI: Well, Moran says that a 

Miranda waiver is valid despite that kind of deception. 

That's the problem here, it seems to me. It does get to 

the difference. In the Fifth Amendment context, the 

right to have a lawyer there is a prophylactic 

protection against a coerced self-incrimination in the 

setting of custodial interrogation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You think, given Moran, 

that there was no Miranda violation here?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think it would be 

hard, given Moran, to say that there was. And that 

points up the problem. The essence of this right is the 

right to rely on the assistance of counsel at critical 

stages and interrogation is a critical stage.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Verrilli, is it part 

of your assumption that at the time the police were 

doing the interrogating that they knew he had been 

appointed a lawyer?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think that's a bit 

complicated, Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's why I'm interested 

in your comment.

 MR. VERRILLI: But here's my best way to 

work through the facts. Detective Hall, the only 

officer who testified, testified that he was not aware.

The State court credited that and we don't take issue 

with it. The problem is that this is a police precinct 

that has, I don't know, maybe 10, 12 officers in it. 

They have a capital murder suspect in there. He was 

taken by the police to the hearing. The police were 

present at the hearing that morning. He was taken back 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you presume -- do you 

argue that we should presume that the entire police 

force is aware of what happened in court?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think -- I think 

under Jackson, Justice Stevens, they are charged with 

the knowledge. And I think it's important that they 

have to be charged with the knowledge, because otherwise 

there is all kinds of room for manipulation and 

deception. And I do think that's a big part of the 

problem here, that -- and I also think it's important to 

point out as a factual matter the one detective who did 

testify, Detective Hall, testified very carefully. He 

testified that he asked the defendant when he went to 

see him whether he had been contacted by counsel or 

whether his family had gotten him a lawyer, and of 

course neither of those things was true. He was 

indigent, his family hadn't gotten him a lawyer, and he 

hadn't yet been contacted by counsel. He didn't ask

him: Did you have a lawyer appointed for you?

 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Verrilli, do you think 

that Michigan v. Jackson is immune from being reexamined 

at this point?

 MR. VERRILLI: I think it ought not be 

reexamined here, Justice Alito, for several reasons. 

One, the Respondent has not asked for it. Two, there's 

a special justification that has to be shown to overrule 

it, as Dickerson says, in the Miranda context, and this 

is quite parallel.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if we were no longer 

to adhere to that rule on issues of constitutional 

criminal procedure?

 MR. VERRILLI: I think it's quite important 

that the Court do so, and there was a strong consensus 

in Dickerson that the Court do so. I think there's a 

real problem. This is not something that should be done 

lightly based on four pages of discussion in one amicus 

brief. There's a very sharp dividing line in the law 

between the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment 

here, and it applies in numerous areas.

 It's true, for example, with respect to 

lineups. You can have an uncounseled lineup before the 

Sixth Amendment right attaches, you can't after. You 

can have an uncounseled psychiatric examination before

it attaches, you can't after. You can engage in 

surreptitious interrogation of a suspect before the 

Fifth Amendment -- before the Sixth Amendment right 

attaches; you can't after. Certain kinds of 

arraignments have to be done in the presence of counsel.

 So it seems to me you would be destabilizing 

a whole significant area of law without very much 

consideration here were you to say that in this context 

we're going to just say that the Fifth Amendment and the 

Sixth Amendment operate in an equivalent manner.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We wouldn't be saying that. 

We would just be saying that it is unrealistic to think 

that a confession is coerced simply because the police 

initiated the conversation so long as he said: Okay, 

I'll speak without my counsel present. That's all we --

I don't see how it would infect any of these other 

areas. It would just say that's -- that's one bridge 

too far. This is prophylaxis on prophylaxis.

 MR. VERRILLI: You would be overruling 

Jackson in that regard.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true, but not much 

else.

 MR. VERRILLI: And in a case in which it 

seems to me manifestly not appropriate to do so, given 

the lack of consideration given to this by the

Respondent --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a different 

question.

 MR. VERRILLI: And -- well, this is serious 

business. You are going to overrule a precedent that's 

been in place for more than 20 years, that provides a 

very clear bright-line rule for the police to -- to 

manage their affairs with not the slightest showing that 

this rule is presenting any practical problems in its 

administration out there in the field. Nobody has even 

argued that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Mr. Verrilli, you 

have spoken of -- of overruling a bright line, but I 

think there is something else that would be involved in 

the overruling. And I -- I haven't pulled Jackson back 

out since I came on the bench, so this is where you've 

got to help me out.

 There is a -- there is a difference between 

the way you are phrasing the Sixth Amendment right and 

the way, for example, Justice Scalia has phrased it in 

his question. Justice Scalia has phrased it in terms of 

determining what is a coerced confession. You have 

phrased it in your argument in terms of saying a right 

to rely upon counsel, which is a much broader concept.

 Does Jackson support the notion that he

simply has a right to rely upon counsel? I think that 

is your principal argument here because that would be 

the argument that supports your claim that there 

shouldn't be a distinction between a case in which the 

State simply appoints counsel without being asked and a 

case in which he actually asks for counsel. That would 

be a nice way of rationalizing that distinction.

 Isn't it the case that you understand 

Jackson to be a broader rule than a merely no-coercion 

rule? And, number two, if that is so, then overruling 

Jackson would, as I take it, in your view be more than 

simply substituting a -- a one bright-line coercion rule 

for a different bright-line coercion rule. So what are 

your responses to those two questions?

 MR. VERRILLI: That is absolutely correct, 

Justice Souter. The text of the Sixth Amendment 

provides that the -- the accused shall have the right to 

the assistance of counsel. The essence of the right is 

the right to rely on the lawyer at critical stages of 

the proceeding.

 And what Jackson says is that that right 

deserves a very significant measure of protection, and 

we are going to assume that once a defendant asserts it, 

the defendant wants the -- wants the assistance of 

counsel through every critical stage of the proceeding.

JUSTICE SCALIA: You have to assume that his 

voluntary relinquishment of it is somehow coerced. I 

mean there -- there is no way around that. The man has 

said: I know I have counsel, but that's okay; I'll talk 

anyway. And you say: So long as the police have 

initiated that conversation, we will deem it to be 

coerced. You can't get around the coercion aspect of --

of this matter. But that question is whether that is at 

all realistic.

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think -- I think the 

facts of this case make it quite clear that it's a very 

serious risk. Here you have a situation in which a 

defendant who, after all, even before his right attached 

has been subjected to very, very aggressive tactics that 

the Louisiana Supreme Court recognized presented even a 

close case even -- even under the Fifth Amendment.

 Then he -- he finally has a 72-hour hearing. 

He gets a lawyer appointed. As soon as he gets back, 

they take him out in a squad car for six or seven hours, 

at the end of which he produces a -- an apology-letter 

confession written on a pad with a pen given to him by 

the police officers and --

board. In a particular case, as you say, the Louisiana 

Supreme Court said this almost violated his Fifth 

Amendment right. There are protections against the 

actual coercion, which it seems to me you're arguing. 

As I understood Justice Scalia's question, he says: 

Don't you have to assume that there is coercion even in 

the mildest case, not the most extreme one, but the 

mildest one?

 MR. VERRILLI: No, you have -- what you have 

is a right to rely on the assistance of your lawyer, and 

you have -- and -- and it's critical. A good example of 

why it's critical --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A right that you can 

relinquish, a right that you can waive, and all that's 

being suggested is that it is not totally determinative 

whether the police say: Do you want to keep talking, or 

if the defendant says: I want to keep talking.

 MR. VERRILLI: But Jackson drew a clear 

line. It did so because -- and the Court has said -- it 

was a -- a prophylactic rule, but it's a prophylactic 

rule that represents -- reflects the centrality of -- of 

the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, and whether

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- whether or not 

your -- your dialogue with my colleagues about 

overruling Jackson -- putting that to one side, what you 

are arguing is an extension of Jackson from the context 

in which it arose to this context.

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think two -- two 

points on that, Mr. Chief Justice: First, I think it 

would actually break new ground for this Court to hold 

that the defendant who has a lawyer isn't entitled to 

the protection of Jackson. This Court has never held 

that. And every time it has addressed the issue, it 

said the opposite. Admittedly in dictum, but in 

Patterson and Moran it said the opposite. So that is 

what is really breaking new ground, it seems to me.

 And second, the only way to treat these two 

categories of people differently is to come up with a 

principled distinction for why the right should apply 

differently to one than the other, and I submit that 

none has been offered.

 I would like to reserve the balance of my 

time. Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Ms. Landry.

MS. LANDRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The generous prophylactic rule of Michigan 

v. Jackson which imputed a defendant's request for 

counsel in one forum, i.e., his arraignment, to another 

forum of post-attachment custodial interrogation should 

not be expanded in this case to a defendant who has done 

nothing whatsoever to make such a request.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did he have an 

opportunity to do it at the so-called 72-hour hearing? 

Was there any -- did the judicial officer ever ask him 

anything about whether he wanted counsel, whether he 

accepted counsel? Was there any colloquy between them 

at all?

 MS. LANDRY: Not that I'm aware of, Justice 

Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And is that standard 

operating procedure at these 72-hour hearings: That the 

-- the defendant, who is there uncounseled is -- is just 

standing there, and the judicial officer says: I'm 

appointing counsel for you, and he goes on to the next 

thing he's telling him?

 MS. LANDRY: Yes.


 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that how it operates?


 MS. LANDRY: Yes, Your Honor, that is how it

operates.

 But I think one of the fallacies of 

Petitioner's argument is that it leads to the conclusion 

that this defendant had to make that choice at that 

moment at that hearing, and that is not what we have 

asserted either in the Louisiana Supreme Court or at 

this Court.

 Our position is he needs to make a request. 

Whether the request is made in the court proceeding, 

which Jackson said he can make it in the court 

proceeding and it applies thereafter to critical stages, 

which would include custodial interrogation, but in this 

case after they approached him again, there's no request 

at the hearing --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did anybody ever tell him 

he needed to request? I mean, he had just been told by 

a judicial officer: I'm appointing counsel for you. 

He's not counseled at that point. How does he know 

that, in order to protect his right to counsel, he has 

to make some kind of an affirmative assertion? He's 

just been told he's got one.

 MS. LANDRY: Because subsequently, when the 

police approached him, again there being no request 

prior to this that prohibited them from approaching him, 

they provided him with his Miranda rights, which

Patterson says is sufficient in the context of a 

custodial interrogation that takes place 

post-attachment.

 They provided him with his rights, which 

included the right to counsel, and he then waived those 

rights. In fact, this particular defendant on seven 

occasions, three of which -- four of which were 

pre-attachment and three of which were post-attachment, 

was given his rights, including the right to counsel, 

and each of those seven times waived in writing those 

rights.

 Our position is what he needed to do for 

Jackson is make some sort of request or some sort of 

positive assertion that he was asserting his request for 

counsel.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I would have no problem 

at all with the argument you are making if someone had 

told him that he needed to do that. But he didn't have 

a judge to tell him that; he didn't have a lawyer to 

tell him that; and the police certainly didn't tell him 

that.

 MS. LANDRY: No, but when the police did 

approach him after that 72-hour hearing, they advised 

him again of his rights, including his right to counsel, 

and asked him if he wished to waive those rights.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Excuse me. They advised 

him, you say, of his right to counsel. If they gave him 

the standard Miranda warning, what they said was: You 

have the right to have a counsel appointed. They didn't 

say: You have a lawyer who has been appointed. And, in 

fact, his testimony at least is that they told him the 

opposite. But if all they did was give him the Miranda 

warning, they certainly were not informing him of his 

Sixth Amendment right or his Sixth Amendment status.

 MS. LANDRY: I would respectfully disagree, 

Your Honor, because in Patterson the Court said that the 

Miranda rights were sufficient to apprise a defendant of 

his post-attachment Sixth Amendment rights. Did they 

tell him you have a lawyer appointed? No. In fact, 

Detective Hall testified that he was not aware of the 

72-hour hearing or the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's very puzzling. 

This is an experienced police officer. The 72-hour 

hearing is required in every case where defendant is in 

State custody. So how could an experienced police 

officer not know? Somebody, by the way, who knew this 

man had been kept until -- even more than 72 hours. And 

he testifies -- it's true that Detective Hall testified: 

I didn't know that he appointed -- had been appointed a 

lawyer. The very same day that he got to the 72-hour

hearing a day late, how could he not have known?

 MS. LANDRY: I can't answer that question. 

I can only answer the question that all of the officers 

testified that they were not aware that counsel had been 

appointed for the defendant that morning.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course, they know 

-- it's a death case -- that counsel is going to be 

appoint -- or it's a murder case -- that counsel is 

going to be appointed. Everybody knows that except this 

defendant. He doesn't know; of course he doesn't know.

 MS. LANDRY: I understand. They testified 

that they weren't aware that counsel had not been 

appointed that morning.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Just to clarify in my mind. 

Case one, the defendant has no lawyer. He is -- they 

give him Miranda warning. He says: I don't want a 

lawyer. Okay. Now, do you want to speak against 

yourself? Yes, he says, I do. Sorry, strike -- he 

says: No, I don't; I don't want to say anything, but I 

don't want a lawyer.

 Six hours later the policemen say to him: 

Are you really sure that you don't want to speak? He 

says: Well, maybe I will, and he makes a full 

absolutely voluntary decision. That's okay under the 

Constitution, right?

 MS. LANDRY: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's the law. So, the 

law is -- and the reason for that second is because once 

you have a lawyer, police communicate through the 

lawyer. Isn't that the reason, basically? I just 

always thought that was the reason. Once a person has a 

lawyer, another lawyer communicates through the lawyer. 

They don't go and talk to the client. I thought that 

was the kind of rationale for it. Maybe I'm wrong.

wrong. I think that is part of the rationale. What 

Jackson is trying to do was to deter --

JUSTICE BREYER: I was trying to give a 

hypothetical and my hypothetical is a different one than 

you were just told. In my hypothetical the person has a 

lawyer, and I thought where he has a lawyer the police 

are not allowed to go and ask him questions about 

whether he wants to waive. Of course, he can volunteer 

it. Am I right about that?

 MS. LANDRY: Yes, but I also thought that 

your hypothetical included the fact that he told the 

police that he had a lawyer, I retained one yesterday, 

which I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's correct, that's 

correct.

Jackson --

JUSTICE BREYER: Correct, that's the 

conundrum of the case. Now I understand it. The 

conundrum of this case is he didn't tell the police, I 

have a lawyer. He had one.

 Now, if he had hired one and not told the 

police, it would be the same result as we just said, 

wouldn't it? If he had one but didn't tell the police, 

the police could not initiate questioning; am I right or

wrong? All I'm driving at is shouldn't the result here 

be the same?

 MS. LANDRY: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: The same whether you hired 

the lawyer or the same whether the lawyer was appointed? 

At least that's what's in my head. And if you can show 

me that you want the same result in both cases, that 

would go a long way towards convincing me.

 MS. LANDRY: I would disagree with your last 

hypothetical because if a defendant goes out and hires a 

lawyer but never says anything to the police, he makes 

no request, no statement to them regarding the lawyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: He tells some of the 

police. Some of the police know. It just happens that 

these particular ones don't.

 MS. LANDRY: I think if he voices to the 

police some type of positive affirmation -- I have a 

lawyer, I got a lawyer yesterday -- to me that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just interrupt. 

Isn't it perfectly realistic to presume that the police 

knew at the 72-hour hearing he was appointed a lawyer?

 MS. LANDRY: Well, I don't know that you can 

presume that. I mean, you would be overriding the 

testimony of the officers.

percent of the cases, I think, in a capital case. And 

surely, the police should be presumed to know what the 

normal procedure is.

 MS. LANDRY: And in this case, even if you 

presumed that they knew that he had a lawyer, I still 

don't think it overrides the key issue in Jackson as I 

see it, which is his request for counsel, some type of 

affirmation or statement or action to the police that he 

wants to deal through his counsel.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that doesn't go to the 

issue in this case. The issue in this case, as I 

understand it, is not that he lost because he failed to 

make a request. He lost because he failed to make it 

affirmatively clear that he accepted the appointment of 

the lawyer who had, in fact, been appointed for him as 

he had been told. That's not a request.

 As I understand it, under the -- under the 

State court ruling, if he had stood at the 72-hour 

hearing and the court had said, we're appointing the X 

office to defend you, and he had said, great, that would 

have changed the result in this case; isn't that 

correct?

 MS. LANDRY: Yes, I think so.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So the issue is not 

request. The issue is acceptance. That's what it

seems -- just to get my point, that's what seems to me 

to be the acute point of several of the questions you 

have been asked. Why -- we're not talking about 

requests. Why should it make a constitutional 

difference whether the man stands in a Tennessee 

courtroom and simply stands silent when they said, 

you've got a lawyer --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Louisiana.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- as distinct from a case 

where they say you have got a lawyer, and he says, 

that's fine?

 MS. LANDRY: Well, I would disagree with the 

characterization. As I see the case, the question is 

Jackson turned on the fact that that defendant had asked 

for, had requested the help of a lawyer. Patterson said 

so. Patterson said Jackson turned on --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but in this very 

case, if there had been a court reporter present --

present, and if the record showed that this defendant 

said, thank you, I would like to be represented, then he 

would have been protected, right?

 MS. LANDRY: I think he would have under 

Jackson.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Louisiana does not -- does 

not provide a transcript of all these hearings, does it?

MS. LANDRY: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So what would -- what 

should we presume to be the general practice that 

happened, that most of them say, no, I don't want one or 

most of them will say, thank you?

 MS. LANDRY: Well, probably in most cases 

nothing is said. But, again -- and that goes back to my 

earlier point, the police then approached -- I mean, the 

defendant could have said something at the hearing, but 

presuming nothing was said --

JUSTICE STEVENS: He had no -- no way of 

knowing that being silent would produce a different 

result than saying, yes, I'm happy with the lawyer. 

Does the uncounseled defendant have any way to know 

that? Does the routine require the judge to tell him, 

you have got a lawyer, but he's not going to be 

available unless you say you want him?

 MS. LANDRY: No, because I think 

subsequently if he doesn't say anything when the police 

approach him, they tell him he has the right to counsel, 

and at that point he can exercise that right and say, I 

want a lawyer, I don't want to talk to you without a 

lawyer.

understand what you're arguing here. I thought you were

saying there has to be a request in your response to 

Justice Souter, but then you accept as sufficient his 

merely saying thank you. That's not a request.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the Louisiana Supreme 

Court say there has to be a request? I thought they 

said there had to be some action, affirmative act of 

acceptance.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what I thought, too. 

But you were saying there had to be a request. You 

abandon that? There doesn't have to be a request?

be a request --

request.

the State court here. You're asking for a -- in effect, 

a different rule from that which the State court 

applied.

positive affirmation -- and that to me is the whole 

question --

positive affirmation with request for a lawyer?

 MS. LANDRY: Yes. I think there has to be 

some action --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then on your -- then on 

your theory, this individual's Sixth Amendment right 

would not have attached if he had stood in the courtroom 

and said, thank you very much, that's great.

 MS. LANDRY: Well, whether the Sixth 

Amendment right attached I think is a different issue 

from whether the Jackson rule applies to then bar any 

police-initiated conversation with him, and the issue I 

think in this case is whether or not his silence -- the 

Petitioner has argued that the mere appointment of 

counsel with nothing further by this defendant 

constituted the request necessary under Jackson to 

invoke the rule.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: One of my concerns is that 

Jackson is a formality, but you're arguing for a 

formality on top of a formality. I don't know what 

functional purpose is served by your position that he 

has to request the lawyer at the arraignment, especially 

when he's not versed in the law, he's in this stressful 

situation, and you require a formalistic request on the 

part of the defendant? It just makes no sense to me.

requiring a formalized request on the part of the 

defendant at the hearing.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, you're requiring some 

kind of ritualistic phrase to indicate that he -- that 

he accepts the appointment.

 MS. LANDRY: No.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That he requests the 

appointment.

 MS. LANDRY: No, sir. I believe that he can 

remain silent, but later, just as in this case, the 

police approach him; under Patterson they give him his 

rights, which include right to counsel. At that point 

he can request and invoke, and then Jackson becomes 

applicable because he has made a request.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understood you to 

concede that if he had made that request at the 72-hour 

hearing, the outcome of this case would be different.

 MS. LANDRY: Yes, because Jackson says he 

can make the request --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The key time is did he 

make the request at the hearing, not at the time he was 

confronted by the officers.

 MS. LANDRY: I was just saying he can make 

it either time. The fallacy of their argument is that 

he has to make it --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it's sufficient 

protection for him if you presume, as is true in most 

States, that he did make the request, then you would 

lose. You would argue against such a presumption, I 

know, but if we did indulge that presumption, the case 

would be over.

 MS. LANDRY: Clearly I would argue against 

any such presumption; that's the whole reason -- the key 

to Jackson was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, I didn't 

understand you to be doing that. I thought your 

position was once there's a request, there's a request, 

and that's enough.

 MS. LANDRY: Yes, I do.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you're also arguing, it 

seems to me, that a request -- well, you're -- I think 

you're arguing two different things. On the one hand, 

you're arguing that a request is necessary, and yet on 

the other hand, I understood you to concede in answer to 

a question from me that if he had stood in the courtroom 

in Tennessee, having been told that counsel was 

appointed for him and had said, yes, thank you, I accept 

that lawyer, that that would have been sufficient to 

satisfy Jackson, and that would have made the difference 

in this case.

Those are two different positions.

 MS. LANDRY: Well, but I think the question 

boils down to whether or not the latter hypothetical, 

"yes, I want one," whether that is enough to constitute 

the request under Jackson.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, so far as I 

understand it, and you correct me if I'm wrong, but as I 

understand it, what the State Supreme Court said was not 

that he had to make a request, "I want a lawyer," but 

simply that he had to indicate in some way that he 

accepted the appointment of the lawyer which he had been 

told had been appointed for him; and that is a different 

situation from Jackson.

 So if -- if you are saying, yes, if he had 

said "thank you, I accept the lawyer," that would have 

been enough, then that in effect is -- is maintaining 

the position that the State court took; but if you're 

saying something more, that he had to say then or later 

on, "I want a lawyer," then I think you're going beyond 

the case that we have in front of us. Am I wrong?

 MS. LANDRY: No, you're not wrong.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I -- I suppose 

what the dialogue simply establishes is that like in any 

situation there's going to be factual issues about

what's a request or not. I mean, he could say, the 

court says I'm appointing Johnson, and he says, 

"Johnson? Is that the best you can do?" And the 

question is, is that accepting Johnson or not? He says 

is that the best you can do? Maybe it is, maybe it's 

not. I mean, but the point is whether or not you 

establish a rule that requires some request, and in the 

odd case there will be a debate about what's a request 

or not, but the issue is the general rule.

 MS. LANDRY: Yes, Your Honor, that's 

correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't -- I don't --

I agree with Justice Souter. I -- acceptance is 

something different from a request. As I read the --

the State court's opinion, it was setting up a sort of 

offer and acceptance scenario. The State was offering 

him counsel, said, "I appoint counsel," but it was 

ineffective until he says yes, "I accept counsel," 

whereupon, you know, he's lawyered up, but he isn't 

lawyered up until he says "I accept," and that's 

something quite different from -- from requesting 

counsel.

 MS. LANDRY: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, are you -- are you 

standing on the -- on the State court's analysis or not?

MS. LANDRY: Yes, Your Honor, and I think 

the State court analysis comes from -- well, it came 

from the Fifth Circuit case of Montoya which was very 

similar factually, and the Fifth Circuit relied on the 

Court's opinion in Patterson, and I believe cited a 

footnote from Patterson that refers to, you know, 

affirmative acceptance of the appointment of counsel.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But this is still an 

artificial framework, because we know that in this case 

he has to have a lawyer under Gideon unless he waives it 

after being fully advised. You couldn't rely just on --

on the failure to make a request not to proceed with a 

trial lawyer. Of course he's going to have a lawyer 

unless after he very, very careful colloquy from the 

district judge or the trial judge, declines.

 So it seems to me that this -- this whole 

framework here is quite artificial. Now, I do think 

there's a Miranda problem here, if we accept his -- the 

defendant's testimony that the police told him, "oh no, 

you don't have a lawyer." I know there's a factual 

issue on that. And I -- I think the counsel for the 

Petitioner may not be quite correct in Moran v Burbine. 

I didn't have time to talk with him about that. There 

there was no misleading; they just didn't tell him that 

he had a lawyer. Here, assuming his version of the

facts is correct, they told him, "oh, no, you don't have 

a lawyer," they affirmatively misled him, and it seems 

to me that's a Miranda problem, if it's true, and that 

Miranda is completely sufficient to protect his rights.

 MS. LANDRY: But also, if I can address that 

factual issue, because I think it is important in the 

context here, because the question presented to this 

Court, the assignment of error at the Louisiana Supreme 

Court was only premised on the fact that counsel was 

appointed.

 There was never any argument -- they bring 

up the factual issues about, well, the defendant 

testified at trial that he told them he had a lawyer, 

and the officers testified he didn't, to make it appear 

there's a factual issue there; but if you look back at 

the proceedings in this case, the motion to suppress, 

which is at the Joint Appendix page 6, never alleged any 

of those issues. It only alleged that his statements 

were not free and voluntary.

 Then the suppression hearing comes. Now, 

most of the effort at the suppression hearing was toward 

the videotape which is not at issue here, but the 

argument by the defendant's counsel on this issue was 

merely what exactly it is here, that the mere 

appointment of counsel was sufficient to trigger

Jackson, and therefore everything after that should not 

have been admitted.

 There was never any testimony at the 

suppression hearing by the defendant or anyone else that 

he had been -- that he told the officers, "I've been 

appointed counsel," "I think I've been appointed 

counsel," "I think I might have a lawyer."

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's just that everything 

after -- as far as I understand, the only piece of 

evidence we're talking about is his condolence letter to 

the widow which amounted to a confession of guilt.

 MS. LANDRY: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is no other. 

Because all of the Mirandized free 72-hour hearing, all 

that is not in contest; all of that came in.

 MS. LANDRY: That's correct, it's just 

the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask -- I'm getting a 

different idea from what you're arguing. I want to try 

it on you and see what your response is. It's simply 

this, that there's something backwards about this case, 

and what's backwards is this, that when they're talking 

about a prophylactic rule in Jackson, what they're 

thinking of is the following: Everyone agrees that when 

a person really has a counsel, at that point, unlike the

Miranda point, the police cannot talk to him further, 

though he can initiate.

 Now, everyone agreeing, what do we do with a 

case where a person doesn't have a lawyer, but he 

requests one? Now, in such a circumstance, we're going 

to treat it as if he had one. That's the prophylactic 

part. But here's a case where he really has one. So it 

doesn't fall outside Jackson. It falls within the basic 

assumption of Jackson, that the difference between 

having a lawyer and not having a lawyer is, if you have 

a lawyer, the police can initiate nothing. You can't 

talk to him.

 Now, if that's right, your case -- I mean, 

I'm afraid, their side, for your point of view, is a 

fortiori for Jackson, not the borderline of Jackson. 

Now, explain to me why I've got it wrong.

 MS. LANDRY: Because, in our case and in the 

case where there's just counsel appointed, again I go 

back to the issue, there's no request; there's no 

positive action by the defendant constituting a request 

in indicating that he's requesting a lawyer, which was 

the basis of the ruling in Jackson. It was -- and 

Patterson later said, Jackson turned on the fact that 

that defendant had asked for a lawyer.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't the prophylactic

aspect of Jackson not what Justice Breyer just said, but 

the rule that a person who has a lawyer is thereafter 

incapable of waiving the assistance of the lawyer if the 

person wishes to speak with the police and the police 

happen to initiate the conversation? You could have a 

defendant who's the most experienced criminal defense 

attorney in the world, who knows everything there is to 

know about trial tactics, who has a lawyer and decides 

it's in my best interest now to speak to the police. 

They happen to initiate it. But Jackson has a 

prophylactic rule that says even in that situation, it 

can't be done. That's the prophylactic aspect of 

Jackson, isn't it?

 MS. LANDRY: Well, I would disagree --

JUSTICE BREYER: Accept that, for argument's 

sake. Accept that, and then same -- same question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, why don't 

you answer Justice Alito's question?

 MS. LANDRY: I was going to say that I 

disagree to the -- to the extent that I think part of 

the basis of Jackson was wanting to deter police from 

badgering a defendant into waiving a right that he had 

already asserted. That was the crux, it seemed to me, 

of Jackson, that this defendant had asserted his right 

to counsel at the arraignment. They then approached him

later. And the Court found that that was a form of 

police badgering to then approach him after he had made 

the request for counsel. And I believe that that's one 

of the differentiations in this case, where we talk 

about whether there's a request for counsel.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Interesting. I think this 

is very interesting to me because I'm learning a lot. 

Suppose -- Let's assume Justice Alito is absolutely 

right and that when you have a counsel, that's what 

you've done and that's the reason why you don't talk to 

the police, or at least they can't initiate. Fine. 

Take that as the rationale, and now apply it to this 

case. Since he has a lawyer, whether he said yes, no, 

maybe, "I accept" or not, it would have nothing to do 

with it. The same rationale would apply or would it?

 MS. LANDRY: No, I don't think it would.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Because?

 MS. LANDRY: Because, again, the appointment 

of counsel, as in this case, was an action taken by the 

State. There was no action by this defendant asserting 

or requesting counsel. This was a State action: We're 

appointing counsel for you. It's a pro forma thing that 

goes on, and then subsequently they go through the 

paperwork to determine whether he's qualified --

JUSTICE BREYER: I see.

MS. LANDRY: -- to receive indigent counsel.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you: If the 

case had gone to trial without any intermediate 

proceeding -- they just show up for the day of trial --

and there's no record of whether he accepted the lawyer 

earlier, would the State judge start out with the 

presumption that Faretta would apply and he's going on 

his own, or would they start out with the assumption 

that he is going to have a lawyer?

 MS. LANDRY: No, Your Honor, because, 

obviously, just as Patterson discussed, the waiver issue 

is much different when you're talking about a defendant 

proceeding through a legal proceeding representing 

himself than it is in the context here.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So you're drawing a 

distinction between this -- the kind of proceeding 

that's involved? He doesn't really need help on 

deciding whether to confess, but he does need help if 

they go to trial?

 MS. LANDRY: Well, it's not that he doesn't 

need help, but he's advised of his right to counsel and 

can voluntarily choose, exercise his own free will, 

whether he wants counsel or not.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: There's an irony in this 

case that Justice Kennedy put a finger on earlier: If

there were a civil case, whether you could go talk to a 

lawyer -- a client, rather, who was represented by a 

lawyer, the answer would be quite clear: You could not, 

as a matter of professional ethics.

 MS. LANDRY: Right, and I think that that's 

true of the --

JUSTICE STEVEN: And the Constitution gives 

less protection than the -- than the professional ethics 

does.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the usual legal 

rule is that silence implies consent, right? Read the 

prosecution of Thomas More. That's the legal rule. So 

why shouldn't we assume consent just from the fact that 

he stood silent?

 MS. LANDRY: Because, again, in Jackson, the 

assertion or the request for counsel is what implies to 

the police that this defendant does not want to deal 

with the police on his own, that he wishes to only 

communicate through counsel. And the Sixth Amendment 

right that attached and his right to counsel is just 

that: It's a right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Landry, you're trying 

to explain your position, let's assume, to an 

intelligent layperson, and the first example is, in many 

States at the equivalent of the 72-hour hearing, the

defendant is told: The court is prepared to appoint a 

lawyer for you. Would you like us to appoint a lawyer? 

And the defendant will say yes. So he will have made 

the request for a lawyer. And then there are States 

like Louisiana where this is a rapid-fire proceeding, 

and the defendant isn't asked any questions, he isn't 

asked to agree or disagree, and he doesn't have any 

lawyer there to assist him.

 So you are essentially asking the Court to 

make a distinction between defendants in the same 

position, both uncounseled, both not knowledgeable in 

the law, but the one who has the good fortune to be in a 

State where the judge tells the defendant, "You have a 

right to have a lawyer. Would you like me to appoint 

one?" And then this procedure. Shouldn't defendant's 

rights turn on that distinction in the State law?

 MS. LANDRY: Yes, because the police then 

approach him under Patterson, give him his rights, which 

includes the right to counsel. He has every right to 

then exercise his free will, if he didn't do so at the 

hearing, and invoke his right to counsel.

 A couple points of clarification, if I 

might: Counsel for Respondent has made the suggestion 

that the only facts that are before you are the facts 

that were in the suppression hearing, rather than the 

facts that were subsequently adduced at trial when Mr. 

Montejo testified that he told them he didn't want to go 

with them and he thought he had a lawyer and was told he 

didn't. That's not correct as a matter of Louisiana 

law. The citation there is State v. Green, 655 Southern 

2d 272, where it's quite clear as a matter of Louisiana 

law that the supreme court evaluates the entire record. 

It's not clear as a matter of federal law. That was one 

of the holdings of Arizona against Fulminante. Now, we 

cited that case for harmless error purposes, not this 

purpose, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Verrilli --

MR. VERRILLI: -- but quite clear --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you just struck two 

chords: One, harmless error; the other, that this 

defendant testified at his trial. We have held that a 

defendant's statements, although he wasn't given his 

Jackson right, can come in by way of impeachment if he

testifies. So in this defendant's case, even if we 

accept everything you say, the -- that condolence letter 

could have been used for impeachment purposes.

 MR. VERRILLI: Yes. We don't contest that, 

Justice Ginsburg. Of course, it wasn't used for 

impeachment purposes; it was used in fact as substantive 

evidence, and there was no limiting instruction to let 

the jury know that it could only be considered for that 

limited purpose. And I don't think that suffices even 

remotely to overcome the harmless error problem here.

 The second point of clarification, it does 

seem to me clear, both from pages 14 and 15 of 

Respondent's brief and Respondent's argument here today 

and in particular the citation to the Montoya case in 

the Fifth Circuit, they are not advocating a request 

rule; they are advocating a request or assertion rule. 

In fact, the very passage in Montoya to which 

Respondent's counsel adverts -- it says there doesn't 

have to be a request so long as there is an assertion.

 And that's the principle they're advocating. 

It just doesn't make any sense as a sensible dividing 

line between categories of defendants who are protected 

by Jackson and those who aren't for the reasons that we 

have discussed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Verrilli, I don't

understand your response to Justice Ginsburg. I mean, 

it seems to me, if this thing was going to come in 

anyway, how could you possibly say it was harmful and 

not harmless error?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, it would come --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What difference does it 

make whether it's introduced in the case in chief or 

whether it's introduced to refute the defendant's 

assertion that he didn't do it?

 MR. VERRILLI: Well, if it's introduced in 

the case in chief, it's substantive evidence on which 

the prosecution relied or can rely to establish the 

case. It's very much like Fulminante in that regard. 

There were two confessions, one admissible, the other 

inadmissible. And it was the self-reinforcing character 

of the two that made it not a harmless error for 

Fulminante. We really have the same thing.

 But, if I could, I would like to get back, 

Justice Kennedy, to the Moran case. I do think, with 

all due respect, there was an element of deception in 

Moran that was sanctioned as consistent with Miranda. 

Two things happened there: The police informed Moran's 

lawyer that they -- incorrectly, falsely -- that they 

weren't going to interrogate him, but they also failed 

to inform Moran that he had a lawyer, and the lawyer was

standing out there. And that's fully as much of a 

deception as telling somebody he doesn't have a lawyer 

when he does, or withholding information that made a big 

difference for Sixth Amendment purposes, which is why 

the Court in Moran drew that line very sharply and said, 

for Fifth Amendment purposes, the Sixth Amendment right 

hasn't attached, there isn't an interference with the 

attorney-client relationship, but the very same thing 

would be forbidden under the Sixth Amendment.

 And Patterson says exactly the same thing. 

In Patterson, again -- just to conclude, Justice Breyer 

-- drew the line exactly where Your Honor's hypothetical 

drew it. What Patterson says is that, if a defendant 

does not have a lawyer, we operate one way; when a 

defendant has a lawyer, a different set of rules kick 

in. And then, it says, indeed the different rules kick 

in even if a defendant requests a lawyer, making clear 

that the point of extending to request was to put 

defendants who have asked for lawyers but don't have 

them yet in the same position as defendants who have 

lawyers, not to give them a superior Sixth Amendment 

protection.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

Verrilli.
