 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-289, Horne v. Flores and the 

consolidated case.

 Mr. Starr.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. STARR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In January of 2000 the district court in 

Arizona concluded that the Nogales school system had 

failed to provide an equal educational opportunity for 

its English language learners in that particular 

district.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I thought the 

determination was that it had failed to provide funds 

that could reasonably accomplish the -- the -- the plan 

which the district itself had adopted.

 MR. STARR: Well, Your Honor, the specific 

finding was that there needed to be -- there were very 

elaborate findings here. There needed in fact to be 

remediation to in fact support a plan, and the State --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But the district agreed on 

that, I take it. The district said, you've got to do

something. This is our plan.

 And I thought the district court then 

said -- the school district did that, and I thought the 

district court then said, well, the -- the funding that 

you have come up with, or the funding scheme you have 

come up with simply is not rationally related to the 

plan that you, yourself, have adopted. Am I -- am I 

wrong on that?

 MR. STARR: You are correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. STARR: It needs to be a rational plan. 

But then by the time of the 60(b) hearing, the 

circumstances had dramatically changed. There had been 

a failure. But in November of 2000, a sea change 

occurred in educational policy. The old system in 

Nogales was done away with throughout the State. 

Strategic English Immersion, intense immersion, and the 

results are already being shown. Nogales --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the year, Mr. 

Starr, the year of that change to the SEI from the 

bilingual education? What was the year of that?

 MR. STARR: The voters voted it in, in 

November of 2000, and it began feathering in very 

promptly as soon as the school districts could in fact 

respond, and Nogales --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And yet the district 

court kept renewing his instruction, provide funding 

that reasonably relates to the cost, many, many times 

after the SEI became effective. And we -- we have the 

original decree which was, what, a declaratory judgment 

in 2000. Then he issues a series of order. None -- and 

none of them are ever appealed.

 MR. STARR: That is true. And in fact one 

of the grounds of our submission this morning is that 

the failure to appeal should be in fact a cause for 

concern. Indeed, 60(b)(5) is all about exceptions to 

finality, especially when we are dealing with a very 

quintessential State and local function, namely, 

education.

 And, thus, the court should have been open 

to consider what the Ninth Circuit had commanded it 

consider, namely the changed circumstances. And what 

were those changed circumstances? Nogales was doing 

great. A new leadership came in. Superintendent Cooper 

made tremendous reforms. The State responded, not only 

with a new methodology, but by funding that methodology. 

And, Your Honor, all of this --

JUSTICE BREYER: Nogales was doing great? I 

mean, I asked my clerk to go get some figures out of the 

record and she says in 2008 in the sixth grade, just to

take an example, 77 percent of the English learners in 

Nogales failed the tests as compared to 32 percent 

statewide. In the tenth grade 84 percent failed the 

reading exam compared with 34 percent statewide. In 

2008 the reading exam fourth graders, 67 percent failed 

in Nogales, the English learners, compared to 30 percent 

statewide.

 Now, I'm sure that progress has been made, 

but it doesn't seem to me, looking at that kind of thing 

-- and the record is filled with that kind of thing --

that that -- that you could say that the objectives are 

achieved.

 MR. STARR: Your Honor, first of all, the 

exam to which you are referring is given in English. If 

I am taking German, then I am not going to do well in a 

German --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, isn't the point of 

this to teach the children to learn English?

 MR. STARR: But the point is the -- the exam 

that you should look at is the AZELA exam.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I am not 

following this exchange because I don't understand 

whether the -- the statewide percentage is the statewide 

percentage of English learners or the statewide 

percentage of all students.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If you can't answer that, I 

think Justice Breyer can. But I would like to know what 

comparison --

JUSTICE BREYER: He doesn't actually have 

the right to ask me questions.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't. That's -- that's 

exactly true. But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Very much true. 

Counsel, why don't you try and answer?

 MR. STARR: Thank you.

 I would go, if I would -- if you would, to 

page 46a of our Pet. Ap, where you -- Petition Appendix, 

where you, in fact, get the information summarized, and 

then go to -- and this is the Ninth Circuit's own words 

that "Nogales is doing substantially better," "the State 

has developed a significantly improved infrastructure."

 And then if you go to the superintendent's 

Petition Appendix, you will see -- this is the relevant 

information under No Child Left Behind, which is one of 

the changed circumstances -- the Nogales students are, 

in fact, doing better than across the State. The key is 

to measure the progress that has, in fact, been made and

that is not disputed. Everyone agrees.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I still don't 

have an answer to Justice Breyer's -- I guess 

Justice Scalia's question following up on Justice 

Breyer's. What are the parameters or the -- the data 

with respect to the figures Justice Breyer gave you?

 MR. STARR: Yes. The key, I would refer the 

Court to Appendix 312 of the superintendent's petition 

and the prior pages. And that gives the percentage of 

students making progress under the exams that are 

administered by the State statewide, and that you will 

see that throughout, including in the high school, that 

the students are, in fact, making progress. The 

district court concluded that Nogales had --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the answer is 

that Justice Breyer's figures are correct with respect 

to the appropriate bases of children. You are just 

saying that you want to use a different test than the 

one that he was quoting?

 MR. STARR: Well, again, my quarrel with his 

figures had to do with the nature of the test being 

exam. There are different tests being administered.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. The figures 

are accurate. You just think a different test should be 

used?

MR. STARR: That one shouldn't take too 

seriously a test that is --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Let's take the 

one you mentioned. Let's take the one you mention. The 

one you mentioned, I take it the student academic 

achievement in mathematics, which is something called 

the AYP guidelines test, they are for high school, which 

you mentioned. It has -- I think it's 2008, maybe it's 

2007 -- we have limited English proficient students, 

this is passing their test, 22.4 percent of the English 

learners are at students scoring at or above proficient. 

The overall rate is 68 percent. So it seems like about 

a third.

 Now, if you look at the reading language 

arts, the average is 73.5. Limited English proficient 

is 15.4. And that's quite a difference, 75 percent as 

to 15.4, in the high schools, on the tests that you have 

mentioned.

 So I just say -- my only point is that we 

have a couple of findings here; you are right, they have 

made progress, but they are not quite home yet. And I 

would say that, looking at this record, it seems to 

suggest that.

 MR. STARR: But not home yet, Your Honor, 

is, in fact, the key question. What is home? And that

brings us to --

JUSTICE BREYER: Let's do another one. What 

they started out in the year 2000 is they said one 

problem with this State is we don't know what it costs 

the average -- the increased program. They haven't done 

a good study to tell what it costs.  But we think it's 

somewhere around $1500, maybe it's $1300, maybe it's 

$1400 per student. And as of this very moment, the 

State is providing 3 to $400, leaving it up to the 

school district to find the rest of the money, which it 

has to take from other things like English, or -- is 

that right?

 MR. STARR: No, that is incorrect, Your 

Honor. First of all, there has been a substantial 

increase in funding, which we supply and summarize at 

pages 22 and 23 of the opening brief. And you will see 

throughout the testimony -- the testimony is absolutely 

clear, including the plaintiffs', the Respondents', key 

witness, Dr. Zumudio, agreed that there has, in fact, 

been substantial progress, indeed there is an effective 

program in place.

 And so our fundamental quarrel with the 

approach of the district court is it blinded itself to 

the significant changes structurally as well as the 

progress that had been made and just said it doesn't

matter because this is all about funding, and that is 

not true.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Starr, can I take you 

back to the beginning of the 60(b) motion, because you 

seem to have shifted ground? The 60(b) motion as 

presented to the district court said that this new law 

passed by the Arizona legislature, 2064 -- "2064 creates 

a plan for adequate funding of programs for the ELL 

students."

 That was the whole basis for the 60(b) 

motion, whether the new law was supplied adequate 

funding, and the Speaker of the House and the Senate 

intervened specifically for the purpose of defending the 

new law. Your current argument is detached from the new 

law.

 MR. STARR: It is not detached, but our 

submission is, in fact, that we look to what the 

district court had before it in the 60(b)(5) hearing. 

It had an eight-day evidentiary hearing. It was not 

simply legal argument over that particular bill. And 

that evidence --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was the basis 

for the 64(b) motion, that 2064 provided adequate 

funding.

 MR. STARR: Your Honor, there were a variety

of points made, and the 60(b) submission was not limited 

to this new bill. Rather, it was a totality of the 

circumstances, here are the changed circumstances. 

That's what the whole eight-day trial was about. The 

eight-day trial was about what are the new funding 

mechanisms, what is happening on the ground in Nogales. 

And as I say, even the Respondents' own key witness said 

that there is an effective ELL program now in place, and 

that, in fact, progress --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we -- do we have 

the -- the intervention application in the papers before 

us and the 60(b) motion?

 MR. STARR: Yes, you do -- you do have it 

before you. And there is no question that the Speaker 

and the President were, in fact, submitting to the 

district court HB 2064 as part of the submission.

 My point is the evidentiary hearing went 

much more broadly and here's the key: Under the EEOA, 

all that is required under the Castaneda framework is, 

in fact, good faith efforts toward compliance. The 

questions that are flowing suggest there has been no 

good faith effort at compliance, and there has been. 

That's what the eight-day hearing was all about. That's 

one of the things that Superintendent Cooper testified 

to and discredited.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I -- help me out 

then. I thought the -- the issue was not whether there 

had been any good faith attempt at compliance, but 

whether there were two deficiencies under the scheme, 

under the -- I forget the statute -- the new bill. One 

deficiency was that it limited the funding for any given 

student subject to -- to ELL -- to two-year funding 

when, in fact, the evidence showed that you couldn't get 

a kid up to par with two years of education.

 The second deficiency was that the -- that 

the State funds -- strike that, I'm sorry -- that 

Federal funds were being used to supplant what should 

have been a State responsibility rather than merely 

supplementing. I take it that is simply a matter of 

degree, but that was the problem.

 I thought those were the two problems, 

two-year funding, supplantation. Am I -- am I wrong? 

So there was no -- my point is that there was no denial 

that some good faith efforts had been made. The finding 

was that there were two deficiencies and these were the 

two deficiencies; is that correct?

 MR. STARR: As -- that is correct. But as 

to the latter with respect to the Federal funds, 

supplant versus supplement, all that we have is -- and 

this is an issue that is entrusted to the Department of

Education. It's not trusted to the district courts 

under No Child Left Behind. This is an apparatus that 

Congress has determined there should no longer be -- not 

that EEOA doesn't -- it has its beachhead, it has its 

place, but now No Child Left Behind has a very elaborate 

process including a plan, and Arizona is in compliance 

with that plan.

 The point is the HB 2064 points completely 

blinded the district court to what was actually before 

him, and we think that that is wrong.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Starr, how do you 

explain the fact the State of Arizona and the board of 

education are troubled by the same two points?

 MR. STARR: There is no question that there 

is disagreement within the house with respect to that. 

But, Your Honor, there is no authority on the part of a 

Federal court under No Child Left Behind to render this 

kind of interpretation. And it has blinded us --

ultimately, it is irrelevant. It has blinded us to the 

issue --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what is it -- No 

Child Left Behind I thought has a specific saving 

clause, "Nothing in this part shall be construed in a 

manner inconsistent with any Federal law guaranteeing a 

civil right." And the EEOA is such a law.

MR. STARR: That is correct. The point that 

I am making is the interpretation of supplemental versus 

supplant is in fact one that is entrusted to the 

Department of Education. We only have a letter. That's 

not final agency action. But I want to return to what 

we think is the key in a 60(b)(5) hearing.

 What is key in 60(b)(5) is to listen to the 

changed circumstances. What are the changed 

circumstances? And the Court blinded itself to these 

very important changes in terms of State funding --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is the one State 

funding? Because I looked at your brief, page 22 to 23, 

and if I understand it correctly it says that the 

educational expenditures, that is to say monies, 

increased in this Nogales and USD --

MR. STARR: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- maintenance and 

operation budget, by 30 percent. Well, I'm sure they 

did. But that's I take it the entire maintenance and 

operation budget. The numbers I had -- and I am quite 

interested to know if they are wrong -- the numbers that 

I have is that the only survey they've done across the 

State, or the most recent one, says that the English 

language instructional costs range between 1570 and 

$3300 per pupil. And then if you look at the amount the

State provides outside of the reading, writing and 

arithmetic, which they provide, et cetera, for all 

students, what they provide is -- currently it's $340, 

and if that law had gone into effect, 2064, it would 

have been $450. Now, are those numbers totally wrong?

 MR. STARR: The numbers are not wrong, Your 

Honor, but the numbers are in fact not the pivotal 

point. The EEOA is not a funding statute, and let me 

come to the specific point of cost studies. The State 

of Arizona did in fact seek to undertake a statewide 

cost study. And our -- one of our fundamental problems 

here is this case is no longer about Nogales. It has 

been expanded. Even though it was a class action 

limited to Nogales, it has been expanded to include an 

intrusion into the prerogatives of the State.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the fault of the 

Arizona attorney general, who told the court: You 

cannot deal with Nogales alone because under the Arizona 

Constitution the -- all -- all the school districts have 

to be treated equally. So, it wasn't the plaintiffs 

that initiated that move to make it statewide; it was in 

fact the Arizona attorney general.

 MR. STARR: And we are now seeking relief 

from that, because what we now know --

state law changed?

 MR. STARR: What has changed --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, the reason -- the 

reason for getting into this is that the State required 

it. Has the State law changed?

 MR. STARR: The State law does not require 

specific earmarked funding, district by district, and 

here's the key --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume it's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, we are not talking 

about -- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I also assume the State law 

does not require that any -- any judicial decree with 

respect to a particular district be expanded to the 

whole State. It seems to me you could comply with the 

State Constitution. If and when a judgment is rendered 

as to the district, it would then be, under the State 

Constitution, the responsibility of the State executive 

to make sure that the other -- other districts are 

equalized.

 But why the attorney general had to come 

into the Federal court and say, do it to the whole 

State, because the whole State has to be equal, I -- I 

can't understand that, to tell you the truth.

 MR. STARR: It's why the district

court should have been on guard --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What is the district court 

supposed to do? The attorney general for the State 

comes in and says, do it this way. It seems to me that 

the State has no standing later on to say: Oh, gee, the 

district court should have said: Sorry, Mr. Attorney 

General; you don't know anything about your State law; 

we won't do it this way.

 MR. STARR: Your Honor, we are not trying to 

relitigate the original judgment. We quarrel with it, 

but that's not why we're here. We're here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The fact is he wanted to be 

thrown into the briar patch, didn't he?

 MR. STARR: It was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The State attorney general 

wanted the decree.

 MR. STARR: There is -- there is no question 

that there was a division of the opinion within the 

State and that in fact the attorney general was 

essentially siding with the plaintiffs in their 

litigation. There is now a very different perspective 

and you have that before you, that the governor who 

controls the litigation in the State is the chief 

executive of the State in terms of determining what the 

State's position is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you tell me what 

your submission is with respect to the error you see in 

the findings and the order made after the eight-day 

hearing? First, are you saying that after No Child Left 

Behind that the duty of the State with respect to 

educating the students who have a different language was 

less onerous?

 MR. STARR: No, it's not less onerous, but 

there is a different methodology and a different 

approach.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. And are you 

saying that because of that methodology any remedy based 

on funding is no longer appropriate?

 MR. STARR: A funding remedy is in fact 

inappropriate presumptively statewide. That is our key 

submission, because of the variation in costs, district 

by district.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we could -- is it valid 

as to Nogales, if we focus just on Nogales?

 MR. STARR: Not in terms of changed 

circumstances, because of what has in fact happened on 

the ground. Namely, one of the thing when we go back to 

the original order --

saying that the order the district court gave with 

respect just to Nogales --

MR. STARR: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- is inappropriate 

because it used a funding remedy or a funding measure of 

compliance when it should have used blank, and then fill 

in the blank?

 MR. STARR: Yes. It should have simply 

determined under Castaneda the three-part test. It 

should not have said the EEOA requires a particular 

level of funding. That's precisely what Castaneda --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that isn't what it -- I 

don't understand that it has ever said that. I thought 

the funding point was basically this: You, Nogales, 

have come up with plan A. You have come up with funding 

B. Funding B is not enough money to fund plan A. It is 

your plan, you've got to fund your plan.

 That is not saying that the Federal statute 

requires a particular level of funding. It's not saying 

that the district court can take over the responsibility 

of deciding what is appropriate funding in a school 

district. It's simply saying, "If you choose plan A, 

you have got to pay for plan A."

ever go beyond that?

 MR. STARR: It did go beyond that in this 

sense. It did not in fact determine whether in fact 

there was an effective program in place. That's the 

oddity about this case --

JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, it should 

have said: Before I decide whether your funding for 

plan A is good enough, I have got to decide whether plan 

A itself is worth anything?  I mean, I have got to 

evaluate plan A?

 MR. STARR: No. The difficulty is seeking 

to enforce a specific funding order, and particularly 

statewide, which intrudes --

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Let's go back 

to Justice Kennedy's point a moment ago. Let's just 

talk about Nogales for a minute. With respect to plan 

A, that was Nogales' plan. And the district court said: 

You can't fund that plan with the amount of money that 

you have appropriated. Did the district court go beyond 

that with respect to Nogales?

 MR. STARR: The district court failed to 

note that plan A had changed. There was no longer a 

plan A. It was strategic English immersion which has an 

entirely different methodology. And what it also --

and this case was going on for, what, eight, nine years 

before there was ever an argument. I mean in all of 

these orders that were not appealed, don't those 

judgments, unappealed judgments, settle anything?

 MR. STARR: Of -- of course. They let that 

judgment stand during that period of time. But the 

whole purpose of 60(b)(5) is relief from finality. It's 

a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but didn't -- didn't 

the court -- you say plan A is no longer in effect; they 

have a new plan under the No Child Left Behind Act. But 

didn't the -- didn't the district court find that the 

funding for that plan is inadequate, for the two reasons 

that were mentioned earlier?

 MR. STARR: Well, it said that -- here is 

what the court held: That it has developed a 

significantly improved infrastructure for ELL 

programming, but it has not complied with the original 

judgment. That is our complaint. The original funding 

judgment was in fact informed by a different methodology 

and a different set of circumstances. For example, 

Superintendent Cooper comes in and says: I don't want 

to spend money on teachers' aides; they are standing in 

the way. Yet the Respondents say: We need money for 

teachers' aides. That's part of No Child Left Behind.

Inputs -- now we look at -- we test, we 

determine what progress is being made and, we are 

requiring progress to be made.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't think there was 

in the district judge's declaratory judgment, spend this 

much on teachers aides, that much on the other. It was: 

You need a plan and you have to figure out how much it 

costs, and then you have to appropriate money that 

matches the cost.

 But the district court -- I may be wrong 

about this, but I thought that the original declaratory 

judgment didn't try to tell them what the components of 

that plan had to be.

 MR. STARR: You are precisely right, but the 

point I'm making is that the objects of that underlying 

decree shifted by virtue of the new methodology that was 

in fact adequately funded through a whole variety of 

funds. The funds that Justice Breyer has referred to 

are only part of the basket of funds that have been made 

available.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No. But doesn't it --

doesn't it -- don't we come back to Justice Scalia's 

question of a moment ago? Even with the -- the changed 

plan to immersion, isn't the finding that two years of 

funding per child is not enough? And you are

supplanting, not supplementing. Isn't that still the 

problem?

 MR. STARR: We believe not. We believe that 

ultimately those two issues are irrelevant to the issue 

that is before the Court.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But those are the issues 

that the court focused on; are they not?

 MR. STARR: Wrongly, because that's --

that's part of our quarrel, THAT the district court 

simply focused on these two elements of HB 2064, and 

blinded itself to the evidence --

JUSTICE BREYER: There is a minor thing that 

I -- I think -- I'm not sure that Justice Ginsburg said. 

I thought that the funding order was not fund the plan 

you come up with; but rather, come up with a funding 

plan that bears a rational relationship to -- to the 

plan you come up with. So is that right?

 MR. STARR: That is correct, and that is --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And now the 

district court is at considerable remove. He says they 

have not yet come up with a study and a plan that seems 

satisfactory, and they haven't shown how the funding is 

rational in relation to the plan that they haven't fully 

developed, though they've made progress. That's where 

we are -- is that where we are?

MR. STARR: Three brief points. On the 

study, the State did undertake a study, and this is in 

the record. And the National Conference of State 

Legislators said: We throw up our hands because we 

can't do this statewide. I would invite the Court to 

refocus on Nogales as a district versus statewide.

 What was entered here in this order, which 

makes it so extraordinary, is that the entire State 

funding mechanism has been interfered with by the order. 

This case started out in Nogales. And so the statewide 

study was in fact undertaken. But we could not do it. 

The National Conference of State Legislatures said: We 

throw up our hands. We can do a local study, and it was 

done. And if the Court refocuses on the various 

tranches of funding, including in Nogales itself and 

from the State, one will see that there has been a very 

substantial increase in the actual funding as well as 

progress.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I -- I agree with 

that. I think it was a vast mistake to extend a lawsuit 

that applied only to Nogales to the whole State, but the 

State attorney general wanted that done.

 MR. STARR: But we should be able now to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's -- that's water 

over the dam. That's not what this suit is about now.

MR. STARR: No, Your Honor, not under 60(b),

officials --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What has 60(b) got to do 

with the question of whether the attorney general 

represents the State before the court? If the attorney 

general comes back into court and says, no longer do we 

want this statewide, then you've got an issue. If the 

-- if the attorney general speaking for the State does 

not do that, then I don't see why Justice Scalia's point 

is not the answer.

 MR. STARR: Not under Arizona law. It is 

the governor who speaks and the attorney general is 

beholden --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So the district court is 

supposed to referee a fight between the governor and the 

attorney general at this point? Is that what's going 

on?

court is to listen to what the State has to say through

It should have listened to the --

The attorney general speaks for the State when the 

governor directs him or her to do that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he was speaking alone 

for years and years, and 60(b) -- and it has been said 

over and over again -- is not a substitute for appeal. 

What wasn't appealed was that Arizona is required by 

Federal law to determine the cost and adequately fund a 

statewide system of English acquisition programming.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which would be good enough 

to fix Nogales. So you are quite right. There is a 

vast difference in each district. But that attorney 

general wanted enough money to fund the whole State the 

way you have to fund to -- to fix Nogales. That's what 

he wanted.

continue to be able to bind the State. I would like to 

reserve the remainder of my time.

was a systemic violation of the EEOA. And the court 

further found that the program deficiencies were the 

result of the lack of funding rationally related to the 

programs.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask whether the 

requirements of the EEOA are at all affected 

by Congress's later enactment of the No Child Left 

Behind Act? I mean, you know, it's a very vague 

requirement that you make a good faith effort to -- to 

provide language assistance to children.

 Why shouldn't the courts decide that what 

constitutes a good faith effort is pretty much what 

Congress thought was necessary in the -- in the No Child 

Left Behind Act, and if you comply with that, you are 

doing okay?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Scalia, just one 

point of clarification on -- in our view on what the 

EEOA requires, and then I will address the No Child Left 

Behind point. The EEOA doesn't really require good 

faith efforts. It requires efforts that are in fact 

reasonably calculated to overcome language barriers.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I would call that 

good faith, but that's fine.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: With that -- With that 

clarification, thank you.

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: With that clarification on 

the question of whether No Child Left Behind sets the 

standard for compliance with the EEOA, which is, I 

think, what the petitioners' position is, we think the 

answer is no for two fundamental reasons. First is just 

a textual point.  The text of No Child Left Behind 

doesn't say anywhere that it displaces the standards for 

compliance with the EEOA.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I don't think that's their 

argument, counsel. I don't think that it is their 

argument that No Child Left Behind supplants the earlier 

act. It is simply their -- their argument is that it 

informs an interpretation of the language of EEOA, which 

is that the State is required to take appropriate 

action, which is a very vague standard.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I think their argument at 

the end of the day, Justice Scalia, is that if you 

comply with No Child Left Behind -- and I will get to in 

a moment what compliance with No Child Left Behind can 

mean -- then you have necessarily complied with the 

EEOA. That compliance with the No Child Left Behind 

sets the standard for compliance with the EEOA.

 And I don't think that is workable 

particularly when you take into account what petitioners

mean by "compliance with No Child Left Behind."

 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this question 

about the Ninth Circuit's decision, which is what we are 

reviewing? Suppose -- I know there -- there is a debate 

about how well Nogales is doing at this time. But let's 

suppose Nogales came in, and they said this: We had 

plan A back when this was originally litigated, and now 

we have an entirely different plan, and this plan 

doesn't cost one penny more than what we were spending 

in 2000. But it is a very good plan, and it has 

produced very good results.

 As I read the Ninth Circuit's decision, they 

would not grant relief from the judgment under those 

circumstances, because they focus exclusively on 

incremental funding for EEL programs and Arizona's 

funding model. Isn't that correct?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I -- I don't know 

that that is a correct interpretation of the EEOA. What 

we would say is that if the State came forward with a 

showing that completely regardless of funding the 

programs on the ground work, well, that would be 

something that the district court would have to take 

into account. But the state hasn't --

JUSTICE ALITO: No, but isn't -- that isn't 

really my question. Isn't -- isn't it the case that the

Ninth Circuit judged the -- the permissibility of relief 

under 60(b) solely with regard to incremental funding 

and Arizona's funding model?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: The Ninth Circuit focused 

on funding, Justice Alito, because that is the way the 

case has been litigated from the outset. And that's the 

way the State has said from the outset that it would 

achieve compliance with the --

JUSTICE ALITO: That's the way it was 

litigated originally, but I thought the whole focus of 

the motion for relief from the judgment was: We have a 

new plan, and it is not tied to funding, and it will 

produce good results without looking at incremental EEL 

funding. And wasn't the Ninth Circuit obligated to look 

at that?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think the Ninth 

Circuit was -- was required certainly to review the 

district court's inquiry into that. And what the 

district court found is at page 100-A of the appendix to 

the petition filed by the legislative intervenors. And 

what the district court found there is that the 

improvements today, although significant, failed to 

reach the high school; that they were fleeting. And --

and this is particularly significant. In addition, the 

district court also explained that it was premature to

make an assessment of many of the changes, because many 

of the new standards are still evolving.

 And the reason the district court said that 

is that -- is because of the enactment in 2006 of 

Arizona HB 2064, which changes the framework for 

administration and funding of ELL programs in a way that 

I think fortifies the district court's denial of 

complete dissolution of its judgment and -- and ensuing 

orders.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I guess, as I 

understand Justice Alito's question, if the prior order 

is based on funding a particular plan and the State 

comes back and says, this is a new approach. It could 

be for any number of reasons, and say that, you know, 

the plan is not working, or there have been other 

budgetary crises in the State that strain what we can 

afford to spend on this particular program. Here's 

another plan. The funding levels are different. You 

should look at it.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's wrong with 

that?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: There is nothing wrong with 

that, and it should be looked at. And the district 

court did look at it, and what the district court found

was that the claims of progress, although there had been 

progress, the progress hadn't reached the high school. 

The progress was fleeting and that it was premature --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not a question 

of progress; it's a question of the plan and the 

approach. And I understood the Ninth Circuit -- I'm 

looking at page 72a -- it talks about the ELL's specific 

funding that was based on the prior order. And what I 

understood the State's submission to be -- look at what 

the superintendent has done in this particular case, and 

so on, so that those specific funding levels aren't 

applicable. And I would have thought it an 

extraordinary enough thing for a district court to tell 

a State legislature: Pass this budget, and you, 

Legislature, pass it, and -- I guess -- you, Governor, 

sign it, or you are not going to be in compliance. And 

if they've come up with a different way with different 

funding requirements, I don't know why that's not a 

changed circumstance that justifies looking at the 

judgment --

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, the district court 

didn't issue that sort of order. And -- and the Ninth 

Circuit -- if you look at page 66a -- it did review the 

evidence in the record and fortified the district 

court's conclusion that the new plan, Your Honor,

Mr. Chief Justice, that was presented, which is to the 

effect that, regardless of funding, we have made 

advances based on management improvements that should 

satisfy the statute. That was the claim that was made 

by Petitioners. I think that's what you're alluding to. 

And the district court rejected that at page 100a, and 

the Ninth Circuit fortified the district court's 

rejection of it by looking at the evidence in the record 

concerning --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what page is this?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: It's at 66a. That the 

court of appeals reviews the testimony and fortifies the 

district court's conclusion that, based on the advances 

to date, there's still work left to be done. Because at 

the end of the day you have to have a plan in place.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I don't think 

the State -- I didn't understand the State to disagree 

that there's still work to be done. I thought that the 

plan -- the point was that their approach had changed, 

including by No Child Left Behind, that they don't have 

to reach the same specific funding levels that the 

district court order required. And what I understood 

the Ninth Circuit to say is, no, those specific funding 

levels are still in place.

fundamentally different assertions being made by 

Petitioners, if I understand it: One is what 

Justice Scalia alluded to earlier, which is that No 

Child Left Behind changed the legal landscape in a way 

such that compliance with No Child Left Behind, such as 

it is, sets the standard for compliance with the EEOA.

 Now, there's a distinct argument that's also 

being made which is that conditions on the ground have 

improved as a consequence of management improvements. 

Regardless of No Child Left Behind, this is a factual 

argument, that factually things have changed in a way 

that ought to let us from underneath the district 

court's supervision.

 Now, the -- they are different points, and I 

think the district court addressed both of them. With 

respect to the second one, where there is the facts on 

the ground, what is critical is that, in order to 

justify complete dissolution in a case like this, the 

Petitioners would have to show, not only that conditions 

have improved, but they have improved in a way that is 

durable and sustainable over time. And the district 

court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What degree --

MR. SRINIVASAN: -- doubted that.

do you think is necessary? Do you agree with the Ninth 

-- the Ninth Circuit says, "We cannot say the district 

court clearly erred when it found this burden was not 

met. A district in which the majority of ELL tenth 

graders failed to meet State achievement standards while 

the majority of native English speakers passed is not 

one whose performance demonstrates that the State is 

adequately funding ELL programs."

 Do you really think that you haven't 

complied with adequate funding of ELL programs until you 

raise all of the ELL students up to the level of native 

English speakers?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, I don't think the EEOA 

requires raising everyone. I think it requires --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's all this says. 

The majority doesn't --

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- doesn't meet the -- a 

majority of ELL tenth graders fail to meet the 

standards, but the majority of native English speakers 

do.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that's part of what 

it says, and I think what the Ninth Circuit is also 

alluding to with respect to the high school in 

particular that, if you look at State survey that

Petitioners rely on in -- in touting the improvements in 

certain schools, it also with respect to the high school 

shows that the two high schools in Nogales was ranked --

were ranked at the very bottom of the survey for ELL 

students.

 So there's problems on the ground, but what 

the district court focused on concerns the enactment of 

2064, which is that no matter was think about the 

improvements that have -- that have been made to date, 

the landscape fundamentally shifts upon the enactment of 

2064 because the administration and funding of ELL plans 

changes at that point. And it's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the new plan that 

we're talking about, is 20 -- there have been references 

-- well, now they have a new plan. Does everybody agree 

at least that the new plan is 2064?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I -- I think we would agree 

because that sets the charter for provision of programs 

to ELL students going forward from its enactment. 

That's the infrastructure from -- from here on out.

 And that -- there's three particular 

features of that that I think are significant and that 

fortify the district court's conclusion that complete 

dissolution was unwarranted.

 The first is the one that was raised by

Justice Souter, which is that whatever you think of the 

progress that has been made to date -- and the district 

court found that, while it was significant, it didn't 

suffice -- that changes from what can be brought to bear 

from here on out as half the resources that were 

available before, because that's the net effect of 2064. 

That's what the district court found, at pages 107 to 

108a of the Petition Appendix. And when you have half 

resources to work with -- at the very least I think what 

the district court thought in saying that it was 

premature to make an assessment is that we have to have 

some period to assess what happens on the ground as a 

consequence --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any --

MR. SRINIVASAN: -- of this new funding 

recipe.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does -- then does 

that stay true without regard to what is happening 

economically to the State? In other words, the district 

court can say: You've got to spend this much money on 

this program, and I don't care what it means for jails, 

roads, anything else, when there are profound changes in 

economic circumstances of the sort that everybody's 

experiencing lately.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, the -- the district --

the State would have to present that, Your Honor, and I 

don't believe the State to have done that so far. But 

the State would have to make the argument that funding 

constraints are inexistence in a way that doesn't allow 

us to -- to use one example -- to -- to put together an 

optimal program, and so here's the program that we want 

to put in place in --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, I --

MR. SRINIVASAN: -- jurisdictions.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I find it bizarre that we 

are sitting here talking about what the whole State has 

to do on the basis of one district which is concededly 

the district that has the most nonnative English 

speakers and has been a problem district all along. And 

we are saying whatever this district court says for --

for this school district applies statewide. Now, that 

is bizarre.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the mere fact that the 

State Attorney General acquiesced in that kind -- kind 

of a system at the outset, does that force us to still 

accept at this time that whatever is -- is necessary for 

Nogales is also necessary for the entire State?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Justice Scalia, I think 

that that issue becomes largely an academic one for the

following reason: that the reason that the State 

Attorney General made the acknowledgment that he did is 

that, under the Arizona State Constitution, funding 

decisions don't vary from district to district. So 

whatever funding menu is put into place in order to 

achieve compliance with the EEOA with respect to Nogales 

is going to be the same one that exists throughout the 

State.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'll let --

MR. SRINIVASAN: It's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'll let Arizona worry 

about that. It's -- it's another matter to have a 

district court decree that the whole State has to do 

this thing. And whether -- whether it's done equally or 

not would be a matter for the State courts to determine, 

instead of for this district judge to determine, right?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it could be, but I 

don't think there's really much of a dispute that the 

statewide funding measure doesn't really affect what the 

State's going to do in this case, because --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me very 

odd that -- assume you have a constitutional provision 

which says funding must be equal in each district. Then 

you find one district that's way behind, and that is, we 

will assume, is -- has been deficient in -- in providing

language education. You are saying that if the court 

orders more money spent for that district, it must 

automatically order money -- additional money for every 

other district in the State?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: No, absolutely not. Not --

certainly not in the abstract.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- yes, but that seems 

to me the necessary conclusion of your argument in the 

answer you gave Justice Scalia.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't think it's a 

necessary conclusion of my argument, Justice Kennedy. I 

think it's a conclusion that rests on we are in this 

litigation in this particular context, given the Arizona 

Constitution's uniformity clause. It's as a consequence 

of that clause that this issue even arises. And I think 

the Attorney General --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But, again, what you're --

you're saying that any time a district court in a single 

district orders more money to remedy a constitutional 

problem, that because of that clause it has to apply to 

every other district. That just can't be.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, if the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if -- and if it is, 

then that is a very good reason for the district court 

to cede its jurisdiction to the State authorities.

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, if the litigation had 

come up in a different way, Justice Kennedy, such that 

it had always focused exclusively on what happened in 

Nogales, including the funding aspect of the case, but I 

think what would have been appropriate is that the 

district court would have inquired about what funding 

resources belong to Nogales in particular. And then 

what would have happened by operation of State law would 

be that, whatever the funding calculus with respect to 

Nogales, it would automatically apply across the State 

because of the Arizona Constitution's uniformity clause.

 Now, in this case, the litigation -- the 

complaint was assessed against the entire State, and the 

Attorney General accepted that, and I don't think at 

this point in time we can revisit that, particularly 

when it's largely an academic question given the 

uniformity clause --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I gather it's 

often the case in institutional litigation of this sort 

that the political figures, whether it's the Governor or 

the Attorney General, can't go to the voters say, look, 

we should spend more money on this. So they go to the 

district court judge and say, make us spend more money 

on this. And they get the same result they'd wanted in 

a non-democratic way, particularly when there's a

division, such as here the legislature doesn't want to 

do something, and the Governor or the Attorney General 

does.

 So why should we put a lot of weight on what 

the representation is when we are at least concerned 

that it might be a -- I don't mean it in a pejorative 

sense -- but a collusive piece of litigation?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, two points, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and first -- and I don't mean to 

quibble, but the Attorney General did contest the 

litigation at the outset. What happened is, after a 

judgment was issued against the State, then I think 

there was an acquiescence in the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it's hard for 

the Attorney General to get funding from the legislature 

for all he wants to do, and this is a way for him to get 

it, to go to the legislature and say look, you don't 

have a choice.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, sure, 

Mr. Chief Justice, but I think what the Court did in 

both Rufo and Frew is it accommodated those concerns, 

and it accommodated the interest in finality that comes 

from judgments, and the interests in allowing a 

different set of State officials to suggest new programs 

to make that suggestion to the district court. And it

accommodated those in a way that requires a showing at 

the outset that there has been a significant change in 

facts or a significant change in law. And on --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask just a 

question that was confusing to me? What standard for 

changed circumstances do you understand the Ninth 

Circuit to have applied?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: The one that was outlined 

by this Court in Rufo.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which is?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: A significant change of 

facts or a significant change of law. And the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I am looking at page 

72a of the Ninth Circuit opinion, and the standard they 

use there is radically changed, not significantly 

changed.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, on page 49a they 

invoke the precise wording of this Court, cite Rufo for 

that proposition, and also --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if we have a --

if we are confused as to which standard they applied, 

because at one point they say significantly changed and 

at another point they say radically changed, what should 

we do?

effect to the articulation of the standard in the 

standard review question section of the opinion. Of 

course you could remand if you felt that it was 

necessary, but I think the reason why the Ninth Circuit 

uses the language such as Your Honor found in 72a is 

that it has to be considered in the context of the 

nature of the violation and the nature of the relief 

sought.

 The violation was a systematic one; the 

relief sought is a complete dissolution of the judgment 

and ensuing order, and in that context I think it is 

fair to say that what is significant is more significant 

than what would be the case in -- for example, in Rufo, 

where what was sought was a relatively modest 

modification of the consent order concerning whether you 

would have single bunking or double bunking.

 Now on the question of whether there is in 

fact a significant change or significant change of facts 

or significant change in law, on No Child Left Behind, 

Justice Scalia, to return to the question that you 

asked, the reason that No Child Left Behind in our view 

doesn't displace the standard for EEOA is that 

Petitioner's standard is that as long as the State has 

an approved No Child Left Behind plan, which is true of 

all 50 States, that they necessarily satisfy the EEOA;

and what that would mean is that even if a State didn't 

implement that plan, even if the State didn't -- didn't 

-- didn't have accountability measures that it in fact 

followed, that required school districts to achieve the 

annual measurement of progress that would be laid out in 

the plan -- notwithstanding all of that, a plaintiff 

would lack authority to come into the court and litigate 

his private cause of action under the EEOA and get a 

court order that requires the State to take appropriate 

action --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right but --

MR. SRINIVASAN: -- simply because the State 

will have had an approved plan.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. You 

could get the plan approved and then not fund it. But 

at least the additional funding demanded by the district 

court should be whatever additional funding is necessary 

to comply with the No Child Left Behind Act. Right?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: I -- I don't think so. 

Because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then it's not 

as simple as you made it. Of course, I agree with the 

fact that if you get approved under the No Child Left 

Behind Act and then don't fund it, of course that --

that won't satisfy your obligation. But if you have

gotten approved, the test for whether you are satisfying 

your obligation should be how much money would it cost 

to implement the program that you have gotten approved 

under the No Child Left Behind Act.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: The -- the No Child Left 

Behind Act doesn't -- it doesn't approve a particular 

program. What it imposes are voluntarily accepted 

funding conditions, and that includes --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't approve 

programs?

 MR. SRINIVASAN: No --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought the States had to 

submit a program.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: What the EEOA concerns are 

programs that are reasonably calculated to achieve 

overcoming language barriers.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Right.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: What No Child Left Behind 

concerns is, is there a testing program in place that 

calls for certain improvements in testing over time. As 

long as the plan describes the tests that will be taken 

and the progress that will be achieved or sought to be 

achieved over time, a plan will be approved. Now, even 

if the State doesn't achieve the plan -- the progress 

that is called for by No Child Left Behind --

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 It's important to recognize what Petitioners 

asked for here at the rule 60(b)(5) stage. That was 

complete dissolution of the court's immediate orders. 

It was not to just limit those orders just to Nogales; 

it was not to improve -- or to approve improvements in 

Nogales as an interim measure. As a result, the burden 

was on them to show either full compliance with the 

orders the district court had entered or material 

changed circumstances that made compliance unnecessary.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But couldn't the district 

court give them the relief to which they were entitled 

even if it was less than what they sought?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Certainly. But they didn't 

demonstrate that -- entitlement to that relief either. 

To the extended we are talking about the question of 

whether conditions had changed in Nogales that there was 

no longer an ongoing violation of Federal law, the 

district court held an 8-day evidentiary hearing, and it 

made factual findings showing that the problems had not 

ceased in Nogales. And as you noted, Justice Ginsburg, 

this changed circumstances argument that is now heavily 

relied upon by Petitioners was not the primary thrust of

their argument before the district court.

 The primary thrust of their argument was 

that HB 2064, which is the State's scheme for ELL 

education, had some serious -- would -- would satisfy 

the judgment; and their other argument was that No Child 

Left Behind completely preempts -- that was the language 

they use -- completely preempts and renders obsolete the 

EEOA.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, when you 

were starting out I heard you articulate a third 

standard, materially changed. What is your 

understanding of the standard applied by the Ninth 

Circuit? Was it materially changed, significantly 

changed or radically changed?

 MS. SAHARSKY: I understand it to be 

significant change, which, I don't see significant and 

material as being all that different. I think that 

the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I don't either 

but I see both of them being different from radically 

changed.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Again, I think if you look at 

the Ninth Circuit's opinion, particularly where it 

starts out with the standard of review, it cites this 

Court's precedents in Rufo and Agostini; it talks about

the need for significant changed circumstances. I 

understand that there are portions of the Ninth 

Circuit's opinion that say -- that have the radical 

change language, and again, I -- I think that that 

language is -- just reflects the arguments that 

Petitioners were making, that they wanted complete 

relief from these remedial orders and that, you know, 

the underlying judgment here was a systemic violation. 

I mean, it's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the district court on 

the 8-day hearing on remand make a finding that its 

incremental funding determinations that it had made 

earlier were an accurate way to measure compliance and 

to insist on compliance under the new immersion program?

 MS. SAHARSKY: If I understand your question 

correctly, and please correct me if I don't, but the 

district court considered two different arguments. The 

first was under House Bill 2064 which considered to have 

-- which continued to have this incremental funding. 

It's that we have two problems with House Bill 2064, 

which were the two-year cutoff and Federal funding 

problem.

 On the second question which -- the second 

argument Petitioners made which said, everything is fine 

in Nogales because we have money from other funds, the

district court said no, there's -- there's been an 

ongoing violation of Federal. Law you haven't met your 

burden of showing me that violation ceased because 

things aren't better in Nogales. Do --

JUSTICE ALITO: Why does it matter that 

there is -- why focus on incremental funding for ELL 

programs exclusively? What difference does it make 

where the money comes from -- where it comes from, 

putting aside federal money that can't be supplanted? I 

just don't understand that.

 MS. SAHARSKY: I think the reason the 

district court was focused on that because that was 

always the State's position that, in terms of the 

statewide scheme, that that is how they were going to 

fund ELL education. Now it -- and so the State was 

always, from 2000 up to the time of the district court's 

rule 60(b) hearing, going down this path whereby it 

would put in place an ELL program and then give this 

amount of funding --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that may have been 

their -- that may have been their position originally, 

but at the time of the 60(b) hearing, what difference 

does it make whether the money came from funds that were 

designated for ELL program, or from general State funds, 

or from county funds? What difference does it make

whether the money was taken from some other program that 

the school was operating?

 Suppose they fund -- they take the money for 

the ELL programs from money that was previously used for 

music instruction, or art, or gym, or teaching German or 

anything else. Now those may all be bad things, but 

what does that have to be with the EEOA?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, the district court 

could have found that the plan had changed and that 

funding could come from -- from different places. 

That's right, if the State had changed its plans or that 

Nogales otherwise would have sufficient funding from 

circumstances that -- or from other source, that would 

be one thing. But the district court found that Nogales 

doesn't have that funding from other sources.

 For example, it can't use the federal 

funding that it -- that the Petitioners claim could be 

used to solve its problem under the EEOA. There are 

specific conditions on federal grant programs that 

forbid that.

 It also could not raise any significant 

amounts of funding through county tax overrides, which 

was another source the Petitioners had said would --

would provide sufficient funding. So the question the 

district court had to ask is, there has been an ongoing

violation of federal law, has that violation of 

federal -- federal law ceased because the State has put 

in place, Nogales has put in place programs that are 

reasonably calculated to help these kids learn English?

 And the district court said Nogales has 

cobbled together these sources of funding. And it is 

doing the best they can.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But the fact that you keep 

talking about the district court emphasizes my concern 

about the decision of the Ninth Circuit, which is what 

we are reviewing. And as I read the decision of the 

Ninth Circuit, they focused exclusively on incremental 

costs associated with ELL programs and the educational 

funding model that the State had at that time.

 MS. SAHARSKY: With respect, I don't think 

that that was their exclusive focus. I understand that 

it was a primary focus of that decision, and the reason 

for that was because the primary argument --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, they say. They were 

required -- the Petitioners were required to demonstrate 

either that there are no longer incremental costs 

associated with ELL programs in Arizona or that 

Arizona's funding model was so altered as to make 

incremental costs issue relevant. That was their 

explanation of the holding, 60 -- 63A of the Speaker's

appendix.

 MS. SAHARSKY: That's right. And what I 

understand that to mean is that they were required to 

either show compliance with the judgment which was that 

they would put together a plan that funded ELL education 

based on incremental costs or that the State was going 

to go down a different path and come up with the funding 

some other way, and that would result in a program 

reasonably calculated to help ELL students earn English.

 And the district court found there were 

neither and the court of appeals found there were 

neither. And the court of appeals did go through the 

alleged changed circumstances, and Nogales had issued a 

91-page opinion that talked about the significant 

resource constraints that still exist in Nogales and the 

persistent achievement gaps that still exist in Nogales.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I still have trouble 

with the idea of district courts ordering State 

legislatures to fund it. Isn't the preferable approach 

for the district court to say you have a violation, you 

have to fix it, and I'm going check to see if you fixed 

it at particular intervals? And it's up to you, the 

State, to determine how you are going to fix it.

 And the State might change its mind. They 

may start out by saying we have got all of this extra

money and that's how we will fix it. Then there is a 

budget crisis, the kind that we are familiar with, and 

he says we can't the money, we are going to do it some 

other way, and here's the way.

 But that's kind of the judgment of the 

State, not for the district court.

 MS. SAHARSKY: And I think the district 

court was appropriately differential to the State 

throughout this litigation. You will note at the time 

of the 2000 judgment that the district court didn't put 

any remedial order in place. And that's because at the 

time of trial the State said, look, we are going to put 

in place an ELL program that everyone in the State can 

use and figure out how much it costs, what works and 

what doesn't. We are going to do a cost study, so 

please let us do the cost study and we will come back to 

the court.

 And the district court said fine. And ten 

months later that didn't happen.

 Now, there was a change, as Petitioners 

note, to a different theory of ELL education, structured 

English immersion and the court said, okay, do your 

program based on structured English immersion and just 

tell me how much it costs, tell me how you rationally 

fund it, and that will be fine. The district court here

did not want to be in the business of micromanaging 

State education. Through this entire litigation the 

district court was --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why does it order 

then -- why did its order specify and be linked to the 

termination of the legislative session, and say you have 

12 days left in the session and that's how many days you 

have to enact this budget?

 MS. SAHARSKY: I think it's because the 

State kept coming back to the district court and saying 

that the legislature had asked for this cost study, 

there was an interim bill, House Bill 2010, where the 

legislature said we put in place another study that we 

are going to perform. And it's because the State 

said -- constantly said the legislature is going to do 

this cost study, figure out how much good programs cost, 

the school -- the State board will be involved, 

et cetera, that the district court entered its orders 

looking to the time period in which it expected action 

to occur.

 I mean, this happened over a nine-year 

period. The district court, to be clear -- I think this 

is a very important point -- never said you need to do 

any special kind of ELL program, bilingual, structured 

English immersion, you need to have any certain number

of teachers, nothing like that. And it never said you 

need to put this certain amount of funding in place, 

$200, $300 per student, anything like that.

 And Petitioners at the rule 60(b)(5) stage 

faced a heavy burden to show if what they wanted to show 

was that the State was now going to go down this new and 

different path, because even at the time of the rule 

60(b)(5) hearing, the state Was on the same path. It 

had just passed House Bill 2064, which just like at the 

time of the 2000 judgment said we are going to put a 

statewide program in place for ELL education --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the district -- the 

district judge said that that 2064 did not have enough, 

it raised it to 450 or whatever. And the district court 

said there are three things wrong with it, the two 

years, using the federal funds to -- to supplant not 

supplement, and that the $450 figure wasn't enough.

 And the only way that $450 figure was going 

to get changed was through legislation, right?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Could I answer that? I think 

the problem with the $450 figure is that the district 

court was never told what the State was planning to buy 

with that, what that $450 was for. The State -- the 

district court just said to the State, please tell me 

what your programs are going to do and approximately how

much it costs to fund them. And that 450 wasn't tied to 

any particular ELL programs. That was the problem.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Saharsky, I have one 

late arriving question. Do you think that the 

constitutional -- State constitutional provision at 

least there has to be equivalent funding in districts, 

do you think that would be called into play if the 

Federal Government under a federal program gave 

additional funds to a particular district? Which I am 

sure it does, those districts that have federal 

facilities probably get additional -- additional money, 

would all the rest -- under this constitutional 

provision, would all the rest of the State have to belly 

up to that -- to that same level?

 MS. SAHARSKY: No, as I understand it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I doubt it.

 MS. SAHARSKY: -- when it's talking about a 

uniform --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah.

 MS. SAHARSKY: -- and equal amount, it's 

talking about the amount that the State gives to the 

school districts. It's not with respect to any federal 

funding from other sources.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if federal funding 

doesn't count, why would a federal decree applicable

only to a particular school district count?

 MS. SAHARSKY: I think that the idea was 

that there needed to be -- the State determined that 

there needed to be -- it was going to solve the problem 

statewide not only because of the concern under the 

State constitutions, that it would provide for all ELL 

students. And it was not that it would provide the same 

amount to each school district, but just the same amount 

per ELL student. That the State had decided that it was 

going to fill that responsibility because -- both 

because of the Constitution and because it's responsible 

for supervising education statewide. Thank you.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. STARR: Thank you.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me, Mr. Starr, 

based on this last argument, that it actually is in your 

favor if the order of the court as to one district 

automatically requires additional expenditure for every 

other district, that is simply one more measure that the 

Court should use in finding an alternate remedy.

 MR. STARR: Yes, Your Honor. The state 

funding remedy here is extraordinarily intrusive and

overreaching. It is something that has not been done 

under the EEOA ever, and certainly the No Child Left 

Behind provision should inform now this particular 

remedy. The remedy was originally, of course, designed 

to address the situation in Nogales, but it was 

expanded --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It is no content to the 

equal child -- No Child Left Behind. There is no 

content to it. All it requires is testing.

 MR. STARR: It's part --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't say how much it's 

going to cost.

 MR. STARR: But, Your Honor, there is a very 

elaborate plan that is submitted and then a 

determination is made by the Federal Government about 

funds under Title 1 and Title 3, but here is our 

fundamental submission. The Ninth Circuit simply 

applied the wrong 60(b)standard.

 It, in fact, used this remarkable language, 

but it also of radical change, but it also gave undue 

weight. It said it ten times to the fact that the 

original judgment was on appeal, and then it simply did 

not pay heed to the incredibly intrusive nature of a 

statewide funding remedy in light of the fact that we 

can now look at what has happened in Nogales. We see

the changes that have, in fact, been there, and 

certainly the EEOA by its design in section 1712 of EEOA 

makes it very clear that the remedial reach of the EEOA 

is quite limited. It's limited to particular 

circumstances.

 Here the EEOA has been transmogrified to 

apply statewide. That has not been done before. It 

should not have been done in the first instance but 

certainly in light of the changed circumstances.

 And the changed circumstances, 

Justice Ginsburg, go back to structured English 

immersion. They did not begin with the passage of HB 

2064. Structured English immersion came in in the year 

2000. That is why the legislature then came in and put 

these facts in evidence before the district court, which 

made no factual findings statewide at all, ever. There 

are no statewide factual findings in this record 

whatsoever, none. And therefore statewide funding 

remedy should not have been permitted. Sixty (b)(5) 

relief should be granted. I thank the Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
