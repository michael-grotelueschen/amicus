 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll hear argument now in the 

case of Miller-El against Dretke.

 Mr. Waxman.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court:

 In Hernandez v. New York, this Court explained 

that there are exceptional cases in which the totality of 

evidence surrounding jury selection is so strong that a 

finding of no discrimination is simply too incredible to 

be accepted by this Court. This is that exceptional case, 

a case in which even on collateral review, the sheer 

weight of the mutually reinforcing evidence renders 

objectively unreasonable the State court's conclusion that 

race did not motivate even one of the prosecution's 

peremptory strikes. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do we have to find that the 

strike of at least one African American prospective juror 

was race-based for you to prevail?

 MR. WAXMAN: I believe so. You have to find, 

Justice O'Connor, that race was the but-for factor or the 

tipping factor, not the only factor, but the but-for

factor for at least one to come within the four corners of 

Batson. 

Now, I could argue I think, if I needed to in 

this case, that the jury shuffle evidence alone, which is 

an unexplained, blatantly race-based means of racially 

excluding jurors from the venire, comes within Batson, the 

Batson proscription itself, or I could argue that case 

too. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were there any -- were there 

any State decisions, or Federal court decisions for that 

matter, justifying the shuffle on the grounds of -- I 

don't know -- professional class versus working class or 

something like that?

 MR. WAXMAN: The State has in its brief in this 

case, on this trip to the Court -- the State has cited the 

Court to one other case in which the Court of Criminal 

Appeals acknowledged the State's justification in that 

case, that it shuffled because there was a member of the 

probation office in the front row that they didn't want to 

embarrass and that jurors in the front had tended more to 

have ties than jurors in the back. That is -- that was 

never claimed in this case. We have, from the very --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were there -- were there any 

State court cases said that -- or even in that case you're 

referring to -- that the shuffle usually is race-based?

 MR. WAXMAN: You know, I can't -- the case is 

called Ladd v. State. There is -- there's some -- now 

some reasonably substantial Law Review commentary in the 

State of Texas. I cited the Court to -- to one in the 

Houston Law Review or the Houston Bar Review when I was 

here last time, and there has since been one in the St. 

Mary's Law Review that says this is a procedure that is 

used to discriminate on the basis of visual preference. 

And what's particularly interesting about it in 

this case is there was a contemporaneous objection in week 

2 and week 3 and week 4 that the State was doing this 

based on race, and the State offered no defense at the 

time. It offered no defense in the subsequent Batson 

hearing. It had no explanation before the magistrate, the 

district judge, the Fifth Circuit, in this Court or below, 

and now in this Court this time it says, well, there's 

this other case in which the reason given was that we 

didn't want to embarrass the probation officer and we 

didn't -- and we had people who had ties in the front row. 

There is no evidence whatsoever in the record that would 

justify those excuses here.

 And the evidence in the -- the only evidence in 

the record that seems to me compels the conclusion that 

this was done for the deliberate purpose of minimizing the 

number of African Americans on the jury. And it was done

by prosecutors, each of whom -- there were two prosecutors 

in this case, each of whom was found to have violated 

Batson in criminal -- other criminal trials 

contemporaneous with this one. And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the -- and the Fifth 

Circuit's answer to the jury shuffle was, well, the 

defense shuffled more times, as I --

MR. WAXMAN: The Fifth --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- as I recall. 

MR. WAXMAN: The -- the Fifth Circuit said that 

we -- that they shuffled twice and we shuffled five times. 

Now, that is both factually wrong and legally irrelevant. 

They shuffled three times and they tried to shuffle a four 

times -- a fourth time because, the Court will perhaps 

recall -- this was discussed in the Court's last opinion 

-- because they waived in the fourth week. The defense 

shuffled -- the defense then shuffled and they tried to 

come in and back -- back and shuffle again when a number 

of African Americans were advanced in the order.

 There -- under this Court's Batson 

jurisprudence, the proscription against using peremptory 

strikes for a racial purpose or a gender-based purpose is 

proscribed to the defense, as well as the prosecution, but 

there -- the one doesn't excuse the other, and there has 

never been a claim, nor is there a factual predicate laid

in this case for a claim, that Mr. Miller-El's trial 

lawyers were doing the same. Even if it were true, it 

would not justify what they did. 

Now --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- if we find or if there 

is a finding that the -- that the attempted shuffle on 

this fifth try was race-based, does that win your case, 

even though the shuffle didn't take place?

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, it was the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, does it show the 

necessary animus so that it carries through the whole 

case?

 MR. WAXMAN: I think, if I needed to -- I mean, 

we -- we've argued that the shuffle, just like the race 

coding of the cards in the pre-Batson era, the disparate 

questioning on minimum punishment and the graphic script, 

all reinforce what we think the record shows with respect 

to each of the six peremptory strikes that we challenge

 But if we didn't have that, Justice Kennedy, I 

would be here arguing that if I could show a single strike 

that was made for the purpose of eliminating African 

Americans from being considered for jury service, that 

that ought to come within this Court's proscription of 

Batson. Now, we haven't made that freestanding claim 

because I don't think we need that freestanding claim.

 The jury shuffle is a practice that exists only 

in the State of Texas and, to my understanding, has ever 

existed only in the State of Texas. So it's a -- it's a 

very peculiar phenomenon, but I think I could make the 

argument that, look, even if there weren't any of these 

six -- let's say they shuffled it so successfully that no 

African Americans came up. There simply were no African 

Americans out of the 108 who were questioned. It seems to 

me that that in and of itself would violate at least a 

generous reading of Batson. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, we really have to 

examine your -- you know, your allegations, I suppose, one 

at a time. It makes it a very complicated case.

 The -- the State's response to -- to your 

argument that two of -- of the State's attorneys involved 

in this case had been found to have made racially based 

strikes in the past -- the State's response to that is 

that that was not part of the evidence presented in State 

court, and therefore, it -- it is not a proper 

consideration in reviewing the State court decision. What 

-- what is your response to that?

 MR. WAXMAN: I think that's wrong. I think it's 

wrong, first of all, because those two cases had been 

decided by the Court of Criminal Appeals at the time it 

considered the Batson claim in this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was it brought to the attention

 MR. WAXMAN: I -- I am not sure. I don't have 

the -- neither the transcript nor the briefs are available 

for that argument. But it's -- the court -- they are 

judicial decisions of that court. The Court can take 

judicial notice of them and they are evidence. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, my. You mean anything out 

there that -- that a court could take judicial notice of 

can be -- can be charged to the court? My goodness, no. 

I think it was the burden of the -- of the defendant 

challenging the -- the strikes to bring -- bring that to 

the attention of the court. My goodness. 

MR. WAXMAN: Even -- I understand your argument. 

I can't tell you for sure -- and I don't believe anybody 

can -- whether those cases were or weren't argued before 

the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals because my 

understanding is -- I don't -- I have not seen the briefs 

that were filed in the Batson appeal, and I don't have the 

transcript of the argument.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Were -- were both of the cases 

cases of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals?

 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, yes. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Decided by the court -- the 

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.

 MR. WAXMAN: Yes. The -- the very same court. 

And in any event --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, now, Nelson -- there's 

Macaluso?

 MR. WAXMAN: Macaluso. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Macaluso and Nelson. Nelson 

wasn't involved in the jury selection in this case, was 

he? He came in --

MR. WAXMAN: He certainly was. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought he came in after --

after the jury had been selected.

 MR. WAXMAN: No. That was Mr. Kinne had the 

chickenpox, so the jury was -- the -- the voir dire took 

place. Mr. Macaluso and Mr. Nelson alternated the voir 

dire examination in the case, and those were the two 

prosecutors, Mr. Macaluso in the other Miller-El -- in the 

Chambers case and Mr. Nelson in Mrs. Miller-El's case.

 And interestingly, what the Texas Court of 

Criminal Appeals said with respect to Mr. Macaluso in the 

Chambers case is not only that he removed five out of five 

African Americans for reasons that violate Batson, but the 

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals also noted that he was 

using the same minimum punishment ploy that he used in 

this case in order to disqualify African American jurors. 

He -- the court actually goes and says, you know, with

three of these people, the State tried to disqualify them 

by asking them an open-ended question about what they 

thought the minimum punishment should be even though 

that's usually what the defense is concerned about. 

Precisely what happened in this case. 

Now, I'm not suggesting, Justice Scalia, that 

our case depends upon the -- this 404(b) evidence or not, 

and I think it's quite --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's the problem. 

We've got to go through each one of them one by one. 

MR. WAXMAN: Well, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and I'm -- you know, I 

don't remember the names of people involved in -- in prior 

cases in this Court. I -- I -- you know, if we said --

MR. WAXMAN: Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- you had this same officer 

before you, my goodness, I -- I wouldn't remember it.

 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, a -- first of all, 

these -- each of these cases was tried within months of 

Mr. Miller-El's case, and a finding by a -- the State's 

highest court that a prosecutor has engaged in 

intentional, deliberate, race discrimination in the 

selection of a jury I respectfully submit -- I certainly 

hope is not the kind of everyday finding that is easily 

forgotten.

 But in any event, you -- yes. You have to go 

through all of the evidence in the case, and what the 

evidence in the case shows is that, first of all, as this 

Court observed the last time it was here, the State's 

proper race-neutral rationales for striking African 

American jurors pertains just as well to white jurors who 

were not challenged and who did serve. 

It's -- you also have to look at the race-coding 

of the cards, race-coding that was done by prosecutors 

whom this Court observed last time were trained in an 

office culture suffused with bias against African 

Americans in jury selection.

 And you also have to look at, with respect, the 

remarkable disparity in the way in which African American 

and white venire members were questioned, both with 

respect to minimum punishment --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I --

MR. WAXMAN: -- and with respect to the graphic 

script. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask on the minimum 

punishment ploy? Did that ever work in this case or did 

any of -- of the trial judges ever grant a -- a challenge 

for cause on the basis of the use of the minimum 

punishment ploy?

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, I can't speak to other cases.

 But what's truly remarkable about this case -- I 

mean, there are many things that are truly remarkable 

about this case -- the State not only used this minimum 

punishment ploy with 90 -- 7 out of 8 of the African 

Americans, as opposed to only 2 out of 36 of the whites, 

but it actually tried to remove 2 of the African Americans 

in this case: Rand and Kennedy. It submitted them for 

cause based on their answers to those questions. And then 

interestingly, when that was denied and the State had to 

justify its -- to provide its race-neutral reasons for 

striking them, it didn't even mention it. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Their response --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you -- you haven't really 

answered my question yet. 

MR. WAXMAN: Oh, I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Does any -- did any Texas 

trial judge, to your knowledge, ever fall for this ploy, 

ever grant him a -- a challenge for cause based on answers 

to the minimum punishment harangue?

 MR. WAXMAN: I -- I would defer to Ms. Bunn 

about that because I don't know about other cases, but --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I didn't see any in this case.

 MR. WAXMAN: Well, what happened in this case 

was there was an effort to rehabilitate. The trial judge 

actually became quite energetic in trying to explain to

the juror that, well, it's 5 years and you're not saying 

that you couldn't possibly consider 5 years. But -- and 

that was true with respect to white jurors as well as 

African American jurors. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The respondent's reply to this 

-- this minimal punishment argument is that in fact the --

the two white prospective jurors who had -- who had 

expressed antagonism towards the death penalty were 

subjected to the same questioning, and that the seven out 

of eight black prospective jurors were seven who had 

expressed antagonism to the death penalty. Now, is that 

not true?

 MR. WAXMAN: I think that if I -- I believe that 

with respect to minimum punishment, as opposed to the 

graphic script, what the State is saying is last time we 

said there were 10 whites and 10 blacks who expressed 

hesitation. And this Court observed that, well, yes, but 

only two of the whites got it. Now, they filed a brief 

that says, well, the other eight were all either struck 

for cause or by consent. Now, that's -- that fails for at 

least two reasons. 

One, they identified 10. In this Court and 

below, we identified 19 jurors who absolutely expressed 

hesitation about the death penalty, and they have still 

not accounted for them. Number one.

 Number two, with respect to the eight who they 

have accounted for in their brief, the fact that at the 

very end of voir dire, they were struck for cause, or 

there was an agreement at the end of voir dire to remove 

them hardly provides a reason not to give the minimum 

punishment ploy to jurors who fit the categorization that 

the State has described. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we have to go through 

each one of them and see if the degree of hostility 

expressed by the white jurors was the same as the degree 

of hostility expressed by the black jurors. And in fact, 

the degree of hostility by the black jurors was quite 

high. 

MR. WAXMAN: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: One said I really don't believe 

in it. I support it only in extreme cases, such as those 

involving mass killings or mutilation. And another one --

another one said, well, right now maybe I do, but who 

knows later? 

MR. WAXMAN: I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, if -- if there happens to 

be a different attitude towards the death penalty among 

the black jurors than there is among the white jurors, you 

cannot fault the -- the attorneys for -- for striking more 

of the black jurors.

 MR. WAXMAN: Justice Scalia, in the context of 

all of this other evidence, which is the context in which 

you need to weigh it and determine whether we have 

satisfied the stringent standard for review that applies, 

I respectfully submit that if you go through the -- the 

voir dire questioning of Mr. Fields and Mr. Warren and Mr. 

Rand and the others that we've mentioned, and compare it, 

even leaving aside all of the other evidence, 

contemporaneous evidence, of race discrimination in the 

jury selection in this case, I think you will have to come 

to the conclusion that race was a but-for factor in these 

cases. 

In Mr. Fields -- we've -- we've mentioned him in 

our -- we've described him at length in our brief. This 

is a man whom -- I mean, forget the -- the State on its 

questionnaire at the time, on page 14 of the joint 

lodging, wrote, quote, no reservations against the death 

penalty. 

Mr. Rand, who we've compared and -- and your 

concurring opinion, Justice Scalia, the last time it was 

here said, well, yes, Rand and Mazza are very close, but 

it's a high burden you have to -- you have to overcome 

here. It's a burden we can overcome here not only because 

of all of this other evidence, but because of what the 

State wrote on the questionnaire when Mr. Rand was being

State's notes, Quote: "could be enforced depending on the 

circumstances -- Murder/robbery, type of offense -- Think 

proper for death penalty -- Yes, I can serve." This is a --

this is a venireman who said that if he were Governor, he 

would set the minimum punishment for murder at 99 years. 

Mr. Fields was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, now, wait. He also said 

-- when asked whether he could vote to impose the death 

penalty, he said, right now I say I can, but tomorrow I 

might not.

 MR. WAXMAN: He said --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think that's a strong --

MR. WAXMAN: I'm -- I'm not sure whether that's 

Rand or Warren, but I'm saying that if you compare Mr. 

Rand who thought that the death penalty might be 

applicable for all murder, who repeatedly -- in our reply 

brief, we include the -- the recitation -- repeatedly said 

over and over and over and over again that he would answer 

the three questions yes, depending on the evidence, 

without any regard for his view about the death penalty, 

who testified that -- I'm not saying that this is somebody 

whom, if this were a case in which there was nothing in 

this -- we were just before this Court saying there's Rand 

and Mazza or there's Rand and Hearn and that's enough to

satisfy our burden, I would be up here arguing it but it 

would be a much more difficult argument. Here, those --

that comparison has to be taken in the context of not one, 

not two, but six jurors who are similarly situated who 

were treated to this questioning by people who engaged in 

racially disparate shuffling, racially disparate 

questioning --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's the question. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: We have to deal with each of 

the six one by one, and -- and they have arguments with 

respect to each of them. I don't care what Rand said. 

Those things that you said sounded very good. But if he 

finishes it off by saying, right now I say that, but 

tomorrow I might not --

MR. WAXMAN: Well, I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that doesn't strike me --

and that -- that's what respondent says Rand said, not --

not one of the other ones. And you have to go down each 

of the other six, and they have a response for each one.

 MR. WAXMAN: And if this --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, and -- and, you know, a 

buckshot attack on it has to be examined pellet by pellet.

 MR. WAXMAN: Justice -- let me -- let me switch 

your metaphor a little. The problem with the State's 

approach to this case -- and it was the problem that -- of

the Fifth Circuit's analysis -- is it is pointillistic. 

It is an analysis. It's like walking up close to a Seurat 

painting and looking at each dot and saying, well, it's 

red, but that might not necessarily be the handbag. Yes, 

you have -- I mean, he had to paint with the dots, but as 

a reviewing court, you need to step back and look at this 

and ask yourself, with respect to, for example, Mr. 

Fields, who said not only would he have no hesitation 

about putting the death penalty in place, but he actually 

testified that he thought that in capital cases, the State 

was God's embodiment on earth. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that you have 10 white 

jurors and 10 black jurors. The 10 black jurors are all 

questioned much more extensively by the State, and in each 

of those cases, there is a plausible reason for excusing. 

A relative was -- served time and so forth. Violation?

 MR. WAXMAN: All in and of itself? I would say 

definitely not. I -- I mean --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so then you admit that 

you have to go one by one. I had thought you would --

would have said that if the black jurors are questioned in 

a different way and more intensively, that alone suffices 

even though the questioning in each case disclosed the 

basis, plausible, non-racial basis --

MR. WAXMAN: No, I would give --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- for excusing them. 

MR. WAXMAN: I would give you a different 

answer, Justice Kennedy, if it's the jury shuffle because 

there's no plausible explanation available on the evidence 

in this case. If there is a plausible explanation for 

disparate questioning, which there is not in the 

statistics in this case, I wouldn't be arguing that that 

in and of itself, leaving aside individual, you know, 

side-by-side juror comparisons, would suffice. 

But here, we have, in addition to the disparate 

questioning that is not susceptible to a race-neutral 

explanation -- we have things like the prosecutor's own 

notations in the -- in the questionnaires. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, you were dealing 

with Fields, and the answer in Fields' case that the 

prosecution gives is he had a strong feeling about 

rehabilitation, and so he was -- he thought that everyone 

could be rehabilitated -- rehabilitated. So that shows he --

he wasn't like others who didn't entertain those doubts 

about rehabilitation.

 MR. WAXMAN: Yes, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg. 

He -- he expressed an opinion that he thought that people 

could be rehabilitated, not as strong as those opinions by 

juror -- white Juror Hearn and white Juror Duke who sat. 

But in Fields' case, he was absolutely unequivocal -- I'm

-- I'm referring the Court to page 185 of the joint 

appendix -- absolutely unequivocal that the ability or 

propensity for rehabilitation would not affect his 

willingness to -- to put in the death penalty. I believe 

in the dissenting and concurring opinions in this case 

last time with respect to Mr. Fields, it was pointed out 

that he was a supporter of the death penalty who could put 

in the death penalty. 

And what's interesting about Fields is if you 

look at the transcript pages where the prosecutor 

justifies the strike, on page 197 of the joint appendix, 

the prosecutor says, well, he was -- he -- he -- I -- he 

-- he said something about rehabilitation, and it goes on. 

And then two pages later -- they have a discussion about 

something -- a discussion about which questionnaires will 

or won't go into evidence. Two pages later, Mr. Nelson 

comes in and says, oh, yes, and he also had a brother who 

had had some involvement with law enforcement. Well, to 

say that that's an afterthought is really saying 

something. He wasn't questioned about it, as -- as 

neither were -- by the State, as neither were any of the 

four white jurors who sat who had family members who had 

been arrested or prosecuted. They didn't even ask these 

questions. 

May I reserve the balance of my --

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was there any evidence that 

the jury cards in this -- in the actual trial were marked 

or noted on the basis of race?

 MR. WAXMAN: Oh, absolutely. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Where do we find that 

evidence? 

MR. WAXMAN: The -- the juror cards are in the 

joint lodging beginning on page 82, and every single card 

lists the gender and race, even the cards as to jurors 

that they never questioned. So we know that these were 

notations that were placed on the cards by the prosecutors 

at the time the venires were called. 

And the interesting thing about these is it's 

not just race and gender, it's were they fat, did they 

have a beard, did they have a mustache. If you map up 

what's noted on these cards with the Sparling training 

manual that said don't take minorities, don't take Jews, 

don't take women, don't take fat people -- people who have 

mustaches and beards don't make good jurors. It's --

these prosecutors were not only trained by that manual, 

they learned their lesson very well. 

May --

JUSTICE SCALIA: All of those things are okay, 

right, except the race one.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENA BUNN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. BUNN: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court:

 The big picture. The majority of African 

Americans summoned for jury duty in this case were either 

opposed to the death penalty generally or unwilling to 

impose it, while the majority of white jurors had no 

qualms about the death penalty. Striking prospective 

jurors based on their case-related views which, after the 

fact, correlate with race is not unconstitutional. 

Essentially, though Miller-El has presented this

case as one of disparate treatment, it is actually one of 

disparate impact. I will discuss first --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would -- would the statement 

that you gave -- let's assume there was a -- a working 

premise that blacks were more -- were less inclined to 

impose the death penalty. Would that alone justify more 

intensive questioning of every black juror?

 MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, it would not. And 

the record in this case actually does not support that 

that -- does not support a proposition that black jurors 

were questioned differently. Most significantly, the 

minimum -- the questioning on the graphic script. Of the 

six challenged jurors in this case, only two received the 

graphic -- graphic script at the outset of their voir 

dire, Carrol Boggess and -- and Wayman Kennedy, both of 

whom had answered the questions in their juror 

questionnaire indicating ambiguity regarding their views 

on the death penalty regarding their support for the death 

penalty. This fact --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now -- now, as I understand it, 

this case was here before. We all read this and we went 

through it, and as a result of that, I -- if I read the 

opinion -- not the dissent, but the majority opinion --

and it might be in my interest if people followed dissents 

more, but I think the law is we follow the majority

opinion. 

So when I read the majority opinion, I read, 

number one, there was history in this county, at least 7 

years earlier though, where they actually had a booklet 

which said let's keep all the African Americans out, 

here's how you do it. 

Then you had jury shuffling, which were two 

instances. In one of them, there are like 40 people. In 

my mind, you know, we have rows. In row 1 there are four 

black jurors and six white; row 2, three black and seven 

white; row 3, two black and in the last row one black, and 

the prosecution says, hey, let's shuffle it. All right? 

And the other time he did it, the only other time -- it 

wasn't quite that bad -- the same idea.

 Then the third thing that comes up is you find 

instances here -- not everyone, absolutely right -- but 

instances where black people who seemed really for the 

death penalty, say, like Mr. Fields manages to get knocked 

off, but Mrs. Mazza who seems quite uncertain is kept on.

 And then we have this disparate questioning that 

you're about to mention where it just turns out that 

almost every black is given this really -- you know, bring 

them in a gurney, put -- put -- you know, real graphic 

description of the death penalty, and white people who 

also expressed hesitation aren't. Okay?

 So on the basis of that, the majority writes 

there is, indeed, a strong suspicion here that this was 

discrimination. So I want to ask you -- and if I were to 

write something like that -- I didn't write the words, but 

I would mean, well, I think that's what it is unless 

there's something later on that comes out to the contrary. 

So I'm asking you what was to the contrary. What came out 

in this Fifth Circuit that we didn't have in front of us 

the last time?

 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, the first time before 

this Court, the issue was whether, based on a threshold 

examination of the record --

JUSTICE BREYER: I know that was the issue, but 

I'm saying if I read the opinion to say -- now, maybe 

you'll tell me I shouldn't. We should just go back and 

redo what we did. But I'm reading the opinion to say, 

well, unless something changes here, this is bad. It's 

discriminatory. Now, you can tell me, one, I'm wrong to 

read the opinion that way. I got that argument. But I 

want to be sure that that's what's in front of me. So I 

want to know is there something different in the Fifth 

Circuit that wasn't here the first time. 

MS. BUNN: Your Honor, I believe the most -- the 

most important difference in the review of this Court the 

last time and the review of this -- of the Court this time

is that the Court did take a big-picture look at all of 

the pieces of evidence, but at this point, as the court of 

appeals did and as this -- as this Court must do now, it 

must go, as Justice Scalia mentioned, juror by juror, the 

jurors who were challenged. Miller-El --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We only speak to the issues 

before us, don't we? And the issue before us last time 

was not the issue before us here. It was simply whether 

there was enough evidence to require the issuance of a 

COA. Isn't that right?

 MS. BUNN: That is correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Right. That's why I asked. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's a good deal 

different. Whatever the majority might have said about 

other issues, it certainly was not binding on the court of 

appeals, was it?

 MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I hate to say this --

JUSTICE BREYER: So that must be a different 

question --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- to my colleagues, but I'm 

very much interested in hearing what Ms. Bunn has to say.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- because that wasn't the one 

I asked. The one I wanted answered was the question of I 

understand that point, which we could say it was

definitely not definite the last time. I'm asking you --

it's a serious question -- as whether there was something 

new or different that came up when the Fifth Circuit wrote 

this. Now, I gathered from your answer, it might be yes, 

and if the answer is yes, I want you to say what it is 

because I'm interested. 

MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, there was additional 

analysis, particularly of the six jurors Miller-El claims 

were discriminated against, which this Court did not 

review the first -- in its first opinion specifically. 

And a review of Miller-El's purposeful discrimination 

claim must focus on these six jurors.

 And given the -- the views expressed by these 

six veniremen, it is no surprise that prosecutors struck 

them. Each venire member peremptorily struck by the State 

had voiced views unfavorable to the State but were not 

subject to a challenge for cause. These reasons are race-

neutral, case-related, and supported by the record, in 

fact, supported by the very words that the jurors uttered.

 Carrol Boggess indicated that her beliefs -- on 

the questionnaire indicated her beliefs would impair --

would impair her ability to impose the death penalty as a 

juror. She referred to her -- an execution as a murder 

during her voir dire and other comments evincing hesitance 

regarding her ability to impose the death penalty.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this? There are 

two questions just generally. One, I'm curious about the 

answer to my question to -- to Mr. Waxman. Did the 

minimum punishment ploy ever work? Did it ever succeed in 

getting a challenge for cause granted?

 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, there are other cases 

that I'm aware of in Texas where the State did challenge 

jurors on this basis. Whether there was any questioning 

-- any difference in questioning, I don't know. It's not 

apparent from the records. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But have -- and the challenges 

were granted? 

MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, none of them were 

granted in this case. Is that right?

 MS. BUNN: That's correct. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: So it -- it was true that this 

was -- was a ploy adopted for the purpose of trying to 

make it unnecessary to use a -- a peremptory challenge. 

MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Your Honor, 

that is right. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And do you defend that 

practice?

 MS. BUNN: Yes, if it is a legitimate tactic, 

recognized -- as an attorney, if there is a -- some means

that is available to use so that you do not have to use a

JUSTICE STEVENS: If you -- if you can get the 

venire person to make a mistake in his answer, then you --

you get -- get him off easy. 

MS. BUNN: That's what -- that's what voir dire 

is all about, and the defense counsel did it in many 

occasions --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And suppose -- suppose you 

have a system in which that attempt to find cause is 

applied much more rigorously to black prospective jurors 

than to white prospective jurors.

 MS. BUNN: If it's not -- the record shows that 

there's no difference in the views expressed by the 

jurors, yes. In this case that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. The -- the white jurors 

don't express the views at all because they're not 

questioned intensively, so you don't know if there's cause 

for them or not. But the black jurors are questioned 

intensively, and you find cause or -- or a -- a race-

neutral reason for the dismissal. Is there a Batson 

violation in -- in that instance?

 MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor, not a Batson 

violation. Now, whether it's evidence of -- of --

case you can question black jurors more intensively than 

white jurors and still succeed in excusing them if the 

result of that voir dire shows some race-neutral basis.

 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, if the questioning itself 

results in the views that are the basis of the strike, 

that would present a problem. That is not the case here, 

however, where the -- the disparate questioning on minimum 

sentencing, for instance, was based on the views that were 

expressed. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose you have a 

manual of -- from the district attorney's office that says 

all black jurors shall be questioned more intensively than 

white jurors.

 MS. BUNN: That would certainly be evidence that 

black jurors and white jurors were treated differently. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying that that is not 

what happened here. 

MS. BUNN: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It was on the basis of the 

questionnaires expressing hostility to the death penalty 

that more intensive questioning was given to some people 

than to others, and that the mere fact that a larger 

number of those people was black is not a violation.

 MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but you don't know what

persons, do you?

inference that some of them might have expressed doubt 

about the death penalty?

 MS. BUNN: That is -- we do not know. There --

even though we do not know --

JUSTICE BREYER: You don't know. If you don't 

know, you -- there's an excellent way to know. Somebody 

says, you know, Mr. Prosecutor, you gave this terribly 

graphic script to all the black people and you really 

didn't give it to hardly any of the white people. Now, 

it's also possible -- possible -- that the reason he 

didn't was because from the answer to their 

questionnaires, which we've not seen, you didn't need to. 

That's possible. But if that were the case, wouldn't he 

have said to the judge, Judge, that's why I did it. I 

didn't ask them because I read the questionnaires. 

Wouldn't that be what you would do or any prosecutor would 

do if that were the reason?

 MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor, I would. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And did the prosecutor ever do 

that here?

 MS. BUNN: No, but significantly in this case, 

the arguments regarding disparate questioning were never 

raised until Federal habeas corpus proceedings. They were 

not raised at trial when the jury questionnaires still 

existed.

JUSTICE BREYER: No. And did -- was anyone 

there who had ever talked to the prosecutors?

 MS. BUNN: The prosecutors were contacted during 

that period, but the questionnaires --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So could then --

MS. BUNN: -- no longer existed at that point. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But couldn't you have asked the 

prosecutors if that was the reason?

 MS. BUNN: 20 -- 15 years after a case is 

tried --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, what are we supposed to 

do? I mean, what you've done is say -- of course, I could 

think of reasons that could have been their reason, but 

unless there's some reason for thinking that was their 

reason --

MS. BUNN: Well, Your Honor, in this case, the 

-- the inmate Miller-El has the burden. He had the burden 

in the trial court. He had the burden to prove purposeful 

discrimination, and he could have put -- he did put the 

questionnaires of the 10 challenged jurors in the record. 

He did not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on -- on that point,

this is not exactly like McDonnell Douglas, Burdine where 

you have some prima facie case, the person was equally 

qualified, but was of a different gender than the one that 

got the job, and then the -- you go back to square one.

 Here, the prima facie case is immensely powerful 

because of the culture of discrimination in the manuals 

and so forth, and that -- that, it seems to me, stays in 

this case.

 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, this evidence, however 

compelling a picture it draws of past injustice, simply 

cannot trump the State court's finding of no purposeful 

discrimination. It does not address --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, don't we at some point 

have to have some reason to believe that the evidence of 

past practices become irrelevant? And if we -- if that is 

so, do we have any such evidence here?

 MS. BUNN: There -- there was evidence in the 

Swain hearing, and that -- in fact, the cross examination 

by the prosecutors did indicate that practices that were 

in the past had been -- had been vitiated, at least closer 

to the time of trial. But regardless of that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: These are the same two 

prosecutors who in other cases had been found, in effect, 

guilty of -- of racial discrimination and the same two 

prosecutors who were calling for the shuffle in these

cases. Is it plausible to think that there had been this 

change of heart?

 MS. BUNN: Even assuming the evidence, the 

historical evidence -- assuming its relevance, as the 

Fifth Circuit did --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I mean, I -- I am 

assuming it is relevant, and I am asking the question, is 

there a reasonable basis to think that these particular 

individuals, engaging in the practice that they 

demonstrably engaged in, had had a change in heart in this 

case?

 MS. BUNN: Yes, Your Honor. The record in this 

case indicates that -- for instance, with the use of 

graphic script questioning, the -- of the six -- again, of 

the six challenged jurors, four did not receive the 

graphic script at the outset of voir dire. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that why they engaged in the 

shuffle twice --

MS. BUNN: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- on -- on a record that shows 

there were black jurors down front each time they engaged 

in it?

 MS. BUNN: The record shows that of 5 weeks of 

voir dire, the State requested shuffles three times. Two 

of those times, the defense counsel put on the record that

there were a greater number of African American jurors in 

the front of the panel. They --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and that evidence was 

not refuted. It was not denied, as I understand it.

 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, there was no response 

from the prosecutors. There was no objection made, no 

specific objection made as to -- as to the State's 

exercise of a jury shuffle. But in this case to ask this 

-- what -- what Miller-El is asking this Court is to 

assume that the only discernible trait that could have 

been the basis for the State's exercise of a jury shuffle 

is race, and that is not -- that is not the case. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: The -- I -- I don't think 

that's his argument at all. He is not arguing that there 

might not be other bases for making challenges or making 

peremptory strikes. What he is saying is those challenges 

exist for lots and lots of jurors. And what in fact there 

is is very strong circumstantial evidence that what tipped 

the prosecutors to make the peremptory challenges here --

what he was referring to earlier in this argument as the 

but-for cause was racial. He's not saying nothing else 

could have been involved. He was saying race tipped it. 

And it's the circumstantial evidence, among other things, 

that indicates that race does. 

And that's the reason for my question. Is there

some reason to believe that there had been a change of 

heart on the issue of race so that his argument is 

unsound?

 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, again, Miller-El's claim 

of purposeful discrimination must focus on these six 

jurors, and in answer to your question, a review of these 

six jurors does show that these strikes were not based on 

race. This was not the tipping --

JUSTICE BREYER: You think they're based, for 

example, on capital punishment. But now, let me give you 

two of them, and this is why -- this is actually why I get 

somewhat concerned about this. 

Here is the answer of the white woman who served 

on the jury about capital punishment. Could you put 

Miller-El to death? Mrs. Mazza: It's difficult. I've 

had 2 days to think about it, and given my religious 

upbringing, et cetera, going on for a few sentences, I 

think I could. She serves on the jury. Okay?

 Here's Mr. Fields who is black and whom they got 

off. What I think, according to the Old Testament, people 

were killed if they violated His law. In its extended 

service, the State represents Him. I feel the State is 

God's extended person. In other words, the State 

represents God in today's time. Therefore, if the State 

exacts death, that's what it should be. Okay?

 That's the man they feel has the qualm, and the 

woman I told you who was white they feel has no qualm. 

Now, I look at that, and I say, you know, I 

mean, my goodness, it's pretty hard to see how you get 

yourself in that frame of mind.

 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, the -- that was not the 

prosecutor's argument at trial and it's -- it is not our 

position now that --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. I know. They then said 

that oh, you see, Mr. Fields was -- is it a woman or a 

man? I'm not sure. Yes, he's a man I think. He -- he's 

kept off, the black man, because of his views on 

rehabilitation. So I looked up what those views were, and 

that consists of his saying -- my -- my interpretation --

well, I think any person, if he really believes in God, 

really believes in God, could be rehabilitated. At which 

point the prosecutor says to him, well, suppose you came 

to the conclusion that Miller-El really was touched by 

God, could you put him to death? Answer: Yes. Why? 

Because, well, it seems to me my job here is to follow the 

law. 

That's the man whom they think they are -- they 

are kicking off because of his views of possibly not 

applying the death penalty, and the other woman, who is 

white, they keep on. Now, I think that's the whole story

there. There was also the brother who was a drug -- who 

was the drug -- you know, he had had drug convictions, but 

that's scarcely mentioned. So -- so I look at those two 

people and I think, gee, put that in context. My 

goodness. 

What -- what's your response to that?

 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, as to Juror Billy Jean 

Fields, he did not express qualms about the death penalty 

in general, but he did state that it was his belief that 

no one -- no one -- no matter their background or what 

they've done, is beyond rehabilitation. Everyone can be 

rehabilitated. And this was a view regarding 

rehabilitation that no one, white or black, had expressed. 

It was a unique view, and in this case where jurors are 

asked to -- to -- the question, is this person going to be 

a continuing threat to society, is -- is something that's 

going to go into their punishment inquiry. And if this 

person is one who the prosecutor believed could tend -- if 

there's a repentant criminal defendant on the stand who 

testifies, that they would tend to believe that person and 

answer the question no.

 And -- and again, this was not the only basis 

for the State's strike as well. The fact that his brother 

had been prosecuted in Dallas County numerous times, the 

same prosecuting authority, contemporaneous with the

trial, numerous occasions, had served time, and contrary 

to Miller-El's assertions, the State did question Mr. 

Fields on this issue during voir dire, and it was a basis 

for the strike. There --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Bunn, before you finish, 

there -- there are two pieces of this I hope you can give 

me an answer to. The race-coding. Is there any neutral 

reason for that? And when was that stopped, if it was?

 MS. BUNN: I -- I don't -- I don't have any 

information. There's no information on -- in the record 

about exercising it in other cases, and I just -- I just 

don't know.

 But the first part of the question, there could 

-- as Mr. Waxman mentioned, there -- there were other 

visual cues noted on the cards. Attorneys, especially --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is it not a fair inference 

that each of the cues noted on the cards was something 

that the prosecutors thought relevant to whether or not to 

challenge the juror? And if so, is it not -- does -- is 

that not uncontradicted evidence that the race of the 

venire person was a factor in the decision? 

MS. BUNN: Not necessarily. I mean, there were 

other -- there was other --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why else would it be 

noted?

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe the prosecutors didn't 

want to come up with an all-white jury for fear it would 

be challenged. 

MS. BUNN: That's certainly --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That may be, but is it not --

is it not clear that this is one of the factors that was 

used to decide whether or not to exercise a challenge, 

just as the beard and the other things that are mentioned 

in the -- in the manual were?

 MS. BUNN: No, Your Honor. The fact that it was 

noted on the race -- on the -- on the juror card does --

does not necessarily indicate that. Again, it could be a 

cue for a -- a litigant preparing for voir dire. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, were the -- were the 

cues on the card similar to the instructions in the 

manual?

 MS. BUNN: There were some that could -- that 

would correlate, but there were others that aren't noted 

on the juror cards --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you quantify the 

correlation or lack of correlation for me?

 MS. BUNN: The -- for instance, occupations were

addresses were -- were noted. There could have been other 

things at that point that were not noted. There was a lot 

-- information available at that point, whether visual or 

from the juror information cards. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I had asked you if they were 

still race- and gender-coded. You hadn't gotten to that 

part of the question. These cards were race-coded and for 

other things too. Right now in the State, do the 

prosecutors code cards -- cards for race and gender?

 MS. BUNN: I do not know. I do not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The other question I had, are 

these two prosecutors the same ones who were involved in 

other cases where it was determined that they had used 

tactics that violated Batson? Were those cases 

contemporaneous with Miller-El's or were they earlier in 

time?

 MS. BUNN: The record indicates that Prosecutor 

Macaluso was involved in jury selection in the Chambers 

case, and that case was tried shortly -- I believe it was 

late 1985 when Chambers was tried. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Wasn't that 2 months? 

MS. BUNN: 2 months? This was March, so it 

would have been probably 4 or 5 months, within a year

certainly. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it unlawful to take 

sex into account in jury selection?

 MS. BUNN: Yes. Yes, Your Honor, it is. That's 

certainly not alleged in this case. The jury actually 

consisted of seven women. 

But again, to -- the -- the race-coding issue --

as far as whether it's exercised now, I mean, I wouldn't 

be particularly surprised if it were. A conscientious 

litigant -- it's really necessary to keep track of the 

race of prospective jurors, as Justice Scalia noted, to be 

certain that you don't run afoul of Batson. But --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- is that true with respect 

to weight and mustaches and things like that?

 MS. BUNN: That -- that doesn't --

JUSTICE SOUTER: They were -- they were making 

notations of things like that, as I understand it, and 

they didn't have to worry about Batson there. But there 

does seem to be a correlation with the manual. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And Batson hadn't been decided 

yet. 

MS. BUNN: Yes, that's true. I was referring to 

Justice Ginsburg's question about the -- the practice, 

whether it continues.

would -- I would say that it -- it's not -- does not 

necessarily lead to the conclusion that it was noted 

basically to treat African American venire members 

differently because the record actually --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But I -- I don't -- I mean, I'd 

just like to go back to my question. I don't know why 

else? It's true if -- if all they noted, if they had been 

prescient and had said, you know, Swain is going to give 

way to Batson and we're going to note Batson issues, you'd 

have an argument. But they were noting a lot of non-

Batson issues too, and the one common characteristic of 

the Batson issues and the non-Batson issues were they were 

all correlated to a manual that says keep these people off 

the jury. And -- and isn't that a sound train of 

reasoning that that's what they were trying to do?

 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, the -- the notations, 

though, correlate as well to simply visual cues that a 

litigant will use just simply to familiarize himself with 

the panel.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The manual had said there are 

certain visual cues that indicate jurors you don't want on 

the jury. You don't want black jurors. You don't want 

women jurors. You don't want Jewish jurors. You don't 

want fat ones. You don't want bearded ones. And these 

are the things that they were noting. Isn't the

reasonable inference that that's what they were noting 

them for?

 MS. BUNN: Your Honor, there are other 

explainable reasons, there are other plausible reasons for 

noting those things. But even that aside, again, we must 

look at these six jurors and they all expressed views 

unfavorable to the State. And Miller-El has failed to 

identify a similarly situated white juror. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the Fifth Circuit 

said that comparing Rand's testimony -- that that was in 

line with Mazza's. The Fifth Circuit seems to recognize 

that those two were closely comparable. 

MS. BUNN: Justice Ginsburg, they recognized, as 

Justice Scalia had in his concurring opinion, that that 

was basically as close as it got. But at most, Mazza 

acknowledged that the decision whether to impose a death 

sentence would be difficult, not an easy one, kind of 

hard, but she simultaneously stated that it was a decision 

that she believed that she could make. She never 

questioned her ability to assess a death sentence in an 

appropriate case. She merely acknowledged that it was a 

decision that she would not take lightly. She also had 

served on another criminal jury in the last couple of 

years, a jury which had returned a guilty verdict. 

In contrast, Rand explicitly questioned his

ability to assess a death sentence in any case. When 

asked whether he could impose the death penalty, he told 

prosecutors right now I say I can, but tomorrow I might 

not. He declined to describe himself as someone who 

believes in the death penalty and can serve as a jury --

juror and assess the death penalty if warranted, stating 

that he was probably in between the first two categories 

described by the prosecutor. 

Notably, Mr. Waxman referred to the prosecutors' 

notes on the questionnaires. What he didn't mention was 

also noted on the -- by the State at -- at the joint 

lodging, page 30, is that Juror Rand had referred to the 

death penalty as a touchy subject and that he had 

described himself as a person falling somewhere in between 

the two categories described by the prosecutor, the first 

being someone who believes in the death penalty and can 

assess it, the second being someone who believes in the 

death penalty generally but cannot personally assess it as 

a juror. So the State did take note of the -- of the 

expressions of ambivalence by Rand during his voir dire.

 Juror Mazza, again, never expressed this level 

of ambivalence. These are not similarly situated jurors.

 And the same is true of Miller-El's attempted 

comparison of Rand and -- and Juror Sandra Hearn. She 

expressed hesitance on assessing the death penalty in a

very particular circumstance, the -- a first offense, and 

certainly this is not the case here. On the other hand, 

Rand had questioned his ability to assess a death penalty 

in any case and, against Hearn's State-friendly views, led 

to a defense challenge that was overruled. And the fact 

that the defense vehemently objected to her on direct 

appeal is further evidence that she's not similarly 

situated.

 Under Batson, Miller-El has the ultimate burden 

of proving purposeful discrimination. He has failed to 

satisfy that burden, and the State trial judge found that 

prosecutors in this case did not act with a discriminatory 

purpose. As this Court acknowledged in its earlier 

opinion, Miller-El is not entitled to habeas relief unless 

he can -- he can show that the State court's rejection of 

his Batson claim was objectively unreasonable. He must 

produce clear and convincing evidence and he has failed to 

do that.

nearly precisely the same brief that it presented to the 

Fifth Circuit the time before. 

Disparate questioning on the minimum punishment 

ploy was objected to by the defense during the voir dire 

and it was acknowledged. If you look at the Batson 

argument, it's either Mr. Macaluso or Mr. Nelson said some 

of the jurors were questioned disparately, but -- and they 

gave the explanation that it had to do with views on the 

death penalty. So it was before the State courts.

 Now, on the graphic script, which is the 

disparate questioning that Ms. Bunn has focused the 

Court's attention on, the State now says, okay, we can't 

speculate about what we don't know about the 

questionnaires. Let's just look at the questionnaires 

that we do know about. Justice Stevens, it is -- you are 

quite right that that tells you nothing about the dozens 

of other white jurors whose questionnaires we don't have, 

but we don't need to indulge in that speculation in this 

case because what we know from the questionnaire answers 

that we have is that every black who expressed anything 

that could be called hesitation on their juror 

questionnaire, including just not filling in either 

question -- answering question 56 or 58, got it. Five 

whites who expressed hesitation did not. That is Juror 

Mazza, Juror Hearn, Juror Duke, Ms. Girard, who testified

that she didn't -- who acknowledged in her voir dire that 

she hadn't filled out one of those questions which got 

similarly situated African American jurors the graphic 

script, and Juror Whaley who -- or Venireman Whaley who 

testified that her questionnaire expressed great 

hesitation about the death penalty. 

And what we also know is that the three jurors 

who got the graphic script, Troy Woods, the black juror; 

Mr. Gutierrez, the Hispanic juror; and Marie Sztybel, the 

only Jewish juror. 

If the Court has no further questions. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:58 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
