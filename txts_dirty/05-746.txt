 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument next

Mr. Phillips.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

The fundamental question in this case is whether 

the common law doctrine of equivalence between defendant 

negligence and plaintiff negligence applies under the 

FELA. The doctrine of equivalence is, I think, most 

clearly stated in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, 

which is reproduced on page 19 of our blue brief in the 

middle paragraph. And I think it is worth taking a 

second to read it. 

The rules which determine the causal relation 

between a plaintiff's negligent conduct and the harm 

resulting to him are the same as those determining the 

causal relation between the defendant's negligent conduct 

and resulting harm to others. That is a principle of law 

that has been in effect long before the Federal Employers 

Liability Act was enacted. It is obviously a restatement 

of the law in 1965, and it is an absolutely clear

statement of the law as it applies today. 

There is nothing in the Federal Employers 

Liability Act that remotely modifies the doctrine of 

equivalence. The two provisions, section 51 talks about 

negligence resulting from -- or negligence in whole or in 

part. And section 53, which describes the contributory 

negligence portion or comparative negligence talks about 

negligence attributable to. None of that deviates at all 

from any kind of common law doctrines. Negligence 

inherently calls for an analysis of proximate causation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that the -- what was it, 

the Rogers case, which said that the -- well, you debate 

whether it said that, but let's assume that it said that 

the rule of proximate causality doesn't apply to the 

negligence of the defendant. 

The basis for that holding was that in whole or in 

part language which is used for the negligence of the 

defendant, but not used for the contributory negligence. 

So if you believe that that case was at least decided for 

the right reason, it seems to me there's a good argument 

that it changed it for the one, but not for the other.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, even if that were true, we 

would still, of course, be entitled to -- I mean, it 

doesn't change the doctrine of equivalence. It doesn't 

say that we're not entitled to the same rule with respect

to the -- our clients --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But nobody does --

MR. PHILLIPS: The plaintiff would be. That 

doctrine is unaffected by that holding. Now, I'd like 

to take issue with the interpretation of Rogers, if you 

want, at this point. But it seems to me the doctrine of 

equivalence is fundamentally different from the doctrine 

of proximate causation. And therefore, you can change one 

without affecting the other one whatsoever.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, the fundamental 

problem, at least for me, in this case is that there was 

no objection at all at trial to the instruction that the 

judge gave on negligence. There was an instruction 

requested by the defendant on contributory negligence, 

which read, "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in 

whole or in part to cause his injury." That was the 

only instruction objected to, because the refusal to 

give that instruction. But you seem to be using that as 

a lever to attack the instruction on negligence to which 

no objection was made.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That's not our attack, Justice 

Ginsburg. Our objection, which is reproduced in 28A of 

the cert -- of the petition's appendix, that says -- and 

I think the current MAI instruction has a different 

causation standard for comparative fault, meaning that

under Missouri's rules, we must prove that such 

negligence of plaintiff directly contributed to the cause 

-- to cause the injury. And that misstates the law, 

because of the doctrine of equivalence. 

That's our initial argument, is that no matter how 

you analyze this, whether you do it from a proximate 

cause or a slightest cause standard as the appropriate 

way to evaluate our negligence, that same standard has to 

be applied in evaluating the plaintiff's negligence. 

That's the core doctrine. That's what we sought 

certiorari on. 

The argument with respect to Rogers was not an 

argument we put into this case, Justice Ginsburg. It's 

an argument that the Respondent put into this case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I take it you would be satisfied 

-- not wholly satisfied, but substantially satisfied if 

we said, yeah, we accept the doctrine of equivalence, and 

we think the instruction on contributory negligence was 

correct. Because that would mean in the next case, you 

would get a proximate cause instruction on defendant's 

negligence.

 MR. PHILLIPS: We would regard that as certainly 

at least half a loaf, maybe more than half a loaf. But 

at the end of the day, I think the right answer in this 

case is that the Court ought to go ahead and decide

whether or not Rogers really did work a sea change in the 

law.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If we came out the way I just 

described --

MR. PHILLIPS: You wouldn't have to address that 

issue.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: We wouldn't have to.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely don't have to address 

that issue. On the other hand, the question is squarely 

presented. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I thought you argued the 

Rogers standard was a correct standard in the Missouri 

court?

 MR. PHILLIPS: We clearly did that, Justice 

Kennedy. And we didn't raise -- we are not here 

complaining about Rogers as an argument for why we 

shouldn't be liable. That's not our -- we're not 

criticizing that. 

What we're saying is, in response to the 

Respondent's argument which seeks to undermine the 

doctrine of equivalence based on an overreading, I would 

argue, of Rogers, that that interpretation is incorrect. 

And if we're right that that interpretation is incorrect, 

we would win on the doctrine of equivalence for two 

different reasons.

The first one that Justice Souter described. And 

the second one would be that to the extent that there's 

any equivalence, there's no problem here because 

proximate cause is required in every case. And we think 

that that's an issue that the Court doesn't have to 

decide, but certainly could. I'm sorry, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, the defendant 

requested a charge on contributory negligence that read, 

"such negligence of plaintiff contributed in whole or in 

part to cause his injuries." You didn't want the direct 

relationship, you didn't ask for that. You asked for one 

that said, "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in 

whole or in part to his injury." Now you are saying that 

that was -- what you asked for was an incorrect charge.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, what we're saying, Justice 

Ginsburg, is that we were entitled to the same -- if they 

were going to use slight negligence with respect to our 

negligence, then with respect to the plaintiff's 

negligence, we were entitled to slight negligence as 

well. 

That's our fundamental argument. That's the issue 

we have put on the table. And candidly, I don't think 

there's an answer to that that's been offered in this 

case, other than a harmless error argument, which I think 

is candidly without substance.

The issue, then, is whether in evaluating the 

doctrine of equivalence, do you want to then entertain 

the plaintiff's or the Respondent's counter argument, 

which is that somehow Rogers requires this fundamental 

change, and indeed overrules the doctrine of equivalence 

as it applies to FELA. 

And I would say, one, Rogers doesn't speak to the 

doctrine of equivalence at all. And, two, to the extent 

it does speak to it, it was never meant to change the 

fundamental rule with respect to proximate causation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Except we've rejected petitions 

for certiorari on that issue at least a couple of times. 

Eleven circuits are in agreement as to what Rogers 

required. You --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, at least one circuit clearly.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you really expect to get five 

votes for the railroad on this, what would be a massive 

change of what is assumed to be the law for, what, 50 

years?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the -- well, the 

answer is yes, of course, I expect to get five votes for 

that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you were wise enough not to 

ask for that.

MR. PHILLIPS: But you know, the basic -- the 

point here is that if you look at the decisions that have 

analyzed this Court's opinion in Rogers, I don't think 

any of them has analyzed it with much care. And the 

reality is the Third Circuit has analyzed this case with 

care, and reached the opposite conclusion. 

We think there is a split in the circuits. And at 

some point, if not through this vehicle to address that 

issue, then through another vehicle to address that 

issue. But, yes, it seems reasonably clear that, first 

of all, there were at least 20 decisions of this Court 

dealing not only with the sufficiency evidence, but also 

with the adequacy of the jury instructions prior to 

Rogers that refer specifically to proximate causation. 

There is nothing in the statute that remotely 

meant to change that. There is nothing that's been 

identified in that context. It is at least clear to me, 

and I hope clear to five of you --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Rogers said, in whole or in part. 

Now, I agree with you, that I don't see how that does it. 

But Rogers said that it did it.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But what Rogers saying in whole or 

in part eliminated was the specific proximate causation 

standard existing in Missouri. And Missouri's proximate 

cause standard talked about sole causation. And this

Court said, no, in whole or in part means sole causation 

can not be the right standard for proximate cause. 

The Court was not asked to decide, and I don't 

think it did decide, that proximate causation, as it is 

traditionally understood, was also thrown out the door, 

or more fundamentally, that you can never ask for a jury 

instruction that calls for proximate causation to be 

given to both parties -- I'm sorry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Phillips, I may be 

lost a bit here. But I mean, which -- I'm looking at the 

instructions that were given. And it seems to me it is 

hard to take issue with the instruction on the railroad's 

part because it tracks the statutory language. The 

statute says in whole or in part, and the instruction 

says in whole or in part. 

So if you're pushing the doctrine of equivalence, 

your objection seems to be to the directly contributed 

language with respect to the employee, the plaintiff. 

Now, but doesn't directly contributed, isn't that a 

typical proximate cause instruction?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, that is a typical proximate 

cause instruction, and that meant that our burden was 

heavier than the plaintiff's burden, which is why we're 

saying that under the doctrine of equivalence, we're 

entitled to the equivalent instructions. Whatever they

are. If it is slight cause or proximate cause.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. But on the other 

hand, you're also arguing in favor of proximate cause. You 

are saying Rogers didn't change proximate cause.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But we are only doing that 

in response to the Respondent's argument. I'm not -- we 

didn't bring to this Court an affirmative argument that 

said we are entitled to no liability because of proximate 

cause. That's not the argument we made. The argument --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: How is the blue brief in 

response to Respondent's argument?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Because if you look at the 

opposition to the cert petition, which took us to task 

for not discussing Rogers in our petition, it says on 

page 6, "inexplicably, petitioner does not cite, let 

alone discuss Rogers, an omission that enfeebles its 

entire discussion of FELA's causation standards." 

Against that kind of an attack, we felt it 

incumbent on us to deal with Rogers.

 JUSTICE BREYER: As we're supposed to decide the 

case, in your view, there was instruction 13. 

Instruction 13 used the word direct.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You object to 13. You said it 

should use the word in whole or in part.

then you say you've argued that here. So what you're 

saying is now we're supposed to decide, should 

instruction 13 use the word in whole or in part. That's 

what it is. 

I have to admit, I didn't quite get that out of 

the blue brief. I thought you were arguing something 

else about railroad negligence. But you're not now, you 

say, arguing about railroad negligence. You're arguing 

about plaintiff negligence.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, we're arguing both.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So if I reread the 

blue brief, what I'll discover on closer examination, 

that your real objection, not responding to the other 

side, has simply been about the standard to use in 

respect to plaintiff's contributory negligence. And what 

you want this Court to say is, you're right about that, 

we want the more relaxed standard used for contributory 

negligence. End of case.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, it does say that in the blue 

brief. Because what we say is that the doctrine 

of equivalence is the principle that should apply. And 

you know, it is not specifically before the Court whether 

that means slight cause or proximate cause.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I would say it sure is before the 

Court, because what we are considering before the Court 

is your objection to instruction 13. And you said it 

should use the words in whole or in part. And I have to 

admit, I don't know why it shouldn't. But I'll have to 

ask them that.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That's fair.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You're going to say yes. 

So all this other stuff is quite extraneous about whether 

-- the railroad standard of negligence, the railroad 

should be in a relaxed standard of negligence, in whole 

or in part.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know that it's --

JUSTICE BREYER: Causation.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know that it's extraneous. 

It clearly is not something that the Court needs to 

decide. On the other hand, it is something that the 

Respondents, to my mind at least, put into the case. And 

then we responded, to be sure, somewhat aggressively in 

urging the Court to rethink whether Rogers was right --

whether Rogers really decided this issue as some courts 

of appeals have.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Perhaps my memory is faulty, 

but as I recall your opening brief, many pages were 

devoted to what instruction should have been given on 

railroad negligence. You were dealing not simply with 

what seems to be the question presented, that is, was the 

instruction on contributory negligence wrong, because it 

said -- it didn't use the in whole or in part language. 

Instead it said directly caused. 

So that's the limit of what we can deal with, 

whether the in whole or in part should have been in the 

contributory negligence. But it was your brief that 

spent a lot of time talking about the proper standard for 

the railroad's negligence.

 MR. PHILLIPS: There is no question about that, 

Justice Ginsburg. But the point is that we made both 

arguments. And they are in some ways intertwined, in 

part because so much of the doctrine of equivalence 

itself is based on proximate cause as the standard. And 

so if you go back and look at all of the common law 

analyses here, which are the predicate --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you didn't object to the 

charge that was given on negligence. You didn't object 

to the in whole or in part. So that should be out of the

case.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Except to the extent that the 

Respondents are asking you to interpret Rogers as a 

mechanism for getting at the doctrine of equivalence. 

Now, it seems to me you can answer that in one of two 

ways. 

You can say simply, as I said to Justice Scalia, 

Rogers doesn't speak to the doctrine of equivalence, and 

therefore, you don't have to entertain that, you should 

just reaffirm a doctrine that every court except the 

courts in Missouri have recognized for a very long time. 

Or alternatively, you can say, well, look, they say that 

in order to properly analyze the doctrine of equivalence, 

you should examine whether or not Rogers worked a sea 

change in the law. 

And we took them up on that argument, and said, we 

don't think it did. And that if it didn't work a sea 

change in the law, then there is no basis at all for 

doubting that you would grant equivalent instructions in 

these two cases. And that's the guidance you would give 

to the lower courts on remand. Because this case would 

have to go back for a new trial.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're not taking them up on 

any argument when you spent half your brief arguing about 

what the proper standard was for the railroad's

negligence.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I would add to that that we 

don't usually look at a BIO to see the issues that the 

Petitioner is presenting.

 MR. PHILLIPS: And you know, Justice Kennedy, I 

understand that. But the reality is we raised the 

doctrine of equivalence as our question presented. The 

other side raises and uses a substantial amount of its 

pages for the issue of the meaning of Rogers. We answer 

that in the reply brief. The Court grants certiorari. 

We decided under those circumstances that the sensible 

way to proceed was to address the Rogers issue. 

Now, to be sure, I suppose we could have said, 

here's -- section one is the doctrine of equivalence. 

That's a 10 page brief. Maybe the better way to do it is 

just write a 15 page brief, wait for their 47 page brief 

on Rogers, and then 20 pages on Rogers. 

But we anticipated that they were going to do 

precisely what they did, which is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you would have us 

announce a decision on the doctrine of equivalence 

without saying which way it should be made equivalent? 

Raising the railroad's standard or lowering the 

employee's?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, because -- courts of appeals

have been doing that for years. There have been a lot --

you know, a lot of them assume that there's a lower 

standard, and they say that the doctrine of equivalence 

requires that if the plaintiff gets to go with slight 

cause, then the defendant gets slight cause. So that's a 

ruling that's been rendered for years and years. 

Is that the most sensible way? I don't know. I 

think it would make sense for this Court to address the 

more fundamental issue of Rogers. Because I think it is 

an important issue that needs to be decided. I don't 

think the Court needs to decide it. I do think it has 

been thoroughly vetted for the Court on both sides, and 

it would certainly provide significant guidance to the 

lower courts.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, may I ask you this 

question. Assuming you're right on the doctrine of 

equivalence and you're wrong on proximate cause, for the 

moment. Now, you said earlier in your argument, it is 

perfectly clear there was no harmless error here.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seemed to me that a possible 

interpretation of the record -- and I'd like you to comment 

of the record -- is that the jury either believed the one --

one truck driver or the other. And that the direct causation 

thing really didn't have an impact on the calculation of

damages. 

And I was going to ask you to comment on that and 

to tell me whether during the argument of the case before 

the jury, did the plaintiff's lawyer argue, in effect, 

that he had -- the railroad has a much heavier burden of 

proving a causation than we do?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Let me take the first question 

first, and then I'll address the second one. There were 

three theories that the plaintiff put forward of the 

negligence of the railroad. Not just that the one driver 

drove the other driver off the side of the road. There 

was also a claim that the road wasn't constructed 

properly, and there was a claim that he wasn't given 

adequate safety instructions. 

And there's no way, given that this was a general 

verdict, to remotely figure out which of those theories 

was the one the jury thought was correct, and how that 

theory might line up with a causation theory, based on 

the plaintiff's own particular view and the defendant's 

arguments in this particular case. 

So it is not as cut and dried as he said, he said, 

and that's it. They were more theories in it. And you 

know, if you accept the idea that jury instructions 

count, and there's clearly a very different burden that's 

imposed on one as opposed to the other, then it seems to

me the answer is there's no way for the Court to make a 

harmless error determination. 

It is also a question of State law. It ought to 

be decided by the Missouri courts in the first instance 

in any event, I would think, rather than this Court 

trying to sort through the record. 

With respect to the argument at the close of 

the case, I don't remember any specific arguments that 

either side made with respect to the burdens, because the 

jury instructions were what they were. And I think each 

side was saying, you know, we really didn't do anything 

wrong. And so that's basically the way that it was 

presented. 

But I think given the way the jury instructions 

played out, that there's no way at this time to 

unscramble that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I think I'm seeing now, I think 

the structure of your brief is -- perhaps a gloss put on 

it, but saying this: Look, we objected to the 

contributory negligence instruction on the ground that it 

couldn't be different from the direct instruction -- from 

the railroad instruction. And we said they should be the 

same and they should both be in whole or in part.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And we now want you to say that

the refusal of the court to do that was wrong, because it 

violated the equivalence. But as soon as you do that, 

you're going to have to think about what the right 

standard should be for a new trial.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And if you stop there, probably, 

they will put the in whole or in part, but that's not the 

right standard.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And if you really think about it, 

you will see that the one we didn't ask for, but the one 

that the court gave, is the right standard and should 

have been given in the other case, too. Now, we wouldn't 

have to say that.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But you're saying unless you say 

that, you're not going to give proper instruction to what 

happens in the future. Now --

MR. PHILLIPS: You know, that's --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now let's think back for a minute 

on the merits.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE BREYER: How could it be wrong? How could 

it be wrong to have instructed the jury with the in whole 

or in part language for the railroad, since that's the

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think if we were entitled 

to go back to the trial court, and if the issue was 

what's the proper instruction, we would have asked for 

and we should have properly received a proximate cause 

instruction. And that's what -- that's the question that 

will be at issue on the remand.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What possible -- you have two 

sides. One, you write a proximate cause instruction in 

whatever language you like.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The other side submits a proposed 

instruction with in whole or in part. I'm a trial 

judge. I've never heard of this case, kind of case 

before. I just was appointed. I read the statute. And 

I say, well, here, theirs says what the statute says, and 

yours doesn't. I'll play it safe. I'll go with the 

statute. All right? Now, how could that be an error?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it is not a correct statement 

of the law.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Is the answer.

said it is not a correct statement of the law?

explain to the jury what decisionmaking it has to go 

through in order to evaluate this case. I mean, it is 

true, it is not an incorrect statement in the sense that 

there's nothing wrong with it. But it is not an adequate 

statement because it doesn't deal, it is not sufficient, 

it doesn't deal with the proximate cause issue. I mean, 

it seems to me --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Phillips, may I interrupt on 

exactly the point that I think you're addressing with 

Justice Breyer? As I understand your argument, you're 

saying one view of Rogers is that the in whole or in part 

language eliminates the proximate cause instruction. We 

all agree that that is one view of Rogers.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it also does something else. 

And I don't think we disagree about that either. It 

specifically instructs the jury that multiple causation 

may be present. And if it is, if the defendant is at 

least one, the source of one of those causes under Rogers 

even slightly --

MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that that will suffice. The 

problem I have with -- in a way with your response to 

Justice Breyer, and the problem that I have with the 

instruction that your side requested on contributory

negligence is this: It seems to me that the in whole or 

in part language would be wrong on contributory 

negligence, or at least it would be very misleading, for 

the simple reason that you never get to contributory 

negligence unless you found the defendant was negligent 

in the first place.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And therefore, if the plaintiff 

is also negligent, it will necessarily be in part. It 

couldn't be wholly or in part. If it were wholly 

negligent, you would never have found the defendant was 

negligent in the first place.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So that to the extent the 

instruction addresses multiple causation, it would be 

misleading to the jury, and it would assume a possibility 

that couldn't happen. Therefore, if you are not going to 

mislead the jury on multiple causation when you instruct 

on contributory negligence, you've got to have some other 

way of addressing the proximate cause language. Is that 

analysis right or wrong?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think it is wrong on two 

levels. One is, I don't know why you would need to have 

proximate cause as your fallback, the last comment you 

just made, because it seems to me if you're saying slight

cause, which is what Missouri thinks the in whole or in 

part means, then you can just say slight cause when 

you're describing the contributory negligence.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But the instruction that your 

side asked for, as I understand it, was not a slight 

cause instruction, it was an in whole or in part 

instruction.

 MR. PHILLIPS: What we asked for was an 

equivalence.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, and that -- all right. But 

if you're asking for the in whole or in part instruction 

on contributory negligence, it seems to me the judge has 

got to have been correct in saying no to that, because to 

the extent that it addresses multiple causation, it would 

be addressing a problem that couldn't even occur in 

contributory negligence which will always be in part.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That was not the basis on which the 

judge rejected it. He didn't reject it on the basis --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe that was not the 

basis on which he rejected it, but if -- we've got to 

consider it in deciding whether to reverse it.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the point here that remains 

is we said we are entitled to an equivalent instruction. 

Now, if there's some variant of that, we could certainly 

argue about that.

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that's not what he said. He 

said equivalence instruction was not on multiple 

causation. It was the equivalence instruction on either 

proximate cause or not proximate cause. It was the 

causation issue, it was the proximate causation issue, 

not the multiple causation issue that concerned you, 

right?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that is the specific issue in 

this case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They don't have to have 

proximate, we don't have to have proximate.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. That's our argument.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But because the 

instruction addresses both, in one view, proximate cause 

and multiple cause, it would have been misleading so far 

as the multiple cause issue was concerned, and a request 

for an instruction in whole or in part on contributory 

negligence really should have been denied. Is that 

correct?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well -- I think -- I think the 

argument would be that that cuts it too fine, candidly. 

I think you can make an argument that what, you know, 

what we were entitled to was some variant. And that --

our objection here is not --

MR. PHILLIPS: The slightest cause.

prove proximate cause.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's your basic argument.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That's our basic argument.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. PHILLIPS: And we didn't get that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And I don't think you could have 

gotten where you want to go with the instruction that 

your side requested, which was an in whole or in part 

instruction. That's my only point.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it may be that the in whole 

part of this may have been slightly misleading, although 

I think you can make an argument that you can end up with 

in whole on both sides as a conceptual matter. But 

that's not the -- that wasn't the complaint at trial. It 

wasn't the basis for the trial judge's decision, wasn't 

the basis for the court of appeals decision. 

If the Court wants to send it back and say, is 

there another objection to this instruction, that's fine. 

But it seems to me, this Court ought to address this 

issue in the way it has been presented.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY L. PERRY

 ON BEHALF OF THE Respondent

 MS. PERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 

the Court: 

The controlling question raised here is whether 

instruction 13 accurately states Federal law. That's 

exactly what petitioner said in their reply brief to the 

Missouri Court of Appeals. They could not have been any 

clearer that their challenge was to instruction 13. In 

John versus Poulin, this Court said that State courts

have the authority to prescribe the rules of procedure in 

their courts even when Federal issues are at stake. 

The requirements in the Missouri courts were not 

complied with here. No abstract question was presented. 

The sole question presented and preserved was with 

respect to instruction 13. And that can again be seen in 

their opening brief in the Missouri Court of Appeals, 

which specifically says the trial court erred in giving 

instruction 13 based on MAI 32.07(b).

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is the question whether 

instruction 13 is flawed viewed in isolation, or whether 

it is flawed when it's viewed together with the 

instruction on employer negligence?

 MS. PERRY: It is viewed in conjunction with the 

instruction on employer negligence, but a fixed concept 

of what it was, they did not challenge the language of 

instruction 12. They accepted that. Holding that 

language constant, what should we do to instruction 13? 

They could have objected to instruction 12 and 13, 

and they could have said, here are a pair of instructions 

both in proximate cause, and here are a pair of 

instructions both in -- resulting in whole or in part, 

and then they could have preserved this issue. But they 

did not do that. They accepted instruction 12 as a 

correct statement of the law, and said, now let's look at

instruction 13.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But do you agree that they set out 

different causation standards, 12 and 13?

 MS. PERRY: Yes, they do. Rogers concluded that 

50 years ago and the courts in the Federal and State 

system have nearly uniformly interpreted Rogers as 

reaching that decision.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So if the causation standards are 

in fact the same, then instruction 13 is defective; isn't 

that right?

 MS. PERRY: Yes, if you can reach that decision 

without interpreting instruction 12, or the propriety of 

instruction 12, particularly since instruction 12 

contained the exact language of the statute. Whatever 

judicial gloss has been put on that language was not told 

to the jury. 

Justice Stevens, the question you asked, whether 

there was any argument about the different standards, the 

answer is no. There was no argument. The only way in 

which the jury learned of this difference was in the 

language of the instruction. And instruction 12 --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you this question, if 

I may. Perhaps I should have asked Mr. Phillips. Is 

there such an animal as the doctrine of equivalence? I 

understand the restatement describes what the plaintiff's

burden is on proving causation, and then it says the same 

rules apply to defendant's contributory negligence. 

But that doesn't sound to me like any overriding 

doctrine of equivalence. It just says when they wrote 

the restatement, the rules were the same. Is there such 

a thing as the doctrine of equivalence?

 MS. PERRY: There wasn't in the early 1900s for 

certain, Your Honor, because at that time, even 

petitioners recognized the doctrine was emerging. And if 

we look at the language of 53, it talks about the type of 

contributory negligence that used to be a bar. And that 

certainly was a type of contributory negligence that only 

arose with the traditional proximate cause. It certainly 

wasn't on the slightest cause standard.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't there have 

to be a doctrine of equivalence when you're running a 

comparative negligence regime? Because, you know, you 

talk about the plaintiff's negligence causing the harm to 

a certain degree and the defendant's negligence causing 

it to a certain degree. And if you're not dealing with 

apples and apples, it seems to me you can't conduct the 

comparison.

 MS. PERRY: No, Your Honor. You can conduct the 

comparison, and it happens all the time in cases where 

one party has committed intentional misconduct and

another party has had negligent misconduct. The 

causation standards are different in that instance. 

There's a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. But we're talking 

about comparative negligence here, where there's 

negligence on both sides. And I just don't know how you 

say one party's 20 percent -- contributed 20 percent to 

the harm and the other 80 percent, if you're using 

different causation standards.

 MS. PERRY: Well, the causation standard is used 

to decide what negligence you use in the balance and in 

the comparison. For example, if a party is negligent, 

but the negligence had no causative effect, that 

negligence falls out of the analysis.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but your example of other 

instances including having to compare a defendant who did 

the tort intentionally with negligent -- contributory 

negligence, that's not what we have here. We have here a 

difference in the causation. Intentional or 

non-intentional has nothing to do with causation. 

But once you say that there's a difference in the 

causation, it seems to me you cannot compare the two. 

You cannot compare the two sensibly, unless you are using 

the same kind of a standard. 

I mean, let's assume that you find that the

railroad did not directly, but nonetheless caused the 

injury to some extent, but the defendant was directly 

contributory to it. What do I do? Do I add another 40 

percent to his culpability because it was -- his 

causation was more direct than the plaintiff's causation?

 MS. PERRY: No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not?

 MS. PERRY: It just affects which negligence was 

in the balance. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, it doesn't. It certainly 

bears considerably upon the culpability of the two, it 

seems to me.

 MS. PERRY: Well, in responding -- going back to 

your question about intentional conduct, the petitioner's 

reply brief, in fact, states that a broader range of 

harms are considered proximately caused by intentional 

torts. So there is a different conception of proximate 

cause in that context. 

But in any event, their merits brief consistently 

argues for a proximate cause standard. In fact, it 

closes with that. And its criticism of instruction 13 in 

this case was precisely that it was a proximate cause 

standard. So if they are now before this Court asking 

for a proximate cause standard, they conceded that 

instruction 13 was a proximate cause standard, they in

fact complained about it precisely because it was a 

proximate cause standard, that issue really isn't before 

this Court anymore.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have any 

conceptual difficulty with adding in whole or in part to 

instruction 13, which is the employee's instruction, 

because it's comparative negligence. It seems to me that 

necessarily implies in whole or in part. If you can 

reduce his recovery because he's in part negligent, what 

would be wrong with saying in whole or in part in 

instruction 13?

 MS. PERRY: Well, I think Justice Souter hit the 

nail on the head on that one, in that it does create 

confusion and it can mislead the jury that the railroad 

worker is responsible for other parties' culpability as 

well. Moreover --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. I thought Justice 

Souter's point was that taking it out of the railroad's 

instruction might cause confusion because of it. But I 

don't see how adding it to both of them when you're 

dealing with comparative negligence, and it's necessarily 

the case that partial negligence on either of their parts 

can enter into the verdict, I don't see how that can be 

confusing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Answer the question, Justice 

Souter. Yes or no.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The point that I was trying to 

make about it being misleading is that if you use the in 

whole or in part language for a contributory negligence 

instruction, you are misleading the jury into thinking 

that at least there might be whole contributory 

negligence. There never will be. You don't get the 

contributory negligence unless you've already found the 

defendant was negligent, at least to some degree. 

Therefore, if the plaintiff is negligent, it can only be 

in part. That's all I was trying to say.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under that scenario, then, 

what objection could there be to a recognition that the 

negligence of the plaintiff can contribute in part to the 

accident?

 MS. PERRY: If petitioner had asked for an 

instruction that said directly contributed in part, the 

inclusion of the phrase in part there might not have any 

impact. It could still potentially mislead the jury, but 

they were seeking not just to add the words "resulting in 

whole or in part," but remove the word "directly" because 

it connoted proximate cause, and that they felt proximate

cause was not the appropriate standard for contributory 

negligence, even though now that is the standard that 

they solely are seeking.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, two things you might 

comment on. First, the in whole or in part, you might 

take account of the fact that there are other negligent 

actors, third parties, who have contributed to the injury 

to the employee. 

Secondly, Section 53 does not contain the language 

in whole or in part.

 MS. PERRY: Absolutely, Your Honor. It does not. 

In section --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's what Justice 

Souter has identified, right? That's not because they're 

adopting different standards.

 MS. PERRY: I disagree, Your Honor. I think it is 

because they are adopting different standards. The 

contributory negligence --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you just told me, a 

good reason for not putting in whole or in part in 

instruction 13 is because it doesn't make sense, the 

whole part doesn't make sense with contributory 

negligence. That's a good reason not to put it in 

Section 53 either.

is that it's a different standard. In Section 53, 

they're talking about contributory negligence that was a 

bar to liability. That type of contributory negligence 

was the kind that was more than -- it wasn't caused by 

slight causation. It required proximate cause. That was 

a pretty harsh result. 

And it certainly didn't arise in instances where 

the plaintiff had just had the slightest causal 

connection. And that certainly was the conclusion in 

Rogers.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, no, no. May I pick you up 

on that? Because there's a point at which you and I are 

disagreeing about Rogers. And in all candor, I think 

it's because you are ignoring one part of Rogers, and if 

I'm wrong, I want you to tell me. You quote the 

slightest bit language from Rogers on both page 26 and 33 

of your brief. And you take that as being language that 

eliminates the proximate cause requirement. 

What you don't include in your quotation is the 

footnote in Justice Brennan's opinion following that 

slightest cause language. And the footnote was to a 

citation, the citation was to the Coray case. The 

opinion in Coray was written by Justice Douglas and --

I'm sorry, Justice Black. And in the very language that 

Justice Black used, he said expressly that if proximate

cause is shown, there can be recovery. 

Now, given the fact that in Rogers, the very 

citation to the language which you say eliminated the 

proximate cause requirement cited a case in which 

proximate cause was part of the very sentence relied on, 

I don't see how you can read Rogers -- maybe later cases, 

but I don't see how you can read Rogers as eliminating 

the proximate cause requirement. 

And therefore, I think you have to read Rogers as 

addressing the issue of multiple causation, not proximate 

causation. Now, am I going wrong there somewhere?

 MS. PERRY: I have two responses, Your Honor. 

First, Justice Brennan wrote Crane twelve years later.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Absolutely right.

 MS. PERRY: And he, you know, definitely clearly 

said that a railroad worker does not have to prove common 

law proximate causation relying on Rogers.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: He did, but he was also pointing 

out, just to make it simpler, he was pointing out in 

Crane that the liability arose in Crane out of -- I 

forget the full name of it -- the Appliance Act. And the 

Appliance Act had its own set of standards. And 

therefore, you cannot, from an Appliance Act case, you 

cannot infer anything one way or the other about the 

general standard in FELA. And to make it even more

complicated, as I recall, Rogers was an Appliance case, 

too, but he didn't get into that there. 

But my only point is, you are right about the 

two Brennan opinions, Rogers and the -- Crane. But given 

the fact that it was an Appliance case, I don't think you 

can infer one thing or another about an ultimate FELA 

standard in the absence of an Appliance action. 

What remains is that the citation in Rogers was to 

Coray, and Coray spoke about there still being proximate 

cause.

 MS. PERRY: Yes. But if we look at those earlier 

cases, particularly Coray, we can see that Rogers 

articulated what was meant by that proximate cause 

language. Proximate cause is, in a sense, a label for 

scope of liability or legal cause, as the restatement 

says. It doesn't have any singular conception. And in 

Coray, the Court found --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it is understood by 

everybody, isn't it, that at least it has the conception 

which is captured by using the word "direct" as in 

instruction 13, and at least it has that core of meaning 

whenever it is used, doesn't it? 

In other words, it may not have a lot of bells and 

whistles associated with it in the prior law, but at 

least it requires some direct causation as opposed to

indirect, right?

 MS. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. And that's -- I don't know 

that Justice Brennan's citation to Coray, or Coray's use 

of the language carries you any further than that. But 

that's as far as Mr. Phillips wants to go.

 MS. PERRY: We don't accept that, but even if 

that's the case, the Rogers -- the parties to Rogers 

immediately interpreted that decision as affecting 

proximate cause. Twelve years later, this Court did say 

that in Crane. The lower courts have uniformly, nearly 

uniformly interpreted Rogers in a certain way. And at 

this point, stare decisis suggests that this Court should 

not overrule.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That may be. That may be. But 

it seems to me that that's a different argument from 

saying Rogers requires it, because I don't think you can 

get that out of Rogers.

 MS. PERRY: Well, and I also think, though, that 

by lightening -- by saying the slightest cause possible 

or, you know, a slight cause would create liability, that 

does affect proximate cause.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't have to say 

that. I mean, you know, when in doubt, we ought to 

follow the words of the statute. And so whole or in part

makes sense with the railroad, but directly doesn't 

appear in Section 53. Why don't we just -- why shouldn't 

the instruction just say, "such negligence of the 

plaintiff contributed to cause his injury." It's not 

going to be a complete bar because we know the 

immediate -- the next instruction talks about reducing 

the award by the amount of the negligence. Why wouldn't 

that be preferable to introducing extraneous terms?

 MS. PERRY: Because Section 53 refers to 

contributory negligence that created a bar. And that was 

the type of negligence that required proximate cause. 

Moreover, the type of instruction you are positing is not 

at all what petitioner requested in this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, but he requested 

that the instructions be the same, and the directly is 

what causes the problem, and directly doesn't appear in 

the statute.

 MS. PERRY: But under Missouri procedures, you 

have to be clear in the nature of your objection, and the 

objection was that we want the same language, we want the 

language resulting in whole or in part. 

And out of respect for the State courts and their 

right to create the rules that govern in those courts, 

that was not satisfactory under Missouri rules. Missouri 

rules also have specific requirements for what you have

to do in the court of appeals. There's a "Point Relied 

On" which is the argument heading in the brief, and it's 

required by Rule 84.04. And it sets forth a very 

specific format, and it's supposed to start with "The 

trial court erred in," and then you give your reasons. 

And it says that negligence -- it erred in 

instructing the jury to find plaintiff negligent only if 

it concluded that his negligence directly contributed to 

cause his injury, rather than cause his injury in whole 

or in part. 

You know, there is no issue that was preserved in 

the Missouri courts other than that challenge. Cook 

versus Caldwell which we cite in our brief, in Missouri, 

not only do you have to object, but you have to keep 

consistent with the basis of the objection. You can't 

just object to instruction 13 on one ground, go up to the 

court of appeals, and raise a completely different 

challenge to instruction 13. You have to stay 

consistent. And out of respect --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think they raised 

an objection based on the doctrine of equivalence?

 MS. PERRY: That was a justification for rewriting 

instruction 13 to include the words "resulting in whole 

or in part." I do not think they raised an abstract 

argument about equivalency; that in order to do that,

they would have had to object to instruction 12 and 

instruction 13, because equivalency in the abstract would 

require modification of both instructions, and they 

clearly chose to accept the language of instruction 12 

and only object to instruction 13. 

So no, not in the abstract, it hasn't been raised. 

It was a justification for one particular result, and 

that was a result that would have modified instruction 

13. And in a particular way, too, modified it in a way 

of including the words "resulting in whole or in part."

 JUSTICE BREYER: I guess they want to make the 

argument now, whether they did or not, that if we look at 

Section 53, which I think is the part dealing with 

contributory negligence. I don't see anything else. It 

doesn't speak of causation at all.

 MS. PERRY: Exactly, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It just says if there's some 

contributory negligence, the damages will be diminished 

according to the negligence attributable to the employee. 

So I take it their argument was, maybe with 

hindsight, Judge, don't give this direct language, 

because nothing requires it. And since, other things 

being equal, nothing requires it, you ought to give the 

same language you gave for the other side. 

And they said the judge rejected that argument, so

accepted it. And all the rest of what he's saying is 

just in case the Court wants to reach it, or something 

like that. But what about that one?

 MS. PERRY: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Could you --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, should we answer 

the question he now -- perhaps in his minimalist 

position -- might want to raise, or maybe did, that 

Section 53 doesn't speak of causation, the judge gave a 

causation instruction. The judge's causation instruction 

in their view was wrong, and the law requires the judge's 

causation instruction on contributory negligence, if 

there is one, to be the same as it was on direct, the 

defendant's negligence. And he says that isn't what 

happened, we objected to it, we produced arguments, one 

of them was this equivalence thing.

 So he's saying to us: Decide it, say that they 

were wrong. What's your view of that?

 MS. PERRY: We disagree with petitioner.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not surprised. 

(Laughter.)

 MS. PERRY: The abstract question of equivalency 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. That's just an argument.

JUSTICE BREYER: It was not, but they say, 

nonetheless, we did object that this instruction was 

wrong. One reason it was wrong is because it speaks of 

causation differently than when they spoke of causation 

in respect to the railroad. We thought that was a reason 

why it was wrong then. We think that's a reason why it 

is wrong now, and we would like the Missouri court, but 

they wouldn't do it, so we want you to say it was wrong 

for that reason.

 MS. PERRY: Well, I think we're in a difficult 

position right now, because they're asking for proximate 

cause in their blue brief --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, we say, well, we'll abandon 

all that, that's just a series of different arguments 

that we'd like the Court to say.

 MS. PERRY: Okay. If we're putting aside the blue 

brief then --

JUSTICE BREYER: If you read it carefully, you'll 

see it, basically. 

(Laughter.)

 MS. PERRY: But if the question goes to the fact 

that Section 53 doesn't have an express causation 

standard in it, what you fall back on is traditional 

proximate cause, that Congress departed from the 

traditional proximate cause standard by using the words

"resulting in whole or in part" in Section 51. It didn't 

create the same departure in Section 53. 

In fact, by referring to the kind of contributory 

negligence that creates a bar, it was pretty much 

pointing right back to proximate cause.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you have more than one 

proximate cause?

 MS. PERRY: I believe the treatises that say yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course. So then how can "in 

whole or in part" possibly eliminate the proximate cause 

requirement, because it could be in part and still be a 

proximate cause. How can that language possibly be 

interpreted to eliminate the proximate cause requirement?

 MS. PERRY: Because when a cause that -- when a 

slightest cause can give rise to liability, that has 

effectively reduced or relaxed that causation standard. 

There is still a legal cause requirement, yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it could be the slightest 

direct cause, which is Justice Scalia's point.

 MS. PERRY: Well, but if we look at like the first 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Now, it may mislead the jury if 

that's all you say. But as a matter of analyzing the 

statute or even of analyzing what the Court meant in 

Rogers, you can have a slight but direct cause, and that

would be proximate cause in the traditional analysis; 

isn't that so?

 MS. PERRY: Well, no. The Restatement, for 

example, at the time of Rogers talked about substantial 

factors, and talked, in other words --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How can you say no when you 

acknowledge that the prior law when there was 

contributory negligence used to require proximate cause 

for both the negligence of the defendant and for the 

contributory negligence of the defendant? Such a 

situation could not exist unless proximate cause doesn't 

have to be the sole cause. It can be just the cause in 

part, right?

 MS. PERRY: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So the mere fact that we had 

contributory negligence statutes that were applying 

proximate cause requirements demonstrates that a 

proximate cause can be a cause in part.

 MS. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor, but what Rogers and 

the statute recognizes that it can be a very, very slight 

cause. And what it was understood, for example, in the 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what Rogers might 

have said, but the statute doesn't say anything about 

slight cause. It only says in whole or in part.

MS. PERRY: And neither did the instruction. It 

just used the words "resulting in whole or in part" also. 

But Rogers did interpret the language "resulting in whole 

or in part" as meaning playing any part, even the 

slightest. And that has been the law for 50 years. And 

it would be a massive change in the law, as Justice 

Scalia said earlier, for this Court to depart from that 

at this point in time.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't seem to me that slight 

is the opposite of proximate. It could be a slight 

proximate cause.

 MS. PERRY: The Restatement at the time of Rogers 

talked about substantial factors, and in the comment to 

that, it explains that sometimes the other causes can be 

so predominant that one causation is just not 

sufficiently significant or of sufficient quantum to 

constitute a legal cause. 

So there is a component of quantity within the 

concepts of proximate cause. I believe their reply brief 

talks about substantial factor, and to talk about 

something as being a substantial factor does have a 

quantum component to it, just as slight has a quantum 

component to it. A slight cause could not be a 

substantial factor, or oftentimes would not be a 

substantial factor. So the two really do go hand in

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But under the old rule that 

plaintiff's negligence in whatever degree was an absolute 

bar to recovery, wasn't the rule customarily stated that 

plaintiff's negligence, however slight, was a total bar 

to recovery?

 MS. PERRY: I'm not aware of that, Your Honor. It 

may be.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I thought it was. I may be wrong 

about that.

 MS. PERRY: I am not aware of that. So that would 

be a pretty harsh remedy if that were the case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's what I thought. Yes, I 

thought it was a pretty harsh rule.

 MS. PERRY: And clearly, Congress in this statute 

was trying to move away from the common law in many 

respects to protect the railroad worker. And the 

interpretation of Section 51 as lightening the causation 

standard for the defendant's negligence, but leaving 

intact the traditional proximate cause standard for 

plaintiff's contributory negligence completely comports 

with the purpose of Congress in enacting the statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't "in whole or in 

part" simply the logical corollary of introducing 

comparative negligence? Why do you have to read that as

departing from proximate cause, instead of simply 

recognizing that under 53, negligence on the part of the 

employee can reduce recovery which -- without barring it?

 MS. PERRY: I reach that conclusion on the basis 

of Rogers. And in the petitioner's brief --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Beyond that, if the plaintiff's 

negligence was in whole the cause of the action, then the 

-- there was no reason to get to comparative negligence 

or contributory negligence, because by hypothesis, there 

would have been no negligence by the defendant.

 MS. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's why you don't have 

"in whole or in part" in 53, not because they wanted to 

depart from proximate cause there, but because, as 

Justice Stevens pointed out, you wouldn't have it in 

whole or in part.

 MS. PERRY: Even the petitioner's brief describes 

the language "resulting in whole or in part" as an 

elaboration of proximate cause. They recognize that it 

has bearing on proximate cause. And so if it has bearing 

on proximate cause in Section 51, it certainly would have 

bearing on proximate cause if it was incorporated into 

the language of the instruction on contributory 

negligence. 

So that may be one reason for not including the

language, but another reason is that it does affect the 

causation standard and Congress did not incorporate it in 

Section 53, whereas it did have it in Section 51. And 

when it modified the statute in 1939 for assumption of 

the risk, to abolish assumption of the risk, it did not 

equate proximate cause and "resulting in whole or in 

part" necessarily as the same thing because one version 

had proximate cause and it was not adopted. The phrase 

"resulting in whole or in part" was used in its place. 

So suggesting that Congress may, in fact, have 

seen a difference, just as Rogers concluded, and I think 

rightly so. 

Moreover, as I said, that has been the law for 50 

years, and it's pretty settled in this country and it 

would create a massive change if this Court were to 

depart from that. Moreover, this is not the right case 

to decide that because the language in instruction 12 

said, "resulting in whole or in part." And petitioner 

has never --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It is not the kind of change 

anybody would have relied on, is it? I mean, I find it 

hard to see reliance interest on this interpretation.

 MS. PERRY: Excuse me, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I find it hard to see any 

reliance interest on this 50 year old interpretation.

mean, he acted, that he allowed that instruction to be 

used, and now they're attempting to disrupt this 

judgment.

workman compensation schemes and Congress have all relied 

on it.

workers, and that may be very well be because of this

like to address just sort of two issues. One is the 

minimalist issue that Justice Breyer asked about. It 

seems to me that the minimalist way to look at this case 

is we raised the question of whether or not the Missouri 

standard which says that you cannot deviate from our 

designated instructions creates a disparity in the way 

you approach negligence and contributory negligence, that 

disparity is inconsistent with the common law doctrines, 

and nothing in FELA modifies it, and it's wrong. And 

that by itself warrants the case being set aside and a 

new jury being -- and a new trial. That's the simplest 

way to resolve the issue. 

If the Court wishes to go forward and deal with 

the issue that Justice Souter addressed, then the 

question is, what does Rogers mean and what do you do 

with this "in whole or in part" language. And if you go 

back -- you asked the question, Justice Souter, you know, 

what does the common law say. We cite this on page 38. 

If its negligence contributes proximately to the injury, 

no matter how slightly -- there must be a dozen cases 

that we cite in those briefs that talk about no matter 

how slightly. And they refer to "in whole or in part" as 

language that still recognizes that you still require 

proximate causation. 

The reality is nothing in Rogers remotely casts

doubt on cases like Brady that say but-for causation is 

not enough, you have to have proximate causation, or 

Earnest, where this Court said that proximate causation 

is the correct jury instruction that has to be given. 

This Court said nothing about that in Rogers.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you have in your ideal 

instruction the words proximate cause given to the jury, 

that defendant's negligence must be the proximate cause 

of plaintiff's injury?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice Ginsburg. We didn't 

ask for that. All I'm saying to you --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you?

 MR. PHILLIPS: -- is that the guidance of the 

Court on remand, you could, and we would ask you to 

address that issue and to resolve it. It is fairly in 

front of you.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in your model instruction, 

in your correct instruction, would the jury be told, in

incomprehensible to juries?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this one very brief 

question, Mr. Chief Justice. 

In your view, would the doctrine of equivalence be

the way that instruction reads today, Justice Stevens.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Phillips. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 2:01 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
