 (10:04 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 07-499, Negusie v. 

Mukasey.

 Mr. Pincus.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 A father forced at gunpoint to engage in 

incest with his daughter because of his religion, race, 

or political views, and told that he and his daughter 

will be killed if he refuses, is far outside the class 

of persons brought to mind by the ordinary meaning of 

the phrase at issue in this case, which is reprinted on 

page 1 of our brief, quoting from section (a)(42): "Any 

person who ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise 

participated in the persecution of any person" on 

account of a prohibited factor.

 The same is true if -- of someone who, as 

part of the religious persecution directed against him, 

is forced on threat of death to disrupt a prayer meeting 

and injure his co-religionists. The father and the 

co-religionists are victims of persecution. They would

not be described in ordinary parlance as "persecutors." 

And we think that that really under the Government's 

view, the persecutor bar turns solely on what they term 

"objective effect of an individual's acts." But that 

means that the act need not be accompanied by any of the 

indicia of moral offensiveness that the law typically 

requires, even if the individual acted under duress, 

under threat of death, even if the individual did not 

know that his conduct related to persecution, and even 

if the individual.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we begin with the 

assumption that this is a Chevron deference case? And I 

think Aguirre, INS v. Aguirre, would tell us that it is. 

It was a different statute. Do we begin with that 

assumption?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, I think under Chevron 

that, one, the first question is is there a gap to be 

filled here? The language --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do I begin with 

Chevron?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, yes. We think Chevron 

supplies the framework. The first question is, is there 

ambiguity. We would -- we argue that here and our 

principal submission is that there is no ambiguity here 

and that there is therefore no occasion for deference.

If the Court were to disagree with that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it your 

position is that there's no ambiguity in the way the 

term is used in the statute, as opposed to no ambiguity 

in some abstract sense?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, our submission, 

Mr. Chief Justice, is that the phrase here, using the 

principle that the Court applied in Watson and looking 

at the phrase and looking at the picture that it brings 

to mind, would never bring to mind the examples that I 

cited as conduct that would be captured by this 

provision.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Pincus, could I ask 

about your description of the Government's position as 

saying that it's purely objective and that there's no 

mental factor whatever. Is it clear that the Government 

not only would not take into account coercion, the fact 

that it was done under coercion, but also would not take 

into account the fact that the individual even knew?

 MR. PINCUS: There are cases --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that he was persecuting 

somebody?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor, there are 

cases, some of which that determination has been 

reversed by a court of appeals. But the BIA has taken

the position that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Has the Government taken 

that position here in in this case?

 MR. PINCUS: The -- well, we pointed out 

that that is the position that the BIA has taken and the 

Government has not disavowed it. So I don't know 

whether they're --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess I should ask the 

Government?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor. But there 

certainly have been a number of decisions along that 

line, including one, for example, where an individual 

was told, you know, "Stand here. "

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I could think that that's 

wrong without thinking that you also have to take into 

account whether there was coercion.

 MR. PINCUS: You could, Your Honor, although 

the underlying -- the Government's underlying theory for 

all three of its positions, both that coercion doesn't 

matter, that knowledge doesn't matter, and that 

subjective intent doesn't matter, is its view that these 

words require only objective acts. Once you've 

determined that the words require something more --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but it's very -- -

it's very common in -- in criminal statutes to require

knowledge of the act. Indeed, if the person doesn't 

know what he's doing, you know, he may be insane, but 

he's not a criminal. Whereas, it is not automatically 

clear that the fact that the -- you killed somebody 

because otherwise they'd break your arm would -- would 

be a justification. I mean, it seems to me the two are 

quite separable.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, two responses, Your 

Honor. Certainly in the criminal context, duress is a 

well-recognized defense and this Court has said that in 

Dixon and other cases. But I just want to be clear that 

the knowledge that we are talking about here that the 

Government has disavowed is not knowledge that you 

engaged in an act. They don't -- they don't take the 

position that sleepwalking is -- can be a persecutive 

act. But their view is even if you don't know that your 

act is contributing to persecution -- you're kept in the 

dark by the actual persecutors; they just ask you to do 

something that in fact is contributing to persecution --

- they say that doesn't matter, and that it all rests on 

what we think is their wrong-headed construction of the 

statute.

 I just want to return to --

JUSTICE ALITO: Your position is that any 

threat of serious injury is sufficient?

MR. PINCUS: Excuse me?

 JUSTICE ALITO: Your position is that any 

threat of serious injury is sufficient?

 MR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor. I mean, 

obviously --

JUSTICE ALITO: But that's what your brief 

says: "Being forced upon threat of death or serious 

injury to participate in the persecutory acts of his 

oppressors."

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, and our position is that 

that's a logical starting point. There is of course a 

body of law that's been developed in the criminal 

context about the parameters about the defense of duress 

and that would be a pretty logical starting point, we 

think. The Attorney General would have discretion, once 

the Court corrected the view that the statute doesn't --

that coercion is irrelevant, just to, within the limits 

of Chevron, define what the coercion test is.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If someone said, if you 

don't -- there are 500 men, women and children in a 

shed; if you don't administer lethal gas to them, we are 

going to administer 20 lashes, that would be sufficient 

in your view?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, under some -- under some 

conceptions of this defense, there is a balancing test

between the threat that is directed against the 

individual and the threat -- and what the injury that he 

is asked to carry out. That could be part of the test.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's not very 

helpful. How would the balancing be struck? How would 

you strike it there?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, what the courts have said 

in the criminal context is that there are three 

criteria: An immediate threat of death or serious 

bodily injury; a well-grounded fear that it will be 

carried out; and no reasonable opportunity to escape. 

That's the general standard. So in the criminal context 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you wouldn't balance. 

So, you know, gas these 20,000 people or we will kill 

you?

 MR. PINCUS: It might be appropriate --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You gas the 20,000 people, 

right, and that's okay?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, some courts have said 

that murder is a different kettle of fish and that there 

is a question unanswered in the Federal system about 

whether or not there is a direct defense for murder. 

The States are divided. The Model Penal Code has said 

yes, there should be. That is one of the issues that

would be open for the Attorney General to the extent he 

wishes to exercise his discretion to decide.

 What's clear, though, is, we think, the 

rule -- the current construction of the statute is not 

right. There is a body of law out there that is well 

developed in the criminal context that could be a very 

logical starting point.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why shouldn't the 

starting point be what this Court decided in the 

Fedorenko case? The wording of this provision is very 

close to the wording of that statute, much closer than 

the UN covenant that you have referred to.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, two responses 

to that. First of all, the language in Fedorenko, the 

text was very context-specific and it shows that. The 

language that applied there specifically referred to the 

enemy and specifically referred to persecution of 

civilians, making it quite clear that that was a statute 

that was targeted in the specific World War II context, 

which was all that it applied to.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It was also the distinction 

about the use of the word "voluntary," in which the 

operative language which barred those people didn't have 

"voluntary" in it, and I forget what it was, the next 

textual section it was there, so it was reason to infer

that voluntary activity was not a criteria for the bar. 

Isn't that right?

 MR. PINCUS: Exactly, Your Honor, and the 

Court said the deliberate omission -- it specifically 

looked at the fact that these sections were adopted at 

the same time, followed on each other immediately, and 

one had "voluntary," and then it said this was a 

deliberate omission and we conclude that that deliberate 

omission provides the basis for interpreting the 

language --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you take the position 

that the Government is wrong in saying that it's bound 

by Fedorenko and that's the reason perhaps for us to 

send it back?

 MR. PINCUS: Exactly, Your Honor. I was 

going to get to the second part of your Chevron question 

and respond just that. If the Court were to conclude, 

contrary to our submission, that the language here is 

ambiguous and there's a gap to fill, our position is --

and we think it's quite well borne out by the decisions 

-- that the BIA's decisions here rested on the mistaken 

assumption that Fedorenko bound it in this case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And do we begin with the 

decision in Rodriguez-Majano, the BIA decision --

MR. PINCUS: Yes.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- which cited Fedorenko?

 MR. PINCUS: Rodriguez-Majano was the first 

one. The issue was not even raised in that case. It 

was dicta in the paragraph before citing Fedorenko> In 

fact, the BIA says: "The service agreed at oral 

argument that the actions don't constitute participation 

and persecution." So there really wasn't an issue 

there. But all that's there is a sentence and a 

reliance on Fedorenko, seems pretty clear that that 

decision just mistakenly believed Fedorenko controlled 

the case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, to give the devil his 

due, it's not just the BIA that took that view, it's 

every court of appeals that -- that has looked at this 

provision has said that Fedorenko is a guide to what it 

means, right?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you are faulting the BIA 

for -- you are saying it's beyond reasonable 

interpretation for the BIA to adopt the -- the 

resolution of the ambiguity, assuming there is an 

ambiguity, which comports with every court of appeals to 

address the matter has said?

 MR. PINCUS: I think there are -- there are 

two different questions here, Justice Scalia. If the

BIA purported to -- if the -- if the BIA said there is a 

gap to fill here, we are going to exercise our expertise 

and discretion and decide that, that would be one 

situation. We think it's quite clear here that the BIA 

believed erroneously that Fedorenko compelled the 

result, that it thought this was a Chevron step one 

case, and it was merely reciting what it believed to be 

the rule and saying that Fedorenko controls. So we 

think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you think that's 

clear? What's -- what's the text you rely on?

 MR. PINCUS: The text that we are relying on 

is -- is the actual decision, which just makes a flat 

statement, again in dicta: "The participation or" -- I 

am reading from Rodriguez-Majano.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do I have it in front of 

me?

 MR. PINCUS: You don't. It's a decision of 

the BIA.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, gee. I mean, if this 

is central to your case, don't you think I ought to have 

the language in front of me somewhere?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, actually the language is 

on page 27 of our yellow brief.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wonderful.

MR. PINCUS: At the very top of the page. 

So all that there is there is a recitation of the rule 

and a citation to Fedorenko. And our submission is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a "see" citation, 

right?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I mean, you know, 

it's just not a flat citation which would say that 

governs. It means this is a relevant case that you 

should look to. And you don't deny that it's relevant. 

You try to distinguish it, but it's certainly something 

you should consider, no?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, it is 

certainly --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's all you have to 

say that they -- they based it on Fedorenko?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes. Well, first of all, as I 

say --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not very much.

 MR. PINCUS: -- the statement in this 

decision is dicta. Here I'm not sure whether they 

consulted the Bluebook before they picked the "see" 

cite, but -- but it -- it seems to me that -- that all 

we have here is a legal rule and a legal rule that 

generally has been perceived to be the rule that -- that

was announced by Fedorenko, not tied in any way to the 

different statutory language at issue in this case or 

anything else.

 Let me -- let me also turn to the second 

decision that is relied on, which is the decision in 

this case. And there -- and I am looking at -- at page 

6a of the petition. And the BIA says, citing to -- to 

its prior decision in Matter of Fedorenko, it -- it 

recites this rule. Now --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a "see" cite again, 

isn't it?

 MR. PINCUS: It's another "see" cite.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right, that's good.

 MR. PINCUS: Which they indicate because 

they are actually directly -- well, anyway.

 The Matter of Fedorenko, that's a case --

and I apologize. In our brief we said that was the case 

that relied on the DPA. That's actually a case that 

involved the Holtzman Amendment, again not the statute 

at issue in this case, and therefore just sort of 

reflexively taking a rule in a different case and 

applying it to this very different statute without any 

analysis. And not to get into too much of a train of 

BIA logic, but I think it is important.

Laipenieks, which is the actually the -- the precedent 

that Matter of Fedorenko relies on, again specifically 

called out the language of Fedorenko and says, as in 

Fedorenko -- and I am quoting from page 464 of that 

decision -- as in Fedorenko, the plain language mandates 

the result.

 So here in -- in all of the BIA analysis, 

there is no analysis in terms of exercising expertise 

and discretion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Where --

the plain language dictates the result, where do I see 

that?

 MR. PINCUS: I apologize. It's in a 

different BIA decision. It's In the Matter of 

Laipenieks decision at page 464.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You say "Citing Matter of 

Laipenieks"?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Citing it. It says "citing 

Matter of Laipenieks." Do you know if they cited it 

just flatly or was it a "see" cite?

 MR. PINCUS: That I don't know, Your Honor.

that the plain language of the statute dictates a 

particular result, I say -- I suspect that that's a 

concession we are in Chevron step one, rather than two.

 MR. PINCUS: Exactly, Your Honor. And 

that's why in -- my response to Justice Kennedy's 

question is that if the Court were to disagree with us 

and conclude, contrary to our submission that the 

language is ambiguous, then we don't have an exercise of 

agency discretion under step one or step two, because 

all the agency decisions rest on the belief that the 

statutory language forecloses that -- the -- the.

 Exercise of that discretion.

 So in that event we submit the appropriate 

result would be to remand the case, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Pincus, can you tell 

me: What is the consequence of this? I mean if, 

indeed, your client is -- is denied asylum because --

because he participated in -- in, under coercion or not, 

discriminatory action against others, what is the 

consequence? He is not sent back to the -- to the 

country that -- that is persecuting him, is he?

 Well, his -- his deportation has been 

deferred under the Convention Against Torture. So he 

has some -- some protection, not the protection, not the 

full protections that he would be entitled to if he were

found to be a refugee.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what happens to 

him? Does he -- does he stay here or --

MR. PINCUS: He gets to stay here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Until some other country 

other than the one that will persecute him will receive 

him, is that -- is that it?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes. Or if -- if he were to --

he gets to stay here as long as sending him back would 

not involve torture. So the protection is narrower than 

the protection that generally would be available in two 

senses:

 First of all, it only applies to torture. 

If you were sent back and you were going to be 

imprisoned for life for your -- for the acts that are 

protected --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, really?

 MR. PINCUS: -- the CAT would not protect 

you. And CAT also does not protect you against 

non-state actions. So especially in the world today, 

where a lot of the bad things that happen in other 

countries are by rebels and non-state actors, the 

Convention Against Torture would not provide protection 

in that situation. So it's broader protection for a 

broader -- for a somewhat broader group of people.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Let me ask you -- let me ask 

you about another practical consequence of your 

provision. I -- I have seen a lot of these asylum 

cases, and usually the evidence consists almost entirely 

of the uncorroborated statement made by the person who 

is claiming asylum.

 So in your view the immigration judges are 

going to have to decide the degree of the threat that 

the asylum claimant underwent and the consequences of 

failing to comply with whatever he was directed to do. 

And they are going to have to do that based solely on 

the credibility determination made about an 

uncorroborated witness who's typically testifying 

through an interpreter and who has all of the mannerisms 

and aspects of speech of someone who comes from an 

entirely different culture. That's the consequences of 

the position that you are advocating?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor, just -- just 

as in the initial question about whether someone has 

been subject to persecution in the first place, that's 

-- that is the process that we have. And immigration 

judges are quite skilled in getting to the bottom of 

what's going on.

 They also have, in addition -- and as relied

on in this case --

JUSTICE ALITO: You really think that's 

true? They are quite skilled at getting to the bottom 

of making --

MR. PINCUS: Well, I think -- I think it is 

their job. I think they also have the country reports 

that the State Department prepares, and they were relied 

on in this case. If -- if, for example, someone were to 

come in and say, I am a victim of coercion, and the 

country report does not provide any indication that that 

is happening in the country, that's obviously a reason 

to look quite skeptically --

JUDGE SCALIA: Well, if I claim I would be 

subject to persecution in Denmark if I were sent there, 

that might be an easy question. But they typically come 

from a country where there is persecution, and they 

could easily have been subjected to it, or they could 

also just as easily have read about it or heard about it 

in -- along their way here.

 You think that's an easy determination?

 MR. PINCUS: If -- but -- well, but it's 

true of the initial claim of persecution. But if -- if 

the refugee, an asylum applicant, comes and says, I have 

been subject to persecution, and there is no issue of 

coercion in the case, that is -- the concern that you

have identified arises there. If a case-specific, the 

case-specific decision has to be made, this is an 

additional question that will have to be answered.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Your unprovable question 

upon unprovable question. I mean, to say that one 

question is really, really hard to figure out is no 

justification for laying on another one.

 MR. PINCUS: And -- and we also think it's 

significant in this respect, that the Secretary of 

Homeland Security has in connection with a different 

disability, the material support disability, said that, 

promulgated an exclusion for -- in some circumstances 

for people who are coerced to provide material support.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I am quite curious why -- I 

am curious, why did you answer Justice Alito's question 

"yes"? I -- I would have thought that if you win this 

case, the Attorney General would still have tremendous 

leeway in deciding where, when, under what 

circumstances, the duress defense applied. Why isn't 

that so?

 MR. PINCUS: That's absolutely right, 

Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If that's right, then why 

do you not -- why was your answer yes?

action by the Attorney General. But I think you are 

absolutely right that the important thing to point out 

here is, as with the standard itself, the Attorney 

General could in the asylum context decide that in 

certain kinds of situations that this coercion is not 

relevant.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Pincus, refresh my 

recollection about something about the Fedorenko case, 

which I should have reread, but I honestly didn't in 

detail. Am I not correct that the point that 

Justice Alito makes was really part of the background of 

the case there was that nobody really believed his 

testimony? It was assumed, for purposes of decision, 

that he was telling the truth, but it was pretty clear 

he was not. Whereas here everybody does assume, for 

purposes of decision, that this man is telling the 

truth?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, I think that's -- that's 

correct, Justice Stevens. And part of what was going on 

there was the sheer -- two things: The sheer 

administrative burden of millions of refugees and the 

need to process them in some kind of expeditious 

fashion; and the fact that it was known that there was 

sort of an organized effort by people who had been 

participating, especially in the concentration camps, to

come up with this defense.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Pincus, I didn't -- I 

didn't get the bottom line of your exchange with 

Justice Breyer. Is it your position that there -- there 

has to be some -- some coercion defense, but it's up to 

the Attorney General to say what it is? I mean, he 

could say only if he were threatened with death?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And only if you were 

threatened with torture, not if it was threatened that 

your family would be exterminated? Where do you get 

that discretion in the -- in the statute?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, the Attorney General has 

rulemaking authority in the asylum area, certainly. And 

we think even in -- even with respect --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Any old coercion defense he 

can do -- make. So long as there is some coercion 

defense, that's all you want. Some coercion defense?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, we think the question now 

before the Court is, is there no coercion defense? 

That's the -- that's the Government's position --

flatly, totally irrelevant.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But why does the Attorney 

General have expertise in -- in that area? I can 

understand why he has expertise when he knows that, from

experience, that certain defenses are harder to prove 

than others, that certain evidence is harder to obtain 

than other evidence. But does the Attorney General 

really have expertise in determining degrees of duress, 

degrees of culpability? Is that within the Chevron 

framework?

 MR. PINCUS: Well, it -- it -- it seems to 

me it could well -- I mean, obviously, that would be a 

question that would come up, but -- but given that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know why you -- I 

don't know why you concede that.

 MR. PINCUS: Well, I think once there is a 

coercion defense, it would be fleshed out in the 

administrative process.

past step one of Chevron. You say that this statute is 

clear. You say it's not ambiguous.

 MR. PINCUS: Absolutely. Well, we --

ambiguous if, you know, there is some old coercion 

defense, but we don't really know what it is.

going to say step one is clear, there has to be some 

coercion defense that -- you know, of -- of a

substantial nature that the Attorney General cannot 

fritter away.

 MR. PINCUS: We agree with that, Your Honor, 

and I apologize if I suggested to the contrary.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would be -- what 

would be the minimum. You say the statute is clear. It 

requires some culpability, how would you verbalize what 

is the lowest standard that the Attorney General could 

impose to read statute to infuse in it some element of 

culpability?

 MR. PINCUS: Because the statutory context 

here was to implement our treaty obligations, and the 

treaty obligations refers -- refer to criminal 

conduct -- we think the logical starting point that --

that you are asking about, Justice Ginsburg, would be 

the criminal law standards, which, as I say, are well 

developed in the Federal system.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Serious bodily harm?

 MR. PINCUS: Yes, it's a -- it's a 

three-part test: Threat of serious bodily harm; no 

reasonable well-grounded fear that it will be carried 

out; and no reasonable way to avoid it.

 Unless the Court has any further questions, 

I'll reserve the time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. KATSAS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. KATSAS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In categorical terms, the Immigration and 

Nationality Act provides that persons who assist or 

otherwise participate in persecution may not obtain 

certain immigration benefits.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where you stopped --

you stopped in the part that interests me, "participated 

in persecution on account of race, religion, nationality 

or membership in a particular group. When these people 

are forced to engage in persecution, it's not because of 

the victim's race or religion; it's because someone's 

got a gun at their head.

 So, you ask them, "Well, why did you do 

that? Why did you, you know, whip that person? They 

will say: Because they were going to kill me. They are 

not going to say, I -- you know, because I was biased 

against his race or religion.

 MR. KATSAS: No, but the -- the "on account 

of" phrase, Mr. Chief Justice, modifies the 

"persecution." The persecution in this case was

directed --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do you 

know that? Why can't it just as easily modify 

"incited," "participated in"? You have persecution. 

Did they participate in the persecution on account of 

race; or did they participate, again, in the persecution 

on account of what the -- what the force exerted against 

them was?

 MR. KATSAS: I think grammatically, the 

immediately preceding noun is "persecution." If the "on 

account of" phrase modified -- modified the assistance, 

Mr. Chief Justice, it seems to me that would prove far 

too much, in that a prison guard who served voluntarily, 

voluntarily in order to get a paycheck, wouldn't be 

within the bar because he would -- he wouldn't be 

assisting on account of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that just 

bring you back to what "assistance" means. If you --

normal statutory canon, you have got "ordered," 

"incited," "assisted."

 MR. KATSAS: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: "Assistance" can be 

read in the same sense as ordered or incited with terms 

of an active -- I don't know what it is --

predisposition or desire. Or it can be read in the

manner you suggested, somebody who's just doing it 

for -- for the paycheck.

 So, if we read it in eiusdem generis terms, 

then I think your response falls short.

 MR. KATSAS: I don't -- I don't think so, 

Mr. Chief Justice, in that the question here -- the 

question here is the availability of a duress defense. 

One can -- one can order persecution under duress just 

as one could assist in persecution under duress.

 Imagine, for instance, the camp commandant 

at Treblinka ordering the slaughter of thousands of 

innocent people. He could say: Well, I'm doing that 

under duress because if I don't, if I don't order 

persecution, someone up my chain of command will kill 

me, which is precisely what's wrong with Petitioner's 

theory here, its -- its unbounded nature.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that 

argument is at one extreme, where if this does apply as 

the way Petitioner suggests we assume the Attorney 

General can exercise his discretion and not afford 

relief. But on the other hand, it could go to some of 

the horrific examples that Mr. Pincus suggested; and in 

those circumstances the Attorney General could exercise 

his discretion to afford relief.

 MR. KATSAS: The Attorney General does not

have discretion with respect to withholding. And 

remember, the persecutor bar in the asylum statute is 

identical to the persecutor bar in the withholding 

statute.

 But in any event, this Court said in cases 

like Phinpathya the fact that the text goes to an 

eligibility requirement is not a ground for the Court 

reading in limitations that aren't there on the theory 

that the Attorney General can address something case by 

case. That's because immigration is subject to the 

plenary control of Congress, and when Congress writes a 

rule and this Court converts it into a standard, it's 

shifting control over the immigration laws from Congress 

to the Executive and ultimately to the courts.

 It seems to us that reasoning governs here. 

With respect to your question about hard hypotheticals, 

I don't dispute that there are hard, sympathetic --

sympathetic persecutors on Mr. Pincus' side of the case, 

but keep in mind what is at stake here.

 Persecution is not typically a grassroots 

phenomenon. It's a -- it's a phenomenon typically 

ordered by governments or rebel groups aspiring to be 

governments. It's typically carried out through 

coercion. So if Petitioners are correct, not only the 

prison guard in this case who held a gun to keep people

out in the sun until they died, not only would he have a 

colorable defense, but so too would every single guard 

at Treblinka.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so too would, I 

gather, the person who is threatened with harm if he 

doesn't build the prison walls, right? He knows they 

are going to be used to persecute people and hold them 

in. I mean, if -- you know, if you push the extreme 

interpretations they go either way.

 MR. KATSAS: But the point --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does he -- does he 

persecute people on account of race?

 MR. KATSAS: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We have a prison 

here; we are going to hold members of a particular 

racial group here, and we are going to force you to 

build the walls.

 MR. KATSAS: Mr. Chief Justice, you are 

absolutely correct that there will, of course, be hard 

cases about how broadly to draw the circle. But in 

Fedorenko, this Court instructed that the way to deal 

with that problem is not by reading in a -- a 

voluntariness exception into a statute that simply 

doesn't contain it, but rather by --

that it is unbounded. If the legislature passes a 

statute requiring specific intent, scienter, concepts of 

personal responsibility, we don't say this is unbounded.

 MR. KATSAS: Of course, Justice Kennedy, 

Congress could pass a statute with whatever --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm saying in the general 

criminal law. We don't say, oh, this is unbounded. 

This is what courts are for. This is what adjudication 

is for, is to establish and define what duress means, 

what scienter means, what degree of intent is culpable, 

what isn't. It's not unbounded.

 MR. KATSAS: That's true in the context of 

criminal law. But think about why it's true, 

Justice Kennedy. It's true because Congress when it 

passes criminal statutes legislates against a background 

of hundreds of years of common law precedent in the 

criminal area; and this Court has said presumptively 

Congress legislates against that common law background, 

and that is the theory for on some occasions reading 

mens rea requirements and common law defenses like 

duress into criminal statutes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not any statute? I'm 

mean, starting where Justice Kennedy left off, you said 

a hundred years. It's thousands of years. You could go 

back into the history of the human race --

MR. KATSAS: Exactly.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and you will discover, 

of course, that your word "involuntary" is never 

something where the action is involuntary that we praise 

or blame people. Rather, every action where we praise 

or blame people must be a voluntary action. The classic 

example is: "The wind blew my arm." Now, you are 

saying that if this person's arm was blown by the wind, 

that this statute prevents him having asylum in the 

United States or having -- you know, withholding. How 

could one assume that involuntary actions are covered by 

this statute -- are not covered?

 MR. KATSAS: Justice Breyer, the case --

JUSTICE BREYER: Are covered.

 MR. KATSAS: Two points. With respect --

with respect to involuntary actions, this case -- this 

case doesn't present that question.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then once you 

say that, then let's talk about intentional actions.

 MR. KATSAS: Okay.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And are you going to have 

intentional actions?

 MR. KATSAS: Yes.

action, and an action where there is a degree of 

freedom, which is to say that the choice is not too 

skewed. And we see that in the criminal law by a 

reading into statutes that say nothing of the word 

"intentional," and by the use of the duress defense.

 Now what reason do we have for thinking that 

Congress didn't mean these words here in exactly that 

way, which traces back at least to Aristotle?

 MR. KATSAS: Because the thousand-year 

tradition that you correctly identify is a criminal law 

tradition.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, but Aristotle doesn't 

say criminal law. He says praise or blame.

 MR. KATSAS: Justice Breyer, this is a 

statute -- this is a statute that allocates immigration 

benefits. Immigration law is a creature of statute. 

There is no background in common law --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's absolutely right. 

But do you think Congress intended that this absolute 

bar should apply where the person is in no sense 

blameworthy?

 MR. KATSAS: The question -- with respect to 

intentional conduct, the conduct at issue here, 

Justice Breyer, is knowing and intentional. So there is 

no question about --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, the reasoning here, Mr. 

Katsas, it seems to me implicates exactly what 

Justice Breyer brings up. We had a colloquy earlier on 

-- on the extent of the reliance by the BIA for its 

general policy on Fedorenko, and what the does a see 

cite mean and so on. But in -- in this particular case, 

going to page 6a or 7a from which Mr. Pincus was -- was 

earlier quoting, if you look on page 7a, the reason that 

Fedorenko is thought to be appropriate here is, he --

that is to say, the Petitioner here -- has not 

demonstrated his conduct is distinguishable from that of 

the alien in that case. The conduct of the alien in 

that case was identified as relevant by the 

voluntary/involuntary distinction. It was so identified 

because of the text of the statute, voluntary was used 

in one place; it wasn't used in the place where the bar 

was set up.

 So that it seems to me that by the express 

reasoning in this case, this case is governed by a rule 

that in effect says the distinction between voluntary 

and involuntary action is not a relevant distinction.

 So I don't thin k you can get by in this 

case without confronting just what Justice Breyer says. 

And I don't see how you can answer his point in this 

case without admitting that Fedorenko in fact was -- was

improvidently relied upon, because it's not good 

authority here.

 MR. KATSAS: I -- I don't know why it --

with respect to the BIA's reasoning, this decision is a 

straightforward application of 20 years of BIA precedent 

concluding -- consistent with Fedorenko that 

voluntariness is not relevant matter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: This is not really 

consistency with Fedorenko. This -- in this case the 

BIA is saying that he cannot say that his conduct in 

effect is different from the conduct in Fedorenko. And 

what was relevant about the Fedorenko conduct was it did 

not have to be voluntary conduct.

 So it is bringing -- it seems to me, the 

reasoning in this case is relying upon a rule that says 

that the voluntary/involuntary distinction is not 

significant.

 MR. KATSAS: Right. That was the 

construction -- with the construction --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Which answers 

Justice Breyer's question.

 MR. KATSAS: But the -- I may be missing 

some of the subtlety of your point. But let me try --

MR. KATSAS: Let me try it this way. The --

the statutory formulation that we are discussing is the 

concept of assistance in persecution. Fedorenko in the 

context of the displaced person's act construes that 

provision to make involuntariness irrelevant as a matter 

of law.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right.

 MR. KATSAS: Many courts of appeals and the 

BIA repeatedly over the last 20 years have held that the 

reasoning that Fedorenko governs not only the displaced 

person's act, where it is of course directly 

controlling, but subsequent statutes, of which there are 

no fewer than seven, using essentially the identical 

formulation of assistance in persecution: Congress 

carries forward that formulation in a canonical way 

statute after statute.

 If you look to legislative history, you will 

see that Congress repeatedly expresses an affirmative 

intent that all of these persecutor bar provisions be 

construed in pari materia and against that backdrop we 

have administrative precedent.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But one thing that Congress 

has not done and it didn't do it in this Act, is to make 

the express voluntary/involuntary distinction textually 

that the DPA made in Fedorenko. And it seems to me that

the reasoning set out in this case says this is exactly 

like the Fedorenko situation; that implies that the same 

rule in Fedorenko should apply. If the same rule 

applies, presumably it should be on the basis of a 

statute which is identical on the -- on the textual 

voluntariness point to the statute in Fedorenko. This 

one -- this one is not.

 MR. KATSAS: Identical or not textually 

distinguishable, to the extent that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you don't have the 

voluntary/involuntary distinction here in -- or -- in 

textual treatment that you had in -- in the DPA statute 

in Fedorenko, do you?

 MR. KATSAS: You -- well, you have the same 

operative language of assisting persecution.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You don't -- you don't 

follow that with the section that uses the word 

"voluntary," whereas the bar does not use the word 

"voluntary," right?

 MR. KATSAS: Except you do. Throughout the 

-- throughout the INA are provisions that are expressly 

keyed to voluntariness. So you have the same -- the 

same contrast can be made with respect to the INA bars 

as Fedorenko made with respect to the DPA bar.

MR. KATSAS: And they --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Can you give me a couple of 

examples of the voluntariness that creates in effect the 

same distinction here as under the DPA?

 MR. KATSAS: Sure. Let me give you one: 

The asylum -- the asylum statute -- the substantive 

asylum statute itself in 8 U.S.C. 1158 provides --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Was that passed as part of 

the same legislation that created the bar section we are 

dealing with?

 MR. KATSAS: Yes and no. Let me explain. 

Section 1158, the substantive asylum law, did not have a 

persecutor bar as originally enacted by the Refugee Act 

of 1980. The persecutor bar in the substantive asylum 

statute was added in 1996 by the IIRIRA statute, which 

in the same statute, in the same section, has a 

provision that asylum can be terminated if the alien 

voluntarily decides to return to his home.

 So you have a contrast in the same section 

of the same statute. Conduct-based --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's -- I don't want to 

split hairs here, but I mean the voluntary return 

behavior is a behavior of the alien in this country with 

respect to, in effect, an election under existing 

federal law; whereas, the voluntary/involuntary

distinction in the DPA was a distinction that referred 

to the alien's conduct overseas at the relevant time.

 MR. KATSAS: That's a fair point, 

Justice Souter, but to the extent part of the reasoning 

in Fedorenko rests on the -- and the inference from the 

contrast, those same contrasts are present here where --

the point of the example --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You have convinced me there 

are contrasts, but I am not sure that they are contrasts 

that raise the implication in a clear way as it was 

raised in the DPA. And I think that's my only 

disagreement with you at this point.

And your position is that it has narrowed that class, 

perhaps now more than was necessary, but that the 

government thought that, rather than letting in and 

giving asylum to the commandant of Trebenko, it would be 

better to have a provision that simply excludes those 

who, under coercion or not, persecuted others. Isn't 

that --

MR. KATSAS: That's --

about that? Limiting --

you have a clause that says "otherwise participated," 

right?

 MR. KATSAS: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that must mean, I 

gather, or could mean that "assisted" does not have as 

broad a meeting as you suggest, because otherwise the 

"otherwise participated" language would be unnecessary 

and redundant.

 MR. KATSAS: I don't think so, 

Mr. Chief Justice, because the statutory sequence is the 

word "assist" goes all the way back to the Displaced 

Persons Act in the 1977 -- when Congress changes 

"assist" to "assists or otherwise participates in" --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

 MR. KATSAS: -- the only consequence of 

that, if any, could be a broadening, not a narrowing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm not sure 

that's right, because if "otherwise participated" covers 

-- "assisted" does not include "otherwise participated," 

and I understood your broad reading of "assisted" to 

cover the prison walls, and if it does, then I would say 

"assisted" needs to be interpreted with "ordered" and 

"incited," and if it is, then "otherwise participated" 

should be interpreted along the same lines.

"assist" was construed in Fedorenko not to -- not to 

contain an implicit voluntariness exception. Congress 

adds to that the word "participate," which this Court in 

Yeskey construed not to have an implicit involuntariness 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think there 

was just a -- it was a belt-and-suspenders redundancy?

 MR. KATSAS: Either belt-and-suspenders or 

broadening the circle in ways that are difficult to 

describe in the abstract. But "participate" -- this 

Court has said in Reves, "participate" is a term of 

breadth. So I don't -- I don't see the argument that by 

adding an additional term of breadth to the scheme 

Congress somehow narrowed what would otherwise apply.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What I may have 

missed, what was your answer to the prison walls? The 

guy who builds the prison walls?

 MR. KATSAS: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is he or is he not 

participating in the persecution?

 MR. KATSAS: My answer is that the analysis 

of that question does not turn on whether or not he is 

compelled to build the prison walls; it turns on 

footnote 34 of Fedorenko, which says that courts will 

have to draw difficult lines in distinguishing between

the kind of aid that constitutes assistance within the

not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's very helpful.

 MR. KATSAS: But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- can I get from you 

an answer to the question that I put to Mr. Pincus? Do 

you -- does the Government deny even the necessity of 

knowledge that what you are doing is assisting in the 

persecution of somebody? You don't even have to know 

that you are assisting in the persecution?

our position is that knowledge is a sufficient mens rea 

and is clearly satisfied here where Petitioner, by his 

own testimony, knew about the mistreatment.

question?

Justice Stevens, in other cases, that knowledge is not 

required.

happily for me, it is not the position before the Court 

today, particularly --

 MR. KATSAS: -- particularly in light of 

Fedorenko, Justice Scalia, which puts a gloss on 

voluntariness, but does not address --

purpose the statute. What is the difference between 

intent and knowledge, in terms of the purpose of the 

statute? Why is intent different -- lack of intent any 

different from lack of knowledge? If you read this 

statute literally?

 MR. KATSAS: Intent to perform the acts that 

constitute --

JUSTICE BREYER: People use that word 

"intent" in the course of the human race to encompass 

the notion of duress. I mean, that's -- that's 

sometimes done, sometimes not. They are part and parcel 

of the same thing, which is whether you can blame the 

person for what he did.

 MR. KATSAS: They were not the same thing, 

even in the criminal --

JUSTICE BREYER: In criminal law they were 

not, I agree --

MR. KATSAS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- because that's --

because we've seen the need for specificity. But the 

question, I think, Justice Stevens had, and certainly I 

have, is why do you read some aspects of what it takes 

to hold a person responsible into the statute, but you 

don't read other aspects of what it takes to hold a 

person responsible morally into the statute?

 MR. KATSAS: We don't read -- our position 

is it's not fair to -- it's not fair to incorporate the 

full common law background criminal concepts, including 

that of duress. The question by Justice Breyer whether

assistance in persecution contains an implicit duress 

limitation seems to me very different from the question 

whether it contains an implied knowledge limitation. 

And the latter question is not present here with respect 

to a prison guard who, by his own admission, knew 

exactly what was going on and deliberately implemented 

torture by keeping people in the sun, exposed in the sun 

to the point of death.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your concession --

statement earlier on, that there are going to be 

situations for judicial line-drawing --

MR. KATSAS: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it suggests to 

me that BIA's discretion isn't applicable here under 

Chevron step two. Because what you are saying is this 

is not a situation where the statute never applies.

 In a situation where you can logically 

determine and your answer on the knowledge question is 

pertinent, you can logically draw a line between what a 

person's doing and persecution; and yet you said the c 

courts are going to have to draw lines. So BIA -- the 

board might get discretion with respect to where that 

line is drawn and when, but they do not get discretion 

on the question of does it ever apply. And what your 

position is, that this never applies, whenever there is

a but-for logical intention between the action and 

persecution.

 MR. KATSAS: Mr. Chief Justice, they 

certainly get discretion in conducting the analysis of 

what constitutes assistance. But Fedorenko said that 

that -- that inquiry is independent of any question of 

duress on -- it said that the inquiry should happen 

case-by-case, that's fine; but it gave -- the footnote 

in Fedorenko gave us two clear data points to help frame 

the analysis.

 One is the conduct of a woman who does 

nothing more than cut the hair of people bound for 

execution. Court said, as a matter of law, that cannot 

constitute assistance. The other data point is the case 

of an armed prison guard who, perimeter guard who keeps 

people in a camp; and the Court said, of course, that 

constitutes assistance.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you would say 

the woman who cuts the hair does participate in the 

persecution if there is a guideline that says look, we 

are not going to execute anybody unless -- before their 

hair is cut, right?

 MR. KATSAS: I would not say that. I think 

Fedorenko --

as a case that's not covered by the statute, even if the 

person is not going to be executed unless the woman does 

her job?

 MR. KATSAS: I think Fedorenko -- Fedorenko 

says that the -- the level and degree and character of 

assistance of the woman simply cutting the hair does not 

constitute assistance. At the other continuum of 

conduct, Fedorenko says that the conduct of an armed 

prison guard does constitute assistance, even if, as in 

Fedorenko, the guard served under duress.

 And Justice Stevens, if I could come back to 

the facts of Fedorenko, the district court in that case 

found that if Fedorenko did not serve at the prison 

guard -- at the prison camp, he would have been 

executed. That finding was not reversed either by the 

Fifth Circuit or by this Court, which held that duress 

was not relevant to the inquiry of assistance.

engaged in an enterprise where other countries in the 

world -- and should we look to see how they are 

interpreting this notion of duress, coercion? Are they 

considering it irrelevant; would just look to see if the 

person in fact was provided some material assistance to 

persecution?

 MR. KATSAS: Justice Ginsburg, it's true 

that the Displaced Persons Act was limited to the Nazi 

regime, and later statutes, the Refugee Act generalizes 

in the sense of eliminating the time and place 

restrictions on the definition of refugee.

 On the specific question of the persecutor 

bar, Congress carries forward the same language with an 

affirmative indication of intent to preserve the 

concept.

 With respect to your point about the Nazis 

being singularly horrific in human history, think of how 

that feature plays out under Petitioner's theory. Under 

Petitioner's theory, the uniquely horrific nature of the 

Nazi regime gives rise to a dramatically expanded class 

of people who can credibly raise a duress defense on 

anyone under -- anyone under Adolf Hitler in the 

organization chart of the Nazi government could credibly 

say, if I didn't kill Jews, I would be killed myself.

other. They are going to come from one of the groups of 

one or the other.

 MR. PINCUS: They may, Your Honor. But that 

-- that's a problem -- we already have a system where we 

were deciding whether someone is persecuted and all 

these issues arise. We are already looking very 

specifically at all the facts. The same facts -- the 

same factual development would be relevant to the 

coercion issue. As I said, the applicant will bear the 

burden of proof.

 And here, the -- as in other cases, the 

country reports are often relied on and are revealing as 

to whether what the situation is, what the specific 

context is, makes sense.

 If I could turn to the criminal law question 

that Justice Scalia asked. I think the criminal law 

background is very relevant here as well, because the 

treaty that this statute was enacted to implement our 

obligations with respect to, right -- referred 

specifically to crimes. The exclusion that was -- that 

is authorized by the treaty says, and I am quoting from 

an excerpt on page 11 of our reply brief: "has 

committed a crime against people" -- "a war crime or a 

crime against humanity." That therefore makes very 

relevant this body of law that has been developed in the

criminal --

JUSTICE ALITO: Why is that an apt analogy? 

If we looked at all the duress cases that have been 

decided since the beginning, are we going to find cases 

where someone said -- someone claims that I was told I 

had to kill 25 people, 100 people; I had to put people 

out in the sun until they died, because if I didn't do 

that, I was going to be shot?

 Aren't the situations entirely different?

 MR. PINCUS: I think you are combining two 

questions, Your Honor. One -- one is should this 

language be interpreted to have a coercive -- to require 

uncoerced conduct in order to label someone a 

persecutor. We think this is very relevant in deciding 

that question, because the underlying treaty that was 

implemented specifically referred to crimes, and crimes 

generally have that -- that -- crimes don't -- a 

criminal liability doesn't apply to someone who acts if 

they are coerced.

 Whether the precise standards that have been 

developed in the federal criminal context control in all 

situations here, I think that is something that may not 

be clear. As I suggested, the Attorney General may have 

discretion to flesh out, and the board may, what is 

coercion in this context; and there is a debate as I

said before, about whether intentional murder, 

especially the intentional murder of a group of people, 

is -- is an act for which coercion is -- a coercion 

defense is ever available.

 But those are issues that -- that don't take 

away from the fact that here the Government's position 

is there is coercion is totally irrelevant.

 If I could just -- one other issue, the 

voluntariness provisions in the statute that my 

colleague raised in response to Justice Souter's 

question, those provisions were enacted subsequently.

 The 1980 Refugee Act adopted the language
