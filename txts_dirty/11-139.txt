3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 11-139, United States v. 

Home Concrete & Supply. 

6  Mr. Stewart. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  The disputed question in this case concerns 

12 the meaning of the phrase "omits from gross income an 

13 amount properly includible therein" in 26 

14 U.S.C. 6501(e)(1)(A). More specifically, the question 

is whether an omission from gross income occurs when a 

16 taxpayer overstates his basis in sold property and 

17 thereby understates the gain that results from the sale. 

18  In December 2010, after notice-and-comment 

19 rulemaking, the Treasury Department issued published 

regulations that interpreted section 6501(e)(1)(A) to 

21 apply in overstatement of basis cases. Those 

22 regulations reflect a reasonable interpretation of 

23 ambiguous statutory language, and they are accordingly 

24 entitled to deference under Chevron.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but only if

Official 

1 your reading of the Colony decision is correct, right? 

2 If we think that Colony definitively resolved the 

3 question before you, the regulation can't overturn that. 

4  MR. STEWART: If the Court in Colony had 

interpreted the statutory language to be unambiguous, or 

6 if the Court in Colony had issued an authoritative 

7 interpretation that Congress had then built upon, that 

8 would be correct. But the Court in Colony stated that 

9 the language was, in its words, "not unambiguous."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but once -- once we 

11 resolve an ambiguity in a statute, that's the law, and 

12 the agency cannot issue a -- a regulation that changes 

13 the law just because, going in, the language was 

14 ambiguous.

 MR. STEWART: I think -- I don't think that 

16 the Court in Colony purported to give a definitive 

17 definition of the phrase "omits from gross income an 

18 amount properly includible therein" wherever it appears 

19 in the United States Code. And the Court in the first 

paragraph of its opinion in Colony said the sole 

21 question before us is whether the taxpayer is subject to 

22 the extended assessment period under the 19 -- under the 

23 Internal Revenue Code of 1939. 

24  And as the D.C. Circuit, for instance, 

pointed out in Intermountain, what we are interpreting 

4

1 now is the 1954 code. It's true that, like the 1939 

2 code, it includes the phrase "omits from gross income an 

3 amount properly includible therein," but it also 

4 includes adjacent provisions that bear upon the meaning 

of that phrase. I think --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if they use 

7 the exact same phrase, and it's a fairly detailed --

8 it's not just a normal phrase they might use elsewhere, 

9 I think it's reasonable to assume that that phrase came 

in with the baggage it -- it carried from the Colony 

11 case; right? 

12  MR. STEWART: I think it's important to 

13 remember that the 1954 code was enacted in 1954, and the 

14 Colony decision came in 1958. And so, I would take your 

point that if Congress had enacted the same language 

16 after this Court's decision in Colony, then the adjacent 

17 statutory provisions that we're relying on would be 

18 pretty indirect means of an -- of expressing an intent 

19 to change the law.

 But what Congress was reacting to in 1954 

21 was not this Court's Colony decision; it was reacting to 

22 a circuit conflict and trying to resolve that conflict. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but our job is not to 

24 plumb Congress's psyche and decide what they had in 

mind. It's to interpret the statute. And if, as you

1 acknowledge, it's a pretty obscure way to change the law 

2 from what we said it was, the law that's written there, 

3 that's a very obscure way to change it. I'm inclined to 

4 think that the law stays the way it was.

 MR. STEWART: Well, let me point to the 

6 statutory provisions that I have in mind, to explain a 

7 little bit more fully why we think that the context in 

8 which the new provision or the 1954 provision appears 

9 bears on the -- the proper interpretation of the 

disputed phrase. 

11  It's at page 1a of the red brief, the 

12 appendix to the Respondents' brief. 

13  And the -- the general rule stated in 

14 subsection (A) is: "If the taxpayer omits from gross 

income an amount properly includible therein which is in 

16 excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income 

17 stated in the return," the assessment period is 6 years 

18 rather than 3 years. 

19  And it's important to recognize that, for 

purposes of the Internal Revenue Code generally, the 

21 term "gross income" is defined to include gains derived 

22 from dealings in property. And in that sense, it 

23 might --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that -- but that 

argument hasn't changed between the predecessor statute 

6

1 and this statute. You made the same argument under the 

2 Colony statute. It lost. So, you can't go back to that 

3 argument because it's already been rejected. 

4  So, what goes from that?

 MR. STEWART: Well, if you look at 

6 subparagraph (i), Roman (i) -- or Roman (i) after the 

7 general rule, it says: "In the case of a trade or 

8 business, the term 'gross income' means the total of the 

9 amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods or 

services (if such amounts are required to be shown on 

11 the return) prior to diminution by the cost of such" --

12 "of such sales or" --

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My problem with your 

14 argument as I read it in the brief, it's a bit 

convoluted, as Justice Scalia observed. But if Congress 

16 intended to change Colony, it wouldn't just have created 

17 this subdivision (i); it would have changed the main 

18 statement. So, why don't we read this as simply saying 

19 we accept whatever Colony said, and the only thing we're 

-- we're creating exceptions around are the following? 

21 The exception argument. 

22  MR. STEWART: As I say, I would agree that 

23 if Congress had passed this statute after the Court's 

24 decision in Colony, that this would have been a fairly 

oblique way to reflect an intent to change what the

1 Court had done. But Congress was acting in 1954, before 

2 the Court's decision in Colony, and it was reacting to a 

3 circuit conflict. 

4  And I think it's -- it's just as fair to say 

that --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, this language would 

7 have one meaning if the very same language were adopted 

8 after our decision in -- in Colony and a different 

9 meaning if it were adopted, as it was, before our 

decision in Colony. 

11  MR. STEWART: Well, in our -- I think --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's a very strange 

13 approach to a -- to the meaning of a statute, it seems 

14 to me.

 MR. STEWART: It may be strange, but I think 

16 in a sense it's the Respondents who are striving for 

17 strangeness, in the following way --

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but you're 

19 saying -- and I'm just trying to supplement 

Justice Scalia's question so -- so you can continue to 

21 answer it. 

22  You're saying that the split is somehow more 

23 obscure or more imprecise in its formulation than what 

24 Colony did. You're saying that, oh, if Congress knew 

about Colony, they would have done it differently, but

1 it was a split, this was close enough for government 

2 work. That seems to be your argument. And I --

3  (Laughter.) 

4  MR. STEWART: No, I -- I guess there are two 

things I'm saying. The first thing I'm saying is, in 

6 order to construe the statute, we need to not put 

7 ourselves in -- attempt to put ourselves in the minds of 

8 Congress, but at least be aware of the state of the 

9 world at the time that Congress acted.

 And in 1954, when Congress acted, there was 

11 the circuit split. And if Congress had wanted to 

12 endorse the Colony rule going forward and apply it to 

13 trades -- to non-trade and -business taxpayers as well 

14 as trades and businesses, the most natural thing would 

have been to change the word "amount" in the main rule 

16 to "item," to make clear that the main rule would apply 

17 only when an item of gross receipts had been left off 

18 the return altogether. 

19  It also would have been natural, if Congress 

had wanted that rule to apply going forward, to change 

21 the term "gross income" in the main rule to say "gross 

22 receipts" because gross income --

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I still don't understand 

24 why the world was different after Colony addressed the 

split than before Colony addressed the split. The issue

1 is still the same. 

2  MR. STEWART: I guess the way I would 

3 respond to your question, Justice Kennedy, is to say if 

4 you look at the statute in its current form, both the 

text of the main rule and the adjacent provisions that 

6 contextually bear on its meaning, then I think ours is 

7 by far the better interpretation. And, really, 

8 what Respondents --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, by far? By a little 

maybe, and I might agree with that, but -- but we're not 

11 writing on a blank slate here. 

12  MR. STEWART: And what --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Indeed, I think Colony may 

14 well have been wrong, but there it is. It's -- it's the 

law, and it said that that language meant a certain 

16 thing. And the issue is whether this is -- this change 

17 is enough to change the meaning of the statute. And --

18 and I'm dubious about that. 

19  MR. STEWART: I guess my main point is we 

think our reading of the text is better, and what 

21 Respondents have going for them is the argument that, 

22 whether or not this is the way you would otherwise 

23 construe the statute, once Colony has said what the 

24 statute meant, the Court is bound by it.

 And our point is that methodology doesn't

1 really work with this provision, because the Court in 

2 Colony --

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Stewart, don't you have 

4 two arguments? One is that the statute changed, but the 

other is that even the statute remained the -- even if 

6 the statute remained the same, Colony itself was a 

7 decision that found ambiguity in the statute. So, you 

8 have the power under Brand X to go back to that statute 

9 and reinterpret it, if you will.

 MR. STEWART: We do have the power under 

11 Brand X, but we -- we don't think that the Court needs 

12 to reach that question. And when the Court in Colony 

13 said that the --

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: But if the Court thinks it 

has to reach that question because it agrees more with 

16 Justice Scalia than with you as to whether this statute 

17 stays the same, then you have independent Brand X 

18 arguments, don't you? 

19  MR. STEWART: Yes, we do.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, about that 

21 argument, you rely very heavily on the fact that 

22 Justice Harlan used the term "ambiguous," right? 

23  MR. STEWART: Yes. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he was writing 

very much in a pre-Chevron world. I -- he was certainly

1 not on notice that that was a term of art or would
 

2 become a term of art. And, of course, I didn't know
 

3 him, but my sense is he was very gracious and polite.
 

4 And you can see him saying, well, that's a good
 

argument, but.... He's not the sort of person who would 

6 say this is it, this is it. 

7  I don't think you necessarily can take the 

8 use of the word "unambiguous" in his opinion to mean 

9 what it does today.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he did say that 

11 something was unambiguous, and that was the little (i) 

12 that was added. And he also said he wasn't taking any 

13 position on the '54 code; isn't that so? 

14  MR. STEWART: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: He did. 

16  MR. STEWART: And the Court said that both 

17 at the end of its opinion and it also said at the 

18 beginning the only question before us is whether the 

19 extended assessment period applies under the '39 code.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there -- is there 

21 a case where we applied Chevron deference to a 

22 pre-Chevron opinion? In other words saying, well, the 

23 Court looked at that, but the Court said it was 

24 ambiguous; and so, we apply Chevron.

 MR. STEWART: I'm not aware of any case.

1 Obviously, Brand X is a recent decision of this Court. 

2 And I would agree with you that it's perilous to kind of 

3 put a Chevron overlay on decisions that were issued 

4 before Chevron.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Even without Chevron -- I 

6 mean, even apply it, I would have thought the point of 

7 Brand X is you look at the language of the statute and 

8 you look at what Congress intended, and where they 

9 intended the agency to have power to interpret, you 

follow the agency. And you could do that after the 

11 event if the basis for your decision is that it isn't 

12 clear. 

13  But that isn't Harlan's opinion at all. He 

14 goes and looks at what Congress meant, and what they 

meant is treat basis like you treat a deduction. And he 

16 gathers that from the legislative history. And so, I 

17 don't see the basis for saying now the agency still has 

18 power. 

19  Now, forget that one. I mean, that's one 

point you might want to address, but I may be too unique 

21 in that, in which case it's not worth your time. 

22  MR. STEWART: Let me give two -- let me --

23 let me give two responses to that, Justice Breyer. I 

24 think in effect what Justice Harlan did for the Court in 

Colony was to construe the term, the reference to an 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 amount of gross income, as though it meant item of gross 

2 receipts. That was the practical effect of the Court's 

3 decision. And I think two of the -- two of the adjacent 

4 provisions of the current code make clear that that's 

not a --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: No, I didn't think that was 

7 the basis. I thought the basis is that there are two 

8 kinds of things: One is you just don't put in some big 

9 category of stuff in your return, and the agency can 

never figure that one out. And the other is where you 

11 don't state your deductions correctly. 

12  And now, the cost of goods sold and the 

13 basis are difficult cases because of the way the -- the 

14 code defined "gross income." It defines it in terms of 

gain. But Harlan says they're like deductions for 

16 purposes of this statute. That's how I read it. 

17  But I have a different question. You can 

18 pursue this one if you want. My -- what's really 

19 bothering me about this case -- and I can't quite figure 

out the answer to this -- is it seems to me when they 

21 filed that tax return in April of 2000, it was a 

22 terrible loophole, but these lawyers have the job of 

23 creating loopholes or at least trying to take advantage 

24 of them. Okay? And the IRS had told them this was 

okay. Indeed, they had informal advice to that effect.

1  Now, there's a -- you don't put the date of 

2 the year 2000 reg, and I don't know if you're both 

3 talking about the same thing. I was really surprised 

4 there was no date there. Then what happens is, after 

you lose in every circuit -- not you personally -- they 

6 lose in every circuit; and then in the year 2009, they 

7 say, though we lost and though we told everybody this is 

8 okay at the time they filed the return, now we're going 

9 to pass a new reg and we're going to penalize them, 

taking all back this money 9 years later. That seems to 

11 me pretty unfair. So, I'd like to know just that 

12 answer. 

13  MR. STEWART: Well, at the time that the 

14 2009 regulation was promulgated first in temporary form, 

we had lost cases in two courts of appeals. One was 

16 Bakersfield in the Ninth Circuit, but the court of 

17 appeals in that case said that because the statutory 

18 language was ambiguous, the agency might be able still 

19 to promulgate a regulation that would get Chevron 

deference. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what was -- and what 

22 was the date of that, Bakersfield? 

23  MR. STEWART: That was in, I believe, 

24 either -- I believe 2008 was the Ninth Circuit --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, okay.

1  MR. STEWART: -- decision in Bakersfield. 

2 It was -- at any rate, it was before the -- the issuance 

3 of the regulation in temporary form. A couple of months 

4 before the regulation was promulgated, we had lost 

Salman Ranch in the Federal Circuit, but that was by a 

6 two-to-one vote. At that time, we had won this issue in 

7 four trial courts --

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Stewart, prior to 

9 this latest round of litigation, had the IRS ever said, 

ever given any indication, that it viewed Colony as not 

11 controlling any -- any -- any longer? 

12  MR. STEWART: Yes, I think probably the best 

13 indication of our -- the position in the intervening 

14 years -- and we agree that there's a surprising dearth 

of law -- was the Fifth Circuit litigation in Phinney, 

16 P-H-I-N-N-E-Y, which was decided in 1968. Phinney 

17 involved a situation in which the taxpayer accurately 

18 reported the amount of gross receipts, approximately 

19 $375,000, but misstated the nature of the receipts as 

proceeds of a stock sale rather than of an installment 

21 sale. And the reason that that misstatement of the 

22 nature of the receipt made a difference was that it 

23 potentially affected the taxpayer's entitlement to take 

24 a stepped-up basis.

 And so, the court of appeals in Phinney said

1 that was subject to the extended assessment period, that 

2 the misstatement of the nature of the --

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: And as a result of this 

4 case, had the IRS suggested in any kind of guidance or 

rulings or anything else that it viewed Colony as an 

6 outdated decision? Because, you know, I'm a taxpayer, 

7 and I'm reading Colony and I'm thinking the language of 

8 the statute is still the same; why wouldn't Colony 

9 control?

 MR. STEWART: Well, I -- I think one reason 

11 you might think that is that if you were -- you -- the 

12 opinion was not oblivious to the fact that the 1954 code 

13 had been enacted in the meantime, and the Court went out 

14 of its way to say: We are discussing only the 1939 

code, and we are not pronouncing on the meaning of the 

16 1954 code, other than to note that our -- our conclusion 

17 in this case is consistent with the unambiguous language 

18 of new 6501(e)(1)(A). And as the D.C. Circuit explained 

19 in Intermountain, that is best read as a reference to 

subparagraph (i), which says that for a trade or 

21 business taxpayer, "gross income" will mean gross 

22 receipts without an offset for the cost of acquiring 

23 goods and services. So --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: If --

MR. STEWART: -- I think, as a taxpayer, you

1 would at least be on notice that there was uncertainty 

2 as to the proper meaning of the -- the code. Judge 

3 Boudin had written for the First Circuit in a case 

4 called CC&F W. Operations in 2001 that it was at least 

doubtful whether the main holding of Colony carried over 

6 to the new -- the 1954 code. That was certainly dictum, 

7 but it also flagged the fact that this was a subject of 

8 uncertainty. 

9  And remember, the provision at issue here 

doesn't bear on the legality of the taxpayer's 

11 substantive returns. The only question is whether the 

12 IRS has 3 years or 6 years to make an extended 

13 assessment. So, as of 2003, when 3 years from the date 

14 of the return had run for these taxpayers, I think the 

-- what was out there gave them notice that there was at 

16 least uncertainty whether Colony applied. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: You say in your brief on 

18 page 4: "In 2000, the IRS issued a notice informing 

19 taxpayers that Son-of-BOSS transactions were invalid 

under the tax law." And you cite without a date. So, I 

21 was sort of curious whether that particular cite came 

22 before or after they filed their return. 

23  MR. STEWART: I don't know whether --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: And they say that -- and

basically the Colony statement. 

6  MR. STEWART: Well, the --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Are you talking about the 

8 same thing? 

9  MR. STEWART: No. No, those were two 

different documents. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 

12  MR. STEWART: The two --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: So, there are two different 

14 documents. So -- so, in July, they're telling the tax 

bar this is okay. And what you say is this document 

16 here, which you refer to without a date, told them it 

17 wasn't okay. 

18  MR. STEWART: Well, first of all --

19  JUSTICE BREYER: I'd be rather curious if 

you could sort that out. 

21  MR. STEWART: Well, the 2000 notice that the 

22 Respondents have cited -- I think the -- the most 

23 important point to make about it is that it was the view 

24 of a single -- of the district counsel for a single 

district within the IRS.

1  JUSTICE BREYER: I -- I know there are many 

2 ways of downplaying that, but I'm just curious as to 

3 what happened. What about the one you cited? When was 

4 that?

 MR. STEWART: I don't know the exact date in 

6 2000, but it has long been established that transactions 

7 lacking economic substance and transactions motivated 

8 purely for tax avoidance purposes may be disregarded 

9 from -- by the IRS. That -- that was a pre-existing 

proposition. 

11  When we issued the notice with respect to 

12 Son-of-BOSS transactions in particular, that was simply 

13 the IRS's way of informing taxpayers that we regard this 

14 particular avoidance mechanism as encompassed by the 

general principle that transactions lacking economic 

16 substance --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, yes, that's 

18 the general principle. But the point you made just a 

19 few moments ago is -- I think is responsive to that, 

which is: We're not talking about the merits; we're 

21 talking about a statute of limitations. The whole point 

22 of a statute of limitations is some things that are bad 

23 are -- are -- are gone.

2  MR. STEWART: That's correct, and that's the 

3 proposition that the Respondents are citing the 

4 different 2000 document for. They are citing it as 

though it were a definitive statement of agency position 

6 as to the operation of the assessment period. It -- it 

7 was not that. It was a document issued by a single 

8 district counsel. And in a sense, the -- the reference 

9 to Colony as continuing to -- as though it continued to 

govern the -- the 1954 code was dictum because the 

11 district counsel, even in that document, stated that it 

12 would not be inappropriate to --

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: At what -- at what 

14 level of the IRS bureaucracy can you feel comfortable 

that the advice you're getting is correct? 

16  MR. STEWART: Well, this --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A single district 

18 counsel -- you go to there and say, what do you think? 

19 And it tells you, and you say, well, that's fine, but I 

know you don't count; so, I want to talk to your 

21 boss and boss --

22  (Laughter.) 

23  MR. STEWART: No, this is not advice to the 

24 taxpayer. That document was a memorandum from the 

district counsel to another IRS official. The other IRS

1 official was seeking guidance with regard to the 

2 question of whether we needed to get within the 3-year 

3 assessment period or whether it was appropriate to rely 

4 on the 6-year assessment period. And although the 

district counsel cited Colony in a way that it suggested 

6 that it continued to control the operation of the 1954 

7 code, the district counsel stated on the facts of this 

8 case it would not be inappropriate to rely on the --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so, what that 

-- what happened here is that the taxpayer came to the 

11 same conclusion as a district counsel of the IRS. 

12  MR. STEWART: That's correct, but not --

13 didn't come to the same conclusion as the IRS did in 

14 litigating the case in Phinney, didn't come to the same 

conclusion as the IRS did in --

16  JUSTICE BREYER: What about the -- that's

18 notice what you say about it. You said that it 

19 described "arrangements that unlawfully 'purport to 

give'" them -- if I read that piece of paper, which I 

21 might -- and you probably read it because you cited 

22 it -- will I come away with the impression, uh-oh, these 

23 loophole arrangements, Son of BOSS, which previously 

24 seemed to be okay are now not okay? Is that the 

impression I'll have?

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Is that the impression you

4  MR. STEWART: That notice would not say --

tell you anything relevant to the computation of the 

6 assessment period. 

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. All right. That's 

8 what I suspect. Then look at the unfairness of this. 

9 I'm not saying there aren't worse unfairnesses in the 

world, but, nonetheless, people spent a lot of money. 

11 The whole Bar has gone to an enormous effort. 

12 Everything up through 2000 being -- seems to say you can 

13 do this. You have a case on point in the Supreme Court. 

14 And then 9 years later, after continuous litigation, the 

IRS promulgates a regulation which tries to reach back 

16 and capture people who filed their return 9 years 

17 before. 

18  MR. STEWART: Again, I'm not quite sure what 

19 you mean by saying: would seem to say that you could do 

this. I don't think that there were any affirmative IRS 

21 statements that could lead people to believe that the 

22 Son-of-BOSS mechanism was okay, but what --

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you clarify, 

24 Mr. Stewart, two things that Justice Breyer brought up? 

One, he said that the IRS had given people advice that 

23

20

25

Official 

1 Son of BOSS was okay; it would work -- this tax shelter, 

2 this tax scheme, would work. 

3  And then he said -- he suggested that a 

4 basis is like deductions. And you agree that 

overstatement of deductions don't get you the longer
 

6 statute of limitations. So, why -- why should an
 

7 inflated basis get you to 6 years when inflated
 

8 deductions don't? That's one question.
 

9  And the other question is, is it so, that
 

agents told people that Son of BOSS would work? Is --

11  MR. STEWART: No. No, it's not true that 

12 the IRS had advised people that Son-of-BOSS transactions 

13 were okay. It wasn't until 2000 that the IRS issued a 

14 specific document that said, as a matter of agency 

policy, they're not okay. But, again, that document was 

16 just a kind of case-specific application of the more 

17 general -- of the more general proposition that 

18 transactions lacking economic substance can be 

19 disregarded.

 With respect to why the overstatement of 

21 basis is treated differently from the overstated 

22 deduction, that follows inexorably from the language of 

23 the code. That is, Congress defined the conduct that 

24 would trigger the general rule as an omission from gross 

income, and because of the way that gross income is 

24
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 defined, an overstatement of basis can lead to an 

2 understatement of gain, which in turn is taken into 

3 account in computing gross income. A deduction may 

4 ultimately affect taxable income, but it doesn't affect 

gross income. And so, there would be no way of reading 

6 the statute to encompass that. 

7  Now, as to why Congress would have done 

8 this, I think a clue is furnished by subparagraph Roman 

9 (ii), which is at the bottom of page 1a, and it says: 

"In determining the amount omitted from gross income, 

11 there shall not be taken into account any amount which 

12 is omitted from gross income stated in the return if 

13 such amount is disclosed in the return, or in a 

14 statement attached to the return, in a manner adequate 

to apprise the Secretary of the nature and amount of 

16 such item." 

17  And so, that provides a safe harbor that 

18 says even if you fall within the general rule, even if 

19 you understated your gross income by more than 

25 percent, if, at some point in the return, you gave 

21 the IRS adequate information to notice that the 

22 misstatement had taken place, you will be off the hook 

23 for the 6-year assessment period. 

24  And I think that is highly relevant in 

responding to the policy concern that Justice Harlan 

25

25

Official 

1 identified in Colony. That is, Justice Harlan said the 

2 reason we think that Congress intended to restrict the 

3 statute to situations where an item is left off the 

4 return altogether is that those would be the most 

difficult for the IRS to catch; the IRS would be placed 

6 at a special disadvantage. 

7  Here in subparagraph (ii), Congress has 

8 accomplished the same intent but through a different 

9 mechanism. That is, it's made the general rule sweep 

more broadly but given taxpayers an out where the 

11 disclosures are adequate. 

12  If I could reserve the balance of my time. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just on that point -- and 

14 we'll find out in a minute -- is the Respondent going to 

say, well, it's always implicit that you have a basis; 

16 everybody knows you have a basis? 

17  MR. STEWART: I don't think that --

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, that's -- so, that's 

19 necessarily what you're telling the government.

 MR. STEWART: I don't think he will say --

21 I don't want to speculate too much on what he will say, 

22 but I think his position is an overstatement of basis 

23 could never trigger the assessment period because the 

24 item of gross receipts would have been adequately 

disclosed.

4  ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

6  MR. GARRE: Your Honor, our position is the 

7 one that the Court reached in Colony, which is that an 

8 overstatement of basis is not an omission from gross 

9 income. What the Court held in Colony was that an 

omission -- an omission from gross income is where you 

11 leave out a specific taxable item or receipt. 

12  We think the court of appeals got it right 

13 when it concluded that the statute of limitations on the 

14 statute -- on the tax assessments at issue expired in 

2003 and rejected the IRS's extraordinary efforts to 

16 avoid that result by discombobulating this Court's 

17 decision in Colony and by seeking to retroactively 

18 reopen and extend the statute of limitations. 

19  What the Government relies on principally is 

the addition of subparagraph (i) in the code, and that 

21 was added in 1954, before the Court's decision in 1958. 

22 And I'd like to make a few points about subparagraph (i) 

23 because I think it's the crux of the Government's 

24 position.

 The first is just the anomaly of their 

27

Official 

1 argument, that by adding this subparagraph -- and it's 

2 on page 1a of the addendum to the red brief -- which 

3 explicates the definition of "gross income" in one 

4 specific context, the sale -- the cost of goods or 

services by a trade or business, Congress meant to 

6 change the general rule -- and that's what it called it, 

7 the "general rule" -- in subsection (A). 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, why do you think they 

9 added that paragraph? Because it seems clear that there 

was a circuit split at that time about exactly this 

11 question and that this paragraph was a response to that 

12 circuit split. So, what else could Congress have meant 

13 by it? 

14  MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, I think that's 

probably right. It thought it was agreeing with the 

16 taxpayer side of the circuit split. There's legislative 

17 history indicating that it also thought it was 

18 addressing the computational rule of how to get gross 

19 income, which factors into the 25 percent trigger.

 I think what maybe is most important is that 

21 this Court in Colony looked at the 1954 amendments at 

22 the suggestion of the government and concluded that its 

23 decision was consistent with the 1954 amendments. 

24 That's in the last line of the decision.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were most of the --

Official 

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's got to mean --

2 that's got to refer to (i). It can't refer to the --

3 Harlan said two things. He said it's ambiguous; 

4 therefore, I'm going to look at the legislative history 

to find out what the predecessor section means. 

6  And then he says: I'm not going to 

7 speculate on what this new thing means, but I do want to 

8 point out that the result we reach in Colony is in 

9 harmony with the unambiguous language of 6501, et 

cetera. The only unambiguous language that he could be 

11 referring to is in (i) because he has just -- he had 

12 said the earlier language was ambiguous. 

13  MR. GARRE: Well, I don't -- I don't think 

14 so, Your Honor. First of all, you're right, he referred 

to the whole 6501(e)(1)(A), which includes both 

16 subsections. It's not clear that he was identifying 

17 subparagraph (i). He could have well been referring to 

18 subparagraph (ii), along the lines of what my friend 

19 just spelled out, because much of the Colony decision 

was based on addressing the situation where the -- where 

21 the IRS is at a special disadvantage because something's 

22 been left out entirely. And that really kind of gets to 

23 the heart of subparagraph (ii). 

24  But the anomaly of the Government's 

construction here today is that Colony would come out 

29
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 differently, because Colony doesn't involve a taxpayer 

2 involved in the sale of goods or service; it involved a 

3 taxpayer in the sale of real property. So, even though 

4 this Court in Colony said --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- real estate developer 

6 in the business of buying and selling property. So, I'm 

7 not sure that I buy your argument that it can't be goods 

8 and services, because that was the services of this 

9 particular company.

 MR. GARRE: Your Honor, the sale of real 

11 property, whether in parcels or otherwise, has always 

12 been treated differently than the sale of -- costs of 

13 goods or services, which really is a term of art. And 

14 if you go back at Colony, you can see that the Court 

referred to basis, referred to property, and that's 

16 precisely the way that the parties did in their brief. 

17 The Solicitor General in its own brief framed the 

18 question presented as overstatement of basis in the sale 

19 of property.

 That's the situation that we have here 

21 today. The subparagraph (i) they're referring to is 

22 addressed to the specific situation of a trade or 

23 business involved in the sale of costs of goods or 

24 services --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I --

30

25

Official 

1  MR. GARRE: -- which is different. 

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to ask in 

3 conjunction with Justice Kagan's discussion, were the 

4 pre-Colony cases that involved splits -- did most of 

those or any of those relate to the sales of goods and 

6 services or were they all real estate sales? Do --

7  MR. GARRE: Your Honor, the Uptegrove case 

8 did, the Third Circuit case. But they involved -- the 

9 fact is they involved both the sale of property and the 

sale of goods and services. And at that time, no one 

11 was drawing this bright-line distinction. 

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but the Congress 

13 drew it, as I think is implicit in Justice Kagan's 

14 question, when it talks just about goods and services.

 MR. GARRE: It did do that. There was one 

16 reason for Congress to address that specific situation, 

17 in that there was a regulation that had defined "gross 

18 income" differently. It's appended at the end of our 

19 brief, and it was discussed in Uptegrove. So, there was 

a reason to single that out. But I think the more --

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the other reason, it 

22 was goods and services. There's always FIFO and LIFO. 

23 I mean, there's -- you know, taxpayers who sell goods 

24 have inventory cushions. And so, the IRS is very, very 

well aware that that kind of judgment is involved in all 

31
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 these statements. It's not quite the same with basis. 

2  MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, I think it's 

3 the opposite, if I understand your question, which is 

4 that taxpayers typically put more information which is 

going to put the IRS on notice when you're dealing with 

6 basis and the sale of property as opposed to the costs 

7 of goods and services, which involve many transactions 

8 and you're dealing with them in the aggregate. When 

9 you're dealing with the sale of property, as in Colony 

and here, you're dealing with specific disclosures as to 

11 the basis. 

12  Here, if you look on page 151 of the JA, it 

13 lays out the adjustment in the basis. And the same was 

14 true in Colony. And so, to the extent that there's a 

distinction there, I think it cuts in favor of the 

16 taxpayer. 

17  The problem for the Government is all of the 

18 amendments in 1954 were pro-taxpayer amendments as 

19 relevant here; and yet, the Government's conclusion is 

that by adding this subsection addressing the specific 

21 situation, it meant to take away the general rule in a 

22 way that hurt taxpayers. It's inconsistent with what 

23 this Court said in Colony because the Court --

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, why would they be 

redundant? I mean, if the statute without little (i) 

32
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

25

Official 

1 meant what you said it meant, then there would be no 

2 occasion to put this in, because "omission from gross 

3 income" would refer to items of income, period. That's 

4 -- so, what work does (i) do, if it just -- if the main 

rule, the general rule, is as you say it is? 

6  MR. GARRE: Your Honor, everyone agrees it's 

7 not redundant, even the Government, because what it does 

8 is, at a minimum, it has a computational effect of 

9 affecting the 25 percent trigger. The amount to get to 

the trigger has to be --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: But you agree that that's 

12 not why Congress passed that provision? 

13  MR. GARRE: Well, it's not clear, Justice 

14 Kagan. The -- the Federal Circuit in the Salman Ranch 

case cited legislative history that suggested it was 

16 trying to achieve just that result. But I think the 

17 broader point I would make is it's not at all uncommon 

18 for Congress to act to provide an answer to a specific 

19 situation that had come up by explicating it. And yet, 

one doesn't conclude that, in doing that, it's intended 

21 to overstate -- override the entire general rule that's 

22 stated, particularly where it doesn't touch the language 

23 that's the subject of the general rule. Congress didn't 

24 in any way touch the phrase interpreted in Colony, 

"omission from gross income." 

33

1  And the anomaly gets even greater if you 

2 look at Congress's actions after Colony. In 1965, 

3 Congress amended the heading. Now, granted it's only a 

4 heading, but it amended it, the heading to the 

subsection, to mean "Substantial omission of items,"
 

6 which is perfectly consistent with Colony's
 

7 interpretation, directly contrary to the Government's
 

8 interpretation.
 

9  In 1982, Congress re-enacted the same
 

language, "omission from gross income," found in the 

11 provision at issue in Colony in 26 U.S.C. 6229, which is 

12 the provision for partnerships. And yet, it omitted the 

13 subparagraph (i) that the Government relies upon as the 

14 transformative provision narrowing the general rule. 

And so, why on earth would -- would Congress omit that 

16 subparagraph if it did the transformative work that the 

17 Government suggests? 

18  The Government doesn't have a response 

19 except to say that they have to be interpreted the same 

way, which makes no sense given the emphasis it's 

21 placing on subparagraph (i). I think the answer is, is 

22 subparagraph (i) just doesn't have and was never 

23 intended to have the transformative effect that the 

24 Government suggests.

 Whatever -- we can talk about what the Court

1 meant in Colony, but I do think that it's critically 

2 important that Colony is entitled to full stare decisis 

3 effect. In fact, it's stare decisis coupled with 

4 Congressional re-enactment. The Government describes 

the world after Colony, but the fact is, if you go back 

6 and look, no one thought that Colony was just a ship 

7 passing the night that had only retrospective 

8 significance. Everybody, including the IRS, appreciated 

9 that Colony was a landmark decision.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Garre, where do 

11 you find evidence of that? Because you cite some cases 

12 in your brief that end up not really supporting your 

13 position. And as far as I can see, there's only one 

14 case after Colony that deals with the question of 

whether Colony continues to govern after the 1954 

16 amendments. And that case, which is Phinney, seems to 

17 cut in the opposite direction. So, am I missing 

18 something? Are there cases that -- that favor you that 

19 say that, yes, Colony continued to control?

 MR. GARRE: I think what my response would 

21 be first as to Phinney, the Fifth Circuit has clarified 

22 that the Government's construction of Phinney is just 

23 wrong. Phinney was consistent with the Colony rule. It 

24 dealt with a particular application of it.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, whatever the Fifth 

35

Official 

1 Circuit said about Phinney, when I read Phinney, it 

2 seems to me to cut in the Government's direction if not 

3 to be entirely on all fours. But I asked, are there any 

4 other cases that you have that suggest that the courts 

did think that Colony was continuing to be the governing 

6 rule? 

7  MR. GARRE: If I could make one point on 

8 Phinney, and then I'll address the other cases. I would 

9 ask you to look at the Solicitor General's opposition 

brief in Phinney, which recognized that Colony was the 

11 governing principle. One would think that the 

12 Government thought that Colony was just a shot in time, 

13 had no ongoing significance, they would have said that 

14 in the opposition brief in Phinney. The Solicitor 

General accepted Colony as the governing rule, as 

16 everyone did. 

17  As to the cases, I think it's fair to say 

18 that, no, we can't point to a case in the 1950s, '60s, 

19 or '70s where they specifically confronted the question 

before the Court today. But what I -- what I -- what I 

21 can say is look at the cases that we cite in our brief, 

22 and all of those cases discuss this Court's opinion in 

23 Colony as if it continues to have lasting effect on the 

24 interpretation of the "omits from gross income." And 

yet, in the Government's -- the IRS's own internal

1 documents -- we cite two, 1976 and 2000 -- where the IRS 

2 internally is treating Colony as a landmark decision 

3 which controls on a current going-forward basis. 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Because what I was thinking, 

Mr. Garre -- and tell me what you think the consequence 

6 of this would be -- is that if I were a tax lawyer and 

7 somebody came to me and said is Colony still the rule, I 

8 would have said: Well, I can't tell you 100 percent. I 

9 think you're good 70 to 80 percent. You know, it's the 

same language, and there's Colony out there, and -- and 

11 -- and nothing the IRS hasn't said that Colony doesn't 

12 control, but I can't -- so, I'm giving a 70 percent. 

13  Do you win if that's the state of the world 

14 as I see it?

 MR. GARRE: Well, I don't know how you would 

16 put a percentage on -- on, in effect, whether Colony was 

17 a "step one" case or not. I mean --

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, in terms of what a 

19 taxpayer thinks, whether Colony continues to govern.

 MR. GARRE: I think so. I mean, I think, 

21 you know, the IRS's actions here really put taxpayers in 

22 an extraordinary situation. I mean, they're taking a 

23 decision of this Court that says an overstatement of 

24 basis -- no, that's not an omission of gross income. 

They're relying on the 1954 amendments to get around

1 that. Look at the Colony decision. The Colony decision

3 perfectly consistent with those. 

4  And here comes the Government --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it also said before 

6 that, Mr. Garre, and without doing more than noting the 

7 speculative debate between the parties as to whether 

8 Congress manifested an intention to clarify or --

9 clarify or change the 1939 code. So, not taking a 

position on whether the new section changes the code. 

11 And the part that is in harmony -- I can't see how that 

12 could be read to mean anything other than the (i), which 

13 is unambiguous and certainly in harmony with the result 

14 in Colony.

 MR. GARRE: Justice Ginsburg, the government 

16 in Colony argued that the 1954 amendments compelled its 

17 interpretation, which was the one that the Court 

18 rejected. If -- if this Court -- this Court must have 

19 considered that argument in reaching the opposite 

conclusion. I think -- I think you're right, that it's 

21 fair to describe that language as dictum. But this 

22 Court has many times said that even if something is 

23 dictum, if it explicates the Court -- Court's holding, 

24 the lower courts and this Court would give it great 

weight in its --

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But as I read it, it 

2 isn't saying and Colony controls; it's saying we're not 

3 going to take a position on what the 1954 code does, 

4 whether it clarifies or changes.

 MR. GARRE: I think that the prefatory 

6 language there -- I think -- I think you're right. 

7 That's a fair characterization. But, ultimately, what 

8 the Court said was its holding was in harmony with the 

9 new statute. And you can't reach that conclusion if you 

agree with the Government's interpretation. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he says "unambiguous 

12 language," and he can't mean the general rule because 

13 he's already said that is ambiguous. He's got to mean 

14 the new provision, which is certainly unambiguous.

 MR. GARRE: I don't think it has to be (i), 

16 Your Honor. I think it could be subsection (ii). We 

17 don't know which one he was referring to. And the 

18 reason why it could be subsection (ii) is because a 

19 great deal of the Court's analysis dealt with the -- the 

question whether the Commissioner was at a disadvantage. 

21  I would like to address the rationale in 

22 Colony. My friend has referred --

1  Under our current regime, can you ever give 

2 more than a 70 percent chance? Because you have, in the 

3 absence of a definitive Supreme Court ruling, the IRS 

4 can reach a different result and it can do that 

retroactively. So, I mean, you don't disagree with 

6 that, right? I mean, if we determine that Colony was 

7 ambiguous, the IRS can change the rule in Colony, and it 

8 can apply that rule, new rule, retroactively. That's 

9 what our cases say, right?

 MR. GARRE: Well, we do disagree with it --

11 I mean, I certainly accept the Brand X part of that. 

12 What we disagree with is that (a) the IRS has the 

13 authority to retroactively apply an interpretation of a 

14 statute, which gets to the meaning of 7805(b)(1); and 

(b) whether or not the regulation in this case on its 

16 face applies it retroactively. But I accept --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, they can't -- they 

18 can't change the interpretation of the statute, but they 

19 are the agency with expertise to define a term within a 

statute. Why don't they have the expertise to define 

21 either what the words "gross income" mean or don't mean? 

22  MR. GARRE: Well, they don't have any leeway 

23 to overturn this Court's decision if that decision 

24 specifically addressed the question. And that's the 

language of Chevron, and as it turns --

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: No, and if it is --

2 according to Brand X, if it specifically addressed the 

3 question and said that there was no ambiguity. But 

4 according to Brand X, if there's ambiguity, despite a 

holding of this Court, the agency can effectively 

6 overrule a holding by a regulation, right? Isn't that 

7 what Brand X says? 

8  MR. GARRE: Brand X says that --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, the only question here 

is, as the Chief Justice put it, whether -- whether 

11 indeed Colony meant by "ambiguous" ambiguous. 

12  MR. GARRE: I --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what the 

14 meaning of "ambiguous" is, right?

 (Laughter.) 

16  MR. GARRE: I don't think so, for this 

17 reason: Because Colony -- at the beginning of the 

18 Court's decision, Justice Harlan in a gracious way, as 

19 the Chief suggested, pointed out that there could be 

some ambiguity in the text. But then he went on to 

21 apply the traditional tools of statutory construction. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: But I can hardly even think 

23 of a statutory interpretation question that we've gotten 

24 that doesn't involve some degree of ambiguity, if we're 

honest about it. We take a case where there's a

1 conflict in the courts of appeals. And so, there was at 

2 least enough ambiguity in those cases for one or more 

3 courts of appeals to come to an interpretation that's 

4 contrary to the one that we ultimately reach. So, what 

degree of ambiguity is Brand X referring to? 

6  MR. GARRE: Well, I would -- I would think 

7 that Brand X refers back to Chevron and looks to the 

8 first step of Chevron. Brand -- what Brand X is looking 

9 to is whether or not -- it's really a step one or step 

two case. And on step one, Chevron looks to whether 

11 Congress has addressed the specific question presented. 

12 And if you look at the Court's decision in Colony, what 

13 Justice Harlan said was Congress was addressing itself 

14 to the specific situation where a taxpayer actually 

omitted some income receipt or accrual in his 

16 computation of gross income, and not --

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that was the specific 

18 situation, but then the question was, how clearly did 

19 Congress speak to that specific situation? And in order 

to get his result, Justice Harlan says first that the 

21 statute is -- that the statutory text is ambiguous, goes 

22 to a bunch of legislative history, and none of that 

23 legislative history actually speaks to the exact 

24 question before the Court, only by implication.

 So, if you look at the whole of -- of the

1 Colony opinion, it sure seems as though there's a lot of 

2 extrapolation going on and essentially a lot of

4  MR. GARRE: Well, I would disagree with 

that, respectfully, Your Honor. I think the -- the 

6 holding of the Court -- and, again, it's entitled to 

7 stare decisis effect even if this Court might approach 

8 it differently today under different modes of statutory 

9 construction or otherwise. The holding of the Court was 

that Congress addressed the specific situation of 

11 whether an overstatement of basis was an omission from 

12 gross income, and the Court said no. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, in the end, there has 

14 to be a resolution. But the question is, what does it 

look like before you get to that resolution? And -- and 

16 Justice Harlan is doing a lot of tap dancing there, you 

17 know, going to this Senate report, going to that House 

18 report, going to this colloquy, before he can come up 

19 with an answer.

 MR. GARRE: He was employing the traditional 

21 tools of statutory construction, not just legislative 

22 history. He talked about the structure and purpose and 

23 the patent tax incongruities created by the government's 

24 position that an overstatement --

3  MR. GARRE: And that's a tool of statutory 

4 construction.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you on that. 

6 The -- and I agree with Justice Scalia, actually. There 

7 are many different kinds of ambiguity, and the question 

8 is, is this of the kind where the agency later would 

9 come and use its expertise? And you're saying here it 

was up to the Congress and looking at what they had in 

11 mind. 

12  All right. Maybe that's the base -- best 

13 ground, but suppose it turns out a majority think you're 

14 not right on that. Okay? Now, here's my question: 

Assuming you're wrong on that, which I'm not sure you 

16 are, but assuming you're wrong, now we get to this 

17 regulation. Here is my problem: One -- I have no doubt 

18 at some level it seems rather unfair, but that instinct 

19 is not enough. The question is what -- what's the law?

 (A) You can say the word "open" doesn't 

21 include this case. But we run into the problem that an 

22 agency has great authority to construe its own 

23 regulation. 

24  (B) You could say that, well, there's this 

statute out there that says don't apply it, and there

1 are two routes there. One is something to do with 

2 language, which I think you can think of, which seems to 

3 cut very much against you if read naturally, but you can 

4 strain it to read it in your favor. And the other has 

to do with a parenthetical where, once again, although 

6 they left it out of their brief and they put in 

7 ellipses, I can see why they left it out because when 

8 you read it it's again ambiguous. We run into the same 

9 problem.

 Then you could say: Well, they're not 

11 supposed to do these things retroactively, either on 

12 common law administrative law grounds or something like 

13 that; they shouldn't do it; it's unfair. 

14  And they'll say: But, you see, it wasn't 

that unfair; a child of 2 would have known this was a 

16 loophole. That's how they would have characterized it. 

17 And the IRS never said anything, except for one district 

18 director in a different district that really encouraged 

19 or underwrote this kind of thing. So, it's not nearly 

as unfair as you think. If you live by loopholes, 

21 you'll die by regulation. You know, something like 

22 that.

2  MR. GARRE: Well, I think you would first 

3 look at the language of the regulation and see whether 

4 or not --

JUSTICE BREYER: "Open," that's the term. 

6  MR. GARRE: -- by its terms, it applies 

7 retroactively. This Court has made clear, it made clear 

8 in the Bowen case, that it's not retroactively unless 

9 there's a clear -- not retroactive unless there's a 

clear statement of retroactivity. And our position is, 

11 whatever else is true, that what the effective date 

12 provision says and the preamble says, it's just unclear 

13 about whether it's retroactive or not. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: I never thought that a 

revision of a statute of limitation was retroactive 

16 legislation, just as I've never thought that a provision 

17 altering rules of evidence for a crime, even for crimes 

18 that were committed before that alteration, is 

19 retroactive legislation.

 MR. GARRE: Well, I --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, the crucial date 

22 is the date -- at least it's not -- well, you can extend 

23 the statute of limitations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So, say it's unfair, but 

6 I'm not sure that the rule against -- presumption 

7 against retroactivity technically applies. 

8  MR. GARRE: Well, again, I mean, I think if 

9 you look at Landgraf and the cases talking about what is 

retroactive, this regulation here if it is applied 

11 retroactivity -- retroactively has the consequence this 

12 Court points to as the worst kind of retroactivity, 

13 which is extinguishing a valid defense in litigation and 

14 imposing new consequences for past actions. Hughes 

Aircraft recognizes that, as do the many courts of 

16 appeals that we've cited in our brief. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Presumptively because 

18 you're saying that this is a new interpretation. But 

19 the IRS is taking the position that the meaning hasn't 

changed --

21  MR. GARRE: Well --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that it's just 

23 clarifying some ambiguity that the courts have had; not 

24 that it's had.

1 law in 2003 when the statute of limitations expired was 

2 Colony. Even if the Court -- the agency had leeway to 

3 reinterpret it, it's changing the law. And the reason 

4 why it's doing that is it's doing it retrospectively.

 If you look at cases like Brand X, the 

6 theory is you have one interpretation, and then the 

7 agency going forward can have another one. In Brand X, 

8 the agency sought to apply its -- its new interpretation 

9 prospectively. Here, it's doing retrospectively, and 

when it does that, it changes the law. Maybe the 

11 concrete example of that is --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's too many 

13 presumptions in your answer. The first is that Colony 

14 controlled --

MR. GARRE: No, no --

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what to me itself 

17 says it's not -- it's not interpreting the new 

18 statute --

19  MR. GARRE: My point on that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- whatever its footnote 

21 meant. 

22  MR. GARRE: No, my point on that was not 

23 that Colony controlled as a step one matter; it's that 

24 even if the Government is right that Colony just said 

this is one permissible reading, it was the law as the

1 -- it was the permissible reading and the law until the 

2 government changed it. And the government didn't change 

3 it, try to change it, until 2009. The statute of 

4 limitations in this case expired in 2003.

 And so, if the government can adopt a new 

6 interpretation going forward, the question is, can it 

7 apply that interpretation retrospectively during the 

8 time frame in this case? And our position on that is 

9 that they certainly haven't done so unambiguously. And 

that -- as this Court said in St. Cyr, ambiguity means 

11 unambiguous prospectivity. And the Court also 

12 rejected --

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you -- do you understand 

14 the preamble as part of the regulation? Because if I 

look at the preamble, the preamble seems pretty clear to 

16 me. It seems to me that your view that the government 

17 did not do this clearly enough must rest on looking at 

18 the regulation without the preamble. 

19  MR. GARRE: No. No. I mean, the Court 

could -- I mean, certainly, we think you'd go first to 

21 the regulation. And it says "was open." The preamble 

22 says, quote, this is "not retroactive." It says it does 

23 not apply to open tax -- it only applies to open tax 

24 years, and not to reopen closed tax years. That's on 75 

Federal Register 78,898. The government -- the way that 

49

25

Official 

1 the government gets there is to say that, well, even
 

2 though we've passed the regulation long after the
 

3 statute of limitations expired, because this case is
 

4 pending, we can apply the new interpretation in
 

determining whether the period closed long before we
 

6 passed this regulation.
 

7  At a minimum, that's -- that's a highly
 

8 strained, if not convoluted, way to get around
 

9 retroactivity.


 The way that the regulation's effective date 

11 and the preamble speaks about whether this is 

12 retroactive or not is really kind of nonsensical. And I 

13 think, at a minimum, the taxpayer ought to get the 

14 benefit of that, and this Court should say that if the 

government really wants to do -- take the extraordinary 

16 step that it's taken here to retroactively reopen a 

17 statute of limitations, it ought to do so in clear terms 

18 and not the convoluted way it's done here. 

19  We also think that the -- the IRS just 

lacked the authority to -- to legislate, to -- to pass a 

21 new interpretation on a statute retroactively. That 

22 gets to the meaning of 7805 and whether -- which says 

23 regulations relating to a statutory provision enacted 

24 after the '96 legislation which purported to strip the 

IRS of authority to act retroactively, whether the

Official 

1 "enacted after" clause modifies "regulation" or
 

2 "statute." And we think, in context, it must modify
 

3 "regulation" because there's two types of IRS
 

4 regulations: regulations relating to statutes and
 

regulations relating to IRS internal practices.
 

6  And what Congress said is internal
 

7 practices -- sure, you can operate retroactively when
 

8 appropriate. With respect to new interpretations of
 

9 statutes, not retroactive. That was landmark
 

legislation as part of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: I take your point about the 

12 purpose, but you would have to ignore every rule of 

13 grammar that there is in order to read it your way, 

14 don't -- wouldn't you?

 MR. GARRE: Not if you read "regulations 

16 which relate to statutory provisions" as -- as one 

17 thing. Regulations which relate to statutory provisions 

18 as opposed to regulations which relate to IRS 

19 provisions. And if you look at the legislative history, 

it's clear Congress was thinking about that distinction. 

21 If you do read that as one unit, then the "enacted on or 

22 after" obviously modifies that. 

23  I think you have to look at it in context 

24 and in light of the purpose of it, to get to that 

conclusion. But courts have adopted that conclusion.

1 The American Council on -- American College of Tax 

2 Counsel lays out those cases. 

3  We think Judge Wilkinson got it right when 

4 he referred to the IRS's position in this case as "an 

inversion of the universe" and concluded that accepting 

6 IRS's position would stretch accepted administrative 

7 deference principles beyond their logical and 

8 constitutional limit. 

9  The IRS has the tools of its -- at its 

disposal to identify tax deficiency and to take 

11 appropriate action timely. Congress acted in 2004 to 

12 respond to the precise situation precipitating this case 

13 with Son-of-BOSS transactions. It amended 6501 not by 

14 changing the meaning of what's an omission from gross 

income, but by adopting a new provision which requires 

16 taxpayers involved in listed transactions like Son of 

17 BOSS to report many additional things, and saying that 

18 the statute of limitations did not apply at all if they 

19 didn't make those reporting requirements.

 So, going forward, the only impact of the 

21 Court's decision in this case is going to apply to 

22 everyday regular taxpayers who simply erroneously 

23 misstate or overstate the basis in the sale of a home or

12  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

13  MR. STEWART: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

14  I'd like to make three quick points.

 First, Mr. Garre refers to the amended 

16 heading of section -- subsection 6501(e), which now 

17 states "Substantial omission of items," but I think the 

18 heading simply points up the fact that some provisions 

19 within subsection (e) refer to amounts and some to 

items. Subsection (e)(2), which deals with estate and 

21 gift taxes, refers to omission of items. 

22  And the legislative history makes clear that 

23 Congress chose that term precisely to make clear that 

24 the understatement -- or the overstatement or 

understatement of an item that was reported will not

1 give rise to the extended period. 

2  The second thing is that, at bottom, 

3 Respondents argue that the -- that the phrase "amount of 

4 gross income" should be construed to mean item of gross 

receipts. And they don't offer any real textual 

6 argument as to why that would be a sound reading. 

7 Really, they rely exclusively on Colony. But the Court 

8 in Colony said, at the beginning of its opinion, that it 

9 was pronouncing only on the 1939 code. It said at the 

end of its opinion that it was not generally trying to 

11 construe the 1954 code. 

12  And it stated that the relevant -- the most 

13 relevant language was not unambiguous. And I think the 

14 recognition of ambiguity is relevant in part because it 

sets up our Brand X argument, but it's also relevant 

16 because saying that a particular snippet of language is 

17 ambiguous is to recognize that its meaning may vary 

18 depending on context. And the --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Stewart, I know 

you've got a -- your third point, and I want to let you 

21 get it out, but you mentioned Brand X. Have we ever 

22 applied Brand X to one of our decisions? Have we ever 

23 said an agency by regulation can alter and change one --

24 a Supreme Court decision?

 MR. STEWART: No. I mean, Brand X was the

1 first case that announced the Brand X principle, and the 

2 Court has not applied it since.

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that was 

applying it to a court of appeals decision. 

6  MR. STEWART: That was applying it to a 

7 court of appeals decision. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. We've never 

9 said an agency can change what we've said the law means.

 MR. STEWART: No. Justice Stevens wrote a 

11 separate opinion in Brand X, suggesting that it might 

12 not apply to decisions of this Court, but the Court as a 

13 whole did not pronounce on that. 

14  And then the third point I would want to 

make is that Mr. Garre referred to cases and one IRS 

16 General Counsel opinion that were issued during the 

17 period between 1958 and 2000 that applied Colony to the 

18 current statute, but they did so in a very specific way. 

19 That is, they relied on the aspects of Colony that 

talked about Congress's purpose to reserve the extended 

21 assessment period for cases in which the IRS was at a 

22 special disadvantage due to inadequate disclosure. And 

23 those cases applied that language in elucidating current 

24 subparagraph (ii), which provides a safe harbor in cases 

of adequate disclosure.
