 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in case 07-1372, Hawaii 

versus the Office of Hawaiian Affairs.

 General Bennett.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. MARK J. BENNETT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BENNETT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 A 1993 congressional apology resolution did 

not alter Hawaii's right to transfer its public lands or 

repeal, by implication, prior congressional enactments 

that it extinguish all competing claims to those lands. 

It was, as its sponsor said at the time, a simple 

apology, and no more.

 The lands in question were the former Crown 

and government lands of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The 

Republic of Hawaii was the successor in interest and 

ownership to those lands and was recognized as such by 

the United States. The 1898 Newlands Resolution of 

Annexation recited that the Republic of Hawaii was 

ceding the absolute fee ownership of those lands to the 

United States, and that that cession was accepted, 

ratified and confirmed. Once the United States Congress

so acted, all competing claims to title were 

extinguished, and under precedent going back almost 

200 years, the determinations by Congress to accept the 

cession were final and conclusive on any court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Excuse me. Does that 

proposition settle the question whether your opponents 

have equitable interest in the lands?

 MR. BENNETT: Your Honor, what the 

Respondents have contended from day one in this case is 

that they have a property right in this -- in the land, 

and the Newlands Resolution conclusively settled that 

question. There is no property interest that could have 

competed with the United States as perfect title. That 

perfect title was passed to the State of Hawaii in 1959 

through the 1959 Hawaii Admission Act.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But would the state of 

Hawaii, under Hawaii law, be entitled to take the 

position, if it so chose, that as the new owner of the 

lands, it has a special duty as a trustee that some 

other owner might not?

 MR. BENNETT: Your Honor, the Admission Act 

gives the State the right to manage and dispose of the 

lands according to State law. So the political branches 

certainly have the right to decide which lands they are 

going to use for which of the five purposes --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then -- then it's just 

a question of whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court --

assuming that it made the decision that I hypothetically 

stated -- whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court, as opposed 

to Hawaiian legislature, could make the determination of 

whether or not there is some special trust obligation 

imposed on the State of Hawaii by reason of its own 

duties.

 MR. BENNETT: But, Your Honor, in this case 

what Respondents urged was that the Apology Resolution 

changed the legal landscape and commanded the State to 

hold these lands possibly in perpetuity without 

alienation. The Hawaii Supreme Court specifically found 

that the Apology Resolution dictated the results here, 

that plaintiffs claims did not even arise until the 

Apology Resolution was signed into law by President 

Clinton. In addition, the plaintiffs -- the Respondents 

urged upon the Hawaii Supreme Court a property right, a 

property and ownership interest in these lands. Even if 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, General Bennett, if 

I understand correctly, looking to your question 

presented, the only thing before us is the effect of the 

Apology Resolution. The question presented doesn't say 

anything about the Admissions Act or the Newlands

Resolution. So shouldn't we just stick to the question 

as you presented it? Whatever the picture is, does the 

Apology Resolution have any substantive effect?

 MR. BENNETT: Your Honor, that certainly is 

one question before the Court, but we believe fairly 

included in that question is the issue of the nature of 

the State sovereign authority. The question presented 

talks about whether the Apology Resolution changed in 

any way the State's sovereign authority, and that 

question -- certainly interior and predicate to an 

intelligent resolution of that question is the nature of 

the State sovereign.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it necessary? Why 

isn't it sufficient just to say that this resolution has 

no substantive effect, period, and then remand to the 

Hawaii Supreme Court?

 MR. BENNETT: Because, Your Honor, the 

Hawaii Supreme Court's decision also rests on a premise 

foreclosed by Federal law, that is that there are 

competing claims to title. As late as page 18 of the 

red brief, Respondents even say now that Native 

Hawaiians are entitled to these lands as a matter of 

property law, but they do not say anywhere in the red 

brief how that property law claim arises or how that 

property law claim could survive the Newlands

Resolution, the Hawaii Organic Act, or the Admission 

Act.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: General, the difficulty I 

have is that not only do they not say, so the Supreme 

Court of Hawaii didn't say so either. And it seems to 

me that we would be well advised to make sure that we 

understand the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Hawaii 

before we start talking about the relationship between 

the various Federal statutes and whatever this claim may 

be. I simply don't understand the claim myself.

 I do understand your point, because I think 

this much is clear from the Hawaiian opinion: That they 

think the Apology Resolution seriously affects the 

claim. That we can deal with, but once we get out of 

that, the -- the whole case seems murky to me. Am I 

missing something?

 MR. BENNETT: Well, Your Honor, the Hawaii 

Supreme Court, at page 69a of the appendix for the 

petition, says that this was a claim seeking an 

injunction -- injunctive relief with regard to property 

rights. At page 87a of the petition appendix, the 

Hawaii Supreme Court said there are questions regarding 

the title to the State's ceded lands.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There -- there may well 

be, but then the Hawaii Supreme Court chose its grounds,

and it said at one point the resolution dictates the 

preservation of the ceded lands. At another place it 

said that Federal law provides the basis for its 

decision and that State trust law is interwoven with 

that Federal law. It also said that Federal law grounds 

the decision and provides the governing legal standards.

 Now, they could not have been clearer. They 

repeated at least five times that their decision rested 

on the resolution, that everything turned on that 

resolution having substantive effect. That's why they 

said that their decision was driven by Federal law. And 

I don't know why we shouldn't take the Hawaii Supreme 

Court at its word repeated so many times.

 MR. BENNETT: Well, Your Honor, we believe 

that Respondents' attempt to trivialize this Court's 

jurisdiction -- they say, for example, in the brief in 

opposition that even if this Court were to reverse, the 

Hawaii Supreme Court will simply reinstate the exact 

same decision, and presumably they would press upon the 

court the exact parameters they've pressed for 14 years 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: We don't --

MR. BENNETT: -- that is --

JUSTICE BENNETT: We don't know that for 

sure. It may well be, but there is a large -- large

difference, and if they're relying on Federal ground 

that insulates them from any checks by the Hawaii 

polity, but if they are forced to rely on State law, 

then it's up to the people of Hawaii whether they like 

it or not. They could change the State statutory law, 

equitable notion, constitutional law. But by doing what 

the Hawaii Supreme Court did, they have taken the case 

out of the realm of State law, subject to the political 

check, put it on Federal grounds.

 So I think that that's what -- the issue 

properly before this Court, and not anything about the 

interpretation of the Admissions Act, which -- if it's 

implicit in your question, it's a little hard to see. 

Ordinarily, if a party wants us to address the effects 

of a piece of legislation, they will mention that in the 

question presented.

 MR. BENNETT: Your Honor, I agree that this 

decision clearly rests on Federal grounds, but we would 

also suggest that the question presented talks about 

whether the State's sovereign authority is stripped, and 

the State's sovereign authority, we would submit, is 

clear.

 The United States had perfect title. The 

State of Hawaii succeeded to the United States perfect 

title. Respondents do not suggest that anywhere in

their pleadings why that is not so, or why they continue 

to press even with this Court this property right claim 

to these lands. And so we would suggest that it would 

be prudent for the Court to address what we believe is 

the fairly included question of the nature of the 

State's sovereign authority, especially as it would 

appear to be entirely not subject to contravention by 

the Respondents.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure it 

would be prudent when the great bulk of the opinion is 

based on the Apology Resolution. And I -- I certainly 

do think you have a powerful argument if the Apology 

Resolution presents us with a Federal question. But the 

more far-reaching question -- I just inferred --

suggests -- might not even be very specifically within 

the question presented, and even if it's fairly 

embraced, you used the word "prudent." It seems prudent 

for us to confine our decision to the effect of the 

Apology Resolution and whether or not the Hawaiian 

Supreme Court got that part of that right.

 MR. BENNETT: Well, with -- with respect, 

Your Honor, the Court could limit its ruling, but in a 

case that has been gone on for 14 years and which, in 

virtually every pleading, the Respondents have filed 

they have asserted essentially that the State lacks

title to these lands because the United States lacked 

title, the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii was 

illegal, and that's the precise reason for 14 years the 

State has either been through an injunction or, as a 

practical matter, not been able to alienate its lands, 

that this Court certainly has the ability for a question 

that we believe --

JUSTICE ALITO: If the Apology Resolution is 

put aside, I'm not quite sure what is left, other than 

State-law issues.

 MR. BENNETT: Well, what's left --

JUSTICE ALITO: You could -- would there be 

anything to prevent the Hawaiian legislature from 

passing a law that says, we have absolute -- we have 

title to these lands, but we are going to impose a 

five-year moratorium on any transfer of these lands 

because we want to promote a reconciliation process?

 MR. BENNETT: Your Honor, certainly under 

the terms of the Admission Act, the authority given the 

political branches for the management and disposition of 

the lands is broad and would run up against only the 

Federal common law of trust that the Ninth Circuit says 

governs --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that's not what the 

Hawaiian Supreme Court said. I am reading from page 98a

of the petition appendix, the concluding portion of the 

opinion. "We hold, number one, that the Apology 

Resolution and related state legislation give rise to 

the state's fiduciary duty."

 The only Federal statute mentioned is the 

Apology Resolution, and the rest of their reasoning 

seems to rest upon some kind of State equity law or 

trust law. Now, that trust law may ultimately be 

inconsistent with prior Federal acts, but the only --

the only thing they are disclosing right now is -- aside 

from the Apology Resolution, seems to be State trust 

law.

 MR. BENNETT: Well, Your Honor, the Hawaii 

Supreme Court did say that this is an injunction based 

on property rights. The Hawaii Supreme Court did say --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But trust law is based on 

somebody's property rights. We don't know whether they 

are talking about legal rights or equitable rights, and 

that's consistent with the statement I just read to you.

 MR. BENNETT: Well, Your Honor, at page 85-A 

of the appendix to the petition the Court said that the 

Congress recognized that native Hawaiians had 

unrelinquished claims to the ceded lands. And as a 

result of that recognition the Apology Resolution 

dictated the entry of this injunction.

We believe that clearly that is not so, but 

that this idea of unrelinquished claims is an 

unrelinquished property-right claim. This is what was 

urged upon the Hawaii Supreme Court at every stage.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But, General, I think --

with respect, I still don't know what the position of 

the Hawaiian Supreme Court is going to be if this Court 

rules that the Apology Resolution does not support the 

proposition that you just read.

 I don't know whether at that point the 

Hawaiian Supreme Court is going to say, okay, all we 

have got left to deal with now is State trust law, or 

whether they've got to pull another rabbit out of the 

hat and say, but there is -- there is some kind of -- of 

prior -- there is some kind of a -- a claim against 

which prior Federal law could not prevail.

 I don't know. And I -- that's -- that's why 

it seems to me, to -- to say the least, imprudent to 

wade into it at this point. The one thing we know that 

seems to have been significant to their decision is the 

Apology Resolution. And I think we would be wise to 

stick to that.

 MR. BENNETT: Your Honor, what our response 

would be is a simple one: That the issue of the State's 

title would in our view be undisputed. The United

States's title is perfect and indisputable, and the 

State's title is perfect and indisputable. And this 

Court has said that one of the functions in -- in cases 

where respondents claim an adequate and independent 

State-law ground is to remand the case by disabusing the 

State court of incorrect notions of what Federal law 

either permits or requires.

 JUSTICE ALITO: A point on which both you 

and your adversaries seem to agree is that the Apology 

Resolution really is not critical to the decision of the 

Hawaii Supreme Court. Because if you thought that 

simply taking the Apology Resolution off the books would 

provide an acceptable outcome from your point of view, 

you would be happy with our deciding just that narrow 

question. And your opponent explicitly says that the 

apology resolution wasn't critical to the decision of 

the Hawaii Supreme Court; isn't that true?

 MR. BENNETT: Yes, Your Honor, and they have 

not asked this court to affirm.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And isn't it true that you 

don't think that just saying the Apology Resolution did 

not change anything would be insufficient?

 MR. BENNETT: Your Honor, because it seems 

to us clear that both the respondents and Hawaii Supreme 

Court believe that there are property-right claims that

the Native Hawaiians have. And we believe those 

property-right claims are clearly inconsistent with 

Federal law, the Newlands Resolution, and the Admission 

Act, and that there is no reason for this Court not to 

reach such a clear claim.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But they don't say that --

there is nothing in the Resolution and nothing in the --

does anything in the Court's opinion or the Resolution 

say that the claims are valid? We all know they have 

claims. They have been making claims. Is there 

anything in any document I have that says the claims are 

valid claims? Maybe they are valid, and maybe they are 

not.

 MR. BENNETT: The -- the only thing is the 

position of the Respondents who assert --

JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, they think they 

are valid.

 MR. BENNETT: But I mean --

JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so since you have 

normally one group thinks they are valid; another group 

thinks they are invalid. Well, here we are. Let them 

fight it out.

 And all we can say is that this Resolution 

of the Apology doesn't really say who's right. And if 

Hawaii wants to give some more money, or whatever they

want to do, to the Native Hawaiians, that's their 

affair. What's the -- what's the problem?

 MR. BENNETT: Well, Your Honor, it is 

certainly true that the Apology Resolution does not as 

Respondents state recognize the validity of any claims, 

but federal law forecloses the validity of any claims. 

And we believe that that is a question that is fairly 

included interior to the question of whether the 

Resolution stripped Hawaii of its sovereign authority. 

It's only natural for the Court to declare what we 

believe is the indisputable proposition that Hawaii's 

sovereign authority is based on --

JUSTICE BREYER: Could the Hawaiian 

Legislature pass a law saying that the Native Hawaiians 

have claims? Those claims, because of the Federal 1950 

-- whatever it is -- are not valid any more. But that 

was pretty unfair to them. And, therefore, what we 

think we should do is the following. And then they pass 

a whole lot of things that they think would be 

appropriate to do in light of what I just said. What 

stops that?

 MR. BENNETT: Your Honor, the -- legislature 

has wide discretion in managing and disposing of the 

assets.

they had wanted to -- as I understand the Admission Act, 

it lists five purposes to any one purpose. And the 

legislature, if it so chose, could say, we want this 

property -- the proceeds from this property to be for 

the exclusive betterment of the conditions of the Native 

Hawaiians. They could. It would be up to the 

legislature to give it all to the Native Hawaiians.

 MR. BENNETT: That would not violate the

they deserve it; but, rather, we think we have to give 

it to the Native Hawaiians because it's theirs.

in the Federal trust and also has the power to sell 

those lands for the purposes Congress set out in the 

trust instrument.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you think on 

the question-presented issue? Are all of the Federal 

laws on which the Hawaii Supreme Court relied to say 

there was a cloud on the title before the court.

 MR. JAY: We think that they have been in 

the case from the beginning, and they -- they were 

clearly pressed in the State supreme court. And we 

think they are fairly encompassed in the question 

presented partly because, as General Bennett said, the 

-- the questions referenced to the State's sovereign 

authority, which necessarily includes consideration of 

the act which made Hawaii a sovereign state, the 

Admissions Act, is -- is a necessary antecedent to the 

resolution of that question.

 But also the admission in the Apology 

Resolution, itself, in the preamble on which the 

Respondents rely extensively goes into great detail 

about the Newlands Resolution and the cession of 

absolute fee and ownership by the Republic of Hawaii to 

the United States.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't see where this 

law -- where those laws get us. The -- the argument

that is made on the other side is that the Native 

Hawaiians have a moral claim to these lands, not that 

they have a property-right claim to the lands.

 And if the State of Hawaii, acting through 

any branch of its government -- and that is not a matter 

of concern to us -- says they have a moral claim to the 

land and, therefore, there should not be any land 

transfers for some period of time, what's inconsistent 

with Federal law in their doing that?

 MR. JAY: Let me answer that in two steps, 

Justice Alito. The first step is that the State's 

supreme court permanent injunction, although Respondents 

are now saying that the claims on which -- the claims on 

which -- they state are moral in nature, but a permanent 

injunction is a legal obligation and enforceable by 

contempt.

 So the State supreme court, by effectively 

locking up the lands for an indeterminant period of 

time, has treated them as -- as legally valid and has 

entered relief that is legal in nature.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is -- is it the function of 

the Hawaiian Supreme Court to declare moral obligations?

 MR. JAY: Well, Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would there be any problem 

-- certainly there is noted the legislature deems there

to be a moral obligation and gives the land away on that 

basis. But do you -- do you think there -- there might 

be some democracy problem if -- if the Supreme Court of 

Hawaii goes around pronouncing moral obligations and --

and giving away land on that basis?

 MR. JAY: Well, Justice Scalia I guess the 

second half to my answer to Justice Alito as well, which 

is that the State supreme court is not free as a matter 

of State trust law or otherwise to formulate obligations 

that don't relate to the State's obligation as trustee 

of the Federal trust --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it perfectly 

clear that's a question of State law?

 MR. JAY: I don't think so, Justice Stevens, 

because that State law has to comply with the 

limitations set out in section 5(f)of the Admissions 

Act. To be sure, the political branches operating as 

trustee of the trust have broad discretion to allocate 

lands within and among the five purposes set out in 

section 5(f).

 But what the State can't do and what in 

particular the State courts can't do in the name of 

formulating State trust law is to rely on considerations 

that are all together outside the trust. In this case, 

any consideration of the unrelinquished claims of the

Native Hawaiians would not be based on their status as 

one of the beneficiaries of the trust.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Are you saying that the 

State court couldn't do it but the legislature could?

 MR. JAY: I'm saying the -- the -- no, 

Justice Stevens. The State court can't rely, nor, I 

think, could the State legislature --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Could the legislature do 

it?

 MR. JAY: The legislature could determine 

that the wisest use of the lands today, the way that 

would best further -- promote the welfare of Native 

Hawaiians today would be not to sell it. The 

legislature certainly could do that and then could enact 

a moratorium that was consistent with that view.

 But what it can't do is treat it -- and this 

is the question Justice Scalia asked at the end of 

General Bennett's presentation -- what the State is not 

free to do is, based on claims by Native Hawaiians, not 

as beneficiaries of the section 5(f) trust, but based on 

considerations that arose before the Admissions Act was 

ever enacted, based on -- based on their status as 

competing claimants to the title of the land, give them 

an equitable, moral, or otherwise claim to lock up the 

use of the land.

The theory that the Respondents advanced in 

the state Supreme Court under the name of trust law is 

that a trustee may not, in furtherance of a trust, 

engage in an illegal act. And that is on Joint Appendix 

141A to 143A and other places in the record. And the 

illegal act they contemplate is the continued ownership 

of the lands by the State of Hawaii. So, the State 

cannot, in ostensible furtherance of the federal trust, 

rely on State law principles that presume the illegality 

of the federal trust or the illegality --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The State power -- the 

State legislative power to act depends on the validity 

of its reasoning.

 MR. JAY: Well, Justice Stevens, the 

State -- the State has given authority to act for 

particular purposes. And so, the purpose of the -- of 

the -- for which the State acts is necessarily relevant. 

The State can't act for a purpose that is not --

JUSTICE ALITO: What is the position that 

it's -- it is imposing a moratorium on land transfers 

because it thinks this is the best way to promote the 

interests of the Native Hawaiians, and part of their 

thinking is that there was an inequity done when 

absolute title was transferred to the United States and 

then to the State of Hawaii? Would that be a violation

of federal law?

 MR. JAY: I think, Justice Alito, that if 

the state made that determination with respect to the 

classic Native Hawaiians who are defined in the 

Admissions Act as -- as one of the present day 

beneficiaries of the trust, and determined that it 

was -- that that was the best way to act for the 

betterment of Native Hawaiians, which is a permissible 

trust purpose, that that would be permissible.

 But for the State to act on considerations 

that are wholly extrinsic to the trust, to treat the 

native -- the claims of Native Hawaiians as valid, even 

though they are -- and to assume a duty to the Native 

Hawaiians that has nothing to do with the State's 

obligations as trustee of the section 5(f) trust, we 

think that would be impermissible.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that doesn't seem to be 

what the Supreme Court of Hawaii has done. The Supreme 

Court of Hawaii, in effect, has said the land is tied up 

until these people who are currently negotiating, the 

State, the Native Hawaiians and -- what is it, the 

United Church of Christ, all come to a -- in effect, a 

resolution and a reconciliation.

 Whatever that means, it does not sound to me 

as though it is the recognition of a legal title claim

or indeed the validity so far as courts are concerned 

with validity of any claim the Native Hawaiians are 

making. They are just saying, no more land transfers 

until these people sit down and make up their 

differences.

 Isn't that all the court is saying at this 

point?

 MR. JAY: Well, the court said, 

Justice Souter, that there is a fiduciary obligation not 

to make these land transfers at any time until this 

indeterminate point in the future which reconciliation 

is achieved.

 But to say -- to say that that -- that they 

are not thereby pronouncing on the validity of the 

title, I think that is inconsistent with the Newlands 

Resolution.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the fact that you and 

I are having this exchange a pretty good indication that 

we don't know what they meant exactly by that? The only 

thing we can be sure of is that that thought the Apology 

Resolution had some legal significance. They said, you 

know, it's required after the Apology Resolution.

 We can say you are right or you are wrong, 

and I think we know what -- what we are talking about.

wading into an argument that you and I can't settle 

here.

 MR. JAY: Well, I wholly agree, 

Justice Souter, that the State supreme court thought 

that the Apology Resolution had significance and that 

the Apology Resolution --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: More than significance. 

I am reading the sentence that immediately follows the 

one that General Bennett brought to our attention on 

page 85A. It says, "Accordingly, the Apology Resolution 

dictates that the ceded lands should be preserved 

pending a reconciliation between the United States and 

the Native Hawaiian people."

 It is very fear language, dictates. And 

that's why I am really puzzled as how this Court has any 

business wading into any question other than telling the 

Hawaii Supreme Court either their right about what the 

resolution dictates or they are wrong, and they are 

wrong because it's a nice apology but it's without 

substantive effect.

 MR. JAY: Well, I certainly agree, 

Justice Ginsburg, that the State supreme court thought 

the Apology Resolution dictated the entry of the 

injunction, and the -- also on page 85A the State 

supreme court says that the Apology Resolution gives

rises to the -- to a fiduciary duty to Native Hawaiians.

 And it is -- it is that principle that the 

State supreme court was able to find a fiduciary duty 

and impose it on the State's trusteeship obligation, 

even though that fiduciary duty arises outside the 

section 5(f) trust. And that is why we think that the 

scope of the State -- of the State's obligation as 

trustee is within the Court's review at this stage.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The only issue properly presented in this 

case is whether the Hawaii Supreme Court concluded that 

the Apology Resolution created an affirmative federal 

obligation not to sell ceded land. In our view, it did 

not.

 The Hawaii Supreme Court held only that the 

sale of ceded lands would breach the State's fiduciary 

duty to Native Hawaiians under State law. And it relied 

on the Apology Resolution only for its recognition that 

Native Hawaiians have claims to the ceded lands that are

currently being addressed through the political process.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, they relied on 

federal law to create the fiduciary obligation. So if 

we think that federal law did not create the fiduciary 

obligation, what should we do?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Then the Court should vacate 

and remand. But we believe the better interpretation of 

the Hawaii Supreme Court's opinion is that it believed 

that the source of the fiduciary duty at issue was State 

law and not Federal law. To be sure --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All Federal law? 

All Federal law? In other words, not simply the Apology 

Resolution but the other Federal provisions?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: As the source for fiduciary 

duty?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think 

those -- yes.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: The source for the fiduciary 

duty, according to the Hawaii Supreme Court, was State 

law. To the extent that the Hawaii Supreme Court --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Shanmugam, on page 99, 

the State supreme court is saying, inasmuch as the 

Apology Resolution and related State legislation give 

rise to a fiduciary duty. They are saying the Apology 

Resolution did so, too, not only State law.

MR. SHANMUGAM: They did say at various 

points in the opinion that the Apology Resolution, 

together with State law, gave rise to the fiduciary 

duty.

 But I think that if one looks at the 

critical portion of the Hawaii Supreme Court's opinion 

on pages 31A to 32A, where the Hawaii Supreme Court 

actually discusses the relevance of the Apology 

Resolution, the Court makes clear that it is relying on 

it only for the acknowledgment that Native Hawaiians 

have unresolved claims.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how to you explain 

the language, over and over again, I won't repeat it, 

but they said this resolution of ours is dictated by, 

compelled by, the Apology Resolution? Without the 

Apology Resolution it would be an entirely different 

case. And now you seem to be taking what the Hawaii 

Supreme Court put as the necessary link, the Apology 

Resolution, before that this would have been impossible, 

and you are treating it now as sort of window dressing, 

icing on the cake, really didn't matter.

 But we would disrespect the Hawaii Supreme 

Court if we didn't take them at their word and say --

using words such as "dictated," "compelled." You -- you 

are treating this as sort of just part of the

atmosphere.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, it was more than mere 

window dressing, Justice Ginsburg. The apology 

resolution really did confirm the factual predicate for 

Respondent's State law claim. And I do mean to 

emphasize that these have been State law claims from the 

outset. If you take a look at the original complaint in 

this case, which is found in the Joint Appendix at pages 

34a to 36a, the only source of law on which we rely for 

the counts at issue here was article 12, section 4 --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what you relied on 

but it's not what the Hawaii Supreme Court relied on, 

and I would repeat the point I made in the prior 

argument: what's worrisome about this is they are 

fastening on a piece of Federal legislation and said, we 

are compelled to do this because of Federal law. What 

that does is it removes it from the Hawaii political 

process.

 If they left Federal law out of it, and they 

said truly this decision rests on State law, we think 

that the title belongs with the Native Hawaiians, then 

they have to answer to the policy; and here the Hawaii 

Supreme Court insulates themselves by using the Federal 

law as a crutch.

about this, Justice Ginsburg, if the Hawaii Supreme 

Court's opinion is read to construe the Apology 

Resolution as creating some affirmative duty or 

obligation as a matter of Federal law, we agree that 

that would be erroneous. And if the Court --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you agree that there 

would be a Federal question if the Hawaiian Supreme 

Court said the Apology Resolution dictates our results?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: No, because we believe that 

read in context, Justice Kennedy, that that statement is 

consistent with our theory of the Hawaii Supreme Court's 

reliance on the Apology Resolution. So --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why doesn't the Hawaii 

Supreme Court's reliance upon Hawaiian law to establish 

that there is some property right on the part of these 

native Hawaiians -- why doesn't that conflict with 

Federal law?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: The Hawaii Supreme Court 

relied on Hawaii law only for the existence of the 

fiduciary duty and that fiduciary duty has repeatedly 

been recognized by the Hawaii Supreme Court. That duty 

gives Native Hawaiians an equitable or beneficial 

interest in the plan.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't care what you call 

it; it's a property interest.

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: As I read the Federal law, 

it extinguished all property rights in these lands; the 

lands were transferred to the Federal Government; and 

the Federal Government transferred them in absolute fee 

without any encumbrances to the State of Hawaii. Now if 

you are telling me the Hawaii Supreme Court is now 

finding as a matter of State law that there is a 

property interest on the part of the Native Hawaiians --

I don't care what you call it, equitable or whatever --

it seems to me that is flat contradiction of Federal 

law, and probably is an issue that we ought to address 

in this opinion.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: There are two separate 

issues, Justice Scalia. The first is what was the 

source for the injunction in this case. And the source 

of the injunction was Respondent's instant claim for 

breach of fiduciary duty. Now to be sure, we were 

arguing that there would be a breach of the fiduciary 

duty to Native Hawaiians precisely because Native 

Hawaiians have underlying claim to the land. It's those 

underlying claims that trigger all of these additional 

Federal issues that Petitioners are now seeking to 

inject into the case.

purposes of this Court's review at this stage is that in 

the Hawaii Supreme Court, we freely and repeatedly 

conceded that any underlying claims to ceded lands would 

be nonjusticiable. That much was clear as a matter of 

State law.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You concede -- you concede 

that the Apology Resolution does not say that the 

Hawaiian people's claims are valid.

no.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

JUSTICE BREYER: 

The Apology Resolution --

Does it say that? Yes or 

MR. SHANMUGAM: -- does not directly speak 

to the merits of any underlying claims.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so if that's so, do 

you object to a three-sentence pro curiam opinion in 

this case where we say, to the extent that the Hawaiian 

Supreme Court could be read to suggest that the Apology 

Resolution either resolved or cast a cloud, legally 

speaking, on the title of the trust land, or suggested 

in any way that land be enjoined -- the sale be 

enjoined, the Court made a mistake; and insofar as it is 

resting on State law, that's up to them.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: I think we would acquiesce 

in that with one small quibble, which is that I think 

the issue being debated here is not whether the Hawaii 

Supreme Court relied on the Apology Resolution as 

creating some cloud on title. Precisely because we 

conceded below that the underlying claims were 

nonjusticiable, the Hawaii Supreme Court did not opine 

on the merits of those underlying claims. The only 

issue is whether the Hawaii Supreme Court believed that 

the Apology Resolution created a fiduciary obligation to 

essentially preserve and protect the ceded lands, until 

those underlying --

JUSTICE BREYER: How could it have done 

that? I mean, I didn't see anything in here that 

suggests anything like that. That is to suggest that 

the Apology Resolution created an obligation on the part 

of the State courts to enjoin sales until everything was 

worked out. Now I have read this Apology Resolution 

about six times, and I certainly didn't see anything 

like that.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes. And we agree that the 

Apology Resolution could not be read to create some 

affirmative duty not to sell the ceded lands.

disposition of the land.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: It is, after all, 

significant that Congress --

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Congress expressed its 

support for the reconciliation process, Justice Breyer,

legislature for the ultimate resolution of those claims;

Justice Ginsburg's question, and we feel it's important-

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- if you took Federal 

law, the Apology Resolution, out of the picture, the 

Hawaii Supreme Court could reach the result that it 

reached and then we might have questions about its 

consistency with the Admissions Act and the Newlands 

Resolution; but as Justice Breyer said, if we disabuse 

them of the notion that there is any Federal compulsion 

here, then the rest is to be sorted out. We wouldn't 

have to say that they have a claim under State law, just

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the political process 

question I think is really bothersome, that the Hawaii 

Supreme Court chose to use this Federal crutch. It 

seems a very weak reed.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: And it's for that reason, 

Justice Ginsburg, that we freely concede that if the 

Hawaii Supreme Court had relied on the Apology 

Resolution as creating some Federal duty, that would be 

problematic. That would be not --

Newlands Resolution and Admission Act and the Organic 

Law, do you acknowledge that if the Hawaii Supreme Court 

relied on those, that also would be inappropriate?

the same way you say they relied on the Apology 

Resolution, to give rise to a fiduciary responsibility 

under State law.

Federal act could be read as creating a fiduciary duty 

not to sell the ceded lands. So I think I would concede

that that would be problematic as well. But I think 

that the question before the Court according to 

Petitioners is whether an injunction, even if that 

injunction were framed solely in terms of State law, 

might itself contravene the Newlands Resolution by 

virtue of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you would have no 

-- just to carry on the opinion-drafting process, you 

would have no objection to an opinion that said no 

source of Federal law gave rise to a duty under State 

law, fiduciary or otherwise; that any further 

proceedings on remand should be based solely on State 

law?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that that is 

right in the sense that we certainly think that the 

Hawaii Supreme Court in the first place intended to rely 

on a State law of fiduciary duty. And we would 

certainly have no problem with and indeed would welcome 

a remand that afforded the Hawaii Supreme Court an 

opportunity to do what we think they did in the first 

place.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They do nothing at all? 

Could I get back to Justice Breyer's three-sentence pro 

curiam, where we just say to the extent that the Supreme 

Court of Hawaii relied upon the Apology Resolution as

creating any -- any property entitlement in the 

Hawaiians, it was in error. Okay, we send it back to 

the Hawaiian Supreme Court and the Hawaii Supreme Court 

smiles, and doesn't do a blessed thing. Leaves --

leaves the injunction against any distribution of the 

land in effect. What -- what happens then?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I don't think they 

would do that, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: On remand, I think that they 

would consider the issue of whether the injunction could 

be granted on State law, which after ball was the basis 

of our complaint from day one in this case. And there 

is certainly language --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not if we said "to the 

extent that." I mean, if we said it is -- it's grounded 

on the proposition that the Apology Resolution creates 

property rights, and that's wrong; then they have to do 

something.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, presumably --

be grounded on that, we take no position on whether it's 

grounded on that or not --

JUSTICE SCALIA. -- why would that require 

any action on their part?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: If the Court were to write 

that opinion, I assume the last line of the opinion 

would be to vacate and remand, and that would eliminate 

the injunction and so the Hawaii Supreme Court would 

have the case once again; and at that point the Hawaii 

Supreme Court could clarify that the source of fiduciary 

duty at issue was State law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not simply a 

question of the source of the fiduciary duty. It, 

presumably, in the course of saying what the Apology 

Resolution, the Newlands Act, the Organic Act, and the 

Admission Act had to say, we may well say something to 

the effect that, because it conveyed perfect title, it's 

inconsistent with the cloud of that title, under a 

fiduciary obligation created by State law or anything 

else.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: And if the Hawaii Supreme 

Court on remand, Mr. Chief Justice, addressed the merits 

of any underlying legal claims, then the Court could 

review the decision, and at that point it might have a 

sense of, for instance, what those legal claims actually 

are.

that these various Federal resolutions, including the 

Apology Resolution, conveyed title to the State in a 

particular way that precluded the burdening of the 

State's title on the basis of Federal law, then they 

would have to find a basis under State law that was not 

inconsistent with the Federal law's conveying of perfect 

title.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that is presumably 

always true, but, you know, I think for purposes of the 

current posture of the current case, Mr. Chief Justice, 

the only Federal issue that is before the Court is the 

question of whether the Apology Resolution was the 

source of the underlying obligation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And do you think --

MR. SHANMUGAM: Petitioners did not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you think that that 

resolution is distinguishable in any way from the 

apology that the United States made to the people of 

Japanese ancestry who were interned after World War II? 

The United States did say -- it was -- I think it was an 

executive order by President Ford that, in no uncertain 

terms, stated that the United States made a dreadful 

error and there was never reason for rounding these 

people up and putting them in interment camps.

as I understand it, had no substantive effect until 

Congress passed legislation providing for compensation.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: The -- the Apology 

Resolution in this case does not speak directly to the 

merits of any underlying claims. What does do is 

recognize that the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii 

was illegal, apologized for the Federal Government's 

involvement in that overthrow, and, in the operative 

provision of the resolution, expresses support for the 

reconciliation process. And it is that expression of 

support on which the Hawaii Supreme Court critically 

relied here in informing its application of State law.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If I said that -- just in 

the opinion -- and said just what you said, and nothing 

else about the resolution, say we don't see any other 

way in which the resolution could have supported this, 

would that -- is that okay with you?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, that would be okay, 

Justice Breyer, and I do think that it would be 

important for this Court to make clear that to the 

extent that the Hawaii Supreme Court, in any subsequent 

remand, relies on the Apology Resolution only for what 

are essentially factual findings, its acknowledgment 

that Native Hawaiians have unrelinquished claims, which 

is undoubtedly true as a factual matter -- I don't hear

that there is an ongoing reconciliation process, that is 

entirely proper. And the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then it would 

also have to just -- the opinion we're drafting would go 

further, I suppose, and since we are interpreting all 

these Federal provisions, it may not be sufficient to 

say that it did not create this obligation and the 

Hawaiian Supreme Court was wrong to do that, but that it 

precluded the creation under State law of this type of 

obligation.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if the Hawaiian 

Supreme Court wants to create, under State law, a 

particular type of fiduciary obligation grounded on the 

status of the land prior to admission, then it has to 

run -- under the Supremacy Clause, it has to be 

consistent with the Federal provisions.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: But the Hawaii Supreme 

Court, in the opinion under review, did not ground that 

duty on any judgment about the validity of the original 

conveyance of title --

have to determine whether Federal law precluded the

 MR. SHANMUGAM: But I do think, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that that is an entirely discrete 

question from the question presented, and it's entirely 

discrete precisely because this argument concerning the 

Newlands Resolution could have arisen, even if the 

injunction were, as we believe it was, unambiguously 

based solely on State law with nary a reference to the 

Apology Resolution.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Native Hawaiians --

MR. SHANMUGAM: And it is precisely --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Native Hawaiians --

they do get 20 percent of the proceeds, correct?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what -- that comes 

out of Hawaii legislation?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Yes, that's right. It comes 

out of -- I think it's Hawaii statute 10-13.5, and as a 

matter of State law they get 20 percent of the revenue 

from the ceded-lands trust, though the amount of that 

revenue has itself been the subject of protracted and 

unresolved litigation.

figure, is that the subject of litigation?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: The valuation of the 

Leiali'i parcel was challenged in this litigation, and 

it remains pending before the trial court.

 But, I think, more broadly the important 

point is that to the extent that the injunction in this 

case was based on the lack of resolution of underlying 

claims in the State political process, the Hawaii 

legislature could readily resolve those claims without 

in any way casting any doubt on the validity of the 

original conveyance of lands to the Federal Government.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It also, I guess, has a --

there -- in the Admission Resolution, it set up a trust. 

They hold it in trust, and there are five purposes in 

the trust, and only one of those relates to the Native 

Hawaiians. Now, I know from the newspapers -- I don't 

know the merits of it -- but the trust that has been set 

up is the subject of controversy continuously.

 So what I don't see -- and I hope we don't 

have to get into this -- is what the relation between 

the trust principles as enacted in the legislature is 

and the trust principles set forth in the Admissions 

Resolution. Is there any law going to anything like 

that?

something about that, because you think that it is 

relevant to our interpretation of the Hawaii Supreme 

Court's opinion. What State of Hawaii did, with article 

12, section 4 of the Hawaii Constitution, was 

essentially to say that, while the State does have some 

discretion to use the assets in the section 5(f) 

ceded-lands trust for any of the stated purposes, the 

State owes a particularly high duty to Native Hawaiians.

 The Hawaii Supreme Court has so construed 

article 12, section 4, in other cases involving the 

ceded-lands trust. And, at page 39a of its opinion in 

this case, the Hawaii Supreme Court plainly relied on 

that provision as a source of its fiduciary duty, the 

fiduciary duty that we believe was at issue in this 

case. The opinion does not cite that provision in so 

many words, but it refers to the Hawaii Constitution in 

a case construing that provision.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is the court the trustee?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: The State is the trustee.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The State is the trustee. 

So I assume it would be up to the State officers to 

decide to what extent the obligation to the Hawaiians, 

among the five obligations, should be given precedence. 

Is the Supreme Court of Hawaii directing the State 

officers to give it precedence?

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, article 12, section 4, 

we would respectfully submit, Justice Scalia -- it does 

place Native Hawaiians in something of a privileged 

position vis-a-vis the other beneficiaries. And in 

construing article 12, section 4, the Hawaii Supreme 

Court was doing, albeit in a somewhat unusual context, 

what courts do every day, which is essentially to 

evaluate whether the trustee is acting consistent with 

the trustee's obligations under the terms of the trust.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And saying that the trustee 

must direct it primarily to -- to that among the five 

ends.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: All that the Hawaii Supreme 

Court said was, in light of the very realistic prospect 

that lands may be returned to Native Hawaiians as part 

of the reconciliation process that Congress recognized 

in the Apology Resolution, it would constitute a breach 

of fiduciary duty to sell those lands for another trust 

purpose, for the simple reason that once those lands are 

gone, they are gone forever. And that is entirely 

consistent with the general principle of trust law, that 

a trustee in exercising its discretion --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And all this comes from the 

fact that Congress made reference to and approved a 

so-called reconciliation process?

that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So in -- in perpetuam, this 

land can't be transferred because Congress approved the 

this reconciliation process?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Only until the claims of the 

Native Hawaiians are resolved. And what is clear --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I see.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: -- regardless of the degree 

of the reliance on the Apology Resolution, Justice 

Scalia, is that the Hawaii legislature has substantial 

discretion to act and to act in a way that essentially 

vacates the terms of the injunction. So if the Hawaii 

legislature either says, we're going to reach a 

definitive solution of the underlying claims of the 

Native Hawaiians by giving them land or additional 

monetary compensation, or the Hawaii Supreme Court 

determines that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or denying it to them?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Or denying it to them. Then 

presumably, according to the terms of the injunction, it 

would no longer have any force. So the Hawaii 

Legislature remains empowered to act in such a way as to 

get out from under the terms of the injunction to the 

extent they are restrictive.

I would note, however, parenthetically, that 

immediately after this litigation was commenced the 

Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources imposed 

a unilateral moratorium on the sale of ceded lands. 

That moratorium, as an executive matter, has remained in 

effect during the 14-year pendency of this litigation 

even during the considerable period between the trial 

court's ruling in favor of the Petitioners and Hawaii 

Supreme Court's ruling in our favor.

 So there doesn't seem to be any great 

impetus on the part of the State to sell the ceded 

lands. Indeed, Governor Lingle, one of the Petitioners 

in this case, has recently and repeatedly made 

statements to the effect that the State has no intention 

to sell ceded lands.

 And if that is really the State's position 

-- and I would be very interested in my friend's, 

General Bennett's, views on the matter, then it would 

seem that there really is no case or controversy before 

this Court at all. Because if the State has no 

intention to sell ceded lands and the sale of ceded 

lands was the instigating event for this litigation, 

there would not necessarily be any real dispute between 

the parties.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, here the lawsuit was 

commenced by Respondents, because Respondents believed 

that the State was going to imminently sell the Leiali'i 

parcel. That was the triggering event for this 

litigation.

 It now appears at -- at least possible that 

the State has no intention to sell even that parcel. If 

that was true --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think that -- I 

don't think that the State has to have an immediate 

intention to sell any particular piece of land in order 

to object to an injunction against any sale of land by 

the State in the future. I -- I don't think it has to 

wait until it -- it wants to sell a particular plot.

suggests that the -- that there is no longer an 

underlying dispute, Justice Scalia. Because, again --

says that I am free to sell the land, and -- and the

Article III sense precisely because there was a dispute 

between the parties about --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your whole case rests on a 

cloud on the title in favor of your clients. But you --

you ignore the cloud on the title that has been entered 

against the State.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, first of all, our 

whole theory has never been that there is a cloud on the 

title. To be sure, we have maintained at various points 

in this litigation that Native Hawaiians do have 

potentially valid legal claims, as well as moral and 

political claims, to the underlying land.

 But we have never argued that the injunction 

in this case should be based on some assessment of the 

existence or validity of legal claims. To the contrary, 

we have consistently taken the position -- and this is 

clear from our briefs in support of the Hawaii Supreme 

Court -- that any such underlying claims would be 

nonjusticiable.

 And for that reason all we were seeking was 

an injunction to protect these lands until those claims 

could be resolved through the political process. That 

was all we were conceding below, and the Hawaii 

Legislature again could readily resolve those underlying 

claims without in any way casting doubt on the validity

of the Newlands Resolution or any other Federal

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can I --

MR. SHANMUGAM: -- to ceded lands.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can I go back to your --

your suggestion that this is a moot case because the 

government -- because the -- the governor agrees with 

your position. But wasn't a lot of money already sunk 

into developing this area of Maui for desperately needed 

housing?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: A lot of money was sunk into 

this parcel, at least according to the record below. 

And the State would remain free at a minimum to proceed 

with the development by simply entering into long-term 

leases instead of the sale of these parcels of land. 

Indeed, that appears to be some suggestion that that is 

what the State would do in the event that this Court 

does not vacate the injunction.

 And so -- and, indeed, in the State of 

Hawaii it is not uncommon for land to be transferred by 

means of such long-term leases. So it isn't as if the 

State would be barred from engaging in any development 

whatsoever. The terms of the injunction simply prohibit 

the sale of these lands.

operating under an effective moratorium on the sale of 

ceded lands of its own volition during the pendency of 

this litigation, which suggests at a minimum, regardless 

of the jurisdictional implications, that there is no 

great burden on the State from this injunction, which, 

again, by its terms lasts only as long as the State 

legislature acts.

 And I would add one additional point on that 

score, which is that to the extent that we believe that 

the Hawaii Supreme Court's decision rested on a 

fiduciary duty under State law, the State would, of 

course, be free to amend its constitution in order to 

make clear that the State's fiduciary duty to Native 

Hawaiians does not run to the extent of requiring this 

injunction. But this -- there has been no effort to do 

that, and I would submit, as a political matter, it 

would be highly unlikely.

didn't raise in -- in your opposition to the petition

statements about the lack of an intention to sell ceded

even if the Court does not believe that this rises to 

the level of jurisdictional import, that it is at least 

significant in assessing the substantiality of the 

burden on the State. That the State through its highest 

representative appears to be suggesting that the State 

has no present need to alienate any of these lands.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Shanmugam, just 

as a matter of curiosity, do you know what percentage of 

the Hawaiian population is comprised of Native 

Hawaiians?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: I think the most recent 

figures from the 2000 census are that there are 

something like 1.2 million people in the State of 

Hawaii. And of that number something like 240,000 

identify themselves as Native Hawaiians in the way that 

that phrase is currently defined under State law.

 Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

General Bennett, you have a minute remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. MARK J. BENNETT

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. BENNETT: Thank you, Your Honor.

 It is undisputed that Respondents asserted a 

property-interest claim. That any property-interest 

claim is, in fact, inconsistent with Federal law. That 

the State has perfect title to these lands, and that 

there is no possible reason why this Court should not 

disabuse the State court of the incorrect notion that 

the State lacks perfect title.

 On the mootness issue, the ASARCO versus 

Kadish case makes clear that the injunction that has 

been entered is a present injury. But, in addition, the 

governor, who does not control all of the State lands --

there are a variety of independent agencies that do --

talked about sale but not transfer or exchange, which 

are other things that are forbidden by this court's --

the State court's -- injunction. But ASARCO clearly 

sets out that we have an injury.

 But, again, what -- the basis of the State 

court's decision is a property-right interest. It is 

now undisputed by counsel that such a property-right 

interest is absolutely inconsistent with Federal law,

and there is no reason why in this 14-year-old 

litigation this Court should not make clear the simple 

and indisputed fact that, pursuant to the Newlands 

Resolution, the Organic Act and the Admission Act, that 

the State has perfect title.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, general. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:10 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled mattered was submitted.)
