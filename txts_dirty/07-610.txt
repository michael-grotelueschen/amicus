 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 07-610, Locke v. Karass.

 Mr. Young.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. JAMES YOUNG

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. YOUNG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This case addresses whether the First and 

Fourteenth Amendments permit public employers to compel 

nonunion employees to subsidize the union's expressive 

speech of a political nature in a public forum, 

specifically litigation in courts and before 

administrative agencies not involving their bargaining 

unit.

 We submit that the answer to this question 

is no, a result supported by the Court's unanimous, 

unambiguous, and categorical holding in Ellis. In 

Ellis, this Court held that, to avoid constitutional 

problems, nonmembers under the Railway Labor Act could 

not be forced to subsidize any litigation not arising 

within their bargaining unit, not even litigation to 

enforce another bargaining unit's agreement in 

bankruptcy proceedings.

JUSTICE SCALIA: But, of course, they 

wouldn't be subsidizing it if -- if, indeed, it is some 

kind of a -- essentially an insurance scheme. They --

they contribute to the national union, and in exchange 

the national union defends their interest just as it 

defends the interest of other unions. You didn't 

address that -- that pooling argument.

 MR. YOUNG: I would respectfully disagree, 

Justice Scalia, but my answer to your question --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't seem to me fair 

to call it "subsidizing" if, in fact, that's what's 

going on.

 MR. YOUNG: Well, it is also not fair, 

Justice Scalia, to call it "insurance." It's 

affiliation, and the answer to the question --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know because that 

wasn't inquired into by the court below. I guess we 

really -- we really don't know, do we, when -- whether 

the local union can make any demands upon the -- upon 

the national union for -- for litigation defense?

 MR. YOUNG: Well, I think we can rely, 

Justice Scalia, on the admissions contained in MSEA's 

brief, which clearly concedes that, in fact, SEIU has no 

enforceable obligations under its affiliation 

arrangement with MSEA.

 MR. YOUNG: Well, of course, that -- that is 

what they call it, Justice Kennedy. And -- and -- and 

pooling is -- is certainly something that we believe the 

Court rejected in Ellis when it set forth a categorical 

rule.

 The pooling argument was raised in the 

briefs in Ellis, and this Court did not see fit to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Young, I thought that 

in Ellis the litigation -- the Ellis Court said that 

that litigation did not have as its subject matter 

negotiation or administration of a collective bargaining 

contract.

 MR. YOUNG: I don't believe that's the case, 

Justice Ginsburg, because Ellis dealt with enforcing a 

bargaining agreement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm quoting from -- I'm 

quoting from that decision at page 453. The case 

involved litigation "not involving negotiation or 

administration of a collective bargaining contract."

 MR. YOUNG: Well, of course, Justice 

Ginsburg, the -- some of the litigation did involve 

enforcing another bargaining unit's agreement in 

bankruptcy proceedings. I don't know how that is not

enforcing --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, are you saying the 

Court got it wrong? I mean, the words that I'm quoting 

are from the opinion: "Not involving negotiation or 

administration of a collective bargaining contract."

 MR. YOUNG: Well, that -- that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's the only thing 

that could be germane. If it doesn't relate to that, 

then your case is solid.

 MR. YOUNG: Well, I'm trying -- I'm -- I'm 

trying to find the specific language, Justice Ginsburg, 

and I apologize for my inadequacy in this regard. But I 

think the point that we -- I think the point that we 

would rely on in Ellis in -- in -- in the very paragraph 

that you referred to is the specificity with which this 

Court discussed what was chargeable. It referred to the 

contract, for instance. It referred to the exclusive 

representative twice; not an exclusive representative, 

but the exclusive representative. It referred to the 

bargaining unit not less than five times in that single 

paragraph in discussing what was permissible under the 

Railway Labor Act.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you want to stand or fall 

on the all-or-nothing argument that nonmembers can never 

be required to pay for any extra-unit litigation

expenses, or do you have an -- an additional argument?

 MR. YOUNG: Well, no, Justice Alito. We 

believe -- we believe that the -- the Ellis standard is 

the constitutional standard as both principal opinions 

in Lehnert discuss.

 In -- in Lehnert, Justice Blackmun 

specifically recognized it in his -- in his plurality 

opinion; and Justice Scalia himself said there was good 

reason -- good cause to treat Ellis as stating the 

constitutional rule.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you take -- do you 

take that as -- as -- as meaning that the union couldn't 

buy litigation insurance?

 MR. YOUNG: Real insurance, Justice Souter? 

I think that -- obviously that would be a --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Some of those -- some of 

those premiums are going to subsidize the defense in --

in -- in cases beyond this bargaining unit. In fact, 

most of it will.

 MR. YOUNG: Well -- but the distinction, 

Justice Souter, I think is discussed in the brief, 

amicus brief, filed by Pacific Legal Foundation. For 

one thing, it would not be the labor union that would be 

-- another labor union receiving those insurance funds. 

It would be a third-party insurer, presumably. That

would be --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So -- so in your view, 

then, even if the agreement with the -- with the parent 

union in this case involved an explicit obligation on 

the part of the parent to come in and defend in -- if 

litigation arose in this unit, that would still be bad?

 MR. YOUNG: It would add the -- the insult 

of the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I'm not interested in 

insults. Is it -- is it constitutional, or isn't it?

 MR. YOUNG: We believe it would not be if 

the international affiliate were the insurer, Justice 

Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then -- and -- and -- and 

you do take the position that a -- a genuine insurance 

policy issued by an insurer would not violate the 

constitutional standard?

 MR. YOUNG: That -- that is the -- that is 

our argument, Justice Souter.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though -- even 

though there may be a great disconnect between the 

premiums and the needs of the particular unit? I mean, 

let's say the particular unit has -- I don't know -- has 

always had a history of good relations with the 

employer. It has never had to call upon litigation in

20 years, and they don't anticipate it, and yet their 

insurance premiums rise dramatically because of very 

hostile and extended litigation by another unit. Do you 

-- do you concede that case?

 MR. YOUNG: I -- I don't think -- well, I 

don't think I would concede the premise of your 

question, Mr. Chief Justice. The -- and I think that 

point is -- is discussed fairly thoroughly in Pacific 

Legal Foundation's brief.

 A rate setting in an insurance context is --

is radically different than the affiliations fee setting 

in this context. Rate -- and -- and much more about 

insurance than, frankly, I know; but it -- it certainly 

is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it's based on the 

experience of the whole -- the whole cohort of insureds.

 MR. YOUNG: It's also --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the Chief Justice's 

question says: Can a -- can a -- a local that is 

certainly on the basis of past experience not going to 

need this insurance nearly as much as other locals --

can it enter into an insurance arrangement with other 

locals to buy the insurance for all of the locals even 

though it knows that it won't benefit very much from 

that insurance policy?

 MR. YOUNG: And I'm sorry, Chief Justice 

Roberts.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You should have said, yes, 

Chief Justice.

the help, Mr. Chief Justice, and your pointing that out, 

Justice Scalia. My -- I -- I misunderstood the 

question, and I apologize.

 Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. The -- the -- our 

point would be, however, that in that type of 

relationship and I -- as I said, that's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that mean that each 

time they buy an insurance policy they have to 

investigate which locals are going to get the most 

benefit out of it?

 MR. YOUNG: Well, I don't think that's a --

that's a decision for the locals. That's the insurer 

setting rates, and -- and I -- I don't know of a market, 

quite honestly, Justice Stevens, for that type of 

insurance.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you give one answer

to the Chief Justice on the facts he gave and a 

different one if the record showed that everybody got a 

proportional benefit out of the group policy?

 MR. YOUNG: I don't -- no, Justice Stevens. 

I don't think my question -- my answer would differ.  I 

think, however --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So your answer doesn't 

depend, then, on the facts that he included in that 

question?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He is not trying to 

help you.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure he was, 

either.

 MR. YOUNG: Well, one looks for it where one 

can find it, Justice Stevens and Mr. Chief Justice.

 The differing -- I think that the 

distinction has to be made here between insurance on the 

one hand and affiliation. There -- in -- in the 

insurance context you have --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that mean all 

insurance policies are bad?

 MR. YOUNG: No, no, no. I -- I -- I concede 

insurance, Justice Stevens. I -- my point -- if it is 

true insurance, insurance where there is mutuality of

obligation.

 The difficulty that this Court, I believe, 

found in the Ellis case when it set a bright-line test 

was that it was public -- and I -- and I think can be 

discerned from the Court's other cases, including 

Glickman -- is we're talking about public speech, speech 

of a political nature in a public forum.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there was -- there 

was mutuality of obligation in the hypothesis that I 

gave you in which the agreement with the parent union 

required an affirmative obligation of the parent union 

to come in and defend if litigation arose. And you said 

that still would not be constitutional.

 MR. YOUNG: And I -- and I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So the -- so the criterion 

has got to be something other than mutuality of 

obligation, right?

 MR. YOUNG: And it assuredly is, Justice 

Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And what is the other 

distinction?

 MR. YOUNG: The other distinction has to be 

that it is not -- it is -- the problem also arises from 

the nature of the forced relationship. As this Court 

has recognized in cases such as Ellis and Abood,

allowing the agency shop at all works an infringement on 

First Amendment rights.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: We -- we -- we start with 

that premise, but what is the other distinction, then? 

If it is not mutuality of obligation, what -- what is 

the -- what is the -- the -- the -- the point that 

separates the -- the sheep from the goats here?

 MR. YOUNG: Well, the mutuality of 

obligation coupled with true rate setting in the sense 

that there is a -- there is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what is -- what has 

rate setting got to do with -- with your basic point? 

Your basic point, as I understand it, is that some of 

the money that's being taken from the -- from the local 

union and in our example subsidized by the service fee 

is being used to subsidize litigation for other unions. 

And that is, it seems to me, exactly true in the 

insurance case.

 Some of those premiums will subsidize 

litigation -- speech -- involving speech in -- in other 

union bargaining areas. What's the distinction?

 MR. YOUNG: Well, the distinction, Justice 

Souter, would be that there is -- it doesn't seem to me 

that there is a -- there is a larger pool created than 

just a union litigation pool in the insurance context.

Furthermore, the -- the -- the money, in fact, is spread 

about --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't know whether that's 

true or not. If you buy labor litigation insurance I 

suppose it is not. Don't they set their rates with 

respect to the experience in labor litigation, not in --

on their experience with automobile accidents.

 MR. YOUNG: I don't know of an insurance 

company that's quite that specific, Justice Souter, nor 

have I ever heard of labor -- labor union insurance --

labor litigation insurance. So I'm not sure that such a 

market actually exists.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Neither do I.

 MR. YOUNG: Certainly there is not on this 

record that would suggest so, sir.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I did want to understand 

your position. Suppose there is a statewide contract 

for public employees and one union brings a suit to 

interpret a provision of that collective bargaining 

agreement having to do with overtime or holidays or 

something. And then it notifies the other union, we're 

going to have to drop this litigation because we can't 

afford it. Even though it ultimately may affect you 

down the line, you're not a party. I don't see the harm 

in allowing the other union to subsidize or

contribute -- use whatever verb you want -- that 

litigation -- that litigation.

 MR. YOUNG: Well, of course if the other 

union --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what -- what harm 

are we trying to prevent here?

 MR. YOUNG: Well, obviously First Amendment 

harm, Justice Kennedy. But I think understanding -- if 

I understand your hypothetical --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The First Amendment can 

be -- can be a sword or a shield. This union wants to 

use it as a sword in order to promote, in order to 

protect its rights under the collective bargaining 

agreement. I don't see the harm.

 MR. YOUNG: Excuse me, Justice Kennedy. I'm 

sorry for interrupting you.

 Certainly the union has the right to 

associate as it sees fit. The First Amendment protects 

that right. We are not suggesting that it doesn't have 

the right to go out and ask other labor unions to 

contribute to its litigation activities.

 What the First Amendment -- the -- the First 

Amendment right to not speak is -- is involved when, in 

the words of the Ninth Circuit in one of these cases, 

"they seek to mulch from the unwilling moneys for their

speech activities in a public forum."

 JUSTICE BREYER: What I don't understand 

about --

MR. YOUNG: I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Finish because there's 

something --

MR. YOUNG: Thank you, sir. And my point 

would be under the hypothetical as I understand it, you 

posed a union in -- within the State under the same 

bargaining agreement being asked to support for 

litigation under one of the other locals. I can think 

of a number of cases where that's actually the case, two 

locals under one bargaining agreement just in my own 

experience. And so you're not suggesting something 

that's unusual.

 I think under that circumstances that would 

fall squarely within Ellis' rule. It involves the 

bargaining agreement. It may not involve the specific 

bargaining unit, but it is concerning the bargaining 

agreement.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's not quite the 

hypothetical. Let's say there are two bargaining 

agreements but they're identical, and that this 

litigation that's underway will have persuasive force 

for the union that's thinking about entering, and then

the union decides that it is going to enter to help the 

union involved in the suit, and the members of the, of 

the contributing union object and you say they have a 

First Amendment right. That's your point?

 MR. YOUNG: Yes, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't see why the 

objects of collective bargaining the, objects of 

union -- of the union, are not being fulfilled.

 MR. YOUNG: Because that goes beyond the 

free rider rationale which justifies the agency shop in 

the earlier cases such as Hansen and Street. The free 

rider that the Congress was concerned with -- and of 

course, it's been adopted through Abood to apply to the 

States -- the free rider that Congress was concerned 

with is the free rider that is required to accept the 

union's services and refuses to subsidize those 

services. And the -- this Court in discussing that in 

terms of lobbying and public relations activities found 

that the relationship was too attenuated.

 Obviously judicial decisionmaking and 

administrative decisionmaking is good for its persuasive 

effect in many different contexts. But that -- that 

relationship was found to be too attenuated in Ellis and 

with regard to litigation and certainly in Lehnert with 

regard to public relations --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's the part I don't 

understand. It's not your fault. I don't understand it 

in the cases either. What First Amendment right are we 

talking about? There is an individual who, under the 

agency shop, pays dues to a union. Now, suppose the 

union uses some of that money in a way that has nothing 

to do with politics, nothing to do with speech, but it 

doesn't happen to benefit that particular member.

 For example, you can have a central union 

headquarters 4,000 miles away where there's a librarian 

who's doing research on a matter that will help lots of 

people, but nobody in this area. Or you could have a 

program to commemorate the people who were hurt in the 

State of Hawaii at a union uprising or strike of some 

kind where nobody in this particular area is ever going 

to go.

 Now, both of those activities are totally 

legitimate union activities that have nothing to do with 

politics. But this particular place won't benefit from 

them. Okay, what in the First Amendment prohibits the 

union from paying for such an activity out of general 

union dues assessed on everybody? And why would the 

First Amendment prohibit such a thing?

 MR. YOUNG: Under Lehnert, Justice Breyer, 

the expenditures which you posit would be chargeable and

are not at issue here. `

 JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. If they are 

chargeable because they have nothing to do with 

politics, perfectly legitimate, why isn't it also 

chargeable to pay for the costs of a lawsuit which has 

nothing to do with politics, totally for a union 

purpose, it just doesn't happen to benefit that person 

who's miles away in a different local?

 MR. YOUNG: Because benefit has never been 

the touchstone. And under Ellis and under Lehnert and 

certain pluralities --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't want you to tell me 

about cases. I'm abstracting from -- I want to know the 

reasoning. I want to know why.

 MR. YOUNG: Because we are talking about 

public -- political speech of a public nature.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I said there is no politics 

in any of these expenditures. 42 bishops would swear 

there is nothing here that has anything to do with 

politics.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why does it have to be 

political speech? Isn't it enough that it is simply 

speech that certain people don't want to subsidize, or 

speech, so that the commemoration in Hawaii may be 

something that 99.999 percent of the population would

find very commendable, but someone is being forced to 

pay for that?

 MR. YOUNG: And I may --

JUSTICE BREYER: But that's the reasoning 

that you seem to accept and I guess all human activity 

is banned. Because to my knowledge, all human activity 

takes place through speech with a few exceptions that 

are not here relevant.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it isn't banned. 

It's just -- just -- you know, you don't force the 

nonunion member who indeed may be anti-union to pay for 

it. And he doesn't want to subsidize the union 

librarian. He doesn't like unions here. He doesn't 

like unions in Hawaii. And for the government to force 

him to -- to support the union is, I thought, part of 

the reasoning behind --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'd be interested in your 

comments on this dialogue.

 MR. YOUNG: I'd be happy to jump in here 

somewhere, Justice Stevens. I appreciate the colloquy. 

And I think the distinction -- getting back to the point 

Justice Alito raised, and the sharp distinction that has 

been made in the compelled speech and compelled dues 

cases is between the activities -- certainly in the 

compelled union dues cases, is activities for which

nonmembers are compelled to accept the union as 

bargaining representative.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why isn't 

litigation -- what I don't understand is how you draw a 

line between the -- the negotiation of an agreement, 

where Lehnert said this kind of pooling is okay, and the 

enforcement of the agreement. I mean, we're not talking 

about litigation unrelated to collective bargaining. It 

is only litigation that deals with the meaning of a term 

in the contract, whether what the employer has done was 

an unfair labor practice, whether there has been a 

contractual violation.

 MR. YOUNG: For the -- I'm sorry, Justice 

Ginsburg. For the agreement, for the unit, we concede 

that the union may charge for that public speech of a 

political nature in a public forum. We have no dispute 

over charging for enforcing or -- or -- enforcing the 

collective bargaining agreement. That is not our 

dispute.

 The dispute here is only over expenditures 

on behalf of other bargaining units, where we believe 

Ellis said it was too attenuated, but because it is 

not -- my point would be that the litigation which is 

acceptably chargeable -- I think the presumptive -- I 

think the default value in this Court's decisionmaking

on litigation is that it's nonchargeable. However, the 

Court has drawn a narrow exception for that public 

speech in public forum which is related to the union's 

duties as, not related to but in performance of the 

union's duties as bargaining agent the duties for which 

law imposes the union as a bargaining agent.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't understand why 

enforcing, one thing is making the agreement and there 

you agree as you must because of our Lehnert decision 

you can't have these pooling arrangements. What's the 

difference between negotiating an agreement and 

litigation to enforce it.

 MR. YOUNG: I think that would go back as 

far as Justice Marshall and Marbury. It would be an 

empty right if the union were able to negotiate an 

agreement it wouldn't be permitted to enforce. Begins 

begins that's, that's my point. I can't see the 

difference between saying pooling is okay when we're 

dealing with negotiating an agreement, but it's not okay 

when we're dealing with enforcing it.

 The distinction is, Justice Ginsburg, that 

the negotiation of the agreement does not occur in a 

public forum, whereas litigation does, and that's the 

distinction we would draw.

distinction you were drawing was whether or not the 

collective bargaining agreement applies to the 

particular union. If it's a different unit with a 

different agreement I thought you were saying that that 

can't be charged, but if it's the bargaining agreement 

that binds the particular unit, I thought you said that 

was chargeable.

 MR. YOUNG: Mr. Chief Justice, I'm sorry if 

I was confusing.  I thought I was very specific. It is 

chargeable for litigation involving the bargaining 

agreement. We don't dispute that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of the particular 

unit.

 MR. YOUNG: Of the particular unit. That is 

not in dispute here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And I suppose you 

would also concede that if the bargaining agreement is 

exactly the same, you know a number of units have 

exactly the same bargaining agreement, which I would 

suppose is a not uncommon situation, but litigation with 

respect to the terms of the bargaining agreement even 

though it happens to involve a different unit is also 

chargeable to the particular unit.

 MR. YOUNG: No, Mr. Chief Justice, we would 

not concede that. We believe that this Court in Ellis

drew a bright line, and I think that's clear in Ellis' 

discussion of the mutual aid pact which was not 

chargeable in Ellis, found not chargeable in Ellis. The 

distinction that I think this Court has drawn or that 

should I would respectfully suggest should be drawn is 

that -- is a narrow one. It's consistent with strict 

scrutiny and this Court's jurisprudence in that area. 

Only for speech which is narrowly related to the union's 

duties as bargaining agent and performance of those 

duties can public speech -- can charging nonmembers for 

public political speech in a public forum be justified.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Does that mean, because I 

want to be sure -- you exclude the librarian example of 

Justice Breyer?

 MR. YOUNG: The librarian I think would fall 

under the general Lehnert test.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So which side? You have 

to be clear with me.

 MR. YOUNG: There were a lot of sides there, 

Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand you to be 

saying they could not charge the nonmember for the 

expenses of the Hawaiian librarian.

commemoration that Justice Breyer referred to that I

think I had to rethink, because it was a public speech 

in a public forum. The librarian researching bargaining 

issues at the union headquarters in downtown Washington 

or -- well, in downtown Washington of the international 

affiliate I think is chargeable under Lehnert.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The librarian in Hawaii 

researching something that the plaintiff has no interest 

in spending money on, would that be prohibited.

 MR. YOUNG: Well, here, Justice Stevens, we 

are simply talking about of course the international 

affiliate. As far as cross-unit affiliation, I'm not 

sure. I think that would fall under again, general, 

Lehnert's general test.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you tell us two 

hypotheticals. One is the librarian, two is the public 

celebration. Would nonunion, would participating unions 

be allowed to contribute to either of those activities?

 MR. YOUNG: Well, of course they'd be 

allowed to. Can they force nonmembers --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Against nonmembers? 

Against members, there has to be a pro-ration, they has 

to be a pro-ration. A with the librarian, B with the 

celebration.

 MR. YOUNG: The public celebration, no; the 

librarian, I believe so, yes.

JUSTICE SOUTER: You have several times 

mentioned the public forum as having a significance in 

drawing the line and I'm not sure I follow you there. 

Why did you say that?

 MR. YOUNG: Well, I think -- well, Justice 

Souter, that arises from the Court's determinations on 

things like public relations and lobbying and the 

distinction it makes, the distinction for instance in 

Lehnert between the teacher's voice articles and the 

reserve public education program. The distinction drawn 

from that, the different, differing results is that 

where internal union communications regarding 

nonpolitical matters were treated as chargeable by a 

majority of this Court and where the, outward looking 

speech activities is treated as not chargeable.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you this. If an 

employer and a union local decided that you know they 

would really let the sunshine in and they would conduct 

their collective bargaining in a theater with 

microphones and anybody could drop in and hear, would 

that change the chargibility of, as against the 

dissenting nonmembers.

speech would still be directed at the public employer

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMIAH A. COLLINS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. COLLINS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 When this Court in Abood described the kinds 

of expenditures that bargaining agents are are required 

to engage in and that necessitate a rule that requires 

all represented employees including objecting nonmembers 

to pay their share services of lawyers is what the court 

first mentioned. The single narrow question presented 

in this case is whether a local bargaining agent that's 

confronted with the need to pay for those services of 

lawyers to draw upon legal expertise in bargaining 

related matters is required to go it alone rely solely 

on its open resources and its own expertise or --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's not what 

we are talking about. It doesn't have to go it alone. 

It simply can't force members of another unit that can 

decide they are happy to support it but the members who 

don't want to support it who don't like unions, they 

can't be forced to pay for it if it does not relate to 

their collective bargaining agreement.

MR. COLLINS: But the question Mr. Chief 

just sis whether that, I should add if that unit wants 

to not neither go it alone nor give a free ride to 

objecting nonmembers can they avail itself.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the litigation is 

not germane to the unit where people object to that 

unit's collective bargaining agreement they are not free 

riding on anything.

 MR. COLLINS: They are free riding on the 

same thing that Lehnert says they cannot free ride on. 

Lehnert as Mr. Young acknowledges certainly holds that 

as a general proposition when a local union bargaining 

agent is determining how to finance germane expenditures 

that it will incur germane to its unit, it can either 

obviously go it alone rely on its own resources or it 

can enter into an affiliation relationship where it will 

pay an affiliation fee the -- of which will be measured 

by the tote chargeable expenditures incurred by the 

National Union in other bargaining units as well as when 

it's the local's own unit. What Lehnert teaches is that 

that situation cannot fairly be described as requiring 

the objective nonmember to subsidize other units.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if there is no 

-- I guess I'm getting into the solace thor general's 

position here. What if the unit with the objective

members does not have a right to call upon the pool? 

Either, or has never called upon the pool in its 

unlikely that it will. Isn't there, it's not simply 

subsidization. It's their compelled fees being used for 

something that doesn't Ben fate their collective 

bargaining arrangement.

 MR. COLLINS: There are three problems with 

that contention by the solace the -- general which the 

petitioners have adopted for the first time in their 

reply brief. The first problem was precisely that. It 

was not raised in the Court of Appeals, it's not raised 

in the petition for certiorari. The second problem is I 

should add it's not been raised in any other post 

Lehnert case and I think the reason this issue is not 

being raised is it's understood I think incorrectly that 

Lehnert itself did not solve a situation where the kind 

of showing that the solicitor general and now with the 

Petitioners would require. In Lehnert where this court 

did approve pooling of a wide range of expenses the 

court simply referred to the fact that the union in that 

case had a unified membership structure which as the 

court put it under which so many unions operate and the 

court talked about the essence of an affiliation 

relationship between that locals can draw on 

international for services but there was no record, this

was no showing, this was no finding, there was no 

discussion of any notion that that local union in 

Lehnert had an enforceable right for any --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Exactly -- I'm 

sorry. I was just going to say exactly so I regard that 

issue as still open. It was not addressed at all in 

Lehnert.

 MR. COLLINS: It was raised in the reply 

brief in Lehnert. The Petitioners in Lehnert complained 

that a problem with pooling is that there are no 

guarantees and no standards. That -- that's why there's 

a discussion that's reflected in Justice Scalia's 

separate opinion, a discussion of the fact that it was 

acknowledged that there is no contractual relationship, 

but that there were certain customs and -- and 

practices. But there was no evidence and certainly no 

determination by this Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what did the Court 

mean in Lehnert when it said there must be some 

indication the payment is for service that may 

ultimately inure to the benefit of members of the local 

union by virtue of their membership in the parent 

organization?

 MR. COLLINS: What -- what the Court meant 

by that, I believe, Justice Ginsburg, is that -- well,

look at the examples the Court gave of what does not --

or the Court referred to certain kinds of payments a 

local union could make which are not part of an 

affiliation fee payment.

 The Court talks about direct payments to 

other locals. The Court -- the other example given was 

a payment to a -- a national union that wasn't required 

by affiliation but was like a charitable contribution.

 What the Court did not dispute in Lehnert is 

that, to the extent that an affiliation fee is providing 

a pool of resources used by the national union for 

otherwise chargeable services, the potential 

availability of those services does satisfy the 

inurement requirement.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose, let's say, that one 

or more locals someplace else in the country are 

involved in very, very expensive litigation; and, as a 

result, the international assesses all of the locals a 

fee to pay -- to pay for that litigation but at the same 

time adopts a position that it is extremely unlikely in 

the future that the international will ever subsidize 

any other local union litigation expenses.

 Would the local -- would a -- would a local 

union not involved in that litigation -- would they --

would it be permissible for them to charge their

nonmembers?

 MR. COLLINS: If it were a special 

assessment for a specific purpose, I think under -- it 

is not embraced by Lehnert's rationale. It might not 

well not be chargeable, because what Lehnert -- Lehnert 

does not arise in a vacuum. Lehnert talks about the 

typical affiliation fee relationship. And there have 

been various submissions, treatise articles about that.

 So the notion is that a National Union 

charges an affiliation fee for all of the various 

services it provides, and local unions can draw upon 

those resources as needed. If you then talk about a 

special assessment --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if you concede that, 

then aren't you conceding there has to be some standard 

by -- under which to assess whether the local union that 

is being required to pay the fee for extra-unit 

litigation expenses is getting something back in return?

 MR. COLLINS: I think not, Your Honor, for 

-- for two reasons. First, I do think that Lehnert did 

approve --

JUSTICE ALITO: It's not necessary for there 

to be any standard under which to assess that they are 

getting anything back in return? If it's clear they are 

not getting anything back in return, it's still okay?

MR. COLLINS: Not beyond -- and again the 

question isn't presented, but not beyond what Lehnert 

found necessary. Lehnert found it important -- and I 

would say necessary to its decision -- that the union in 

that case had what Lehnert described as a typical, 

unified, membership-affiliation-fee arrangement; and it 

talks about a typical affiliation fee where locals pay 

money to go to the pools of otherwise chargeable 

expenditures of the national union.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you have a 

situation where there is a provision in the collective 

bargaining agreement that the union thinks requires the 

employer to provide air conditioning in the plant, the 

local up in Nome, Alaska has to support that extra --

extra-unit litigation even though it will never have any 

benefit for it?

 MR. COLLINS: Just as Lehnert plainly holds 

that local would have to support the negotiation of that 

provision in the first place in Nome, Alaska. That's 

the holding of Lehnert. The question is whether 

litigation is different, and there is no way that 

litigation is different in any principled way as relates 

to the ruling.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought it meant

to support that type of extra-unit litigation. I mean, 

I --

MR. COLLINS: Well, I may have misconstrued 

your -- it was litigation over --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. Yes, there is 

a provision that is ambiguous, which frequently happens, 

and the union says that requires air conditioning, and 

the company says no, and there is a big fight about 

that.

 MR. COLLINS: Well, I think my answer is 

still correct, Your Honor. Lehnert does not hold --

well, it does not provide the answer as to litigation; 

but Lehnert says if the union in the first instance says 

we want to go to Nome, Alaska and negotiate something 

about air conditioning, that that, even though it only 

affects the unit in Nome, Alaska, becomes part of the 

pool of chargeable expenditures that all units can be 

part of.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure, because 

that negotiation is germane to the Nome, Alaska 

collective bargaining agreement, if they are negotiating 

it there for that unit.

 MR. COLLINS: But the litigation is equally 

germane. Petitioners do not dispute that litigation can 

be germane and chargeable within a particular unit.

They acknowledge that; there is no dispute about that. 

So both the negotiation of the air conditioning right in 

Nome, Alaska and the enforcement of that negotiated 

agreement through litigation are equally germane within 

the unit; the same interests are involved --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But aren't they, aren't 

they equal chargeable? Isn't the unspoken premise of 

your argument and what Lehnert is getting at -- they are 

not only germane, but isn't there an unspoken premise 

that just as the union will support -- the union of the 

dissident objectors in negotiating a collective 

bargaining agreement, the union will also presumably 

support them if litigation is necessary later on to 

enforce it?

 So that the so-called standard by which the 

union's obligation to support the litigation and the 

unit that includes the dissidents is not somehow 

precisely spelled out. The assumption is that they do 

have some obligation to support the litigation if it 

comes to the dissidents' unit. And isn't that -- isn't 

that the point of your argument?

 MR. COLLINS: That's correct, Your Honor, 

and I want to make clear when the Court spoke in Lehnert 

of the essence of an affiliation agreement, an 

affiliation agreement is a contractual relationship. We

would certainly view that as creating a covenant of good 

faith and fair dealing that the national union will deal 

fairly with its various units.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Which is a covenant, in 

effect, of support.

 MR. COLLINS: That's correct, and it's 

actually quite analogous in that regard to the duty of 

fair representation that, let's say an unaffiliated 

local union owns to its objecting nonmembers. The --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think as a 

covenant of support you have -- however many -- about a 

thousand individual units. You think each of those, you 

have a covenant to support them when they all get -- get 

involved in separate litigation? You can't possibly.

 MR. COLLINS: No, Mr. Chief Justice, what I 

said was a covenant of good faith and fair dealing. And 

that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's quite 

unlike, for example, insurance. If you have insurance 

and you as the unit have a particular obligation, you 

have a right to have that covered. There is no similar 

right here.

 MR. COLLINS: That's -- that's correct, Your 

Honor. The First Amendment does not create a rate 

setting rule for unions. And the reason for that is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, so there is no, there 

is no covenant of support. There is what? A covenant 

of support if the litigation in the local unit that 

includes the dissidents has wide significance, and 

therefore could affect other units? Is that what the --

is that what the obligation is?

 MR. COLLINS: No, Justice Souter. I would 

not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is this any obligation at 

all? You said okay, there is an obligation of some kind 

of fair dealing. Given the question that we've got,

some point to support for litigation, right?

 MR. COLLINS: That the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Right?

 MR. COLLINS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. COLLINS: That the National Union --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And how do we articulate 

what that obligation is? If it's not covenant to 

support regardless of what the litigation is, how do we 

articulate what the degree of the obligation of support 

is?

 MR. COLLINS: The way I would articulated 

it, and then I would like to take a step backward and

compare it to the nonaffiliated situation. I would 

articulate it as follows, that there is no any First 

Amendment requirement, that there is in reality in the 

affiliation agreement simply a covenant of good faith 

and good dealing that one local will be treated with 

respect to litigation needs as others would be treated.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the trouble with 

saying that is exactly the point that the Chief Justice 

raised. You don't take the position that no matter what 

the litigation is, the parent union has got to support 

it. Therefore, how do we identify the litigation that 

they will support? How do we know that they have any 

obligation at all?

 MR. COLLINS: They -- they don't have a 

First Amendment obligation, but, Your Honor, that is 

true in the case of agency fees all together. We have 

to take a step back and remember that we are trying to 

perform an exercise the court has said can't be done to 

perfection of trying to distinguish between making 

individuals who object support collective bargaining 

activities not support other things.

 In Hudson itself, in the basic situation --

let's assume there is no affiliation agreement, simply a 

local union, a fee is charged based on the percentage of 

expenses in the prior year that went for chargeable

activities, including, let's say, litigation. That 

creates no guarantee that when the year -- in the year 

that we are now in, when fees are being paid, that if 

litigation is demanded, requested by a nonmember or 

anyone else, that that local union will provide --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it doesn't create a 

guarantee expressed like the terms of an insurance 

policy, but there is, in fact, a local practice to which 

one can refer. And it seems, it would seem reasonable 

in a case like that to say, okay, you can force the 

dissident to pay a fair share on the expectation that 

the same kind of enforcement litigation will take place 

if there is a dispute this year or next year.

 We don't have, as I understand it, a clear 

sort of expectation standard when we are talking about 

affiliation agreements that involve a parent and many, 

many other locals. And the point here, it seems to me, 

is to determine whether there is any obligation at all 

whether the dissident is getting anything or can expect 

to get anything for the fee. And what I want to know is 

how do we describe that obligation?

 MR. COLLINS: I think, at most, the 

obligation is parallel to the duty of fair 

representation in the sense that the entity that's 

responsible for determining what services are going to

be provided to the employees has to treat, in the case 

of the local union members and nonmembers in the unity 

plea, in the case of the national union it's a different 

affiliated entity fairly -- the reason --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we are talking 

about an infringement on the objecting members' first 

amendment rights, and your answer is trust us, we'll 

treat you fairly? I understand that it's a different 

answer if you say you've got a right. We can impose the 

contribution requirement on you, even though you object 

to it because under this agreement, you have a right to 

call upon our services. That's a different case. But 

if your answer is simply trust us we'll treat you 

fairly, that's not the usual standard we apply to 

infringements of First Amendment rights.

 MR. COLLINS: But I have two answers to 

that, Mr. Chief Justice. First, it is essentially the 

answer that's supplied under Hudson, where the court 

says simply use the prior year's percentages. We don't 

know whether this year we'll have the same percentage 

breakdown. We also don't know whether this year the 

union will have enough money to provide any particular 

service or not. But we don't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's different. 

That's a little bit more stringent than saying trust us.

That's saying let's look at the last year and we'll 

figure it out.

 MR. COLLINS: But we look at the -- but --

but we look at the national union typical affiliation 

type arrangement, as the court described it in Lehnert, 

and what we understand is this is a union that's not 

making a profit, it's not piling up fees and putting 

them somewhere. It exists to provide services to local 

affiliates.

 Those affiliates, if they are not provided 

with services, it's not just the nonmember, the objector 

who's being harmed, the members want those services by 

definition.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But couldn't it be, 

couldn't the national say, local, you have asked for 

assistance with such-and-such litigation. We think your 

case is what this Court sometimes calls a bad vehicle. 

We don't want to finance your litigation, the issue is 

important and we are going to wait for a case that 

presents it in a better light, is more likely to win.

 MR. COLLINS: Absolutely, Your Honor, that's 

one thing a national union can properly do. Another 

thing a national union can properly do is to say we've 

just had an unexpected economic crisis, all of a sudden 

midterm we have to change our priorities and we are

going to have to protect people from a lot of layoffs.

 But the second point I want to make --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The issue is not whether 

that's a fair thing for the national union to do. The 

issue is whether the person who is being compelled 

against his will to pay dues to the union is getting 

anything back for that compelled payment. And even 

though the national union may be acting in an entirely 

fair fashion, given its national objectives, the -- the 

compelled payment is not doing what our cases seem to 

say it must do. It has to be paying for services 

rendered.

 MR. COLLINS: What -- the value the -- the 

objector is getting is not have a guarantee of services. 

He has the potential for services far beyond what could 

ever be paid for out of the local's own affiliation 

fees.

 And I would add if a national union were to 

act in some improper way in terms of how it doles out 

assistance -- and by the way, one doesn't see cases on 

this, it's really not in the nature of how national 

unions operate, because again, we are talking about 

members and nonmembers equally in terms of who's going 

to get benefits. So it's not a problem in the real 

world of national unions treating a particular local

unfairly for some reason and not giving them services 

that are given to others. There are certainly a lot of 

judgments involved, as Justice Ginsburg's question 

elicited.

 But if a national union were to treat 

affiliates unfairly, it's quite possible that if and 

when that occurred, that it might have implications 

under a number of possible causes of actions and 

including possibly the right to object. Justice 

Scalia's opinion in Lehnert noted that if and when 

services aren't provided, there might be ground for 

objection.

 The question here is is this a basis under 

the First Amendment to have a prophylactic rule that 

says we are so concerned that even though we have no 

rule under Hudson that provides assurance that an 

unaffiliated local union will provide any particular 

services to its members and nonmembers, we have such a 

concern that somehow national unions won't deliver the 

goods, that we are going to set up the hierarchy of 

either guarantees, standards, which if the issue had 

been presented here and we had created a record, we 

would show the Court -- I think no union in this country 

has and for good reason, both because of the virtual 

infinitude of legitimate factors one could consider also

because of the constant changes in needs of local 

unions --

JUSTICE ALITO: If certain -- if certain 

fees are are being assessed on the theory that this is a 

pooling arrangement, I don't understand why you're 

resisting any effort to impose any standards or any 

inquiry as to whether it's really a pooling arrangement?

 MR. COLLINS: Because, Your Honor -- and the 

reason I started my argument by saying there is really 

two choices, a local union goes it alone or has the 

arrangement that we have here, is that it simply would 

not be possible in the nature of things to have a set of 

standards and guarantees that would be meaningful in any 

way to govern how national unions provide services to 

locals. A standard of basic fairness and equal 

treatment is one thing, but to try to say -- and one 

could tick off, I suppose, 50 things we'll consider.

 We'll consider whether it's going to be an 

important precedent, whether it's the kind of thing a 

local can't afford on its own, whether it's important 

now that we have pressing economic problems and everyone 

is being laid off, is this a good test case or a bad 

test case, how broad will the implications of this be. 

One could list 50 factors, but they wouldn't guide any 

inquiry in a meaningful way.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if we determine 

as a matter of First Amendment law that such a 

requirement is necessary, then you lose, because you're 

saying we can't possibly fashion the test?

 MR. COLLINS: Then we lose and so does the 

union in Lehnert lose. There was no -- it was 

acknowledged that there was nothing like that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Lehnert didn't 

address the question of litigation.

 MR. COLLINS: Well, but if -- but there has 

been no argument made that would explain why if you --

if one can pool -- if the union negotiates an agreement 

with a very controversial provision that a nonmember has 

a very legitimate objection to, Lehnert holds that can 

be pooled. Lehnert does not say the standard --

JUSTICE ALITO: Your argument seems to be 

that the whole analogy of a pooling arrangement is 

invalid. That was unrealistic, because there really is 

no way of telling whether any of these things is a 

pooling arrangement. There is no standard that could 

possibly be articulated that would be meaningful to 

determine whether something that is labelled a pooling 

arrangement really is in any way a pooling arrangement. 

That seems to me argument. That would seem to cut 

against the whole idea of pooling arrangements not only

for litigation expenses, but for everything else.

 MR. COLLINS: I have two responses to that, 

Justice Alito. First, the -- if one had to have the 

kinds of either guarantees or meaningful enforceable 

standards that are implied in your question, then in the 

nature of the beast, it could not be done by national 

unions, and we would be in a system then when all that 

can happen is that a local union has to rely solely on 

its own resources, solely on its own expertise. And 

it's doing that despite, as Judge Lynch pointed out in 

the concurrence, despite the dire impact that can have 

on its ability to represent people and it's doing it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it doesn't have to do 

that. It can use the money of its union members any way 

it wants. It can contribute to the national all of 

their money if it wishes. We are only talking about 

that portion of the union income which comes from people 

who don't want to join the union.

 MR. COLLINS: Well, then it either has to 

allow for -- the union has to either conclude we are 

going to support all of our germane activities, all of 

our chargeable activities through our own funding and 

our own resources, and if that's just inadequate and 

therefore litigation needs to be conducted, we can't do 

it; the employer knows that so it can take advantage of

us in bargaining; we are just going to have to live with 

it; or we can say our members will pay for that but the 

nonmembers won't, because the only solution other than 

using the local's own money is to pay a fee to the 

national. And as I've indicated in Lehnert as in this 

case, the arrangement is not one that provides 

guarantees --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, one of the 

difficulties it seems to me is the Petitioner's position 

with the sort of all or nothing approach. But you 

seemed to be taking the mirror position of that. Your 

argument is all or nothing on your side. I don't get 

much help from either side as to what the standard 

should be. I know germane is obviously a malleable 

word, but we are looking to see if there is some test 

that we can use that's not all or nothing.

 MR. COLLINS: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I haven't heard from 

either side yet what that would be.

 MR. COLLINS: The -- the question, Justice 

Kennedy, is whatever the test is if it's satisfied as to 

expenditures within the unit where the services are 

provided, can those services be pooled or is there a 

different test that has to be applied to the pooling? 

My submission is that Lehnert makes clear there is no

separate test.

 As to what the test is within -- and 

therefore, as to the question presented here, one 

doesn't need to decide on the actual test that will be 

applied within the local because as your separate 

opinion and Justice Scalia's separate opinion in Lehnert 

made clear, even under the narrower statutory duties 

test there could still be pooling; the definition as to 

what can be pooled would simply be different. I'd only 

note on the question of whether the tests should be 

germaneness with the two additional prongs as held in 

Lehnert, or the statutory duties test, that again is a 

question that's not presented here. As I just indicated 

it doesn't affect the concept of pooling.

 There has also been no confusion, contrary 

to Petitioner's contention, under the Lehnert test. The 

only issue that's given the courts difficulties is the 

specific issue here as to why the plurality in Lehnert 

seemed to indicate that litigation might be in a 

different status under pooling. So there is no basis in 

this case for reconsidering the basic Lehnert test of 

chargeability.

 I will simply note, however, that the 

statutory duties test which -- for which Petitioners 

argue really doesn't make the situation clearer than

the -- than the germaneness test because the 

Government -- both the germaneness test and the 

statutory duties test acknowledge that the union's right 

to charge objecting nonmember stems from its function as 

exclusive bargaining representative; but there is no way 

to sustain logically the notion that that means that 

only those things that are done in that exclusive 

representative capacity are chargeable; because the same 

Government interests that allow for charging when the 

union is acting as the exclusive bargaining agent have 

to also allow for charging for those things that are 

necessary in order for the union to play that role, and 

to enforce that role which includes things like the 

headquarters; it includes things like litigation to 

enforce an agreement, even though in those areas when 

performing those functions, the union very often does 

not have an exclusive representational duty or duty of 

fair representation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there a rule or a reg 

somewhere in the Labor Department that says if the 

national union takes its money from its local, spends it 

in a way that has nothing to do with politics 

whatsoever, zero -- but either wastes it or they build 

too big a building, or they do something that doesn't 

benefit Local Number 432, does 432 have any remedy?

JUSTICE BREYER: So union members who are 

being gypped, they just have to put up with it.

 MR. COLLINS: I would say there would be a 

breach of covenant of faith and fair dealing under the 

affiliation relationship in some of those situations; 

and of course if a union used an illegal basis for 

determining whether it would provide services to the --

could bring a lawsuit or not?

alleging that the union violated its covenant of good 

faith and fair dealing to its affiliates, if the union 

acted on the basis of say, race, for example, you could 

certainly bring a lawsuit then.

everybody in the union whether they're forced or not, 

has this kind of remedy or nobody does? That's your --

MR. COLLINS: Right. And the reason for 

that is -- what we always have to understand here, is 

the interest in seeing to it that a local union that 

pays an affiliation fee will receive services in a fair

way from the national is an interest that's shared 

equally by the members and the nonmembers. It's not 

something that creates a First Amendment concern.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not 

right. Again we have to postulate that we are dealing 

with members who don't like unions at all. So while the 

members may think this is perfectly fair, the nonmembers 

whenever their money is forced to be used for union 

activities, it's unfair.

 MR. COLLINS: But a -- a member equally with 

a nonmember would, Mr. Chief Justice, have the view that 

if it's predictable year after year that for some reason 

his local doesn't get services from the national union, 

the national union sends it elsewhere, that member is 

going to be no more happier -- happy than the nonmember. 

That's why those things don't happen in the real world. 

That's why we certainly don't need a prophylactic rule 

and there would certainly be no First Amendment basis 

for a prophylactic rule that requires the union to 

establish what no union in this country to my knowledge 

has, which is either a clear guarantee or specific 

standards for providing services.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF W. JAMES YOUNG

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. YOUNG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I 

think it's appropriate to note the apocalyptic 

predictions that are suggested from the rule that the 

Petitioners are advancing are avoidable by easily --

readily available alternatives. International unions 

would of course be free to make loans to local 

affiliates engaged in massive litigation or other speech 

activities where they think it's appropriate.

 But the alternative is not between 

prohibiting pooling arrangements which have no 

standards, no enforceability and no predictability, and 

allowing the nonmembers to become free riders on 

legitimate litigation expenditures funded through the 

international affiliate. The choice is between a 

malleable -- a malleable unpredictable and ultimately 

unenforceable agreement and a standard which would allow 

the international to subsidize such litigation and allow 

the true -- only the costs of that litigation to be 

extracted from nonmembers.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And the case -- the case 

that says that a union member, person forced into the 

union agency shop -- and I guess a lawyer who has to pay

join a medical association -- the case that says that 

these people have a First Amendment right to get back 

money that's being wasted, is what?

 MR. YOUNG: We don't suggest that there is 

such a right, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So unless it's political in 

your view, you don't have that right?

 MR. YOUNG: Unfortunately no, Justice 

Breyer.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The test is not 

whether it's political, is it? It's not a negative 

test. It's an affirmative requirement in which the 

burden is on the union that they have to show the 

expenditure is germane to the particular collective 

bargaining agreement?

 MR. YOUNG: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's 

exactly correct, and -- and the test in determining 

whether or not it is a -- can be charged across 

bargaining unit lines is a bright-line test of whether 

it is a speech activity.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, do you have a 

response to Justice Kennedy's concern? Do you have a 

fallback position or are you also in the all or

and/or under the duty of fair represent which of course 

is that wide range of reasonableness cannot be sustained 

where this court's standard is the least restrictive 

means. Thank you.
