3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 this morning first in Case 12-357, Sekhar v. United 

States. 

6  Mr. Clement? 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  The crime of extortion under the Hobbs Act, 

12 like the related crimes of larceny, burglary and 

13 embezzlement, is at bottom a property crime. 

14 Accordingly, understanding the scope of obtainable 

property under the Hobbs Act is critical to deciding the 

16 scope of the basic criminal prohibition. 

17  The Government has offered you a definition 

18 of property that only a prosecutor could love. Any 

19 intangible right with economic value, but that 

definition is fundamentally incompatible with this 

21 Court's precedence and with Congress's conscious 

22 decision in the Hobbs Act to criminalize the State --

23 New York State crime of extortion, but not the New York 

24 crime of coercion. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If the jury had -- had

1 returned the verdict, which is at JA142, and it had 

2 marked that the attempt to extort was to extort the 

3 commitment, you might still maybe have some causation 

4 arguments, but I assume the property argument you're 

about to make is just irrelevant. 

6  MR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't think it's 

7 irrelevant, Justice Kennedy. I would have a different 

8 argument. I think that I would stand first and foremost 

9 on this Court's decision in Cleveland, where it 

recognized that something like, I think the commitment, 

11 certainly the video poker license was at issue there, 

12 the Court also referenced an unissued patent. 

13  And it recognized that there are things that 

14 have value once they're issued, but in the hands of the 

Government, they don't have value, and therefore don't 

16 qualify as property. 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could -- could the case 

18 have been indicted -- has it been charged as one in 

19 which what they were taking was the commissions that 

would ultimately have been generated? 

21  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, it 

22 might have been possible to say that what was obtained 

23 here was money, but I think if the Government had 

24 prosecuted it under that theory, it would have to prove 

that somehow the Government paid too much. I don't 

4

1 think it can point just to the commissions. 

2  And I would analogize it to the McNally 

3 case. In the McNally case, you know, there was this 

4 scheme in which various sort of friends of government 

officials were getting the commissions from a workmen's 

6 compensation policy. And what this Court said is, well, 

7 it would have been one thing if the Government had come 

8 in and said that the Government paid commissions that 

9 were too high, or the Government had received inferior 

quality insurance. 

11  But what the Government did there instead 

12 was sort of take the shortcut and plead that what had 

13 happened is, the Government had been deprived of its 

14 interest in having the honest services --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, here, what the 

16 Petitioner wanted were the commissions, ultimately. And 

17 you can't commit extortion in order to get -- and that's 

18 real money. It's for the Government to answer, not you, 

19 but can -- do you have any idea why they didn't charge 

that? 

21  MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think the reason that 

22 they didn't charge that is probably practically twofold. 

23 One is that a commitment under New York law and practice 

24 is not quite as what it sounds, it's not really a 

commitment. And the best evidence of that is with the

1 last fund for this particular management company, they 

2 got a commitment from the State and there was no 

3 ultimate investment made. 

4  So there's a subsequent step down the road. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I see. I see. 

6  MR. CLEMENT: So I think that's part of it. 

7  The other thing I would say is as in 

8 McNally, I think they would have had to prove that the 

9 management fees were somehow excessive or something like 

that, so they -- they didn't do that. They focused on 

11 this recommendation. 

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I took you away from 

14 your argument about intangible property. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Clement, just along the 

16 same lines. What you're saying is that it still would 

17 not be extortion -- let's say somebody in your client's 

18 position runs an investment company, wants an 

19 investment, wants the fees that come along with that 

investment. Goes to -- let's say that there's a single 

21 person who gets to decide whether to make that 

22 investment, and so to pay those fees, goes to that 

23 person, threatens that person with something terrible 

24 happening to him. 

You're saying that that does not count as 

6

Official 

1 extortion, that there's a reason that the Government 

2 didn't charge it like that? 

3  MR. CLEMENT: I would say that that -- I 

4 would say a couple of things. I would say that's a 

harder case than the one I have before you today. I 

6 would say that I don't think that's actually extortion 

7 if what they charge is the commitment, not the money 

8 that goes -- that flows from the Government. And then 

9 what I would say -- and the reason I would say that is 

because of Cleveland. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, they want the 

12 investment with -- and the fees that come with the 

13 investment. So -- and that's why they're threatening 

14 the person. 

MR. CLEMENT: Right. And I would say that 

16 under McNally, in that kind of case, what the Government 

17 has to prove is that if they want to make the property 

18 the money interest that the Government is paying out and 

19 the person is obtaining, they have to show that there's 

some sort of excessive commission or excessive sort of 

21 management fee. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Even -- even though they 

23 wouldn't have gotten the investment and they wouldn't 

24 have gotten the fees absent the -- the threat of force 

or -- or violence? 

7

25

Official 

1  MR. CLEMENT: Again, that would be my 

2 position. And I think it would follow from this Court's 

3 decisions in cases like Cleveland and McNally because in 

4 McNally, of course, the people who were part of that 

fraudulent scheme, they were getting commissions from 

6 the workmen comp program. 

7  And the Government's theory was that just 

8 interfering with the Government's decision about who to 

9 give the workmen -- where to place the workmen's comp 

policies was enough of an interference to -- to support 

11 a fraud conviction. And this Court said no. And one of 

12 the things it then said is well, it would be different 

13 if -- if the Government went in and proved that the 

14 commissions that were paid were too high, or that the 

Government somehow got inadequate insurance. 

16  But if all they're doing is saying that 

17 what's going on here is sort of the interest of the 

18 Government in having its employees serve them honestly 

19 and in their best interest, and not in some third 

party's best interest, that brings you squarely into 

21 honest services. And nobody's saying that doing that's 

22 a good thing, but it's -- it's the traditional office of 

23 the State law crime of coercion. It's --

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's -- the coercion 

crime, at least under New York definition, requires 

8
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

25

Official 

1 force. And -- and here, it's a threat of exposure of an 

2 embarrassing fact. 

3  So what -- am I right about that, that the 

4 coercion, which is not a Federal crime but is a State 

crime, requires a threat of force to restrict another's 

6 freedom? 

7  MR. CLEMENT: I don't believe that's 

8 correct, Justice Ginsburg. 

9  This was charged by New York State 

authorities as coercion. So the very crime that 

11 Congress didn't incorporate into the Hobbs Act, the New 

12 York crime of coercion, was charged here, and it's my 

13 understanding that the New York crime of coercion, like 

14 the earlier version of coercion in the racketeer -- in 

the Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934, like the traditional 

16 model penal code definition of coercion -- it's the --

17 the threat part of it is the same as extortion. 

18  So it covers a threat to a person or to 

19 property. And it's been interpreted certainly to 

include threats to disclose information like this. 

21  So I think the real difference between the 

22 crime of extortion and the crime of coercion, both as a 

23 general matter and under New York law, is whether or not 

24 property is obtained. And that's ultimately what's so 

problematic about the Government's definition here 

9

1 because their definition is essentially the property 

2 includes the autonomy interest of a business to operate 

3 free from coercion. 

4  JUSTICE ALITO: What is your definition 

of -- of property? In your reply brief, you begin by 


6 saying that you're -- you are not arguing that the 


7 property has to be tangible and includes some forms of 


8 intangible property. 


9  How would you draw the line? 


MR. CLEMENT: I would say that for property 

11 to come within the terms of the Hobbs Act prohibition on 

12 obtaining property, it has to be alienable, 

13 transferable, moveable. That's the critical thing. So 

14 the distinction is not between alienable and 

inalienable. 

16  A patent is an inalienable -- I mean, 

17 rather, a patent is an intangible property right, but 

18 it's transferable, it's obtainable, it is sellable, and 

19 so it has the characteristics of things that I think 

come within the traditional definition. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: What about -- what about 

22 the mob goes to a grocer and says, you know, you're dead 

23 or something if you sell Cheerios, and the reason is 

24 because they have a monopoly, some other grocer who's 

connected has a monopoly. And they threaten him. Now, 

10

1 does that violate Hobbs Act? 


2  MR. CLEMENT: I think --


3  JUSTICE BREYER: What he did was -- and 


4 he's -- he's not going to sell Cheerios. 


MR. CLEMENT: Right. I -- I would say that 

6 that hypothetical that you've given me would be 

7 coercion, it would not be extortion under the Hobbs Act. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: Now -- now, in fact, 

9 they're doing it to get money, and they do get money, 

but via the means of the other grocer. And there is 

11 nothing in the words of this Act that says that the 

12 property has to be taken from the individual whom you 

13 coerce. 

14  It's easy to imagine situations where the 

coerced individual has a relationship, direct, special 

16 and so forth, with the person who has the money. So 

17 what happens when, say, the mob coerces the person 

18 without the property so that he will do a thing such 

19 that the person with the property gives them the 

property? 

21  MR. CLEMENT: I think, at least as I 

22 understand your hypothetical, where the relationship 

23 between the two parties, basically they are competitors, 

24 I would say that that's two distinct relationships. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now just make

1 it different. What they do is they get the assistant 

2 bank employee and they threaten him to do such a thing 

3 such as shout at a certain time where they know that 

4 that shouting will lead them to be able to rob the bank. 

I mean, you know, it's easy to think up. 

6  What I can't figure out here is, is there 

7 some requirement that the person who is coerced has to 

8 be the same person as the person who gives them the 

9 property. If the answer to that's no, then none of the 

Government's chamber of horribles is horrible because 

11 there's a way around it. 

12  MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think the answer to it 

13 is, it depends. I don't think I can give you a 

14 definitive that the --

JUSTICE BREYER: And you haven't found 

16 anything on this. You'd be making it up now, is that 

17 basically it? 

18  MR. CLEMENT: Well, what -- what I would 

19 tell you is I think the assumption of most of the cases 

is that the person that is the pressure of --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Is the -- is the one? 

22  MR. CLEMENT: Is the person who's offering 

23 up the property. This Court's --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that what the word 

"extort" means? You extort something from someone? It 

12

Official 

1 means you get it from him, you don't get it from some 


2 third party. 


3  MR. CLEMENT: I think that's basically 


4 right, Justice Scalia. What I would say, though, is I 


think there's an exception to the -- at least to the 

6 following extent, which I think it would be open to the 

7 Government, to basically say that within an entity, if 

8 you sort of put the pressure on one agent of the 

9 corporation and you actually get the money from another 

agent of the same corporation, that that's probably 

11 close enough. 

12  And so in this case, if the pressure was put 

13 on a particular individual and they obtained like actual 

14 cash from the Government, that might be a different 

case. But, of course, here what they received was this 

16 commitment, which I think is analogous to the video 

17 poker license in the Cleveland case, so I don't think 

18 that's --

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: But if you think the 

commitment is real cash, is a real contract, real cash, 

21 real property, right? Then it wouldn't matter under 

22 that -- under what you just said, that the threat was 

23 made to the general counsel rather than to the final 

24 person who issued the money, isn't that right? 

MR. CLEMENT: I -- I don't disagree with

1 that, Justice Kagan, but I think that's because they're 

2 all sort of agents to the same principal. And I'm not 

3 sure you get all the way to what Justice Breyer was 

4 suggesting, which you can sort of run it through 

competitors or something like that. 

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. But you wouldn't 

7 say, well, we're dealing with an organization, so it's 

8 only extortion if you threaten the person who writes the 

9 check? 

MR. CLEMENT: No. I --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: If you threaten the person 

12 who makes a recommendation to the person who writes the 

13 check, that's good enough. 

14  MR. CLEMENT: Exactly, Your Honor. But what 

I would also say is, you know, this is a real case and 

16 there are real jury findings, and as Justice Kennedy 

17 alluded to, there were a variety of theories of property 

18 put in front of the jury. They were invited to circle 

19 as many of them as they could, as many as they found 

satisfied, and the only one they circled was the 

21 recommendation. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Clement, what is --

23 I'm sort of trying to figure out why you're trying to 

24 get the word "property" to do the work of the "obtain" 

part of the statute because when you answered 

14

25

Official 

1 Justice Alito you were using the terms of "obtain" to 

2 define property, which is in my mind a sort of strange 

3 way to do things, okay? Property generally means value 

4 of some sort and you don't use any of those words in 

your definition. 

6  So what you're using in my mind, and not 

7 illogically, is to say that the second part of the 

8 statute has to do some work, so it has to mean that 

9 you're taking something of value away from someone else. 

That makes logical sense to me. And I understand the 

11 second piece of your argument, which is the 

12 recommendation -- not the recommendation, but his honest 

13 services were -- wasn't being given to your client, it 

14 was being given to the employer. 

So your client obtained nothing of value for 

16 himself. He didn't get anything transferred to him. 

17 And that -- that argument makes eminent sense to me. 

18 And I tease it out of your brief, but I don't know why 

19 you're trying to get our definition of "property" to do 

that work. 

21  MR. CLEMENT: Well --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why isn't the work in 

23 the "obtain" part? 

24  MR. CLEMENT: Justice Sotomayor, I'm happy 

to have you rule in favor of my client on "obtained" or

1 "property" and, as Scheidler II demonstrates, those 

2 terms are really kind of married together. And I guess 

3 the reason I sort of think that the "obtained" and the 

4 "property" should be construed together is twofold. 

One, structurally that's what the statute does. So when 

6 you're talking about, in a statute, property that can be 

7 obtained, I think that's a clue that you're not talking 

8 about property in its broadest manifestation. 

9  And you contrast that with, say, the Clayton 

Act that talks about disjunctively property and -- or 

11 property rights, and there you have a clue that Congress 

12 means a very broad conception. When it's talking about 

13 it in conjunction with "obtained," I think it has a 

14 narrower ambit in mind. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So take the Government's 

16 definition that property is anything of value. 

17  MR. CLEMENT: Right. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And let's 

19 assume because it -- as I said, that seems to have some 

sort of conceptual appeal. Then make the argument for 

21 me. 

22  MR. CLEMENT: Well --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then make your argument 

24 for me why this isn't an obtaining. 

MR. CLEMENT: Well, what I would say is

1 obtaining, as this Court made clear in Scheidler II, is 

2 not some metaphysical obtaining. I mean, the argument 

3 was made to this Court that the abortion protesters 

4 obtained the autonomy interest of the business in -- the 

clinics, in deciding whether -- who to serve and when to 

6 serve and when to be open and when to be closed. 

7  And this Court said no, and it said 

8 principally that that's not obtaining, but it's -- but 

9 it also noted, I guess you'd call it dictum, that 

what -- what -- obviously, what the Hobbs Act, based on 

11 its common law roots in extortion, is talking about is 

12 the kind of property that can be deprived, it can then 

13 be transferred, sold, exercised. 

14  And I do think. Just to get the second part 

of my answer out if I could, it's just -- the common law 

16 roots here are also where you see the definition of 

17 property can't be as broad as the Government suggests. 

18 Because extortion is one of the classic common law 

19 property crimes. The definition of property, for 

purposes of extortion, ought to be the same as the 

21 definition of property for larceny, embezzlement, 

22 burglary. 

23  You can't go into somebody's house and steal 

24 their honest services or their autonomy interests. So 

the kind of property you can obtain for purposes of the

4 person coerced here was a -- was a corrupt person and 

had put his recommendation out for bids. Okay? He 

6 said, you know, I'll -- I'll recommend whoever pays me 

7 the most money. Would that alter this case? 

8  MR. CLEMENT: I don't --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if then somebody 

comes in and says, well, I'm not going to pay you the 

11 money, but I'll -- I'll break your knees if you don't 

12 recommend me, would that be extortion? 

13  MR. CLEMENT: It would not, Justice Scalia, 

14 and I would say because -- if the State of Louisiana in 

the Cleveland case, if there was a corrupt official who 

16 was putting those video poker licenses on sale on the on 

17 the sly, I don't think that would change the result there. 

18 This Court said that those kind of government things do 

19 not have value in the hands of the government. The fact 

that somebody, you know, could sort of be corrupt and 

21 therefore have a little auction on the side I don't 

22 think changes that basic fact. 

23  I would say, too, that there's an important 

24 difference here between a hypothetical case where what

4  This is not a client who's trying to get --

like, you know, they wanted an opinion on how to 


6 incorporate in the State of New York and they thought, 


7 well, the lawyers are kind of expensive in the private 


8 sector, so I'm just going to coerce it from this 


9 government official. All they care about in this case 


is the bottom line, thumbs up, thumbs down 

11 recommendation. 

12  I don't think this case would be any 

13 different if there were an investment committee within 

14 the State government and you had to get unanimous assent 

to an investment and there was one holdout. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't that --

17 you focused on transferability when you began. Why 

18 isn't that completely transferable? I have leverage 

19 against this official and if you want him to recommend 

yes on your investment, you have to pay me a certain 

21 amount of money. And you can transfer that. You've got 

22 everybody in, say, you know, the association or whatever 

23 and you can auction that off. It seems to me it's 

24 perfectly transferable from the defendant to anyone 

else.

6 definition. But when you have these essentially voting 

7 or autonomy interests that are really -- you know, 

8 they're -- they're sort of inherently inalienable 

9 because this recommendation matters because it's the 

general counsel and the comptroller's office 

11 recommendation. And --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the 

13 lawyer's going to make recommendations in many other 

14 cases as well. And if you have an application coming up 

and you want a favorable recommendation, you can go to 

16 the -- the individual that has the leverage and say, I 

17 will pay you this much money if you can get the person 

18 to give me a favorable recommendation. And that's 

19 transferable from the person with the -- the leverage 

to -- to someone else. 

21  MR. CLEMENT: Well, the confident -- I may 

22 not be understanding the hypothetical. Certainly, the 

23 confidential information that the potential coercer has 

24 may be transferable, and under this Court's decision in 

Carpenter, that may be property. But the voting right

2 government's internal deliberative process, that really 

3 belongs to the general counsel, and he can't --

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just let me make 

sure that I understand your position. Suppose roughly 

6 these facts, the general counsel is threatened with 

7 something very serious, let's say violence, unless he 

8 makes a favorable recommendation. He does. They act on 

9 that recommendation, it's -- it's a substantial cause in 

making the investment, and the investment is made and 

11 they get the money. Violation? 

12  MR. CLEMENT: I would say no, but I would 

13 say it's a much more difficult case. And the reason I 

14 would say no is because the Government -- or I'd say 

potentially no. I would still say that the Government 

16 has to prove something more, which is that it's an 

17 investment where there either was not the optimal 

18 investment or they paid too high a commission. And --

19 and I take that from McNally. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but that's a 

21 causation argument, not whether or not you received 

22 property. 

23  MR. CLEMENT: Right, because -- but my point 

24 is simply that if the Government --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But so far as the property

1 point in my hypothetical, if the recommendation leads to 

2 the contract and the contract leads to the commission 

3 and the commission means money in your pocket, that's 

4 property. 

MR. CLEMENT: Yes. 

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so then we just have a 

7 causation argument, not a property argument. 

8  MR. CLEMENT: I think that's right. If 

9 what's obtained is money, and that's what the Government 

focuses its prosecution on, then that is -- that 

11 satisfies the property requirement of the Hobbs Act. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: It has to be more property, 

13 more money, more money in return for less services or 

14 something than otherwise. That's what you're saying. 

But I don't think that's -- I mean, right. But the 

16 answer -- go ahead because I -- that's the qualification 

17 you're making, the McNally qualification. 

18  MR. CLEMENT: Right, exactly. Exactly, 

19 exactly. So you obtained the property, so that box is 

checked, but the -- sorry. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about -- you said 

22 transfer, sell, but there's also exercise. And the 

23 theory is that the defendant sought to take away the 

24 officer's right to make this recommendation, take it 

away from the officer, exercise it himself. So why

1 doesn't it fit -- why isn't this an intangible right 

2 taken from one and exercised by another? 

3  MR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, I would say 

4 that what you've just articulated is exactly the 

Government's theory, and the problem is that I can use 

6 that same theory to take any autonomy interest and turn 

7 it into property that can be exercised, it can be 

8 obtained by somebody and then exercised by them in a way 

9 different from the way that the person would otherwise 

exercise it. 

11  And whatever -- I mean, you know, we're 

12 talking about one word in a three-word phrase in 

13 Scheidler II. And the first thing I would say is I 

14 think it's a mistake to read that phrase the way you 

would read a statute. 

16  But the second thing I would say is the one 

17 thing the Chief Justice did not mean with respect to the 

18 word "exercise" is it meant that it opened up a big gap 

19 so you could take every coercion case and turn it into 

an extortion case. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is this -- there is, I 

22 take it, no Federal crime that this conduct would fit? 

23 You said New York State has a coercion crime which you 

24 say this conduct might fit. But there's no Federal 

crime.

1  MR. CLEMENT: There's -- there's no Federal 

2 crime and that's the result of a very deliberative 

3 decision by Congress in 1946 in enacting the Hobbs Act. 

4 Of course, they had in front of them the model of the 

Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934 that prohibited both 

6 coercion and extortion. Congress made a conscious 

7 decision to, in the Hobbs Act, prohibit robbery and 

8 extortion, but not pick up the prohibition on coercion. 

9  And so there isn't a Federal crime directly 

on point, but it's a very conscious decision by 

11 Congress. And, of course, the New York crime on point 

12 is exquisitely on point because not only is there a 

13 coercion offense under New York statute, but it is an 

14 aggravated offense if the victim is a government 

official discharging their public duty. 

16  And so this is really a situation where the 

17 State courts have a crime that directly fits. It's 

18 as -- I mean, it's almost amazing because it's not just 

19 any State, it's the State of New York. And Congress, in 

passing the Hobbs Act, was looking at New York law. And 

21 they looked at New York law and they said, New York has 

22 a coercion prohibition and extortion prohibition. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And why did -- why did 

24 New York -- was the New York case dropped and the State 

officials urged the Government, the Federal Government,

1 to make this a Federal case? 

2  MR. CLEMENT: Well, I'd be happy to address 

3 that. What happened is there were some pretrial 

4 rulings. And one of the pretrial rulings gave the 

defendant an opportunity to do some discovery on the 

6 State government to figure out whether this was really 

7 done in the discharge of public duties or maybe this was 

8 sort of a political thing that was going on. 

9  And once that State law discovery happened 

into the government of Albany, all of a sudden the State 

11 prosecution didn't seem like such a great idea anymore. 

12 And the Federal prosecutors are just down the street, so 

13 they were very happy to lateral it to the Federal 

14 prosecutors and have them take it over. And because the 

Federal offense doesn't have an element of interfering 

16 with the public duty, they didn't have to worry about 

17 the discovery. 

18  And that is just a very concrete 

19 illustration of the problem of over-federalizing crime 

because this -- we're talking -- this is the opposite of 

21 the typical public corruption case where you think, 

22 well, maybe there are people in the State government who 

23 aren't going to -- State prosecutors won't be willing to 

24 prosecute one of the bigs in the State government, so we 

need the Federal Government to step in.

12  MS. HARRINGTON: Thank you, 

13 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 

14  I'd like to start, if I could, where Justice 

Kennedy began and ended, which is asking whether there 

16 would have been extortion if the jury had found here 

17 that what -- that the property that was obtained was the 

18 commissions at the end of the day after the investment. 

19 My friend Mr. Clement says no, no, no, McNally says no. 

But what McNally actually said was the case 

21 would have come out differently if the property that had 

22 been alleged to be deprived was either money or 

23 property, but it also said it would have come out 

24 differently if the Commonwealth had been deprived of 

control over how its money was spent. And that's the

1 type of property that's at issue here, control over a 


2 property right. 


3  Now --


4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Harrington, just to go 


back to Justice Kennedy's -- I mean, suppose -- was 

6 there a reason why it wasn't charged in what seems to me 

7 to be the simpler way, which is a threat was made in 

8 order to get an investment and in order to get fees to 

9 put in your pocket and -- and go away with, and that's 

extortion. So why wasn't it -- why wasn't that the 

11 theory of the case? 

12  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, he was charged with 

13 attempting to obtain the commitment, which in most cases 

14 ends up being the investment itself. That's not what 

the jury found was the property that was obtained, so 

16 it's not the verdict that we are here defending today. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think there's an 

18 obstacle to charging a case that way? Mr. Clement seems 

19 to think that there's an obstacle, that even though 

there's property in that case, there's some other 

21 problem with charging the case that way. 

22  MS. HARRINGTON: No, that's what I'm saying. 

23 What he's saying is that the obstacle is you'd have to 

24 prove that the State was out more money than it would 

have been if it had invested in the company it wanted to 

27

1 invest in. What I'm saying is no, McNally said the 


2 result would have been different if the State had been 


3 deprived of control, of the ability to control its 


4 money, and that's the property that would have been 


obtained in that kind of a case. Because property and 


6 control of property are just -- are just different 


7 aspects of the same property. 


8  This Court has said repeatedly that 


9 exclusive control of property is one vital aspect of 


private property. And that's the -- that's the type of 

11 property that was charged, that was -- that was obtained 

12 in this case. 

13  JUSTICE BREYER: The obvious problem, which 

14 you might want to address at some point, is that -- that 

if you take your definition that this recommendation, 

16 legal recommendation, is property and the fellow said, 

17 you know, I'm going to fix you if you don't do it, if 

18 that's property, we're back to the honest services 

19 statute because anyone in the government and anyone in 

business, indeed everybody, has a job and those jobs 

21 always require you to do things. 

22  So if every time somebody threatens a person 

23 and says, we don't want you to do the thing you're 

24 supposed to do, we want you to do the thing like this, 

well, then you're violating this property statute.

3 reaching, hard to reconcile with the abortion case --

4 the abortion clinic case, et cetera, and it is easy to 

reconcile with the honest services case. 

6  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I guess I would have 

7 two points. The first is that this is not about honest 

8 services because the victim here is not the State of New 

9 York, it wasn't the citizenry of New York. That's the 

kind of --

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, that sounds 

12 technical. You see, the problem I'm interested in is, 

13 by accepting your definition do we suddenly throw within 

14 the statute, which speaks of property, any time there is 

an appropriate threat which has as a condition the 

16 person doing the job differently? That's true of 

17 whether it's a postman, you know, any public official, 

18 any private official, anybody. 

19  MS. HARRINGTON: Whatever --

JUSTICE BREYER: That seems very 

21 far-reaching. So what's the answer? 

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just to add to 

23 Justice Breyer's question, it's -- suppose the 

24 secretary/typist is -- the stenographer is charged with 

typing the letter "I do not recommend" and they bribe

1 her and she says "I recommend." She has an interest in 

2 her integrity to give an honest transcription. Under 

3 your view, and this is what Justice Breyer is getting 

4 at, I think, that -- that secretary has property that 

you are taking. That's very far-reaching. 

6  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I want to separate 

7 again the question of what is property and when property 

8 is obtained. Under the Hobbs Act -- the Hobbs Act 

9 absorbed the New York State extortion law. And in 

that -- in the -- in the cases construing that law, they 

11 had construed the word "property" to include the running 

12 of a business, the engagement of a person in their 

13 occupation, and the doing of a job. People have 

14 property interests in doing those things because those 

are the source of economic wealth for those people. 

16 They generate a stream of revenue for people to live 

17 their lives on. 

18  Now, it's a different question -- not every 

19 time you interfere with someone's doing of their job are 

you obtaining that property. Here, what Petitioner was 

21 trying to do was not keep the general counsel from 

22 making a recommendation, he was attempting to dictate 

23 the substance of what the recommendation was. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I understand that. 

But I still would like an answer to my question, and

2  Every secretary in the United States who is 

3 about to write a recommendation for somebody to go to 

4 college or some other thing then is faced with a threat, 

you put in name such-and-such or put in yes instead of 

6 no, and is under your definition that person's property, 

7 that what she does the taking of property? The answer 

8 is either you think yes, in which case I would like you 

9 to defend it --

MS. HARRINGTON: Yes. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Or the -- yes. Okay. Then 

12 what conceivable ground? I'm not -- I don't want to --

13 that sounds a little pejorative, but I say, what 

14 ground is there for a definition that is so broad that 

it sweeps within it all working people in the United 

16 States in the performance of their ordinary jobs? 

17  MS. HARRINGTON: The ground is the general 

18 particularized meaning that the word "property" has 

19 obtained in the law, and including in New York cases 

construing the very law on which the Hobbs Act was 

21 based. 

22  A person has a property interest in running 

23 their business. They also have a property interest in 

24 doing their job. When -- when someone comes along and

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is -- I have a 

property interest in doing my job? I don't know what 

6 that means. I mean, just throwing words around. You 

7 are calling doing a job a property interest. Normally 

8 when I think of property, I think of something that can 

9 be conveyed. Can I convey the -- the doing of my job to 

somebody else? 

11  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, you can convey your 

12 labor to your employer in that sense. When you enter an 

13 employment contract, you are selling your labor to your 

14 employer. And the -- the extent of your right to do 

that job is then defined by the parameters of your job. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: But I'm not talking about 

17 my labor. I'm talking about my doing the job that the 

18 employer has assigned to me. 

19  MS. HARRINGTON: But that is your labor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not my -- not my labor

16 closest that comes to this abstract, "the doing of my 

17 job is property"? 

18  MS. HARRINGTON: I don't have an example of 

19 that, but what I do have are examples from the New York 

cases which were construing the New York State extortion 

21 law, and this Court has noted again and again that 

22 that's the basis that the -- for the Hobbs Act.

4 1893, I think, the -- the Court said that the running of 

a business was property. And in the Short case the 

6 Court said that, just the same way that the running of a 

7 business is property, a person's doing their job is 

8 property, and that that can be damaged --

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How was it -- could you 

tell us a little more? How was it taken? 

11  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, in those cases the 

12 property wasn't taken. Under the New York extortion 

13 law, the law used "property" in two different places, 

14 and this is noted in our brief. First, it was something 

that could be taken, that could be obtained through 

16 extortion. And second, it was -- one of the means of 

17 committing extortion was doing violence to property, it 

18 was harming property. And the court was construing 

19 property -- in those cases, it was -- it was in the 

latter sense of what qualified as harm to property. 

21  But the court said in the Short case, which 

22 is from 1911 -- the court noted that property is used 

23 in -- in both provisions, Section 850 and Section 851, 

24 and said it was construing it as it was used in both of 

those sections. And in that -- that was the case that

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Harrington, go back to 


4 the Scheidler example because that was a case where we 


said there was not extortion when there were threats of 

6 violence meant to close down an abortion clinic's 

7 operations. What you are suggesting is that if those 

8 threats of violence had been targeted at the abortion 

9 clinic's lawyer in order to get him to tell the clinic 

to shut down their operations because they were a 

11 violation of law, that it would be an entirely different 

12 case. Now, how could that be? 

13  MS. HARRINGTON: We -- that's absolutely 

14 what we are saying, in the same way that we said that if 

the target of the -- if the -- if the protesters, excuse 

16 me, had been trying to get the clinics, if they had been 

17 trying to take over the clinics and get them to provide 

18 a different type of service, to get them to be a 

19 restaurant or to provide a different type of medical 

service, then they would have been obtaining the right 

21 of the -- of the clinic the right to run -- to operate 

22 their business. 

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: So -- so you think if -- if 

24 they targeted the -- the clinic's lawyer or the -- if

2 whereas in the real case it wasn't? 

3  MS. HARRINGTON: Yes, because Scheidler came 

4 out the way it did not because there wasn't property at 

issue, but because there wasn't an obtaining. And I do 

6 think it's important to try to keep those two things 

7 separate. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, because there 

9 wasn't -- and there's nothing obtained either way. I 

mean, you are trying to change what the person is doing, 

11 but you are not getting anything from it. 

12  MS. HARRINGTON: But you are dictating the 

13 substance of what they are doing, and so you are 

14 obtaining their right to exercise their property right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that -- that's the 

16 problem with your New York cases as well. You -- you 

17 are focusing on property in another context, where the 

18 property is harmed, not whether property is taken. 

19 You -- you have neither a New York case nor any other 

common law case involving extortion where the property 

21 taken consists of somebody's doing his job. 

22  MS. HARRINGTON: It's true, but the New 

23 York courses -- the New York cases said that they were 

24 construing the word "property" to mean the same thing as 

used -- used in both places in the statute. 

36

1  And there is no reason to -- to define the 


2 word "property" to include the concept of being 


3 obtainable because the statute already separately 


4 requires that property be obtained before there is 


extortion. 

6  Just, if I can just note that --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure that 

8 obtainable property and -- and harmable property are one 

9 and the same thing, I'm really not. 

MS. HARRINGTON: They might not be, but they 

11 are both -- but property is property. That's our 

12 position, that there is a legal meaning of property, it 

13 includes the right to run a business, the right to -- to 

14 engage in an occupation. In a particular instance that 

property may not be obtainable and then there won't be a 

16 Hobbs Act violation. But you don't have to read the 

17 obtainability into the definition of "property." 

18  It's the same thing. The Hobbs Act also 

19 says that you can commit a violation by committing 

physical violence against property. Now, in their 

21 opening brief, Petitioner said, well, if something can't 

22 be physically harmed, it can't be property. We are 

23 happy to see in the reply brief they sort of gave that 

24 up by saying, "Okay, yeah. Well, business secrets are 

property. A patent is property. Those things can't be

1 physically harmed. 

2  But there is no reason to read "property" 

3 means different things. If something can't be 

4 physically harmed, it won't be the basis for liability 

under that provision of the Hobbs Act. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: You are -- you are 

7 contradicting what you yourself said a little bit 

8 before, which is that property means the same thing for 

9 both provisions --

MS. HARRINGTON: 

11 saying. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13 and the harming. 

14  MS. HARRINGTON: 

JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, that's exactly what I'm 

-- for both the obtaining 

That's exactly --

But it doesn't mean the 

16 same thing for the harming because there is some 

17 property that can't be harmed. 

18  MS. HARRINGTON: Right. But that doesn't 

19 mean that property means something different. It just 

means if it's property that can't be harmed, then it --

21 it won't be a basis for liability under that provision. 

22  I'm just saying you don't want to give a 

23 different definition to the same word used different

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I -- going back a 

3 little bit to Justice Breyer's question, how do you gain 

4 possession of someone's advice or how they do their job 

when it's not giving you a direct benefit, it's 

6 something that belongs to someone else? 

7  MS. HARRINGTON: What you are doing is --

8 what happened in this case is Petitioner was attempting 

9 to obtain control over the fruits of the general 

counsel's labor. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the problem, this 

12 obtaining controlled concept. 

13  MS. HARRINGTON: Right, so what --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because you're -- you're 

equating taking control with possession. And that's 

16 where I'm having difficulty. 

17  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, this Court has 

18 repeatedly said that property and exclusive control of 

19 property are just different aspects of the same thing. 

They're different sticks in the bundle that make up the 

21 property. 

22  Here, what Petitioner was trying to do was 

23 he was trying to dictate the substance of the 

24 recommendation, and in doing so, he was trying to 

exorcise the General Counsel's right to make the 

39

1 recommendation, his right to do his job, and that was 


2 his property. He wasn't just trying to keep him from 


3 going to work, he was trying to literally dictate what 


4 the recommendation was. And that's how it was charged 


in the indictment, that's what the jury found. That was 

6 where the obtaining came in. 

7  The -- the concept of property and control 

8 of property is well illustrated by this Court's decision 

9 in Carpenter. There the property -- one of the pieces 

of property at issue was confidential business 

11 information, which was taken from The Wall Street 

12 Journal. 

13  But it wasn't -- it wasn't really taken from 

14 The Wall Street Journal because The Wall Street Journal 

still had the information at the end of the day. What 

16 the Court found was taken from The Wall Street Journal 

17 was the ability to control, to have the exclusive 

18 control over the information. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: As I think about it in 

terms of the New York cases, as you write them up here, 

21 it sounds as if someone was trying to get control of a 

22 business. So I think business, land, labor, and 

23 capital. All right. I can see why somebody who's 

24 trying to get control of a whole business is trying to 

take land, labor, and capital. There may be no land

1 there, but so what. And -- but a person's trying to 

2 take control of another's job by just telling him what 

3 to do 2 percent of the time seems well across some kind 

4 of line. 

MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I mean, you might 

6 have an obtaining question if it's only 2 percent of the 

7 time. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. No attaining 

9 question. I'm just thinking is it reasonable to call a 

secretary doing one job which takes 3 percent of her 

11 time that hour property, in a way is that different from 

12 taking control of Macy's? 

13  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, you should --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and it seems to me 

that probably it is. 

16  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I guess -- I mean, 

17 it's sort of two -- two different kinds of responses. 

18 One is that when you're asking if something is property, 

19 you want to look at it sort of on a class-wide or 

aggregate basis. If you have one, single unauthorized 

21 download of a copyrighted song, that's not necessarily 

22 going to cause harm to the record company --

23  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I'm not worried 

24 about copyrights or other intangibles. 

MS. HARRINGTON: No, I understand.

1  JUSTICE BREYER: That's not the issue. 


2  MS. HARRINGTON: But I'm just saying you 


3 want to look at something in the aggregate on a 


4 class-wide basis, and persons doing their job on a 


class-wide basis is something that is economically 

6 valuable to them. And therefore, it's property. 

7  I lost track of what my second response was 

8 going to be. 

9  So anyway, the -- the Hobbs Act clearly was 

targeted -- was trying to get at racketeering activity. 

11 It was trying to get at organized crime families. And 

12 Congress knew that one of the main means that organized 

13 crime families use was taking control of businesses. 

14  Now, those cases might seem easier because 

taking control of a brick and mortar business may seem 

16 more obviously like property than taking control of a 

17 person's occupation or their job. But a person's right 

18 to labor is economically valuable to them and is 

19 property to them in the same way that the running of a 

business is. 

21  Now, Petitioner's view would -- if it -- I 

22 mean, his real view is that he'd want to wipe out the 

23 heartland of Hobbs Act organized crime prosecutions, but 

24 I think his fallback position is that he would want to 

wipe out any extortion of a business that provides

1 services instead of providing a tangible good. But that 

2 doesn't make sense either. 

3  If Petitioner had threatened harm to a 

4 plumber if the plumber didn't come and -- and fix his 

leaky faucet, he would have been extorting that 

6 plumber's labor, and the same thing for a gardener, if 

7 he tried to get a gardener to come and mow his lawn. 

8 Now, he wouldn't end up with anything tangible at -- at 

9 the back end, but what he would have taken from those 

laborers would be their right to labor, their right 

11 to --

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, yes, he would have 

13 ended up with something intangible in those 

14 hypotheticals. He would have ended up with the mowed 

lawn. He would have ended up with the thing that the 

16 service was providing them. 

17  MS. HARRINGTON: But he wouldn't --

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: The -- the problem here is 

19 that there is no obtaining of anything that the person 

is getting in your theory. 

21  MS. HARRINGTON: It's the same kind of 

22 obtaining here because he wouldn't take the mowed lawn 

23 from the -- from the gardener, he wouldn't take a lack 

24 of leaking from the plumber. What he's taking from them 

is their services in order to get a particular result.

1  It's the same thing here, he's trying to 

2 take from the General Counsel his service of making a 

3 recommendation that's in his client's best interest and 

4 he's trying to dictate the substance of the 

recommendation to try to get him to give a particular 

6 recommendation, a positive recommendation. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that valuable to me? 

8 Why is it valuable to me -- I can see how the job is 

9 valuable to me. I get paid to do the job. But why 

making one recommendation rather than another is 

11 valuable to me? I don't think it's valuable to me. 

12  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, that's why I'm 

13 saying --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: It's only because I'm an 

honest person that I want to make the proper 

16 recommendation, but to say that it has any economic 

17 value that I recommend A rather than B? It's -- it's 

18 totally neutral whether one is -- is more economically 

19 valuable than the other. 

MS. HARRINGTON: It has economic value 

21 because the lawyer's job is to give his advice in 

22 keeping with his client's best interest. It's the same 

23 thing as the record company. A single unauthorized

1 honest lawyer should do that, but that doesn't prove 


2 that it's economically valuable for the lawyer to give 


3 the right advice rather than the wrong advice. 


4  MS. HARRINGTON: It is. If Petitioner had 


tried to blackmail the General Counsel every week to 

6 give a different recommendation than what he wanted, the 

7 result would have been the General Counsel would have 

8 lost his job. He would have lost his stream of revenue. 

9 He might have been disbarred. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I see. I see. 

11  MS. HARRINGTON: That's economically 

12 valuable to him. It's the same thing as a single 

13 download of a -- of a record that might not cause 

14 economic harm to a record company, but it's still taking 

property because in the aggregate, the rights of that 

16 copyright or trademark have -- the property right has 

17 value to the record company. 

18  It's important to keep in mind the factual 

19 scenario here. Here, Petitioner was trying to use 

blackmail to coerce a State agent into doing something 

21 that was against his -- his will in order to get a 

22 $35 million investment from the State. Now, again, this 

23 might seem like a harder case than if he was trying to 

24 coopt the running of a brick and mortar business, but 

what he was trying to do is coopt an individual's doing

1 of his job. He's trying to dictate the substance of the 

2 recommendation. In doing that, he's obtaining property 

3 from the victim. 

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Ms. Harrington, I guess I'm 

just confused, and this goes back again to 

6 Justice Kennedy's initial question, why it wasn't 

7 charged in a much simpler way where the property is not 

8 a right by a lawyer to do his job, which seems no other 

9 person can get, but where the property was the contract, 

was the -- was the investment and the fees, and the 

11 theory was that a threat was used in order to get that 

12 investment and fees. 

13  And why wasn't -- why isn't that just -- you 

14 know, I look at the facts here and I say extortion, but 

not on your theory, on my theory. And why wasn't that 

16 simple theory used? 

17  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, it was charged on 

18 several different theories, and one of the theories was 

19 that he was trying to gain the commitment to the 

investment. Now, the jury was given choices. The jury 

21 circled the lawyer's positive recommendation as the 

22 property that was obtained. I assume that's because the 

23 evidence in the case, the e-mails from Petitioner to 

24 General Counsel talked about the recommendation and so 

that was a tangible thing in the jury's mind.

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is what --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But you don't think that 

6 there's any reason why it, in a future case, it couldn't 

7 be charged just the way I said it? 

8  MS. HARRINGTON: I don't think -- I think it 

9 could have been charged that he was trying to get the 

money here. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Was that one of the choices 

12 the jury had? 

13  MS. HARRINGTON: That he was trying to get 

14 the commitment, that was one of the choices. What they 

circled was the recommendation. Now, who knows why a 

16 jury does anything. I assume, like I said, it's because 

17 that was what the e-mails were about, they were about 

18 the recommendation. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I didn't think they 

circled recommendation. They circled his honest advice, 

21 didn't they? 

22  MS. HARRINGTON: No, they circled -- it says 

23 the General Counsel's recommendation -- this is on the 

24 JA 142. That's where it starts --

Official 

1  MS. HARRINGTON: JA 142. What they circled 

2 was the General Counsel's recommendation to approve the 

3 commitment. And I think that wording is very helpful to 

4 us because it's not just that he's trying to obtain a 

recommendation from the General Counsel. He's trying to 

6 obtain a particular recommendation, the recommendation 

7 to approve the commitment. I think that encapsulates 

8 both the property and the obtaining that is the theory 

9 of our case. 

The General Counsel's job was to give his 

11 legal advice. The Petitioner was trying to dictate the 

12 substance of that legal advice. His property interest 

13 was in doing his job. The General Counsel -- the 

14 Petitioner was trying to take control of the doing of 

the job, and therefore trying to take the General 

16 Counsel's property. 

17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it does seem to me 

18 important that you can't give us a common law case 

19 because common law is extortion -- at common law is 

extortion, it's usually the other way around. It's 

21 usually the official who's doing the extorting. 

22  MS. HARRINGTON: It was always the official 

23 who was doing the extorting. 

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: At -- at common law, could 

anyone ever extort an official, or we just don't have

1 those cases? 

2  MS. HARRINGTON: No. At common law, it was 

3 only limited to acts by an official. There was no --

4 and -- and the Court has recognized that when Congress 

enacted the Hobbs Act, it expanded the -- the reach of 

6 extortion in that sense, in the same way that New York 

7 did when it enacted the State extortion law. 

8  And I do think it's important to keep in 

9 mind that the -- the Hobbs Act is based on the New York 

law and we don't want to just ignore the New York cases 

11 that construe the word "property" to mean the running of 

12 a business and the doing of a job. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: But not the obtaining of 

14 property. 

MS. HARRINGTON: But it wasn't -- I mean, 

16 it's true there weren't cases --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true. Not the 

18 obtaining the property, right? 

19  MS. HARRINGTON: I concede that point. I 

concede that point. But it was -- it was defining the 

21 word "property" and that property is used twice. And so 

22 again, it's a separate question here whether the 

23 property was obtained. We think it's clear that there 

24 was property. We think it's clear the property was 

obtained as well, but those are two separate questions.

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you point 

2 out, of course, that it was based on the New York law, 

3 but what do you do with the point that they did not 

4 carry forward the separate crime of coercion, which was 

in the New York law but not in the Hobbs Act? 

6  MS. HARRINGTON: That's true -- I mean, it 

7 was a separate crime of coercion. There was a separate 

8 crime of coercion under New York law. I think, you 

9 know, the Congress conceived of the Hobbs Act as a 

property -- as a crime of -- against property, and so it 

11 didn't want to include coercion. It included extortion 

12 and robbery. 

13  Of course, every extortion crime --

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with 

the fact that the State authorities did charge it under 

16 coercion? 

17  MS. HARRINGTON: In this case. Well, I 

18 think it's important to note, and Petitioner doesn't 

19 mention this, that the attempted extortion charge he was 

initially charged with was a misdemeanor and the 

21 attempted coercion charge he ultimately ended up being 

22 charged with in State law was a felony. So I think that 

23 explains what was going on there. 

24  And it's a good example -- it's a good 

illustration of why it's hard to judge ex-post what

4 covered by coercion that wouldn't be covered by the 

Government's extortion theory here? 


6  Give me an example of -- of coercion? 


7  MS. HARRINGTON: So anything that doesn't 


8 involve property. So if you're trying to coerce --


9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, for example --


MS. HARRINGTON: So trying to coerce someone 

11 to marry someone they don't want. 

12  I think, in the Scheidler case --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why isn't that 

14 property? Why? You know, my -- my choice of marrying 

whom I want, why isn't that as much property as -- as my 

16 ability to -- to perform my job the way I want? 

17  MS. HARRINGTON: Because it's -- I think 

18 it's more properly viewed as a liberty interest. It's 

19 not a source of economic value in the sort of 

traditional sense. I think if you take the Scheidler 

21 case --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: A lot of people marry for 

23 money.

1 that one. 

2  I think -- so let's take the Scheidler case 

3 for an example. There were different types of property 

4 that were initially alleged in that case. One of them 

was the right of women to access the services of the 

6 clinics. 

7  This Court -- this Court distinguished that 

8 from the other alleged property interests, which were 

9 the running of the business that was the clinic. And 

the Court said that the right of women to access the 

11 services of the clinics was really more of a liberty 

12 interest and the running of a business was really more 

13 of -- it didn't say it was property because it didn't 

14 have to decide that, but it said that's really more in 

the nature of property. That was the property 

16 right alleged. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me you 

18 could characterize the right to work as more of a 

19 liberty interest than a property interest. 

MS. HARRINGTON: I think it's both. And 

21 so someone -- the general counsel could have been 

22 coerced in this case if he had been prevented from going 

23 to jobs, to his job. But here what Petitioner was 

24 trying to do again was to -- to take the substance of 

the job, where he was trying to take the fruits of the 

52

1 labor of the general counsel by trying to dictate the 

2 substance of the recommendation. 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you draw a 

4 distinction between extorting someone not to go to work 

and extorting him how to do his job once he's at work? 


6  MS. HARRINGTON: Not on the basis of 


7 property, but on the basis of obtaining. The former 


8 is -- there's no obtaining and in the latter there's 


9 obtaining because what you're doing is you are 


exercising the person's right to do their job. 

11  And the Court has said again and again that 

12 exclusive control of property is an essential element of 

13 all personal property, of all private property. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Why -- why, just as long as 

we are idly speculating, didn't you use 18 U.S.C. 875, 

16 "Whoever with intent to extort from any person," you 

17 know, "anything of value"? 

18  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, we did use it, and he 

19 was -- I mean, there are five convictions under 875. 

What happened is in this case we conceded that Section 

21 875 uses the word "extort." We conceded in the court of 

22 appeals that "extort" has the same meaning as 

23 "extortion" under the Hobbs Act. 

24  And so if there wasn't extortion under the 

Hobbs Act, there wouldn't be --

4  JUSTICE BREYER: -- is there some -- I mean, 

it just seems obvious you'd be in a much stronger 

6 position when you say that the recommendation not to buy 

7 or to buy a particular service from somebody is a thing 

8 of value. 

9  MS. HARRINGTON: That's true. In this case, 

again, we have treated them as the same. But I think 

11 you would want to reserve for another case the question 

12 whether Section 875 --

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Have they in the Court been 

14 treated as a thing of value means property? 

MS. HARRINGTON: I think "thing of value" is 

16 a broader term than "property." 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: So no. 

18  MS. HARRINGTON: Right. So we haven't made 

19 an argument about 875 here. We've conceded that 

whatever the result is as to the Hobbs Act would control 

21 as to 875. But I do think that's a question for another 

22 case if we don't prevail in this case. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it -- it at least 

24 makes available the argument that you don't have to go 

this far, that there are other provisions that would

2  MS. HARRINGTON: Well, again, I don't think 

3 we are going too far --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: So why -- instead of 

inducing us to define property so broadly that it's 

6 unrecognizable, as far as I am concerned --

7  MS. HARRINGTON: But, Justice Scalia, you 

8 have already defined it this broadly in cases dealing 

9 with Section 20 of the Clayton Act, the Due Process 

Clause, the scope of a court's equity jurisdiction. The 

11 Court has said that the running of a business is 

12 property. The Court has also said that pursuit of an 

13 occupation is property. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: We're talking about 

property for purposes of extortion, the common law crime 

16 of extortion. 

17  MS. HARRINGTON: I hear what you're saying. 

18 But what I am saying is that property is property. And 

19 it's true that in extortion the property has to be 

obtained for there to be a crime. That work is done by 

21 the word "obtained." 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think property is 

23 property. I think property can -- can have a -- a 

24 different meaning with -- with regard to various 

provisions of the law. And -- and the provision of the

1 law defining extortion brings with it a whole baggage 


2 of -- of common law cases. And that may well be 


3 different from the word "property" used in some other 


4 Federal statute that does not invoke the common law of 


extortion. 

6  MS. HARRINGTON: But this Federal crime of 

7 extortion brings with -- brings with it the baggage of 

8 the New York State extortion law, and the New York cases 

9 said in that law the word "property" includes the 

running of a business and doing a job. 

11  It's true that that wasn't the property 

12 being extorted in those cases, but that's what they said 

13 property means. And if you are worried that those 

14 things can't be obtained, you don't need to worry -- you 

don't need to have a special definition of property to 

16 take care of that because the Hobbs Act already requires 

17 that property be obtained before there is extortion, so 

18 there is no need to have a redundancy built in for that. 

19  Again, I can understand how -- how the main 

Hobbs Act, sort of heartland cases which involve the 

21 co-opting of a brick and mortar business, seem like 

22 easier cases. And you might want to draw a line between 

23 the running of a business and the doing of labor. 

24  But a person has a -- has a property 

interest in doing their job the same way that they have

Doing a job is a source of economic value to 

6 a person and the Court should construe it as property, 

7 and the right to exercise control over doing their job 

8 is also property.

12  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

13  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

14  MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

A couple of points in rebuttal. 

16  Ms. Harrington started by pointing to the 

17 language in McNally. And she is absolutely correct that 

18 at the same time that McNally got rid of the honest 

19 services prosecution that was brought there, they 

reserved two possible prosecutions. One would be the 

21 obtaining of money, where there was a difference in what 

22 the government paid for and what the government got. 

23  The other thing that she alludes to is 

24 there -- the Court did say, well, maybe there's a 

possibility that you could prosecute based on the

1 government's loss of control over its allocation of 

2 these workman's comp policies. 

3  The problem is, of course, that McNally 

4 precedes Cleveland. And in Cleveland, the government 

seized on that language and said, well, even if the 

6 video poker license isn't property, the right to control 

7 who gets it is property, and that got exactly zero votes 

8 from this Court. So I think that argument is no longer 

9 viable. 

Ms. Harrington also points to these New York 

11 cases about the scope of property for purposes of 851 of 

12 the New York Penal Code. But of course, what we're 

13 talking about is 850 of the New York Penal Code, the 

14 kind of property that can be obtained. I think it's 

common ground that -- they are not co-extensive. There 

16 are -- there is property that you can obtain that you 

17 can't threaten. 

18  Indeed, the classic thing you obtained in --

19 in an extortion case is money, and I'm not sure how you 

really threaten money. You can threaten to take money 

21 from someone, but you don't really threaten the money. 

22 So these are different terms. 

23  So relying on the Barondess case, which is 

24 the same case that Justice Stevens relied on in dissent 

in Scheidler II just doesn't work.

1  Now, she's also absolutely correct that 


2 extortion at common law only involved official 


3 extortion, but that doesn't mean that there aren't 


4 common law places to look for a relevant definition of 


property. Because the same basic concept was in the 

6 larceny statutes, the -- not statutes, the common law 

7 crime of burglary, larceny, and embezzlement. 

8  And indeed to this very day, New York refers 

9 to extortion as larceny by extortion. And if you go to 

those New York cases, the place I would point you to is 

11 the Ashworth case, which is cited in both of our briefs. 

12 This is a case that makes very clear that under New York 

13 law, they didn't even think that services at all were 

14 property. 

This is a case where the foreman of a mill 

16 gets the bright idea that he's going to do some work for 

17 his own company using the mill's facilities. And he's 

18 charged with larceny. 

19  And the court in that case says, no, that's 

not larceny, you didn't obtain any goods. Classic sort 

21 of common law property is in order to be the kind of 

22 property that you can steal or extort it has to be 

23 moveable. One of the elements of the common law crime 

24 is asportation, literally moving it --

1 finish --

2  MR. CLEMENT: And if I can just sort of put 

3 the point, they say all of that and they reject that 

4 argument. And they use a line which I think really 

captures what's going on here. They say, well, maybe 

6 you can conceive of such a conception of property, but 

7 they say to conceive this requires a certain 

8 intellectual flexibility which is probably not possessed 

9 by the average person. And I would simply submit it 

also is not the kind of flexibility that should be 

11 possessed by the average judge in a criminal case. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let -- look, I think if 

13 we take your argument to its logical conclusion, what 

14 you are telling us is, do away with the Second Circuit's 

Tropiano decision, and the large progeny of cases that 

16 come from it. 

17  The most common is the threat to a business 

18 that says pull out of this market because we don't want 

19 you in it. And we want all the customers. And courts 

routinely have said that is a Hobbs Act violation. 

21 You're using the threat of force to tell people to keep 

22 out of a particular market. 

23  Today you are telling us that under your 

24 theory of the Hobbs Act and your definition of property, 

that doesn't count as a Hobbs Act violation.

1  MR. CLEMENT: Well, a couple of things, 

2 Justice Sotomayor. I went back to the Tropiano case 

3 because it is sort of the pro genitor of this whole line 

4 of Second Circuit cases, and I noticed two things. 

One, I noticed it was written by a district 

6 court sitting by designation. So I mean, I -- I don't 

7 mean anything by that other than this is not Marbury. 

8  Second, I would say that the second thing I 

9 noticed is that the debt --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, I think when I sat 

11 as a district court judge, I would have been insulted by 

12 that. 

13  (Laughter.) 

14  MR. CLEMENT: Well, it's not -- it's a good 

thing you're no longer sitting in that capacity, Your 

16 Honor --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Okay. It's really is, 

18 for you. 

19  MR. CLEMENT: -- because I -- I certainly 

mean you no offense. You could write Marbury here. 

21  So the -- the difference is, Your Honor, 

22 that that could have also been, I think, actually 

23 prosecuted as a property crime because in that case, 

24 there were customer accounts that were obtained, and 

those customer accounts, as the facts of Tropiano

2 transferred from one business to another. 

3  So I think what would happen in the Second 

4 Circuit, if you decide this case the way we would like 

you to, is the Government's going to have to be careful. 

6 They're going to have to write their indictments to 

7 focus on things like money or obtainable property, and 

8 they can't get sloppy and put together these autonomy 

9 interests and call them property. 

Thank you, Your Honor.
