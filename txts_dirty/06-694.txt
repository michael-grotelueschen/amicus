 (10:02 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in case 06-694, United States v. 

Williams.

 General Clement.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 This Court has made clear that speech 

proposing an unlawful transaction is not protected by 

the First Amendment.

 And speech that falsely proposes an unlawful 

transaction is likewise unprotected.

 The statute at issue here properly construed 

does no more than prohibit efforts to offer or solicit 

materials that are contraband and then prevents somebody 

from turning around after soliciting or offering 

contraband and suggesting that the materials either did 

not exist or were not contraband after all. The statute 

does not prohibit truthful speech about lawful 

materials.

 Accordingly, the court of appeals erred in 

striking the statute down on its face.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if I could start 

with one of the more compelling hypotheticals on the

other side. Let's say I'm a movie reviewer. I write a 

review saying this is an awful movie. It portrays child 

pornography. Aren't I presenting information in a way 

that would cause others to believe that the movie 

contains child pornography, and wouldn't that be covered 

by the statute?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, we do 

not think that would be covered by the statute. We 

don't think that that would involve -- in the first 

point, we don't think it would involve presentation or 

promotion of the movie in the meaning of this statute.

 We think those terms are really limited to 

efforts to make the product available to the market.

 And I think if you read those terms in 

conjunction with each other, they are all directed at 

efforts to make the product available to the market.

 Now, so if the person whose actually 

distributing the film wants to try to market it as 

actual child pornography, then I suppose that would come 

within the ambit of the statute. But a movie reviewer 

does not have anything to worry about in the first 

instance because I don't think that would come within 

the term --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the distributor 

attaches the movie review. It's in amazon.com, and then

it has the movie review.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Again, Justice Kennedy, it 

might be conceptually possible for somebody to market, 

let's say a mainstream movie, on the basis of a --

either their own statement or an attached review, that 

misrepresents the nature of the movie and makes a claim 

for the movie, that it's actual child pornography. I 

suppose in that unusual circumstance, it would be 

covered. But I guess it would be equally possible for 

somebody to take one of the countless mainstream movies 

that portrays a murder on screen, and say this is 

actually a snuff film. There's actually -- this was a 

snuff film. This was an actual murder. Now, somebody 

who did that would be clearly misrepresenting the film. 

I don't think they would turn around if somebody tried 

to do something about that false or misleading speech 

and be able to defend on that speech because it would be 

clearly false and misleading speech.

 And I think what is important here is if the 

underlying movie is not child pornography, then truthful 

efforts to promote that movie won't be captured.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Supposing the underlying 

movie is a depiction of atrocities being committed in 

some foreign country, in a war zone or something, by 

soldiers who rape young kids. And so it comes within

the literal terms of the statute. And if one said I'd 

like to take a look at this movie, wouldn't that be 

covered by the statute?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: If the movie itself comes 

within the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The movie itself would be 

pictures of soldiers raping young kids.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: And if it were done in a 

sufficiently graphic way, that it was captured --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If the news -- I'm 

thinking of the news reel -- somebody makes as exhibit 

at a war crimes trial, or something like that -- sees 

this actually happening. Now, as I understand the 

language of the statute, if the person who had that film 

described it to someone he wanted to send it to, he 

would violate the statute.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Stevens, 

there's -- I guess there's an anterior problem, which is 

if the depiction were sufficiently graphic --

JUSTICE STEVENS: They are.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: The person that would have 

that film would be in possession of child pornography, 

which itself would be a problem under the statute. He's 

in the possession of it.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Depiction of a war crime

taking place? He saw that on camera -- that would be a 

crime?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: And that might be an 

example where, starting with the basic prohibition on 

the possession of child pornography, that might be a 

situation where there was a valid as-applied challenge. 

And that also might be a situation where there would be 

a valid as-applied challenge to the pandering and 

solicitation provision. But I think the proper way to 

analyze that is to ask first whether or not something is 

covered by the basic prohibition.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You do agree I guess that 

there are some -- there would be some valid as-applied 

challenges to this statute.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I agree, and I think in 

theory, at least, there may be valid as-applied 

challenges to the underlying prohibition. And this 

Court of course in Ferber recognized that possibility in 

upholding the basic prohibition on the promotion of 

child pornography in that context.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Ferber confined the 

meaning of child pornography to, I think, the greater 

extent than this statute does. It talks about artistic 

value, but this -- there were several examples given in 

the briefs. One was this film depicts 12 year old child

having sexual relations with an old man. Now that 

statement could be perceived as this film shows child 

pornography.

 Just that statement. But it's a truthful 

statement about Lolita, is it not?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: It is, Justice Ginsburg 

but I think in context that would not be something that 

comes within the ambit of the statute. And again, if 

you start with the proposition that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not? If you say --

if you say, 12 year old child -- this film shows a 12 

year old child, and it doesn't tell you that the person 

who's playing a 12 year old is a young adult?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I understand that, Justice 

Ginsburg. What I would say is this statute in order to 

apply, at least the way we interpret it, requires both 

an objective and a subjective component. And so you 

would have to have a situation where that promotion of 

the movie objectively would lead somebody to believe 

that you're marketing in a manner that portrays it as 

actual child pornography. Now I think what you've just 

said right there would probably fail at the objective 

test because I think particularly when you start talking 

about it being a motion picture and the like, the 

natural assumption -- let's say it's a mainstream motion

picture, is going to be oh, that's just actors, it's 

probably adult actors, or a body double or something. I 

don't think that comes within the statute.

 The other thing that's required, of course, 

is a subjective component -- specific intent is the way 

that we would read the statute. And clearly the person 

who's marketing Lolita itself and wants people to go see 

it in a mainstream box office does not have the intent 

to convey to people that this is actual, forbidden child 

pornography.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well what if an individual 

received actual child pornography in the mail that had 

not been solicited. And he calls the chief of police in 

town and says I just opened my mail, and this envelope 

is full of child porn. And he's right. I mean, there 

are no body doubles. This is the real thing in here.

 He has presented child pornography to that 

chief of police and he's violated the statute, hasn't 

he?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Souter, I would 

say that the better answer is no, that he has not. Now 

JUSTICE SOUTER: You say no, but you say no 

because we won't enforce it that way. But the -- but 

the objective component and the subjective component in

my example are both satisfied.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Souter, I would 

say no for a more fundamental reason, which is I think 

you have to read two provisions of the statute here in 

pari materia. And the other provision I think that is 

relevant is the affirmative defense that's in subsection 

(d) of the statute, which is at 6a of the appendix to 

our opening gray brief. And that provides an 

affirmative defense in the situation where somebody is 

in possession of child pornography.

 Now, the first problem the person who gets 

child pornography in the mail has is that the statute --

the bans of possession would apply. Now, there's an 

affirmative defense. The affirmative defense is 

specific to possession, but one of the things that's a 

prerequisite to qualify for the affirmative defense, 

which is in (d)(2)(B) is that you have to afford that 

material -- you have to afford the agency, the law 

enforcement agency, access to the material. Now --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- that's fine, but 

before you get to that point, you have -- there's still 

an indictable offense. You don't prevent -- you don't 

present affirmative defenses until you're already 

indicted.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: You're right, Justice

Souter, but that is a problem both for the prohibition 

on possession and it is not a unique problem for the 

pandering solicitation provision. And I don't think the 

fact that you might have to if -- in that situation, you 

might have to actually present your affirmative defense 

in some case is a reason to strike a ban on possession 

as overbroad. But the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But the ban on possession 

is not the real problem because, under a normal 

possession statute, you would indeed have a problem not 

merely in terms of -- that could be raised not merely by 

affirmative defense but as an element of the statute. 

If the possession is merely a matter of happenstance, 

there's an intent problem and presumably there's no --

there's no offense. There's no knowing offense in 

acquiring material for the possession.

 But in the pandering statute, what we've got 

here is there is -- as you put it earlier, there is an 

understanding which happens to be correct, objectively 

correct, that there is child porn, and there is a very 

clear intent to convey that message by way of presenting 

this material to a third party, in this case the police. 

So I think this is not merely comparable to the problem 

of haphazard possession.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, let

me try two responses. One is I do think you have a 

problem even in possession because once you get it in 

the mail, your possession of it is knowing. And that is 

precisely why Congress included this affirmative defense 

in the statute. The second thing I would say though is 

again, we have to read these statutes in pari materia, 

and if one of the ways you qualify for the affirmative 

defense is you afford access to law enforcement agency 

of the material, I don't think that which is a 

prerequisite for qualifying for the affirmative defense 

can be independently prohibited --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What if --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- by the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if you call up your 

neighbor and say God, I got this disgusting child porn 

in the mail?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well -- and, again, I 

think if you did no more than that, I don't know that 

you would necessarily be covered by the statute, but if 

you said I got this disgusting child pornography in the 

mail, it's clearly unlawful, here take a look, I mean I 

suppose that is covered by the statute. But that 

doesn't seem like a natural reaction.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Indeed, it is covered by 

the statute because I read your brief as saying that the

statute applies only in instances where either you're 

trying to sell it or trade it. That is what you're 

trying -- now it seems to me a different matter if it's 

covering only -- covering as well instances where 

somebody's simply showing it to someone else to show him 

what he got in the mail. Well, I'd appreciate clarity 

on that.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Breyer, I think 

that we would take the position that even if you are 

presenting the material, making it available, but you're 

not charging for it, you're not exchanging it, you're 

just offering it for free, here's a quick free look, 

it's still covered by the statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If that's covered by the 

statute, what you're going to do then is suddenly 

criminalize what could be an awful lot of activity that 

goes on in schools all over the place and somebody 

has -- they think it's funny, and maybe it isn't funny, 

but they think it is and it's kind of school-boy 

behavior, and they're showing this stuff around, not 

totally certain what it is. Suddenly that can become a 

Federal crime. Seems like quite an extension. And I 

thought you'd written your way out of that problem, and 

now I think you haven't.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, I

mean, you know, I think you could certainly interpret 

the statute to write around that problem if you wanted 

to, but I do think the most natural reading of the terms 

"promotes, distributes, presents, and advertises" is to 

capture not just somebody who is making that available 

to the market for sale or for barter, but also somebody 

who says look, I have child pornography, I want to get 

you interested in this, this is the real stuff, here 

take a look.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's a very 

different thing. I read your brief the same way Justice 

Breyer did and particularly footnote 4 of the reply 

brief, which I understood to be giving "presents," for 

example in this statute, a promotional meaning in light 

of the other words around it, "advertises, promotes" and 

simply telling your -- you know, your neighbor, I got 

this, what should I do about it, isn't promotional. It 

may be in a technical term "presents," but it's not 

promotional.

 And, again, I understood your brief to 

suggest that you have to interpret all of those words in 

an advertising, soliciting sense.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, 

here -- I mean I think my first cut at drawing the line 

would to be say it's not a problem to say, can you

believe what I got in the mail, and talk to your 

neighbor about it, describe it.

 On the other hand, I do think you're 

presenting the materials if you say, I got this in the 

mail, look at this, isn't this disgusting, this is 

clearly child pornography.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then take it as 

that.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: If you think though --

JUSTICE BREYER: Take it as that. I would 

say looking and presenting to schoolmates dirty pictures 

is a fairly common adolescent and post-adolescent 

activity. And I would suspect a very high-level 

percentage of that class of people don't examine too 

carefully what the age of the individuals depicted is, 

and many might misrepresent what that age is. So this 

sounds like a statute that has enormous reach, whereas 

previously I thought it hadn't.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Breyer, if 

you think that's the difference between expanding this 

statute in some enormous way and not, then I would 

invite you to have a more restrictive view of 

"presents." And we certainly want you to interpret the 

statute in a way that renders it not overbroad. And, of 

course, this Court has made clear on a number of

occasions that, before you get to the overbreadth 

analysis, you are applying the early constructions to 

make sure that the statute if possible --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- is construed to be 

constitutional. But if I could just -- I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I just wanted to clarify 

the footnote to which the Chief referred, that footnote 

4 in your reply brief.  It says, to the contrary, the 

government's brief expressly acknowledges that the 

statute's proscription encompasses noncommercial speech.

 So I think Justice Breyer's suggestion that 

you said in your brief, that the statute is limited to 

commercial speech, is something that you -- say, no, 

that's not so; we say it encompasses noncommercial 

speech.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

think there may be a distinction to be drawn. We 

certainly don't think that it's limited to commercial 

speech if by "commercial speech" you mean only efforts 

to buy or sell or even only efforts to barter. Because 

we think that somebody who sort of systematically is 

operating a web site where they are giving away child 

pornography and advertising it as such would be clearly 

covered by the statute.

So, to the extent that the distinction 

between commercial and noncommercial is at the line 

where you would say you're giving it away gratis, we 

think that's still covered. Now, I gather that maybe 

Justice Breyer had a different conception in mind, that 

you really have the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My understanding was 

not that it was limited to commercial speech. That was 

clear from the footnote that I cited. But that 

"presents" was limited to promotional activity. It's 

one thing to present and say either whether to law 

enforcement or your neighbor; it's another thing to 

promote the child pornography. And I thought your brief 

was adopting a limited construction of words like 

"presents" that would cover only promotional activity.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, in fairness, 

Mr. Chief Justice, I think we had a slightly broader 

conception of "presents." What we were thinking that 

"presents" means is really when you are not just sort 

of -- you know -- in some abstract way talking about 

presenting the material, but you're actually furnishing 

the material to somebody else.

JUSTICE ALITO: Is there anything to suggest 

that some of these hypotheticals, where people get child 

pornography unsolicited in the mail or that kids at 

school are showing each other not just dirty pictures 

but actual child pornography, are situations that occur 

with any frequency in the real world?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Not at all, Justice Alito, 

and I think that's an important point with respect to 

Justice Breyer's hypothetical. I mean you have to 

remember that the materials that we're talking about 

here are in the main materials that are unlawful even to 

possess. And it is also true that the -- in the wake of 

Ferber, a pretty good job was done of getting these 

materials out of the real world. So the kind of 

pictures that are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I 

lost -- in your answer, I lost a negative or something. 

Are you saying that this type of activity frequently 

occurs or infrequently occurs?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Infrequently occurs --

especially in the real world, which is to say when 

pictures or magazines are being handed around from 

adolescent to adolescent, there is really no reason in 

the world to suspect that what's being handed from 

adolescent to adolescent is child pornography as opposed

to adult pornography -- Playboy and that sort of thing.

 Because the truth of the matter is in the 

wake of Ferber, a pretty good job has been done in 

stamping out child pornography in the real world. It 

has moved, unfortunately, on to the Internet. And, in 

that context, when people are promoting it as actual 

child pornography or soliciting it as actual child 

pornography --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The universe of child 

pornography includes activities of 17-year olds.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: It does, Justice Stevens, 

but so, too, for the basic prohibition. And I think 

what's important here is there may be some definitional, 

you know, questions. Or you may have a view that there 

are applications of the statute that would be 

unconstitutional.

 But what's important, I think, is that this 

pandering and solicitation provision doesn't add some 

new definition, some more aggressive definition. It 

simply picks up the notion of the basic definition of 

child pornography, and it says that if you're taking 

materials and you are offering them to the market as 

actual child pornography, if you are soliciting actual 

child pornography, then the government can go after the 

direct acts of solicitation and offering and -- and --

prosecute those acts without --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though -- even 

though what you are, in fact, showing or presenting does 

not fit the definition? Even if what you're showing --

you say, have I got some hot child porn and here it is, 

and the "it" is -- is -- an adult pretending to be a 

child, or a virtual image.

 So the -- the problem is not an accurate 

representation that this is hardcore porn, and it is, 

but saying, have I got the real stuff, but what you 

present is not at all the real stuff.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: That's right, Justice 

Ginsburg. If the scienter requirements are satisfied 

and I'm consciously trying to get you to believe that 

even though I have something that for some technical 

reason is not the real thing, what I'm offering you is 

the real thing, the statute does target that. But that 

seems to me to not be a First Amendment problem.

 It seems to be a natural consequence of 

Congress taking the Court's advice in Free Speech 

Coalition and moving from a prohibition on materials 

that had been pandered to the actual acts of pandering 

and solicitation themselves.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And is that your answer to 

the -- all of the hypotheticals that are put forth in

the Coalition for Free Speech, the Catholic Bishops, the 

advertisement in amazon.com or Netflix, then?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy, we 

think that all those hypotheticals are taken out with 

more than one reason. I mean, I think from the Catholic 

Bishops --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's -- pardon me.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Sure.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume for the 

moment that there are minors, so that the content aspect 

of it is film.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Oh --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That there are real minors 

in some of these things.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: But are there real minors 

engaging in forbidden activity?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Actual child pornography?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, if the underlying 

material is actually child pornography, then you may be 

in a different situation. All of the hypotheticals in 

that brief were with materials -- the underlying 

materials were not child pornography.

 And I think that's an important distinction,

because if you're taking a movie like "Traffic" or 

"American Beauty," which is not child pornography --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: -- and you're simply 

truthfully promoting it, you have nothing to worry about 

with this statute.

 Now, if you took something -- I also think 

that the Catholic Bishop situation isn't covered, 

because that is not promoting, presenting and 

distributing --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If one had a hand held 

video at a school or something like that?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I mean, again -- I 

mean, if you had a hand held video and the video itself 

was child pornography, and then you got that on the 

Internet or otherwise and decided you wanted to promote 

that, I mean would be covered by the statute. But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: There are two things that 

you -- that all of us have to work with here. One is 

the scienter component here. Is that overly broad, 

vague, and so forth? The other is the content.

 And my concern is the same as that indicated 

by Justice Stevens at the outset. There are some 

terrible practices in the child-trafficking area where 

children are held in brothels for the most debased of

acts. There are abuses in prisons, abuses in schools.

 If there are videotapes showing those 

things, it seems to me that the statute is -- that 

they're clearly covered by the statute, and maybe even a 

killing of a little girl in public might be sadistic. 

Assume that that's covered by the statute.

 Is there anything in the "presents" and the 

"promotes" language in the scienter component of the 

statute that gives some protection to these materials? 

Is it just as-applied? Is that what we have to do?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Here is how I would try to 

analyze it, Justice Kennedy, which is I would say that 

there would be an as- applied challenge there because 

the basic prohibition on child pornography that would 

apply to the underlying materials, there would be an 

as-applied exception to that. And therefore, the 

pandering and the solicitation of that would be equally 

outside the constitutional --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we want the public to 

see this to show them how bad it is, and that is 

permitted under the statute, because it is not 

"presenting"?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: I mean there would be 

another way to try to get at that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree with you that we

have different motives.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm not sure that the 

statute covers that.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, there might be a way 

in which the statute could cover it, and it would be, as 

follows, which basically is if I'm going to portray that 

as material that is -- and I'm going to portray it only 

in a way that makes it clear that I have a valid 

as-applied challenge, then I'm not sure I would be 

satisfying the objective and the subjective scienter 

requirements for that statute. Because it would be 

clear that, although I was presenting it as visual 

depictions of children who had that happen to them, I 

was presenting it exclusively for its scientific, 

artistic, literary value. And, therefore, in a sense, I 

was building my as-applied challenge into the way I was 

marketing it. I think you could --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, you have a 

problem not just with the presenting, not just with the 

pandering of it. You have a problem with the mere 

possession of it. You have to find some exception for 

that anyway. You have to find some as- applied 

challenge exception for the mere possession of it, even 

if you don't pander it.

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, 

that's exactly right. And that's why I would think the 

logical way to proceed would be you would find an 

as-applied exception to the basic prohibition. And 

then, naturally, that would apply to the pandering 

provision.

 I was only sort of suggesting, if pressed, 

that in some ways it might actually be easier to find a 

way to get that outside the statute with respect to the 

pandering and solicitation provision than for the 

possession for this.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But how would you do it in 

the case -- you mentioned that if there is not actual 

child porn shown, and there is a truthful or honest 

statement about it, that there is nothing to worry 

about.

 But what about the movie reviewer who is 

reviewing the latest re-release or something of the 

"Lolita" film and says this depicts sexual activity with 

a minor?

 That statement is true. It would be taken 

by some naive people as saying boy, this is what it 

shows, the real thing. That is a truthful statement. 

And yet, it would still fall within the prohibition of 

the statute.

As I understand your position, the only way 

that statement would be truthful in a way that would 

excuse would be if the reviewer said this depicts sexual 

activity with a minor, but of course the actor wasn't 

really a minor. Isn't that correct?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, that is not correct, 

Justice Souter. And I would say that that hypothetical 

is outside the ambit of the statute for two reasons.

 First of all, I don't think that the movie 

reviewer is promoting or presenting the underlying 

materials. They would be out for that reason.

 I also think they would be out because, when 

you started applying the objective and the subjective 

requirements of the statute, you would not find either 

of them satisfied with respect to that.

 If I know you're talking about a mainstream 

movie, and you say it depicts sex with a minor, I'm not 

going to naturally think that comes within the ambit of 

the statute, that it is actual child pornography within 

the meaning of the statute.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What if you are 17 years 

old and you haven't gone to law school and you haven't 

read these cases? You may very well assume that.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice 

Souter, that's why I think it is important to have both

an objective and a subjective requirement. And I think 

the objective requirement alone would take that out.

 If I could reserve the remainder of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we use a seven year old 

for the objective requirement?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: No, I wouldn't think so.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We would use a --

GENERAL CLEMENT: I think we would use a 

reasonable person. That's why --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- reasonable adult, I had 

thought.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Exactly, and that's why I

we use a reasonable personal of the sort who goes to 

movies?

 GENERAL CLEMENT: That would be fine, 

Justice Souter, and if --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I would suppose my 17 year 

old, non- law-school graduate would be within the ambit 

of the reasonable class.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: And I would submit that 

even a 17 year old, non-law student would know that 

movies depict things that don't actually happen. When 

they see a murder on screen, that's not actually a

murder. And so I think they would understand that 

that's a movie. It's not child pornography.

 If I may reserve the remainder of my time.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You could -- just one 

question. You mentioned a film, "Traffic," which I did 

not see, but one of the briefs said there was an actual 

17 year old playing that part.

 But you said that wouldn't be -- that 

wouldn't fit.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: "Traffic" is not child 

pornography. I understand that the actress was 17 at 

the time of the film, but we don't think that comes 

within the ambit of the basic prohibition on child 

pornography, because we think that simulated sexual 

activity has to be interpreted with enough subtlety that 

it doesn't capture that. And that's the position --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the statute says 

simulated.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: It does. But so does the 

statute in Ferber. And we don't think that introduced 

any overbreadth or vagueness that was fatal. This 

statute here just picks up on that definition. It 

doesn't add to it.

 If I may reserve --

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD J. DIAZ

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. DIAZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The pandering provision of the PROTECT Act 

carries a 5-year mandatory minimum prison term and a 

possible 20-year prison term, has no affirmative defense 

provision. It is unconstitutionally vague and 

overbroad, because on its face it captures protected 

speech about materials. And it captures speech about 

materials that may not even in fact exist.

 The language "in a manner that reflects the 

belief, or that is intended to cause another to 

believe," does not sufficiently define prohibited 

conduct giving law enforcement unfettered discretion to 

subjectively enforce the statute.

 In essence, as the Eleventh Circuit held, 

the determination does not rest on what materials 

contain, but rather on how someone conveys his or her 

impression about what the materials convey. In other 

words, this statute, in short, punishes thought, 

beliefs, expressions, and opinions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there's a

difference, isn't there, between beliefs and thoughts 

about -- what, the legality of a particular type of 

pornography or something like that, and a factual 

matter? I thought this was child pornography? Saying 

this regulates thoughts and beliefs, those are two quite 

different questions, aren't they?

 MR. DIAZ: Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice. 

And one of the problems with the statute, and just 

another example of what we've been talking about here --

amazon.com and Netflix -- there's also, for example, a 

series of photography that we've seen nationwide by 

famous photographers of minors or children, 

photographers of child modeling agencies --

JUSTICE BREYER: But none of those -- I 

mean, we've gone through this with the Solicitor 

General. He went through every example in his brief 

that you've been able to produce, and he said they 

aren't caught by the statute. What's wrong with what he 

said? Why isn't that so?

 MR. DIAZ: If --

JUSTICE BREYER: Photographers, for example. 

That's not child pornography. And if it was, they would 

have to act -- if it is child pornography under Ferber, 

it isn't protected. If it isn't child pornography under 

Ferber, well, then there's no problem. Okay. That's

their view of the photographers. And the same with 

Amazon, the same with Netflix.

 MR. DIAZ: Correct. The problem is if I 

were to take anything such as the CNN video of an actual 

sexually explicit conduct involving a minor, or if I 

were to take any of these films, if I were to start an 

Internet blog and say, look, this film contains sexual 

conduct of a minor, and I think we should do something 

about this, I think we should form a coalition or I 

think we should boycott it. And I am conveying the 

belief. I am intending to make you believe that what 

those materials contain, albeit what they really have or 

what they really are, is illegal.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Problem with Ferber, you 

said. Same problem.

 MR. DIAZ: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So what's your response to 

what he said? It is the -- with possession. You 

possess these materials. What you are trying to do is 

take them to the police and stop them. Under Ferber, is 

that protected or not? If it is protected, as I think 

it would be, so is it here.

 MR. DIAZ: I do not think it would be 

protected.

going to go right to jail because he has them. I would 

think it would be protected. I can't imagine somebody 

who collects, on these sites where they are molesting 

children, material to prevent children being molested 

and presents it to the proper authority is going to be 

prosecuted under the New York statute in Ferber.

 MR. DIAZ: If the material substantively 

violates the statute, then the mere possession of them 

is illegal. And there is a defense under the possession 

part of the statute for presenting them to the police 

within a certain amount of time and within a certain 

manner of your conduct.

 What we're talking about here is not the 

possession of the materials. We're talking about the 

expression about what the materials contain. Even if 

you're wrong about it, even if you're mistaken, even if 

you're lying about it, even if you're bragging about it, 

the traditional prankster, as Senator Leahy said in the 

congressional report, one of the things we're concerned 

about with the statute is that it could capture people 

who are expressing salacious thoughts.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or just good honest liars, 

right? I had thought that the purpose of the First 

Amendment was to protect speech that had some value, and 

that the reason obscenity is excluded entirely from

First Amendment protection is that it has no redeeming 

social value.

 What social value do you find in being able 

to lie about the content of what you're offering to 

somebody else? You say somehow if you're lying about 

it, oh, well, then the First Amendment protects that. I 

would think if you're lying about it, it is clearer than 

ever the First Amendment doesn't protect it. There is 

no social value in protecting lies.

 MR. DIAZ: One of the problems with the 

issue of social value and lying is that we don't put 

people in jail for 5 mandatory minimum years or 20 years 

in prison for simply lying. We simply don't do that. I 

agree with Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it depends on what 

they're lying about. If they're lying about the value 

of what they're selling, you know, it's fraud.

 MR. DIAZ: And I agree with Your Honor --

Justice Scalia, that we have a slew of State statutes 

particularly in the area of consumer fraud. If I 

pretend to have something that's illegal and offer it to 

you or promote it to you or advertise it to you, and I 

have nothing, then that person can and should be 

punished, but not for -- not under this statute.

are we protecting here, by protecting the lie about 

whether this thing that really isn't child pornography 

is? What -- why would we want to protect that?

 MR. DIAZ: We necessarily do not want to 

protect that. But we don't punish it with a 5 to 

20-year prison sentence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you complaining about 

the degree of the penalty?

 MR. DIAZ: It is not just the degree of the 

penalty. The statute doesn't just cover liars, Justice 

Scalia. It also covers people who are mistaken. It 

covers exaggeration. It covers puffing.

 For example, if I have a legitimate clean 

videotape that I want to duplicate, I may be violating 

trademark or other patent laws or whatnot, but I want to 

take this and I want to sell it in the marketplace over 

the Internet. And I exaggerate by the words that I 

choose to use in promoting that tape for commercial 

purpose, for example, and I'm exaggerating.

 That person if they market the materials in 

a way that causes the potential buyers to believe that 

what it has is illegal, even if I'm just puffing or 

bragging, the car salesman in a car sales situation, we 

don't like it --

entirely different thing to say that this car is a great 

car and it turns out not to be a great car, and to say 

what you have is either -- is not -- is child 

pornography when, in fact, it's not. Those are two 

different things.

 MR. DIAZ: I think it could be very -- in 

the real world I think it is very easy for a person to 

puff about what materials contain that are lawful to 

possess, such as Titanic, Lolita or American Beauty. 

And all you would have to say is, put a trailer on it 

and say that this is hot graphic teen sex, and you're 

puffing about what it really is. We know -- you know it 

really isn't.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The statute has an 

objective component. To the objective observer, it must 

reasonably cause them to believe that it's actually 

child pornography. So that -- that would be -- that 

would prevent sort of the vague puffery that you're 

talking about from being covered while still covering 

something that satisfies both the subjective and 

objective test.

 MR. DIAZ: Mr. Chief Justice, I think that 

if a person listens to or hears somebody describe 

Titanic, Lolita, American Beauty or any of the films of 

the like as hot graphic teen sex, I think a reasonable

portrayed is proscribed material, even if it doesn't 

exist, or even if it exists and is protected under 

Ferber.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You seem to think we are 

punishing the lying. I don't read the statute as 

punishing the lying.

 MR. DIAZ: No, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You'd be punished even if 

it were true. What is being punished is the pandering. 

You are the one that's bringing in the lying example. 

You say, my goodness, even if the pandering is a lie, 

pandering is pandering. And I don't see why there is 

some special protection against pandering when in 

addition to pandering, you're lying.

 Maybe you ought to get extra penalty.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But, in fact, the statute 

does not provide extra penalty. It just provides a 

penalty for pandering. And I don't know why it's a good 

defense to that to say, oh, I was actually lying. I 

mean --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about "present"? 

The word "pandering" itself is not used in the statute. 

It uses a lot of words, "promote" and "advertise" --

well, maybe that's just redundant. I guess that would 

be the government's position -- but "present," 

"distribute" -- what else?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: All of those verbs only 

become pandering when they are attached to explicit 

sexual material. When you promote explicit sex, you are 

pandering. I mean, the word pandering does have a 

sexual connotation. I -- I think -- I had thought it 

was accepted that we have here a statute that's directed 

against pandering.

 MR. DIAZ: But the problem with the statute, 

while it does capture pandering and illegal conduct, it 

goes beyond that and captures a slew of innocent conduct 

which we discussed this morning in the examples --

JUSTICE ALITO: What would you say is the 

best realistic example that you can provide to show that 

this is overbroad?

 MR. DIAZ: The best and realistic example 

would be any person, not necessarily amazon.com or 

Netflix, it could be a private citizen. It could be a 

religious leader of a religious group, regardless of 

what type of religion we're talking about.

It could be any of those people --

JUSTICE ALITO: Doing -- doing what?

 MR. DIAZ: Who look at the -- the Nan Goldin 

pictures, who look at Lolita, Traffic and all of these 

other movies and harbor a belief that it is obscene, 

which is one of the two types of materials that's 

proscribed.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we did this? What 

would you think about an opinion, and why, which says 

the following? We take every one of those examples and 

all the ones listed here and put them in appendix A, and 

the opinion says this is the Solicitor General's 

interpretation of the statute, as amended, say with the 

word presentment, which comes out of promotion infer, 

and we think under that interpretation of the statute, 

none of these things, nor anything like them, could be 

prosecuted.

 And if so understood, we can find no 

example, at least none not present in Ferber itself, 

where this would be overbroad. Therefore, it is 

constitutional. I'm not saying that is my view. I am 

saying simply I want to know your opinion about what 

would be wrong with such an opinion.

 MR. DIAZ: My opinion, Justice Breyer, is 

that could be done. We could put a dozen or two dozen

or three dozen, an exponential number of examples, that 

would be excluded. Essentially we would be writing an 

affirmative defense into the statute or an absolute 

defense that would prohibit even the prosecution. The 

concern that that raises for me, in answer to Your 

Honor's question, is you're still going to have a 

chilling on free speech. There are still going to be 

people out there who are not covered by one of these 

examples who we haven't thought of, and that person is 

going to be afraid to express opinions.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose if we were 

going to do that it would be simpler and maybe prudent 

for us to reexamine our overbreadth rule. Your client 

here falls within none of these examples. He was 

convicted of having what everyone recognizes as not only 

child pornography but involving a very small child. And 

he knew what it was. And he -- and he conveyed that 

belief.

 Given the fact that it would appear that 

child pornography is a growing problem, a serious 

problem on the Internet, maybe we should examine the 

overbreadth rule and just say that your client cannot 

make this challenge.

 MR. DIAZ: The Court can certainly do that, 

Justice Kennedy. Essentially, though, I think what the

Court would be doing would be taking the four areas of 

speech that have been taken out of the First Amendment 

protection, which is defamation, the fighting words 

under Brandenburg, Miller, which is obscenity, and the 

additional extension of Ferber. Now what we would be 

doing is carving yet another area of speech out of the 

First Amendment, and we're just going to continue 

chipping it away and chipping it away.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. I don't think 

that is responsive to Justice Kennedy's point. You 

wouldn't be carving it out of the First Amendment. You 

would be saying we're going to treat this area like 

other areas, which would say that whoever is challenging 

it has to show that they're a problematic case.

 In other words, your client is relying -- he 

didn't produce Lolita. You're relying on the effect on 

other people, and that is what our overbreadth doctrine 

allows, if there's a substantial amount of speech that's 

protected. And what I understood the question to 

suggest is that we would wait basically for as-applied 

challenges when Lolita is being prosecuted and we would 

hear from them, but not in your case.

 MR. DIAZ: That certainly could be done, 

Mr. Chief Justice. Again, and as I suggested earlier, 

the problem with that is that we're not talking about

anything less than a criminal statute, a criminal 

statute that implicates the First Amendment, freedom and 

thought which this Court since its very existence has 

said we have to honor and respect, even if people are 

thinking about nasty or dirty things.

 That's what this country is based upon, and 

the grave concern if we're going to do it on an 

as-applied challenge, is people who might be afraid to 

express their views about whether this is or is not 

obscene. It's is the parent of a neighborhood group who 

see a movie and wants to tell everybody about it and 

say, look --

JUSTICE ALITO: Here we have -- we have one 

statute that covers advertising, promoting, presenting, 

distributing, and soliciting. Suppose that all of those 

activities were not lumped together in one statute, and 

there was a separate provision for each, and suppose 

that the Court were to conclude that there is a problem 

with one of them. Let's say promotes or presents.

 Would all of the others fall as well, under 

the overbreadth doctrine, if they were set out in 

separate statutory provisions?

 MR. DIAZ: I believe that that would more 

narrowly tailor the statute, but I don't believe, 

Justice Alito, that it would solve the problem of

chilling speech.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't the problem 

the problem of your answer to Justice Breyer's 

hypothetical. He said, you know, what if we have this 

appendix and we list -- I forget what he said, three 

dozen examples that the Solicitor General says wouldn't 

be covered and that sounds fine to us. Your answer was 

well, there would still be some examples not covered.

 But isn't -- isn't the answer to that that 

there would be some conceivable overbreadth, I suppose, 

no matter what the appendix said? Somewhere out there 

there would be an example not covered that would be the 

basis for an as-applied challenge, but there wouldn't be 

substantial overbreadth. And isn't that the case? That 

if Justice Breyer's hypo were in fact the decision of 

this case, there wouldn't be a fair argument that there 

is any substantial overbreadth left to the statute, 

isn't that so?

 MR. DIAZ: That -- it could be, and that 

would depend. I agree with Your Honor, Justice Souter, 

that we have this world or this universe of overbroad 

speech, and the appendix would shrink it and make it 

narrower.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And rewrite -- and 

essentially rewriting the law, and that's my question

about this technique that Justice Breyer has proposed. 

This Court is not generally in the business of writing 

appendices that say well, the statute couldn't apply in 

this situation, and it couldn't apply and as long as we 

put those contours around it. Certainly the Court could 

write an opinion that would inform Congress why this 

particular statute as written is overbroad, and explain 

what kind of statute wouldn't be overbroad.

 But for the Court itself, I think that 

that -- I don't know any instance in which we have 

provided that kind of appendix that said things that are 

like Traffic, they're okay, and things that are like 

something else are not okay. I don't know.

 MR. DIAZ: With respect, my initial response 

to Justice Breyer's suggestion, if you will, was the 

same as Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg. I don't know that 

creating an appendix of examples is going to cure the 

problem. I do concede that it would lessen the problem. 

We would -- we would --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why would it lessen? I 

assume whatever you put in an appendix, saying all these 

other situations that are not before us are not covered. 

Isn't that the most blatant dictum? But -- but -- and, 

of course, we're not bound in later cases by our dicta. 

But come to think of it, I guess the whole doctrine of

overbreadth rests upon dictum, doesn't it? It -- it 

rests upon our determination in this case, which 

involves somebody who undoubtedly was selling child 

porn, and a horrible kind of child porn -- we say in 

this case, oh, we can -- we can contemplate other cases, 

where we would not hold the person guilty. That is all 

dictum, too, isn't it?

 So I guess the whole doctrine is -- is based 

on dictum. So we may as well put it in all an appendix. 

Let's put our dictum in an appendix. I agree.

 MR. DIAZ: In answer to Your Honor's 

question or comment --

(Laughter.)

 MR. DIAZ: -- the -- I agree that the issue 

of overbreadth is something where we're looking at 

boundaries. And that's really what I think the Court 

does in a situation of overbreadth analysis. You look 

at the boundaries. How much -- how far we've gone 

outside of the boundaries of what is protected.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's the 

boundary between what is -- what should be protected in 

relation to what's unprotected.

 So what's the ratio between legitimate films 

like Lolita and illegitimate child pornography? In 

other words, is, in fact, the protected material

substantial in relation to the law's legitimate sweep?

 MR. DIAZ: The problem is we don't have an 

empirical answer, a mathematic answer to that question. 

What we do know is that films like Lolita, American 

Beauty, and whatnot, which if presented in a certain way 

can bring people under the coverage of the statute, have 

received acclaim around the world, I mean all sorts of 

academy awards. They're seen time and time again. 

They're seen on Netflix. They're seen on cable TV. To 

this day, some of these movies have been around for 30 

years.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, the point of the 

-- the point of the appendix, which unfortunately has 

the failing of many charming metaphors, is that it has 

acquired a life of its own.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: It distracts from the 

question. But it -- as I read the Solicitor General's 

interpretation of the statute, and amended it, taking 

the word "presentment" from its context in Ferber, where 

it was part of the definition of promotion, I thought 

that was the appendix. At least, that's my hypothetical 

question. And so whether you like appendices or don't 

like appendices, you could focus on why isn't it the 

appendix I'm talking about?

He's filled it with qualifications using the 

words "knowingly, reasonable," and a context that if it 

is not purely commercial, as I understood, is at least 

commercial plus a few things such as bartering.

 That was really my question, and you've come 

back to American Beauty and so forth, and if there's one 

thing I think his definition keeps out of this 

discussion, it is American Beauty and Traffic, because I 

don't see under his interpretation how anyone could 

conceivably be prosecuted even if he's talking to a 

group who have never seen a movie. That isn't a 

reasonable group of people. So what is your response to 

what he said?

 MR. DIAZ: My response, Justice Breyer, is 

that if you take the word "present" and you give it the 

meaning that it was given in Ferber, you make the 

statute narrower. You make it -- bring it into more of 

a constitutionally acceptable realm, but I respectfully 

do not believe that it cures the entire problem, and my 

basis for saying that the question of Justice Souter of 

the Solicitor General. You know -- the concern is, when 

you don't have lawyers who understand these 

hypertechnical meanings that the Court is going to give 

and the interpretations we're going to put on them --

that you may still have some overbreadth left, but it's 

not substantial? Most 17 year olds are, in fact, going 

to realize that the real thing is not going on in, you 

know, the Lolita movie. And if we accept that as a 

factual proposition, which was the Solicitor General's 

answer, and if we also accept, not by way of appendix 

but way of rationale in the opinion, that these various 

activities have got to be given an essentially 

commercial or quasi-commercial character, so that they 

don't pick up the conversations with the neighbor, then 

that's simply a matter of statutory interpretation that 

could be part of our rationale. If we accept the 

factual proposition about what reasonable viewers are 

likely to know, and we engage in that kind of 

interpretation following the Solicitor General's view of 

how this serial list of activities should be construed, 

don't we eliminate the possibility -- wouldn't we 

eliminate the possibility of substantial overbreadth? 

Some things may get by. There may still be legitimate 

applied challenges, but substantial overbreadth, would 

that be left?

 MR. DIAZ: I think it would, but concededly 

to a lesser degree, because once you make it clear as to 

what matters are not covered by the statute, it makes it 

easier for people to conform their conduct and their

words accordingly. The concern that I have is that it 

still chills a -- it still chills free speech. If a 

person looks at an appendix or looks at the rationale in 

the Court's opinion in this case --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It can, but can you give me 

an example of a class of activities that would not be, 

in effect, insulated from indictment by these two steps 

in the opinion, that would be of substantial character?

 MR. DIAZ: Certainly, and I go back to the 

question of Justice Breyer which is adolescents, 17 year 

olds, 18 year olds, who like to look at these types of 

materials and one of them could simply say to another 

over the Internet, you know, do you think we can get 

some hardcore child porn? He's soliciting child porn 

from another person, and that individual, that 17 year 

old kid, who's fantasizing or experimenting with his own 

sexuality, can go to jail for 5 to 20 years. And we see 

that in everyday America, in high schools around the 

country.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we see them getting 

prosecuted in any state?

 MR. DIAZ: If he's soliciting materials 

under sub (i) or sub (ii) of the statute, of the 

pandering provision of the statute, yes. That person 

can be prohibited. Excuse me, that person can be

prosecuted.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I asked you have there 

been such cases? A lot of states have pandering laws 

now, and is the case that you posit a case that has 

occurred in any of those states?

 MR. DIAZ: Your Honor, I cannot cite a 

specific example, but I can certainly tell Your Honor 

this -- prosecutions from 1997 to 2004 have increased 

over 452 percent. The conviction rate --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe that's because the 

quantity of material has increased.

 MR. DIAZ: Exactly. And the conviction rate 

is 99.6 percent. And --

JUSTICE ALITO: And if one person says to 

another, can we get some child pornography, how is that 

solicitation?

 MR. DIAZ: "Can you get me."

 JUSTICE ALITO: Oh, "can you get me."

 MR. DIAZ: "Can you get me."

 JUSTICE ALITO: And you think that's 

protected by the First Amendment? Asking someone for 

child pornography is protected?

 MR. DIAZ: First of all, it may not be 

protected by the First Amendment, but it shouldn't be 

captured by this statute, which puts that 17 year old in

jail for 5 to 20 years.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The only thing that 

limits the statute is the First Amendment. What else --

you say it may not be covered by the First Amendment. 

What else gives you a right to challenge the statute?

 MR. DIAZ: I don't think that it is 

necessarily not covered by the First Amendment. I think 

certainly the First Amendment -- and this Court has 

held, that we protect salacious thoughts, salacious 

ideas.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But it's not thought at that 

point. It's a request to obtain contraband, which fuels 

the production of the contraband. Is it protected by 

the First Amendment or not, soliciting child 

pornography?

 MR. DIAZ: I think the First Amendment is 

implied, but I don't think it becomes criminal conduct 

until you get to either an attempt, solicitation, or a 

conspiracy. You have to do more than just say I would 

like to get it or can you get it for me, to be guilty of 

the statute.

 JUSTICE ALITO: To fall -- to fall under the 

statute or to be protected by the First Amendment or not 

protected by the First Amendment?

JUSTICE ALITO: Which is it?

 MR. DIAZ: To fall within the protection of 

the First Amendment. And another example that comes to 

mind is a person has material which they believe is 

child pornography. They give it to somebody else, such 

as Lolita, for an opinion and they present to it that 

person. One of the biggest problems or one of the 

biggest -- the verb that's most objectionable in the 

statute is "present," because it does not have to have 

any commercial requirement.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I mean the model penal code 

has a general prohibition of soliciting illegal 

activities. Are you saying that that's -- that 

provision violates the First Amendment? Because it's 

just words?

 MR. DIAZ: Solicitation is a crime in and of 

itself, and talking about or expressing a desire to 

obtain is not -- doesn't quite go to the level of 

solicitation or intent, where there has to be a 

proximity in time, in immediacy, and a certain 

geographical proximity between the words and the comment 

that you intend.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But I thought the word in 

the statute is "solicit."

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice.

 Overbreadth, as this court has reminded us 

any number of times, is strong medicine, and that is 

why, even in the First Amendment context, as-applied 

challenges remain the basic building blocks of 

adjudication. Rejection of this overbreadth challenge 

here does not mean that the courts will not be open to 

here as-applied challenges going forward. Of course, 

the Respondent here has no claim that the statute is 

unconstitutional as applied to him.

how we could do that.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think you could, 

Justice Kennedy. You could -- I mean the burden here is 

on the challenger who doesn't say that the statute's 

unconstitutional as-applied to them to show substantial 

overbreadth in absolute terms and relative to the 

statute's legitimate sweep. And it's interesting that 

neither Respondent nor the court of appeals ever engaged 

in that latter inquiry. And that's a critical inquiry.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How is it different it 

would be strange to trust out the document -- the 

doctrine as I -- as I understand it is what we relied on 

when we had the predecessor to this statute before.

 GENERAL CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg I'm not 

urging that you get rid of overbreadth doctrine once and 

for all -- probably be in the government's interest. I 

am simply saying that if you apply overbreadth analyses, 

the way it supposed to be applied it's not satisfied 

here. It's not just enough for you to envision a couple 

of hypotheticals. It has to be the overbreadth has to 

be substantial relative to the legitimate sweep of the 

statute. This Court in Virginia against Hicks said 

faulted the lower court opinion because it had no 

analyses whatsoever of valid versus invalid 

applications. The proportionality aspect of this courts

overbreadth jurisprudence was ignored entirely. That 

could be verbatim the holding of this case. The 11 

circuit did engage in that relative analysis. When my 

brother was asked for empirical evidence about the 

comparison he said he didn't have any. With all due 

respect, I think that's fatal to his case.
