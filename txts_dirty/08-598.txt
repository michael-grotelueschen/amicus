 (11:02 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Bobby versus Bies. Mr. Mizer.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN C. MIZER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MIZER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Three separate lines of double jeopardy 

analysis lead independently to the conclusion that the 

Double Jeopardy Clause commits the Ohio postconviction 

court to hold a hearing to determine whether Mr. Bies is 

mentally retarded for purposes of Atkins.

 First, there has been no acquittal in this 

case. Second, there is no successive jeopardy; and, 

third, even if collateral estoppel analysis applies 

under Ashe versus Swenson, the Atkins issue has not 

actually and necessarily been decided. Each of these 

factors shows that the Ohio court's decision to go 

forward with the Atkins hearing was reasonable, and this 

Court therefore should, consistent with AEDPA, give the 

Ohio courts their first chance to adjudicate Mr. Bies's 

Atkins claim.

 Much of the dispute in this case centers on 

the parties' disagreement over the meaning of Ashe

versus Swenson and its application. But Mr. Bies cannot 

benefit from Ashe because Ashe -- the Ashe collateral 

estoppel rule only operates to benefit defendants who 

have in hand an earlier acquittal, and Mr. Bies has 

never been acquitted of the death penalty in any sense 

of the word.

 This Court, beginning in Bullington and 

extending through Sattazahn, has defined an "acquittal" 

in a death penalty context as a finding by the sentencer 

that the death -- that the sentence of death is 

warranted in a particular case. And the -- the jury and 

the trial judge in this case agreed that death was 

warranted, and, in fact, the Ohio Supreme Court and 

every reviewing court has agreed that death was 

warranted.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they all agreed that 

he was mentally retarded, and that was a mitigator. 

They all agreed to that. But assuming you're right on 

issue preclusion, what more -- the State says, yes, we 

recognize "mental retardation" means you can't 

administer the death penalty. But what would the State 

show at an Atkins hearing that is not already in the 

record of this case? I mean why do it again?

 MR. MIZER: The reason to do it again, Your 

Honor, is because the -- the standard set forth by the

Ohio Supreme Court in Lott when it was implementing this 

Court's decision in Atkins contained three definitions 

-- three elements of the Atkins definition, of the 

definition of "mental retardation." And those three 

elements were not carefully demonstrated by Dr. Winter. 

And, in fact, the -- the record here -- the Ohio 

post-conviction court has concluded -- doesn't suffice 

to make the post-Atkins Lott determination.

 The -- at pages 101a to 104a of the Petition 

Appendix, the State postconviction court looks at all 

the evidence, including Dr. Winter's testimony, and says 

that there needs to be a hearing where experts will be 

called in order to determine whether Mr. Bies not only 

suffers from significant intellectual limitations, which 

includes IQ, but there is conflicting IQ evidence in the 

record. It also includes findings that he suffers from 

substantial limitations in adaptive skills, the skills 

needed for daily life, which Dr. Winter never 

specifically spoke about. She spoke only about IQ when 

she was talking about mental retardation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't want to take you 

too far outside the record, and you can come back to it, 

but I -- I just have this question. Suppose that in a 

jury case the jury -- pre-Atkins, the jury says, we find 

that the defendant has a 65 IQ, but that in light of the

heinous nature of the offense, this is not a mitigating 

factor, and that he should be sentenced to death.

 In a subsequent Atkins proceeding, can the 

jury finding with reference to the IQ be conclusive?

 MR. MIZER: No, it cannot.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or must that be reopened?

 MR. MIZER: It can, Your Honor, for two 

reasons.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It can -- can be reopened?

 MR. MIZER: It can be. Yes, I'm sorry. It 

can't be preclusive. It can be reopened for two 

reasons, one relating to the definition of "mental 

retardation" post-Atkins and the other relating to the 

different issues.

 First, with respect to the definition, the 

Ohio Supreme Court has made clear in Lott that IQ is not 

enough to determine mental retardation. In fact, the --

the clinicians and the American Association of Mental 

Retardation say that IQ is not enough, particularly in a 

borderline case where IQ is close to the line. And 

there you need to look very carefully at adaptive 

skills. Moreover --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But could the -- could the 

defendant argue the -- that -- the accused argue that at 

least as to the finding of the 65 IQ, that that is a

given.

 MR. MIZER: And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that that issue, i.e., 

the level of IQ, cannot be relitigated, the number?

 MR. MIZER: And the answer to that is no, 

Your Honor, for issue preclusive purposes, because the 

issue is completely different in the mitigation context 

from the post-Atkins context. And I think that 

difference is highlighted by the difference between 

Penry and Atkins. Pre-Atkins what the sentencer was 

talking about, the jury and then the Ohio Supreme Court 

when it affirmed, was what this Court told it to talk 

about in Penry.

 It was talking about mental retardation as a 

mitigating factor, and the State of Ohio and the Ohio 

courts had to know the definition of "mental 

retardation" pre-Atkins. In fact, I think if there had 

been a definition and if the courts had excluded 

evidence from the jury that didn't rise to a certain 

level of severity, then we would have run into a -- a 

post -- a Penry and Tennard problem. And so all of the 

evidence was allowed in, and it was treated as 

mitigating.

 And so what the Ohio Supreme Court was doing 

was what Penry told it to do: Considering mitigating

evidence of mental retardation. But post-Atkins the 

inquiries are different, because Atkins effectively 

constitutionalized a clinical judgment in making -- in 

defining a categorical bar on executing the mentally 

retarded.

 And so post-Atkins it is necessary to be 

very careful about the clinical judgment, and this 

record does not suffice for that clinical judgment. And 

I think it -- think it does not behoove either party to 

suggest that the record --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, when you say "the 

clinical judgment," you mean the specific finding of a 

65 IQ?

 MR. MIZER: The -- the clinical judgment 

that I refer to, Your Honor, is that required by -- by 

Lott. It looks not only at IQ, but also at the adaptive 

skills limitation.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. I grant you that 

under -- under the earlier case the 65 IQ was not 

dispositive, and I mean that was the -- the case in 

Justice Kennedy's hypothetical. But it was necessary 

under the early case to come to a determination of what 

the IQ was, even though that determination was not 

dispositive of the result. And because it was necessary 

to come to a determination, why shouldn't there be a

preclusion?

 MR. MIZER: Because, Your Honor, I think 

there are two different meanings of "necessary." It was 

-- it was necessary in the sense that it had to be done, 

but it wasn't necessary in the issue preclusive offense 

because it -- it was --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It wasn't necessary to 

reach that particular -- in other words, the 

determination of 65 was not necessary to reach the 

conclusion that they reached.

 MR. MIZER: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And you -- you are saying 

the very fact that it was not dispositive of the result 

means that it cannot be preclusive now?

 MR. MIZER: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. MIZER: And -- and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask how it worked 

pre-Atkins when mental retardation was a mitigator? We 

are told that the appellate courts independently 

reviewed. We have a finding at the trial level that, 

yes, there is a mitigator mental retardation, but it 

doesn't overcome the aggravator, so the jury comes in 

with a death sentence.

 Then at the appellate level, is there a

continuing adversary contest about whether retardation 

exists and, therefore, is a mitigator, or is it just the 

-- the judge, the appellate judge, looking over the 

record that has been made at trial?

 MR. MIZER: The -- the appellate courts 

engaged in a de novo record and new -- new evidence 

doesn't come into the record on direct review. But 

there is still argument -- the parties are still in an 

adversarial posture.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so that the 

prosecutor could still argue that was unreasonable for 

them to find mental retardation, so there shouldn't be 

that mitigator?

 MR. MIZER: That's correct, Your Honor, but 

there wasn't at the time a -- a great deal of incentive 

to litigate that question because the Ohio Supreme Court 

had said that mental retardation only merited some 

weight in mitigation. And, in fact, the -- the 

appellate briefs on direct review are in the Joint 

Appendix and -- excerpts of those briefs. And Mr. Bies 

himself on direct review didn't vigorously argue his 

mental retardation evidence. In fact, he said that the, 

"arguably," in his words, "the most persuasive 

mitigating evidence" was his lack of a prior record and 

his lack of prior violent history.

And so none of the parties thought that 

mental retardation in 1992 through 1996 was very 

persuasive, because the courts didn't treat it and the 

jury didn't treat it as very persuasive, Perhaps for the 

reasons that this Court underscored in Atkins, where the 

Court said that, as it had said in Penry, that mental 

retardation evidence presented to a jury in mitigation 

could be a two-edged sword, because some jurors might 

perceive and the prosecutor might argue that that 

evidence went to future dangerousness, and therefore the 

-- the State of Ohio argued that the mental retardation 

evidence here was simply not persuasive and it was 

outweighed by the -- the aggravating factors that the 

jury had found. Atkins told the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I interrupt right 

there, Mr. Mizer? Is it fair to interpret the jury's 

decision to impose the death penalty as having found 

that he was not mentally retarded and therefore was not 

a mitigating factor, or that even though he was -- a 

mitigating factor, the aggravating factors outweighed 

that factor?

 MR. MIZER: I think, Your Honor, that it's 

fairest and the record that's easiest to go by is what 

the Ohio Supreme Court said, because the jury didn't 

make any specific remarks about mental retardation as a

mitigator; the Ohio Supreme Court did.

 But the -- the jury's verdict and then the 

Ohio Supreme Court's affirmance should best be read as a 

determination that the aggravating factors outweigh the 

mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and that 

mental retardation was one of those mitigating factors. 

But it should not be read as a mini-verdict on the 

existence of or the question of whether Mr. Bies is 

mentally retarded. Because --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If they didn't make a 

finding on mental retardation, how -- how could the 

appellate court determine that it was a mitigator but 

overwhelmed by the aggravating -- what did the judge 

charge the jury about mitigators and aggravators?

 MR. MIZER: The judge charged the jury that 

-- first of all, Your Honor, the mitigating evidence 

introduced by Mr. Bies was not extensive. He -- he 

introduced an unsworn statement by himself and then Dr. 

Winter testified, and that was the extent of the case in 

mitigation. So the jury was charged with the various 

statutory mitigating factors in Ohio, which is found in 

Ohio Revised Code 2929.04.

 The mental retardation evidence was relevant 

under two of those mitigating statutory factors, one, 

factor 3, which went to mental disease or defect, and

then the catch-all, factor 7. But the -- but I think 

Poland helps to illuminate what the -- not only what the 

jury was doing, but also what the Ohio Supreme Court was 

doing when it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: First go back to the 

jury. How do we know that the jury found mental 

retardation as a mitigator?

 MR. MIZER: We don't, Your Honor. All that 

we know is that the jury determined that the aggravating 

factors outweighed the mitigators beyond a reasonable 

doubt. What we do know and what the Sixth Circuit hung 

its hat on was the statement by the Ohio Supreme Court 

on direct review that Mr. Bies's mental retardation 

merits weight in mitigation.

 Poland explains that that -- that statement 

by the Ohio Supreme Court should not be treated as a 

mini-verdict on the mitigating factor, but instead it 

should be read as an Eighth Amendment-required marking 

of the guidepost, the very guidepost that this Court in 

Penry said must be marked, the relevance of mitigating 

evidence of mental retardation.

 But -- but Poland says it's wrong to think 

of that marking of that Eighth Amendment guidepost as a 

mini-verdict on mental retardation, and instead it 

should just be thought of as one of the factors that was

bounding the discretion of the sentencer. And so Poland 

instructs that Mr. Bies and the Sixth Circuit are wrong 

to think of mental retardation as actually having been 

found in some sense that affords preclusive effect, 

because instead it was just an Eighth Amendment 

balancing.

 And instead what Atkins tells us is that the 

State of Ohio, just as the States were given the 

opportunity after Ford v. Wainwright in the insanity 

context, should be given the opportunity for the very 

first time in this case to implement Atkins to 

determine, given clinical expert judgment, whether or 

not Mr. Bies is in fact mentally retarded under the 

three-part --

JUSTICE BREYER: I understand the argument 

that the issues are not quite the same, that the Atkins 

issue of mental retardation is not quite the same as the 

issue that was litigated. Let's try and get that out of 

the case. I think that's where Justice Kennedy was 

going.

 Suppose it was a gun case and the Supreme 

Court originally thought you could convict people who 

sell drugs of simple possession of a gun. There's a 

finding, because it's a bench trial, that he simply 

possessed but did not otherwise use the gun. Then the

Supreme Court holds that that isn't enough under the 

statute. So now the State wants to argue, because the 

proceeding on appeal or whatever is still going on, we 

want a second shot at this; we want to show he did more 

than simply possess. Is the State bound by what it 

previously lost on or can the State -- can he get a 

second shot?

 MR. MIZER: The answer is that the State is 

not bound, for two reasons, the first relating to issue 

preclusion and the second relating to the double 

jeopardy doctrine in Ashe. On issue preclusion, the --

the finding with respect to the gun doesn't carry 

preclusive effect because this Court said in --

Sunnen and other cases that when there is a change in 

legal consequences, that change is enough to prevent the 

operation of preclusive rules.

 But on the double jeopardy doctrine --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not -- I'm not going to 

go into double jeopardy. I don't think necessarily that 

it's double jeopardy that -- that is relevant here. But 

I have a -- have you run into this in a different 

context? They wouldn't use the word "double jeopardy." 

It would be some kind of due process problem. Maybe 

there isn't a problem. Have you run in your research to 

anything like what I described?

MR. MIZER: No, Your Honor, because it is 

important to remember that this is -- this is a double 

jeopardy case because of Ashe, and because this is in 

Federal habeas.

 With respect to your question about due 

process or -- or other rules aside from due process, 

it's possible that the State could have more expansive 

common law or State law interpretations of the 

collateral estoppel rules, and maybe those would benefit 

the defendant. This Court in -- in the Hoag case 

declined to use due process to incorporate collateral 

estoppel rules constitutionally. So in your case the 

defendant would only be left with the hope that the 

State would have more expansive collateral estoppel 

rules.

 But to return to Ashe, the defendant here is 

claiming that he is entitled to a constitutionalized 

version of collateral estoppel because of Ashe, but he's 

not entitled to that protection because Ashe applies 

only where a defendant has previously been acquitted, 

and he has not.

 It also applies only in a case where the 

defendant is facing a successive jeopardy of some sort. 

Now, Mr. Bies's sentence is -- is surely at issue in 

this case, but it's at issue in the sense that it would

be at issue in, say, a direct appeal. It's only --

there has only been one prosecution. The State has only 

taken one crack at convicting him or imposing a 

sentence, and that one sentence is what's at issue here.

 And so there is not anything successive 

about this case, and so the Double Jeopardy Clause, 

either through the put-in-jeopardy text or through the 

acquittal requirement, simply has nothing to offer Mr. 

Bies in the way of assistance.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you about --

about exhaustion? What should we do about exhaustion 

here? I take it you don't -- you're not waiving 

exhaustion?

 MR. MIZER: Your Honor, we're not contending 

that the Ashe claim is unexhausted. We agree that 

that's exhausted because in the Ohio courts it is not 

permissible to take an interlocutory appeal when a 

double jeopardy claim has been denied, as it was in this 

case.

 And so we are fine with the Sixth Circuit 

precedent that holds that in that case the Federal 

courts can act in habeas to prevent exposure to a double 

jeopardy. We simply maintain that there is no second 

jeopardy here. But the Atkins claim itself is 

unexhausted, and the Federal magistrate that first dealt

with this case in Federal Court held that it was 

unexhausted. And so now this case needs to go back down 

to the Ohio postconviction court, for what that court to 

do what it was about to do, which is to hold an Atkins 

hearing for the very first time in this case.

 If there are no further questions, I'll 

reserve the balance of my time.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let me just ask, 

does the State have any position now as to his IQ?

 MR. MIZER: No, Your Honor. The Ohio 

postconviction court said at pages 101 to 104a of the 

Petition Appendix that the IQ remains in question. Dr. 

Winters testified at trial that it was 68 or 69; she 

wasn't perfectly consistent. But other record evidence 

introduced later on postconviction proceedings is not 

consistent with that, and so that still needs to be 

definitively --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Wasn't there some 

testimony that one test was only 50?

 MR. MIZER: That evidence is in the JA, and 

it was introduced after -- after the Ohio Supreme Court 

had issued the decision at issue in this case. So that 

evidence is in the record, but it is not part of the 

Ohio Supreme Court's finding. It was introduced on 

postconviction review. So it needs to be considered by

goes back to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Will the State -- would 

you say the State has an independent obligation to -- to 

ensure itself that he has an adequate IQ?

 MR. MIZER: Absolutely, Your Honor, in order 

to be constitutionally consistent with -- with Atkins. 

But that would be borne out through the -- the 

adversarial process in the Atkins hearing that hasn't 

occurred yet.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. BLUME

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. BLUME: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please 

the Court:

 Much of the discussion so far has focused on 

issues which did not form the basis of the panel's 

decision. The panel decided this case under 2254(d)(2). 

And what the panel determined was that the State court's 

decision that Dr. Winter, who was the testifying 

psychiatrist, did not apply the clinical definition of 

mental retardation in forming her opinions and rendering 

her conclusions was an unreasonable determination of the 

facts in light of the evidence presented in the State

court proceeding.

 And it was on that basis the court went 

through the evidence and determined that, in fact, 

Dr. Winter had used the clinical definition of mental 

retardation in rendering her opinion, and that that 

meant that the Ohio Court of Appeals and the Ohio 

Supreme Court made a finding of mental retardation based 

on the clinical -- the clinical definition of mental 

retardation.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But even -- even if that's 

so, that's not necessarily an -- an Atkins finding, 

isn't that correct?

 MR. BLUME: No, I think it is. It's not as 

if there's something --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Atkin -- Atkin -- we didn't 

determine what the definition of retardation was. We --

we operated in Atkins on a broad conception of 

retardation and we came down with a general rule. But 

we left it for later litigation, starting in the States, 

to determine exactly how that line ought to be drawn.

 We didn't know where the line ought to be 

drawn at that point and certainly the clinical 

psychologists didn't know, regardless of what the --

what definition was being used.

 MR. BLUME: Pardon me?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- wasn't the Ohio 

Supreme Court decision in this case pre-Atkins?

 MR. BLUME: Yes, it was. But the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it was dealing with 

retardation as a mitigator, not retardation as 

conclusive that there can be no death penalty.

 MR. BLUME: That's true, but the -- the 

important point, I think, that formed the basis of the 

Sixth Circuit opinion was that in Lott versus -- which 

is the Ohio decision post-Atkins, in Lott they said 

we're embracing the clinical definition of mental 

retardation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But before you get to 

whether -- anything like that, you are urging issue 

preclusion against the winner. It was a death sentence 

in this case. And I am not aware of issue preclusion 

operating against a judgment winner. Issue preclusion 

is for the party who fought this out and won.

 Here we have a death sentence. So there --

the ultimate determination, whatever intermediate 

determinations might have been made on the way, like 

mental retardation exists and was a mitigator, the 

ultimate judgment is death. And I am not aware of, in

all of issue preclusion, where a judgment winner is 

precluded.

 MR. BLUME: Well, clearly that is the more 

typical procedural context, and it happens normally in 

the criminal context of someone that's been acquitted. 

But the procedural posture here is unique, because what 

you have is a prior finding of mental retardation 

pre-Atkins, and clearly, at least according to the 

panel, using the definition of mental retardation which 

is now in effect in Ohio.

 Then subsequent to that you had this Court's 

decision in Ohio -- I mean this Court's decision in 

Atkins, which creates a retroactive new rule which says 

that people with mental retardation can't be executed. 

The essence of a retroactive new rule is that it 

attaches new legal consequences to prior conduct.

 So it is both the rule of Ashe, which says 

when an issue has been determined in a final proceeding, 

combined with this Court's decision in Atkins placing a 

category of people --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is what 

is the issue, and an intermediate finding, say 

mitigation, on the way to the ultimate conclusion, life 

or death, is not the same issue as if retardation is 

found, no death penalty. It's -- it's the ultimate

issue in the case that was before the Ohio Supreme Court 

is, do the aggravators outweigh the mitigators? That's 

the ultimate determination, and that's what would have 

preclusive effect, not the many intermediate findings 

that may have been made on the way to the ultimate 

determination of death.

 MR. BLUME: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think 

that minimizes or does not give adequate significance to 

what the Ohio Supreme Court describes as its role in --

on the appellate review. And they describe their role 

as being that they engage in an independent reweighing 

of the mitigation against the aggravation. A first step 

of that is the identification of the mitigating 

circumstances.

 So they have taken it upon themselves to 

identify the mitigating circumstances, and they have to 

do that by a preponderance of the evidence, which is the 

same standard which exists now in a Lott proceeding.

 In the course of reviewing Mr. Bies's 

sentence on appeal, intermediate appeal of the court of 

appeals, and then the Ohio Supreme Court, both courts 

found that Mr. Bies had mental retardation. It's not 

also -- I mean, they have described this as an essential 

function of their role, and they also don't do it 

uncritically.

There are other cases, State v. White for 

example, in which they made an express finding that the 

individual had not proven his mental retardation.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: In -- in response to 

Justice Ginsburg's question, I don't see why it makes 

any difference which court is doing what. She -- she 

raised two objections. Number one is that so far as the 

issue being determined in the prior proceeding, the 

characterization of his mental state as retardation was 

at most a subsidiary, not an ultimate fact.

 Number two, the conclusion of that prior 

proceeding was that he lost. And she's saying in those, 

in either of those circumstances, the subsidiary finding 

is not preclusive and any finding is not preclusive in 

the manner in which he wishes to use it here.

 I don't see what difference it makes whether 

we're talking about court A or court B. What is -- what 

is your response to those two objections?

 MR. BLUME: Well, on the first point, I 

didn't mean that it necessarily matters which court it 

did. I was saying that -- trying to describe -- usually 

the necessary part, which is in some ways what we're 

talking about here, was it necessary, turns on two 

considerations. And the necessary -- it's designed to 

determine, as I understand it, one, was the issue

decided; and, two, was it decided with some care for its 

significance to the proceeding?

 And I think, given the unique way in which 

Ohio does the sentence review, both of those concerns 

are satisfied. As for --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If -- if the Ohio court had 

found, the court of first instance had found, that the 

IQ was at some different level, it could have come out 

exactly the same way it came out in this case, couldn't 

it?

 MR. BLUME: Yes, it could have.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So the finding was not 

necessary to the result?

 MR. BLUME: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, we went through 

this with your brother, and he pointed out, yes, it was 

necessary to -- to consider the issue and to make some 

kind of a finding -- I don't know how precise it had to 

be -- but the finding that it made, the -- the actual 

number that was used or the characterization that was 

used to describe that number was not necessary in order, 

in fact, to impose the death penalty.

 MR. BLUME: Well, I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and the sense of 

necessity which is used normally in -- in this kind of

preclusion analysis just doesn't apply here.

 MR. BLUME: Well, that is not my reading of 

the necessary cases. I read that the function that the 

necessary prong serves as trying to serve two goals. 

Number one, was the issue, the question, the issue --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you say you 

have -- you don't find that in the cases when you said 

to me, and I think frankly you were right, that issue 

preclusion -- and there are many, many cases on issue 

preclusion -- is something that a judgment winner uses, 

not a judgment loser, and here the Ohio -- yes, they 

weighed and they found retardation, but they also found 

overwhelmed by the aggravating circumstances. So the 

ultimate determination of that, of all the courts, is 

death?

 I don't see how you get to elevate an 

intermediate determination -- there are many; some go 

for one party, some go for the other -- to become the 

outcome determinative factor. The outcome determinative 

factor is that the aggregators outweighed whatever 

mitigators there were.

 MR. BLUME: Well, I mean -- again, that is 

not my understanding of the role the necessary clause 

plays.

 But now, on to the winner point. So if

that's necessary -- I don't think there's anything in 

Ashe v. Swenson that says you have to win on the 

ultimate outcome. It's do you win on the fact. If 

that's right -- and let's imagine --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Ashe is about 

somebody who was acquitted. He won. There was no doubt 

that he won.

 MR. BLUME: I understand.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It didn't say anything 

about, well, suppose he didn't win.

 MR. BLUME: But the Ashe rule is stated in 

terms of when an issue of fact has been determined in a 

defendant's favor it's binding in any subsequent 

litigation.

 But if the Warden is right -- and let's 

imagine now Mr. Bies goes back for his mental 

retardation hearing, and the court says: Yes, Mr. Bies 

is mentally retarded; on the other hand, I think Atkins 

was wrongly decided.

 It goes up on appeal to the Ohio Supreme 

Court and they say: Yes, Mr. Bies is mentally retarded, 

but we think Atkins was wrongly decided. The case comes 

to this Court, and you summarily reverse and say Atkins 

is still the law of the land.

 Now it goes back, and the Warden could then

say: Well, now that we know you're serious about 

Atkins, we want to reopen the judgment and we want 

another shot --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's not reopen -- it's --

it's the same problem. And maybe you found some 

authority to the contrary, other than statements, but 

actual authority. The defendant loses. He appeals. He 

says they made a mistake. And the normal remedy is you 

give him a new trial. Does it matter that it's a 

collateral proceeding? I don't think so. They go to 

the Federal court: Judge, they made a mistake at my 

trial. You give him a new trial. Everything's up for 

grabs normally at the new trial. I can't think of an 

instance where it isn't.

 Here, they are saying: Judge, they made a 

mistake. They should have applied the mental 

retardation rule of Atkins. So give him a new trial.

 Now, what I'm looking for is just one 

example somewhere that supports you --

MR. BLUME: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- that didn't proceed on 

the theory I've just announced or just said.

 MR. BLUME: I think what you have are the

legal equivalent of insufficient evidence on appeal. 

Now, that's not technically an acquittal, but it's 

treated as an acquittal. But what you have here is a 

finding of fact combined with a later decision on the --

establishing a retroactive new rule, moving people 

outside --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How far -- how far 

down do you go on applying the issue preclusion? Let's 

say there's a ruling by the court that a particular 

expert was not credible. I mean, is that binding in a 

subsequent proceeding?

 MR. BLUME: No, Mr. Chief Justice. I think 

it would have to do one of two things. It would either 

have to absolve the criminal defendant of liability, 

which is sort of the common rule under Ashe, or it would 

have to render him ineligible for the death penalty, 

though the definition of acquittal used in Sattazahn is 

had there been a finding which -- legally sufficient to 

legally entitle the defendant to a life sentence. And 

it is Mr. Bies's position that the finding of mental

retardation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's 

narrowing it to your particular context. I would have 

assumed that the theory has to be more generally 

applicable, and not just applicable in the particular 

Atkins context. If you can have issue preclusion with 

respect to an underlying factual question under which 

the loser can assert that, I don't see why it wouldn't 

apply more generally. That's a theory of the Double 

Jeopardy Clause, not of Atkins.

 MR. BLUME: Well, it's a theory of 

collateral estoppel which is based in the Double 

Jeopardy Clause, which is what -- the issue on which the 

panel resolved this question. And I think that -- as I 

read the collateral estoppel cases, again and even in 

the context of capital sentencing and double jeopardy, 

the finding would have to be either at the -- at the 

criminal liability stage, would it absolve the defendant 

of liability, like in the Ashe context. The finding was 

one of identity. In the first trial, the jury 

acquitted. The only issue was identity. When this 

court looked at the record as a whole -- and then they 

said, okay, you can't subsequently litigate the prior --

the nuts crimes on the issue of identity. In the 

capital sentencing context, at least here, a finding of

mental retardation is a finding sufficient to entitle 

the defendant --

JUSTICE BREYER: Your argument, then --

we're getting somewhere maybe.

 MR. BLUME: Pardon me?

 JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying to me, think 

of Jackson and Denno, If you're in a collateral 

proceeding and the Federal judge said there wasn't 

enough evidence to convict him under the Constitution, 

like the Shuffling Sam case, there isn't enough 

evidence; it isn't that he gets a new trial. The 

Constitution entitles him to acquittal, and therefore 

there is no new trial because of the Double Jeopardy 

Clause, right?

 MR. BLUME: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you're 

saying here, the evidence the first time was such that 

they couldn't give him the death penalty under the 

Constitution as later interpreted. So if that's what 

you discover on the collateral appeal, a similar 

reasoning would somehow lead you to the similar result. 

Is that the argument?

 MR. BLUME: That's more or less the 

argument. And the panel --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But if that is the

argument, then what is being preclusive here is not the 

first judgment. I mean, in preclusion cases it's the 

first judgment that precludes, and we identify a 

judgment which is preclusive in the way we've been 

describing. But in the hypothetical that Justice Breyer 

gave you, there's nothing preclusive about the first 

judgment because the first judgment stands and properly 

can stand. And you're saying there can't be a second 

judgment, but you are not depending upon a rule of 

preclusion that turns on the first. So whatever your 

argument is, it's not -- it's not issue preclusion.

 MR. BLUME: Well, it is the combination of 

the determination that Mr. Bies is a person with mental 

retardation using the same definition according to the 

panel, which is now in effect in the State of Ohio, 

which would apply in a Lott proceeding if he were to 

have it tomorrow.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but you're coming up 

with a brand new rule. Whatever your rule is, it's not 

a rule of double jeopardy and it's not -- it's not the 

traditional rule of issue preclusion.

 MR. BLUME: Well, it is the combination of 

that factual determination with the subsequent rule, a 

retroactive new rule. I mean, it's unusual because 

there are very few retroactive new rules of procedure

which place someone outside --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but what your rule is, 

as I understand it in your response to Justice Breyer's 

question, is if there was a subsidiary fact 

determination in the first case, even though it was 

entirely consistent with the judgment against your 

client, that's subsidiary fact determination can be used 

as a defense by your client in the second case. That's 

your rule, as I understand it, and that is not the rule 

of Ashe v. Swenson and it is not the rule of issue 

preclusion.

 MR. BLUME: It could be used if there is a 

later legal ruling which means the significance of that 

fact would either absolve the criminal defendant of 

liability or make him ineligible for death.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you -- do you agree 

with me that you're asking for a brand-new rule here?

 MR. BLUME: I don't think it is a brand-new 

rule.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: We have never held this, 

and I don't know of any court that's ever held this.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe the unique 

procedural posture is precisely the reason that the rule 

is brand new. If it's unique, we've never had it 

before.

 MR. BLUME: But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: We have the factor that 

you would preclude Ohio from doing, when we expressly 

said that here is the rule: You can't execute the 

mentally retarded. However, we are going to leave it to 

the State to shape the procedure, and what are the 

elements of retardation? You would take all that away 

from Ohio because in a different context, the context of 

weighing mitigators against aggravators, the Ohio 

Supreme Court said there was retardation, it is 

mitigating; however, it was overwhelmed by the 

aggravators.

 It's an entirely different operation than, 

States, here's the rule; the procedure for doing it is 

up to you. Ohio didn't have a procedure for doing 

Atkins. It couldn't until Atkins was decided. And now 

you're saying, oh, Ohio, because you, in the context of 

weighing mitigators against aggravators, found this 

mitigator, you cannot shape the Atkins procedure as

every other State can.

 MR. BLUME: Well, I don't think that's a 

fair determination of what the panel did in this case. 

What the panel said is, number one, that we look at the 

procedure and definition of mental retardation that Ohio 

has adopted. Now, it is the same as the definition of 

mental retardation which was used by Dr. Winter in her 

testimony in Mr. Bies's trial, and is the -- that is the 

sole basis for the determination. And they said the 

burdens of proof are the same. He had the burden of 

establishing this fact of mental retardation by a 

preponderance, and that's the same. So, therefore, on 

that basis, they decided he --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the incentive is 

vastly different, which is an important factor in issue 

preclusion. That is, if the prosecutor thinks that 

there's overwhelming evidence of the aggravators, the 

nature of the crime, the prosecutor is not going to care 

so much about, so there is mental retardation as a 

mitigator; but when it's a difference, when the 

prosecutor wants to go for the death penalty and it 

thinks that it's got a secure case on the atrocious 

matter in which the crime was committed, there isn't the 

same incentive to litigate as there is when it is the 

ultimate question, not an issue on the way to reaching

the ultimate judgment.

 MR. BLUME: Well, I don't think, Justice 

Ginsburg, the incentives have to be identical, but 

certainly prior to Atkins the prosecution had the 

incentive to contest the mental retardation question, 

and in fact in this case the failure to more adequately 

contest it wasn't due to a lack of incentives, it was 

due to a lack of evidence. There were three experts 

that evaluated Mr. Bies, all of whom came to virtually 

identical conclusions. About his mental state.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, this strikes 

me as the sort of case where their incentives might well 

be different, as Justice Ginsburg suggested. If you're 

dealing with a borderline case, you don't -- and you 

think you have very compelling aggravating factors, you 

know, why call attention to the -- the mitigating factor 

of the mental condition when your case can be won on the 

others?

 MR. BLUME: Well, I think for three reasons, 

Mr. Chief Justice. Number one, as this Court recognized 

in Atkins, in cases where there was evidence of mental 

retardation, the jury was much less likely to impose a 

death sentence; that in part was part of the basis of 

this Court's decision in Atkins. Second, on appeal, by 

not contesting the evidence -- the State of Ohio did

contest it here -- you ran the risk that the Ohio Court 

of Appeals or the Ohio Supreme Court would reach a 

different conclusion, number one, on the balance of 

aggravation and mitigation; or, number two, on whether 

the death sentence was disproportion. And the Ohio 

Supreme Court had done that in several other cases.

 But here also, right, you had not only the 

direct appeal and the findings, but you have additional 

findings and concessions in State postconviction, where 

Mr. Bies goes in in State postconviction, and he raises 

a pre-Atkins categorical bar claim, and says I'm a 

person with mental retardation; since this Court's 

decision in Penry, things have changed; and I believe my 

death sentence is disproportionate under the Ohio and 

the United States Constitution.

 In response to that, the State, number one, 

conceded mental retardation and said we agree the record 

reveals Mr. Bies is a person with mental retardation, 

and the postconviction court then enters a finding of 

fact.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did they admit that as a 

finding of fact, or did they say that mental retardation 

had been found as a mitigator by the Ohio Supreme Court?

 MR. BLUME: No, they said the record reveals 

Mr. Bies to be a person with mental retardation, with an

IQ of 69. It is not that there was, we assume for the 

sake of argument, it was nothing like a mitigating. It 

was a finding of fact, now that Mr. Bies was a person --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It was an admission; it 

couldn't have been a finding of fact. You said that 

that's what the State claimed. Where is the admission 

of the State in this State postconviction proceeding 

that Mr. Bies is mentally retarded?

 MR. BLUME: It is in the Joint Appendix at 

153. This is actually the State court order, the 

finding of fact, and it says: Findings of fact. The 

defendant is shown by the record to be mildly mentally 

retarded with an IQ of 69.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You told me that this --

that State conceded that the defendant was mentally 

retarded, and I'm -- that's what I asked you.

 MR. BLUME: I'm sorry, that is both at JA 

143 where -- JA 143 in the State's motion, response for 

judgment: "The record reveals defendant to be mildly 

mentally retarded with an IQ of 69." And that 

concession is repeated in the post conviction appeal at 

page 160 of the Joint Appendix.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What does that have to do 

with issue preclusion? The State can't -- that may 

raise an issue of judicial estoppel. Is that

constitutionally required?

 MR. BLUME: I think it primarily does raise 

a question of judicial estoppel, which we raised, which 

is -- and that is not a technical basis on which to 

grant habeas. It is a reason that the writ should be 

dismissed as improvidently granted.

 There have been multiple concessions after 

that. This was raised by Mr. Bies in his, sort of --

when he asked for estoppel, he asked for it on multiple 

bases. Just as the fact that the warden, the panel 

again decided this under 2254(d)(2) grounds. The warden 

did not raise an issue under 2254(d)(2) in this Court.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But I'm not sure that 

there's even anything -- I mean, it does raise a 

judicial estoppel issue, but I'm not sure there is a --

a record hereupon which a -- a judicial estoppel claim 

could be maintained, because in the passages that you 

referred us to, first the State's concession and 

secondly the finding which -- which followed from it, it 

was a reference to mild mental retardation and a 

specific reference to an IQ of 69.

 I think it's a stretch, would be a stretch, 

to go from saying that a concession of mild mental 

retardation for purposes of mitigation analysis should 

be taken as a concession for dispositive mental

retardation for Atkins purposes. So I -- I have 

difficulty in seeing any clear inconsistency in the 

State's two positions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The very next sentence is 

as a matter of law -- the law as it was then -- such a 

person may be punished by execution. So, again, it's --

the stakes are quite different.

 MR. BLUME: Well, not in regard to this 

particular claim. The claim that we're talking about 

where this concession was made and where this finding 

was made wasn't -- this wasn't the brief on mitigation, 

this was a postconviction challenge to his death 

sentence as a matter of law, saying --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that must have been, 

the page you called my attention to must have been 

pre-Atkins.

 MR. BLUME: It was pre-Atkins, but the claim 

was a pre-Atkins Atkins claim. The claim was not - was 

I am categorically ineligible for the death penalty, and 

I am ineligible because since the Court's decision in 

Atkins, things have changed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, no, we're back --

what you called my attention to was pre-Atkins. It was 

the application made to the State court before Atkins 

which put two sentences together. One was the record

reveals defendant to be mildly mentally regarded with an 

IQ of about 69. As a matter of law, such a person may 

be punished by execution. This is all pre-Atkins.

 So one statement has to be read in the light 

of what was its significance, and it wasn't the 

conclusive factor at the time of that motion.

 MR. BLUME: Well, that was the claim. His 

claim was it violates the Eighth Amendment to excuse 

people with mental retardation. This was not -- this 

was after the direct appeal. He now filed for post 

conviction and he goes in and says, look, I've been sort 

of tracking things since Atkins; States have -- adopt 

new laws.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Since Atkins, we're 

talking about --

MR. BLUME: I'm sorry, since Penry. Since 

Penry there have been new developments, and I believe 

that a new consensus exists, the one that this Court 

subsequently embraced, and it violates the Eighth 

Amendment and the Ohio Constitution to execute persons 

with mental retardation. And it was in response to that 

claim that the State conceded the fact of mental 

retardation, and it was in response to that claim that 

the State court found again Mr. Bies to be a person with 

mental retardation.

That wasn't in some question of the balance 

of aggravating circumstances. That was a straight claim 

that you cannot execute me because I have mental 

retardation.

 And so I was really responding more to 

Justice Souter's questions of judicial estoppel and was 

it the same issue in this, and I think it clearly was at 

that time in this particular context.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Mizer, you have ten minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN C. MIZER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MIZER: First, with respect to the 

judicial estoppel arguments and the State's purported 

concessions, as Justice Ginsburg noted, the statement to 

which Mr. Bies points was pre-Atkins, and Mr. Bies's 

argument ignores that Atkins changed things in two ways: 

one consequential, by enacting, by placing a categorical 

bar on the States; and the second, definitional. So for 

the reasons stated of our -- in our yellow brief at 

pages 16 to 18, the judicial estoppel argument fails for 

all kinds of reasons.

 But more to the point, judicial estoppel 

shouldn't apply here also because the State, whatever it

was saying at the time, was not talking about the 

three-part post-Atkins definition of mental retardation 

in Ohio.

 Mr. Bies also argues that 2254(d)(2) is 

enough to give support to -- to the Sixth Circuit's 

grant of relief -- of relief here, but there are two 

problems with that argument. The first problem is that 

the Sixth Circuit disregarded the reasonable 

determination by the State's postconviction court that 

the Atkins standard had never been applied. The second 

problem is that we shouldn't even get to 2254(d)(2) 

because there are legal problems with the Sixth 

Circuit's reasoning that should have prevented it from 

granting the writ under 2254(d)(1). Mr. Bies argues 

that there is not a legal problem because there was an 

acquittal in this case, because the Ohio Supreme Court's 

statement on direct review that Mr. Bies -- that Mr. 

Bies's mild to borderline mental retardation merits 

weight and mitigation was enough to entitle him to a 

life sentence. But that's not an acquittal, and it's a 

severe distortion of what this Court said in Sattazahn 

about an acquittal.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Mizer, can I just get 

one clarifying question? The concession at page 160 of 

the record, "The record reveals the defendant to be

mildly retarded with an IQ of about 69," and then they 

argue as a matter of law that he cannot be -- he may be 

punished. Is it your position that the further 

proceeding in the Ohio trial court, that the State 

intends to argue that a person who is mentally retarded 

with an IQ of about 69 may be executed?

 MR. MIZER: No, Your Honor, the -- this 

statement will be beside the point, and the question now 

post-Atkins --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So you'll offer evidence 

to show that statement is inaccurate?

 MR. MIZER: The -- the question is, the 

question posed in Atkins doesn't hinge so narrowly on 

IQ. IQ is one of the three elements, and so the experts 

on -- on postconviction review will now determine what 

his IQ is.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand that. The --

could well be different. But is it Ohio's intent to 

disagree with that statement insofar as it recites 

facts? That the record reveals the defendant to be 

mildly mentally retarded with an IQ of about 69? I 

understand you will argue that that's not sufficient to 

-- to come within Atkins. But do you intend to say --

to challenge the accuracy of that factual statement?

postconviction court stated in this case, that -- the

IQ, among all of the other elements of the mental

 If there are no further questions, we would
