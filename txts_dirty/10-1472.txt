Saipan, Limited. 

6  Mr. Fried. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL S. FRIED 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. FRIED: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  Our brief lists six categories of 

12 authorities demonstrating that the work of an 

13 interpreter under 28 U.S.C. section 1920(6) is limited 

14 to spoken communication. Primary among these is the 

Court Interpreters Act itself, whose central provisions 

16 afford simultaneous or consecutive spoken interpreter 

17 services. When the --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I make sure that I 

19 understand the extent of your argument? Are you saying 

that it's interpretation, oral interpretation, just in 

21 the courtroom? 

22  MR. FRIED: Well, Your -- Justice Sotomayor, 

23 I think that it's a -- that there is a textual ambiguity 

24 in the statute about the extent of covered spoken 

interpreter services. One could argue it either way,

1 and we don't -- I am happy to proceed under either 

2 assumption. But what's clear is that, however far it 

3 extends within the area of spoken interpretation, 

4 document translation is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I have to say that 

6 if you read it the way you do, then what you're 

7 suggesting is that for appointed experts, they only get 

8 recompensed for the time they're testifying, because 

9 that's the only time they spend in court. 

MR. FRIED: Court-appointed experts, Your 

11 Honor? 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. 

13  MR. FRIED: I think the -- the legislative 

14 history of that seems to indicate that that provision 

was actually inserted into 1920(6) for a separate 

16 housekeeping reason, because it paralleled Rule 706 of 

17 the Federal Rules of Evidence, which was a pre-existing 

18 rule addressing court-appointed experts, and simply put 

19 it into the enumeration. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But court experts get 

21 a -- get paid for their prep work. 

22  MR. FRIED: Yes, Your Honor. I -- I think 

23 that -- that that may well be the case. But I -- I 

24 think that the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I -- one further

1 question. 

2  MR. FRIED: Of course. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I take all your 

4 arguments, but I read the common dictionary and there's 

no question that the primary meaning of "interpreter" is 

6 interpretation of oral languages. But the dictionary is 

7 broad enough to include translation work as well. 

8  Given that the courts for 70 years have been 

9 awarding -- most of the them except for I think the 

Seventh here. Virtually every court over a 70-year 

11 period has been awarding translation fees as -- as 

12 authorized. Why shouldn't that be enough for us? 

13  MR. FRIED: Well, I --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Meaning, if the 

dictionary term is broad enough and that's what the 

16 courts have been doing and the world hasn't crashed 

17 despite one case where a large amount was given -- your 

18 adversary points to the fact that most of the 

19 translation fees tend to be fairly reasonable. Why 

should we muck with what works? 

21  MR. FRIED: Well, Your Honor, I think 

22 that --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I think I'm drawing --

24 I'm drawing from ways that my colleague next to me 

usually asks a question.

1  (Laughter.) 

2  MR. FRIED: Your Honor, I think that the 

3 primary reason why the Court should -- should not adopt 

4 that is because it's -- it's inconsistent with the text. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's wrong is your answer, 

6 right? 

7  MR. FRIED: Yes, Your Honor. 

8  (Laughter.) 

9  MR. FRIED: And -- and it's also worth 

noting that the courts -- none of the courts of appeals 

11 who have adopted this construction of 1920(6) have 

12 considered or addressed our primary arguments in this 

13 case. They haven't addressed the -- the uniform 

14 professional literature addressing this -- this topic, 

the dictionaries in their aggregate, the Administrative 

16 Office's interpretation of this statute, the consistent 

17 congressional distinction between written translation 

18 and spoken -- spoken interpretation that runs throughout 

19 the code. And --

JUSTICE KAGAN: So, just out of curiosity, 

21 why do you think that all these courts just took for 

22 granted the opposite reading? 

23  MR. FRIED: Well, Your Honor, I'm -- I'm not 

24 sure that I have a -- a good answer to that. I --

perhaps that they weren't presented with some of

1 these -- these arguments and didn't have the opportunity 

2 to consider them. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Perhaps it was 

4 Dr. Johnson's answer when a lady pointed out an error in 

his dictionary, and his answer was: "Stupidity, madam, 

6 sheer stupidity." 

7  (Laughter.) 

8  MR. FRIED: I think -- I think, Your Honor, 

9 that -- that Kan Pacific disputes very little of -- of 

our central argument. Their discussion of --

11  JUSTICE BREYER: There are -- there are lots 

12 of regions of the country -- Puerto Rico, for example --

13 where there are vast numbers of documents that have to 

14 be translated if you go into Federal court, not 

necessarily in the Commonwealth courts. That's 

16 expensive to people. And they might have thought for a 

17 long time, while that expense won't go away, it's at 

18 least better to have it paid by the loser than to have 

19 it paid by the winner. 

That's been the common practice. I don't 

21 think that's a foolish approach. And you can find 

22 language in this, which is to go back -- go back to 

23 Justice Sotomayor. 

24  MR. FRIED: Well, Your Honor, I think 

that -- again, the best reason to reject that view is 

7

1 because it doesn't make a coherent whole of the statute. 

2 These provisions operate together in a uniform set of --

3 as a uniform set of policies for addressing a common 

4 subject. 

And the way they -- these provisions 

6 interact in broad strokes that make perfect sense on our 

7 reading is that in the -- in the primary class of cases 

8 that motivated the passage of this statute, namely cases 

9 brought by the government where there were significant 

constitutional Confrontation Clause concerns about 

11 criminal defendants not understanding the spoken 

12 proceedings, in those core class of cases the Congress 

13 elected to pay for spoken interpreter services directly 

14 in the first instance. 

Now, in the non-core class of cases, private 

16 civil litigation, the Congress elected not to pay for 

17 these services but in 1920(6) to facilitate them in the 

18 lesser manner of providing that a party that incurred 

19 these expenses could recover them at the end of the 

case if it wins. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think of the --

22 I mean, the First Circuit went into this, which deals a 

23 lot with Puerto Rico, and it felt that this fell within 

24 the idea of fees for exemplification, which is 

certifying a document. And, in fact, to certify a

1 document that comes into the Federal court in San Juan, 

2 you have to have it translated very often. And so, the 

3 translation cost is at least consistent with the idea 

4 there of trying to -- well, you may -- you don't have 

to -- you may impose the cost on the loser. 

6  MR. FRIED: Well, Justice Breyer, there was 

7 actually a specific provision in this bill -- in a prior 

8 version of this bill that addressed the context of 

9 Puerto Rico. And the significance of that provision is 

that when the Congress was addressing written 

11 translation, which was part of the -- part of that 

12 provision, it specifically used the word "translation" 

13 to refer to that. 

14  And this just, again, confirms that the --

that the usual congressional practice of differentiating 

16 between these terms in -- in statutes generally was 

17 fully applicable here, that the Congress knew the 

18 difference between these terms, used them appropriately. 

19 And the fact that having removed that -- that provision 

from the statute, the statute as passed contains only 

21 the words "interpreter" and "interpretation," and no 

22 forms of "translate," just again reaffirms that -- that 

23 the ordinary meaning of these terms should apply. 

24 And --

1 that's -- that's read out in open court and it's a 


2 document, a contract, in another language, and the 


3 interpreter -- the witness presents the document, and 


4 the interpreter interprets it? 


MR. FRIED: Your Honor, the professional 

6 literature addresses this as sight interpretation or 

7 sight translation, and it's uniformly recognized to be a 

8 species of interpretation. It occurs -- the -- the 

9 interpreter speaks aloud in the presence of the audience 

being communicated to in the course of a spoken 

11 proceeding. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what if the -- if 

13 the interpreter, being diligent, said I'm going to 

14 have to translate this document in open court, I'd like 

to have it in advance so I can be sure that my 

16 translation is going to be accurate? So that in fact 

17 the interpreter looks at the document and, in -- in 

18 preparation for the trial, translates it. 

19  MR. FRIED: Well, Your Honor, I think that 

the -- the preparatory work that occurred outside of 

21 court would not be compensable interpretation work. But 

22 when the -- when the interpreter returned to court and 

23 gave the oral interpretation of that document, that 

24 would constitute interpretation. But --

1 she's not interpreting it. She's already got the thing 

2 in whatever language they're -- English, I guess. But, 

3 I mean, she's not interpreting; she's reading the 

4 English translation. 

MR. FRIED: That's true, Mr. Chief Justice, 

6 but the key reason why that would constitute 

7 interpretation is because the -- the interpreter is 

8 speaking aloud, communicating in the course of a spoken 

9 conversation to an audience who -- who doesn't speak 

English or who --

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I misunderstood 

12 the hypothetical, then. I'm sorry. 

13  MR. FRIED: Well, perhaps I did, Your Honor. 

14 I apologize. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought it was a 

16 situation where you've got a -- a document in -- in, 

17 say, French and the person translates it or interprets 

18 it -- I don't want to prejudge the issue -- and -- and 

19 then -- in English and then the person reads the English 

thing in -- in court. That's not interpretation at any 

21 point, is it? 

22  MR. FRIED: Well, Your Honor, I think that 

23 the literature does typically class the in-court oral 

24 communication of its content as a form of 

interpretation. But any ambiguity on this point

1 really -- really doesn't -- doesn't affect anything in 

2 practice. I mean, any sight interpretation occurs as a 

3 brief interval in a larger proceeding. 

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is it true that as a 

matter of common usage, when we are talking about oral 

6 testimony in court, we often use "interpretation" and 

7 "translation" or "interpreter" and "translator" somewhat 

8 interchangeably, but when we're talking about rendering 

9 a document into -- into a different language, we 

generally talk about that as "translation"? This is a 

11 matter of common usage. Do you think that's correct? 

12  MR. FRIED: If I understand Your Honor 

13 correctly, yes. I think that the ordinary meaning of 

14 "translate" applies to the context of -- of the 

communication of information in written documents. And 

16 it's discrete from "interpretation," which -- which is 

17 limited to the spoken --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you didn't understand 

19 the question. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That wasn't quite my 

21 point. 

22  MR. FRIED: I'm sorry. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: My point was that I think 

24 we say -- in fact, in a Supreme Court case, we've said 

in the Hernandez case, when we're talking about oral

1 testimony in court, we tend to use "translator" or 


2 "translate" and "interpreter" or "interpret" somewhat 


3 interchangeably. Is that correct? 


4  MR. FRIED: Oh, I apologize, Your Honor. 


Yes, there -- you can use the word "translate" 

6 generically. There's no question. Frequently in court, 

7 and I think out of court as well, that some people can 

8 use the word "translate" in a manner that doesn't 

9 differentiate between modes. Our point is that that --

that double meaning doesn't apply to "interpreter," 

11 which has a single narrow meaning limited to spoken 

12 communication. 

13  And Kan Pacific's discussion of the 

14 dictionaries is limited to a single dictionary, 

Webster's Third. The majority of dictionaries 

16 categorically exclude document translation from the 

17 scope of --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Webster's Third, as I 

19 recall, is the dictionary that defines "imply" to mean 

"infer" --

21  MR. FRIED: It does, Your Honor. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and "infer" to mean 

23 "imply." 

24  It's not a very good dictionary.

Official 

1  MR. FRIED: Well, the Court in the MCI -- in 

2 the MCI v. AT&T case did indicate that. 

3  But in any event, the -- on its terms, that 

4 definition supports our reading over Kan Pacific's 

because it does indicate, even as to that dictionary 

6 definition, that the -- that the most common meaning of 

7 the term is the meaning referring to spoken 

8 communication. And this Court frequently looks to the 

9 most common meaning for purposes of statutory 

interpretation, as it did in Mallard in construing the 

11 word "request," and in Ramsey in construing the word 

12 "envelope." 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could we get back to the 

14 issue? In the legislative history of this provision, is 

there any indication that Congress explicitly rejected 

16 translation work from its coverage? 

17  MR. FRIED: Well, I can talk -- there's a --

18 the text does. I mean, the text --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Outside of the text. Is 

there a statement by one of the sponsors in the 

21 congressional bill or the study --

22  MR. FRIED: I'm not -- I'm sorry. 

23  I'm not sure that there's an explicit 

24 statement that I'm aware of in the legislative history. 

There's a lot of provisions in the legislative history

1 which plainly presuppose that. And the Congress 

2 received professional literature from -- documents from 

3 the American Association of Language Specialists. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Those are the other 

provisions that they passed with respect to --

6  MR. FRIED: Well, specifically with respect 

7 to costs, the Congress -- the House Report alludes to 

8 Rule 43(f), which is now 43(d), as a relevant 

9 pre-existing rule. And, of course, it's undisputed that 

Rule 43(d)'s cost provision is -- is limited to spoken 

11 communication of interpreters. So, there is that in the 

12 history as well. 

13  But I think that there's no doubt that in 

14 the -- under the text of the statute, subsection (k), 

the modes subsection, which appears at page 5a of the 

16 red brief appendix, as it was initially passed, 

17 expressly says that the interpretation under -- under 

18 this section must be done using methods that all 

19 agree are limited to spoken communication. 

Now, in the --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, if a lawyer sits 

22 down with an interpreter now in his office and says to 

23 the interpreter I can't pay for translation work; now, 

24 you sit here and interpret what this letter says for me 

-- is that what we're asking lawyers to do now?

1  MR. FRIED: Not at all, Your Honor. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we accept your 

3 reading? 

4  MR. FRIED: No, Your Honor. That would not 

constitute interpreting, because it would not -- the 

6 interpreter would not be communicating between live 

7 parties in the context of a real-time proceeding. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you would say that 

9 might be different in the courtroom. 

MR. FRIED: Well --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because the lawyer is 

12 communicating something live. It could be in the 

13 courtroom, but not outside. 

14  MR. FRIED: That -- that's correct, Your 

Honor. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there something 

17 logical about this? 

18  MR. FRIED: Yes, Your Honor, because in the 

19 courtroom, in the context of a live spoken proceeding, 

that satisfies all of the ordinary definitional elements 

21 of interpreting. But that's not the case in somebody's 

22 office in the presence of a single party and a written 

23 document.

2 absolutely clear in the vast majority of real-world 

3 incidents. 

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about depositions? 

The -- the translation would be of the spoken word, but 

6 it wouldn't be in court. 

7  MR. FRIED: Well, I do think there -- one 

8 could potentially argue that spoken interpretation at a 

9 deposition isn't covered in light of some of the 

dictionaries like Black's Law Dictionary, which -- which 

11 indicates that the word is restricted to people who work 

12 in trial. But I certainly think that it could be argued 

13 either way, in a case where --

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what's -- what's 

your position? I -- I take a deposition at -- in my law 

16 office and I have to have an interpreter there. Is that 

17 recoverable or not? 

18  MR. FRIED: I'm not sure we have a 

19 definitive -- I mean, I think you could argue it either 

way, Your Honor. It doesn't affect our case. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how do you think it 

22 affects the way you read the statute? What do you think 

23 should be the result? 

24  MR. FRIED: Well, I think there's a 

reasonable reading that that should be covered. I think

1 that that's certainly -- we have no vested interest in 

2 opposing that. I mean, that --

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you this 

4 question: In the background here, is there some concern 

that we're going to have minor cases but with huge 

6 translation costs, and it would be simply unfair? And 

7 if the answer to that is "yes," isn't that taken care of 

8 by the statutory direction that the court "may" give 

9 costs? 

MR. FRIED: Well, Your Honor, that sort of 

11 discretion demonstrably does not prevent the issuance of 

12 these large awards, because there have been a number of 

13 large awards issued notwithstanding that discretion. 

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, isn't that an abuse 

of discretion? 

16  MR. FRIED: Well, not necessarily, Your 

17 Honor. The -- the district courts --

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, in other 

19 words, if the court sees that the cost of preparing 

documents into an English-language is quite substantial 

21 in light of what's involved in the case, and it's just 

22 not fair to -- to award them, can't that court in its 

23 discretion deny that, or is that not the way it works? 

24  MR. FRIED: That's the way it works, Your 

Honor. But I don't think that that discretion is

1 sufficient to eliminate the deterrent effect that this 

2 Court has recognized in cases like Farmer and 

3 Fleischmann, because it occurs at the end of the case, 

4 after a litigant has already decided whether to bring 

suit. The deterrent effect occurs ex ante when a 

6 risk-averse litigant has to decide whether to bring the 

7 case. 

8  But I would just note that these sorts of 

9 policy questions, Your Honor, arise in the context of 

language that by its terms extends to interpreting and 

11 not translating. And we would say that the relevant 

12 policy question is simply whether there are sensible 

13 reasons to -- that Congress may have drawn a line where 

14 it did. And, plainly, there are adequate reasons that 

these services, document translation services that were 

16 excluded, are potentially large and fall under the 

17 general principles that this Court has recognized are --

18 are presumptively not frequently avoided --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I guess I'm -- I'm 

having a problem with, you know, they're "potentially 

21 large." Interpretive services are potentially large, 

22 although you claim that they -- that they don't -- they 

23 have sort of a terminus point. I've been in trials 

24 where we've had multiple languages simultaneously being 

translated to multiple defendants, with witnesses

1 speaking even other languages. I was in the Southern 

2 District of New York. And fees there without 

3 translation, just for the oral courtroom work, sometimes 

4 went ahead for months. 

So, potentiality's not the question. If 

6 you're talking about disproportionality, then that goes 

7 to the word "reasonable" in the statute, doesn't it? I 

8 mean, the Ortho case you point to, the court did sizably 

9 cut the translation fees. And, more importantly, from 

the little I can tell, that was a huge patent case with 

11 a patent that was claimed to control 60 percent of a 

12 market. 

13  So, I don't know that that was a small case 

14 by anyone's definition. 

MR. FRIED: Certainly, Your Honor. I -- as 

16 to the difference, I mean, I'm not aware of, under this 

17 statute, an interpreter's spoken interpretation award 

18 approaching anywhere near some of the larger document 

19 translation awards that have been issued. But 

nonetheless, I am not denying that there could be large

22 adding on document translation awards is additive. 

23  The sort of necessity review that would be 

24 necessary to police these document translation awards 

would be quite burdensome on the district courts. And,

1 in fact, the necessity standard is actually particularly 

2 problematic to apply to translations, Your Honor, 

3 because the fact is you don't know what a document says 

4 until it has been translated. And the exercise of 

trying to go back and reconstruct ex ante what a --

6 whether a person was reasonably necessary in causing to 

7 be translated something that they didn't know what it 

8 meant is likely to lead to very subjective --

9  JUSTICE BREYER: Why haven't the -- I was 

interested here that the amici on your side consist of 

11 some professors and the -- I guess the trade association 

12 of interpreters or translators, but the people who would 

13 have the financial stake in it, the defense bar, the 

14 plaintiffs' bar in some circumstances, have not filed 

any brief. And I tend, though not putting a lot of 

16 weight on it, to take it as a sign, along with the long 

17 period of time, that there hasn't been some tremendous 

18 financial problem. What evidence is there that there 

19 has been? I -- a few cases, but in general. 

MR. FRIED: Your Honor, I'm not at all 

21 suggesting that there has been a tremendous financial 

22 strain on the system. We're saying that this is a

We agree. And -- and the structural reasons are --

21 within the Court Interpreters Act itself are every bit 

22 as powerful as the ordinary textual indicia that support 

23 our reading. 

24  And, in fact, Kan Pacific's argument that 

the word "interpreters" should be assigned different 

23
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 meanings in different parts of the statute is -- is 

2 unsupported. Kan Pacific relies on what it 

3 characterizes as different language in section 2, which 

4 put in 1827 and 1828, and section 7, which put in the 

cost provision. And it notes that section 2 sometimes 

6 uses the broader phrase "interpreters in courts of the 

7 United States," whereas section 7 uses the word 

8 "interpreters" alone. 

9  But Kan Pacific doesn't examine the context 

in which section 2 does and does not use that broader 

11 phrase. And those specifics really undermine any 

12 argument I might make along these lines. As originally 

13 passed in section 2, 1827 contains 26 occurrences of the 

14 word "interpreter," not counting the title. And of 

those 26 uses, 24 simply use the word "interpreter" by 

16 itself. So, there's certainly at the very threshold no 

17 overarching pattern of usage distinction between them. 

18  More fundamentally, though, the -- the 

19 substantive provisions addressing the use of 

interpreters by parties in these cases in 1827 do so 

21 without using that broader phrase. Subsection (d) --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do so without --

23  MR. FRIED: Without -- I'm sorry, Your 

24 Honor. Without using the broader phrase "in courts of 

the United States."

Official 

1  Subsection (d) is the provision that -- that 

2 governs the use of interpreters in cases brought by the 

3 government. This appears at page 2a of the red brief 

4 appendix. And it simply provides that upon a 

determination of need, the services of an interpreter 

6 will be used in these cases. 

7  The only two provisions that use the phrase 

8 "interpreters in courts of the United States" are 

9 subsections (a) and (b), which are both at 1a of the red 

brief appendix, and both of these provisions simply are 

11 addressing the scope of the Administrative Office's 

12 duties under the statute. And as such, it simply makes 

13 clear that, in keeping with the office's ordinary 

14 function, it's -- it's facilitating the work of the 

Federal courts and making clear that the office isn't, 

16 for instance, certifying interpreters for the State 

17 courts. 

18  So, nothing in this language suggests in any 

19 way that the -- that the word "interpreter" means 

something different in different places or that the --

21 or that the services of an interpreter are viewed as 

22 embracing the same thing. 

23  So, we think that a variety of indicia of 

24 meaning converge in this case to support the conclusion 

that 1920(6) is limited to spoken communication.

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB 


7  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 


8  MR. HIMMELFARB: Thank you, 


9 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 


The word "interpreter" has two possible 

11 meanings that are relevant here, a broader one and a 

12 narrower one. The broader meaning is a person who 

13 translates from one language to another. Under this 

14 definition, the terms "interpreter" and "translator" are 

used interchangeably. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Have you ever seen a book, 

17 you know, translated from a foreign language, you know, 

18 "War and Peace," you know, and you're at the mercy of 

19 what we call the translator, and it says on the fly 

page, you know, "John Smith," comma, "Trans.," period. 

21 Does it ever say "John Smith," comma, "Int.," period? 

22  MR. HIMMELFARB: It's used in the narrower 

23 sense in that context, I think, Justice Scalia. The 

24 narrower meaning of "interpreter" is member of a 

profession that specializes in oral translation; and in 

26
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 that narrower sense, an interpreter is distinct from a 

2 translator, which is the sense you've just identified, 

3 which is a person who specializes in written 

4 translation. 

Our submission is that, as the great 

6 majority of courts who've expressed a view on this 

7 question have recognized, the broader definition makes 

8 more -- more sense in the particular context at issue 

9 here. And we say that for a number of reasons. 

The first is that the basic purpose of 

11 translation in the litigation context is to make 

12 evidence intelligible to the parties and the court. 

13 Section 1920 reflects a congressional judgment that the 

14 cost of making evidence intelligible to the parties and 

the court can be borne by the losing party. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: No, it doesn't. It 

17 reflects that judgment only if you're right that 

18 "interpreter" means "translator." 

19  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you're begging the 

21 question. You could say that the one should embrace the 

22 other. But whether Congress thought that or not is 

23 mostly dependent on the language Congress used, isn't 

24 it? 

MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, let me be as clear as 

27
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 I possibly can. I'm obviously not standing here saying 

2 we lose under the language, but it would be a good idea 

3 for the statute to cover written translation. That's 

4 not a legitimate enterprise for a court interpreting a 


statute. 


6  What I'm saying is that the text of the 

7 statute bears two -- permissibly bears two possible 

8 meanings. That being the case, it is a legitimate 

9 enterprise for the Court to say which makes sense, which 


is it most likely that Congress would have intended in 

11 this particular context? 
12  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why does your-- why does your 
13 interpretation make sense? Shouldn't we view this 
14 against the backdrop of the American rule on fees, that 

each party generally bears its own costs and only in 

16 specific circumstances does the loser pay? Now, the 
17 taxation of costs is a very narrow concept. 
18  What is the difference between a case in 
19 which a lot of documents have to be rendered from one 

language to another prior to the court proceeding and a 

21 case in which there's a mass of scientific evidence that 
22 has to be interpreted by a scientist or financial 
23 evidence that has to be interpreted by an accountant? 
24 In those instances, the losing party doesn't pay for the 

winner's expenses, does it?

Official 

1  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, let me -- let me 


2 address the first part of your question first, which is 


3 essentially, as I understand it, isn't there a 


4 background principle that says costs don't get taxed? I 

actually think insofar as far as tax -- costs are 

6 concerned, as distinct from attorney's fees, the 

7 background principle actually goes the other way. 

8  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the background -- costs get 

9 taxed, but costs are very narrow. They are a very small 
part of the expenses of a party litigating a case. 

11 Isn't that -- isn't that true? 

12  MR. HIMMELFARB: I think ordinarily that's 

13 true, but I don't think that it follows -- it follows in 

14 any way that there is some sort of tie-breaking 
interpretive canon that says when you're interpreting 

16 the costs statute, some version of which has been in 

17 effect since the middle of the 19th century, if you're 

18 unsure about the scope of it, that you err on the side 

19 of narrowness rather than breadth. I just don't think 
there's any such interpretive principle. And --

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, aren't you asking for 

22 an interpretive principle that errs on the side of 

23 breadth rather than narrowness? 

24  MR. HIMMELFARB: No, we don't.

1 ourselves what's the most common, what's the best 

2 reading? 

3  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, I think you obviously 

4 have to start there in this case, as you do in any 

statutory case. And our submission is that you have two 

6 possible ordinary definitions. You have two possible 

7 common usages. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: But the dictionaries 

9 themselves tell us that one usage is far more common 

than the other. 

11  MR. HIMMELFARB: I mean, I guess I just have 

12 to dispute that. We have Webster's, which, you know, 

13 Justice Scalia's view notwithstanding, is viewed by many 

14 people as an authoritative dictionary of English 

language. We've got Black's Law Dictionary, which I 

16 think everyone agrees is the leading law dictionary, 

17 which provides as a definition of "interpreter" the 

18 broad definition that we advocate here. To be sure --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess Black's Law 

Dictionary, which -- the editor of it is a -- is a 

21 co-author with me. So, I -- I feel obliged to spring to 

22 his defense. 

23  (Laughter.) 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Since it is a law 

dictionary, presumably it ought to have taken into

1 account the cases you're referring to, many of which use 

2 the word in -- in this sense, right? 

3  MR. HIMMELFARB: That's true. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Garner. 

MR. HIMMELFARB: That's absolutely true, and 

6 just as a dictionary, a law dictionary, will take those 

7 cases into account, I think it's ordinarily presumed 

8 that Congress is taking into account the cases, too, and 

9 it's taking into account dictionary definitions as well. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One -- one of the 

11 things that concerns me is the impact of -- of cost 

12 allowance on the normal litigation incentives. An 

13 interpreter in court is one thing. When you suddenly 

14 get a situation where the costs could be quite large, 

particularly in a -- in a disparate way, not necessarily 

16 shared by both sides -- somebody goes into court; they 

17 know they're going to have to -- if they lose, they'll 

18 have to pay an interpreter this. And the other side 

19 comes in and says, well, we think we need to submit this 

10,000 pages of -- of documents, which will have to be 

21 translated, and by the way, if you lose, you're going to 

22 pay for that. 

23  In other words, it is a much more variable 

24 element of costs than the interpreter. 

MR. HIMMELFARB: I -- I'm not sure that's 

31
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 true. I think in large litigations where you have many, 

2 many days of trial and potentially pretrial proceedings, 

3 you could have very large oral translation costs. Where 

4 there are many depositions, you could have large oral 

translation costs. 

6  But even if I were to accept the premise of 

7 your question, it seems to me that the way these costs 

8 get controlled is through the exercise of district 

9 courts' discretion, not to tax every -- the cost of 

translating every document. The Fifth Circuit, which is 

11 one of --

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, what -- so, what 

13 goes into the exercise of that discretion? 

14  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, typically the 

criteria for -- I should add that the criteria for 

16 taxing costs of every sort, not just interpreter costs 

17 and not just document translation costs, are essentially 

18 thought to be necessity and reasonableness. So, in 

19 connection with document translation costs, the Fifth 

Circuit has suggested that the way to tax them, the 

21 appropriate way to tax them, might be just to tax the 

22 cost of translating headings of foreign language 

23 documents, which should be sufficient to let the lawyer 

24 know whether this is a relevant document that might bear 

further translation, and then only the documents that

Official 

1 really turned out, based on the translation of the 

2 heading, to have some significance to the case. So, 

3 that's just one example of the way the discretion gets 

4 exercised. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Himmelfarb, in 

6 section 1920, there are two provisions that specify 

7 costs necessarily obtained for use in the case. And the 

8 interpreter provision doesn't have that qualification, 

9 doesn't say "necessarily obtained for use in the case." 

MR. HIMMELFARB: That's -- that's true. 

11 For --

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You are asking to read 

13 "interpreter" to mean "translator" as well and to import 

14 into sub (6) "necessary for use in the case." 

MR. HIMMELFARB: The necessity limitation in 

16 subsection (6), as with other subsections that don't 

17 specifically use the word "necessarily," come not from 

18 that term, but rather from the word "may" in the first 

19 sentence of the provision, which in tandem with Rule 54 

of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, essentially 

21 make this a discretionary call for the district court. 

22 Necessity has long been recognized as one of the 

23 components of that discretionary determination. 

24  The reason we say it doesn't make sense to 

have the narrower definition of "interpreter" be the one

1 that Congress enacted is that written document 

2 translation can be and often is every bit as important 

3 as oral translation. In many cases, it could be more 

4 important, in a contract case, for example. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think on the --

6 I guess nobody wants to defend this argument, including 

7 you, but the First Circuit and several others did look 

8 to the provision which permits the taxing of costs for 

9 the making of -- it says exemplifications or official 

documents, for the costs of making copies of any 

11 materials obtained for use in the case. 

12  Now, if you're going to make a copy for use 

13 of the case of something in Japanese, you're going to 

14 have to turn it into English. So, they included that as 

part of the cost of making copies of the material – of a 

16 document for use in the case. Now -- which is 

17 discretionary as to whether you do or whether you don't. 

18 But that's how several courts did read it. I'm just 

19 wondering as that didn't strike me as so obviously 

wrong. Maybe it's obviously --

21  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, I mean, I suppose it 

22 goes without saying that we'd rather win under 

23 subsection (4) than lose under subsection (6). There 

24 are --

1 on any subsection. 


2  (Laughter.) 


3  MR. HIMMELFARB: That's true, absolutely 


4 true. 


There are some courts that have suggested 

6 that document translation fits under subsection (4). I 

7 think those that have done so have tended to do it --

8 tended to do it before section (6) was added in 1978. 

9 We haven't --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, the history 

11 is that, prior to '78, a serious number -- some number 

12 of circuits said you can get the translation paid for 

13 under -- as -- as being necessary to create a copy 

14 that's usable in court. All right. Then Congress 

passes this, knowing of those cases in principle. And 

16 then there is a shift after Congress passes this, and 

17 then the majority of courts say, all right, this is the 

18 provision that permits it. Is that an accurate 

19 statement? 

MR. HIMMELFARB: I think that is accurate. 

21 Before 1978, some of the courts that taxed document 

22 translation costs, I believe, also relied on their 

23 inherent authority, which at the time was thought to be 

24 a permissible ground for taxing costs.

2 didn't want these taxed? 

3  MR. HIMMELFARB: Absolutely not. There

of the Court Interpreters Act really that bears on this 

6 issue one way or another. There's a lot of legislative 

7 history on which Petitioner relies, but it's all 

8 addressed to section 2, which is a separate provision 

9 which deals with a separate subject, which is the 

appointment of interpreters in cases initiated by the 

11 United States. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, if there is no 

13 legislative history, there's no legislative history on 

14 the other side either, right? Saying that we -- we mean 

this to include translation. 

16  MR. HIMMELFARB: No, that's right. We 

17 don't -- we --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, absent legislative 

19 history, I guess we have to rely on the words of the

dispute the fact that it is more natural and common to 

6 speak of someone interpreting oral communication and 

7 someone translating written, correct? 

8  MR. HIMMELFARB: I don't -- I -- I think I 

9 would dispute it. I don't know whether one is more 

common than the other in any meaningful way. It may be 

11 slightly more common to use it in its narrower sense to 

12 refer to a member of a profession, but it's certainly 

13 common enough that you have district judges from all 

14 over the country in written opinion just sort of 

matter-of-factly talking about the people who translate 

16 documents as interpreters. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, how about in the U.S. 

18 Code? Is there any place in the U.S. Code where the 

19 word "interpreters" clearly encompasses written 

translators? 

21  MR. HIMMELFARB: I'm not aware of any. 

22 There aren't -- there -- I frankly don't think there are 

23 that many places in the United States Code where the 

24 term "interpreter" is used other than in its sort of 

obvious, narrow sense based on the context of the

1 statute. So, for example, a number of statutes talk 

2 about funding translators and interpreters who are not 

3 citizens of the United States. It seems to us that in 

4 that context what Congress is getting at is the 

interpreter and translator in the narrower sense of 

6 members of a profession. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, in every other case in 

8 which the U.S. Code uses the word, "interpreters" means 

9 only oral translators, and that's the obvious way to use 

the word, but in this case, we're supposed to reach a 

11 different conclusion. 

12  MR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Kagan, I would say 

13 this: In every other provision of the United States 

14 Code in which the "interpreter" -- the word 

"interpreter" is used, either it's not clear whether it 

16 includes document translation or the context is such 

17 that it strongly indicates that it's limited to oral 

18 translation. And neither of those situations obtains 

19 here, in our view. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose somebody --

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just to phrase 

22 your answer a different way, you're -- you don't know of 

23 any situation in the U.S. Code where "translators" -- or

6 where it is clear that it covers document translation. 

7 There are -- there are State statutes which we've cited 

8 which use the term "interpreter" to -- to clearly cover 

9 document translation, and we cite them in our brief. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose somebody did a 

11 computer search in a database of, let's say, newspaper 

12 articles, magazine articles for use of the term 

13 "interpreter" in relationship to a foreign language. 

14 And let's say you look at a thousand hits. 

How many of those do you think would use the 

16 term "interpreter" to refer to rendering a written 

17 document from one language to another? 

18  MR. HIMMELFARB: I think it -- I would not 

19 be at all surprised if it was more than 50 percent of 

the hits that used it in its narrower sense.

6  (Laughter.) 

7  MR. HIMMELFARB: I do want to say something 

8 about the concept of sight translation, which is 

9 something that my friend Mr. Fried adverted to. Sight 

translation is a hybrid endeavor. It is the oral 

11 translation of written documents. 

12  One of the reasons we think that the broader 

13 meaning of "interpreter" makes more sense in section 

14 1920 is that it can't really account in any sensible way 

for sight translation. In this case, for example, our 

16 counsel, Kan Pacific's counsel, took Taniguchi's 

17 deposition, and to prepare for the deposition, he 

18 reviewed -- he had to review some contracts which were 

19 written in Japanese and some medical records which were 

written in Japanese. 

21  Now, under our view, having those documents 

22 translated in writing to prepare for the deposition 

23 would result in a potentially taxable cost. Under 

24 Taniguchi's view, they wouldn't. But it sounds like 

under either party's view, if instead of handing those

1 documents off to a document translator to have them 

2 translated in writing, he had sat down in his law office 

3 with a member of the interpreter profession and said 

4 here's a box of documents; please, tell me what they 

say, that would potentially be a taxable cost. That 

6 seems to me to be a very odd result and one that's --

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's an odd result 

8 because nobody's going to do it, because at that point 

9 you don't know who is going to get saddled with the 

costs. So, it wouldn't be likely that you would do 

11 something that would increase the costs, would it? 

12  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, I don't know that it 

13 would increase the costs. It may be cheaper to use an 

14 oral translator -- an oral translator as opposed to a 

written document translator. And there might be a 

16 variety of reasons why you would choose to use one or 

17 another: time constraints, the importance of the 

18 particular document, what have you. But I don't think 

19 that it's likely that Congress would have thought that 

the potential taxability of the translation --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it -- is it clear? Does 

22 anybody contend, does the other side contend, that the 

23 use of a viva voce translation outside of court is 

24 covered by the meaning of "interpreter" here? I assume 

that "interpretation" here meant interpretation in the

1 oral proceeding that is the trial. 


2  And you're saying that if we hold against 


3 you, interpretation will still include all oral 


4 translations outside of the trial. 


MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, I think every court 

6 that's ever thought about this has found that 

7 deposition -- oral translation at deposition --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, at deposition, which I 

9 consider part of the -- part of the trial process, but 

not -- not in the lawyer's office where he asks somebody 

11 to sit down and -- and read this document to me. 

12  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, there's -- I don't 

13 see any basis in the statute or, frankly, in the 

14 practice of translators or interpreters for drawing that 

line in that particular place. 

16  And as far as the question where Taniguchi 

17 would have the Court draw it is concerned, I think 

18 that's a very hard question to answer, because he has 

19 moved back and forth so many times on that. His briefs 

offer several different -- several different narrow 

21 definitions of "interpreter," sometimes saying it's the 

22 oral translation of oral speech, sometimes saying it's 

23 the oral translation of any language, whether it's oral 

24 or written, sometimes saying it's limited to in-court 

interpretation; sometimes it's saying it's not.

1  That, it seems to us, is a very good reason 

2 for adopting the broader interpretation. It seems very 

3 unlikely that Congress would want courts to get into 

4 these extremely complicated and, frankly, unprincipled 

line-drawing exercises. 

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: I don't know, 

7 Mr. Himmelfarb. I mean, why is this any -- any 

8 different from any case in which we draw a line and we 

9 find that the result of drawing a line is that we've 

created some close cases, cases that are near the line. 

11  So, you know, just to give you an obvious 

12 example, the fact that there are some few minutes in 

13 every 24-hour period where's it's hard to say that 

14 something is night or day does not mean that there's not 

night and that there's not day. And that seems to me 

16 what the question is here. Yes, you can think up some 

17 hard cases, but they're just that; they're marginal 

18 cases. 

19  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, I think -- I think 

line drawing is sometimes a necessary exercise because 

21 the text of the statute compels you to do it. Our 

22 submission is that the text of this statute doesn't 

23 compel it, because you've got a readily available 

24 alternative interpretation which doesn't require any 

sorts of these line drawings.

1  And as far as whether this is sort of a --

2 an outlying -- the examples I give are outlying oddball 

3 circumstances goes, I don't think they are. Sight 

4 translation, for example, is a core function of 

interpreters and translators alike. 

6  And I guess the only other point I would 

7 say -- make about sight translation, my friend Mr. Fried 

8 suggested that that -- that is something that could only 

9 be covered if it takes place during the course of live 

proceedings, which I think is -- is yet another 

11 narrowing of the word "interpreter." But as far as I'm 

12 aware, most sight translation -- little, if any, sight 

13 translation actually occurs during the course --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: I accept -- I accept the 

following, that there was a history basically giving --

16 doing what you want before the statute, but the 

17 statute -- nobody thought what it was going to do that 

18 history. That statute is capable of being translated, 

19 but it isn't the most natural thing. 

And so, the question is, do we take -- go 

21 with the smaller capability, saying leave -- leave well 

22 enough alone, or do we say, gee, that's just too hard to 

23 translate it that -- to interpret the statute that way? 

24  Have you got any other example in the law? 

I mean, can you think of an example in the law which

1 I've been trying to think of where there was a history 

2 of doing something? A statute comes along that makes it 

3 a little tougher for the judges to do it, and then the 

4 Court says either, sorry, too tough now, or it says let 

sleeping dogs lie. 

6  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, I think -- I mean, I 

7 think it's an important point. And this goes to the 

8 question of, you know, whether it's difficult for 

9 district courts to make a determination of whether a 

particular document translation should be taxed, which 

11 is one of the arguments on the other side. I think the 

12 history of this is strong evidence that it's not 

13 difficult. 

14  Courts have been doing this, certainly, 

since 1978 when this provision was added and even before 

16 then. And they haven't had any evident difficulty in 

17 deciding whether to tax documents in its document 

18 translation, and if so, how much. So, I think the --

19 the history certainly bears on the case in that respect. 

A word --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Justice Breyer is 

22 asking, can you think of an example where words are not 

23 on their face plain, and the Court has looked to the 

24 practices that have been imbued into that word and said 

-- and we've decided that they will be accepted in the 

45

1 way that practice has given them meaning? 

2  MR. HIMMELFARB: I can't think of any case 

3 off the top of my head, and I think it's true that this 

4 case is a little bit different because, insofar as 

courts were taxing document translation costs before 

6 1978, they were relying on something other than the word 

7 "interpreter." So, it may be a stretch to say that when 

8 Congress chose to use the word "interpreter," it was 

9 necessarily incorporating what courts had previously 

done. 

11  But I don't think it's entirely irrelevant 

12 that this has been done for a long time, and I think 

13 it's not unfair to presume that Congress would have been 

14 aware of that. 

The Court Interpreters Act has two main 

16 provisions as relevant here. There's section 2, which 

17 is really the more -- the main provision, and then 

18 section 7, which became 1920(6) in Title 28, which is 

19 the provision at issue here. 

An important part of Taniguchi's submission 

21 is that section 2 is limited to oral translators, and, 

22 therefore, it should follow that section 7, the 

23 provision at issue here, is likewise limited to oral 

24 translators. 

And our main submission on that -- on that 

46
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

25

Official 

1 question is that Congress actually used different 

2 language in section 2 and section 7. Section 2 added 

3 two provisions to Title 28: section 1827 and section 

4 1828, which are titled, and which address, respectively, 

"Interpreters in courts of the United States" and 

6 "Special interpretation services." 

7  In section 7, which added subsection (6) to 

8 1920, Congress does not use those two phrases. Instead, 

9 it uses the phrase "interpreters" simply, not 

"interpreters in courts of the United States," and then 

11 "special interpretation services." 

12  So, to the extent that there is any 

13 appropriate canon about the use of similar or different 

14 language in different provisions of a statute, it seems 

to us that the appropriate canon is that one should 

16 presume that when Congress uses different language, it 

17 intends different meanings. 

18  I do want to respond to Mr. Fried's point 

19 about the number of times the word "interpreter" is used 

in section 2. And as I understand his point, is that --

21 it's that it's much more frequently used by itself than 

22 it is with the -- with the words "in courts of the 

23 United States." 

24  What the statute actually does is add -- say 

that it's adding section 1827, which it calls 

47

1 "Interpreters in courts of the United States." It then 

2 has a subsection that says that the Administrative 

3 Office of the United States Courts has to establish a 

4 program to facilitate the use of interpreters in courts 

of the United States. 

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where are you 

7 reading from? 

8  MR. HIMMELFARB: I'm sorry. This is the red 

9 brief, 1a of the appendix, which is the very beginning 

of the Court Interpreters Act. And then there's 

11 subsection (c), flipping over to the next page -- I'm 

12 sorry -- subsection (b), which says that the director 

13 has to certify interpreters in courts of the United 

14 States. 

So, what it does at the beginning of the 

16 statute is establish this thing called a certified 

17 interpreter in courts of the United States. When it 

18 thereafter speaks of "interpreter" simply, that's just a 

19 shorthand for a certified interpreter in courts of the 

United States. So, it seems to us that as far as the 

21 Court Interpreters Act is concerned, even if it's true 

22 that section 2 uses the term in the narrower sense, it 

23 doesn't necessarily follow that it's used in the 

24 narrower sense in section 7. 

And the only point I would add about that,

1 as we set -- point out in our brief, it's really not 

2 clear that section 2 is limited to oral translators. 

3  Soon after the Court Interpreters Act was 

4 enacted and for approximately 16 years thereafter, the 

Administrative Office would publish these notices in the 

6 Federal Register notifying the public that there were 

7 going to be certification exams for interpreters under 

8 section 2 of the Court Interpreters Act. These were 

9 pretty streamlined notices, not long at all. 

And one of the main aspects, the main 

11 sections, of the notice, was a list of what the director 

12 of the Administrative Office said were the -- were the 

13 duties of interpreters in courts of the United States. 

14 And to be sure, it listed simultaneous and consecutive 

interpreting, but it -- it listed sight translation, and 

16 it listed document translation. 

17  So, at a minimum, section 2 is not 

18 sufficiently clearly limited to oral translators, that 

19 the director of the Administrative Office couldn't issue 

these notices saying otherwise. 

21  I guess the -- the last point I would -- I 

22 want to make about other statutes, some of which use the 

23 term "interpreter" and "translator" together, I've 

24 already addressed that in part by saying that in many of 

those statutes, it really is pretty clearly used in the

1 narrower sense because you're talking about members of a 

2 profession. 

3  The -- the only other thing I would say 

4 about that is that the premise of Taniguchi's reliance 

on those statutes seems to be that it would be strangely 

6 redundant for Congress to speak in other statutes about 

7 interpreters and translators together, if, in fact, the 

8 two terms could be used interchangeably, and that 

9 redundancy should be avoided. 

But subsection (6) of 1920 itself has a 

11 redundancy in it because it covers both interpreters and 

12 special interpretation services. And I don't think 

13 anybody could dispute that anyone who carries out a 

14 special interpretation service is an interpreter. 

So, it's not at all odd to have redundancy 

16 when Congress is addressing the subject of translation.

19  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL S. FRIED 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

21  MR. FRIED: Very briefly, Your Honor, three 

22 points. 

23  In the first place, Justice Breyer, I just 

24 wanted to let you know that the first decision -- the 

first appellate decision construing 1920(6) to encompass 

50

Official 

1 document translation was the D.C. Circuit's decision in 

2 Quy in 1981. 

3  Second, Mr. Himmelfarb noted that Black's 

4 Law Dictionary takes a definition that arguably could 

encompass document translation, but he didn't mention 

6 that the -- that the operative version of Black's in 

7 1978 when this statute was passed did not -- was a 

8 different definition that excluded document translation. 

9  And this change in the definition occurred 

in 1999, in the seventh edition, after a number of these 

11 judicial decisions construing 1920(6) had already come 

12 down, which supports Your Honor's observation that it 

13 could very well merely reflect a recognition of these 

14 decisions, rather than independent support for them. 

Finally, Your Honors, Mr. Himmelfarb cited 

16 certain notices issued by the Administrative Office from 

17 many years ago. These brief notices were ministerial 

18 documents that simply announced a forthcoming 

19 examination. The office has issued the Guide to 

Judiciary Policy, which is the -- which is the fully 

21 expressed views on this issue and is posted on the 

22 office's Web site. It's current as of June 9th, 2011, 

23 and expressly provides that document translation is not 

24 a part of the statutory services of an interpreter. 

If there are further questions, I'd be happy
