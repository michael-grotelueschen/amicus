 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next this morning in Case 09-5801, 

Flores-Villar v. United States.

 Mr. Hubachek.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN F. HUBACHEK

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. HUBACHEK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In Nguyen, the Court approved the imposition 

of legitimation requirement only upon fathers of 

non-marital children born abroad. That was based on 

biological differences between men and women. It 

provided proof of parentage and proof of an opportunity 

to make a relationship with the child that adhered in 

birth as to the mother.

 But here, the residential requirements that 

are at issue here have no biological basis. They set up 

barriers to the transmission of citizenship by younger 

fathers, but not younger mothers, and they are based 

upon gender stereotypes that women, not men, would 

care -- would care for non-marital children.

 That scheme has been -- the Solicitor 

General has attempted to justify that scheme by claiming

that Congress was concerned about statelessness, but the 

record doesn't support that claim. Both the 1935 Law 

Review article -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: What separates a stereotype 

from a reality? Do you say it is not true that if there 

is a legitimate -- illegitimate child, it is much more 

likely that the woman will end up caring for it than 

that the father would?

 MR. HUBACHEK: What I was saying -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's not true?

 MR. HUBACHEK: I think it is more likely, 

but I think that empirical evidence has not carried the 

day in gender discrimination cases.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In all cases, it is true 

in general, but there are people who don't fit the mold. 

So a stereotype is true for maybe the majority of cases. 

It just means that you say: This is the way women are, 

this is the way men are.

 MR. HUBACHEK: Absolutely, and this is 

actually beyond just an empirical stereotype. The -- at 

congressional hearings, it was said that the woman is 

the sole legal parent of this child, totally excluding 

the man, which basically dates back to the notion of 

coverture where men were completely out of the picture 

and women were the ones who were responsible.

So in addition to the fact that -- the 

empirical portion of it, there is also just the notion 

that the legal parent was the woman. And that was 

specifically -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Wasn't that said in relation 

to the principle that only -- that where paternity was 

not established, the child would be regarded as having 

the citizenship of the mother under the law of virtually 

every country, if not every country, at that time?

 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, the law of many 

countries was that citizenship did go through the 

mother. But with respect to legitimation and this 

statute, Congress drew a distinction between all -- all 

parents of -- excuse me, all fathers of non-marital 

children and those who are legitimate. This statute 

applies only to those who are legitimate.

 The very Law Review article that Congress 

relied upon, according to the Solicitor General, says 

that in the case of legitimation, citizenship goes 

through the father. So the bottom line is that the 

very -- the very article they relied upon said that in 

one instance it goes through the mother, but in the 

instance of the people who are actually affected through 

this statute, those who legitimate, it goes through the 

father.

And there are also a number of situations 

under which mothers -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Until there is legitimation, 

it goes through the mother. It went through the mother 

under the law in virtually every country, right?

 MR. HUBACHEK: I respectfully disagree. At 

the time, in 1940, when this statute was passed, there 

were a number of situations where it wouldn't go through 

the mother. In China and Japan, if the father was 

merely known it would not go through the mother.

 There were three dozen countries at this 

time, including the English countries and those who 

followed its law, in which if their female citizen gave 

birth to a child somewhere other than in their country, 

citizenship would not travel through that mother because 

of the laws of those particular countries. There are 

also stateless women.

 So in all those situations, the citizenship 

would not go through the mother. It would have to go 

through the father, and this statutory scheme doesn't in 

any way provide for that.

 The scheme also creates severe risks of 

statelessness, as is set out in the Statelessness 

Scholar's brief, for married fathers. If a married 

father who is married to an alien, the -- in those

situations, there are a number of countries that would 

not allow the woman to transmit citizenship. So if the 

father was precluded by laws such as they were in the 

United States, that child would end up stateless as 

well. So there is substantial risk of statelessness and 

it continues today.

 There are numerous countries that have 

basically reinstituted that rule, that if the father is 

merely known, citizenship would not transmit through the 

mother. And those are primarily in the Middle East and 

some of them in Africa, and those are detailed in the 

Statelessness Scholars' brief.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hubachek, how do you 

deal with the argument that, really, this is a 

classification where the unmarried woman is being 

favored, because the unmarried father is being bracketed 

with the married couple? So it's kind of like 

Matthews v. Heckler: The woman is getting a special 

favor and the unwed father is treated like most people 

who married -- couples who have children.

 MR. HUBACHEK: This is not a case where 

Congress was seeking to remedy any sort of past 

discrimination against women, as was the case, say, in 

Schlesinger v. Ballard. There was no discrimination 

against women. Up until very shortly before this

statute was passed, it was clear under the State 

Department practices that the non-marital children of 

women did get women's citizenship, and it was also true 

as to men. So there was no discrimination that was 

being remedied in that situation.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that doesn't answer, 

I don't think, Justice Ginsberg's question, which is: 

This appears to be an exception to a generalized 

non-gender based requirement. Couples, male or female, 

and fathers, unmarried fathers, are subject to five 

years. Only unmarried mothers get the largesse of one 

year. Why isn't -- why shouldn't everybody just be put 

to the broader category rather than extending a largesse 

to a greater number of people?

 MR. HUBACHEK: The reason is, Justice 

Sotomayor, is that we are not talking about an exception 

here, the treatment that the non-marital mothers were 

getting. That was the standard prior to the 1940 

litigation -- 1940 legislation. There was no 

significance residence requirement.

 Then Congress imposed new residence 

requirements because it was concerned about the foreign 

influence in mixed marriages, meaning someone who was 

married to an alien. In those situations, Congress 

specifically said in the record that they were concerned

that when those children were born abroad, that they 

would have foreign influence, that they would be more 

foreign then they were American. That's not -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So doesn't the 5-year 

residency requirement address that? If we apply it 

generally, wouldn't the 5-year residency requirement 

honor Congress's concern about there being a substantial 

tie to the States?

 MR. HUBACHEK: Absolutely, it would. And 

that -- for -- that concern is not applicable when you 

are talking about two U.S. citizen parents to whom the 

extended residence requirement didn't apply. 

Non-marital mothers were assumed to be the ones who were 

going to be raising the children without the influence 

of an alien father.

 The non-marital fathers are in the same 

category as those, too. Those non-marital fathers who 

raise their children on their own, as Petitioner's 

father did in this case, are not subject to that type of 

foreign influence, so they should be grouped together 

with the women and with the two-citizen families, 

because they have the lack of foreign influence.

 So it's only as to the mixed-marriage 

couples who are married where there is a foreign 

influence problem, and they're the ones to whom the

expanded residence required -- was applied.

 Now, with respect to the -- the Solicitor 

General has raised concerns about the plenary power 

doctrine. And I would argue that that doesn't apply 

here for a couple of reasons.

 First is, we are not talking about the 

admission of aliens.

 Second is that the Court in Chadha Zadvydas 

said -- made clear that even when exercising that power, 

that congressional -- excuse me -- Congress's power is 

limited by constitutional limitations.

 Now, with respect to the entry of aliens, 

Congress made it very clear in passing this very statute 

that they considered those people who gained citizenship 

as of birth to be differently situated than aliens. 

That was a tradition that dated back to 1350. In 1790, 

Congress passed a statute saying that children born 

abroad to citizens -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is -- is this your -- are 

you taking this in the direction of an argument that 

Congress gets less deference in determining nationality 

than it does with admission to aliens?

 MR. HUBACHEK: What I'm saying, Your Honor, 

is that we are talking about the ability of a United 

States citizen, Petitioner's father, to transmit

citizenship, and that that is a traditional interest. 

Citizenship is extremely important and it's a tradition 

that citizens have been able to do for years.

 So yes, constitutional limitations should 

apply when the -- when Congress is drawing distinctions 

between men and women -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But you -- you want us to 

write an opinion that says Congress has less deference 

when it considering -- when it determines who should be 

a national of this country than it -- than when it 

determines who should be admitted as an alien?

 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, there is no tradition 

dating back to 1350 for the admission of aliens. 

It's -- it's -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are you asking us to write 

that formulation in an opinion?

 MR. HUBACHEK: Your Honor, what I'm saying 

is that the -- that the due process guarantee of equal 

protection is applicable in this context because the 

citizens of the United States -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I -- if I take that as 

a "yes" answer, what is your authority for that answer? 

It seems to me that it ought to be just the other way 

around.

authority for that answer is the tradition that I have 

been discussing. Congress itself, in 1940, considered 

people who gained citizenship by birth abroad as being 

differently situated from aliens, aliens who naturalize. 

In fact, they said that that was universally -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course, but it was 

Congress that made the distinction. But you are asking 

us to say that Congress has less authority over this 

essential issue as to who should be nationals in the 

United States.

 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think -- that's -­

that's a -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Maybe there is some 

authority for that. Do you have any authority? Is 

there something I can read that tells me that?

 MR. HUBACHEK: Chadha Zadvydas says that 

even though Congress has plenary power over the 

immigration power. When it exercises that power, it has 

to apply with constitutional limitations. This is the 

first one of the Court's cases where -­

admissions case. You are talking about nationality.

being transmitted by a United States citizen. What we

because a similarly-situated woman would be able to 

transmit citizenship.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- I'm sorry. Go 

ahead. Finish.

 Are you finished?

 MR. HUBACHEK: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't quite follow this. 

As I understand it, on what -- say: On what remedy will 

there be if you're right? This is what I don't 

understand.

 A child is born abroad. One parent is 

American; the other is foreign. If the two are married, 

that child is American only if the father or the 

mother -- one or the other -- has lived in the United 

States for now at least 2 years. It used to be more. 

Okay? Now it's 5 years after the age of 16.

 Now suppose they are not married, and 

suppose the American is the father. Same rule.

 Now suppose they are not married and the 

American is the mother. Now it's not 5 years or 2 

years; you only have to have lived here for one year. 

Suppose I agree with you. I just don't see any sense to 

that whatsoever. I can't figure it out. They made a

mistake about the immigration laws. Suppose I agree 

with you.

 Then why isn't the remedy, say: Okay, 

whether it is the father or the mother, the general rule 

applies. They have to have lived in the United States 

for 5 years or for 2 years? Now 2 years.

 MR. HUBACHEK: There are a couple of reasons 

at least for that, Your Honor. First is that there is a 

structural limitation here to imposing a levelling-down 

type remedy, because citizenship cannot be taken away 

once it's granted. So the Court can't remedy the 

problem here -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Some people were lucky, and 

they are already citizens under this, and there we are, 

because their mother lived in the United States for one 

year. Those already are citizens. Nobody is going to 

take that away. We are just looking at a statute.

 And in the first part of the statute, they 

have in section (g) of 1401, the first rule I told you 

about. In 1409(a), the second rule, and in 1409(c), the 

third rule.

 Okay. If you are right about this, and it's 

totally unfair and there is no good reason whatsoever 

for distinguishing on the basis of gender, we strike 

(g). Okay?

Now, that would seem to be normal, but that 

isn't going to help your client. So how do you get to 

some other thing that instead of striking (g)? What we 

do is strike all of (a) and strike the whole thing 

before, and shove them all into (g), which isn't so easy 

to do with this language. How do you get there?

 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, the first thing is, is 

that this statute contains a severability clause. Very 

similar to -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. So we strike (g). 

What I'm worried about is, you want me to strike (a) -­

sorry, we strike (c). And you want me to strike 1409(a)

(g), which is a little tough to do in the English 

language. But I want to know how you get there.

 MR. HUBACHEK: By -- by extension, Your 

Honor. And -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: First, can we be clear 

about what you're saying? I thought your argument was, 

you are not touching married couples.

 MR. HUBACHEK: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that you are talking 

about equating the unmarried father to the unmarried 

mother. Do you have -- is there any notion of how many 

people we're talking about?

I mean, in these extensions versus the 

normalization, where the Court generally extends when 

there is a small class to be covered, a small class was 

left out, and in a large class is already covered. And 

the reasoning has been: Well, my goodness, Congress 

wanted to take care of that larger class; it would be 

most destructive of the legislative will if we said you 

can't cover that larger class.

 So as a group of unmarried mothers as 

against unmarried fathers, do -- do you have any notion 

of what the numbers would be?

 MR. HUBACHEK: Justice Ginsberg, I don't 

have any statistics to provide the Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe this is -­

maybe you would like to answer Justice Breyer's 

question.

 MR. HUBACHEK: Yes, Justice Breyer. Anyway, 

the remedy we are requesting is extension. In Westcott 

and in Heckler, the Court looked at language in the 

severability clause that was similar to this, and also 

in Justice Harlan's concurring opinion in Welsh, and 

said that type of language in a severability clause 

gives courts power to grant an extension remedy.

 So that's what we are requesting. We're

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, there's another slight 

problem with that, I would think. Reading this 

carefully, which I hope I have done, it seems to me it 

may also discriminate against fathers. And that's 

because (c) says that the woman has to have been 

physically present for a continuous period of one year. 

I read at least one article that says that word, 

"continuous," doesn't appear with the fathers, and that 

they really mean it. That is, if somebody is living 

down in Texas and they happen to go visit on Christmas 

their father, who is -- or their grandmother or cousin 

or something who is across the border for 5 minutes, 

that they cannot take advantage of this clause (c).

 Is that true?

 MR. HUBACHEK: I don't know the answer to 

that, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I will ask the (g) that, 

but if it is true -- if it is true, then -- then I would 

think that the fathers are really worse off. I don't 

know if that helps you. And maybe it could turn out 

that that's really a problem.

 If it is really a problem, then the fathers 

are worse off. Does that help you with the remedy?

law when you have continuous requirements, if it's a

just want to know what the best way is of getting to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, he would have a 

remedy. The remedy for an equal protection violation is 

to treat everybody the same. You can do that either by 

lowering the people who are given a benefit or by 

increasing the people who aren't. So he has a remedy.

 His objection is, we're not being -- my 

father and my mother are not being treated the same. 

That's all of the relief he is entitled to.

 MR. HUBACHEK: You are absolutely right, 

that that is -- that is the state of the law. And my 

point is that structurally, that remedy is unavailable 

here, because you can't take away the citizenship from 

the people who have already gotten it.

 And the notion that you can grant us 

prospective relief as discussed in the Solicitor 

General's brief doesn't make any sense, either, because 

number one, this statute, the one we are talking about 

today, doesn't apply past people who were born before 

1986.

 But the thing is that if somebody were to 

come into court after an opinion that said just that 

were issued -- someone were to come into court and say, 

I want to claim citizenship through my mother, that 

person would still be entitled to citizenship because 

it's as of the day of birth. So this is a retroactive

provision.

 So the prospective relief notion really 

doesn't makes any sense in this context, because the 

equal protection violations have basically all already 

occurred at the time that the person who would make a 

citizenship claim was born, and we would still be left 

in a situation where Petitioner's father would say that 

I was unable to transmit citizenship to my son and a 

woman who was similarly situated was able to. So that 

type of remedy is unavailable.

 In the Court's decision in Iowa v. Bennett, 

the bank case, they actually ordered a refund of the 

taxes that were collected in a discriminatory manner 

dating back in time. So if you could factor out -- if 

you could make a relief that would take away the benefit 

that others had received, then I would agree that that 

is available, but that's not possible in this situation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hubachek, I think the 

Chief asked you: If it's an equal protection violation, 

then the Court just says it violates equal protection, 

but whether it goes up or down, the Court has to give a 

temporary solution, because the legislature can't be 

convened on the spot. And the Court actually did go 

through that exercise, extension versus invalidation, 

most conspicuously in Califano -- Westcott, in the

Westcott case. It says, yes, that's what we have been 

doing in all these cases.

 In Sarah Frontiero's case, we didn't say: 

You've been discriminated against; Congress, you fix it. 

We said: You get the quarters' allowance that up until 

now has been available only in male officers. And in 

Wiesenthal, the father got the same child and care 

benefits as the mother. So the Court was making a 

decision for extension; it recognized it had to do that.

 MR. HUBACHEK: Absolutely. And in many of 

the benefits cases, the same -- the same analysis was 

available and that's the analysis that we are asking 

that the Court apply here. But we're also making -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hubacheck, you are 

asking, I think, that the Court pronounce your client to 

be a United States citizen. Isn't that the only 

pronouncement from -- form the Court that is going to do 

your client any good?

 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, Justice Scalia -­

citizen.

technically what we are asking is for a reversal of the 

judgment and opportunity to present this -­

on the grounds that your client is a United States 

citizen, right?

 MR. HUBACHEK: That it would be possible for 

him, on these facts, to become a United States citizen, 

yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That he is a United 

States citizen.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That he is, not that -­

that he is. That he is. Do you have any other case 

where a Court has conferred citizenship on someone who, 

under the statutes as written, does not have it?

 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, that was one of the 

issues that was debated, of course, in the Nguyen and 

Miller cases, and the Court has not said that yet but it 

can in this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Never done.

 MR. HUBACHEK: That's correct. That's 

correct, but it can in this case, for a number of 

reasons. Number one is the fact that this severability 

clause is applicable to this claim. Congress actually 

passed a statute, 1421(d), in this same statutory 

scheme, that said when we are talking about 

naturalization -- the naturalization of aliens, then you 

cannot get naturalization under those circumstances any 

other way then what's set out in this statute. They

didn't say that as to claims of citizenship as of birth.

 So there is a negative implication, 

basically, that they -- that they were not precluding 

this type of remedy as to a citizenship claim where we 

are claiming an equal protection violation.

 The second point is that if the Court is 

unable to grant that remedy, that would leave an equal 

protection violation in place, and as Justice Harlan 

made clear in Welsh -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless -- unless we -- we 

solve the violation the other way, by saying that the 

father gets the shorter period that the -- than the 

mother has.

 MR. HUBACHEK: Well, again -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm sorry, that the mother 

gets the longer period than the father has.

 MR. HUBACHEK: Right. And I think if the 

Court -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: You say we can't apply that 

retroactively. Well, okay; we don't apply it 

retroactively. The people that have citizenship cannot 

constitutionally be deprived of it, but for everybody 

else, it's okay.

 MR. HUBACHEK: Even -- even prospectively, 

Your Honor, because this statute says you have

citizenship as of birth. So even if the Court were to 

render that decision and someone were to make a claim, 

they could still say: I had citizenship of as of birth; 

i.e., whenever I was born, which is before the Court's 

decision. So there really -- that would be no remedy at 

all. It's a remedy -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But any of -- of the 

remedies that you are discussing with Justice Scalia 

involves this Court in a highly intrusive exercise of 

the congressional power.

 Let me just ask you this as an analytic 

matter, or as matter of logical priorities. We usually 

talk about substance first, remedy second. Do you think 

it's permissible, logically, for us to say that because 

the remedies here are so intrusive, that bears on our 

choice of whether we or not we use intermediate or 

rational basis scrutiny, and because the remedies are so 

difficult, we are going to use rational basis scrutiny? 

Is that a logical way to proceed?

 MR. HUBACHEK: I don't think so. I think 

the Court has traditionally has said that the -- the 

questions of a right and whether or not there exists an 

opportunity to make a claim and the remedy for it are 

analytically distinct. So I don't believe -­

remedy can't be complicated, because courts are not set 

up to do that. I mean, that's what Westcott said. The 

court can go one way or another way; it can't do any 

fine-tuning, because it's there as a temporary 

legislature. The ball goes back to Congress to do what 

it will, but it's just, in the interim, we need a 

solution.

 MR. HUBACHEK: That's correct, and certainly 

Congress could do that. And the Solicitor General's 

brief makes clear that what was being balanced here was 

concerns about -- according to them, anyway -- concerns 

about statelessness on the one hand and connection to 

the United States on the other.

 If Congress hadn't assumed based on gender 

stereotypes that men weren't caring for children, then 

it would have -- it would have been able to put them in 

the same category as women, because they would 

understand that both of them would be caring for 

children.

 And it's not just the -- the situation in 

1940. As time has gone on, I believe in the National 

Women's Center brief it points out that the number of 

men who are raising children in single-parent families 

is increasing over time. So the problem, if anything, 

is getting worse.

 MR. HUBACHEK: The current system is five 

years, two years after the -- the age of 16 -- I'm 

sorry, after the age of 14. And of course, that age 

requirement here completely precluded 

Mr. Flores-Villar's father from being able to transmit 

citizenship because of his age. That kind of complete 

preclusion would never apply to a woman who is similarly 

situated.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Congress in deciding who among the various 

people born abroad should be made citizens of the United 

States has to take into account myriad factors that may 

bear on that question and its judgment. They include 

importantly Congress's prediction in the case of 

conferring citizenship at birth, what would be that

person's likely connection to the United States. 

Congress also has to consider the interaction with the 

laws of other countries where these people may be born. 

It may take into account equities, potential 

statelessness or dual nationality. These are 

complicated questions to which the courts should defer. 

Now, in the particular -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Intermediate scrutiny

 MR. KNEEDLER: Excuse me.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Unless we apply strict 

scrutiny, which no one is arguing for, the question is, 

is it rational basis deference or is it some 

intermediate scrutiny, correct?

Bell and the cases discussed in that case, that it 

should be rational basis for -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, but you can't 

really mean that because we can put up a hypothetical 

that is very simple and then you'll explain to me why a 

U.S. citizen should be burdened in this way and the 

hypothetical is, let's assume Congress determines that 

there are too many foreign-born children of U.S. 

citizens coming into the United States, and that those

foreign-born children, those born of women are placing a 

greater burden on our economic system. They need more 

care for reasons that Congress determines analytically 

or statistically. They are spending more money -- more 

government money. And Congress passes a rule that says, 

only the foreign-born children of men can come into the 

country, not of women. Wouldn't that be a rational 

basis?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I think the answer to that 

question lies in the Court's formulation of the test 

that is applied in this particular context, and that is 

the formulation drawn from Kleindienst v. Mandel that 

was articulated in Fiallo v. Bell, and that is that 

there has to be a facially legitimate and bona fide 

reason.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There is a facially 

legitimate bona fide reason.

no trouble concluding that an arbitrary choice between 

men and women -­

government saying, I want to spend less money on a new 

citizen?

test also encompasses means not just end, and if 

Congress is just arbitrarily choosing between men and 

women or people of a different race, I think given this 

Court's tradition it could conclude that those would be 

impermissible bases under the well-established test, but 

for the reasons we say in our brief we don't -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What well established 

test?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Fiallo v. Bell for -- and the 

cases underlying it and we also think -­

basis plus test you are talking about?

 MR. KNEEDLER: You could call it that or you 

could call it a facially legitimate -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now we're going to 

just continue sort of tweaking the definitions and 

creating more variations on our review standard?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I think it is -- it is a test 

that this Court has articulated in Fiallo v. Bell and 

Kleindienst v. Mandel to address this very situation, 

including a situation where asserted constitutional 

rights of U.S. citizens in this country are being 

claimed. And we agree with Justice Kennedy that the 

standard should not be more demanding, but rather if 

anything it should be less demanding where the question

is whether someone should be made a citizen.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's hard here because 

both the father -- this father, but many fathers and 

mothers are actually U.S. citizens who want to bring 

their children over as U.S. citizens. So, if the father 

was making the claim here, you would still argue it was 

a rational basis test even though he's a U.S. citizen 

and entitled to all the protections of the Constitution?

 MR. KNEEDLER: We would argue for the 

facially legitimate -- and that was the case in Fiallo, 

in which the plaintiffs included U.S. citizens, children 

and fathers, claiming that, in a very parallel situation 

claiming that that special privileges for illegitimate 

children to reunite with the mother worked an 

unconstitutional discrimination against the fathers of 

such children. And it was U.S. citizen fathers and 

children who were among the plaintiffs and the Court 

nonetheless said that this is -- there is no 

constitutional right to pass citizenship, this is a 

question of Congress's judgment about who it believes 

should be made citizens. And one of the important 

factors Congress has looked at is connection to a U.S. 

citizen that is in turn a proxy for what the likely 

connection to the United States will be.

you are doing is applying a lesser standard to gender 

discrimination than is ordinarily applied to gender 

discrimination. Now, is there any reason to do that? 

think that was the thrust of the question.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, that was the issue.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now fine.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: In Fiallo v. Bell.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If it's the government's 

position you do, does the same thing apply to racial 

discrimination? Do you also apply a lesser standard to 

racial discrimination?

reliance on race.

a big hole in the Fourteenth Amendment.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: First, in Fiallo we were 

dealing not with citizens, this is someone, a

the Constitution, anyone born abroad is an alien unless 

and until Congress has passed a statute making them a 

citizen. So analytically, doctrinally it is the same 

question.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Congress has passed -­

has passed a statute making certain people citizens and 

the question is, has it done so in a way that is 

compatible with equal protection. But remind me too, 

because it's not in the front of my head, I thought that 

classification that was dealt with in Fiallo, wasn't it 

unwed parentage rather than gender?

 MR. KNEEDLER: But there were claims based 

on both illegitimacy and gender and there were equal 

protection claims based on both. But if I could move on 

to the way that the statute operates because we think it 

satisfies either standard of review in this case. And 

if I could just step back for a moment. As I mentioned, 

there are a number of factors that Congress takes into 

account in crafting a statute like this. 1401 deals 

with married couples and where both parents are 

citizens, all that is required is that one of the 

parents have resided in the United States prior to the 

birth.

 Where you have mixed parentage, the 

background of the enactment of this in 1940 and

reenactment in 1952 and continued up to this present day 

is Congress was concerned that such a child may not have 

the requisite connection to the United States. They 

have a connection to the parent, but may not have a 

connection to the United States such that Congress 

wanted to grant citizenship to that person. So what 

Congress did in the mixed citizenship situation was to 

require prior residency of the parent as a talisman, as 

the Court said in Rogers v. Bellei, for a connection to 

the United States of ten years, five years after the age 

of 14. Congress has liberalized that, but that was the 

basic thought. Where you have unwed parents, in 1409(a) 

what Congress did was to follow general principles of 

the law of illegitimacy or children born out of wedlock, 

if a father legitimates a child then it's as if the 

child was born in a marriage, and the rule in 1401 with 

respect to marriage applies. That is true whether both 

parents are citizens or in a mixed marriage situation. 

If a father legitimates a child and both parents are 

citizens, then not the one, then the child benefits from 

the rule that if either parent was present in the United 

States before birth he's a citizen, doesn't have to 

satisfy the one year unbroken residency requirement 

under 1409(c). If it's mixed parentage, and the father 

legitimates, then the rule applicable to married mixed

citizen and parents applies as if the child had been 

married at the outset. It's a perfectly sensible and 

provision or approach and consistent with the way this 

has been done. What Congress did with respect to the 

mother of the child born out of wedlock where there has 

not have been legitimation is to confer citizenship on 

the basis of a one year residency. Now, as counsel for 

the Petitioner explains, a mother in that situation who 

at the moment of birth, as this Court understood in 

Nguyen, that mother may be the only either legal parent 

or the only parent at the moment of birth with the 

requisite connection to the child to have an opportunity 

for this sort of connection at birth. So the mother in 

that circumstance is very much like the two citizen 

parent family, the only parents are parents with a 

connection to the United States.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, if -- if 

the classification then were that we want to encourage, 

because it's good for society, father/child 

relationships, so we are going to give that advantage, 

that is 1 year for fathers, and we're going to put the 

mothers together with the married couples, would that be 

compatible with equal protection?

rationale. I mean here what Congress -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I told you what the 

rationale was. The rationale was that we have lots of 

statutes like the Family Medical and Leave Act that 

attempt to encourage fathers to have a relationship with 

their children, to be a legal parent, so that's the 

rationale of this classification. They want to 

encourage the father/child relationship, therefore, they 

gave this 1 year is enough for the -- for the father. 

And everything else is the same, except it's the father 

who gets the 1 year, and the mother who gets the -- what 

is it, 10 years -­

MR. KNEEDLER: I think that would be a more 

difficult question, because Congress would be -- would 

be responding based on the -- on the expected behaviors 

and talents maybe of men and women. What's different 

here is that's not what it's -- that's not the basis for 

this classification. This -­

rationale. And -- and I would want to know -- I think I 

would want to know more about what the record for such a 

justification would be, et cetera. But I -- but I would

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The same as in the Family 

Medical Leave Act, we are making it a parental leave 

instead as if it had been historically a maternity.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. And in -- in that 

situation, I think it would be expanding on a 

gender-neutral basis rather than singling out one parent 

or the other. But I -- but I would like to finish the 

description, I have because it's incomplete and there is 

a critical piece left out, and that is that counsel for 

Petitioner says that if -- if a father legitimates an 

out-of-wedlock child, he is in the same position or that 

child is in the same position as a child in an 

out-of-wedlock mother, and that is not likely to be so, 

and it's not likely to be so at birth. And this is the

reason why, is when a child is legitimated, there are 

two parents who have the strong connection that was 

described in this Court's decision in Nguyen to that 

child, the U.S. citizen father, but also the mother, the 

alien mother in that country. So you have two parents 

whose interests have to be taken into account.

 Whereas in the situation Congress was 

addressing in 1409(c), the situation of a child born out 

of wedlock where there was no -- at the moment of birth, 

likely to be no recognized father, have you only the 

mother. If we -- if we think of this in -- in parallel 

to the illegitimacy -- the cases involving illegitimates 

that this Court has had in a domestic context, I think 

that is instructive. In a case like Lehr, where the 

question was whether the father of a child born out of 

wedlock should have received notice of a prospective 

adoption, the Court explained in that case that the 

father had not taken the steps necessary to form the 

relationship with the child, and therefore, be -- be a 

father in the eyes of the law, then the mother alone -­

provision.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The 1 year, I grant you, 

the time 1 year is treating them better than the time 5 

years. But the word "continuous," it's really tough is 

what your answer leads me to believe, and they really 

mean it. I mean, then that's treating them worse than 

treating the men. And I would like to know what is the 

rationale for treating them worse?

MR. KNEEDLER: Congress -- Congress 

selected, because while I said the mothers are like the 

two-citizen family or two-citizen parents in the sense 

that only U.S. citizens are the parent and you have some 

connection, Congress was balancing the duration of that 

connection or taking into account the duration of that 

connection and it chose to make it a little bit tougher. 

And I -- I think that is perfectly legitimate, because 

Congress -- because you only have one parent and 

Congress was deciding, well if somebody has been here 

for a continuous period of 1 year, then there -- then 

there is probably a greater likelihood that that person 

will -- will have roots here then, for example, the 

other situation where if you had a child born abroad and 

came home in the summers, that child may not think of 

himself or may not be regarded as an American in the 

same way.

 So, what Congress was focusing on a -- on a 

period of longer duration, which in its judgment 

could -- could give rise to, Congress believed, a 

greater connection to the United States.

first one in history in which it grants naturalization,

 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think the Court ought 

to strike the eligibility of -- of anyone to get 

citizenship on the basis of 1 year. I think it could -­

governed by 1401 -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about your

could legitimately take into account the -- the 

conferral of citizenship and the reliance on that. I 

think it's parallel to -- to Heckler v. Matthews, where 

the Court upheld a statute in which Congress took

So what do we do? If somebody under the theory that we 

say this person should not have been denied citizenship 

because of the unequal protection in the law, and he 

comes in and it's the same situation, he's going to be 

deported for not being an American citizen and he says 

I'm an American citizen.

 MR. KNEEDLER: I think -- I think.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does he get the 

benefit of that or not?

 MR. KNEEDLER: No, I think he does not. 

think -- I think the answer is that the -- and -- and 

partly for the reasons that you alluded to and 

Justice Scalia mentioned, we do not think that a court 

can properly grant U.S. citizenship, and that that 

should enforce -- excuse me -- inform the remedy, and 

it -- but for the people who have been granted 

citizenship, I think the solution would be to invalidate 

the 1-year residency requirement.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But why -- why would we

good whatever. It's -- it's a remedy that doesn't

granting relief that doesn't provide relief.

 MR. KNEEDLER: I suppose -- I suppose the 

Court could -- could decide that at the outset, that it 

would not be appropriate to grant that relief and not 

go -- and not go any further.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The reason it 

doesn't grant that relief is somewhat unusual in this 

case. It only doesn't grant him relief because of the 

third-party standing. He doesn't care whether he's 

treated equally or not; he just wants to be -- claim the 

benefit of citizenship.

 The person where he would get relief is if 

it were the father, because the relief that he is 

entitled to is to be treated equally. That's it.

 The relief this person is asking for is not 

to be deported. And so the problem of the relief being 

granted is really complicated by the fact that it's a 

case of third-party standing.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. I -- I agree with 

that as well, which I think is all the more reason for 

the Court to be cautious about -- about entering into 

this. I think that -­

was a father who was denied benefits to take care of a 

-- a child whose mother died at childbirth. And the 

Court came out a unanimous judgment but split three ways 

on why. And one of the members of the Court said, this 

is discrimination against the child, even though the 

classification was -- it's called a mother's benefit -­

it's discrimination against the child because it should 

make no difference at all whether the missing parent is 

female or male, that that was utterly irrational.

 That was the Chief -- that was then Justice 

Rehnquist's concurring opinion in Wiesenfeld. So he 

seemed to think that the discrimination was against the 

child and that that counted for equal protection 

purposes.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, here the only claim 

that has been raised is an equal protection violation of 

the parent's asserted rights.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's what --

Steven Wiesenfeld, the father was the plaintiff, but the 

Court -- at least one justice's rationale was that the 

discrimination is really against the child, but the 

father can raise him -­

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, insofar as any claim of 

discrimination by the child, I think, since it's not 

based on the child's gender, I think that would clearly

be a rational basis or facially legitimate standard; and 

Justice O'Connor's opinion in Miller v. Albright 

addressed the rational basis there.

 And here, this is not just based on the 

gender of the parent, it's based on the -- on the 

complexities in the legal history with respect to 

illegitimacy, and -- and how children born out of 

wedlock are dealt with, which again turns not on -- on 

stereotypes of behavior or talents, but on longstanding 

legal regimes not just in this country but in -- in 

other countries, that until the father does something to 

have a meaningful relationship, the mother is the -- is 

the only legal parent, or in the terminology of this 

Court's decision in Nguyen, the parent who is likely to 

have the meaningful relationship.

 Once the father comes forward in a case like 

Lehr, the result is not that the father gets a veto 

power or that that only the father's interests are taken 

into account; the answer is that you have two parents 

whose interests are taken into -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a case where 

mother versus father. But here it's a single parent. 

This is not a case where the father is doing something 

that the mother regards as disadvantageous. That was in 

the Lehr case.

MR. KNEEDLER: No -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you said something 

about -- this has nothing to do with stereotypes, this 

is the way the law was? But wasn't the law shaped 

because of the vision of the world of being divided into 

married couples, where the father is what counted, and 

unwed mothers, where she was -- they say both father and 

mother, because the law didn't regard him as having any 

kind of obligation?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, again, I think this is 

the issue the Court addressed in Nguyen, in which the 

Court -- the Court said that there is -- there is a 

difference at the moment of birth in the potential and 

therefore the likelihood of a -- of a connection of 

child to parent at the moment of birth that justified 

the requirement that -- that the father take a step to 

legitimate the child, in order to be able to -- to be on 

an equal footing with the mother with respect to -- to 

the rights.

 And here the residency requirement is what 

measures the connection of the parent to the United 

States, not the child to the parent; but we think the 

same point obtains, that at the moment of birth in 

another country, for example, another country might take 

a view that this Court did in Nguyen and Lehr and cases

like that, that the father doesn't have a meaningful 

connection to the child in the sense that one would 

predict citizenship on the basis of, until there had 

been some formal steps which would happen after birth to 

establish the relationship with the child. If it was 

constitutional for Congress to do that in Nguyen, it is 

constitutional for Congress to take into account that 

other countries might do the very same thing.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In Nguyen, I thought that 

this Court relied on the biological factor, which is not 

so here. I mean, here there is no question that this is 

the -- the natural parent of the child.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, yes, but in Nguyen the 

Court did not look at the circumstances of the 

particular case. It looked -- it looked generally to 

what would have justified Congress's acting 

categorically as we think Congress has to have the 

flexibility to do. And -- and I think the questions in 

these statutory provisions show that there are numerous 

competing equities and considerations that have to be 

taken into -- into account.

 And that -- that is what -- that is what 

Congress did here with respect to establishing a -- to 

requiring a close nexus to the United States. And if -­

done those steps, then you have a U.S. citizen mother 

and a father in another country that is directly 

parallel to the married mixed -- mixed parent marriage; 

and Congress was concerned about whether that child was 

going to be sufficiently affiliated with the United 

States to justify a conferral of citizenship.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if we 

determine that the only remedy we can impose is to 

equalize up -- in other words, add to the burden on the 

mother rather than relieving the father of it, do you 

have authority for the proposition that we can address 

that issue hypothetically? In other words, without 

making a decision on the equal protection question on 

the merits?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Um -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, look 

ahead and if you say, look, the only remedy that we are 

going to be able to give this person is a remedy that

complication from the remedial approach that the Chief 

Justice suggested. If the Court declared an expansion 

of citizenship, and if that was held to apply to 

everybody similarly situated, rather than just the 

Petitioner in this case, it would raise questions about 

whether Congress would have the freedom after such a 

declaration of a perhaps dramatic expansion of 

citizenship under the prior law, to remedy that with 

respect to people who for the -- following this Court's 

decision, at least the logic of the Court's decision 

would suggest that they were citizens, too.

office offers today is that further assumptions can be 

made that even after men do the things that the Court 

said were legitimately required of them, that they 

legitimate, that they have an opportunity to form a 

relationship with their child, that further gender-based 

assumptions should be put into place and say that, well, 

but you are not going to be the real father or you're 

not going to be the real parent. Whereas in the case of 

women we are going to assume that when they had have the 

nonmarital child they are going to be in charge and that 

when a father legitimates and does whatever is required 

wherever the child is born, we are going to assume that 

the mother is involved still. But the very facts of 

this case demonstrate that that's not the case. That in 

this case Petitioner's father raised him and 

Petitioner's mother was not involved in his growing up 

and he brought him to the United States -- I'm sorry, if 

I was getting a question. So it's basically piling 

further gender-related inferences on top of the ones 

that are already in place in order to serve to justify 

this distinction.

 Now, with respect to the Fiallo case, there 

is a tradition of allowing citizens to transmit 

citizenship. Fiallo involved getting aliens into the 

United States. There is no tradition that dates back to

1350 where citizens enjoyed rights to bring aliens into 

the United States, but it does date back to 1350 that 

you've been able to confer citizenship on your 

foreign-born children. So it is differently situated 

and it is differently situated in the very structure of 

the statute that we are talking about today. Congress 

very specifically eliminated the ability of courts to 

change the rules of naturalization of aliens. It 

basically used language very similar to the courts 

decision in Ginsberg and said that you can be 

naturalized under this provision and no other way. It 

didn't say that as to citizens as of birth. Citizens as 

of birth are treated differently. There is a 

severability clause in the statute, so that would apply 

to them and that brings into play all the various 

remedies that the Court has granted with the respect to 

extension over the years.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You referred -- I'm 

sorry, you refer to the tradition of passing -- do you 

agree with Mr. Kneedler that there is no such right?

 MR. HUBACHEK: I agree that the Constitution 

doesn't guarantee that right. Our point is that it's a 

traditional right and that Congress has always provided 

for it even in the period between 1802 and 1855 where 

the statute was strangely drafted and didn't provide for

it. This Court made clear in Montana v. Kennedy that 

when Congress remedied that situation it made that 

remedy retroactive. So basically we have an unbroken 

tradition dating back to 1350, that's why I think that 

this right should be treated differently than the 

questions of admissions of aliens in Fiallo. And, 

again, there is also Chadha Zadvydas that made clear 

that the Constitution limits the Congress's power even 

in the context of naturalization. And then with respect 

to the third-party standing issue, the Court has granted 

third-party standing to criminal defendants whose are 

raising third-party constitutional issues in their 

criminal cases, and the same analysis should apply here. 

We can still look at the right from the perspective of 

the Petitioner's father and if the Court grants a 

levelling down remedy, that would not remedy the 

situation the Petitioner's father would be in because 

both before and after the Court's decision the children 

of women, similarly situated women, would be citizens 

and Petitioner's father's son would not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What were the criminal 

cases where there was -- where the defendant was 

permitted to raise -­

MR. HUBACHEK: Campbell & Powers. Those are 

both cases where the criminal defendant asserted rights

of -- in one case it's a petit juror and another in the 

other case it was a grand juror, and there were 

discriminatory preemptory challenges in those cases, and 

the court allowed those criminal defendants to assert 

those constitutional rights.

 Several members of the court also found 

there was standing in Miller. Kowalski pointed out in 

Craig v. Boren that there is a very forgiving standard 

when third-party rights are at issue in the case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Counsel, the case submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
