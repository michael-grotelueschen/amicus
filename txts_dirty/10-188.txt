 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 10-188, Schindler Elevator Corporation v. 

United States ex rel. Daniel Kirk.

 Mr. Reiss.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN ALAN REISS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. REISS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The question in this case is whether a FOIA 

response is a report or investigation within the meaning 

of the False Claims Act public disclosure bar. Our 

position that it is allows the Court to reach the 

critical question whether a relator has contributed 

genuinely valuable information. The position taken by 

Mr. Kirk and the Government would disallow the public 

disclosure bar before reaching that critical issue, and 

it would therefore lead to a host of lawsuits by 

relators with no meaningful information to contribute, 

and that is precisely the result that the public -- the 

public disclosure bar is intended to prohibit.

 Now -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But suppose the FOIA 

information is just to confirm, to back up, to fill out;

that the -- the relator suspects there's a fraud going 

on, and he thinks that the -- the fraud will be 

documented by filings that the alleged fraudulent party 

has made in the government.

 MR. REISS: Justice -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. REISS: Justice Ginsburg, that may well 

be a legitimate use of a FOIA request, and the question 

then becomes whether the information disclosed in the 

FOIA response reveals the allegations and transactions 

upon which the qui tam suit is based. But that 

question, that use by a relator of the FOIA process, 

doesn't go to whether or not a FOIA response is itself a 

report or investigation within the statute.

 A relator can still escape the public 

disclosure bar if the relator can demonstrate that his 

complaint is not based upon the allegations and 

transactions that are disclosed in the FOIA response.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So in each case, we'd 

have to tell what was the -- the false claims claim; was 

it so heavily dependent on FOIA disclosures, or was the 

FOIA disclosures -- say they were a minimal part of 

the -­

MR. REISS: Precisely, Justice Ginsburg. In 

fact, what a court should do is precisely what the

district court did in this very case in a very thorough 

opinion. Judge Stein went through every element 

required for the public disclosure bar to be invoked, 

including whether the FOIA response was a report or 

investigation, including whether Mr. Kirk's complaint 

was based on allegations and transactions disclosed in 

that FOIA response, and concluded that every prong of 

the disclosure -- public disclosure bar was met, and, 

therefore, the public disclosure bar prevented 

Mr. Kirk's claims. And that is precisely the analysis 

that we contend ought to happen.

 Under the Government's position and 

Mr. Kirk's position, you never get to the critical 

inquiries about whether the allegations in a relator's 

complaint were publicly disclosed in a report or 

investigation, because under their view, a FOIA response 

itself is rarely going to qualify as a -- as an 

administrative report or as an administrative 

investigation.

 We think that view is plainly incorrect 

under the ordinary uses of the words "report or 

investigation," a position that was obviously found to 

be the case by the First, Fifth, and Third Circuits.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If I -- if I submitted, 

as we -- all Federal judges do, financial disclosure

statements to an administrative office, and then someone 

from the press has a Freedom of Information Act request 

to see that financial disclosure statement, does it then 

become -- does it become the report of the 

administrative office, rather than my report to the 

administrative office?

 MR. REISS: Well, Justice Ginsburg, that's 

an interesting question, and whether -- and some lower 

courts have held that if the Federal -- if the -- if the 

report -- even though the report is filled out by a 

nongovernmental person, such as yourself in this 

instance, it might still qualify as an administrative 

report because the information being sought is dictated 

by a Federal administrative agency.

 Now, we don't think you have to reach that 

position for -- for Schindler to prevail here, because 

the one thing that is clear is that a FOIA response by 

the Department of Labor is itself an administrative 

report or investigation. It is a Federal -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that in this case, 

the agency has said: Well, we have 10 files where these 

documents are, and we'll make them available you to in 

the reading room. Go to the reading room.

 Is that a report?

 MR. REISS: Justice Kennedy, if the agency

has exercised some selectivity in terms of what it's put 

in that reading room, we would argue that it is a 

report. That's a far cry from what we have here, but 

that's a much closer case.

 But with respect to FOIA responses, the 

third way in which information is disclosed by an agency 

under FOIA, it is always in response to a specific FOIA 

request. The FOIA response constitutes the agency's 

official response to that request. It's subject to 

appeal, appeals -- even subject to appeal in the Federal 

courts, and this Court itself has had -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't know if the 

files are digitized or not, but if they want this 

particular veteran's report, suppose you could just push 

a button, and they all come out. Is -- is that a report 

when those veteran's documents are just put together in 

a rubber band and shipped off?

 MR. REISS: It certainly is a report. A 

report is any officially sanctioned notification. 

Common understanding.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't sound 

like in normal parlance if you come to an agency and say 

I want these documents, and the person comes down and 

says here they are, he's not going to say here's my 

report. He's going to say here are the documents you

asked for; this is our response.

 MR. REISS: Mr. Chief Justice, it is a 

report in the following sense: The agency is saying, 

one, we have these documents; two, these documents are 

the very documents you're asking for. That is -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There's information, 

facts, that you can glean from their action, but that 

doesn't make what they've done a report.

 MR. REISS: Well, with all due respect, 

Mr. Chief Justice, I think their response in handing 

over the documents, saying these are the documents, is a 

report that we have these documents; here are the 

documents you've requested. Now, of course -­

for?

they're reporting where to look for it. It is a far cry 

from the FOIA responses at issue in this case and most 

FOIA responses. In this case, there are three different

FOIA responses at issue. The first two FOIA responses 

have two important pieces to them. They say, one, for 

certain years we couldn't find any of these VETS-100 

reports, we don't have them. We do have them for other 

years.

 Those responses communicated key facts upon 

which Mr. Kirk based his qui tam complaint. He alleged 

that in 6 of the years -- 6 of the 9 years at issue 

here, his allegation is Schindler never filed these 

required VETS-100 reports. The communication by the 

Department of Labor, we don't have those reports in 

those years, was the sole basis on which those 

allegations are made and is clearly a report. The 

report is: We don't have those reports.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your position 

that sometimes it can't -- a FOIA response can be a 

report and other times it's not?

 MR. REISS: No, Mr. Chief Justice. Our 

position is that every FOIA response is itself a 

report -- many will require an investigation -- but 

every FOIA response is itself a report within the 

ordinary meaning of the word "report," which is a 

notification. There are news reports, there are weather 

reports, there are traffic reports. There are, as in 

this case, VETS-100 reports. They are all reports.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So there's no difference 

between a report -- the government has an investigating 

commission and it works up a report -- as opposed to the 

many government agencies that are just repositories? 

They accept pieces of paper, reports, filed by other 

people, like a tax return, like a financial disclosure. 

The agency does nothing, has no input.

 I mean, there's surely different between 

those two kinds -- one, I would say, the natural 

understanding would be it's a report by the person who's 

filing it to the agency; and the other, where the agency 

puts personnel to investigate an issue, is a report of 

the agency. And you seem to say, no, they're all 

reports of the agency.

 MR. REISS: Justice Ginsburg, let me be 

clear. If -- if the agency simply had an open-door 

policy, just filed everything in a room and said in 

response to a FOIA request those documents are publicly 

available, you can go in and search our files, figure 

out if those reports are there or not -- that agency 

response would not be a -- a report or investigation. A 

response that simply says do the search yourself -­

document.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking you isn't 

there a difference between saying we want the raw 

filings, we want what Schindler filed, we don't want the 

government to do any investigations, we want them to do 

just the mechanical thing that they do under FOIA, and 

an agency saying we're going to investigate and make a 

report, we're going to put our people under the 

investigators, and we're going to interview witnesses, 

they're going to examine documents, and -- and we'll 

make a report?

 That's how I understand a government report. 

But it's very hard for me to understand how a report by 

Schindler becomes a government report simply because it 

is filed with the agency.

 MR. REISS: Justice Ginsburg, we think that 

reports and investigations can certainly vary 

drastically in degree and kind. An antitrust 

investigation may require millions and millions of 

documents and take the Justice Department 4 years.

 On the other hand, if the Department of 

Labor itself had decided to determine or to investigate 

whether Schindler itself had filed these VETS-100 

reports, it would have done exactly what it did in 

response to Mr. Kirk's FOIA request. It would have -­

it went to -- his request started out with the 

Department of Labor Office of Information.

 It was sent to the Division on Investigation 

and Compliance, located in a completely separate 

building. The response to his request was delivered by 

Mr. Robert Wilson, who is the chief of the 

Investigations and Compliance Division. His activity 

clearly constitutes an investigation, and the results 

that he gives to Mr. Kirk is clearly a report.

 There may be many other agency activities 

that are far more detailed, far more complex, but it 

doesn't make what is done in response to a FOIA request 

not a report or investigation. They are still reports 

and investigations within the ordinary meaning of those 

words.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But is the question whether 

the documents that are turned over themselves reports or 

whether they are included in a report? I thought what 

(e)(4) said was that you -- you determine whether it is 

in a congressional administrative or accounting office 

report.

 So that, suppose the Department of Labor 

issued what everybody would concede is a report and 

appended to that certain documents, wouldn't those 

documents be in the report, even though they are not the

report themselves?

 MR. REISS: Absolutely, Justice Alito. 

When -- when a FOIA response says, as it did in this 

case, we didn't -- say it says we didn't find certain 

documents; we did find certain documents. Here are the 

documents we found. The attachment of the documents 

that's found is part of the report, but the report is -­

is a complete report. We didn't find some things; we 

found these things, here are the things we found; they 

meet the description of what you asked for. The 

documents being attached are clearly part of the report.

 Now, we think that the position taken by the 

Government and the Respondent also creates fairly 

serious dislocations. Under the definition of "report" 

advanced by Mr. Kirk and the Government, many things 

that are actually called reports by statute are not 

reports.

 The Department of Labor's -- Department of 

Labor reports that it is required to file detailing its 

oversight and compliance of VEVRRA, the statute at issue 

here, is called a report under section 1354. The -- the 

report that every agency must file under the Freedom of 

Information Act detailing their activities and their 

compliance with FOIA, itself called a report under the 

Freedom of Information Act, that is not a report under

the definition advanced by the Government and Kirk, 

because they require some element that appears nowhere 

in the public disclosure bar. They require an element 

of some kind of search for wrongdoing or fraud. That 

definition appears nowhere in the public disclosure bar.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: We'll find out from them 

if that is what they have set their position. I had not 

read them to say that. I read them to say only -- to 

challenge your position that every FOIA response is 

necessarily a report for purposes of the False Claims 

Act.

 MR. REISS: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but their 

response is that certain FOIA responses will constitute 

a report or investigation, depending on the underlying 

documents that are disclosed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you request a report, 

then you get a report.

 MR. REISS: But -- but their -- their test 

for the underlying documents is effectively the 

resurrection of their on-the-trail notion that this 

Court rejected only last term in the Graham County case. 

They infused that requirement, the report requirement, 

with this notion that the government has to be looking 

for something wrong. And if the report that is 

disclosed along with, as Justice Alito points out, the

FOIA response is a report that indicates the government 

was looking for something wrong, well, that's a report. 

If it doesn't indicate that, it doesn't qualify as a 

report.

 We think that crabbed definition of report 

is not the ordinary definition of report, and this Court 

has said innumerable times, including I've heard even 

today that the Court looks to the ordinary, regular 

meaning of terms. The ordinary meaning of "report" 

clearly encompasses every FOIA response.

 If there are no further questions, Mr. Chief 

Justice, I would reserve my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN A. WILLENS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. WILLENS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Schindler is asking the Court to construe 

"administrative report" far too broadly. In its view, 

the public disclosure bar would apply to all FOIA 

documents, regardless of their content. It would also 

apply to nearly all other documents created or disclosed 

by the government. This construction of the bar would 

seriously undermine the operation of the False Claims

Act.

 Congress amended the Act in 1986 to 

encourage whistleblowers specifically to use government 

records in their investigations. This Court recognized 

that objective in the Hughes Aircraft case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Most of the -- maybe 

I'm -- maybe this isn't correct, but many FOIA responses 

include more than just turning over the documents. 

They've got a privilege log or other things, this 

exemption applies, here's a document, but these things 

are blacked out, and they tell you why. Is that a 

report?

 MR. WILLENS: No, Your Honor. If it's a 

FOIA response, it's not a report. The -- the documents 

here are very, very typical of a low-level FOIA 

response, and the -- this Court, of course, gets more 

complicated FOIA cases with our First Amendment issues 

and national security issues, but this is a very, very 

standard FOIA response. And the letter, which is in the 

record, is a very typical FOIA response. It's a form 

letter with three paragraphs: We got your request; 

here's what we found, you can appeal if you want to. 

They're all the same.

 So for this purpose, it's useful just to 

look at this one. That -- there's always a possibility

that a FOIA officer will uncover something else, a sign 

of wrongdoing, for example; but that -- at that point, 

it becomes not a FOIA case anymore, not a FOIA process 

anymore. FOIA is very limited to just the finding and 

releasing of documents. And for that reason, we -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it's not 

really because it does get into the assertion of 

exemptions and privileges, and -­

MR. WILLENS: That's true.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- things of that 

sort. And why isn't that a report of somebody's 

evaluation of the particular documents that are being 

released?

 MR. WILLENS: The -- all the work that Your 

Honor described goes into whether or not that document 

should be released; and under the False Claims Act test 

the release of documents is only the first test in the 

five-part public disclosure bar test. It -- FOIA just 

moves the -- the document from the government files into 

the public and satisfies the first prong of the test. 

But the Second Circuit said that the second part of the 

test requires an examination of the individual documents 

that are being released.

JUSTICE ALITO: So if the report does not

something does not involve information about fraudulent

 MR. WILLENS: We -- we wouldn't take that 

hard a line, Your Honor. The -- the material you're 

quoting comes out of the dictionary, and we were looking 

for a good -- it's based on dictionary definitions, I 

mean. We were looking for a good, reasonable definition 

to come out of Webster's Dictionary. We're asking the 

Court to adopt the Second Circuit's definition, which is 

broader and doesn't have an explicit requirement of 

investigation into fraud. And we certainly aren't 

asking the Court to rule that all the standard 

administrative reports that agencies issue all the time 

are not reports.

But it's very useful in a close case where 

the document doesn't say this is the administrative 

report or the report of staff on a particular issue -­

it's very helpful in a close case to look at the context 

of the statute.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could I ask you about 

a document to which your adversary referred? The 

Department of Justice and all of the other departments 

are required annually to issue what are termed Freedom 

of Information Act reports. Now, is that a report -­

MR. WILLENS: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- under the False Claims 

Act?

 MR. WILLENS: Yes, it is, Your Honor, and 

we've argued that because the FOIA uses the word 

"response" for the documents we're talking about today 

and uses the word "report" for that document that goes 

to Congress, it must have understood those words to mean 

different things.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But this report is -­

mechanical than responding to a FOIA report. It's 

basically a compilation of statistics: how many 

requests were filed, how long it took to process them, 

exemptions that were claimed, and so forth. So what's

the difference?

 MR. WILLENS: Well, FOIA is a special case, 

Your Honor; that's the first difference. It only looks 

into whether or not documents should move from 

government files into the public, and we're suggesting 

that because there's such a strong government purpose in 

encouraging whistleblowers to bring those documents out, 

that in order to give meaning to the list of enumerated 

sources here you have to look at what the documents are 

there, that are coming out.

 You can look at this FOIA cover letter, and 

I think you'll see that it doesn't have any substantive 

content to it. It just refers to the investigation, or 

it refers to the FOIA search that was -- that took place 

here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well -­

MR. WILLENS: In a lot of ways -- sorry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Give us -- give us your 

definition. You say you're not standing by the 

dictionary definition -­

MR. WILLENS: Right.

investigations into fraud. What else is it?

it's a definition -- the definition is a focused and

government end that would have to do with the policies 

and practices of the -- of the agency; that is, 

uncovering noncompliance or assembling information about 

a policy program or something like that. We're trying 

to distinguish that from -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know any -- any 

dictionary that gives that definition? I mean, the 

advantage of -- of the Petitioners' is they use a -- a 

dictionary definition. It may be a very broad one and 

you don't like it for that reason, but it is the way the 

word is sometimes used.

 MR. WILLENS: It is, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know any dictionary 

that would define the word the way you say it.

 MR. WILLENS: That's the Second Circuit's 

holding, Your Honor. That's exactly why we spent a 

large part of our brief explaining why there's a better 

dictionary definition than the one that Petitioner uses. 

One important difference -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which is -- can you point 

us to the page so we can see the Second Circuit's 

definition of report and the Second Circuit's definition 

of an FCA investigation?

definition that I read to be the position that you are 

advocating, not simply some dictionary -- some 

definition that happens to appear in the dictionary. 

understood that to be the test that you were saying we 

should adopt. Am I wrong? Did I misread your brief?

 MR. WILLENS: We -- we believe that that's a 

good definition that could be used, Your Honor, but the 

trouble is that there's not going to be any dictionary 

definition that covers all the innumerable ways that 

"administrative report" can be used. And I wanted to 

just -- to answer your earlier question to say that, of 

course, there are standard administrative reports that 

agencies issue. The -- the courts below have been 

resolving this kind of issue outside the FOIA context 

for 25 years since this statute was passed without any 

serious trouble.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But if we adopt your 

definition, isn't it true that a lot of things that are 

labeled Department of Labor report, Justice Department 

Freedom of Information Act report, are not reports?

helpful, Your Honor, and I also believe that the -- the 

Second Circuit's definition covers all of these kinds of 

reports, but there's no need for this Court to issue its 

own definition. There's another way of resolving this 

case, which is simply to answer the question of whether

have their own statutory and regulatory structure, are 

administrative reports or investigations on their own 

terms. And -­

yes, no; you know, we usually give reasons.

 MR. WILLENS: I agree with that, Your Honor, 

but point two of our brief is an explanation of why it 

makes sense not to have a categorical rule that every 

FOIA response and all of its attachments are always 

administrative reports and investigations. And I submit 

you don't have to, to find administrative report an 

investigation for all purposes in order just to answer 

that narrow question.

 For example, the word "investigation" is 

used in the False Claims Act for a very specific kind of 

investigation: a law enforcement investigation. And a 

FOIA search, which is defined in that statute as a 

review, is not an investigation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's talk about the 

purpose of the statute. Surely, that should bear upon 

how you read the -- what you read the words to mean. 

had thought that the purpose was as -- as Petitioner's 

counsel said, the purpose was to allow people to bring 

qui tam actions who have their own information and who 

are not just relying on information that they -- that is 

not personal to them. Is that accurate or not?

 MR. WILLENS: No, Your Honor. The -- the 

statute has always encouraged both insiders and people 

who are dealing with secondhand information, what we

used to call private attorney generals, to go out and do 

their own investigation. And Congress amended the 

statute in 1986 to encourage those people and insiders 

like Mr. Kirk to get documents out of the government 

files that they need as evidence to support their case.

 The case doesn't lack merit simply because 

the whistleblower needs additional evidence to prove his 

case in court, and FOIA is a critical aspect of that 

because relators frequently don't have one piece of 

information, which is what their corporation said to 

government contracting officers. That is, Mr. Kirk, for 

example, knows operationally -- he knows that every 

contract Schindler had for 15 years was breached because 

they were not following the key contractual provision to 

abide by the -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: He only knows that because 

of the FOIA response.

 MR. WILLENS: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because -- because the 

agency said we don't have any reports for those 5 years. 

Why isn't that information from the agency a report by 

the agency that we don't have any documents from those 5 

years, and, therefore, your client says they didn't file 

documents for those 5 years?

wrapped up in that -- in that question, Your Honor. But 

the point I'm trying to make is that Mr. Kirk has a vast 

amount of inside knowledge about this breach of contract 

that was going on for so many years, and it's different 

from the notification requirement. That's what triggers 

the False Claims Act liability.

 But it's different from saying that there 

was a fraudulent scheme going on for 10 or 15 years that 

damaged the government, damaged the veterans employed by 

the company, and -- and undermined the whole purpose of 

VEVRRA that requires it to be in these contracts.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the -- I think 

you've just divided up two issues. The first is, the 

FOIA letter does tell you that there weren't reports for 

certain years.

 MR. WILLENS: It said -- the word is that 

reports were not found.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Found. Now, the issue 

is different from whether the ones that were found were 

false or not; is that correct?

 MR. WILLENS: That's true, and I would say 

it's also different from the issue of whether they were 

filed, because the fact that the agency didn't find them 

during a cursory review of its records, which is -- a 

reasonable review of the records is all it's required to

do. In a compliance investigation, of course, they 

would go on much further. They would look to see if the 

documents were filed somewhere else. If they -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: But your client would 

search if they weren't filed, and on the basis of no 

other information except this FOIA response.

 MR. WILLENS: It's not no other information, 

Your Honor. It's a pattern of -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: How else does your client 

know that there were no reports filed for these years, 

which is part of the -- part of the claim here?

 MR. WILLENS: He knows that Schindler did 

not collect the information that it would have needed in 

order to file accurate reports.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He wasn't there during 

those years, was he?

 MR. WILLENS: He was only not there during 

the very tail end of our period, which runs from 1999 to 

2005. He was there and he was fired or let go in the 

middle of 2003, so he has personal knowledge of all of 

that failure to collect the information. The question, 

then, is whether Schindler filed false reports or failed 

to file them at all, and he alleged, without reference 

to the FOIA response, that it had to be one or the 

other. And either way, it's going to be a violation,

and that's sufficient at this stage of the case.

 We're the 12(b)(1) motion, Your Honor. I 

haven't had an opportunity for discovery and we don't 

know anything else about Schindler's conduct, but 

it's -- it's not correct to say that -- well, I think 

I've answered the question.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, may I ask you why a 

FOIA response doesn't satisfy the Second Circuit's test? 

An investigation, the Court says, quote, "implies a more 

focused and sustained inquiry toward a government end."

 Now, the government end in responding to a 

FOIA request is compliance with FOIA, and somebody has 

to search for these records and determine whether any 

exemptions apply, and that would seem to be focused and 

sustained. So what element is missing?

 MR. WILLENS: The -- there's a missing 

government end here because all that's happening is the 

transmission of documents from inside the agency to the 

outside the agency.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's the way the 

Second Circuit defined its own, or limited its own 

definition. But why isn't it -- why isn't the Ninth 

Circuit incorrect -- pardon me, the Second Circuit 

incorrect when it says that this is not a governmental 

end? It is a governmental end.

MR. WILLENS: Obviously, satisfying the 

requirements of FOIA and its regulations is a government 

end to that extent, but the Second Circuit was trying to 

distinguish between the substantive work of an agency 

and the more ministerial but still important act of 

taking documents out of files and sending them out to 

the public. A FOIA officer is -- is separate and apart 

in most cases from other programmatic officers in an 

agency, because we want to keep that act of taking 

documents out of the files and making them public 

separate from people who might not want those documents 

to go out into the files into the public.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The person is -- the 

person is separate but is often dealing on a regular 

basis with people who have line responsibilities and 

something else.

 MR. WILLENS: Of course.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He sees something -­

well, that looks like it might be a problem -- he gets 

on the phone or goes down there and says: Is this 

covered by the exemption or not?

 MR. WILLENS: Of course. I didn't mean to 

say that they don't speak to them. It's just that 

there's a different line of authority in most cases, and 

it's a different kind of mission. So I -- I hear the

question, and I understand the problem, but at some 

point you need to distinguish between what FOIA's trying 

to do, which is to make documents public, and what the 

government agency's work is, which is to implement its 

policies, procedures, sign contracts, build roads and 

whatever else it does.

 There's such a strong government purpose in 

getting these documents out to the public, and 

specifically in this case to relators and whistleblowers 

that this Court has held, 15 -- has held, almost 15 

years ago, that that is why Congress amended the statute 

in 1986, and to tell the Congress now 25 years later 

that they made a mistake when they used the word 

"administrative report" and they accidentally covered a 

vast number of documents, they could have used the word 

"agency records," which they used in FOIA to cover 

everything. But instead, Congress chose a very narrow 

set of enumerated sources, specifically so that other 

documents would be available to relators.

 As I tried to say before, getting those FOIA 

documents out to a relator is particularly important, 

because it has the correspondence between Schindler or 

other contractor and the government.

 JUSTICE ALITO: How do you determine which 

government ends count and which government ends don't

count?

 MR. WILLENS: My only argument is that FOIA 

is a different kind of mission.

 JUSTICE ALITO: That's the only 

government -- compliance with FOIA is the only 

government end that doesn't count?

 MR. WILLENS: I believe FOIA is a special 

case, Your Honor, and there are many reasons why that -­

that would be the case. We've argued that the -- the 

plain language of FOIA indicates that a response is not 

a report; a search is not an investigation.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So a report that goes to a 

department or agency's compliance with some law that is 

not directly related to the mission of that department, 

that would qualify as a -- as a government end for these 

purposes, but FOIA's the only thing that doesn't count?

 MR. WILLENS: FOIA is the only thing that -­

that doesn't count. It's like a publishing house or a 

little clearing house inside each agency whose job is to 

take manuscripts, or in this case, reports or audits or 

hearings or whatever, and take them out into the public. 

I think it's fair to distinguish between that function, 

the publication function, and the substantive work of 

the agency. If you don't do that, then you're heading 

down a slippery slope which Schindler eloquently

articulated in its reply brief. You end up at a point 

where not only FOIA documents are covered, but non-FOIA 

documents, in one case, even SEC filings, private SEC 

filings that are automatically posted to the 

commission's computer, Schindler seems to think that 

those are administrative reports.

 And you've, of course, transformed every 

private document, like these VETS-100 reports, into 

public documents simply by the process of corporate 

filing and then release by the government. There's 

simply no basis for that in the statute, and it would 

cause enormous harm to the operation of the statute.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY,

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

 MS. SHERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I want to start with one thing that hasn't 

yet been brought up this morning, and that is the 

context. We are not talking about words in isolation. 

We're not talking about the abstract meaning of the word 

"report." What we're talking about is public

disclosures of allegations or transactions in a 

congressional, administrative, or GAO report hearing, 

audit or investigation. And in that context, the word, 

the phrase "administrative report," the phrase 

"administrative investigation," has some meaning.

 When you speak of a congressional 

investigation, when you speak of a GAO report, and when 

you speak of an administrative audit, that conjures up a 

certain image that goes beyond the simple search for 

responsive records in response to a -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Your test, am I right -­

this is page 21 of your brief -- that it has to go to 

the uncovering of the truth of the matter or inquiring 

into wrongdoing. Is that your test?

 MS. SHERRY: I don't think it has to go just 

to the inquiring into wrongdoing. I think the way to 

think about it is whether or not the agency or the 

governmental entity is engaging in a substantive inquiry 

into and a substantive analysis of information of data, 

of facts, and that's the distinction between what an 

agency does in response to FOIA.

 FOIA is a means of public disclosure. It's 

a method by which an agency grants the public access to 

preexisting records that are in its possession. It is 

essentially the public disclosure component of the

public disclosure bar -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't the test whether -­

the test is whether there's a substantive analysis of 

facts?

 MS. SHERRY: There's a substantive analysis 

of the facts. For example, in the FOIA context, while 

the agency is certainly pulling responsive records and 

is engaging in some sort of inquiry into whether 

exemptions apply and whether the information can be 

released or should be released, it's not looking at the 

data. It's not looking at the information that's in 

that document for its substantive content.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So -- but when the -- when 

the DOJ pulls together at the end of the fiscal year the 

number of FOIA requests that it received and calculates 

the length of time they were pending and discloses that 

in the annual freedom of act -- Freedom of Information 

Act report, that is a report?

 MS. SHERRY: I think that would be a report 

under our definition because the Department of Justice 

is actually engaging with the data, engaging in the 

analysis. And if I'm remembering correctly, I think it 

also requires, for example, the Attorney General to 

report on how it's encouraging compliance with FOIA by 

the different agencies.

And so I think in most of the circumstances 

that it would still qualify as a report, and I think 

FOIA is quite distinct from that.

 And if you look at the facts of this case in 

particular, it demonstrates what the substance of the 

agency's action is in a FOIA case. It's -- again, it's 

a means of public disclosure. Congress could have 

enacted a very different public disclosure bar. In 1943 

to 1986, there was what was called the government 

knowledge bar.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Every report is a mean -­

means of public disclosure. Does -- the Freedom of 

Information Act report is a means of public disclosure, 

that's the reason that Congress required it.

 MS. SHERRY: That's -- that's certainly 

true, but the public disclosure bar requires more than 

just the public disclosure. Congress made the extra 

effort and included only particular enumerated 

governmental sources. Whatever the line is, we know 

that it cannot be any dissemination of information from 

a governmental entity.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But I'm -- I'm still 

struggling to find out what the definition is of -- of a 

report or an investigation. You say it's a substantive 

analysis of facts. Does not the person who processes a

FOIA request have to engage in a substantive analysis of 

facts to determine whether particular documents fall 

within the scope of the request, whether certain 

materials are covered by exemptions?

 MS. SHERRY: I don't think the -- two 

answers to that question. One is I don't think the 

officer engaging in any substantive analysis of the 

facts that are in the records that it's disclosing, but 

the second answer to that question is if that's all 

that's required, then I think we're back to a position 

where every disclosure of information by the government 

would qualify as a public disclosure.

 And we not -- we know that's not the choice 

that Congress made. It included only specifically 

enumerated sources, and it chose particular words. It 

chose report, hearing, audit or investigation. It is 

hard to think of what other words Congress could have 

used to describe the type of report we are talking about 

or the type of investigation besides those words.

 If Congress had wanted to have a broader 

meaning, it had a number of other types of words at its 

disposal. It could have said document, it could have 

said communication, it could have said record, and then 

it would map quite well on to what FOIA is, which is the 

public disclosure of agency records. It didn't do any

JUSTICE BREYER: So what -- why -- imagine 

everything here is the same. That is, what I imagine 

happened here is that an individual wrote and asked for 

a FOIA request. Did Schindler Elevator file a certain 

kind of statement. And you say that's not a report.

 Now, imagine everything the same except the 

person who asks is called Joe Smith, fraud officer for 

the agency. Everything else is the same. Now is it a 

report?

 MS. SHERRY: No, and -- I'm sorry. The 

second circumstance it is, but let me -- I answered that 

incorrectly. The second circumstance it would be, but 

let me explain the distinction.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't understand the 

circumstance.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That is exactly what 

happened here.

 MS. SHERRY: Let me -- that is not -- that's 

what I want to explain, that's not -- that's not what 

happened here. If I submitted a FOIA request and said 

did so-and-so company file a report, I wouldn't get a 

response, that's not a proper FOIA request.

thing, word for word, except the person who makes the 

request is not Mrs. Mary Jones from the public, the 

person who makes the request is the fraud officer for 

the agency that's worried about being defrauded. And 

all I'm interested in is, are they both not reports? Is 

one a report and not the other? Or are they both 

reports?

report if there was an investigation going on.

documents, one, the request, and two the response, which 

is to say, yes, I found 15 reports, they're all signed 

by Mickey Mouse, okay? And he bases a complaint, there

is no such person as Mickey Mouse, it's a fraud, okay? 

Then you go right ahead and bring the qui tam because it 

wasn't falling within the exception.

 Is that right, in the Government's view?

 MS. SHERRY: In the Government's view the 

fact that the information was obtained through a FOIA 

request doesn't answer the question as to whether the 

underlying document is an administrative report or an 

administrative audit or anything else of the sort. The 

FOIA -- the agency's response to a FOIA request, again, 

is nothing more than the first -­

there may be difficult questions at the margin.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not trying to make a 

difficult question. All I want is your enlightenment 

about how when I write these two cases down, should I 

distinguish them? Should I say they're both the same or 

what?

circumstances that's not a report and there was no -­

JUSTICE BREYER: You say in most. In my 

circumstance -­

MS. SHERRY: Oh, sorry. In both 

circumstances.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In both circumstances.

 MS. SHERRY: Then it's not -- it's not a 

report and there's been no investigation. And I think 

words have meaning, and it's significant that FOIA does 

not refer to what an agency does as an investigation. 

It refers to it as a reasonable search for responsive 

records, and this Court has never referred to it as an 

investigation, no court ever has. And that's because 

there's a substantive distinction between an 

investigation, certainly between a GAO investigation, 

between a congressional investigation and what an agency 

does in response to a FOIA request.

 To give an example, the GAO is not subject 

to FOIA, but it does in its regulation respond to 

requests from the public much the same way that an 

agency does in response to a FOIA request. I think it 

would be a rather strange use of the language to think 

of that as a GAO investigation and to think of the

 Another example, and again, we're talking 

about ordinary usage, not any possible usage.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- I don't want to 

have to play these games every time there's -­

there's -- there's one of these qui tam actions. I 

mean, the advantage of Petitioner's solution is that 

it -- it's easy -- it's easy to apply. I don't find 

yours easy to apply at all.

 MS. SHERRY: It may be easy to apply, but 

it's easy to apply and it reads out an entire subset 

enumerated sources that Congress thought important to 

include.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the FCA, the 

amendments in 2009, which are not retroactive, do they 

have any bearing on this problem prospectively?

 MS. SHERRY: On a prospective -- not -- not 

directly in that the words "report," "hearing," "audit" 

or "investigation" are still included, but it did 

narrowly and further define what that means. It added a 

Federal context, and so this Court had decided in Graham 

County that there was no Federal nexus required for the 

second category of documents and going forward with the 

2010 amendments there now is.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Reiss, you have 14 minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN ALAN REISS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. REISS: I don't think I'll use it all, 

Mr. Chief Justice.

 Justice Ginsburg, in response to your 

request, the new version of the False Claims Act lets 

the government disclaim the public disclosure bar. It 

now says the bar can apply unless opposed by the 

government. So the government has an automatic ability 

to stop the imposition of the public disclosure bar 

simply by opposing it. So that is a material change in 

the government's favor that the new False Claims Act has 

made.

 Let me just address an underlying premise 

that we've heard, I think, somewhat repeatedly from the 

Government and Mr. Kirk, and that is this notion that 

FOIA is simply an automatic process, that agencies are a 

publishing house or clearinghouses. That notion is 

utterly belied by the statute and the process itself,

and it's utterly belied by the statistics from the 

Department of Labor in terms of what their responses are 

and how they do them.

 In 2008, which was the last year we were 

able to find statistics for, the Department of Labor, 

the department at issue here, processed 17,000 FOIA 

responses. Only 28 percent were granted in full. 

Thirty-two percent were denied in full, 10 percent, 

based on the statutory exemptions, and 22 percent based 

on other statutes like the Privacy Act, and 40 percent 

of those 17,000 responses were partial responses. So we 

can give you some but not all; and in fact the FOIA 

responses in this very case not only reported that we 

found some of the VETS-100 reports in some years, we 

didn't find them in others; but with respect to the 

VETS-100 reports that were attached, they actually made 

redactions, because those redactions were compelled 

according to the Chief of Compliance and Investigations 

by the Privacy Act.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Reiss, assuming that 

the government did all of the steps you took, how does 

it promote the purposes of FOIA -­

MR. REISS: Very -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to find a document

submitted and contains false statements. How does it 

promote the government's interests to bar an individual 

who has personal knowledge about the falsity from being 

a qui tam action?

 MR. REISS: Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Doesn't that seem 

illogical, meaning the -- the report filed by the 

employer is not screaming out, "I filed a false report." 

You need some outside knowledge from that statement by 

the employer to prove the falsity. So how is your rule 

promoting FOIA's purposes?

 MR. REISS: Well, Justice Sotomayor, in that 

hypothetical the relator actually is bringing 

independent information, and the public disclosure bar 

would not be invoked -- not because the FOIA response 

isn't a report; it wouldn't be invoked because the 

allegations and transactions in the qui tam complaint 

were not based on; they were not disclosed in the FOIA 

response.

 It furthers the purpose of the statute, our 

interpretation furthers the purpose of the statute 

because the purpose of the public disclosure bar was to 

stop qui tam suits from being brought by members of the 

public based on information equally accessible to anyone 

in the public.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm still not sure I 

understand. Here the relator is saying, the statement 

says we complied with the military act, and he says they 

didn't. I have personal information they didn't because 

I know they didn't do X, Y, and Z. Why did we even 

reach the questions we did if what he's claiming is that 

he was an original -- that he has original knowledge not 

-- not reflected in the reports?

 MR. REISS: And what I'm saying, Justice 

Sotomayor is if that's the case, a court can evaluate -­

certainly can evaluate whether he is in fact the 

original source, which would take him out from under the 

public disclosure bar. The court below, the district 

court did that, and found that he wasn't. Or even 

before reaching that inquiry, if a relator can say my 

qui tam complaint is not based upon the public 

disclosure of allegations and transactions and reports, 

the bar doesn't drop.

 Our position is the appropriate place for 

the inquiry that you're worried about is in determining 

whether there is a disclosure of the relator's 

allegations or transactions. Whether -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- to put any kind of 

bar on a relator who is challenging the creation of a 

document that's submitted by an independent party to the 

government.

 MR. REISS: Well, one of the purposes of the 

public disclosure bar was to stop -- and this Court 

recognized it in Graham County -- parasitic lawsuits by 

relators with no real significant independent or 

valuable information to contribute. What we're 

suggesting, as I understand the question -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In fact that's not true. 

We have -- that -- because the Government's right; 

Congress changed the -- the law from anything that was 

in the government's possession and narrowed the scope of 

the bar.

 MR. REISS: Exactly, Justice Sotomayor, but 

our position does not resurrect the government knowledge 

standard that Congress changed in 1986, and it doesn't 

do so for some very good reasons. First of all, the 

government -- the government knowledge standard that the 

Court -- that the Congress changed in 1986 didn't allow 

a relator who is actually the original source of the 

information to bring suit. That was one of the major 

things that prompted the congressional change in 1986.

 Secondly, and it's clear from the

legislative history in the Senate report, one of the 

primary concerns of Congress in enacting the statute in 

1986 was the fact that there was a sense that government 

employees themselves who were knowledgeable about 

potential contracting fraud were not coming forward. In 

fact, the Senate report cites a 1983 survey in which 73 

percent of 5,000 government employees responded they 

would not come forward with evidence of contractor 

fraud. That was a major concern with Congress under the 

old government knowledge standard, the pre-1986 

government knowledge standard. Those -- if those 

employees came forward, the suit would still be barred 

because the government by definition would have known 

about the fraud.

 Under the new statute, not only do you have 

the original source exception, but if government 

employees come forward, they are not barred from 

bringing those qui tam suits. It's a major change and 

it's not the resurrection, Justice Sotomayor, of the 

government knowledge standard.

 If there are no further questions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
