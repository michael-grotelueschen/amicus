3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 09-737, Ortiz v. Jordan.

 Mr. Mills. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID E. MILLS 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. MILLS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court:

 Denial of summary judgment is not reviewable 

11 on appeal after trial, especially where the decision 

12 depends on whether the evidence on the merits of the 

13 claim is sufficient to cross the legal line for 

14 liability. In this case -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry to 

16 interrupt so quickly, but that especially, I take it -­

17 I take it, is a concession that there's a difference 

18 between claims for qualified immunity based on evidence 

19 and claims that are based on law.

 MR. MILLS: Well, there's a difference 

21 between defenses that depend on the evidence at trial. 

22 What I would say about qualified immunity is that, to 

23 the extent any court of appeals is going to enter 

24 judgment based on qualified immunity, it needs to 

understand the conduct of the officials in the case.

1 And so you're always talking about the evidence of that 

2 conduct. 

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, of course there's 

4 always -- there are always facts. There are often 

disputed facts. But suppose the issue is whether or not 

6 this right -- and maybe there are two rights here -­

7 this right was clearly established. That's -- that's an 

8 issue of law. 

9  MR. MILLS: That is -- that is an issue of 

law, Your Honor. 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And doesn't that fall 

12 within the "except" clause that the Chief Justice was 

13 talking to you about, which you haven't had much time to 

14 fill out, I understand.

 But -- well, if you're going to say -- and 

16 it's really not whether the summary judgment is -- is 

17 appealed. That's a little bit -- it's whether or not 

18 the issues resolved by the summary judgment motion are 

19 appealable. I read into your response, or implied from 

your response, what the Chief Justice did, that maybe 

21 sometimes the summary judgment motion, say, on an issue 

22 of law is sufficient to preserve the issue. 

23  MR. MILLS: Well -- and that gets to what I 

24 think is the heart of the split in the circuits and the 

confusion, is that every circuit recognizes a very

Official 

1 general rule that where the evidence at trial moots that 

2 at summary judgment, we're not going to review the 

3 summary judgment decision. 

4  Now, a number of courts said: Well, wait a 

second; there are summary judgment issues that don't 

6 depend on the evidence, and we're -- those are typically 

7 called questions of law. And Respondents point to a 

8 number of good examples in their brief of defenses such 

9 as statute of limitations, pre-emption, and the like, 

that indeed very often don't depend at all on the 

11 evidence at trial. The difference with qualified 

12 immunity is that qualified immunity requires the court 

13 to look at the evidence of the claim itself. 

14  Now, statute of limitations, for example, is 

actually quite different, because in statute of 

16 limitations -- let's suppose Michelle Ortiz filed her 

17 suit 20 years late. It would not matter at all how much 

18 evidence she adduced of the Respondents' misconduct. It 

19 would be barred by statute of limitations.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So Mr. Mills, what then 

21 is the difference? You point out, quite rightly, 

22 summary judgment looks to what evidence there was, and 

23 the question for the court is: What could the plaintiff 

24 prove? When we get past trial, the issue becomes: What 

has the plaintiff proved?

1  So, what was brought out at trial? What was 

2 the record at trial that was larger than the record at 

3 summary judgment? Because if there -- if there was 

4 no -- no new fact presentation, no more ample fact 

presentation, then it wouldn't matter. It would be the 

6 same body of evidence, right? 

7  MR. MILLS: Well, I think that's largely -­

8 largely right, Justice Ginsburg, and here's an example 

9 of what did change in this case.

 At the summary judgment stage, what we had 

11 were affidavits of the Respondents discussing their role 

12 in relation to this case, with no comment whatsoever 

13 about what the consequences would have been had 

14 Ms. Jordan immediately reported the first sexual 

assault. The record was bare at summary judgment from 

16 Respondents' perspective on that -- on that point. 

17  At trial, under cross-examination, 

18 Ms. Bright testified that Respondent Jordan indeed 

19 violated prison policy by not reporting it and then, 

very crucially, also agreed that the second, more 

21 violent assault would have actually been precluded had 

22 that report taken place. 

23  Now, that's -­

24  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, this gets to what 

troubles me about this case. Although the Sixth Circuit 

6

5

25

Official 

1 referred to summary judgment in its opinion, it seems to 

2 me the Sixth Circuit actually reviewed the evidence at 

3 trial and determined that the defendants were entitled 

4 to judgment as a matter of law based on the evidence at 

trial. 

6  So I don't know why this case actually 

7 presents the question on which cert was granted. It 

8 seems to me it presents a question of -- a purely 

9 factual question in the end, whether there was -­

whether judgment as a matter of law was appropriate. 

11 And you never raised the judgment as a matter of law. 

12  You never raised in the court of appeals, as 

13 I understand it, the argument that the defendants' 

14 ability to object to the entry of judgment as a matter 

of law was waived because they never filed a Rule 50(b) 

16 motion. Isn't that right? 

17  MR. MILLS: Well -- well, there's a couple 

18 points in there that I need to address. 

19  First, I think that you are exactly right. 

What the Sixth Circuit did here is it -- it reviewed a 

21 summary judgment decision, but it did peek ahead to the 

22 trial evidence, and it said it was doing that. I think 

23 that highlights the fundamental problem of reviewing 

24 summary judgment after the trial. The Sixth Circuit is 

implicitly recognizing it would be illogical to look at

1 that summary judgment record, those affidavits, and then 

2 ignore this cross-examined testimony of what -­

3  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose we were to 

4 hold that they -- that they couldn't review the denial 

of summary judgment. The case is remanded to them, and 

6 they say: Okay, well, we made a slip of the pen when we 

7 referred to summary judgment in the prior decision. We 

8 really were saying that the defendants were entitled to 

9 judgment as a matter of law, and, although there wasn't 

a Rule 50(b) motion, that was waived because it wasn't 

11 raised on appeal. 

12  So we are -- we come back to exactly where 

13 we are now. All we've done is to correct a slip of 

14 the -- what was arguably a slip of the pen, perhaps 

motivated by their belief that the Rule 50(b) issue is 

16 jurisdictional. But it really is not under our cases 

17 distinguishing between jurisdictional questions and 

18 claims processing questions. 

19  MR. MILLS: And I agree with that last 

point. But here's the problem and here's why it isn't 

21 just simply a slip of the pen that can be fixed by 

22 remanding. Even if this was not summary judgment 

23 whatsoever and it was, as Respondents say, essentially a 

24 Rule 50(a) review, that conflicts with an entire line of 

this Court's decisions leading into Unitherm, which

1 makes clear that the court of appeals absolutely lacks 

2 the power to review the sufficiency of the evidence 

3 where that question wasn't ruled upon by the district 

4 court. And so the court of appeals here, regardless of 

any sort of forfeiture argument, absolutely lacked the 

6 power to consider it. 

7  The additional point about your -­

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not the point 

9 that you've made here. I mean -- and that isn't the 

point on which we granted certiorari. 

11  MR. MILLS: That's right, and I think -- I 

12 think what I just said about the 50(b) point is that I 

13 think it highlights that this really was a summary 

14 judgment review by the Sixth Circuit of -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: Now, Mr. Mills, if I could 

16 just understand your answer to Justice Alito. You 

17 concede that the Sixth Circuit opinion is using the 

18 record built on the whole trial and that that's a 

19 different record from the record that existed at summary 

judgment; is that correct? 

21  MR. MILLS: I do concede it, except to the 

22 extent that I concede they did an adequate review of the 

23 record. But I -- I concede that point. For the example 

24 -- for example -­

1 paragraph where they suggest that they're ruling on a 

2 summary judgment motion. Then they go through an entire 

3 opinion that talks about the facts and the record. And 

4 there are very few citations, but your understanding is 

that when they talk about the facts in the records, 

6 they're talking about the post-trial -- I mean the 

7 record that has been built up as a result of the trial? 

8  MR. MILLS: There are -- there are certainly 

9 a number of instances where they definitely are talking 

about the trial. I do think it -- it is even muddy the 

11 extent to which they are incorporating trial facts 

12 versus summary judgment facts. The example I gave about 

13 this point where Ms. Bright conceded on cross that Ms. 

14 Ortiz indeed would have been separated and the assault, 

second assault, precluded, it's one of two things: 

16 Either the Sixth Circuit's reviewing summary judgment 

17 and picking a couple of trial facts it thinks helps to 

18 review and missing the facts, or it's doing -- it's 

19 looking ahead at these trial facts and because -­

particularly because the district court never weighed in 

21 on that, on a Rule 50(b), it's botching the record. And 

22 it goes to the heart of this Court's cases from Cone 

23 v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper in 1947 up through 

24 Unitherm, which says we have to have the district court 

review the sufficiency of the evidence before the court

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That -- that answer is 

4 not addressing Justice Alito's point, which he said a 

Rule 50 motion is not jurisdictional. You are in 

6 essence claiming it is. You're saying they lacked the 

7 power, but Justice Alito's question to you said they 

8 don't, that they've misread the fact that this is not a 

9 jurisdictional motion. So address that question: Why 

is it jurisdictional as opposed to a claim processing? 

11  MR. MILLS: Your Honor, I -- I am not 

12 disputing that the Sixth Circuit had jurisdiction to 

13 consider the case. But I am making a distinction among 

14 jurisdiction and power, and it's the same distinction 

actually the Tenth Circuit employed in a case called 

16 Williams v. Gonterman, which is cited in our reply 

17 brief; I think it's at page 10. This exact issue came 

18 up, where the verdict loser said: Wait a second; this 

19 issue's been forfeited. The Tenth Circuit, reading 

Unitherm, reading the debate between the majority and 

21 the dissenters, who said plain error and those doctrines 

22 should apply, said: We lack the power to review this; 

23 we have jurisdiction, but we lack the power to -­

1 doesn't lack power. Since you didn't object below to a 

2 -- a argument that Rule 50(b) precluded consideration by 

3 the court of appeals, why wasn't that argument waived 

4 before the court?

 MR. MILLS: It's not waived because, while 

6 the general principle is that claims processing rules 

7 are indeed subject to waiver and forfeiture, this 

8 particular context, as this Court has made clear, that 

9 the word "power" is not an accidental use. It's been 

used in all of these cases. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it -- I mean, 

12 power -- jurisdiction is power, power to proceed in a 

13 case. But we are in an area where there are many, many 

14 cases of this Court that distinguish the Rule 50(a), 

50(b) from the run-of-the-mine claim processing rule 

16 because in the background is the Seventh Amendment 

17 Re-examination Clause. That's the whole reason why 

18 there is this 50(a)-50(b) litany, why the verdict loser 

19 must repeat the 50(a) motion, after -- after the 

verdict. 

21  So I'm surprised that you're using the word 

22 "power." You're not referring to any of that history 

23 which stems from a constitutional provision, the Seventh 

24 Amendment.

 MR. MILLS: Well, Justice Ginsburg, you're

1 absolutely correct, and I think that footnote 4 of 

2 Unitherm goes right to your point. In footnote 4 of 

3 Unitherm, the Court explains that the very reason a 

4 court of appeals lacks the power, lacks the power to 

review that question, is because it is essentially, as 

6 in Unitherm, going to be as a court of appeals reviewing 

7 the conduct -- the sufficiency of the evidence, without 

8 a district court ruling on the question. And this Court 

9 said in Unitherm that that raises serious Seventh 

Amendment concerns. This case is actually a very good 

11 example -­

12  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Mills, I got you 

13 started on this, but this -- none of this is the 

14 question on which we granted review, is it?

 MR. MILLS: Well -­

16  JUSTICE ALITO: We didn't grant review to 

17 decide whether a court of appeals can consider judgment 

18 of a -- judgment as a matter of law where there isn't a 

19 50(b) motion and no argument is made that the -- that 

issue was waived by failing to make the motion. We 

21 didn't grant review on that. 

22  MR. MILLS: And, Justice Alito, that 

23 highlights another important point about this exchange, 

24 and that is that Respondents in the Sixth Circuit did 

not suggest that the Sixth Circuit did have the 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

25

Official 

1 authority to take the summary judgment question and then 

2 look ahead to trial facts. And so, the Sixth Circuit 

3 has taken the summary judgment decision and then acted 

4 without authority to look ahead at the trial facts. And 

so if the argument is that we have forfeited a 

6 pre-emptive argument to the Sixth Circuit that it 

7 couldn't do this frankly very unorthodox approach, I 

8 don't think that that's a proper invocation of 

9 forfeiture even regardless of the point about power.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- are you saying 

11 then that if we explain to the Fifth Circuit -- to the 

12 Sixth Circuit, that the record they must look at is the 

13 trial record, so it's different from the summary 

14 judgment stage, if we told them that, then maybe they 

would look at the evidence differently, even though they 

16 purported to look at the trial evidence? 

17  MR. MILLS: Well, I think if that order were 

18 given, they would indeed do that. But I would still 

19 come back to the point that there is absolutely no basis 

on which they would have the authority to do that. And 

21 the point is, in the Unitherm line of cases, that if you 

22 don't have a district court ruling on the very question, 

23 the question here of whether their conduct, as they say, 

24 crossed a constitutional line, you're circumventing the 

district court's role in the entire process.

1  As this Court has explained repeatedly, a 

2 requisite of a court of appeals reviewing that evidence

4 who has the feel of the case, who saw the witnesses, who 

saw Respondent Bright on cross-examination, first have 

6 the opportunity in the judge's discretion to grant a new 

7 trial -­

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, if you're right, then 

9 there has to be a remand to the Sixth Circuit with 

instructions to send the case back to the district court 

11 to ask the district court what -- whether it thought the 

12 evidence was sufficient? 

13  MR. MILLS: I don't think so, Your Honor. I 

14 think that the best way to see this case is it's indeed 

a review of the summary judgment decision. That's the 

16 only decision by the district court that had to do with 

17 qualified immunity. 

18  The Sixth Circuit expressly invoked an 

19 exception to say: We can review summary judgment after 

the trial because it's qualified immunity; and the 

21 Eighth Circuit said that's okay and we say that's okay; 

22 we're looking ahead at trial facts. 

23  And I think what this Court can and should 

24 conclude is that it's improper to review the summary 

judgment decision after trial because the facts have

1 changed -­

2  JUSTICE ALITO: And your argument is that 

3 where a --the district court denies summary judgment on 

4 a qualified immunity issue that is based even purely on 

an issue of law, there can't be a review unless that's 

6 renewed -- there can't be appellate review unless that 

7 purely legal question is renewed in a Rule 50(b) motion. 

8 That's your -- that's your argument? 

9  MR. MILLS: That is my argument, with a 

couple key pieces -- first of all, they could, of 

11 course, take a collateral order appeal, but if they 

12 proceed to trial -- and here's -- here's sort of the 

13 fundamental point about qualified immunity. Sure, there 

14 are purely legal questions in the qualified immunity 

inquiry. Was the right clearly established? But to 

16 enter judgment, to enter judgment, whether it's the 

17 district court or the court of appeals, that court must 

18 know what the conduct is. 

19  JUSTICE ALITO: But what if the facts are 

utterly undisputed? There's a videotape of exactly what 

21 went on. Nobody has the slightest disagreement about 

22 the facts. The only question is whether the right was 

23 clearly established, and the district court rejects that 

24 at summary judgment. What benefit -- what is the point 

of saying that the defendants have to raise that same

1 issue again in a Rule 50(b) motion? It's utterly a -- a 

2 pointless exercise. 

3  MR. MILLS: Well, it's certainly a less 

4 compelling case than this one where the facts indeed 

change. But I would say that there -- it's not utterly 

6 pointless because the 50(b) motion still invokes all the 

7 protections that this Court has described where the 

8 district court, who had the feel of the case, gets the 

9 first chance to consider whether a new trial should be 

granted -­

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Mills, when -- when 

12 Unitherm talks about the district court feeling the case 

13 and having a feel for the case, it's talking about 

14 having the feel for the evidence and for the facts. The 

whole rationale of Unitherm is based on the evidence, 

16 the facts, not on purely legal questions. 

17  So suppose we disagree with you about the 

18 reach of Unitherm. Suppose we say Unitherm doesn't have 

19 any application to purely legal questions. What would 

that mean for your case? Which part of your claims were 

21 purely legal and which part were instead founded on the 

22 facts, in which case you would have a better Unitherm 

23 argument? 

24  MR. MILLS: It -- it would still mean you'd 

have to reverse in this case, and I think in

1 Justice Alito's hypothetical perhaps, perhaps not. 

2  But in this case, as -- as Respondents 

3 themselves say, the question here is actually very 

4 simple. It's whether their conduct crossed a 

constitutional line. And the point is that, even in the 

6 qualified immunity inquiry, the question is: Does the 

7 conduct -- and that's conduct in one way at summary 

8 judgment and another way at trial -- does that conduct 

9 cross a clearly established constitutional line?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand, 

11 counsel, how your argument -- that in every case you 

12 need to know the facts, every qualified immunity case 

13 you need to know the facts, and those only come out 

14 after trial -- is consistent with our recognizing that 

you can have a collateral order appeals denial of 

16 summary judgment. In other words, you can consider 

17 qualified immunity without knowing how the facts are 

18 going to come out at trial, which is why we allow you to 

19 have an appeal before trial.

 MR. MILLS: You're absolutely right. And at 

21 summary judgment, officers are entitled to invoke 

22 immunity, and they're entitled to take that immediate 

23 appeal. And it's typically -- well, required under 

24 Johnson v. Jones that it be what this Court's called a 

question of law. The defendants assume the facts

9  MR. MILLS: Well, I'm saying it -- it's like 

that case to the extent that the court still has to 

11 understand, if it's going to enter judgment, what the 

12 conduct was. Even if it's looking at purely legal -­

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: No, it doesn't. It doesn't 

14 have to know what it was. It assumes it to be what -­

what the plaintiff claims it was. 

16  MR. MILLS: That's right. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: At the summary judgments, 

18 you give the benefit of the doubt to the plaintiff. 

19  MR. MILLS: That's right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So there's always a factual

17 prison procedures and immediately reported the first 

18 assault. On cross-examination, however, Mrs. Bright, at 

19 page 242 of the trial transcript, said: "The second 

assault, the violent assault, would have been 

21 precluded." 

22  Now, it seems to me, again reading the cold 

23 transcript -­

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -- just finish: 

Because if Ms. Jordan had reported the incident that she

1 was required to, they would have put Ms. Ortiz in 

2 segregation automatically; is that it? 

3  MR. MILLS: Not that they would have put her 

4 in segregation, but that they would have taken steps to 

separate her from the officer, whether that meant 

6 removing the officer from the location or putting her in 

7 another cell. The important piece of that is not only 

8 did it change from summary judgment to trial; the Sixth 

9 Circuit got it entirely wrong.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you have an 

11 obligation in opposing summary judgment to, in your list 

12 of disputed facts or facts that preclude summary 

13 judgment, to put all that in. And why didn't you put 

14 the point you are raising now in the opposition to 

summary judgment? 

16  MR. MILLS: That's not something Ms. Ortiz 

17 would have knowledge of.

was a case to be presented for trial based on the

1 plaintiff's allegations. 

2  MR. MILLS: That's absolutely right. And -­

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but -- but you 

4 may prevail. You may have three different factual 

disputes that the other side is saying are undisputed, 

6 and the fact that you prevail on one doesn't meant that 

7 you didn't have an obligation to put in your opposition 

8 the others. 

9  MR. MILLS: Well, Your Honor, I -- I just 

can't see how Ms. Ortiz would have an obligation to put 

11 in some fact that's outside of her knowledge and, 

12 frankly, something that came out when a Respondent caved 

13 in a bit on cross-examination. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: How would you put the rule 

about when you have to renew a motion? You move for 

16 summary judgment. Can you say this? You've looked up 

17 the treatises and so forth. If the motion for summary 

18 judgment involves either a question of fact or a mixed 

19 question of fact and law, it has to be renewed. If it 

involves neither of the others, neither of those two 

21 things, but it's a pure question of law and not mixed, 

22 it doesn't have to be renewed. 

23  MR. MILLS: I think that's -- that's a fair 

24 way to state it.

3 to me a rule that would make sense. Is it that -- what 

4 do you find related to that? It seems to me that must 

have been thought about before this minute. 

6  MR. MILLS: Well -­

7  JUSTICE BREYER: Not necessarily by you, but 

8 by somebody. 

9  MR. MILLS: Yes, indeed. I think it has 

been thought about. I think it's been thought about 

11 really by every circuit when they recognize the very 

12 basic principle that the real evidence of a case is the 

13 evidence at the trial, and what that means is that, if 

14 the evidence at trial goes to the question at summary 

judgment, whatever that legal issue may be, it's 

16 illogical to ignore exactly what happened at trial and 

17 go back to summary judgment. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but let's imagine it 

19 has nothing to do with qualified immunity.

 MR. MILLS: Yes.

fact it's a pure question of law. But is that the basic 

6 hornbook rule out of this context? 

7  MR. MILLS: Yes, I think it is. I think it 

8 is the basic horn rule -­

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Mills, if that were 

the basic hornbook rule, your claims are all matters of 

11 fact or mixed questions of fact and law? 

12  MR. MILLS: Our claims are mixed questions 

13 of fact and law, yes. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: There are no purely legal 

issues? 

16  MR. MILLS: There are purely legal 

17 components to those inquiries; there's no doubt about 

18 it. Again, a purely legal question might be what is the 

19 constitutional right; is it clearly established?

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's what I'm 

21 asking. I'm asking is -- is -- are the questions that 

22 you have those sorts of questions, or are they factual 

23 inquiries that would fall on the other side of 

24 Justice Breyer's line?

 MR. MILLS: At the end of the day, these are

1 factual inquiries in which you have to understand the 

2 officers' conduct. All I'm saying is that the second 

3 component to establish immunity or anything else does 

4 include always a pure question about whether the right's 

clearly established. But there is no doubt that, to 

6 assess whether that line has been crossed, you have to 

7 understand what the facts are. 

8  JUSTICE ALITO: The -- what's -- determining 

9 what is a mixed question is notoriously difficult. What 

about the -- the situation where the -- the ruling is, 

11 assuming certain facts to be true, the -- the right was 

12 not clearly established? Now, is the fact that certain 

13 facts are assumed to be true enough to make that a mixed 

14 question?

 MR. MILLS: Yes, it is, because that's a 

16 classic sufficiency challenge at Rule 50, to assume 

17 the -- that's what Rule 50 requires. Assume the facts 

18 against you after the verdict's come back and now say,

1 please the Court: 

2  As I think the discussion has already 

3 demonstrated, Ms. Ortiz's question presented hinges on a 

4 false assumption. That assumption is that the Sixth 

Circuit was reviewing the summary judgment order as the 

6 final appealable order in this case. 

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Except that it begins, 

8 2(a), "Although courts normally do not review the denial 

9 of a summary judgment motion after trial on the merits, 

the denial of summary judgment based on qualified 

11 immunity is an exception to this rule." And that's -­

12  MR. MIZER: And -­

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's the opening. That 

14 sets the stage for what follows.

 MR. MIZER: And -­

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, it may be that 

17 everybody, including the Sixth Circuit, misapprehended 

18 the rule because there are some cases that depend on an 

19 assessment of the record and some cases that don't, but 

that's not what the Sixth Circuit said. 

21  MR. MIZER: I think that the Sixth Circuit's 

22 word choice in the sentence that you just read was not 

23 perfectly clear, but -­

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Mizer, you asked 

for an appeal of the summary judgment motion, so they 

26

1 might have chosen their words based on your request. 

2  MR. MIZER: Actually, Your Honor, the 

3 summary judgment motion was only one of several orders 

4 listed in the notice of appeal. And the Sixth Circuit 

brief was very clearly couched as an appeal from the 

6 verdict, which at the bottom of the prior page of the -­

7 of the petition appendix, from where Justice Kennedy 

8 just read, the bottom of page 7a, the Sixth Circuit 

9 calls it an "appeal from the jury verdict."

 And then the Sixth Circuit, at petition 

11 appendix 2a and throughout its opinion, refers to "trial 

12 evidence." 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Mizer, then you 

14 must concede that this opening sentence that 

Justice Kennedy just quoted is wrong. Courts normally 

16 don't review the denial of summary judgment motion after 

17 trial on the merits, but when the summary judgment 

18 denial is based on qualified immunity, there's an 

19 exception.

 MR. MIZER: I think that what the Sixth 

21 Circuit meant there was that the issue of qualified 

22 immunity raised at summary judgment was preserved. I 

23 don't think its word choice was perfectly clear, but I 

24 think other -- other phrases in the Sixth Circuit's 

opinion make clearer that what it was doing was viewing

4 whether it was raised at summary judgment. If you're 

going to look at the evidence at trial, what do we look 

6 at, at trial, to see that the claim of qualified 

7 immunity was preserved? 

8  MR. MIZER: It would -­

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because it's a little 

illogical to -- to say you're reviewing the summary 

11 judgment record when you're not. 

12  MR. MIZER: Well, and I don't think the 

13 Sixth Circuit was saying it was reviewing the summary 

14 judgment record, and that would have been not 

appropriate. What it was doing was looking at the whole 

16 record. And a legal issue doesn't have to be raised 

17 post-trial in order for it to have been adequately -­

18  JUSTICE BREYER: But surely it has to be 

19 raised post-trial if your legal argument is: Look at 

the facts; the facts of this case as proved do not 

21 support liability. 

22  I mean, I would have thought that was a 

23 classic instance where you do have to make the motion. 

24 That's the whole point of having to renew it.

JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? 

6  MR. MIZER: -- and it was -­

7  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, do you normally -­

8 forget this case. What the lawyer says is: Judge, they 

9 are never going to be able to prove that my client 

crossed the intersection. Okay? We go to trial. At 

11 trial, he wants to say: We've heard all the evidence 

12 now, and it doesn't show my client crossed the 

13 intersection, so not liable. Okay? 

14  Doesn't he have to renew it?

 MR. MIZER: In your hypothetical?

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, how is yours one bit 

21 different? Because what you're saying is that the

1 that this Court's case law concerning -- the Mitchell 

2 line of cases concerning collateral order appeals in the 

3 qualified immunity context divides qualified immunity 

4 claims into two halves.

 There are evidentiary sufficiency-based 

6 qualified immunity claims, and there are legal claims. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, that -- that is 

8 right, and I find it, in the context where that already 

9 matters, whether they're appealable as a collateral 

issue already very difficult and complicated to sort 

11 out. Now, what you want us to do is take that 

12 difficulty and continue it on in terms of when you can 

13 appeal and when you can't. 

14  Some qualified immunity claims are purely 

legal. Some are purely factual. Some are in the 

16 middle. Wouldn't it be easier if we just said: Here's 

17 the rule from now on; you've got to renew them all in a 

18 50(b) motion. And that makes it a lot easier for the 

19 trial courts and the appellate courts to figure out when 

they have to -- when they can consider it and when they 

21 can't. 

22  I understand your argument that it makes a 

23 difference. I think it's a good argument, because some 

24 don't depend on the facts. But going forward, it just 

creates an awful lot of difficulty that we don't need to

1 buy into. 

2  MR. MIZER: Well, first of all, I think 

3 that, because it is a difficult question, it should have 

4 been raised by Ms. Ortiz properly, and she hasn't raised 

the 50(b) argument properly. But even if the Court were 

6 to reach it, I think the clearer rule is to map the 

7 Johnson line onto the sufficiency of the evidence line, 

8 otherwise -- for 50(b) motions. Otherwise, then -­

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: The Johnson line isn't much 

of a map, is what the Chief Justice is suggesting. It's 

11 a mess. It's very hard to sort those things out. Why 

12 -- why should we double the difficulty by -- by bringing 

13 it in at the -- at the Rule 50 stage as well? 

14  MR. MIZER: Because the converse rule, Your 

Honor, would create even more difficulties. On 

16 Ms. Ortiz's -­

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? All you have to do -­

19 the close of the evidence. What -- what's the big deal?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And, in fact, you did. 

21 You did move under 50(a). This whole case is here 

22 because apparently -- well, what reason was it that you 

23 didn't make the 50(b) motion? You told the court under 

24 50(a), after all the evidence was in but before the case 

went to the jury, that the jury would not have a legally

1 sufficient evidentiary basis to find for Ms. Ortiz. 

2 That was -- that was your motion. 

3  You were saying: Court, there was no 

4 legally sufficient evidentiary basis. Evidentiary 

basis. That was the motion that you made, recognizing 

6 that the judgment -- the question is whether there is a 

7 sufficient evidentiary basis. 

8  MR. MIZER: And that argument is a different 

9 species of argument than the argument on which -- than 

the -- than the reasoning on which the Sixth Circuit 

11 resolved the case, which is, even assuming all the facts 

12 as given by Ms. Ortiz and taking -- treating those facts 

13 as uncontroverted, still there was not a violation of 

14 clearly established law.

 And under Johnson v. Jones and Mitchell, 

16 that is a different question than from the question of 

17 whether or not particular conduct has been proven. 

18 As -­

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then what you're 

saying is you didn't even -- you didn't need to make the 

21 50(a) motion, that that was just an unnecessary touching 

22 base with Rule 50(a)? Is that what you're saying? 

23  MR. MIZER: That is our position, yes, Your 

24 Honor, because a legal issue is adequately preserved 

once it's pressed and passed on in the district court.

1 And to move for summary judgment on the issue is enough 

2 to preserve a legal claim, the legal claim being not 

3 that particular -- that sufficient evidence exists to 

4 prove that particular conduct occurred, but rather that 

the -- given all of that, that claim as assumed, still, 

6 the Harlow line of objective legal reasonableness has 

7 not been crossed. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But didn't they -­

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose there are some 

cases in which the failure of the court to give a 

11 requested instruction preserves the issue, and perhaps 

12 50(b) is not required there.

14 denied in this case that would have preserved the issue 

for appeal?

18 was not given. We're not arguing that that -­

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What was that 

instruction? 

21  MR. MIZER: The -- the instruction was about 

22 the objective legal reasonableness standard under

24 proper -­

1 the record? 

2  MR. MIZER: I don't have a cite to the 

3 record at the moment. But -- but the -- the point is 

4 that actually, that that instruction wasn't proper, 

because the jury doesn't resolve the Harlow objective 

6 legal reasonableness question. Instead, the jury 

7 resolves the disputed facts, and then the court takes 

8 those facts as a given for purposes of the Harlow 

9 question.

 And -- and, in this case, I think there's an 

11 example of this distinction. There was very much 

12 disputed at trial the question of whether Ms. Ortiz told 

13 Ms. Jordan the name of the guard who had assaulted her. 

14 And that fact was disputed at trial. We -- we didn't 

move for 50(b) over that factual dispute, and so we 

16 couldn't appeal on that question. 

17  But what we did appeal was that, taking that 

18 fact as assumed for purposes of -- of the qualified 

19 immunity question, still qualified immunity was 

warranted. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you -­

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then explain to me what 

23 -- you made a 50(a) motion. Why did you -- was there a 

24 reason for making the 50(a) motion and not following it

1  MR. MIZER: I'm not aware of a reason, Your 

2 Honor. But at pages 4 to 5 of the joint appendix, I 

3 think it's clear that there were two different types of 

4 arguments being made at the 50(a) stage. One argument 

was a dispute over facts. The other argument was, even 

6 if we don't dispute those facts, still Ms. Ortiz's 

7 arguments haven't shown a constitutional violation. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How could you -­

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's -- it's very clear 

from Rule 50 that 50(a) and 50(b) go together, and the 

11 explanation, as I indicated when Petitioner's counsel 

12 was speaking, is the Re-examination Clause of the 

13 Seventh Amendment. So I think every first year 

14 Procedure student learns 50(a), 50(b) go together, and 

there's a historic reason why you must back up a 50(a) 

16 motion with a 50(b) motion. They're not -- they all -­

17 they all ask the same question. The Rule 56, the Rule 

18 50, 50(b), they all ask: Is there sufficient evidence 

19 to warrant a jury finding, whatever. They all ask that, 

but they ask -- ask it on the basis of a different 

21 record: the summary judgment record, the trial record, 

22 and the jury verdict. 

23  MR. MIZER: But still, Your Honor, I think 

24 the question of whether particular conduct has been 

proven is a sufficiency question, and that differs in

question is a separate question. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know of any case

8 with a 50(b) motion depending upon what's in your 50(a) 

9 motion?

 MR. MIZER: I am not aware of any case, no,

12 Enterprises case from the Seventh -- or sorry -- from 

13 the Sixth Circuit, that we cite in our brief, which says

judgment as a matter of law motions under either 50(a) 

16 or 50(b), but that 50(b) is not required with respect to

2  On a due process claim against Ms. Bright, 

3 there are two prongs, I think, to your argument. One is 

4 that, as a matter of law under Sandin, putting her in 

solitary confinement did not violate any -- any 

6 constitutional right. And then there's "she didn't 

7 retaliate" part of your claim. 

8  The two seemed mixed up to me, below. And I 

9 thought in reading your submissions to the district 

court you were saying that, if she retaliated in putting 

11 her in segregated confinement, it doesn't matter whether 

12 there is a Sandin violation or not; she couldn't do the 

13 retaliatory act; is that correct?

law under Sandin, placing an individual in segregated 

6 confinement does not amount to a due process violation 

7 vis-à-vis the -- the ordinary conditions of prison 

8 confinement.

your question about the -- the jury instruction request. 

11 It's in document 84 in the district court record.

14 confinement here. She was shackled, she was ill, and 

nobody attended to her.

24 punitiveness, the Sixth Circuit held that that was not 

preserved -- that claim was not preserved by Ms. Ortiz.

1 And she has not petitioned to this Court for review of 

2 that holding by the Sixth Circuit, and so the only 

3 question is the square Sandin question of whether 

4 segregated confinement is an atypical and significant 

hardship vis-à-vis the routine conditions of -- of her 

6 confinement. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, wouldn't it be 

8 this, the segregated confinement in this case, not at 

9 large?

 MR. MIZER: The -- again, the Sixth 

11 Circuit's holding was that Sandin answered that -- that 

12 question as a matter of clearly established law. And 

13 since Ms. Ortiz hasn't petitioned for review of the 

14 merits of that question, I'm not sure how it's presented 

to this Court. 

16  JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Mizer, is it your 

17 understanding that -- that Unitherm was based on Seventh 

18 Amendment considerations, or was it based on prior 

19 decisions that in turn were grounded on considerations 

of fairness to the verdict-winner, namely the 

21 opportunity, when a -- a motion for judgment as a matter 

22 of law is made after the verdict, to move for dismissal 

23 without prejudice or move for a new trial? 

24  MR. MIZER: I think Unitherm was more 

squarely the latter, although it -- the Court did refer

1 to the Seventh Amendment in responding to Justice 

2 Stevens's dissent. And the Seventh Amendment concerns I

4 established that legal claims like qualified immunity 

are not for the jury to resolve. And so taking -­

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then you're -­

8 you're saying the category -- the mixed claim -- as 

9 Justice Breyer proposed, if it's a purely legal claim, 

then you're right. If it's a mixed claim, then you're 

11 wrong. 

12  MR. MIZER: And I think those -- those 

13 categorizations are -- are fairly slippery and would be 

14 difficult to apply, as I think the Chief Justice 

suggested. And so the guidance that is clear is the 

16 guidance that already exists from Johnson v. Jones, 

17 which is that there are -- there two types of qualified 

18 immunity claims, and if you're assuming the facts to be 

19 true as the plaintiff posits them and you're not 

controverting particular conduct, then you're in the 

21 legal -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but we've been 

6 through this. I think it was Justice Alito who gave the 

7 hypothetical -- suppose that everybody agrees on what 

8 happened; the question is whether or not the right's 

9 clearly established.

 MR. MIZER: And that is this case. 

11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's a pure issue of 

12 law. 

13  MR. MIZER: And, as this Court has called 

14 it, that's correct and that is this case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How is that -­

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, is it this case, Mr. 

17 Mizer? Take the deliberate indifference claim. The 

18 question is whether the conduct amounted to deliberate 

19 indifference. Why is that any different from asking 

whether a particular kind of conduct amounted to 

21 negligence, which in a previous case this Court said you 

22 had did have to make 50(b), a 50(b) motion in order to 

23 preserve? That was in the Johnson v. New York case. 

24  MR. MIZER: It's different, Your Honor, 

because the -- the prong of the analysis in the 

41

25

Official 

1 deliberate indifference conduct that the Sixth Circuit 

2 was looking at was the objective prong of whether or not 

3 the response was reasonable. So assuming all of the 

4 worst of -- of Ms. Jordan's intent, as proven by the 

trial record, and assuming the worst of what she did or 

6 didn't do, still her response was as a legal matter 

7 objectively reasonable, and that was the Sixth Circuit's 

8 holding. 

9  And so, therefore, because that's a legal 

inquiry, there was no 50(b) requirement even if Ms. 

11 Ortiz had preserved the 50(b) argument. 

12  The -- the -- Ms. Ortiz has also posited 

13 that a collateral order appeal is a requirement in order 

14 to preserve a qualified immunity claim. That argument 

is clearly foreclosed not only by the broad agreement 

16 among the circuits but also by this Court's decisions in 

17 United States v. Clark. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. When you go back -­

19 you're the one who has read these cases pretty 

thoroughly, and as I looked at it, I -- with the 

21 incomplete knowledge, I would have thought that 

22 Justice Ginsburg's statement of it is basically right. 

23 What Rule 50 is about is sufficiency of the evidence. 

24 And 50(a) involves we're saying it won't be sufficient. 

And 50(b) involves it wasn't sufficient. Then you could

2  But apparently there's a Second Circuit 

3 case, and some things in the treatises, that says 

4 sometimes Rule 50(a) is being used for some other 

purpose. And that's what seems to be going wrong. Like 

6 if you have a pure question of law, you ought to be 

7 outside 50(a); you ought to be doing some other thing. 

8 You know, a question like: Was there collateral 

9 estoppel that means that he couldn't say he was a 

policeman because they litigated this 4 months ago? 

11 That's a pure question of law. 

12  So, what are these cases and that exception 

13 in the treatise about? What are they thinking of? What 

14 kinds of instances do they think come under 50(a) that 

aren't sufficiency of the evidence? 

16  MR. MIZER: The -- the courts have said that 

17 you had can raise in a judgment as a matter of law 

18 motion legal arguments like the statute of limitations, 

19 collateral estoppel, pre-emption. Very often those will 

be -­

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Suppose we could say 

22 this: That when a lawyer uses 50(a) to make the kind of 

23 motion that does not involve sufficiency of the evidence 

24 but rather, in fact, could be made without 50(a), under 

those circumstances, he doesn't have to say 50(b). How

a legal question. And the parties -­

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the purpose of 

7 50(b) -- Justice Alito brought out that it's not simply 

8 the historical background of the Seventh Amendment, but 

9 in that same line of cases, the Court gave a practical 

reason. And the practical reason related to the 

11 district court, that if the motion is made after the 

12 jury comes in, the district judge would have the 

13 opportunity to exercise her discretion to grant a new 

14 trial.

 Let's take -- is it Ms. Bright -- where the 

16 Sixth Circuit said that, well, maybe there could have 

17 been a retaliation claim, but the plaintiff didn't make 

18 it. The district judge, given the chance, might have 

19 said: I would exercise my discretion to allow the 

plaintiff to have a new trial on this retaliation claim. 

21 I thought it was before -- before the court and it was a 

22 good claim. The Sixth Circuit thought it wasn't. 

23  I mean, the purpose is to get the district 

24 judge into the picture to exercise the district judge's 

discretion on the very question.

1  MR. MIZER: But if a claim is not in a case, 

2 Your Honor, then there's no discretion as to whether or 

3 not to give it to the jury. And so, just as the 

4 qualified immunity question doesn't -- doesn't belong 

with the jury, so, too, a claim that hasn't been 

6 adequately pressed doesn't go to the jury. 

7  And so we're not talking about questions 

8 that should and can be resolved by the jury. We're 

9 talking about legal claims that the jury has no business 

deciding at all. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Your case, anyway, is a 

12 case, judging from what they wrote, which -- I'm back to 

13 where I started -- the mixed questions and the 

14 fact-based questions are you really have to renew your 

motion. And reading your opinion, it seems to me it's 

16 filled with determinations of fact. They're reviewing 

17 what the jury did and could have found, and on the basis 

18 of what they could have found, they say you're not 

19 entitled to -- or you are entitled to qualified 

immunity. 

21  So this would seem like a hornbook case 

22 where you have to make the motion, and if you have to 

23 make the motion, you didn't; and if you didn't, you 

24 don't go back and review the facts as the motion on the

18 order. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Mizer, suppose 

that they were. Suppose they committed an error in that 

21 respect and that they thought they were reviewing the 

22 summary judgment order, and not the final judgment. 

23  If that's what they thought, would you agree

4 rests, is dependent, on our finding that the Sixth 

Circuit was reviewing a final judgment order, which was 

6 not what the Sixth Circuit in fact said it was doing. 

7  MR. MIZER: Again, I would disagree that 

8 that's what the Sixth Circuit said because of the 

9 language at the bottom of page 7a of the petition 

appendix, where they clearly say that it's an appeal 

11 from the verdict. 

12  And so because it's demonstrably not true 

13 that they were treating the summary judgment order as 

14 the final appealable order here, the question presented 

by Ms. Ortiz is not actually presented by this case. 

16 And the further arguments that a 50(b) motion was 

17 required here under Unitherm were never made in the 

18 Sixth Circuit and not made in her opening cert petition. 

19 And so that argument also is not presented by this case.

 And so I think the clear resolution is to 

21 dismiss the case as improvidently granted, but if the 

22 Court were inclined to the view that the merits should 

23 be reached, then the clear rule that we posit resolves 

24 the case, which is that orders made by the district

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you're saying that if

the lower courts, I think, are well-equipped to assess 

16 whether or not an issue has adequately been pressed and 

17 passed on in the district court. 

18  That has been the settled rule of appellate 

19 reviewability, and I don't think that it should be 

changed by imposing a Rule 50(b) requirement for 

21 anything other than a sufficiency of the evidence

8  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID E. MILLS 

9  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. MILLS: Thank you. 

11  The -- one thing that's important about the 

12 Sixth Circuit's language when it said it was reviewing 

13 summary judgment, the single decision it cited was the 

14 Eighth Circuit's decision in Goff v. Bise. Now, in that 

-- in that decision, the Eighth Circuit said, yes, we 

16 can review this after trial even though it was summary 

17 judgment, because it's qualified immunity, but the 

18 Eighth Circuit actually ignored the trial evidence. It 

19 actually did this seemingly illogical step of just 

looking at the summary judgment evidence as-is. 

21  Now, I think what that shows is the Sixth 

22 Circuit was definitely reviewing summary judgment, but 

23 it, implicitly at least, recognized that would be 

24 entirely illogical. So it tied its decision to the only 

decision by the district court on qualified immunity,

1 summary judgment, and said: We've got to look at what 

2 really happened in this case. And so they looked ahead. 

3  Now, the reason the question is adequately 

4 presented is because I think the Sixth Circuit's 

decision shows this entire debate about Unitherm and 

6 whether this was a quasi-50(a) review is the -- one of 

7 the precise reasons the Sixth Circuit hinged its 

8 decision on summary judgment. 

9  I think it was quite aware that an appellate 

court, since at least 1947, in Cone, cannot review the 

11 sufficiency of the evidence at trial and overturn the 

12 jury's verdict. And so the Sixth Circuit said: Wait a 

13 second; we can look to the summary judgment record. 

14 Now -­

17 asked us to take cert on a question presented. What's

 MR. MILLS: Yes. The answer is that a party 

21 may not appeal the denial of summary judgment after 

22 trial. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In no circumstances? 

24  MR. MILLS: I would say that the clearest 

rule is to say in no circumstances. That's the position

1 of the Fourth Circuit. You say, if you want to 

2 challenge a judgment, simply make your motion. 

3  But I would add that whichever way this 

4 Court goes, the decision here has to be reversed, 

because there's no doubt that the legal issue of 

6 qualified immunity at summary judgment depended entirely 

7 on the officers' conduct at trial. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your rule, in 

9 response to Justice Sotomayor, would basically require 

anyone who has an assertion of qualified immunity to 

11 take their collateral appeal or interlocutory appeal. 

12  MR. MILLS: It would only require it, Your 

13 Honor, to the extent that they wish to challenge that 

14 decision on the summary judgment record. I'm not at all 

suggesting that that appeal is required to preserve the 

16 issue of immunity. It's easily preserved, but to the 

17 extent a trial occurs on the officers' conduct -- and 

18 the officers want to say, wait a second, we're still 

19 immune -- that evidence even at trial is insufficient 

for liability. You've got the right to preserve your 

21 immunity issue, but you have to have the district court 

22 consider the question. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they are put to a 

24 choice whether or not their qualified immunity claim

You've got -- I shouldn't say a new case. You've got 

16 new evidence of conduct. And so there's no loss of the 

17 issue of immunity. It's just that it turns on the facts 

18 from the trial.
