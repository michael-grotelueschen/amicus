 Mr. Shanmugam.
 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM
 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 

8  MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you,
 

9 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:


 In Michigan v. Summers, this Court 

11 established a categorical exception to the default 

12 Fourth Amendment requirement of probable cause. 

13  Under Summers, officers executing a search 

14 warrant for contraband may detain individuals they 

encounter at the scene while they are in the course of 

16 executing the warrant. 

17  This case presents the question whether the 

18 Summers exception also permits officers to detain 

19 individuals who have left the scene before the warrant 

is executed. Because individuals who have left the 

21 scene do not pose an immediate threat to the safe and 

22 efficient completion of the search, the court of appeals 

23 erred by permitting their detention absent probable 

24 cause or even individualized suspicion. Its judgment 

should therefore be reversed.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the two tests, 

2 yours seem to be the immediate vicinity test, and the 

3 Second Circuit is as soon as practical test. Your 

4 adversaries point out that the Second Circuit test 

actually focuses on the police officer's conduct, which 

6 should be the focus of reasonableness or 

7 unreasonableness. Your test just creates an artificial 

8 line that is subject to as much play as the other. Why 

9 isn't the focus on police conduct the right focus?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, let me explain, 

11 Justice Sotomayor, first, the sort of theoretical basis 

12 for why we're offering this line, and, second, say a 

13 word about the comparative merits of the two tests. 

14  First of all, with regard to the theoretical 

basis for the line, our fundamental submission to this 

16 Court is that Summers does not create a police 

17 entitlement; it is instead a rule of necessity and 

18 should be confined to situations in which a detention 

19 serves search-related purposes.

 And in our view, the justifications for a 

21 detention evaporate once an individual has left the 

22 immediate vicinity of the premises. And, again, that's 

23 because in those circumstances a detention serves no 

24 interest in ensuring the safe and efficient completion 

of the search because the individual poses no immediate

1 threat to the safe and efficient completion of the
 

2 search.
 

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: And what is the immediate
 

4 vicinity? How would you define that?


 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, ordinarily, the
 

6 immediate vicinity will be the physical bounds of the
 

7 property; but, there may be circumstances in which an
 

8 individual who is just outside the physical bounds of
 

9 the property should nevertheless be detained, so to
 

provide --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: May be? There certainly 

12 is. I mean, that was Summers, wasn't it? 

13  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, in Summers itself, the 

14 individual was on the premises just outside the house 

that was going to be searched, and the officers were, in 

16 the government's words in that case, approaching the 

17 property. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. He wasn't on the 

19 premises, he was on the sidewalk, right?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, he was actually on --

21 he was on the property because he was on a sidewalk that 

22 connected the front steps to the public sidewalk in 

23 front of the house. The officers were approaching the 

24 house, about to effectuate entry.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He was in the curtilage of

1 the house. 

2  MR. SHANMUGAM: He was pretty clearly within 

3 the curtilage, Justice Scalia. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You said the 

difference is there's no immediate threat to the 

6 officers here. But there is a threat, I suppose, I 

7 mean, if he finds out about the search and comes back, 

8 if he sees the officers outside his dwelling, if there's 

9 somebody in the dwelling who can notify him, send him a 

message that the police are searching and he can get his 

11 confederates and come back. 

12  It seems to me that you're requiring that 

13 there be a larger number of police present at the site 

14 conducting the search, being lookouts for anybody that 

might come back, being able to detain people who are 

16 leaving as they approach. There's no immediate threat, 

17 but there's certainly a threat. 

18  MR. SHANMUGAM: If anything, it's the 

19 government's approach that requires a greater number of 

officers at the site because, under the government's 

21 approach, you have the two officers who conduct the 

22 detention while a separate group of officers execute the 

23 search. 

24  And it's really for that reason, 

Justice Scalia --

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it requires 

2 more unless they want the guy to get away, I guess, 

3 right? 

4  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, let me say something 

about this prospect that the individual will return. We 

6 think that the appropriate analysis here is the analysis 

7 that this Court set out in Arizona v. Gant. 

8  And this Court, in Arizona v. Gant, 

9 suggested that where a categorical rule is involved, you 

have to look at the class of cases to which the rule 

11 would be extended to see if the justifications apply. 

12  Now, with regard to this class of 

13 individuals who have left the scene, we believe that it 

14 is simply unlikely either that such an individual who 

has left the scene will be aware of the presence of 

16 police, or that such an individual will return in an 

17 effort to disrupt the search. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, what if he were aware, 

19 or what if there was reason to think he might be aware, 

would you then allow the police to do what the police 

21 did here? 

22  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we wouldn't. And 

23 that's simply because we believe that this should be a 

24 categorical analysis.

 And so, again, you're looking at this entire 

7

25

Official 

1 class of cases where individuals have left the scene to 

2 determine whether the justifications for the Summers 

3 rule apply. 

4  Now, let me provide a --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- if you think that 

6 leaving the scene -- in Justice Kagan's hypothetical, 

7 that he's leaving the scene with incriminating evidence, 

8 at that point you have -- you have a Terry stop? And 

9 he's right at the scene; he's just leaving the premises, 

at the end of the driveway or something? 

11  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, the analysis under 

12 Terry is whether there is reasonable suspicion, a 

13 reasonable basis to believe that the individual is 

14 engaged in criminal activity --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What would you think 

16 generally in my hypothetical? There'd be hundreds of 

17 other facts, but --

18  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, ordinarily, when an 

19 individual is seen leaving the scene -- and suppose --

let me provide --

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just -- just before the 

22 search, yes. 

23  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, of course, the 

24 individual who is leaving the scene doesn't necessarily 

know that the search is about to take place.

Official 

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. 

2  MR. SHANMUGAM: And so, to provide a 

3 hypothetical that will hopefully put some meat on the 

4 bones of this issue, suppose that an individual leaves a 

house, and he actually sees police officers sitting in a 

6 car, whether marked or unmarked, outside the house. And 

7 it is clear that he has seen the officers. He waves at 

8 the officers and then ambles down the street. 

9  I don't think that there would be any doubt 

but that that individual could not be detained unless he 

11 did something more; unless, for instance, he engaged in 

12 flight at that point, at which point he could perhaps be 

13 detained under Terry. 

14  And so we simply submit that the analysis 

should be no different in a situation in which the 

16 purpose -- the reason why the officers are sitting 

17 outside the house is because another group of officers 

18 is about to execute the search warrant. 

19  Of course, that individual --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Terry -- Terry is an 

21 open question in this case. It wasn't decided below, 

22 but it was raised. 

23  So -- so you're arguing we shouldn't extend 

24 Summers, but that leaves this very case susceptible to 

the assertion that this was a legitimate Terry stop.

25

Official 

1  MR. SHANMUGAM: That is correct, 

2 Justice Ginsburg. 

3  And just to be clear about how these two 

4 doctrines work together, our submission to this Court is 

that within the search zone, within the immediate 

6 vicinity of the premises, the rule of Summers applies, 

7 so that, if officers encounter an individual within that 

8 zone while they are in the process of executing the 

9 warrant, a detention is permissible absent probable 

cause or individualized suspicion. 

11  Outside that search zone, ordinary 

12 Fourth Amendment principles apply. And, of course, 

13 under the Fourth Amendment, detentions of persons have 

14 to be justified by some degree of individualized 

suspicion; probable cause for a full-fledged arrest, 

16 individualized suspicion for a more limited detention 

17 under Terry. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what would you think 

19 of this situation? Officers have a no-knock warrant, 

and they're -- they're at the house. They see somebody 

21 come out the door and start to go down the steps, 

22 doesn't look like that person has noticed their 

23 presence. 

24  Now, they have the choice, if you prevail, 

of either rushing in and stopping the person within the 

10
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 curtilage, in which case they could detain the person, 

2 or they could allow the person to walk some distance 

3 outside of the site of the house and then stop the 

4 person, and that would allow them to execute the warrant 

without endanger -- without enhancing the danger to them 

6 from potentially armed people inside or allowing the 

7 destruction of evidence. 

8  What -- in that situation, what argues in 

9 favor of your rule, that if they want to detain this 

individual, they have to rush in and stop him before he 

11 leaves the premises? 

12  MR. SHANMUGAM: The justifications 

13 articulated by this Court in Summers, Justice Alito, and 

14 in particular what we really believe are the primary 

justifications, first, minimizing the risk of harm to 

16 officers executing the warrant; and, second, 

17 facilitating the orderly completion of the search. 

18  And let me say a word about --

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, without 

interrupting -- in that situation, officer safety is 

21 undermined by your rule because it requires them to stop 

22 the person on the premises and, therefore, tip off those 

23 inside, potentially, about their presence. 

24  MR. SHANMUGAM: But they also have the 

choice not to engage in a detention at all. 

11

25

Official 

1  And I think the fundamental problem with the 

2 court of appeals' rule and with the government's 

3 submission to this Court is that it really entails the 

4 conclusion that once officers see the individual leaving 

the house, they have an entitlement to detain that 

6 individual, with the only open question being where and 

7 how they go about effectuating the detention. 

8  But we simply believe that the 

9 justifications for the detention don't attach to the 

individual. They are search-based justifications. And 

11 the mere fact that an individual is seen leaving a house 

12 that is about to be searched in our view is insufficient 

13 to give rise to reasonable suspicion. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Shanmugam, when you talk 

about the justifications in your brief and just now, you 

16 talk about two; but, there were, in fact, three, and the 

17 third was flight. So how is it that that's dropped from 

18 your understanding of Summers? 

19  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we simply think, 

Justice Kagan, that that justification is insufficient 

21 standing on its own. And that is simply because the 

22 justification in preventing flight is different in kind 

23 from the other two justifications that we've been 

24 discussing.

 The other two justifications are truly 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 special law enforcement interests, to use this Court's 

2 words in Summers. The interest in preventing flight, by 

3 contrast, is an ordinary law enforcement interest. 

4  And just as in my hypothetical, when the 

officers are sitting outside and they see an individual 

6 wander by, the mere fact that the individual saw the 

7 police and perhaps would therefore conclude that the 

8 police were on to him would not give rise to a basis for 

9 detention simply because that individual could 

subsequently flee. 

11  So, too, we think that preventing flight in 

12 and of itself is insufficient. That is the ordinary law 

13 enforcement interest that requires individualized 

14 suspicion.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I come back 

16 to the facts that my colleagues have raised and break it 

17 down implicating the Terry question? 

18  Here, the officers had a report of something 

19 in the house, and they saw the defendant -- two people 

leaving. 

21  I know Terry hasn't been decided, but why do 

22 you think -- just the stop, not the detention, not the 

23 bringing them back to the house, why do you think that 

24 just stopping them was wrong?

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Under Terry?

Official 

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under Terry. 

2  MR. SHANMUGAM: Sure. Well, and first of 

3 all, I should preface what I'm about to say by noting 

4 that the court of appeals itself didn't reach the Terry 

issue, and the government doesn't advance that issue in 

6 its merits brief. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the court below did. 

8  MR. SHANMUGAM: So that would be an issue 

9 that would be open on remand. And let me say why on 

remand --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. Just the 

12 stop would be -- but -- but they did more than just stop 

13 them. They --

14  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that's right. The 

stop and the --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- they handcuffed them. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it goes back to if 

18 a police officer saw an individual leaving the house and 

19 was concerned about them tipping someone off, et cetera, 

what would be the problem with the officer stopping the 

21 person around the corner, holding them, making sure 

22 people got in and then letting them go. 

23  MR. SHANMUGAM: And just to be clear, 

24 because there are the two separate issues. There's the 

question of the stop and the question of the detention. 

14
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1 And there would be a separate question about whether 

2 under Terry a detention of a particular length might or 

3 might not be permissible. 

4  But as to the stop, the argument that we 

would make on remand if we were to prevail before this 

6 Court would be that here what you have is insufficient 

7 to meet the reasonable suspicion standard. And what I 

8 assume that the government would argue is that the 

9 combination of the search warrant and the fact that the 

individual was seen leaving the premises that were about 

11 to be searched, and as to which there was probable cause 

12 to believe that contraband was present, and the fact 

13 that my client met the extremely generic description 

14 provided by the confidential informant, would be 

sufficient to give rise to reasonable suspicion. 

16  Now, clearly we don't think -- I was just 

17 going to say, clearly we don't think that either of 

18 those factors standing on its own would be sufficient. 

19 The question would be whether that combination of 

factors under the facts and circumstances of this case 

21 would be sufficient, and we would submit that that 

22 combination is insufficient as well. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: If they did do -- if they 

24 did do a Terry stop, and in the process of that stop the 

police officer got a call that said, we found lots of

1 contraband, guns in this house, at that point they could 

2 have turned the Terry stop into an arrest, couldn't 

3 they? 

4  MR. SHANMUGAM: They could very well, with 

one caveat, and that caveat is simply that the 

6 circumstances under which the contraband is found might 

7 be relevant to the analysis of whether or not there is 

8 probable cause, because the question would be whether or 

9 not there is probable cause to believe that the 

individual constructively possessed the contraband at 

11 issue. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Shanmugam, please help 

13 me. I -- I don't understand why -- why the Terry stop 

14 is at issue, inasmuch as there was not a Terry stop. I 

mean, what occurred here went well beyond a Terry stop, 

16 did it not? So what do you do? You -- you slice the 

17 baloney that thin; you say well, the -- the first stop 

18 is a Terry stop. Oh, yes, he later went on to detain 

19 them for a long time and put handcuffs on them and take 

them back to the premises. What -- what relevance does 

21 the Terry stop have? 

22  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, that would be the 

23 additional question, whether the detention in this case, 

24 which did involve taking my client and the other 

individual, putting them in handcuffs, putting them in

1 the patrol car, and then taking them back to the scene, 

2 was permissible within the scope of a Terry stop. And I 

3 think that would also be an open question, and that 

4 would particularly be an open question in a number of 

these cases in which the detention, pursuant seemingly 

6 to Summers, occurs over a very lengthy period of time. 

7 Under Terry, of course --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I guess -- I guess, I 

9 just didn't realize that it's an open question whether 

you can do that much in -- in a mere Terry stop. 

11  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, under Terry officers 

12 may detain an individual for the period of time it takes 

13 for them to confirm or dispel the suspicion, and I think 

14 that there would be an open question as to whether or 

not when officers are executing a search warrant, for 

16 the duration of the execution of the search warrant, 

17 that falls within the scope of that Terry test. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Could you explain what you 

19 mean by the immediate vicinity? Is it based on -- on 

property line? Is it some absolute distance from the --

21 the entrance to the premises? Is it based on how far 

22 you could see from the -- the site of the search? 

23  MR. SHANMUGAM: I think ordinarily it will 

24 be within the physical bounds of the property. So --

but -- but if, for instance, officers saw an individual

1 coming out of his house and he walked out and he just 

2 happened to step -- step off the curb into the road 

3 before the officers got to them, we would say that that 

4 would satisfy the immediate vicinity standard.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, physical bounds of 

6 the property is -- is too much. I mean, you know, what 

7 if it's a farm and it's a 50-acre farm? 

8  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, and the point of --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you are much better 

off, I think your submissions sometimes say immediate 

11 vicinity. 

12  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we -- we proposed to 

13 this Court the immediate vicinity standard in large part 

14 because it really is comparable to similar limits this 

Court has adopted for other Fourth Amendment --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: I like that much better 

17 than boundaries of the property. 

18  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well -- and to provide a 

19 couple of examples, under Maryland v. Buie, the case 

that permits officers to conduct a protective sweep 

21 incident to an arrest, the Court permits officers to 

22 search the area immediately adjoining the place where 

23 the arrest occurs and that has not proven to be a 

24 difficult standard to apply in practice.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the actual 

18

Official 

1 difference? I mean, you have two officers or three. If 

2 they go into the property and somebody's there, they can 

3 detain him, and Summers gives three reasons: One, as 

4 Justice Kagan pointed out, preventing flight in the 

event that incriminating evidence is found. We are 

6 considering now the case where, instead of going and 

7 detaining the people, the people inside the house walk 

8 out and there are two officers in a patrol car or an 

9 unmarked car outside waiting to go in. Okay. That 

seems to me identical, as you said. 

11  The last one is facilitating orderly 

12 completion of the search. That seems to me identical. 

13 You want the person there so that he can open a drawer, 

14 so he can unlock a closet, et cetera, okay. Identical.

 The third one, where there is the only place 

16 for difference, it seems to me, is minimizing the risk 

17 of harm to the officers. Now, the harm, risk of harm to 

18 the officers I guess if he goes into the house is that, 

19 well, if they leave, they might come back, goodness 

knows, and they've seen they are looking for the drugs, 

21 da, da, da. Or maybe they will rush out, or maybe there 

22 will be a -- well, any, goodness knows what. 

23  Now here I can see a slight difference, but 

24 maybe not. I don't know. Maybe they will come back. 

Maybe they noticed the people in the car outside. Maybe

1 they didn't. Certainly the policemen don't know. And 

2 they might go in quicker, and then the others will be 

3 alerted. I mean, when you talk generally about a risk 

4 of harm to the police, it seems to me pretty close, if 

not identical. 

6  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well -- well, let me --

7  JUSTICE BREYER: So what am I missing? 

8  MR. SHANMUGAM: Let me address each of those 

9 three.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You already said the first 

11 one's identical. I don't see how the third one could 

12 change, and what about the second? 

13  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I actually don't think 

14 that even the first one is identical. But look, we 

think that first and foremost, the interest in ensuring 

16 officer safety is really the paramount interest here, 

17 and we simply think that it is unlikely that an 

18 individual who is seen leaving the scene is either going 

19 to be aware of the presence of police or return to 

disrupt the search. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: How do you know that? They 

22 are sitting outside in the car. 

23  MR. SHANMUGAM: The government has not 

24 identified a single example of an individual who is seen 

leaving the scene who has returned to disrupt the search

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought your better 

3 answer was the risk of somebody coming back to a house 

4 exists whether the person just left it or left it an 

hour after or before or 2 hours or 24. 

6  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, and that was going to 

7 be --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: When the police walk in, 

9 they always have to guard against reentry.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, and that was going to 

11 be my next point, Justice Sotomayor; and the government 

12 really tries to make a broader and more ambitious 

13 argument. The government tries to make the argument 

14 that an individual with a connection to the place to be 

searched could arrive at the scene while the search is 

16 ongoing, really regardless of whether that individual 

17 was aware of the presence of police, and then seek to 

18 disrupt the search. 

19  Now, we think even as to that broader 

category of cases the government hasn't made a 

21 sufficient showing that those sorts of confrontations 

22 are a common occurrence, particularly in light of the 

23 routine precautions --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: It's not just that. It's 

that they might want to get in quicker to stop this

1 person from leaving because he's the one who knows where 

2 the drugs are. At least that's what they think. Or 

3 they start to shout, and alert the others. Or -- I 

4 mean, I have never conducted such a search, you know, so 

I don't know the risks involved there, but I can see the 

6 possibilities. And probably you might have conducted 

7 them, but I don't know. So how am I supposed to answer 

8 this question? 

9  MR. SHANMUGAM: I haven't personally 

conducted any searches, Justice Breyer. But I can say 

11 that with regard to categorical rules it is really 

12 incumbent on the government to make a showing as to why 

13 an extension of a categorical rule is required. Because 

14 after all --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We talked about --

16 we talked about officer safety. What about the safety 

17 of others? Suppose the place being searched is adjacent 

18 to a playground and there are, you know, dozens of 

19 children playing in the playground. The police are 

worried there would be a shootout and they want to 

21 detain the person, so they say: Well, let's wait until 

22 he gets a block down the street and detain him there for 

23 the safety of the kids. That has -- they can't do that? 

24  MR. SHANMUGAM: Officers will naturally take 

precautions in situations like that. They will go in

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, the precaution 

3 is let's wait until he's a block down the street because 

4 it will be a lot safer. Can they do that and be covered 

by Summers or not? 

6  MR. SHANMUGAM: They cannot be covered by 

7 Summers, but what they can do is either follow the 

8 individual for the period of time during which they are 

9 executing the warrant, or they can detain that 

individual if he returns to the scene. 

11  And again, all of the examples that the 

12 government cites -- and there aren't that many of 

13 them -- but the examples that the government cites are 

14 examples of individuals who arrive at the scene and when 

they realize that their place of residence is being 

16 searched, they become obstreperous; and to the extent 

17 that there is a concern about the threat posed to the 

18 safety of officers in those circumstances, we would 

19 submit that the obvious solution is to make clear that 

Summers permits the detention of individuals who arrive 

21 at the scene; and officers routinely do establish 

22 perimeters when they are executing search warrants. And 

23 so when they --

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if he came back -- I 

mean, the scenario here is he was supposed to be driving

1 his friend home, and he would have come back while the 

2 search was ongoing, but the police could apprehend 

3 anyone while the search -- if that's what you're saying, 

4 while the search is ongoing --

MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, if he were to return 

6 to the scene while the search is ongoing, we believe 

7 that he could be detained pursuant to Summers, and we 

8 cite a number of court of appeals cases that have so 

9 held.

 What the government is really arguing for 

11 here is an even more ambitious rule, an additional layer 

12 of Fourth Amendment prophylaxis, if you will, that 

13 permits officers to detain an individual who is seen 

14 leaving the scene based on the possibility that they are 

going to return. The government has not come even close 

16 to making an empirical case as to why that additional 

17 layer of prophylaxis is required. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if the person 

19 comes out the door and walks -- and has walked 50 feet 

down the block within sight of the entrance at the time 

21 when the police are entering to make the arrest? Would 

22 that person be in the immediate vicinity? 

23  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, I think that the 

24 natural limit on the immediate vicinity rule is imposed 

by the underlying justification, namely, that officers 

24

25

Official 

1 should have the authority to encounter individuals -- to 

2 detain individuals they encounter while they are in the 

3 course of executing the warrant. 

4  And so if in your hypothetical, 

Justice Alito, the search team is marching up to the 

6 house, and they encounter the individual 50 feet away 

7 from the door or the property line while they are in the 

8 course of doing so, the justifications of Summers kick 

9 in at that point. That individual is aware of the fact 

that the police are about to search his house, and, as 

11 such, that individual poses a threat to the safe and 

12 efficient completion of the search. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, does that mean that if 

14 the person is within sight of the entrance to the 

premises at the time when the police enter, then that 

16 person can be searched --

17  MR. SHANMUGAM: Well, we don't think --

18  JUSTICE ALITO: -- and be detained. 

19  MR. SHANMUGAM: We don't think that that's 

necessarily a line of sight rule. So if you had an 

21 individual who was sitting out in front of a house six 

22 doors down, we don't think that that individual could be 

23 detained. Of course, in this case, my client was 

24 detained at least seven-tenths of a mile away --

1  MR. SHANMUGAM: -- so the issue --

2  JUSTICE BREYER: That's the problem. The 

3 police have to know what they're supposed to do when 

4 they go in to search a house, all right? And they know 

that sometimes they can keep the people there, and you 

6 are saying, but they can't stop them from leaving if 

7 they're not -- all of a sudden, I'm a policeman, and I 

8 don't know what to do exactly because I don't know how 

9 to fill in that blank. And therefore, I might rush 

in -- I don't know -- I see a recipe for a mess, and 

11 that's what -- and the mess could involve physical harm, 

12 and --

13  MR. SHANMUGAM: You're missing the --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: You're not saying that they 

can't stop them from leaving. Have you said that; they 

16 can't stop them from leaving? 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: They can't stop them from 

18 leaving if, blank. 

19  MR. SHANMUGAM: They -- they could always 

proceed to execute the warrant when they see an 

21 individual leaving; and, if they are in the course of 

22 executing the warrant, a detention is permissible. 

23  But let me say just one word about the issue 

24 of the administrability of the rule because, after all, 

what we're talking about here is a bright-line rule.

1 And the very purpose of a Fourth Amendment bright-line 

2 rule is to provide guidance to courts and officers 

3 alike. 

4  It is true that one can posit difficult 

hypotheticals under our immediate vicinity standard; 

6 but, it is also true that it is even easier to posit 

7 difficult hypotheticals under the as soon as reasonably 

8 practicable standard that the government advances, which 

9 really reintroduces the very case-by-case analysis that 

bright-line rules are designed to avoid. 

11  And, in addition, it is entirely unclear to 

12 us what Fourth Amendment purpose that limitation serves 

13 because it is not clear to us why it matters for Fourth 

14 Amendment purposes how quickly officers effectuate the 

detention. 

16  And just one last point that I'd like to 

17 make before reserving the balance of my time for 

18 rebuttal. 

19  The rule that the government seems to be 

advocating before this Court is really a much more 

21 ambitious rule than we've even been discussing this 

22 morning. The government seems to suggest that the 

23 government has the authority to detain any individual 

24 with a connection to the place to be searched. And I 

think that that is out of recognition that an individual

6 Summers.

8 my time.

11  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL 

12  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

13  MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

14 please the Court:

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Wall, would you 

16 answer -- direct your first response to that last issue 

17 because, as I read your brief, you seem not to be 

18 accepting the Second Circuit's rule at all. You seem to 

19 be proposing what appears to me to be a much broader 

rule that says -- at one point in your brief you state 

21 that it is the occupant's observed connection to a home 

22 subject to a valid warrant, not his physical location at 

23 the time that he is detained, that makes him subject to 

24 detention.

 Now, I know police when they're executing

1 warrants often have an advance team that has been 

2 surveilling a home, sometimes for days. And they've got 

3 one officer sitting there, and they see who they think 

4 is the occupant leave, and the team doesn't arrive till 

12 hours later. 

6  Is it your position that in that 

7 circumstance the officers are authorized to go to 

8 wherever the defend -- wherever the occupant is, the 

9 office, the -- wherever he might be, his mother's home, 

and effect an arrest there? 

11  MR. WALL: No, Justice Sotomayor. I 

12 appreciate the opportunity to start there because I 

13 think Petitioner's reply brief and much of his argument 

14 today is devoted to a position the government's not 

taking. 

16  So let me be very clear. In the 

17 government's view, Summers is about current and recent 

18 occupants, people whom police, when they are executing 

19 the warrant, find at the home or see leaving the home in 

the process of executing a warrant. 

21  And the question here is do the 

22 justifications apply equally as a departing occupant 

23 steps away from the home and onto a sidewalk, a yard, a 

24 couple blocks away.

 And I think my friend's answer to that has a 

29

25

Official 

1 wonderfully abstract quality to it that doesn't engage 

2 any of the realities on the ground. 

3  Justice Alito, your hypothetical is anything 

4 but. It comes very close to the facts of the Cochran 

case out of the Sixth Circuit. Police arrive at the 

6 scene. The occupant is known to carry a gun, and he has 

7 a guard dog.  So, rather than walk up to the door, they 

8 wait for him to leave; but, by the time they can catch 

9 up to him, he's off of the bounds of the property, but 

he's still very close to the residence. They stop him. 

11 They take him back to the residence. He lets the 

12 officers in. He secures the dog, and they complete the 

13 search. 

14  I think that is a model law enforcement 

practice, and it is indistinguishable in any important 

16 respect from what went on in Summers. 

17  The justifications for detention apply 

18 equally to departing occupants when they are seen by 

19 officers leaving in the process of executing the 

warrant. 

21  But no, Justice Sotomayor, the government is 

22 not contending that other connections to the residence, 

23 other than that kind of observed connection by the 

24 officers, could justify a detention under Summers.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we don't have

1 anything like that in this case. We have them getting 

2 into a car, driving almost a mile away and being stopped 

3 at that point. 

4  MR. WALL: Well, we do have, though, the 

officers seeing him departing the residence as they're 

6 executing the warrant. It's a no-knock warrant for a 

7 gun. And rather than stop him right outside the house 

8 because they don't know who else would be inside --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As they're executing 

the warrant, I don't remember, was the -- did the 

11 individual know that they were executing the warrant in 

12 this case? 

13  MR. WALL: No. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, okay.

 MR. WALL: They had obtained the warrant. 

16 They had -- the team had --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the danger to 

18 them is not at all like the situation with the dog and 

19 the armed guy just off the property.

 MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, I respectfully 

21 disagree. And the government would be happy to have 

22 this case decided by having the Court look at the 

23 Federal and state cases, look at the risks that are 

24 present in those cases, and deciding whether the 

interests of Summers are served in those cases.

1  What we see in the cases is that -- take 

2 this very case, for instance. Petitioner is driving his 

3 friend home to meet a court-imposed probation curfew, 

4 and he is then returning to the house. I think the 

reasonable inference in the record is that he'll be back 

6 in a matter of minutes. So he --

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then Mr. Shanmugam 

8 says they could stop him. They could stop anybody. The 

9 search is ongoing. Somebody approaches the house; the 

police can stop that person. 

11  MR. WALL: But think how formalistic and odd 

12 that is, Justice Ginsburg, that the police see someone 

13 leaving, but, if they can't catch up to them on the 

14 bounds of the property, which has no reasonable 

relationship to the warrant here, which was for the 

16 premises, not for the -- for that property --

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: The threat is from anybody 

19 coming back to the house, not just the person who just 

left. 

21  MR. WALL: Oh, assuming --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: And surely the police, when 

23 they're conducting a search, post guards to prevent 

24 people from coming in.

 MR. WALL: They often do, Justice Scalia,

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume they always do. 

3 It seems to me there's no special threat from the person 

4 who -- who left the house. There's always a threat of 

somebody else coming into the house. 

6  MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, certainly in 

7 urban areas they do. I think it's more difficult where 

8 you have smaller police departments in rural areas. 

9  But the government's not disputing that 

posting sentries is a good idea. That doesn't begin to 

11 take care of the most serious cases, where people 

12 outside of the area of the search fire on or assault 

13 officers. 

14  So, for instance, in 2008 --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're missing the 

16 point, which is that's going to happen regardless, 

17 meaning that risk exists whether the person left the 

18 minute you got there or a minute before or an hour 

19 before or two hours before. That's the whole point, 

which is the risk is extant no matter what. 

21  MR. WALL: Justice Sotomayor, there is no 

22 question that executing a warrant is dangerous, and 

23 people can come onto the scene at any time. 

24  The question is, do we want to increase that 

risk to officers? Here, Petitioner is leaving, he'll be

1 back in a matter of minutes, and they're searching for 

2 guns. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you didn't know --

4 you don't know that in any search, meaning any time you 

do a search you have no idea when the -- whether the 

6 occupant -- sometimes you know whether the occupant is 

7 inside. You'll hear the TV or something else. But 

8 often you don't, and you don't know if someone will come 

9 back and when.

 MR. WALL: Justice Sotomayor, I completely 

11 agree, although I think that --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why is seeing someone 

13 leaving increasing that risk? 

14  MR. WALL: Because we know that some 

percentage of those people will come back. Some 

16 percentage will flee, which is one of the interests in 

17 Summers, which I think Petitioner does not take 

18 seriously. But some percentage of them will come back 

19 and some percentage of those returning occupants will 

harm officers. And unfortunately --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if you have a large 

22 enough force that you can afford to send two of them in 

23 a car chasing this fellow for a mile, why can't you just 

24 post those two outside the house, just in case somebody, 

whether it's this person who's just left or anybody

2 that what your positing is -- is -- is unlikely, namely, 

3 having -- having sufficient personnel to follow these 

4 persons, but not having sufficient personnel to defend 

the premises against somebody entering. 

6  MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, first, that isn't 

7 even arguably going to serve two of the three Summers 

8 interests, preventing people from fleeing or garnering 

9 their assistance in the orderly completion of the 

search. But even if we --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can you tell me what 

12 constitutional right entitles you to stop someone from, 

13 using the word, "fleeing"? You certainly are entitled 

14 to stop someone with whom you have reasonable suspicion. 

But what constitutional right entitles you to stop a 

16 person who's just leaving in the normal act, without 

17 reasonable suspicion? 

18  MR. WALL: Justice Sotomayor, I think your 

19 question fills in the answer. What the Court said in 

Summers is when you see someone -- when you find someone 

21 at a home or you see them leaving at a time when a 

22 neutral magistrate has determined there's probable cause 

23 to believe a crime is being committed inside, you have, 

24 in the words of the Summers Court, "articulable and 

individualized suspicion" to believe that that person is

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Wall, you have 

3 that, too, about the person in her workplace, and you 

4 said that your argument didn't apply to the person in 

her workplace. So you have to come up with something 

6 better than that. And I guess the question is your rule 

7 would seem to encompass, you know, a whole set of people 

8 who are leaving their houses for ordinary reasons: I'm 

9 going to work in the morning.

 And the question is whether the police can 

11 stop this person who's going to work in the morning, 

12 who's given no indication that he's seen the police 

13 officers at the scene, no indication that he's coming 

14 back immediately or, you know, in any amount of time 

that it will take you to complete the search. 

16  And that's not an outlier case. It seems to 

17 me that the hypothetical I just gave you might very well 

18 be the more common case than the hypothetical that you 

19 gave me. So, you know, why isn't this just too broad a 

categorical rule? 

21  MR. WALL: Well, Justice Kagan, let me break 

22 that up into both parts. First, you know, as far as 

23 detaining people who have other connections to the home, 

24 I think you're right that some of the arguments that the 

Court adopted in Summers and that the government is

1 making here could translate. And I think when those 

2 cases come to the Court, the Court will have to decide 

3 whether to recognize doctrines analogous to Summers or 

4 Terry in those contexts. But that's not what Summers is 

about. The connection that Summers discusses and 

6 approves is seeing someone leaving a home subject to a 

7 valid warrant for contraband. That's the only 

8 connection at issue here. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: But is it in the process? 

Does Summers apply and does this apply only when the 

11 police are in the process of executing a valid search 

12 warrant? 

13  MR. WALL: Yes, Justice Breyer. Even 

14 Petitioner, the way I read his briefs, concedes that if 

police had caught him outside the basement apartment or 

16 somewhere within the property bounds --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: If -- if the police 

18 executing the valid search warrant walked through the 

19 gate and at that moment the individual emerging from the 

house had not yet passed through the gate, then under 

21 Summers the police would have the right to detain him. 

22  All right. So the question here is he's 

23 walked through the gate. All right. Now, I guess the 

24 police -- all right, I see. The police objection is: I 

don't know. These things are complicated and we might

absolutely right. The government's central --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: I know you'd say that was 

7 right. 

8  MR. WALL: I mean, I -- the government's 

9 central contention is there's nothing magical about the 

gate for Fourth Amendment purposes. When he steps 

11 through the gate, he's just as much of a flight risk, a 

12 danger to officers and just as able to assist in the 

13 orderly completion of a search. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: There is something magical 

about the gate or at least about the immediate facility 

16 of the house. What we're trying to apply here is an 

17 absolute rule to make it unnecessary for the officers to 

18 guess whether they can do this or that. And the rule 

19 you propose is, well, you know, a mile away. What's 

your test, a reasonable --

21  MR. WALL: As soon as reasonably

 MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, it is an absolute 

6 rule and it tells you who, it gives you a who, who is 

7 detainable. People we find --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't give you a 

9 where. You need more than a who. You need a who and a 

where. 

11  MR. WALL: Well, the who is categorical. 

12 People you find on the premises or you see leaving the 

13 premises at a time when a magistrate has determined 

14 there's probable cause to believe a crime is being 

committed inside. The where, the location. Just like 

16 duration, just like use of force in the Muehler and 

17 Rotelli cases, those are subject to the general 

18 requirement of reasonableness under the Fourth 

19 Amendment.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Wall, the Summers 

21 case was an exception. The main rule is you have

23 was tied tightly to the house. You want him to stay on

he's going to disrupt the search, but it was -- it was

1 an exception to the main Fourth Amendment rule, and now 

2 you are asking to have that exception spread. 

3  And so today you say, oh, well, we're not --

4 we're not asking if the person gets to her workplace, 

but that the police, but maybe why -- why not? I mean, 

6 you -- it's one thing to confine Summers to the house, 

7 the immediate premises, and another to say seven-tenths 

8 of a mile away, that's okay, too. 

9  MR. WALL: Justice Ginsburg, I think the 

reason Summers carved out the rule is it said, look, 

11 for -- for current and recent occupants as a class, 

12 we -- officers see, they find or see them at a residence 

13 where there's probable cause to believe a crime is 

14 committed, so across the board we've got reasonable 

suspicion, and that's why we draw a rule so that we're 

16 not going to rebalance every time. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. But the 

18 across-the-board is a set of people who are at the house 

19 when you want to search the house. And of course, 

Summers makes perfect sense. You want to search the 

21 house, you can't have these people roaming around, 

22 right? So you have to detain the people. 

23  But what you're now saying is: Well, 

24 there's another class of people, they're going to work 

in the morning. And we've -- there's -- there is no

1 indication that they've seen the police officers; 

2 they're going to work. But we get to detain them, too, 

3 just because we have a warrant to search the house. And 

4 the question is why?

 MR. WALL: Justice Kagan, as far as we know, 

6 George Summers was going to work. I mean, George 

7 Summers was detainable, as was Petitioner here, on his 

8 view if we had caught him within the physical bounds of 

9 the property. The question is not, you know, how to 

apply it in that circumstance. It's does something 

11 meaningfully -- meaningful change when he hits the 

12 sidewalk or the neighbor's yard? 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, something meaningful 

14 very -- very much changes. Before, you're dealing with 

a problem of a person on the premises while you're 

16 trying to search the premises. And now you're talking 

17 about a person who is going to work, leaving the 

18 premises, letting you search the premises without any 

19 interference.

 MR. WALL: Justice Kagan, I don't think that 

21 explains why you couldn't let George Summers go on his 

22 way, and it doesn't explain why the Court in Summers 

23 didn't say, look, rather than roam the house, if it 

24 really is true that once we let you outside the front 

door or the front gate, you are no longer a danger and

1 are likely only to be a hindrance, why not give you the 

2 option to leave. Turn them out, because on Petitioner's 

3 view, they're safe to go. And what the Court in Summers 

4 recognized is, no, important interests are served by 

detaining people in that circumstance. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You have to draw a line 

7 someplace. When he is descending the steps to his 

8 house, he is still associated with the house. And once 

9 he steps over that line, the Summers rationale it seems 

to me doesn't apply. 

11  But there's a curiosity about this case, 

12 maybe you can explain it to me. They stop him 

13 seven-tenths of a mile away. By that time, the search 

14 is ongoing. They have found guns and contraband. They 

take -- why do they take him back to the house? What 

16 was the reason for taking? There was nothing there that 

17 he could -- he couldn't obstruct the search. He was in 

18 handcuffs. 

19  MR. WALL: I think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: He couldn't point out 

21 anything in drawers because they'd found it all. 

22  MR. WALL: I mean, I think at that point 

23 they had probable cause; they could have arrested him 

24 and I think they could have taken him down to the 

station house. They returned him to the scene instead.

1 And I don't think there's any evidence in the record 

2 about why they took him back to the scene rather than --

3 than straight to the station house. 

4  But, Justice Ginsburg, I do want to fight 

the premise a little bit. All -- all that the 

6 government is asking for is for the Court to look 

7 through the Federal and state cases, because we see the 

8 exact same interests that were served in Summers. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think -- I think we have 

11 to take the case on the assumption -- I agree with you 

12 there probably was probable cause -- but I think you 

13 have to take the case on the assumption that there was 

14 no probable cause to arrest, because they didn't -- they 

did not rely on that authority. 

16  MR. WALL: Justice Kennedy, in 

17 that -- assuming that's true, then they took him back to 

18 the scene to complete the search, by which time they had 

19 found the drugs and the guns, and then they did arrest 

him. And he has not claimed that at that point there 

21 wasn't probable cause for an arrest. But these risks 

22 are real, and they do play themselves out in the cases, 

23 Justice Kagan --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, the problem

2  Go back to the question you were asked by
 

3 one of my colleagues earlier, why wouldn't Terry give
 

4 you all of the rights that you're seeking on the
 

absolute rule, but subject your police conduct to the 

6 question of reasonableness, which is the normal standard 

7 of the Fourth Amendment? 

8  MR. WALL: Of course. A very brief Terry 

9 stop could allow a departing occupant to go on his way 

long before the search is completed, and now he's fully 

11 aware of the police presence. So now --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm -- I'm litigating 

13 for you. 

14  MR. WALL: Sure. Okay. Imagine that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I could very easily 

16 imagine that what the fight's going to be like below is, 

17 we stopped them because we saw them coming out of the 

18 house, and all we want to do is make sure that they 

19 don't return. So we're just going to hold them in 

place. We don't have to drag them in a car back to a 

21 place they just left. We're just going to stop them in 

22 place to get a phone call that everything's all clear. 

23  MR. WALL: Well, I take one of the 

24 differences between Terry and Summers to be that in 

Terry the seizure is tied to the officer's brief

1 investigation, and in Summers it's tied to the execution 

2 of the warrant. 

3  Now, if what you're talking about is a Terry 

4 stop that could last for the duration of the warrant, I 

don't know that there is much of a difference, then, 

6 between Terry and Summers. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, we don't know, but 

8 why don't we let that develop. 

9  MR. WALL: Well, because I think the danger 

is that courts will apply Terry the way that they have, 

11 and we don't want to dilute one doctrine with another. 

12  A brief Terry stop could allow occupants to 

13 go on their way, but now they're aware of the police 

14 presence. Now, they are much more of a risk to flee or 

harm officers. 

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Explain -- explain to 

17 me -- the police, they have the informant's tip, and 

18 they see them coming out of the house. So it seems to 

19 me it's a good case that that would be reasonable 

suspicion. Coming out of the house, he looks like what 

21 the informant says. 

22  Then they -- can they -- they pat him down 

23 and they find his keys, and the keys are to the house.

3 something. And, in the meantime, they stop a departing 

4 occupant, he's not carrying a gun, he answers the 

questions and does not arouse the officer's suspicion, 

6 and now he is on his way. And he is on his way while 

7 the search is ongoing, and now he knows about it. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: So what? What's he going 

9 to -- he's going to phone them and say, hey, you know, 

you're going to be searched. The cops are crawling all 

11 around the house already. 

12  So the only realistic additional threat is 

13 that he is going to voluntarily go back to where the 

14 police are in the house? I mean, you know --

MR. WALL: Well, that is --

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- this is so implausible. 

17 What -- what harm --

18  MR. WALL: Justice Scalia --

21  MR. WALL: I think the Texas officers in the

23 surprising, where they did let someone go from the 

24 scene, and she came back with an individual and started 

fighting with police.

6 foolhardy person would do it, but, unfortunately, that 

7 is a perfect description of many criminals who do not 

8 tend to be level-headed, rational actors. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't adopt absolute 

rules to cover foolhardy people. I mean, we -- absolute 

11 rules are designed to cover the mine run of cases, the 

12 generality of cases, not the oddball case. That's not 

13 what you use an absolute rule for. 

14  MR. WALL: That's absolutely right, Justice 

Scalia. And in the mine run of cases, what we know is 

16 that these people are leaving a home where there's 

17 probable cause to believe a crime is being committed. 

18 Police are detaining them a short distance away, and 

19 they are doing it in cases where people are fleeing or 

they -- we can reasonably believe they would flee once 

21 they've seen officers, if they were not detained. 

22  They are violent. They are aggressive.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an argument 

6 in Summers I just don't understand. The argument is you 

7 can detain the people because they might want to give 

8 the officers assistance. Well, if they want to give 

9 them assistance, they don't have to be detained.

 MR. WALL: Well --

 MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, I 

16 think it is one of three legitimate law enforcement 

17 interests where you have someone for whom there is 

18 articulable and individualized suspicion to believe that 

19 they are connected to criminal activity.

 And I think that this Court in Summers was 

21 absolutely right. You do find people securing guard 

22 dogs, moving families out of harm's way, providing keys 

23 so that officers don't have to break in and harm 

24 property or jeopardize third parties. You find them 

handing over contraband rather than endanger officers.

4  MR. WALL: Well, and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to give you the 

6 key to the cabinet. 

7  MR. WALL: -- and the argument in Summers is 

8 you can detain them because you've got reasonable 

9 suspicion. The question is, what are the interests 

served by the detention? And that is an interest served 

11 by detention. 

12  Now, we're not saying it's an independent 

13 basis to support it. These are people for whom, as a 

14 class, there's reasonable suspicion, which is why 

Summers carved out the rule that it did. 

16  Now, this -- the situation in this case and 

17 the Federal cases that we're seeing are not meaningfully 

18 distinguishable from Summers. You've got the same 

19 reasonable suspicion, same law enforcement interests, 

same minimal intrusion. There is no -- along no 

21 dimension is there a meaningful difference between this 

22 case and Summers.

3  He always goes right home. He takes the 

4 Number 3 bus, and he will be there in 20 minutes. Can 

you detain him at the office under your rule? 

6  MR. WALL: Justice Kennedy, no, not under 

7 Summers. 

8  Now, whether they can --

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, under the rule you're 

proposing. 

11  MR. WALL: I don't think so. I mean, when 

12 that case --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know -- I don't 

14 know why not, under the rule that's proposed.

 MR. WALL: -- when that case comes to the 

16 Court, the Court will have to decide whether to 

17 recognize a doctrine analogous to Summers and Terry. 

18 And I will honestly admit that some of the arguments 

19 that the government's making here and that the Court 

adopted in Summers will translate. 

21  But Summers is not about that. Summers is 

22 about current and recent occupants. And those, as a 

23 class, have reasonable suspicion.

1 the facts of a specific case. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, my -- I remain 

3 with my question, which is, we have a 

4 circumstance-driven power, Terry. Your power is really 

going much more broadly, because you're basically saying 

6 if that -- if probable cause exists to search a premise, 

7 it exists without being tied to an individual because 

8 anybody who leaves the house, whether or not they have 

9 been tied to a crime in that house in the past or not, 

is now subject to being detained. 

11  So we have evidence that only a husband is 

12 involved in a fraud, and his wife is leaving for work. 

13 Because she was observed leaving the house, she can now 

14 be stopped a mile away.

 MR. WALL: Justice Sotomayor, to be clear, 

16 that's not the government's rationale. That's the 

17 rationale of the Court in Summers. 

18  Maybe the wife is aiding and abetting. We 

19 don't have any idea. Maybe the wife, you know, is 

implicit in the -- the husband's crime in some way. The 

21 Court's point --

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So your -- your view is 

23 that Summers gave you -- entitled you to hold people 

24 merely for purposes of investigation --

MR. WALL: I --

Official 

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- without any 

2 reasonable suspicion? That's really what your rule is 

3 saying. 

4  MR. WALL: My view is with the Court's on 

Summers. It's appropriate to consider the nature of the 

6 articulable and individualized suspicion on which the 

7 police based the detention of the occupant of a home 

8 subject to a search warrant. 

9  And what the Court said is, whether you're 

inside or whether you're on the front steps or the 

11 sidewalk, like George Summers, that reasonable suspicion 

12 exists. The police have placed you in the home at a 

13 time when a neutral magistrate has determined there's 

14 probable cause.

 And to be clear, we're not trying to blow 

16 the doors off of this exception. This is a very narrow 

17 exception. What we see time and again in the Federal 

18 cases is the same fact pattern: Someone leaves the 

19 house; the police catch up to them within a mile, but 

usually just within a few blocks; and, they return them 

21 to the scene. 

22  The police are not treating this as a sort 

23 of entitlement. This is not Gant, where the results are 

24 outstripping the rationale.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The -- the procedure has to

1 be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, right? Now --

2 now, the requirements for a warrant are not the outer 

3 bounds of -- of what's reasonable, but nonetheless, what 

4 -- it seems to me that what's reasonable under the 

Fourth Amendment can be estimated from what the Fourth 

6 Amendment requires a warrant to contain, and what a 

7 warrant must contain is a description of the place to be 

8 searched, and the persons or things to be seized. 

9  And what you're arguing for is a special 

rule which says once you have a warrant that this place 

11 can be searched, you can seize anybody -- you can seize 

12 not only anybody there in order to protect the police, 

13 but anybody connected with the -- with the place. And 

14 that -- that is so contrary to what -- what seems to me 

the theory of -- of the Fourth Amendment that I am very 

16 reluctant to -- to extend our cases any further than 

17 they already exist. 

18  MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, we're not here 

19 asking for the Court to extend Summers. We are just 

asking for a faithful application of what the Court said 

21 in Summers. And I understand that, you know, it would 

22 seem troubling would -- were it not for the fact that

4  You're right, the Fourth Amendment does 

require reasonableness, and what the officers did here 

6 was eminently reasonable. They are executing a no-knock 

7 warrant at a drug stash house for a gun; they see 

8 someone leave who fits the description of the drug 

9 dealer; and rather than stop him right on the threshold 

inside the curtilage and risk alarming his confederates, 

11 they let him drive a short distance away and they return 

12 him to the scene. 

13  There's no meaningful difference between 

14 that and if they had stopped him right outside the 

house. The only thing they would have been --

the -- to the place where they keep the drugs, the 

21 basement or something.

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but the
 

8 question is whether you have to detain them to do
 

9 something you're saying they'd want to do.


 MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, we're not here 

11 saying that every time somebody could be helpful in a 

12 search you could go out and detain them. It is an 

13 exception to the normal probable cause requirement, but 

14 it's an exception analogous to Terry because you've got 

reasonable suspicion. And the question is there, okay, 

16 as a categorical rule, you know you've got reasonable 

17 suspicion for this entire group of people, current and 

18 recent occupants; what reasons do police have to detain 

19 them?

 And there are really good reasons. One, 

21 they tend to flee. And we see that in Cavazos out of 

22 the Fifth Circuit. Two, they provide assistance in the 

23 search; and three, they are often violent or aggressive 

24 individuals.

2 and drugs, and you see a number of amici states in here 

3 saying: Look, this is a legitimate and important law 

4 enforcement practice for officers in a very dangerous 

and volatile situation in executing these warrants. 

6  And I think Petitioner takes those risks way 

7 too lightly, and will not -- steadfastly refuses to 

8 engage the realities on the ground that we see in the 

9 cases. Judges and the Federal and state courts are 

grappling with this every day, and what these opinions 

11 reveal is that these risks cannot be so easily 

12 dismissed. They are serious and they are real, and we 

13 see them play themselves out across this entire set of 

14 cases.

 And what we don't see noticeably is the 

16 kinds of things that the Court tends to be worried about 

17 in Fourth Amendment cases: Abuse and police 

18 entitlement. Again and again, you see police detaining 

19 departing occupants a very short distance from a 

residence, returning them, not prolonging the detention, 

21 not engaging in exploitative questioning, and actually 

22 serving the three interests that the Court identified in 

23 Summers.

6  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. SHANMUGAM: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

9 Justice. Just -- just a couple of points.

 First of all, having suggested in its brief 

11 that the police may detain any individual with a 

12 connection to the place to be searched under Summers, 

13 the government today falls back to the view that the 

14 police may detain any individual with an observed 

connection, suggesting that this Court can leave for 

16 another day the question of whether to detain people 

17 with a certain but non-observed connection. 

18  Leaving that aside, the government suggests 

19 on at least five occasions today that that observed 

connection is sufficient to give rise to reasonable 

21 suspicion. That was not the basis on which this Court 

22 adopted its categorical rule in Summers. If it had 

23 been, the discussion of the special law enforcement 

24 interests supporting the rule would have been entirely 

superfluous.

1  And it's for that reason we would
 

2 respectfully submit that the Court made clear in
 

3 footnote 19 that Summers permits officers to detain
 

4 individuals regardless of the quantum of proof
 

justifying the detention of specific individuals. 

6  And this Court's subsequent cases applying 

7 Summers have made clear that Summers permits the 

8 detention of individuals with no apparent connection to 

9 the criminal activity being investigated.

 And that leads into my second point, which 

11 is that Terry will serve as a fallback in many of these 

12 cases to permit detentions of individuals who are seen 

13 leaving the premises, where there is a sufficient 

14 additional basis to give rise to reasonable suspicion. 

In fact, it may very well be the exception to the rule 

16 that you have a case in which there aren't sufficient 

17 additional articulable facts to give rise to reasonable 

18 suspicion. 

19  We would respectfully submit that this case 

falls within that exceptional category, but it really 

21 underscores why the expansion of Summers that the 

22 government is seeking is really unnecessary. 

23  I would just note, in response to a point 

24 that Justice Scalia made, that the fundamental flaw with 

the government's position is that it really can't be

1 reconciled with any original understanding of the Fourth 

2 Amendment. There's no historical evidence suggesting 

3 that officers at the time of the founding or thereafter, 

4 when executing search warrants, detained the occupants 

of the premises. 

6  And the problem with the government's 

7 approach is that it really would convert any search 

8 warrant into a search and seizure warrant. It would 

9 really would suggest that there is a freestanding right 

to detain anyone with a connection or an observed 

11 connection to the place to be searched that operates 

12 alongside the warrant-conferred right to conduct the 

13 search. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: What -- would you say the 

same thing about the exact situation in Summers? 

16  MR. SHANMUGAM: No, we wouldn't, 

17 Justice Alito. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: You think the original 

19 understanding was that what happened in Summers was 

okay, but if you get out of the immediate vicinity, 

21 that's where they drew the line? 

22  MR. SHANMUGAM: We're not challenging the 

23 rule of Summers itself. We're simply suggesting that 

24 there's no historical basis for that rule, and for that 

reason we think that any expansion of Summers would

1 really be of questionable validity. In Summers itself, 

2 the detention was truly incident to the execution of the 

3 warrant because, after all, the officers were 

4 approaching the house and literally just about to 

effectuate entry when the detention took place. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you can say there was 

7 a historical basis for the rule, in that officers have 

8 always been allowed to take necessary action to protect 

9 themselves. And that's the principal justification.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: Perhaps, but we have been 

11 unable to find any examples of detentions of occupants 

12 of the premises until at least 1880. And our point is 

13 simply that the detention ceases to be truly incident to 

14 the search where the individual has left the scene. The 

justifications for the detention evaporate at that 

16 point. 

17  Thank you. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

19  The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the 

21 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
