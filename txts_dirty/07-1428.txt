 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument today in Case 07-1428, Ricci v. DeStefano, and 

the consolidated case.

 Mr. Coleman.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. COLEMAN: Good morning, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 Racial classifications are inherently 

pernicious and, if not checked, lead as they did in New 

Haven to regrettable and socially destructive racial 

politics.

 Neither equal protection nor Title VII 

justified New Haven's race-based scuttling of the 

promotions Petitioners earned through the civil service 

process mandated by Connecticut law. The lower court 

required no strong evidentiary basis that the City was 

acting to remedy or avoid any actual discrimination, but 

strong safeguards are needed to smoke out illegitimate 

uses of race and to extinguish the racial favoritism 

that civil service laws -- excuse me -- are intended to 

prevent.

 Governmental employment actions grounded in

race must be strictly scrutinized because they engender 

divisiveness and cause race-grounded harm that the 

Constitution seeks to avert. That standard does not 

change with the race of those the government seeks to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask this 

question? Is it undisputed that it was a race-based 

decision?

 MR. COLEMAN: No, Justice Stevens. I think 

the city makes the argument that it was not a race-based 

decision simply because the effect of the scuttling 

resulted in no promotions being given at all. We 

believe that that is not a basis for distinguishing 

this. That it still remains a race-based decision.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Are you contending that 

that's an issue of fact that has to be tried out or that 

we should accept your version of that -- of that issue?

 MR. COLEMAN: I believe that that's an issue 

of law, Your Honor. It is no different ultimately than 

what the Court concluded in Croson. This type of an 

argument that a do-over is not a racial classification 

is exactly what happened in Croson. There was a do-over 

declared, a -- a rebidding; and yet the Court said, 

because that rebidding was declared for racial reasons, 

it would nevertheless be subjected to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was pursuant to --

to an affirmative action plan, and here we're dealing 

with this concept under Title VII of disparate impact. 

And let's take for one example a test that's given by a 

police department, a fire department, and it -- it's a 

physical fitness test, and it disproportionately 

excludes female applicants. And when the results come 

in and there are no women on the eligibility list, the 

department reconsiders. It thinks there is something 

wrong with this test. It can probably test for the 

necessary skills in a way that will not achieve those 

results.

 Would it be similarly impermissible, 

similarly based on an impermissible criterion, if the 

department said: We're not going to -- we have got the 

results of that test. We're going to throw it out and 

substitute another that will not have those skewed 

results.

 MR. COLEMAN: If that decision was grounded 

in a determination that we simply need to ensure that 

there are more women on the force, then, yes, it would 

be subjected to heightened scrutiny, maybe not strict 

scrutiny under that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not more women on the 

force, but this test that we're giving has the effect of 

excluding most women, just as the high school diploma

had the effect, a disproportionate effect, on one race.

 MR. COLEMAN: I think your question gets to 

part of the heart of this case, and that is, ultimately: 

Is the decision that's being made one that is -- is 

based in race or is -- is based on a determination that 

there is an improper test? But this decision is 

grounded in race if -- if the police department in your 

case had clear evidence that the test was simply 

unnecessary, that it was not job-related and could be 

clearly done by an identifiable alternative, I think at 

the end of the day there might be some basis. But if it 

is grounded in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So they would have to go 

-- I take it from what you said they would have to go as 

far as proving a Title VII disparate impact case against 

themselves. They couldn't do anything short of that to 

prevail when it is the majority race that is complaining 

about discrimination.

 MR. COLEMAN: To use the constitutional 

analogy, Your Honor, I think Wygant, Croson, Adarand, 

other cases, make clear that you do not have to prove 

the violation against yourself, but you do have to 

demonstrate that you have a strong basis in evidence for 

believing you are violating the law. In Wygant the 

plurality set that out citing convincing evidence.

JUSTICE SOUTER: The problem, Mr. Coleman, 

is that -- that the cases you are relying on, it seems 

to me, are cases in which ultimately what is being 

judged is a different result in the -- at the end point 

of the process which was starting. And the problem that 

I have with -- with using cases like that and -- and 

essentially the problem I -- I have with your argument 

is that it leaves a -- a municipality or a governmental 

body like New Haven in a -- in a damned if you do, 

damned if you don't situation. Because on -- on the 

very assumptions that you are making, if they go forward 

with -- with their -- their hiring plan, they certify 

the results and go forward with it, they are inevitably 

facing a disparate impact lawsuit.

 If they stop and say, wait a minute, we're 

starting down the road toward a disparate impact lawsuit 

and, indeed, there may be something wrong here, they are 

inevitably facing a disparate treatment suit. And 

whatever Congress wanted to attain, it couldn't have 

wanted to attain that kind of a situation.

 Why isn't the most reasonable reading of 

this set of facts a reading which is consistent with 

giving the city an opportunity, assuming good faith, to 

start again? And I -- I recognize there's got to be a 

good faith condition, and the -- the good faith can

always be attacked. But isn't that the only way to 

avoid the damned if you do, damned if you don't 

situation?

 MR. COLEMAN: No, I completely disagree with 

that, Justice Souter. It not simply a matter of good 

faith. The use of race in government is so -- the Court 

has been so --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you make no distinction 

between race as an animating discriminating object on 

the one hand and race consciousness on the other. There 

is no way to deal with a situation like this any more 

than there is a way to deal with -- with setting lines 

in voting districts --

MR. COLEMAN: I also --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- without pervasive race 

consciousness. That is not unconstitutional, and it 

seems to me that you are not observing that distinction 

in -- in your reply.

 MR. COLEMAN: I disagree with that as well, 

Justice Souter. There is a strong difference in what 

happened in this case. In partial answer to Justice 

Ginsburg's question, et al., this is not an issue where 

the -- where the city had before it and was making a 

determination that our examination is not job related. 

In fact, it is clear on the record that what the city

said is, this comes to the wrong racial result, and, 

therefore, there must be something wrong with the test. 

When pressed --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me ask you this 

-- this question, and I don't mean to interrupt your 

answer, but it is based on what Justice Souter and 

Justice Ginsburg have both been asking. Hypothetical 

case: The city says, our test is not very good. We 

need a new test.

 The expert says, don't pay us to have a new 

one. There are two great ones out there. One is in 

City A. The other is in City B. Use either one of 

those. They are great.

 They check. They find out that City A has a 

disparate impact in the statistical sense, not in the 

legal sense; that it disadvantages minorities, at least 

if you look at the passage rates. The other test 

doesn't. Are they permitted to take the test that 

doesn't have that differential?

 MR. COLEMAN: Under our alternative 

argument, Your Honor, assuming that -- that fixing 

disparate impact can be a compelling interest, we 

believe that you would at least have to demonstrate a 

strong basis in evidence to show that there is liability 

under (k)(2) -- your -- your example --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: My -- my question is --

and you can answer, I guess, both under Title VII and --

and under the Fourteenth Amendment. The city says, the 

only reason -- the only reason for our selecting the 

test from City B -- and both tests are very good tests 

-- is because minorities are better represented on the 

passing rate. Is that permissible?

 MR. COLEMAN: Under the Armstrong basis of 

evidence test, it might very well be because it meets 

the second qualification of the disparate impact 

statute, in which there is a specific alternative that 

is equally valid. If you are -- if you are going to 

assume that it can be shown to be equally valid and that 

it has less disparate impact --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And do you find -- and do 

you find any constitutional deficiency in the city's 

choice in that hypothetical case? Is there any 

Fourteenth Amendment problem?

 MR. COLEMAN: Well, we are certainly quite 

troubled that the Court would say, as it has not said, 

that the idea of -- of overcoming purely unintentional 

discrimination can be a compelling interest for cutting 

off what we believe is intentional discrimination. But 

barring that, our test, our backup test, is then that 

the strong basis in evidence test that exists from

Wygant and Croson would at least in its -- require that 

you have a strong basis in evidence for demonstrating 

liability under this --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what -- what if 

you've got -- what if you've got the basis of Justice 

Kennedy's hypothetical? You've -- you've got a 

municipality. It's a racially mixed municipality. It's 

got two tests. That's his hypothetical. One of them 

seems to suggest that there is going to be a significant 

racial disparity in the results if they use it. The 

other one from the other city or the other State 

suggests not. That's all they've got to go on.

 Is that a strong basis in evidence, or did 

they walk their way into a lawsuit by you if they adopt 

the -- the test that doesn't -- that at least in the 

other place hasn't produced the disparity?

 MR. COLEMAN: Under that argument, as long 

as it can be demonstrated to be equally content valid, 

equally or better content valid and to have a lesser 

impact, then it would show -- it would establish a 

stronger --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They would not have 

discriminated against any particular --

MR. COLEMAN: That's -- that's correct, Your 

Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- white or -- or majority 

applicants in -- in that selection, which is what 

occurred here. You had -- you had some applicants who 

were winners, and their -- their promotion was -- was 

set aside. That doesn't exist in these hypotheticals at 

all. It's just an abstract question of which of these 

two systems should be adopted.

 MR. COLEMAN: Well, I understood Justice 

Kennedy's hypothetical to be after you have taken a test 

and building upon the hypothetical.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It wasn't my --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. It was --

MR. COLEMAN: It was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It was designed to show, 

and maybe it's theoretical, but I want to know the 

answer so that I can understand this case. It's 

designed to ask you the question whether or not race 

consciousness is ever permissible.

 MR. COLEMAN: If -- if in your situation is 

simply in your situation the initial giving of the test, 

can you choose between those two tests, then we believe 

based upon what the Court has said in the past that a 

city could do that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: A city can in fact choose a 

test simply because there will be more minority people

who will in fact end up in the positions, that's your 

view?

 MR. COLEMAN: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: You needn't do anything 

else? I mean, that is your answer to Justice Kennedy?

 MR. COLEMAN: Nobody can know in fact --

JUSTICE BREYER: I want to know is that your 

answer to Justice Kennedy or not?

 MR. COLEMAN: Under that hypothetical, we 

believe they can choose that test.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you assuming --

JUSTICE BREYER: The answer is yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you --

JUSTICE BREYER: If that's so, what's the 

difference here? The most that you're saying is the 

worst that could have happened here; the worst that 

could have happened is that some experts told them, this 

test -- by the way, test one is -- is even worse than in 

Justice Kennedy's hypothetical. It's a test that 

probably discriminates negatively against minorities. 

So if you admit he could do it even if the test didn't 

discriminate negatively against minorities, namely 

test -- in his case, why can't you do it triply, in the 

case where there's evidence that they did discriminate, 

the test does discriminate against minorities?

MR. COLEMAN: Two very strong differences, 

Justice Breyer. First of all, our -- our firefighters 

had already taken the test; they had earned their 

promotions under state law. There was nothing left to 

do but to ministerially certify the lists, all right? 

The second difference is this. The only --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that can't be right 

if they -- if what you just answered to Justice Kennedy 

is -- is right.

 Suppose they had very strong evidence that 

the test that they had given that had these results, 

just as my physical fitness test that excluded all 

women -- that had it those results, it wasn't 

job-related, and there was a better test available, they 

wouldn't have any vested right in getting the promotions 

under those circumstances, would they?

 MR. COLEMAN: We're not claiming that it's a 

vested right. What we're claiming is that sometimes the 

Court has permitted governments to use race to remedy 

discrimination, and what would be needed in that 

hypothetical, Your Honor, is -- is the discrimination; 

and under your hypothetical there might very well be a 

strong case of discrimination, but under these facts 

there is no evidence in this record, and the city 

conceded below and never asserted in its bio in this

case that it had any basis to contest the 

job-relatedness of this examination or these 

examinations that were given. That is not part of the 

record in this case. The --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- one of the briefs 

said that, and maybe it wasn't done below, but one of 

the briefs said part of the claim is that some of the 

things that this test tested for were not -- were not 

qualities or abilities that were needed in New Haven, 

although they might be needed in other fire departments. 

The test had not been localized. Wasn't that part of 

the -- part of the objection?

 MR. COLEMAN: No, Your Honor, not in the 

district court. If you look at 1024a of the Pet. App., 

the city's lawyer in front of the district court and in 

its pleadings on summary judgment very clearly states 

that they didn't believe the job relatedness is even 

relevant to the case. All that they needed was good 

faith. They didn't need job relatedness, they didn't 

need an actual alternative, which is the basis of some 

of the hypotheticals you're giving. All they need is 

good faith.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why did they have 

the testimony before the Civil Service Board, about --

somebody from another testing company said this is a

multiple choice test; it tests rote memory; we could 

have come up with a test that would better test the 

skills needed to be -- nothing about the localization, 

but something about command presence. There was a term 

used, assessment centers; that this test didn't 

effectively test the skills that you needed on the job, 

and others did.

 MR. COLEMAN: Justice Ginsburg, that's not 

at all what Mr. Hornick said in front of the Civil 

Service Board. What he said is first, I didn't look at 

the test; two, I looked at the results and I see 

disparate impact; three, I'm not going to tell you what 

exams we gave, but I'm mentioning this thing called an 

assessment center, but I could design a better test, not 

having even looked at this test.

 But at the end of the day he also said, I 

think you should go ahead and give these promotions and 

in the future maybe you could fix your test. He didn't 

say here's an alternative; here's why this would be 

equally valid, here's why -- excuse me -- here's why 

this would have lesser impact. He simply said there is 

a concept called an assessment center, and I think that 

that might help you in the future, but you should go 

ahead and give the promotions on this test. Same --

ago you said you had two answers to Justice Breyer's 

question. I would like to hear the second one.

 MR. COLEMAN: Well, I actually think I got 

to the -- the first.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If you got to that, then I 

have -- I'd like one follow-up, and that's it.

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe if you don't 

mind, you could remind me what the second answer was.

 MR. COLEMAN: Again -- again, getting to the 

-- the fundamental point is, the use of race is so, so 

very important that the Court has always expressed 

skepticism and hostility to it, and what we're saying 

under this argument regarding a strong basis in 

evidence, and I think this answers both your 

hypothetical and Justice Souter's, is that what the city 

is saying, we don't have to demonstrate a strong basis 

in evidence for liability, we concede that we don't have 

that; all we have is good faith. And that's not enough. 

That leads --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you are -- as I 

understand it, you are imposing your strong basis in 

evidence test on what you referred to a second ago as 

the use of race, and that cannot be correct, because the 

use of race includes race-conscious decisions which are

not discriminatory decisions, and they certainly do not 

implicate the -- the obligation that you want to impose.

 You -- if -- if your argument is going to be 

coherent with what we start with, it can't be based 

merely on the use of race because if it does, then you 

are, in effect, turning any race-conscious decision into 

a discrimination decision, and that equation we 

certainly haven't made and we're never going to make.

 MR. COLEMAN: That's not our intention, 

Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then --

MR. COLEMAN: Our argument is clearly that 

this is not race-conscious, that it is race-based. The 

only determination that the city made is we don't like 

the results of this test; there must be something 

different that we can do; and we don't need to 

demonstrate --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But even --

MR. COLEMAN: -- viability or strong basis 

in evidence. We can simply fix it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't want to turn this 

into just a rhetoric exercise, but I think the rhetoric 

is important. You say the city took the position, we 

don't like the results of this test. That kind of a 

statement is consistent with saying, look, we don't like

the race of the people who are going to benefit from 

this. It's also consistent with the city's taking the 

position that there is such a racial disparity here that 

we are either asking for trouble or walking blindly or 

perhaps foolishly into a -- a racial disparity lawsuit 

based on disparate impact.

 Those are two very, very different 

attitudes. The first one is discriminatory. I don't 

see how the second one is discriminatory.

 MR. COLEMAN: But it -- it clearly is, 

Justice Souter. I think the distinction we're making in 

part is this principle of individual dignity that the 

Court has recognized is so strong distinguishes the 

hypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave me from -- form 

the example that we have in this case where they had 

already taken the test; identifiable individuals had 

earned their promotions; and then the city says too many 

non-minorities passed this test, and we are going to 

scuttle these results based on identifiable individuals 

who have passed and not based on any -- anything 

approaching a demonstration that there is actually any 

disparate impact liability.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the cost of drawing the 

distinction between this case and Justice Kennedy's 

hypothetical example is that if we draw that

distinction, the only way the city can get itself out of 

not only a certain lawsuit, but quite probably a 

successful lawsuit, is to make, in practical terms, a 

preliminary case against itself.

 MR. COLEMAN: I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And it -- I cannot conceive 

that Congress intended to put a city into that situation 

saying you've either got to blunder ahead into a losing 

lawsuit in court, or you have got to stop and expose 

yourself to another lawsuit which you can only win by 

proving that you at least had taken some steps in 

violating the law the first time. That is 

inconceivable.

 MR. COLEMAN: Justice Souter, I understand 

the concern about the employer's point of view, which we 

don't think stands here just because of the blatant way 

the City went about this. But in general terms we're 

not asking, contrary to Wygant, contrary to Croson, that 

you prove up a claim against yourself.

 But what we are saying is that the standard 

cannot be so light that the City very lightly and 

without any demonstration whatsoever that there might 

actually be liability here, based simply on the numbers, 

can say well, we're going to avoid liability and we're 

going to favor the minority group over the non-minority

group.

 All we're asking for is that the City 

undertake an honest and -- and open assessment of are we 

really likely to be liable here under the disparate 

impact provision of Title VII.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you do if there is 

not a liability in question? Suppose a school district 

deliberately, to obtain greater racial diversities in 

the schools draws district boundaries in a particular 

way among neighborhoods or plans a construction program. 

Then suppose having done that, indeed having once drawn 

the boundaries, a group comes to the school district and 

says you can achieve greater diversity if you redraw the 

boundary. You can achieve greater diversity if instead 

of building this school where the -- where the 

foundations are laid already, you build the school over 

here instead.

 Is that, in your view, different from your 

case?

 MR. COLEMAN: I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: It is? How?

 MR. COLEMAN: I think it is. I think you're 

giving examples from Justice Kennedy's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I hear his answer to 

this one first? I'm getting confused.

 MR. COLEMAN: I think the Court is certainly 

not fully in agreement on these questions, but the Court 

has at least an opinion suggested that those types of 

examples really are more of -- as Justice Souter, you 

were saying, the race-conscious type determination, and 

they don't violate this principle of individual dignity.

already earned promotions, and you're taking away 

benefits from them clearly on the --

which they think is a worse one, the difference between 

changing that boundary and changing the exam is what?

 MR. COLEMAN: The difference that the Court, 

I believe, has suggested is that that type of a 

redrawing is likely to include a number of traditional 

redistricting factors and that race in that instance, 

unless it was shown to ultimately predominate, would not 

make it a race -- or, excuse me, a race-based effort 

that would violate equal protection. I believe 

that's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you one 

question --

MR. COLEMAN: Of course.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- because I'm not sure I 

understood your answer to Justice Kennedy?

 What is your answer to Justice Kennedy's 

question about the two alternatives, one of which would 

fit exactly into the concluding clause of the first 

question presented to achieve racial proportionality in 

candidates selected? He says there are two alternatives 

before the school board, one would achieve the 

proportionality, the other would not. Are they free to 

choose the former?

has previously been given, if there are two tests, they

are equally valid, one can be demonstrated to have 

lesser disparate impact, if there are no other 

circumstances, then we think they could likely under 

that test --

JUSTICE STEVENS: They could take that test, 

even though its sole purpose was to achieve racial 

proportionality in candidates selected?

 MR. COLEMAN: I disagree that its sole 

purpose would be for that reason, Justice Stevens. As 

long as it meets the other criteria for job relatedness, 

it would still be fulfilling the City's necessary needs 

for -- for identifying quality candidates for making 

sure --

JUSTICE STEVENS: This is the -- putting to 

one side liability in the lawsuit, is the interest in 

avoiding disparate impact a valid State interest?

 MR. COLEMAN: We certainly have taken the 

position if disparate impact is identified purely as 

unintentional discrimination, then we don't believe it's 

a compelling State interest to overcome --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I didn't say compelling. 

I said is it a valid State interest. Just the interest 

in avoiding the kind of results you got here.

JUSTICE STEVENS: The City is not merely 

trying to avoid liability, they are trying to avoid a 

disparate impact. Is that a valid interest?

 MR. COLEMAN: If the disparate impact is 

caused by something that could be demonstrated to equate 

to discrimination on behalf of the entity, which is what 

the elements of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought the whole 

idea of disparate impact is it's unintentional, that's 

the assumption, disparate treatment, intentional 

discrimination, disparate impact, unintentional, but it 

has askewed racial results.

 MR. COLEMAN: There are two aspects to that, 

Justice Ginsburg. The first is that you may have 

disparate impact if it is caused by unintentional 

discrimination. But you may have disparate impact that 

occurs through no discrimination, intended or otherwise. 

And Watson clearly recognized that. And when Watson 

said we need to have strong evidentiary standards in 

evaluating disparate impact liability, it was 

recognizing that employers can't act simply to fix 

numerical disparities, because otherwise that leads to 

soft quotas.

 What we need is some demonstration that 

there is at least discrimination on behalf of the

entity, and perhaps that's unintentional, perhaps it's 

not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do we know whether 

something is discriminatory or just that it will have a 

certain effect? Because it's in spite of. For example, 

the Greek standard, the employer wants everybody to have 

a high school diploma, he wants an upgraded working 

staff, was told by this Court you can't do that because 

you would disproportionately exclude one race.

 MR. COLEMAN: Congress has spoken on this 

issue, has identified job relatedness and lack -- and 

the refusal of an alternative in K itself. We believe 

this is with the provisions we have cited, H, J and L, 

all in which Congress expressed a strong intent to favor 

tests.

 This Court has long recognized that Title 

VII prohibits not only intentional discrimination but 

acts that are discriminatory in their operation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With respect to both 

blacks and whites, correct?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, can you assure 

me that the government's position would be the same if 

this test -- black applicants -- firefighters scored 

highest on this test in disproportionate numbers, and 

the City said we don't like that result, we think there 

should be more whites on the fire department, and so 

we're going to throw the test out? The government of 

United States would adopt the same position?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and let me -- your 

question had two parts of it. You said there are too 

many blacks or too many whites. That is not a 

permissible objective under our view. The employer's 

action has to be tied to a concern about a violation of 

the disparate impact of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah.

department can engage in intentional discrimination to 

avoid concern that they will be sued under disparate 

impact. Why doesn't it work the other way around as 

well? Why don't they say, well, we've got to tolerate 

the disparate impact because otherwise, if we took steps 

to avoid it, we would be sued for intentional 

discrimination? This idea that there is this great 

dilemma -- I mean, it cuts both ways.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, to -- to say that an 

employer violates the disparate treatment provision of 

Title VII when it seeks to -- when it acts for the 

purpose of complying with the disparate impact 

provisions of Title VII would be to set those two 

mutually reinforcing provisions of Title VII at war with 

one another, contrary to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They are at war with one 

another.

 MR. KNEEDLER: No, I don't think so.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How can one avoid --

MR. KNEEDLER: One of the purposes of -- of 

the disparate impact test, as this Court has recognized, 

is -- is as a prophylactic against intentional 

discrimination, to root it out; also, as this Court said 

in Watson, to identify possible instances of subjective

some cases, to break down barriers that have existed in 

the past, for example, possibly the 60/40 weighting 

requirement that was under longstanding collective 

bargaining agreement.

 The disparate impact test has been 

recognized since Griggs as fundamental to fulfilling the 

purposes of Title VII.

 Title VII also has another important 

objective, as this Court has repeatedly recognized, 

which is that the voluntary compliance is the preferred 

objective -- excuse me -- preferred means of achieving 

the objectives of Title VII. Employers therefore 

require considerable flexibility in assessing their 

practices and deciding on appropriate action if it looks 

like one of their actions -- their practices would 

violate --

JUSTICE SCALIA: If it looks like or if the 

employer just in good faith believes?

 MR. KNEEDLER: We think -- we think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: When I say they're at war 

with one another, I mean they become at war with one 

another when you say that all that is necessary to 

permit intentional discrimination is the employer's good 

faith belief that if he didn't intentionally 

discriminate, he'd be caught in a situation of disparate

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, this --

JUSTICE SCALIA: At that point, they're at 

war with each other.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, in -- in our view, the 

-- in -- in the situation here where the -- where the 

test has been given, and there is a list produced, we 

believe that the -- in order to avoid summary judgment 

and a disparate treatment case on a claim of intentional 

discrimination, the employer would have to show that his 

concerns were reasonable ones. It has to be --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How does that --

MR. KNEEDLER: -- more than simply a 

disparate --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I know you said that in 

your brief when you made a distinction between mere good 

faith and reasonable belief. So how does one determine 

whether the concern that the employer is expressing is 

really in good faith or is reasonable? What are the 

indicia of reasonableness?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- for example, a -- a 

gross statistical disparity. A statistical disparity 

makes out a prima facie case under Title VII. We're not 

saying that in all cases simply a statistical disparity 

would be sufficient. A gross statistical disparity

could lead the -- the employer to believe that something 

was wrong with the test. So I think -- but in addition 

if the employer has concerns about the validity of the 

test -- as you pointed out, concerns were expressed to 

the Civil Service Board in this case.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Kneedler, could you 

explain how summary judgment in favor of the defendants 

on the Title VII disparate treatment claim can possibly 

be affirmed, even if the employer had reason to believe 

that the test that was given would expose itself to 

liability under a disparate impact theory? If that's 

not the employer's real reason for refusing to go ahead 

with the promotions, then isn't there liability under a 

disparate treatment -- under a disparate treatment 

theory, and that's a question for the jury? So how can 

we possibly affirm summary judgment here?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, we're -- we're not 

suggesting that the Court should affirm summary 

judgment. We're -- we're suggesting remand. The 

District Court identified reasons other than complying 

with Title VII's disparate impact standard for the 

employer's action here, diversity and role model, 

promotion of role models which we do not see as falling 

within this framework. But if the only evidence that 

the plaintiff has that the employer took race into

account was that the employer was aware, as obviously 

the disparate impact provisions require him to be, of 

the racially disparate impact of the test, and the 

employer acts in response to that, if that is the only 

evidence the -- the plaintiffs had, then the employer 

would be entitled to summary judgment. We think that

not urging affirmance of the summary judgment. You say 

there are or may be genuine issues of fact. So what are 

they?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think they go 

primarily to the district court's identification of 

diversity and -- and role models as possible motivations 

for what the -- what the employer was doing. The 

plaintiffs have also alleged that the -- that there was 

influence on the Civil Service Board external to the --

to the board's own decision. By the way, I should point 

out in this regard, at pages 166 and 167 of the Joint 

Appendix, the two board members who voted not to certify 

expressed concerns about the validity of the test based 

on what they had heard at the hearing.

 We don't think realistically a board in this 

situation should be required to do more, because it's 

important to recognize that the -- what the employer did 

here was not what concerned the Court in Wygant and 

cases like this. The Court -- the employer did not 

adopt racial classifications with all the potential for 

adverse consequences for individuals who are labeled by 

race and promote on the basis of race. That's not what 

the employer did here. The employer paused and decided 

that there might be another nondiscriminatory or less 

discriminatory means. In other words --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, counsel, you know, 

I've given law school examinations, looked at them, and 

bar examinations for years. There's never been one, 

when I don't look at it after the fact and say, you 

know, this could be better, this -- this was not quite 

right.

 So shouldn't there be some standard that 

there has to be a significant, a strong showing after 

the test has been taken that it's deficient? Before it 

can be set aside?

 MR. KNEEDLER: We -- we don't think so, and 

for several reasons. First of all, the action that the 

employer has taken in response, as I just said, is not a 

racial classification response. It is a facially 

neutral response where the -- where the employer has 

decided the test will -- perhaps we'll look for another 

standard which would be given and applied equally to all 

applicants.

we've been talking just about the prima facie case, but 

those are important elements as to whether the test is

predominates.

months, and I hope I'll get a few more minority or 

female applicants.

 Now, what's his reason? He wants more 

diversity in the workforce. Now, in your opinion, does 

the Constitution permit that extension?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I -- I think that's a more 

difficult question, but there may -- there may be a 

situation where the employer is concerned that his 

recruitment or his job announcement has had a disparate 

impact in terms of the -- of the applications that he 

has gotten. In -- in that situation, the employees who 

have responded and may be advantaged, like the people 

promoted here may actually be taking advantage of a test 

that imposes barriers and disadvantages other people.

 So when -- when we consider the impact in a 

situation like this on somebody who has passed the 

promotion test, it's important to consider that the 

people who have passed it may have benefited from a test

that is discriminatory.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, this may be 

the same question Justice Breyer asked, but I'd like 

something closer to a yes or no answer. Does the 

government consider promotion of diversity by itself a 

compelling state interest in the employment context as 

opposed to the school context?

 MR. KNEEDLER: We think -- we think it 

probably is a compelling state interest, but it is not 

one that -- that can be advanced by race -- by racial 

classifications. And that -- and that is our basic 

submission here. This was not a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can it be --

MR. KNEEDLER: This was not a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can it be advanced 

by taking actions to avoid what is perceived as a 

disparate impact?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, the 

disparate impact is regarded as something you can 

intentionally respond to by drawing racial distinctions 

solely because you would like a more diverse workforce?

 MR. KNEEDLER: No, not drawing racial 

distinctions. That's our -- this -- the employer's 

response here did not draw racial distinctions. It did

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It didn't care -- it 

had to draw racial distinctions because it looked at the 

test and said, we think there's a problem because of the 

racial makeup of who's going to get the promotions.

to the discriminatory test or what -- what it was 

reasonably concerned was a discriminatory test --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it looked at the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Counsel, it looked at the 

results, and it classified the successful and 

unsuccessful applicants by race.

us to say this isn't race? I have -- I have trouble 

with this argument.

 MR. KNEEDLER: No, with respect, it did not 

classify according to race; it looked in general terms. 

It did not have the names of individual people. It 

looked in general terms at what the racial disparity of 

the test was. It just --

names; it just looked at the label of what their race 

was. That's all they were concerned about.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Title VII's disparate impact 

test requires -- requires an employer to be aware of and 

respond --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's inconsistent 

with your answer to the Chief Justice who was exploring 

whether or not what we have here is a -- is a racial 

criteria, pure and simple, and you say, well, it's 

general. And then we point out that each applicant 

didn't have his name, but they had his or her race.

 MR. KNEEDLER: But the employer -- the 

employer was not making a decision to go forward and 

appoint individuals or promote individuals because of 

their race. The employer stopped there and said we're 

going to start over. That new test would be given 

equally to all employees, not any one particular 

employee.

you this? You -- you've recommended that we set aside 

the summary judgment and send the case back for a

MR. KNEEDLER: As I've mentioned to Justice 

Ginsburg, I think it would go -- there are several 

things. One, it would go to the justifications that 

were advanced by, that identified by the district court 

here that do not fit into this framework, do not fit 

into complying with the Title VII disparate impact test, 

and those are promotion of diversity and -- and role 

models.

 That is -- that is one. Also the district 

court did not apply what we believe is the right test, 

whether the employer had a reasonable basis for 

believing that what it was doing was necessary or a 

reasonable basis to believe it might be violating the 

disparate impact test. If it did not have a reasonable 

basis then we believe there would be a triable issue for 

the jury.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When -- when I asked that 

you question, you said that one issue of fact was 

whether the board was acting in response to improper 

influence, to racial politics.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. That -- the district 

court rejected that argument and whether or not that 

should be revisited on remand is -- is another matter.

issue of fact? How can you possibly get around that?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, one side says what 

you say is just pretext; the real reason was just 

politics. Isn't that an issue of fact that has to be 

tried?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, under this -- under 

this Court's decisions dealing -- dealing with summary 

judgment, even on questions of intent, the -- the 

plaintiff ordinarily has to come up with some 

affirmative evidence that there was -- that there was in 

this case an impermissible racial motive to do that. 

And the -- the district court looked at what the civil 

service commissioners said and concluded that -- that 

they did not have an impermissible racial motive, that 

they were responding to concerns about the validity of 

-- of the test.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But does the government 

think that you can just -- in a case like this you can 

just look at what -- what is said by the ultimate 

decision-maker and ignore the input from other people 

who may have influenced the process?

 MR. KNEEDLER: No, no, we do not. There may 

be other people who had input into the process, and 

whether the -- the district court evaluated that and

concluded that the -- that the input, that there was not 

a triable issue for summary judgment -- to avoid summary 

judgment on that question. That would be open to the 

district court to reconsider on remand. We don't deny 

that -- that it could go beyond that, but our principal 

concern here is the analytical framework that an 

employer who seeks to comply with the disparate impact 

requirements of Title VII which have been longstanding 

should not be teamed to have engaged in the sort of 

intentional discrimination that either the Equal 

Protection Clause or Title VII prohibits.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. MEADE: Mr. Chief Justice, and maybe it 

please the Court:

 Employers, both private and public, are 

required to comply with Title VII's disparate impact 

provisions, which seek to root out barriers to equal 

opportunity. When an employer learns that a practice 

has a severe adverse impact such that it creates an 

inference of discrimination, and evidence further 

supports that inference, the employer should be granted 

some limited degree of flexibility to act. An employer

certainly should not be encouraged or forced to make a 

promotion on the basis of the questionable practice.

 Title VII's disparate impact provisions are 

designed to remove structural barriers to 

discrimination, and when an employment practice has an 

adverse impact such that it substantiates an inference 

of discrimination, an employer should look beyond that 

adverse impact.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If all the employer --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask you --

JUSTICE ALITO: If all the employer has is 

evidence that the test results violate the four-fifths 

rule, is that sufficient?

 MR. MEADE: In our view it is not 

sufficient, and that is not what was at issue here. 

First of all, there was a severe adverse impact, much 

lower than the four-fifths rule, much lower than what 

this Court found in Connecticut v Teal, and in addition, 

not just on the pass/fail ratio --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if I could modify the 

question. Is there some statistical point at which 

that's sufficient, if it's not four-fifths, if it's 

nine-tenths --

MR. MEADE: Our view --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- that alone would be

sufficient?

 MR. MEADE: Our view is that it might be 

conceivable under Title VII in some cases for the 

statistical disparity to be so severe such that it would 

give an employer a reasonable basis under Title VII. 

However, that's not what we argue here.

 We argue here that an employer should be 

able to act when it has a severe adverse impact which 

creates an inference of discrimination, coupled with 

evidence that creates doubts about the flaws in the test 

or the possibility of alternatives.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I ask you to 

touch on the distinction between racial discrimination 

and race-conscious action? The actions that were taken 

in many of our cases, in Croson and Adarand, Parents 

Involved, Wygant, were obviously race-conscious actions; 

there was a reason that the governments in those cases 

were taking the action. It was because of what they saw 

as the impact on race. Yet we concluded that was racial 

discrimination. So what's the -- how do you draw the 

line between race-conscious that's permitted and racial 

discrimination that's not?

 MR. MEADE: Well, two answers, Mr. Chief 

Justice. First of all, this race consciousness is race 

consciousness that's mandated by Federal law. This is

not a discretionary decision by an employer.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if we --

if we agree with your -- I mean, you're assuming, it 

seems to me in your argument, that the actions that 

they've taken here are not intentional racial 

discrimination; and of course if they're not, then you 

don't have much to worry about. But let's assume that 

they are, as we found they were in Croson and Wygant and 

Adarand and Parents Involved.

 MR. MEADE: Well, the difference in those 

cases that you talk about, Croson, Adarand, Parents 

Involved, they involve express racial quotas -- excuse 

me, express racial classifications, where the government 

is making a decision based on a particular individual on 

the basis of race.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the only reason 

you say that isn't by an individual is that you have 

blacked out the names?

 MR. MEADE: No, because it's a facially 

neutral action which applies to all test takers the 

same. That doesn't mean --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position is 

what? They threw out the test, so you would have no 

problem at all if they looked at those results and they 

were predominantly black rather than white; you would

say the city can throw out the test and there's no 

racial discrimination there at all?

 MR. MEADE: No, I would say that there's no 

classification. However, there's another way to trigger 

strict scrutiny and that comes under cases like 

Arlington Heights and Feeney, and the action that the --

the facially neutral action that the city took here 

falls under that line of cases. And then --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't see how you can 

call it facially neutral. It's neutral because you 

throw it out for the losers as well as for the winners? 

That's neutrality?

 MR. MEADE: There is no classification, 

because each individual, and -- when a particular 

individual is looked at and a decision is made on the 

basis of race, that is a racial classification. If --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this case would 

come out differently, if the list was there with then 

names and they go down and instead of saying throw out 

the test, they said Jones, you don't get the promotion 

because you're white; Johnson, you don't get it because 

you're white. And they go down the list and throw out 

everybody who took the test; then that would be all 

right?

tests are being thrown out and different decisions are 

not being made on the basis of different individuals on 

the basis of race, then --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So they can keep --

they get do-overs until it comes out right? Or throw 

out this test; they do another test; oh, it's just as 

bad, throw that one out; get another one that's a little 

better, but not so -- throw that one out?

 MR. MEADE: Well, two responses. The first 

response is a legal one, the second one is a practical 

one. As to the legal answer, if a city were to do that 

or an employer were to do that again and again, first of 

all, that would go to intent, whether the intent of the 

employer were actually to comply with Title VII or for 

some other intent.

 Second of all, it would speak to whether 

there are actually equally valid less discriminatory 

alternatives. Second, the practical --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well if -- how many 

times before it's a problem?

 MR. MEADE: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say if they did 

it over and over again. What if they did it twice here?

 MR. MEADE: Well, that would be a question 

about whether they had a reasonable basis to do it. And

I would say if they did it a second time, that could 

create an inference of discrimination.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what has New 

Haven done in fact? This certification was requested in 

March of 2004; we're now 2009. What has New Haven done 

in order to get lieutenants and captains in the fire 

department?

 MR. MEADE: Justice Ginsburg, this is 

information outside the record, of course. The -- the 

city has held tests for other positions, both written 

and oral, in assessment centers that have not had a 

severe disparate impact -- actually, that have not had 

an adverse impact at all under the four-fifths rule.

 And specifically for the lieutenants and 

captains, what the city has been forced to do is have 

temporary acting promotions on a rotating basis based on 

seniority. But the city has not gone forward with any 

promotions yet, and, in fact, the Petitioners in this 

case may in the end receive some or all of the 

promotions. But the city has a duty to make sure that 

its process is fair for all applicants, both black and 

white.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I have purposely gone, of 

course, to the concurring opinion because I believe it's 

the controlling opinion in Parents Involved, and there

are two examples in that opinion. One is strategic site 

selection of new schools, i.e., a planned building, and 

the second is drawing attendance zones with a general 

recognition of the demographics. Those are given as 

examples of instances where there is race consciousness, 

but it does not trigger strict scrutiny.

 Now, why is your case like that rather than 

being like those examples where an employer or a 

government official picks particular people or uses 

quotas in order to get a certain quota or pay attention 

to race in an individual selection, both based on race, 

which clearly does require strict scrutiny? And if 

there is a difference, even then why is yours justified?

 MR. MEADE: Justice Breyer, there are two 

ways to enter strict scrutiny. One is a racial 

classification which makes different decisions based on 

different individuals on the basis of race. Cases like 

Croson or Wygant or even affirmative action plans are 

examples of making different distinctions based on 

different individuals on the basis of race.

 There is another line of cases about --

where there's a discriminatory purpose plus adverse 

impact on a certain group under the Arlington Heights 

line of cases.

 Here the Petitioners argue that there is an

adverse impact on them. Of course, that depends on the 

assumption that there was, in fact, a valid test. But 

here, then, under that line of cases the question is: 

What is the discriminatory purpose? And this Court's 

cases are not clear about what a discriminatory purpose 

is under the Arlington Heights line of cases. However, 

the answer to your question is: Compliance with a 

Federal statute, even a race conscious Federal statute, 

cannot be deemed a discriminatory purpose under the 

Arlington -- Arlington Heights inquiry. It is very 

different.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that -- I am 

sorry. Is that correct if we -- we conclude strict 

scrutiny does apply under the Constitution? Compliance 

with a statute, looking at impact, is a compelling 

interest trumping strict scrutiny under the Equal 

Protection Clause?

 MR. MEADE: No, Your Honor. If strict 

scrutiny applies, then the question is: Is there a 

compelling interest? And complying -- complying with a 

Federal statute needs to be a compelling interest under 

the Equal Protection Clause. The reason is, otherwise, 

State and local governments would be in an impossible 

position of trying to determine whether they should --

to how you construe the statute. It seems to me an odd 

argument to say that you can violate the Constitution 

because you have to comply with the statute.

 MR. MEADE: Well -- well, I would disagree. 

That would only be true if there were some doubt as to 

the constitutionality of the disparate impact 

provisions. But here that -- this Court first 

articulated "disparate impact." Congress has reaffirmed 

that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, but you are 

loading the -- the equation. The Chief Justice's 

question I don't think has been -- been fully answered. 

You are -- you are saying that you can eliminate 

constitutional concerns because the statute is enacted, 

which just repeats those same constitutional concerns. 

It's -- it's like having two tracks on the audio that 

don't quite fit.

 MR. MEADE: Well, I -- I may have 

misunderstood the question, but compliance with Federal 

statutes have to be a compelling interest as long as 

that -- that statute is constitutional. Now --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course you're not saying 

that -- that the test is -- is compliance. You're --

you're saying the belief that it's necessary for 

compliance is a compelling State interest.

MR. MEADE: Or --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean everybody would 

probably concede that if -- if continuing would clearly 

be in violation, of course, it's a compelling interest. 

But the issue here is: Is it enough if the employer 

simply worries that if he doesn't make the change, he 

may be in violation?

 MR. MEADE: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what's the line 

there?

 MR. MEADE: Well, the line is set out by 

this Court's cases. So assuming strict scrutiny applies 

and assuming that compliance with Title VII is a 

compelling interest, then the question is whether an 

employer has a sufficient basis. And this Court's 

cases, both in the intentional and unintentional 

context, say that that's a strong basis in evidence, and 

so that would be the relevant test. This Court has 

applied --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You acknowledge strong 

basis in evidence is -- is what -- what the city has to 

have?

 MR. MEADE: Assuming that strict scrutiny 

applies --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

MR. MEADE: -- then, yes, then the city 

needs to have a strong basis.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I get back just 

-- just -- since I don't understand it yet, the 

distinction between intentional racial discrimination 

and race conscious action. I thought both the plurality 

and the concurrence in Parents Involved accepted the 

fact that race conscious action such as school siting or 

drawing district lines is -- is okay, but discriminating 

in particular assignments is not.

 Now, why is this not intentional 

discrimination? I understood you to say it was because 

you don't have particular individuals being treated on 

the basis of their race. You are going to have to 

explain that to me again, because there are particular 

individuals here. They are the plaintiffs, and they say 

they didn't get their jobs because of intentional racial 

action by the -- the city. Why is that not on the 

racial -- intentionally racial discrimination side 

rather than the permissible race consciousness side?

 MR. MEADE: Well, again, this is a question 

about what triggers strict scrutiny, and compliance with 

the Title -- compliance with the Federal statute should 

not be deemed a -- a discriminatory purpose. However, 

if strict scrutiny applies, then this Court's

traditional strict scrutiny analysis is a way to test 

the decision.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that -- you 

may be right that that's what the question is about. I 

still don't have in my mind from you a line about how we 

decide. Because there are many cases, Croson, Adarand, 

Wygant, Parents Involved, where we said action taken 

obviously because of race is nonetheless discrimination. 

So -- and then there are cases where we have recognized 

that race conscious action is permissible. Again, what 

-- when I look at something like this, how I do decide 

which side of the line that's on -- this is on?

 MR. MEADE: Well, again, all of those other 

cases involved discretionary actions by State actors, 

and those are -- were making decisions, trying to 

comply, trying to further various goals, and in those 

cases making a very express use of race that a 

particular individual -- when that person was looked at, 

whether in Croson, whether in Wygant, whether in Parents 

Involved, a particular decision was made as to that 

individual.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But just to take 

Parents Involved, it wasn't a necessary -- the driving 

factor was not a specific decision with respect to 

specific individuals. They didn't care whether it was

Jones or Smith that they were citing. All they cared 

about was the race. And it seems the -- the same here. 

You maybe don't care whether it's Jones or Smith who is 

not getting the promotion. All you care about is who is 

getting the promotion. All you care about is his race.

 MR. MEADE: Well, the -- the difference 

there is that in that case, Jones and Smith, different 

decisions were being made on the basis of race such that 

there was a labeling on the basis of race. And here 

there is no such labeling because here there is a 

question about whether this process is in fact picking 

the most qualified individuals for the job. And that's 

what Title VII is designed to do.

 It is, yes, certainly a race conscious 

decision, a race conscious statute. But what Title VII 

is trying to do is to make sure that we don't perpetuate 

discrimination, albeit unintentional, and, therefore, to 

take away barriers that have existed over time and that 

continue to exist.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say "take away 

barriers," one thing is not a hundred percent clear. 

Your position is we have to do this in order to avoid 

Title VII disparate impact liability. Are you not 

reciting as a justification either the diversity in 

police -- policing firefighting or still overcoming a

legacy of the past where fire departments were among the 

most notorious excluders on the basis of race? You are 

not -- you are not saying rectification of past 

discrimination? You are not saying diversity?

 MR. MEADE: We're not saying that. We did 

not say that below. And, in fact, the board members who 

voted against certification cited flaws with the test 

and flaws with the process, and that was the basis for 

their failure to certify.

 And the problem with a discriminatory test 

is that it does not set a level playing field. It may 

create an illusion of meritocracy, but the problem is it 

not only disfavors certain individuals, but on the flip 

side, it also necessarily advantages others --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You just referred --

MR. MEADE: -- and therefore --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. You just 

referred to a discriminatory test. What you said in the 

district court, and I quote, the issue is not whether 

the tests were valid.

 Are you just changing positions on that?

 MR. MEADE: No, not at all. The ultimate 

validity of the test, our position below, was not 

relevant; the question is what was before the board. 

And the board heard 5 days of testimony over 2 months.

And as I mentioned, the two individuals who voted 

against certification cited concerns with the test and 

concerns with the process, and that was the basis for 

their decision.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you mean by --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'd like to talk just 

briefly --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I would like to talk just 

briefly about this point that the -- some of our 

hypotheticals where the test hadn't been given yet. 

Here the test has been given. And I had some concerns 

along the line of Justice Ginsburg's question. She 

said, well, it's not a vested interest.

 On the other hand, 2000e-(l)(2) says that 

test results can't be altered. There's a statutory 

interpretation question of whether that means they can't 

be used altogether. Two points about the statute.

 Number one, doesn't that diminish at least 

the force of the argument that this is a vested 

interest? It means the tests are -- have a -- have a 

certain presumption in -- in their favor.

 Secondly, on -- and maybe this is a question 

for the -- for the Petitioners rather than you. If we 

-- let's assume that we relied on that statute and said

that there's a Title VII violation here because the 

statute was violated. I know you have an 

interpretational argument there. Would that give the 

Petitioners all the relief they need here, or is there 

still additional relief under their 1983 cause of 

action?

 MR. MEADE: To answer your first question, 

the question of statutory interpretation, I would 

disagree with the suggestion that that gives support to 

the Petitioners' side, and for the following reason: 

Congress made a careful judgment about what can and 

can't be done once tests have been administered, and it 

told employers it -- it can't alter the scores when 

those scores are being used. And in -- what that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It can't alter the 

results. But let's not get into the statutory 

interpretation --

MR. MEADE: But the -- but the point is that 

that ties the hands of employers so that the employer, 

in fact, is limited in what it can do. Just because a 

test has been administered doesn't mean that Title VII's 

disparate impact provisions suddenly disappear. And as 

a number of lower courts have stated, there's no 

entitlement to be promoted on the basis of a flawed or 

discriminatory test.

The problem is, the alternative is to force 

employers to go forward and to use a discriminatory or a 

potentially discriminatory test. That has two problems.

 First, it's inconsistent with the goal of 

merit-based selection; and second of all, if it turns 

out that there is, in fact, discrimination, a court then 

needs to undo that discrimination. A court will often 

need to use racial quotas or set-asides to try to undo 

or to remedy the discrimination that has happened.

 So it's much better for an employer to stop, 

to not go forward with discrimination, even after the 

test has been used, rather than to rush forward and to 

create potentially further discrimination and a more 

aggressive use of race down the road.

 Another problem with creating a high 

standard is it will discourage employers from removing 

barriers to equal opportunity. For example, with 

respect to an ongoing practice, if an employer learns 

that that practice has a disparate impact, but is not 

sure one way or another, and gets rid of that provision, 

under Petitioners' theory that employer will necessarily 

be liable to either blacks or whites. The only way that 

it can defend against a lawsuit by whites would be to 

argue that it was, in fact, violating the disparate 

impact rights of black Americans.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What type of -- what 

type of other things are you talking about there?

 MR. MEADE: I mean, it could -- could be, 

for example, if there were a five-part training program 

that the City or an employer set up, and individuals may 

have completed some portion of the training program such 

that there would be similar reliance interests like 

the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the question, 

I guess, would be whether the program was valid or not 

under the traditional approaches you take under Title 

VII.

 MR. MEADE: Exactly. But then the question 

is whether you're forced --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So does your 

position here depend on a conclusion that this test is 

invalid?

 MR. MEADE: No, it doesn't. The question is 

whether the employer had a sufficient basis at the time 

of its action to make a determination that the test 

should not be used.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And why didn't it have a 

sufficient basis here? It -- it chose the company that 

framed the test, and then as soon as it saw the results, 

it decided it wasn't going to go forward with the

promotions. The company offered to validate the test. 

The City refused to pay for that, even though that was 

part of its contract with the company. And all it has 

is this testimony by a competitor, Mr. Hornick, who 

said -- who hadn't seen the test, and he said, I could 

do a better test -- you should make the promotions based 

on this, but I could give you -- I could draw up a 

better test, and by the way, here's my business card if 

you want to hire me in the future.

 How's that a strong basis in the evidence?

 MR. MEADE: Well, first of all, the City did 

not act on the basis of numbers alone. It had 5 days of 

hearings where it heard from stakeholders on all sides. 

And it heard numerous flaws in the test at those 

hearings.

 For example, there were arbitrary weightings 

of the scores which had no scientific basis; the company 

skipped critical design steps in the process; and 

although this was not before the board, it later turned 

out that there was no calibration in either the cut-off 

score or how the test was ultimately going to be used. 

Previous tests had a much less severe adverse impact. 

This test was an outlier.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What difference does the 

cut-off score make?

MR. MEADE: The difference of a cut-off 

score is a determination, a scientifically based 

determination to determine who is qualified and who is 

not qualified for --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I understand that, but 

the people at the top would -- the problem here was not 

the composition of the people who scored above the 

cut-off, was it? It was the composition of the -- of 

the people who would be eligible for promotion under the 

"rule of three"?

 MR. MEADE: Well, two responses, Justice 

Alito. First of all, as to the pass-fail rate, that 

could create a separate disparate impact violation under 

Federal law. So that was relevant for separate 

purposes.

 But in addition, it's also true that the 

test was not calibrated for use for rank ordering, to 

ensure that a 93 was better than a 91. And this was a 

special problem because of an intervening decision by a 

court that was -- that was rendered after the tests were 

designed, after the tests were taken, after the tests 

were scored.

 There was -- there's no evidence that the 

tests were precise enough to be able to determine who --

who should rank higher versus lower based on those

scores. And the amicus brief of the human resources --

human resources professionals points out this point.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your response to 

me that you don't have to show that the test is invalid, 

your argument is you just have to show that there's a 

basis for being worried that it might be invalid. And 

then it seems to me the only distinction is how high a 

showing you require. And you reject the idea that you 

have to show a strong basis in the evidence?

 MR. MEADE: Yes and no --

that. I just thought you just -- I was -- almost wrote 

it down.

I guess I should say I understand from your brief if not 

from your argument that --

MR. MEADE: No, no.

strong basis in fact standard?

 MR. MEADE: To answer in a way that's 

consistent to -- to both of you, the answer is if the 

test is under Title VII, strong basis should not be the

standard. This Court has never indicated that it should 

be. And that would be much too high of a standard to 

place on private employers.

 However, if this Court concludes that strict 

scrutiny applies, which we think it should not, but if 

this Court concludes that strict scrutiny does apply, 

then, yes, we agree --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I guess, my -- so 

my -- your position is that you should never have a 

strong basis in fact standard, because you don't think 

strict scrutiny should apply, and you think if it's 

under Title VII, it's only reasonableness?

 MR. MEADE: That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position is 

that the city -- the -- the government can take action 

without -- only if it's reasonable. It's a reasonable 

view of whether or not they might or might not be 

liable. That's the standard. And then they can engage 

in race-based action?

 MR. MEADE: We agree with the government's 

articulation of the standard of reasonable basis. 

Again, I would --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But does it have to be 

reasonable basis to believe they would be liable if they 

went ahead? Or can reasonableness refer to something

other than the probability of or the -- the likelihood 

of liability?

 MR. MEADE: I agree that it could be 

something less than that. And if --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what is 

something less than that, that they might be sued?

 MR. MEADE: No, not that they might -- might 

be sued. Again, this is, just in the Title VII context, 

so this will affect all private employers, some of which 

will be small employers where a single human resource 

professional will be trying to make the determination. 

There won't be hearings as there were in this case. And 

the question is sometimes a severe prima facie case 

could be sufficient under Title VII, not under the 

strong basis standard, but potentially under Title VII. 

And if a human resource professional or if an employer 

had a belief that further investigation could yield 

evidence of a Title VII violation, that would be 

sufficient under the reasonable basis standard.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Isn't that -- isn't 

that kind of a blank check to discriminate, if all they 

need is a reasonable basis to think that further 

investigation might be useful?

 MR. MEADE: No, it's not because this is a

way to reconcile, under Title VII, the two provisions of 

this statute. However, in this case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm sorry --

that's an answer about why it would be okay. I'm just 

saying, isn't it in fact a blank check?

 MR. MEADE: Well, I would disagree. No, it 

is not a blank check.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But --

MR. MEADE: Here, however, we had much more. 

There was a strong basis in evidence here. This Court, 

under the strong basis standard, has suggested that a 

strong basis is met when the threshold conditions for 

liability are met. That's what this Court said in Bush 

v. Vera, a plurality in Bush v. Vera, as well as Abrams 

v. Johnson.

 The question is how to apply that standard 

to this case. That standard would suggest that a prima 

facie case, which, again, is not just adverse impact 

alone, but it's adverse impact that creates an inference 

of discrimination could be enough. Here we have not 

just that, not just --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Meade, let me -- let 

me go back to one earlier question. Suppose everybody 

agrees that you're right on the -- on the record here 

now, and the City goes ahead and does another test, with

selection of candidates, and they come out exactly the

further?

hypothesized, as part of the example.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. COLEMAN: There's another statute that 

the Court ought to consider in the Title VII context, 

and that's section 2000e-7, which says that Title VII 

will not overrule and pre-empt State law unless there is 

a violation of Title VII.

 In asserting that, under any reasonable 

basis, as long as they have a reasonable basis, they can 

dispense with all the provisions of Connecticut civil 

service law, all these provisions that were put in place 

to get rid of cronyism, to get rid of discrimination can 

be set aside based on nothing more than a numerical 

disparity or perhaps a concern about the test we think 

cuts against Congress's intent in Title VII in 

respecting these State and local laws that are intended

 JUSTICE BREYER: Do you -- I'm still back on 

-- a university decides that tenure requirements lead to 

fewer women professors, so they say as an experiment 

what we would like to do is not have them for a couple 

of years; see what happens. On your view is that 

unconstitutional? Because, after all, it will certainly 

mean that certain majority race assistant professors 

have now lost the promotion they otherwise would have.

university. Now, suppose they just decided, you know

of the 10 percent rule itself, most people believe --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you said no. Can 

Texas do that or not?

 MR. COLEMAN: Likely, yes. The answer is --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. COLEMAN: -- it can do it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. And the difference 

here precisely is what?

 MR. COLEMAN: Is that, under State law, 

these individuals had gone through an existing process 

and had -- under State law, had been determined to be 

the most qualified candidates and, barring anything 

else, would have been promoted. So the classification 

that is made clearly does distinguish between those who 

are qualified for promotion and those who are not 

qualified for promotion and would not receive.

 It violates that -- that singular principle

of individual dignity to have these individuals be told, 

on the basis of race, you're not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if it were shown 

that, in fact, this test was not job-related and, in 

fact, the majority of fire departments scotched this 

test years ago and substituted what most agree is a 

better test, even so you would say it would violate the 

rights of the plaintiffs you represent, even --

MR. COLEMAN: If --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even if there's strong 

evidence that it's not job-related and that there's a 

better test that doesn't produce these skewed results?

 MR. COLEMAN: I don't think that's what 

we've said, Justice Ginsburg. Under our alternative 

formulation in which the Court recognizes --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what -- what would 

that do to the civil service merit system that says if 

you pass the test you should be certified?

 MR. COLEMAN: The difference is this, 

Justice Ginsburg: The example you have given would 

clearly satisfy or likely satisfy a strong basis in 

evidence that you are actually in violation of the 

disparate impact provision of Title VII. There are 

three prongs. The first is adverse impact; the second 

is that your test is not related; and the third is the

existence of this alternative that is equally valid and 

that results in lower disparate impact.

 The City has never asserted -- and I hear it 

today continue to say, we don't have to show those other 

two prongs, that a numerical disparity enough may allow 

the City to conclude that there must be something wrong 

with the test. This kind of res ipsa loquitur theory of 

disparate impact is one that the courts have not 

recognized and that Watson said we cannot allow because 

it results in racial balancing and soft quotas based on 

disparate impact --

JUSTICE BREYER: But in your -- in my 

example, to go back, the thing you've identified, it 

seems to me, is Texas couldn't do this. It couldn't 

look at the class that they're going to choose with the 

10 percent and say, you know, there are not enough 

minorities, I think we'll go to 15 percent this year.

 MR. COLEMAN: That I agree with, Justice 

Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It could not. And 

moreover, in the case of the tenure, what the school 

couldn't do is it couldn't say, looking over at the 

present tenured faculty and those who were just ready 

for promotion and who in all probability will be, we're 

going to go to the non-tenure system this year. We're

going to go to the non-tenure system this year.

 MR. COLEMAN: I also agree with that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That they couldn't do that. 

And again you that say the ordinary employer across 

America who announces a deadline for getting in 

applications cannot, once it sees those applications, 

say, you know, there are not enough minorities. I want 

to extend the deadline.

 MR. COLEMAN: That's also correct, Justice 

Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And therefore 

this is a very far-reaching decision.

 MR. COLEMAN: No, not necessarily, Your 

Honor. Okay, what --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You are -- you are saying, 

as I understand it, that if the -- if the city in a case 

like this, prior to giving a test, looked at the test 

and says, wait a minute, this is going to produce really 

disparate results, they can stop, regroup, and think it 

through again and maybe come up with a different test.

 MR. COLEMAN: If --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But if they don't realize 

that and they go ahead with the test, and they then see 

the -- the disparate results, it's too late. And it 

seems to me that the trouble with drawing that

distinction is that the city is not in the testing 

business. They are unlikely to know what the results 

are going to be. So you're saying that the city that is 

-- that is prescient can adjust, the city that doesn't 

find out there's something wrong or at least undesirable 

from their standpoint until after the test results 

cannot readjust?

 MR. COLEMAN: I don't think that's our 

position, Justice Souter. The first case I think is the 

hypothetical Justice Kennedy posed to me. The second 

case, as we've been talking about, is that you identify 

the disparate impact after the test has been given. 

Under this alternative theory that would allow a -- an 

employer to respond, all we are asking under the strong 

basis in evidence test is that you not react out of a 

concern, or out of this mere reaction to the numbers, 

but that you then look, is the test valid? Do you have 

convincing evidence, in the words of Wygant, to form a 

strong basis in evidence that if you did go forward --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But if they see it coming, 

they don't have to show a strong basis in evidence for 

changing the test prior to the time they give it?

 MR. COLEMAN: Consistent with what -- my 

conversation with Justice Breyer, if they see it coming 

and do it ahead of time, it doesn't violate that
