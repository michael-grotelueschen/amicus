 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 06-11429, Burgess versus 

United States.

 Mr. Fisher.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FISHER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The rule of lenity requires that any penal 

statute the government seeks to enforce against an 

individual must clearly and unambiguous apply to him 

and, as the government acknowledges its brief in this 

case, this Court has applied the rule of lenity in 

numerous recent cases involving mandatory sentencing 

provisions. A reaffirmation of that time-honored 

principle is all that is necessary to decide this case.

 The 20-year mandatory --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it time-honored since 

Granderson? Is that the first time we did it?

 MR. FISHER: Well, the rule of lenity has 

been --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: As to sentences? As to 

sentences?

MR. FISHER: As to sentencing? No, in the 

mid-20th century, Justice Kennedy, in the Bell decision 

written by Justice Frankfurter and in Ladner, both 

involved the degree of punishment which the defendant 

would receive. There are other cases: In 1980 the 

Simpson case, and Bifulco around the same time. So this 

Court has a history of applying the rule of lenity with 

equal force to sentencing provisions as it does to 

statutes demarcating criminal conduct or not. And of 

course, as the green brief specially highlights, the 

very essence and the core of the rule of lenity derives 

from the English common law, which is -- which was 

designed to invoke the rule of lenity to avoid mandatory 

punishment, not -- not so much whether conduct was 

criminal or not.

 So we think that applying that rule in a 

straightforward manner to this case requires a reversal. 

The 20-year mandatory minimum in Section 841(b)(1)(A) 

applies only to defendants who have a prior conviction 

for a, quote, "felony drug offense." Now, a sensible 

reading of that provision is that a State law 

misdemeanor simply does not constitute a felony drug 

offense.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but if the 

rule of lenity depends upon of course some ambiguity in

the term, the definition says "'felony drug offense' 

means an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for 

more than 1 year." It doesn't say anything about State 

classification.

 MR. FISHER: That's right, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and if that's all you had on the statute books 

this might be an easier case. But as you know, I think, 

above section 44 and section 13 the term "felony" is 

described and defined as "a crime that is classified as 

a felony under Federal or State law." And so when you 

start with section 841(b)(1)(A), which uses the term 

"felony drug offense," and you go to the definitional 

section, the first thing you come to is the definition 

of felony, which says a crime classified as such. And 

then, as you say, in section 44 you reach another 

definition. So we think that at the very least you have 

an ambiguity here in which Congress has given two 

facially applicable definitions to the operative 

provision of the statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, obviously one 

is a definition of "felony" and the other is the 

definition of "felony drug offense" and the term that's 

at issue here is "felony drug offense."

 MR. FISHER: Well, in a sense it's our 

position that both are at issue here. The term

"felony," which is within the term "felony drug 

offense," is also at issue here. And as we've pointed 

out in pages 11 and 12, 11 and 12 of our yellow brief, 

it's not uncommon for Congress to have two separate 

definitions one of which is a single term within a 

broader term in a statute. And so the mere fact, as the 

government would argue, that the word "felony" is not 

repeated in the definition of subsection 44 does not 

mean that Congress meant that to be the sole definition.

 We've given three examples on pages 11 and 

12 where the sensible reading of the statute is that 

Congress attempted to nest the definition of a single 

term within the definition of a broader term.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Could I -- could I ask you 

what you think Congress might have been trying to do 

with the 1994 amendment under -- under your reading? 

Before 1994 the offense had to be classified as a 

felony. Then they added this definition of "felony drug 

offense," and as I understand it your reading is that 

now the offense must be classified as a felony and it 

must be punishable by more, by imprisonment for more 

than a year. What would be the reason for adding this 

new requirement as you see it, that it be punishable by 

more than a year, if there were not offenses that were 

classified by States as felonies but were punishable by

less than a year? I can't see the point unless the 

point was to rule those out.

 And you haven't cited any State statute in 

your brief that involved an offense that was classified 

as a felony and is punishable by less than a year. You 

cited a couple that were punishable by exactly a year, 

not more than a year but exactly a year. So is it your, 

your theory that the reason for adding this new language 

was to make it clear that those offenses where the 

maximum was 12 months, as opposed to 12 months and a 

day, would not be counted?

 MR. FISHER: I think there is an agreement 

between us and the government on this point. We cite in 

our blue brief statutes from Arizona as well as a couple 

of other States where there are crimes that are 

classified as felonies but punishable in less than a 

year. And in those cases we agree with the government 

that that is the effect of the 1994 conforming 

amendments, is to exclude those outlier States that take 

low-level crimes and nonetheless classify them as 

felonies. What this case is about --

JUSTICE ALITO: But if I could just come 

back to that. I looked at those. You cite Ohio, North 

Carolina, and Arizona and those are all punishable by --

they all have a maximum term of 12 months, not less

than. So the difference is between 12 months and 12 

months and a day?

 MR. FISHER: Well, that works on the 

language of the statute, Justice Alito.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But is it plausible that's 

the reason why Congress added this language? They 

didn't want -- they wanted to make sure that these 

felonies that were punishable by just 12 months would 

not be counted?

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think it is quite 

plausible that the language that Congress added has very 

little practical effect. And that flows from the fact 

that Congress called these nothing more than conforming 

amendments, so Congress apparently wasn't trying to 

accomplish any dramatic change here and I think it might 

help to understand by looking at the other outlier 

states that the government claims got swept in with the 

1994 amendments. We cite statutes from States like 

Colorado. Perhaps if I used a concrete example. Take 

possession of a single ounce of marijuana. That is one 

of the crimes in Arizona that we were just talking 

about, that is a felony punishable by no more than a 

year. There are a few other States who are outliers in 

a different sense, in which they call these crimes 

misdemeanors, like the vast majority of States, but make

them punishable by 18 months or more.

 And so what the government's position is is 

that in 1994 when Congress passed a conforming amendment 

to exclude a couple of outlier States like Arizona, it 

was trying to sweep in for the first time into section 

841(b)(1)(A) outlier States like Colorado that treat 

low-level drug crimes, low-level drug possession crimes, 

as misdemeanors that are punishable by more than a year.

 So we think, for the very reasons the 

government explains, that Congress is trying to avoid 

disuniformity and happenstance according to how a few 

local jurisdictions might treat certain drug crimes, 

that it makes sense to read the '94 conforming 

amendments as requiring both the one-year punishment 

rule and the felony classification requirement.

 And if you have any doubt on that, we submit 

it really makes sense to remember that what we're what 

talking about here is a mandatory minimum. And so --

JUSTICE ALITO: What would you do with 

someone who was convicted -- had a prior conviction of 

-- for importing 10 tons of heroin in New Jersey, for 

example, where there are no felonies? What would you do 

with that, a very serious drug offense in a State that 

doesn't use the term "felony" at all or a foreign 

conviction?

MR. FISHER: Well, we've cited a case in our 

brief in the Second Circuit that deals with that exact 

problem, at least with the New Jersey problem. And what 

the courts did and what they have done in other 

circumstances where there's a felony classification 

requirement is they simply take the crime in New Jersey 

and analogize it to a comparable Federal or local State 

crime, and if it was -- if it would be classified as a 

felony in that local jurisdiction, then courts -- and 

this is even before the 1994 amendments -- courts have 

treated it as a felony.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But what they did -- what 

they did in the Second Circuit case was to say this is 

punishable -- this offense is punishable by more than a 

year in New Jersey and therefore it's a felony.

 MR. FISHER: I believe, Justice Alito, this 

was a case before 1994, so that's --

JUSTICE ALITO: I know. And that's how they 

analogized it to a felony.

 MR. FISHER: Right, because that is the 

Federal definition of a felony, and so that was the 

analogy that the Second Circuit was able to draw here 

and reach what we think is a commonsense way to deal 

with the unusual problem of New Jersey. Another --

examples where a -- a noun that is nested in another 

definition is separately defined and the two are read 

together. How are those phrased? I mean, I could 

understand what you say if this provision here read "The 

term 'felony drug offense' means a felony that is 

punishable by imprisonment for more than one year." 

Then I'd go back to the "felony" definition for what a 

felony means, but it doesn't repeat the "felony." "The 

term 'felony drug offense' means an offense that is 

punishable by imprisonment for" -- do any of the 

examples of nesting that you -- that you bring forward 

read this way?

 MR. FISHER: All three of them do, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which ones are they? Where 

are they --

MR. FISHER: They're pages 11 and 12 of the 

yellow brief. And so the first place to start is 

looking at the bottom of page 11, where the term 

"employee" is defined in one provision of the Federal --

of the Federal statutory code. And then the terms 

"employee of the Capitol Police," "employee of the House 

of Representatives" are also defined, and they're 

defined -- and those broader definitions are in the 

footnote at the bottom of page 12. And so you see that

there, after having defined the term "employee," the 

word "employee" is not repeated in those definitions. 

They talk about "a member" or "an officer" or "an 

individual." And so it's much like the circumstance 

here, where a more generic term is used in the broader 

definition, but it makes sense to read in the original 

definition.

 The same thing I think you can see in the 

middle of page 12 with the part of the Bankruptcy Code 

that we've given this Court. The word "debtor" is 

defined in a certain way, and then later on in the 

definitional provision, the term "debtor's principal 

residence" is defined as "a residential structure" and 

such and such. Again the word "debtor" is not repeated 

in the broader definition, but we think the only way to 

make sense of it is to import the definition of the 

single term into the broader term. If Congress had 

wanted --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just on that -- just 

on that last one, are you saying that if it doesn't say 

"debtor's residential structure," you'd think it was 

somebody else's residential structure?

 MR. FISHER: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand 

the point.

MR. FISHER: Well, there might be, you know, 

a very rigid plain-text argument that might be made. 

The point is that Congress used -- defined the term 

"debtor's principal residence" without using the term 

"debtor" again and defined it somewhere else. My --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, in a provision 

of the Bankruptcy Code that deals with debtors I don't 

think there's any question about whose residential 

structure they would be talking about, even though they 

don't repeat "debtor." It strikes me as quite different 

than the provision we have before us today.

 MR. FISHER: Well, then I think I'd refer 

you back to the employee example. I mean, no example is 

going to be exactly on all fours. I'm happy to 

acknowledge that. The idea that I'm trying to get 

across is it's not unusual for Congress to define single 

terms that are nested within larger terms.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- better example. It 

doesn't quite work because it does not supersede the 

term "debtor" that was used earlier. In the 

government's submission at least in this case, "felony 

drug offense" supersedes the earlier provision in 

section 13.

 MR. FISHER: I think that's right. And I

think one way to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it seems to me they're 

not comparable in that sense.

 MR. FISHER: Okay. I think one way to 

understand how this statute -- if Congress had wanted to 

do what the government says it wanted to do, how 

Congress could have made it absolutely clear -- while we 

have the yellow brief open, we can look at page 13.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask you a question 

before going on with this line? You say that both the 

802(13) definition has to be satisfied and the 44 

definition, right? But was 802(13) ever applicable to 

this situation? What was the law prior to the 1994 

amendment? There was a section, wasn't there, that 

defined "felony drug offense"?

 MR. FISHER: For a time, yes, Justice 

Ginsburg, but -- so when the statute was originally 

passed, 802(13) was the sole definition of "felony," and 

then somewhere along the line between the original 

enactment and the '94 amendments, a definition of 

"felony drug offense" was put into 841(b)(1)(A) --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.

 MR. FISHER: -- but that itself just used 

the word "felony," which again referred the reader back 

to 802(13). So, again, I think there is an agreement

between --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you take a look at 

that provision that was in 841(b)(1)? Because it seems 

that it would be duplicative of 802(13).

 MR. FISHER: Are you looking, Justice 

Ginsburg, at the 1988 version of the statute?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. FISHER: No, because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where would we find this?

 MR. FISHER: Oh, this is at 13a of the blue 

brief, Justice Scalia.

 So, at page 13a it says, "For purposes of 

this subparagraph, the term 'felony drug offense' means 

an offense that is a felony under any provision of this 

subchapter, under any Federal law." Now, the word 

"felony" again would have referred the reader back to 

802(13). If I understand --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But read -- read the end 

of it. Read on where it says, "or a felony under any 

law of a State or foreign country," et cetera.

 MR. FISHER: Right. But I think, again, the 

word "felony" as it appears in -- in that provision --

and I think that the government agrees with us on this 

-- would have referred the reader back to 802(13) as of 

1988 --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what --

MR. FISHER: -- because there isn't the 

explicit classification requirement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it defines what the 

felony is: "A felony under any law of a State or 

foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct 

relating to narcotic drugs, marijuana," et cetera.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think the latter 

language, Justice Ginsburg, is defining --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would you need to 

look --

MR. FISHER: -- "drug offense," whereas the 

word "felony" I think is not a self-defining term in 

that statute as it's written. And to understand whether 

we're talking about something like a one-year rule or a 

classification requirement, the reader needs to go back 

to the definitional section.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't -- the definitional 

section contradicts -- contradicts what's in (b)(1)(A).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. FISHER: As of 1988?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. It contradicts it 

because the "felony" definition is classified as felony 

by Federal or State law.

 MR. FISHER: Well, it says "a felony under

the law of a State." So I think the classification 

requirement -- I don't think it's inconsistent with it. 

It might clarify it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is "under any 

provision of this subchapter or any other Federal law 

that prohibits or restricts." And then in the last 

part, "under any law of a" -- of "State" -- it picks up 

"State" -- "or a foreign country." "Foreign country" is 

not included in 802(13).

 MR. FISHER: That's right, Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you have to say that 

there "felony" stands on its own, right?

 MR. FISHER: Well, I guess you could, but 

then you wouldn't have a definition; then you'd have to 

figure out how to define "felony," whether it was a 

classification or a one-year rule or something else. I 

think the natural reading, again, would be a 

classification requirement to the extent to which you 

couldn't look further than that provision of the 

statute, but --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is the following true, that 

if you are right the reason Congress passed this new 

definition was it wanted to take those handful of States 

which have felonies as a year, the ones Justice Alito is 

talking about, and make clear that they are not covered?

MR. FISHER: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But if the 

government's right, then the reason Congress did this is 

that it recognized what I think is the truth, that 

felonies and misdemeanors are defined differently in 

many different ways under the laws of many different 

States and, in a matter where so much prison time turns 

on it, wished to create a single, uniform definition.

 Now, if that's right, I'm asking myself 

which is a more plausible purpose.

 MR. FISHER: Well, we don't disagree with 

the government that the one-year rule does serve the 

purpose of helping iron out --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, it doesn't, because if 

you're right, then you first have to look to the 

patchwork quilt of laws in all the different States to 

see whether those different States define the conduct as 

misdemeanors or felonies. And then, having solved the 

patchwork problem, we add on the requirement of one 

year. And so the bite of the new definition would be 

what Justice Alito said and nothing else.

 Now, that's -- and, yet, on the government's 

interpretation, the bite is to create a single, readily 

applied, uniform rule.

 Now, if I ask myself which of those is most

plausible, I hate to tell you which answer I get.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think, Justice Breyer, 

with due respect, if you look at the way different 

States treat drug crimes --

JUSTICE BREYER: Am I right? Am I right? I 

mean, I put that out to give you a chance to say. I'm 

not sure I am right.

 MR. FISHER: That's what I'm trying to 

respond -- different States treat drug crimes 

dramatically different, and this is so -- I think it's 

common sense that States treat different crimes -- treat 

-- different States punish the same crime differently. 

And that's nowhere more true than in drug crime, because 

there's a great amount of experimentation that goes on 

in the States. And one of the things that certain 

States do, like Colorado, is take very low-level drug 

crimes and punish them by more than a year, in part so 

they can give treatment and keep people in, prison, long 

enough to have treatment take hold, whereas some other 

States treat drug crimes very differently. So you have 

a patchwork whether you look to the classification or 

whether you look to the one-year rule. That's why we 

think it makes sense to use both.

 Now, if Congress had wanted to do what the 

government is suggesting, which is have the one-year

rule be the sole and exclusive way of determining 

whether you have a felony before you, it could have very 

easily said so. And there's an example -- and this is 

at page 13 of the yellow brief -- of what -- of what the 

Federal Sentencing Guidelines do.

 They define -- in a "career-offender 

provision" there is a definition of "felony" there that 

is quite explicit. They say a "felony" is "an offense 

punishable by more than a year, regardless of whether 

such an offense is specifically designated as a 

'felony.'"

 So there are other provisions where Congress 

could have looked and it would have been well aware of 

how to make absolutely plain what it was trying to 

accomplish in the statute.

 Now, we don't think that the government's 

reading is implausible, Justice Breyer, for the reason 

--.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Fisher, could I just 

go back to what you quoted. Are you quoting -- you're 

quoting a Sentencing Guideline, right?

 MR. FISHER: Yes.

Guideline, although in the Armed Career Criminal Act you

can find another place where Congress dealt with this 

problem explicitly.

 It said that felonies are crimes punishable 

more than a year; however, if the State classifies the 

crime as a misdemeanor, it has to be punishable by more 

than two years.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You think -- you think it 

would mean something different if you just left out the 

"regardless of" clause?

 MR. FISHER: Well, Justice Scalia, with the 

problem --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The "prior adult Federal or 

State conviction for an offense punishable by death or 

imprisonment for a term exceeding one year," you think 

it means something different without the "regardless".

 MR. FISHER: Not necessarily, but leaving 

that clause --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not at all? Not possibly.

 MR. FISHER: Well, our position is, Justice 

Scalia, that, standing alone, I will grant you; but the 

problem as we see it in this case is that that is left 

out. In a very common problem, how to define a felony, 

they leave out that explicit statement of whether 

classification is important. And what is more, in the 

same definitional provision --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I would say that 

"regardless" clause is extraordinary and I would not 

want to have to deal with such prolix statutes on a 

regular basis.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think there's a good 

reason why Congress put it in, and that's because it is 

a continually vexing problem, how to define what is a 

felony. That's why Congress did it explicitly in the 

Armed Career Criminal Act. That's why the Sentencing 

Guidelines are explicit here. And leaving that out, and 

against the backdrop of a statute where the 

classification rule was the controlling rule for over a 

decade, and where they leave that classification rule in 

the very same definitional provision of the statute, we 

think, gives rise to an ambiguity.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's such a 

vexing problem, why would Congress have incorporated the 

problem into the definition of "felony drug offense"?

 MR. FISHER: Well, I'm not sure I follow the 

question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you seem to 

suggest that it's a vexing problem that "felony" is 

defined differently in different States. And, yet, you 

say that the term "felony," which relies on how it's 

defined by different States, was incorporated in the

felony drug offense, which seems to have a quite clear 

definition of punishable by more than one year.

 If they don't want to repeat the problem 

that "felony" is defined differently in different 

States, they would not do what you're suggesting, which 

is incorporate it wholesale into the latter definition.

 MR. FISHER: Well, with all due respect, 

what Congress did is they left 802(13) on the books, 

which does turn on classifications. And it's not --

even though it is a -- it is something of a patchwork, 

it is not unusual at all to have very serious 

consequences turn on whether something is classified as 

a "felony" or not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, of course, they had 

to leave it on the books because they need a definition 

of "felony." "Felony" has to be defined in many places, 

but this is a definition of "felony drug offense." So 

MR. FISHER: Well, again, Justice Ginsburg, 

I think that is right. But then what Congress could 

have done is use the language that the Federal 

Sentencing Guidelines use, or something comparable to 

make clear its intent.

 And the classification of a felony or not a 

felony, as this Court knows, has a time-honored import.

Things like the right to vote, the right to bear arms, 

the right to various civil rights turn on whether 

somebody has been convicted of a felony or a 

misdemeanor.

 And, again, this brings us in a sense back 

to the rule of lenity because one of the principal 

reasons for the rule of lenity is fair notice. Now, 

this Court, as early as the McBoyle decision recognized 

that we're dealing with something of a fiction when we 

imagine an offender is looking at the statutory books to 

decide whether certain conduct is prohibited or not.

 But in the context of recidivist 

enhancements that lead to mandatory minimums, we're 

talking about very real and serious notice problems. 

Imagine the conscientious public defender advising 

someone like Mr. Burgess as to whether he should plead 

guilty to a misdemeanor or a felony. This happens in 

States across the country that have three-strike 

provisions, that have very serious immigration 

consequences turning on "felony" or "misdemeanor." That 

lawyer might have concluded, as the District of Columbia 

Circuit did, that pleading to a misdemeanor here would 

not expose Mr. Burgess in the event he was convicted of 

a later crime to such a serious punishment as the 

20-year mandatory minimum in this case.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me what 

happened in South Carolina? Could he on those facts and 

under the charges have been sentenced to more than a 

year? It was just that the judge gave him less than a 

year?

 MR. FISHER: Mr. Burgess's crime, possession 

of cocaine, was punishable by up to two years. So, yes, 

he received a sentence far less than that.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But he, himself, was 

eligible for the --

MR. FISHER: Yes. The crime to which he 

pled guilty was punishable by two years. But you should 

understand that that kind of hypothetical, punishable-by 

problem is one I know this Court dealt with a couple of 

months ago in the Rodriguez case. And you should 

understand that not just what Congress, under the 

government's view, had been looking to sweep in outlier 

States like Colorado, but if the government prevails in 

the Rodriguez case where the term "punishable by" turns 

on recidivist enhancements, then the 1994 amendments, 

which were termed "conforming amendments," have an even 

far more sweeping effect and bring in lots of State-law 

misdemeanors that were never covered by the prior act.

 If there are no more questions, I will

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Just one. You said that 

in most States what Burgess did, his crime, simple 

possession, would not encounter a sentence of upward of 

one year. Did you do a survey? Did you document that 

in your brief?

 MR. FISHER: No. But I said earlier, 

Justice Ginsburg, giving the example of possession of 

one ounce of marijuana, that the vast majority of States 

punished that as a misdemeanor by less than a year.

 Mr. Burgess's crime, at best, was a 

misdemeanor punishable by less than a year under Federal 

law, but different States treat that crime differently. 

And I think a majority of those, a majority of States, 

would treat that as a crime punishable by more than a 

year and classified as a "felony.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE SAHARSKY

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

please the Court:

 Congress answered the question presented in 

this case when it adopted an express definition for 

"felony drug offense." Under that definition, "felony

drug offense" means an offense punishable by more than 

one year of imprisonment under certain State, Federal, 

or foreign drug laws.

 There is no textual basis for going beyond 

that definition to also require that an offense be 

classified as a "felony." The enhancement trigger in 

the sentencing-enhancement provision is a felony drug 

offense, and the way that the definition works is that 

you take the definition Congress provided for "felony 

drug offense."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is "drug" a nested 

term in that? It doesn't really define "drug." Do they 

look somewhere else for that definition?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Well, the term "felony drug 

offense," the "drug" component we understand to be the 

component that says "an offense" that prohibits --

"under law that prohibits or restricts conduct related 

to narcotic drugs, marijuana, anabolic steroids" --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there a place you 

would -- is that a place you would look if you didn't 

know what they meant by "drug"? If an issue arose 

whether, you know, a natural narcotic, I mean is that a 

drug or not?

 MS. SAHARSKY: There is a definition of 

"drug" at the beginning of the Controlled Substances Act

in section 802. It refers back to the general 

definition of "drug," I believe in section 321 of the 

Controlled --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that is nested in 

this definition, "felony drug offense"?

 MS. SAHARSKY: The term "felony drug 

offense" has only the meaning that Congress gave to it. 

In the words it shows that it be punishable by more than 

one year under State, Federal or foreign law relating to 

those particular drugs.

 In fact, the question that you asked shows 

why Petitioner's reading of the statute cannot be 

correct, that you can't use both the definition of 

"felony drug offense" that Congress provided and try to 

import in separate definitions for "felony" and separate 

definitions for "drug," because the definition of "drug" 

in the Controlled Substances Act is very broad and 

applies to many different kinds of drugs, whereas the 

definition of "felony drug offense" only refers to 

offenses that involve narcotic drugs, anabolic steroids, 

marijuana or depressant or stimulant substances.

 In the same way, this shows why Petitioner 

cannot be correct that the definition of "felony" also 

must be brought into "felony drug offense," because 

Congress chose that the measure of seriousness in

"felony drug offense" is an offense punishable by more 

than one year. And it actually took out of the statute 

the measure of seriousness which is classification as a 

felony. So to bring that requirement back in would undo 

the change that Congress made in 1994.

 That's the language, Justice Ginsburg, that 

we were looking at at the bottom of the -- at the back 

of the blue book. In 1988 it said "'Felony drug 

offense' means an offense which is a felony." And that 

language was taken out and Congress replaced it with 

this new language, which says "punishable by more than 

one year of imprisonment."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you do with 

your friend's argument that the classification -- or the 

term, more than one year or less than one year, doesn't 

always have to do with how serious they view the 

offense, but they may impose a sentence of more than one 

year to allow time for rehabilitation?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Congress chose the words that 

it did, "punishable by more than one year," because it 

believed it to be a good measure of seriousness. This 

Court has recognized in cases like Blanton versus City 

of North Las Vegas that the term of imprisonment that a 

legislature chooses is a good measure of the seriousness 

of the offense. There may be offenses that a State

classifies as more or less serious based on punishment, 

but Congress wanted to do its best to get uniformity in 

provision -- in this provision. So what it did here was 

to take out this requirement that would look to varying 

State and foreign laws and instead have one that was 

just based on term of imprisonment.

 And actually this -- this raises a very 

serious problem with Petitioner's reading of the 

statute, which is with respect to foreign offenses. The 

"felony drug offense" definition allows an enhancement 

based on State, Federal or foreign offenses, and the 

definition of "felony" unadorned and standing by itself 

doesn't refer to foreign offenses at all, which means 

that there is a serious ambiguity if both apply as to 

what would be done in the case of trying to enhance 

based on a foreign offense.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, I suppose it might 

for countries that use that classification, for common 

law countries.

 MS. SAHARSKY: There are countries that do 

use the felony- misdemeanor distinction. There are some 

that do not. But we understand in 1994 that Congress --

the change Congress made to be one that eliminates those 

kinds of ambiguities.

1994 that both the separate definition of felony and the 

definition of felony drug offense mattered, that it 

would have placed foreign offenses in the definition of 

felony, and it didn't do that here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the information we 

have in the brief says that there are two States that 

have dropped those labels. Are there more than New 

Jersey and Maine?

 MS. SAHARSKY: New Jersey and Maine are the 

only ones that I'm aware of.

 Certainly, as this Court discussed in some 

previous questions, there may be ways in which courts 

could try to work around ambiguities that, for example, 

existed in the statute 1990 -- prior to 1994, to figure 

out how offenses in New Jersey should be treated. But 

the fact that Congress made the change in 1994 to pick 

clear language that would just turn on the authorized 

term of imprisonment shows that that's what should be 

used, that choice should be given effect.

 The fact that courts might be able to deal 

with an ambiguous statute certainly does not give 

license to create one where it doesn't otherwise exist.

 There's an example the Petitioner raised, 

which is how violent felonies are treated in the Armed 

Career Criminal Act, and I think that that -- that

illustrates how Congress could have done what Petitioner 

wanted if that was, in fact, its intent. In the ACCA, a 

violent felony, which could be the basis for a sentence 

enhancement, is defined as various violent offenses that 

are punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year. But 

then Congress specifically decided that it wanted to 

exempt state misdemeanor offenses that it didn't 

consider serious enough to qualify as violent felonies. 

So it exempted State offenses that are classified as 

misdemeanors and punishable by less than two years. And 

we think that the Congress' treatment in the ACCA 

exempting specific State offenses shows that if Congress 

had wanted to exempt offenses classified as misdemeanors 

in the way that Petitioner suggests, then it would have 

done so in that way.

 Congress chose a meaning here for "felony 

drug offense" and we think that it needs to be given 

effect.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you tell us just a 

little bit about the rule of lenity? You want us to 

apply sort of a watered down discount rule of lenity in 

sentencing cases? And do you have authority for that?

or modifying it at all.

 MS. SAHARSKY: The government's position is 

that the rule of lenity operates in the same manner in 

both the defining the offense context and in the 

sentencing context. The point that we were making in 

our brief is that the purposes behind the rule of lenity 

are really implicated to a lesser extent when we're 

talking about sentencing, and particularly with respect 

to mandatory minimums, because there's not a question of 

whether the offense conduct at issue is illegal, and 

there's not a question about the maximum offense, the 

maximum term of imprisonment that the person could be 

subject to.

 So, our brief should be best understood as a 

response to Petitioner's extensive historical discussion 

of the rule of lenity and a suggestion that it applies 

with even more vigor in the context of mandatory 

minimums. We don't think that that's the case, but at 

the same time we are not suggesting there is a new 

different rule of lenity in this context.

 And again, we don't see this as a rule of 

lenity case. Congress picked a particular definition 

and it used those terms -- that term "felony drug 

offense" to trigger each of the sentencing enhancement 

provisions here. We don't think there is any reason to

this Court to lose sight of the importance of the rule

position that our reading of the statute is a possible 

one and that Congress may have been --

a real ambiguity. I mean, if there is a plausible 

defendant-friendly interpretation, that doesn't trigger 

the rule of lenity, does it or doesn't it?

fair way to ask yourself the question is, would the 

statute here rise to the level of a plain statement of a 

kind that is required to, for example, abrogate

JUSTICE SCALIA: How many statutes exist 

like that, my goodness? You want the government to be

Scalia, that's what the historical cases say.

lenity means.

you look at the examples in Blackstone, that's the 

Greenbury cite, if you look at this Court's earliest 

cases, Chief Justice Marshall wrote for the court in 

Wiltberger that even though it's extremely improbable 

that Congress wanted the result that the defendant 

presses, the Court is nevertheless going to insist on 

it, because it is not unambiguously clear this was 

Congress' intent.

 And so, it's easy to forget given the modern 

proliferation of Federal criminal statutes how rare 

criminal cases used to be in this court.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think this is very 

important, Justice Scalia, your cases, especially the 

historical cases and the modern ones, I think, waffle in 

different directions, but there are plenty of cases from 

this Court that are much more than a tie-breaker in the 

sense of the rule of lenity and say, we require clear 

and definite terms, that's the phrase Justice 

Frankfurter used to repeat. Justice Holmes said the 

statute must be clear. Even up to Granderson it says --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That was in a context 

where the question was whether or not the conduct was 

criminal at all not since.

 MR. FISHER: That's right. But for the 

reason --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you apply clear 

statement rule to the sentencing code, I don't think we 

are going to be able to get beyond the second sentence.

 MR. FISHER: Well, I think with due respect 

what you're going to do is actually reduce the number of 

cases this court hears, because once you have a clear 

statement rule, two things are going to happen. The 

lower courts are going to find it more -- easier to

resolve these kinds of cases because just like in the 

sovereign immunity and Federalism context, it's much 

easier to look for a clear statement. And even more 

importantly, Congress will know that when it legislates 

in the realm of criminal sentencing, that it needs to be 

clear, and it will solve this case -- this Court the 

problem, perhaps, of having four or five cases on its 

docket every term involving circuit splits and how to 

apply mandatory minimums in the vast labyrinth of 

Federal criminal sentencing provisions.

 So we think this Court can rest assured, of 

course, that if it rules for the Petitioner in this case 

and Congress doesn't like the result, that it is well 

and able and ready to step in to solve that problem. 

The problem is, is that if this Court accepts broad 

readings of the government, from the government of 

criminal statutes, that the institutional forces that 

drive legislation are -- make it much less likely that 

Congress can step in to solve that problem in favor of 

criminal defendants.

 So for the reasons we've explained, we think 

this Court should go back to the historical 

understanding brought forward to the present of the 

importance of the rule of lenity, and in this case find 

that the statute does not clearly and unambiguously

 If there are no further questions, I'll
