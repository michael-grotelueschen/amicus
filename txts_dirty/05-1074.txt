 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 

argument next in Ledbetter versus Goodyear Tire & 

Rubber Company.

 Mr. Russell.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL, 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. RUSSELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court.

 A jury found that at the time petitioner 

filed for charge of discrimination with the EEOC, 

respondent was paying her less for each week's work 

than it paid similarly situated male employees and 

that it did so because of her sex. The question for 

the Court is whether that present act of disparate 

treatment because of sex constituted a present 

violation of Title VII. This Court has already 

answered that question.

 Consistent with the law's traditional 

treatment of pay as arising from recurring 

transactions and giving rise to recurring causes of 

action, and consistent with the paycheck accrual rule 

everyone agrees Congress adopted for the Equal Pay 

Act, this Court in Bazemore versus Friday held under

Title VII, each week's paycheck that offers less to 

an employee because of her race or sex --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But are you saying that 

the rule for paycheck decisions is different than the 

rule for other sorts of decisions?

 MR. RUSSELL: It -- it is. For example, 

the respondents give the example of promotion 

decisions but we think that there are analytical and 

well as practical and historical distinctions that 

Congress, that led Congress to treat pay differently. 

As a practical matter, while it's always the case or 

almost always the case that somebody knows they have 

been subject to disparate treatment in a promotion 

case -- they know that they didn't get the promotion 

and somebody else did -- -it is frequently possible 

for an employee to be subject to disparate pay 

without ever knowing that she has been treated 

differently than anybody else. And certainly --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That seems to me to work 

the other way around, just like the case we've just 

heard argued in the last hour. It's a question of 

specificity here. If the, if the employee, he 

alleges that promotions were based on experience and 

the employee didn't have the experience because of 

past discrimination, why is that different than the

paycheck rule? I take it indicates that you would 

not allow the, a cause of action unless the 

discrimination was within the statute of limitations 

period?

 MR. RUSSELL: Yes. Yes. A promotion --

discrimination in promotion is different analytically 

than with discrimination with respect to pay 

decisions themselves. Because in a promotion 

decision the employee is deprived of the opportunity 

to take on added responsibilities and therefore earn 

more pay, but in, but the pay itself is not 

discriminatory in the sense of treating people doing 

the same work differently.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't really see a vast 

difference between a promotion and being elevated to 

a higher pay grade. I mean, there may be no 

different responsibilities but it's a single act of 

discrimination: "No, you're not going to move up to 

the next pay level." I don't see why that's 

different from "no, you're not going to move up to 

the next job."

 MR. RUSSELL: Because, I think the 

difference is that when somebody is denied a 

promotion for discriminatory reasons the paychecks 

themselves are not discriminatory. They treat

similarly situated workers differently.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Russell, I thought 

that your argument was that yes, you know that you 

haven't got the promotion, you know you haven't got 

the transfer, but the spread in the pay is an 

incremental thing. You may think the first year you 

didn't get a raise, "well, so be it." But you have, 

you have no reason to think that there is going to be 

this inequality. I mean she started out getting the 

same pay, right?

 MR. RUSSELL: Yes, and that practical 

distinction I think does support Congress's decision 

under the Equal Pay Act as well as under Title VII to 

choose a paycheck accrual rule because it's 

frequently that even if an employee knows she has 

been subject to disparate pay, it's frequently very 

difficult for her to have a good faith belief that 

that pay is intentionally discriminatory without more 

information.

 So for example, if you look at that chart 

on page 174 of the joint appendix, which summarizes 

the pay decisions for one of the years at issue here, 

if petitioner knew only the pay raise that she got 

that year, she would know that she got a 5.28 percent 

raise which is not - which is not suspicious. If she

knew what Mr. Conte had gotten, she would know that 

in fact that pay raise decision decreased the 

disparity between her pay and Mr. Conte's pay. If 

she knew what also happened with respect to Mr. Bice 

she would see he got a higher absolute raise than he 

did, but she got a bigger one than Todd. It's only 

if petitioner had all of the information in this 

chart, that she would know that that pay raise 

decision increased the overall disparity between her 

wages and the average wages of men doing the same 

job. And even then the amount of that disparity, 

standing alone wouldn't provide a sufficient reason 

to go claim intentional discrimination to the EEOC.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How does, how does time 

solve that difficulty?

 MR. RUSSELL: It's only after -- one would 

expect in a merit system that there would be some 

level of variation in the area and that would work 

out over time. It's only when it doesn't, when the 

disparity persists, when the different treatment 

accrues again and again and the overall disparity in 

the wages increases, that the employee has some 

reasonable basis to think that it's not natural 

variation in the pay decisions but actually 

intentional discrimination.

In the paycheck accrual rule that's been 

applied by the lower courts for more than 20 years 

without incident, adequately balances the interest of 

employees and being able to come forward once they 

find out that there is a reason to suspect 

discrimination, with an employer's reasonable 

interest in avoiding having to defend stale claims.

 I think it's important to note that the 

Equal Pay Act, which everybody agrees has a paycheck 

accrual rule, imposes all of the same burdens on 

employers that respondents allege would have led 

Congress to never impose a paycheck accrual under 

Title VII.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What happened to the 

Equal Pay Act claim? You started out with a Title 

VII claim and an equal pay claim and somewhere along 

the way the equal pay claim dropped out.

 MR. RUSSELL: It did. The magistrate 

judge initially recommended dismissing both the Title 

VII and equal pay claims on the grounds that there 

was a nondiscriminatory reason for the disparity. 

The District Courts held that there were fact 

disputes that precluded that conclusion, but for some 

reason only reinstated the Title VII claim.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't you ask for

the equal pay claim? As I understand the magistrate 

judge he said, yes, you had made it across the first 

hurdle, you had a prima facie case. You showed that 

you're a woman, and you're getting this and all the 

men are getting much higher. But the employer has 

come forward with any other factor other than sex and 

the other factor is that, your inadequate 

performance.

 MR. RUSSELL: We should have objected to 

the failure to reinstate the Equal Pay Act claim. We 

didn't; we didn't think it was that important and the 

time because we still had the Title VII claim.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because in the Title 

VII case assuming you're right, that you get across 

the same threshold, you're faced with the same 

defense. Right?

 MR. RUSSELL: Yes. It's essentially the 

same case kind of case in each instance. Although 

the jury has to find intentional discrimination in 

the Title VII case; under the Equal Pay Act the jury 

has to determine whether the employer has shown that 

the present disparity is the result of some factor 

other than sex. And so in both cases, the jury 

always has to consider the basis of prior decisions 

that are the cause of the present disparity.

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you have to show that 

at the time when a particular paycheck in question is 

issued, there was an intent to discriminate?

 MR. RUSSELL: No. The execution of a 

prior discriminatory decision constitutes a present 

violation of Title VII. It's frequently --

JUSTICE ALITO: What if the situation is 

that when the particular paycheck is cut, the 

company, the employer, whoever it is, has no intent 

whatsoever to discriminate? They think that they are 

issuing this pay on a totally nondiscriminatory 

basis?

 MR. RUSSELL: It still constitutes a 

violation because they are executing a present 

disparity that is because of sex within the meaning 

of the statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if 15 years 

earlier a discriminatory decision was made to give a 

pay raise of 4 percent rather than 5 percent, and 

that over the 15 years became the basis with other 

raises, you think you can challenge the 

discrimination 15 years later and say well, this was 

discriminatory because 15 years ago I didn't get a 

raise and that, carried forward, had a ripple effect 

into the current 180-day period.

MR. RUSSELL: Yes. That kind of claim 

would be timely under Section 706. The employer 

would have an awfully good laches defense.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would that be true if 

there were a change in ownership of the company, so 

the discrimination originally occurred under owner A, 

then the company is purchased by owner B, completely 

unrelated, and the, the disparity is used for 

bonuses, etcetera?

 MR. RUSSELL: That would depend on the 

general rules for attributing a liability from a 

successful --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under the, under 

the answer that you gave to the Chief Justice and the 

rule you propose, what of the case of differing 

ownership?

 MR. RUSSELL: I would think that they are 

still responsible in the same way that they are 

responsible for other actions that the prior company 

took.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that, but that would 

not be the result if the reason for the disparity 

between 4 percent and 5 percent was not a, a denial 

of a pay increase to a higher pay level, but rather 

denial of a promotion to another job.

MR. RICHARDS: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If that were the case, 

then it washes out and you have to challenge it right 

away.

 MR. RUSSELL: That is correct. And we 

think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Does that make any sense?

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, I think that it does 

for the reason that I said before, that that kind of 

consequence is a secondary effect of the prior 

unlawful employment practice, but under Evans, which 

that kind of problem goes to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you could call it a 

secondary effect but the only reason you want to get 

promoted to another job is to get more money. I 

think it's a primary effect.

 MR. RUSSELL: Well even if the Court 

didn't think that this is a completely satisfactory 

analytical line to draw, as I said before there are 

good practical reasons for drawing it, and every 

reason to think that Congress did draw it, because 

Congress enacted this statute against the background 

legal principle that pay, that the pay aspects of the 

employment relationship arise out of recurring 

transactions and give rise to recurring causes of

action. And that's the rule that everybody 

acknowledges Congress adopted under the Equal Pay 

Act. And to hold that there is a different rule 

under Title VII would for example lead to the 

anomalous proposition that Congress intended to 

permit women, a white woman in 1967 to challenge the 

present disparity in her pay, but not a black man 

under Title VII because the discrimination there was 

racial. We don't think that Congress intended the 

two acts to perform in such dramatically different 

ways. In fact --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Congress 

could have specifically provided for the Equal Pay 

Act rule under Title VII, but it didn't do that.

 MR. RUSSELL: No, it didn't have the same 

elements, but there's no reason to think that the 

difference in the elements --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It didn't have the same 

defenses because the Bennett amendment makes the 

defenses under the Equal Pay Act applicable under 

Title VII, right?

 MR. RUSSELL: That's right. And as a 

result the claims and the process of adjudicating 

both kinds of claims are not significantly different.

the 15 year old action which led to disparity that 

continues up to today, and suppose at the beginning 

or in July of 2006 the woman discovers it and brings 

her claim and suppose she wins. Now, is it the case 

-- and here I'm uncertain. I thought there was some 

rule in respect to getting damages that you could 

only go back 2 years?

 MR. RUSSELL: There is a provision of 

Title VII that limits back pay to at most 2 years.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And in that case would it 

mean that in this case where it happened 15 years ago 

and she won, but she didn't bring her act until 

August of 2006, that she could only then collect the 

extra money for the preceding 2 years?

 MR. RUSSELL: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So it isn't going to open 

up tremendous liability for 15 or 20 years ago.

 MR. RUSSELL: That's absolutely right, and 

in fact there's no reason to think that such claims 

are particularly common. This has been the rule in 

effect for 20 years in the lower courts and 

respondent is unable to show any actual evidence that 

these kinds of claims are common. But much more 

common are instances in which an employee has no 

reasonable basis for filing a charge of

discrimination within 180 days of the disparity.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose all 

they'd have to do is allege that sometime over the 

past -- I mean, it doesn't have to be 15 years. It 

could be 40 years, right -- that there was a 

discriminatory act, in one of the semi-annual pay 

reviews I was denied this, a raise that I should have 

gotten. It may have been 20 years ago. It may have 

been 40 years ago.

 MR. RUSSELL: They can certainly make that 

allegation, but the employer is left open to avail 

itself of the equitable defenses and they'll have a 

very easy time of showing that there's been undue 

delay.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does it say --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that if 

they just discovered it? I just learned about what 

happened 30 years ago at this company and it's -- I 

filed right away. There's no laches.

 MR. RUSSELL: In that case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then they have 

to go back and litigate what happened 30 years ago.

 MR. RUSSELL: I do acknowledge that a 

traditional laches defense would be more difficult 

than those --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your answer 

before was that this is not -- if she's going to 

bring a case I got a 2 percent raise, he got a 3 

percent raise, her chances are very slim, but if this 

builds up year by year to the point where see is 

saying, I'm being denied equal pay, it's a 

requirement of the anti-discrimination law that I get 

equal pay, so today I'm not getting equal pay, I 

thought -- I mean, the chance that she could win when 

she gets a salary review and she gets a little less 

than the other person are nil.

 MR. RUSSELL: Yes, and it's only after 

that same kind of decision has been repeated over a 

number of years that you actually have a case that 

you can bring to the EEOC. But under respondent's 

view by that time it's too late.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not your 

theory. I mean, if it happened once 20 years ago you 

have a case that you can bring, isn't it?

 MR. RUSSELL: That's true, but the 

practical --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You've got a memo 

that says we're going to pay, 20 years ago, we're 

going to pay males this much and we're going to pay 

females this much, and she says that obviously

affected my pay over the ensuing 15, 20 years.

 MR. RUSSELL: That's true, but the 

paycheck accrual rule also serves the function of the 

much more common case in which somebody doesn't 

derive notice of the potential discrimination until 

the discrimination has been repeated over time.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But isn't your position 

that an employer violates Title VII unless the 

employer periodically reviews the entire pay record 

of every employee to make sure that there has never 

been an uncomplained of act of discrimination at any 

point in the past that would have a continuing 

present effect on the amount of money that the 

employee is paid?

 MR. RUSSELL: No. They certainly have an 

incentive to do that under both the Equal Pay Act, 

which everybody acknowledges puts the employer 

subject to liability for any present disparity based 

on any prior decision that can't be justified as 

based on some factor other than sex, and that 

incentive has been around for a very long time and 

respondents aren't able to show that that's been an 

unmanageable burden. But employers as a matter of 

basic agency law know from the very beginning whether 

or not they've been paying the plaintiff less because

of her sex.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: How do they know that? 

10 years ago the employee got a particular, got a 

particular job evaluation and that dictated the 

amount of pay that that employee was going to get for 

that period and all, all subsequent pay built on that 

base, and then it turns out many years later that 

there was discrimination in the way the employee was 

evaluated way back when, even though there was no 

complaint about it; then under your theory that would 

be a present Title VII violation, to cut a paycheck 

that built, that was based on pay that was built on 

this act of discrimination that occurred long ago?

 MR. RUSSELL: Because this Court made 

clear as recently Faragher that when an employer 

delegates pay-setting authority to a supervisor the 

discrimination undertaken by that supervisor is 

imputed to the employer as a matter of agency law 

principles.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, yeah, but that 

assumed a present discrimination, and it seems to me 

the problem that we've got is the problem of 

connecting a past discrimination with what may in 

fact be an apparently neutral act 15 or 20 years 

later.

MR. RUSSELL: Well, I don't think that the 

proof that the act is discriminatory is any more 

difficult or any more difficult in concept when it 

happened several years ago than when it happened 180 

days ago. It's still the employer -- the employee 

still has to show that the present disparity is 

because of sex. And the fact that it may be more 

difficult as a practical matter is something that the 

court can take into account under a laches defense.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does he have to know 

that the present decision to continue the pay 

structure is discriminatory?

 MR. RUSSELL: No. It's enough that the 

employer knows as a matter of basic agency law that 

the petitioner is being paid less because of her sex, 

because of prior discriminatory decisions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- as I remember 

the facts of this case, wasn't it in 1995 that she 

got a substantial raise and the reason, according to 

her supervisor, was that he noticed that her pay was 

below the minimum of the appropriate range for her 

job?

 MR. RUSSELL: That's true. She did get a 

higher raise that year and that was his testimony. 

He also testified that he had told her differently,

that she had done a very good job that year and 

that's why she had gotten it, and the jury was 

entitled to believe that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I didn't understand one 

of your answers. Supposing that today the management 

does not know of the prior discrimination. Just, 

records that have been lost, it happened a long time 

ago. But there was evidence that there was a firm 

policy that women get 20 percent less than men 

forever and it's still -- that policy has continued 

up to date, but that these people making the decision 

today did not know that. Would there be liability or 

not?

 MR. RUSSELL: There would.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I thought you said the 

other. That's why I was --

MR. RUSSELL: I apologize if I was unclear 

about that. There would be liability, and basic 

agency law principles impute to the employer those 

prior decisions. So it's not possible for Goodyear 

as a matter of law to claim that it did not know 

about those decisions when they occurred, and I'm not 

aware of any principle of agency law --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the question is 

whether or not there was a discriminatory act and if

the employer, let's say it's an employer that has 

just purchased a business, thinks that it's a neutral 

criterion to base wages or bonuses or increase on a 

prior pay scale and he doesn't know about the prior 

discrimination, why isn't that a defense?

 MR. RUSSELL: It may be a defense. I'm 

not quite certain how agency law principles apply in 

that circumstance when there's been a change of 

ownership. But certainly when there hasn't been it's 

not unfair to the employer to say that so long as you 

base present pay on long past decisions it's your 

responsibility to make sure that that present pay is 

not discriminatory.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it's not 

enough presumably for somebody to come in and even up 

everybody? I mean, if you see that the women are 

making 20 percent less than the men you don't escape 

liability by paying everybody the same going forward, 

because perhaps if nondiscriminatory decisions had 

been made the women would have making 20 percent more 

than the men. You have to go back and revisit every 

pay decision or you're exposed to liability for 

current pay.

 MR. RUSSELL: That's true, that they have 

an incentive to do so. They also have that incentive

concededly under the Equal Pay Act and nothing in 

this Court's decision in this case is going to remove 

that incentive or that burden. And the fact that 

Congress didn't find that burden inappropriate under 

the Equal Pay Act is good reason to think that 

Congress wouldn't have thought it was inappropriate 

here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, what is your burden 

to prove? You've talked about their burden to go 

back when -- do I understand it that your view is 

that the only thing you have to prove is that in this 

case a woman was being paid at a rate which is 

different from the rate of a man doing a comparable 

job?

 MR. RUSSELL: No, that's not our position. 

We have to prove in addition that that disparity is 

because of sex, which necessarily --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you too then have to 

go, unless you can find a present policy to 

discriminate on sex, you too in your proof have to go 

back whatever it may be, you know, the 15 or 20 

years?

 MR. RUSSELL: Yes, and the longer that an 

employee waits the longer it is for her to sustain 

her burden of proof on that score. And in fact --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that true? 

I mean, it depends.  I suppose it may be harder for 

the company to mount a defense over time, so it may 

be to her advantage to wait.

 MR. RUSSELL: But if the employer can show 

in fact that there is a disadvantage, that there is 

prejudice, it can ask the court to limit the scope of 

the claim or eliminate it entirely under an equitable 

defense such as laches.

 I think it's important to keep in mind 

that this is not the first time that this Court has 

struggled with this question when does the unlawful 

employment practice occur in a disparate pay case. 

This Court confronted precisely that question in 

Bazemore and held that -- and rejected the Fourth 

Circuit's interpretation in that case that the 

present payment of a disparate wage was simply a 

consequence and not in itself a present violation of 

Title VII?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What do you say of the 

explanation that was given in Bazemore? I forget the 

subsequent case. It was in footnote 6. You know 

what I mean. Which referred to Bazemore as a case 

that involved a present discrimination which, which 

is inconsistent with your theory. What do you say

about footnote 6?

 MR. RUSSELL: I don't think it's 

inconsistent. There was present discrimination. 

There was, people were being paid less and it was 

because of their race. It just so happened that the 

because of their race was based on a decision that 

was made before the effective date of the act. I 

don't think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the policy -- I 

thought the assumption was that the policy was in 

fact a policy which, which was sort of currently 

honored and intended to be honored by the company, 

whereas the case that we're concerned about is the 

case in which there was a discriminatory act, you 

know, 5, 10, 15 years ago. Nobody remembers the 

discrimination now. It's just that it continues to 

have these ripple effect consequences. I would have 

thought that the subsequent explanation in Bazemore 

would have been inconsistent with your position with 

respect to the current ripple effect.

 MR. RUSSELL: No, I don't think that's an 

accurate description of what was going on in 

Bazemore. Recall, for example, that there were 

plaintiffs in Bazemore --

sorry, I can't think of the name of the case. You 

know the case that I'm talking about with the 

footnote?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Lorance?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I guess. Do you think 

that the Court in the footnote misstated Bazemore and 

that therefore we should trust to Bazemore and not 

the subsequent explanation?

 MR. RUSSELL: No. I thought -- I'd take 

the footnote in Lorance, if that's what you're 

referring to, to simply say that, like a facially 

discriminatory pay policy which discriminates every 

time it's implemented, a facially discriminatory 

seniority policy that discriminates every time it's 

implemented, the Court was -- considered in Bazemore 

a similar kind of recurring violation because, just 

like a facially discriminatory policy, a 

discriminatory pay structure or pay decision treats 

differently -- similarly situated people differently 

every time it's implemented.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that assumes that the 

company in effect says, we have a pay structure and 

our pay structure as it is now treats people 

differently depending on sex, race, or whatever. And 

that's not the kind -- that's something very

different from the ripple effect argument.

 MR. RUSSELL: I don't think that it is. 

For example, remember that in Bazemore there were 

plaintiffs, workers who were hired after the merger, 

after 1965, and when they were hired they were paid 

the same rate as the white employees, and the 

disparity in their wages in 1972 arose solely because 

of the discriminatory application of a merit-based 

pay raise decision, system, which is exactly the same 

kind of claim that we're making in this case. But 

this Court nonetheless held that continuing to pay 

workers, those workers, less than similarly situated 

whites because of that discrimination that occurred 

before the effective date of the act was still a 

present violation of Title VII.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this 

question. Supposing in the annual review before a 

promotion is concerned the officer making the 

recommendation was instructed not only to decide what 

increase would be appropriate but also to review past 

history and decide whether or not the employee was 

being paid fairly in a nondiscriminatory basis and 

that was part of the assignment. Would you have a 

case if that were the case?

 MR. RUSSELL: The plaintiff would be

required to show that that de novo decision was 

intentionally discriminatory.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You couldn't rely on the 

past history in that situation?

 MR. RUSSELL: That's right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because I think that's 

sort of what Justice -- Judge Jofla thought was going 

on here.

 MR. RUSSELL: I don't think that he -- he 

couldn't have thought that because the facts are 

absolutely clear and Goodyear acknowledges in this 

Court that the pay system that they had in place 

simply made an annual decision whether to make a 

marginal increase into the raise and took the prior 

salary as given.

 If I could, before I sit down, I'd like to 

make the point that to the extent the Court doesn't 

think Bazemore decides this case, and doesn't think 

that the statute is clear on this question, it should 

defer to the expert opinion of the EEOC on this 

question in which they have particular expertise 

because they see thousands of these claims every 

year. They know better than anybody else whether the 

paycheck accrual rule is unworkable in practice, or 

that the pay decision accrual rule will lead to the

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you counsel. 

Mr. Nager, we'll hear now from you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN D. NAGER

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. NAGER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 This Court has repeatedly said that a 

claim of intentional discrimination is timely and 

actionable only if it concerns intentionally 

discriminatory acts taken during Title VII's charge 

filing period.

 And the question presented in this case 

asks the Court to hold that a disparity in pay states 

a timely actionable claim for intentional 

discrimination if it is merely the result of 

allegedly discriminatory actions taken outside of the 

charge filing period. The question presented is 

inconsistent with holding after holding of this 

Court. When Goodyear issued paychecks during the 

charge filing period, it did not commit intentionally 

discriminatory acts. No one at Goodyear took 

Miss Ledbetter's sex into account during the charge

filing period in deciding what to pay her.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Nager, can I test 

your theory with a hypothetical question? Supposing 

20 years ago, there was an actual written policy 

statement, we pay women 20 percent less than men. 

And that was written up and everybody knew it. And 

then nothing changed for the next 20 years, and the 

person then sued today. Would she be -- and there 

was no intent to do anything, this is just the way 

it's always been. Would she have a cause of action?

 MR. NAGER: The answer to that, I think, 

is no, if I understand your hypothetical, if the 

employer was not intending to classify on the basis 

of gender.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: If present intent was 

merely to do what we have always done, you have to go 

back 20 years to find out that what we have always 

done is the result of a policy decision made 20 years 

ago that we can hire women at a less expense than men 

so we will continue to pay the same rate. Would the 

per paycheck rule apply to that case?

 MR. NAGER: I think the answer is it 

clearly would be untimely insofar as the allegation 

is that there is discrimination today merely because 

there was discrimination yesterday. Whether or not

there is discrimination going on during the charge 

filing period, whether or not women are intentionally 

being treated differently than men, I think the 

answer, based upon your hypothetical, is no, given 

what you've said.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If the employer had a 

policy of paying women, all women, 20 percent less 

than men, and it continued that policy, surely it 

would know in the present day when it issued those 

paychecks that it was paying women less than men. So 

it would be intentionally discriminating at this 

time, wouldn't it?

 MR. NAGER: Justice Alito, that's why I 

qualified my answer to Justice Stevens, because I 

think that the question his hypothetical raises, like 

your question, goes to the sufficiency of evidence 

necessary to prove intent during the charge filing 

period. And I don't want in any way to be heard that 

there is anything in our position in this case that 

tries to answer that question.

 The reason I'm not trying to answer that 

question in this case is because that question is not 

before the Court except with one small respect. If 

the only thing that the plaintiff is relying upon is 

discrimination outside of the charge filing period,

that is legally insufficient under this Court's cases 

in Evans, Ricks, Lorance and Machinists before it.

 What Bazemore dealt with was a case very 

much like your hypothetical, Justice Alito, of an 

allegation of an ongoing racial classification during 

the actionable time period. And it was because of 

that allegation of ongoing actionable racial 

classification and pay that there was both a timely 

claim, and according to Justice Brennan's opinion for 

all nine members of the Court of that -- in that 

case, a very serious potential error by the district 

court in that case as to whether or not it had been 

clearly erroneous in holding that the United States 

had failed its proof of proving an ongoing 

intentional race discrimination case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Nager, why did it 

make any sense to treat this area any different from 

the Equal Pay Act.

 MR. NAGER: Because they are two different 

statutes and the elements of the plaintiff's claims 

are fundamentally different. That's the fundamental 

flaw in the petitioner's claim in this case. Let me 

explain, if I may, Justice Scalia.

 In a Title VII case, in an intentional 

discrimination case, the question is whether or not

there is an act that is motivated by gender during 

the charge filing period. That is not an element of 

the plaintiff's cause of action in an Equal Pay Act 

case.

 In an Equal Pay Act case, all the 

plaintiff has to do is allege they are performing 

equal work to a male, and that they are paid 

differently. And it's that cause of action that 

triggers the statute of limitations in an Equal Pay 

Act case. That's fundamentally different. As Chief 

Justice Roberts said --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it different if 

the one further statement was made. And the employer 

knew that every woman is being paid less than every 

man. Why isn't that sufficient under Title VII, and 

if you want evidence, your own supervisor said, oh, 

we saw one year that she was outside the range 

appropriate for this job.

 MR. NAGER: Well, knowledge is a necessary 

condition, but it's not a sufficient condition, 

Justice Ginsburg. In Evans, the employer knew it 

previously had a sexual -- a gender-based 

discriminatory policy about whether or not female 

flight attendants could work after they got married. 

But that prior knowledge of prior discrimination by

the employer wasn't sufficient to make the neutral 

action taken --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Evans involved a factor 

that simply is not present here. I mean, Evans 

involved a seniority system. And if this person who 

had been off the job were to come back two years 

later, and bump people who had been there every day, 

well, certainly that's a different case than this 

one, where she is saying, I should have been paid 

equally. I wasn't. And I know I can go back only 

two years. That's quite a bit different than the 

Evans situation.

 MR. NAGER: Justice Ginsburg, Title VII 

allows proof of dissimilar treatment as evidence of 

present intentional discrimination, but it's not the 

elements of the claim. As Chief Justice Roberts was 

pointing out, Title VII would prohibit paying a woman 

the same amount as a male if the employer would have 

paid the female more because she had a -- more 

degrees or other criteria that the employer 

ordinarily took into account.

 The elements of those two claims are 

fundamentally different. What makes this case 

untimely and unactionable is that there is no claim 

and there can be no claim because it's the law of the

case that Goodyear took Miss Ledbetter's sex into 

account during the charge filing period.

 What Goodyear did was the same kind of 

neutral rule as in Evans. What Goodyear did was it 

said, we are looking at the pay rate contained in our 

payroll system, and applying those rates as they are 

mandated for all of our employees, male or female. 

And what Goodyear did at the beginning of each 

evaluation period was say, we are starting this 

payroll period with the pay rates that were paid in 

the last period for all of our employees, male or 

female, no matter what their prior causes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If only the 180 day 

period counts, and she can complain only about 

discrimination in that period, then how do you 

account for her being able to go back not 180 days, 

but two years for her remedy?

 MR. NAGER: The two-year rule is only a 

damages rule that applies only in Title VII cases. 

And it's triggered in cases such as where there has 

been equitable tolling or equitable estoppel, because 

the employer -- it was a promotion case or a pay case

Title VII cases. You can't go back more than two 

years for damages. But it would seem that doesn't 

fit at all whether you can go back only 180 days.

 MR. NAGER: No. What the 180 days is for 

is determining the time period during which the 

allegedly illegal act must occur. That period can be 

tolled using a tolling rule. It can tolled for three 

years possibly. The back pay rule says, even if you 

tolled the statute of limitations for more than the 

two-year back pay period, you can only get back pay 

for two years. What is going on, of course, in this 

case, is they are trying to use allegedly 

discriminatory acts that occurred 10, 15, 20 years 

ago, both to make neutral acts actionable, and to get 

compensatory and punitive damages.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is she claiming 

that in 1995, a supervisor recognized that my pay was 

way out of line. Isn't that what the supervisor 

testified?

 MR. NAGER: He did. And he said he raised 

her pay up the maximum amount he was entitled to that 

year. And she didn't file a charge of discrimination 

in 1995.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe she thought that, 

well, they are on the right track. Next year, they

are going to raise me up to the equal pay level.

 MR. NAGER: And what the purpose of the 

charge filing requirement under Title VII, as this 

Court has repeatedly said, is to require that 

employee to come forward promptly within 180 days of 

the date that the alleged unlawful employment action 

is communicated to her, and bring that claim or lose 

it, that the purpose of Section 706 was to create 

repose.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The question that I 

asked Mr. Nager that I think is really important, and 

that is, where do you put these pay cases? Do you 

put it in the box with the hostile environment that 

builds up over time, and as long as the environment 

is hostile at the time you bring your complaint, then 

it doesn't matter that it started 20 years ago. This 

notion of one year, it's 2 percent, and the other 

person got 3 percent, you really don't have an 

effective claim unless it builds up to the point 

where there is a noticeable disparity.

 MR. NAGER: Justice Ginsburg, the 

petitioner in this case has agreed with us that this 

is the kind of discrete employment action that 

triggers the 180-day period. It is not like a sexual 

harassment claim.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is that 

agreement?

 MR. NAGER: It's in their brief. They 

repeatedly quote the portion of Morgan which 

described pay claims as discrete acts subject to the 

discrete trigger rule in the Morgan opinion. And 

that, of course, is an obvious concession that they 

had to make in this case, because Mr. Russell would 

not concede when Justice Scalia asked that that first 

pay rate decision was not an identifiable act, that 

it wasn't an actionable -- immediately actionable 

claim.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the 

Morgan decision quotes Bazemore for saying, under 

Title VII, each week's paycheck that delivered less 

to a black than to a similarly situated white is a 

wrong, actionable under Title VII.

 MR. NAGER: And that's in the portion of 

the opinion that's dealing with discrete employment 

action. It's not in the portion of the opinion 

dealing with sexual harassment claims. I'm trying to 

answer your question about which portion of Morgan 

pay claims fall into.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Whatever portion it's 

in, it says each week's paycheck that delivered less

to a black than to a similarly situated white is a 

wrong, actionable --

MR. NAGER: Because Justice Thomas' 

opinion was accurately describing the holding in 

Bazemore on the facts of Bazemore, because in 

Bazemore there was a claim, in contrast to this case, 

of ongoing intentional race discrimination in 

classifying employees on the basis of their race and 

paying the black employees less than the whites. If 

the Court would look at the remand order in the 

Bazemore case, they'll see that the Court did not 

remand with instructions that judgment be entered for 

the United States merely because there was a 

disparity in salaries.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Justice Brennan's opinion 

sounds to me, part one, as if he is saying what the 

mistake was that the company made here is that they 

didn't really eradicate the effects of the past bad 

act, and they were trying to eradicate it.

 MR. NAGER: Well, actually, the United 

States' allegations in the case were trying --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's another part of 

the case that's part two and part three about the 

evidence that came in. In fact, there are about six 

other parts. I'm just talking about part one.

MR. NAGER: That's part one.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. All right. So I 

read that. Now, this is my this is my cost/benefit 

analysis here. If we follow the other side's rule, 

it's very simple, we just said Bazemore applies, 

whether there's a practice or whether it was a 

discrete thing, or whatever, so it's simple. But we 

do have to distinguish pay from the other kinds of 

things. And we have heard them explain why there is 

a distinction. I'd rather get to your side and then 

you can attack both, or whatever.

 Your side of it, it seems to me, if I 

agree to you, I now have to create in the law some 

kind of thing that sounds very complicated about 

whether that old bad thing was somehow a pattern or a 

practice that, as a pattern or a practice, didn't get 

eradicated within the last few years, or was a 

totally discrete act, and therefore, had no 

implication as a pattern or practice that didn't get 

eradicated. That sounds hard.

 And the second thing I guess I'd have to 

do is to create a lot of tolling law because there 

will be probably a significant number of 

circumstances where a woman is being paid less, and 

all she does is for the last six months get her

paychecks and she doesn't really know it because pay 

is a complicated thing, and through no fault of her 

own, it takes about eight or nine months or even a 

year for her to find out. And we are going to have 

to toll, aren't we?

 So I have, legally speaking, a complicated 

tolling system that I have to graft on to this, your 

case. I also have to start distinguishing Bazemore 

which is pretty hard to do. But on the other side, 

they are just saying, go with the flow. Nobody is 

really hurt, because the employer has to worry about 

all this stuff anyway under the Equal Pay Act. I'm 

giving you that summary so you can just shoot it 

down.

 MR. NAGER: Well, it was a compound 

question, but I'll try to answer each of its parts.

 The first point I would make is that 

Bazemore came after Evans and Hazelwood and Ricks, 

and it did not distinguish Evans or Hazelwood or 

Ricks on the grounds that Bazemore is a pay case and 

Hazelwood and Evans were not pay cases. It 

distinguished them on the grounds of whether or not 

the alleged discrimination was taking place in the 

charge filing period. So this notion that Bazemore 

stands as a proposition that Evans and Lorance and

that line of cases doesn't apply because they don't 

apply to pay cases was not the opinion of the Court 

in Bazemore.

 Secondly, we are not asking you, and I 

don't think it takes any difficulty to apply the rule 

that we are proposing in this case. We are proposing 

the same rule that's set forth in Justice Stevens' 

opinion for the Court in Evans, the same rule that's 

set forth in Justice Powell's opinion in Ricks, the 

same rule that's set forward in Justice Scalia's 

opinion for the Court in Lorance.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But there is a slight 

difference in that you're focused on whether 

discrimination occurred within the 180-day period. 

And if I understand you correctly, discrimination 

would have occurred during the 180-day period if the 

employer knew of the policy that I described, because 

then he would be knowingly paying less.

 MR. NAGER: No. Not if he had knowledge 

of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I thought your answer to 

Justice Alito made that point.

 MR. NAGER: Well, what I said to Justice 

Alito was, if the employer knew that it previously 

had a policy and if it knew and intended that its

present pay would be done for gender-related reasons 

or racially-related reasons, it would constitute --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the question of 

whether just knowing that that's a source of the 

policy would be a gender-related reason.

 MR. NAGER: Well, the question is whether 

there was a present policy. That's the point the 

Solicitor General makes in its brief and the point we 

make in our brief.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, in my hypothetical 

there was a policy established 20 years ago, a 20 

percent differential, never been changed. And the 

only question that would differ, in some cases the 

employer knows about it and in some others he 

doesn't.

 MR. NAGER: And if the employer is 

presently applying, and knowingly and intentionally 

doing so, a 20 percent differential for male and 

female employees for no reason other than the gender 

of the employees, that's a present violation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, what his reason 

is, this is always the way we did it. That's his 

reason.

 MR. NAGER: Well, if what he's saying is, 

the way we have always done it is engage in gender

discrimination, then doing it in the present time 

period would state a present claim.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose he has no 

intent to discriminate as a present matter, but he 

also knows that his decision is necessarily based on 

a policy that was discriminatory some years ago. 

What result?

 MR. NAGER: I think if I understood the 

question, Justice Kennedy, I think no present claim, 

because the only thing you said that he knew is that 

they previously engaged in discriminatory actions.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: He knows it, but his 

present decision is necessarily based on some prior 

decision that was discriminatory.

 MR. NAGER: That in and of itself is not 

sufficient. That's the point that, the seniority 

system in Lorance was necessarily based upon an 

earlier decision that the employer --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: How is that -- how is 

that consistent with the statement in Bazemore that 

the employer has a duty to eradicate past 

discrimination?

 MR. NAGER: Well, the duty was to 

eradicate the alleged ongoing facially discriminatory 

pay practices that preceded the enactment of Title

VII and were alleged to have been maintained for 

racially purposeful reasons after Title VII became 

effective to a public employer. There is no 

contemplation in that case that that duty would 

require an employer to investigate discrete 

employment decisions made in years gone by that 

weren't made the subject of a timely charge. What 

this Court has said repeatedly is when the charge 

filing period passes and no charge is brought, the 

employer is entitled to treat that past act as if it 

was a lawful act. That's what Justice Thomas' 

opinion in Morgan says. That's what, the opinion 

that Justice Stevens wrote for the Court in Evans.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that so even if they 

know it was in fact originally an unlawful act?

 MR. NAGER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You draw a line between 

present purposeful discrimination and present 

knowledge of past discrimination which is knowingly 

carried forward.

 MR. NAGER: That's correct. Because the 

purpose of Section 706(e) is to give repose for those 

past decisions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you describe 

dealing with a case like Manhart where they were

complaining about a pension plan that had been 

instituted, oh, way longer than 180 days, years and 

years before?

 MR. NAGER: That plan was facially 

discriminatory. It included on the face of the plan 

gender-based mortality tables. And as Justice 

Scalia's opinion for the Court in Lorance and the 

footnote that Justice Souter pointed out to, a 

facially discriminatory policy necessarily evidences 

present intent each time it is applied, and that is 

the important distinction. On the one hand you have 

cases that are both timely and as a matter of law 

show present intent because they are facially 

discriminatory. On the other end of the continuum 

you have cases that are only about past 

discrimination and do not involve any present 

actionable claim of intentional discrimination, and 

they are both untimely and legally insufficient. And 

then you have the cases in the middle which concern 

present allegations of discriminatory practices so 

obnoxious, as alleged in Bazemore, that the Court 

held that district court may have been clearly 

erroneous in its conclusion that there was no present 

intentional discrimination.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. NAGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Title VII gives employees like petitioner 

180 days to challenge an individual pay decision such 

as a denial of a pay raise. Employees who allow the 

180-day period to pass may not years later and even 

at the end of their careers challenge their current 

paychecks on the grounds that they are the result of 

a number of discrete individually discriminatory pay 

decisions that occurred long ago.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This would be a good 

Equal Pay Act case, wouldn't it?

 MR. NAGER: If it met the requirements of 

the Equal Pay Act, which is that it has to be the 

same knowledge, skills and responsibilities and 

effort for the job, then every time that you have a 

failure to deliver equal pay for equal work there is 

a violation of the act. But Title VII is not an 

equal pay for equal work statute, it is a 

nondiscrimination statute, and so that you have to 

show intentional discrimination in pay, not just the 

absence of equal pay.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why doesn't it become 

intentional, at least after 1995, when the supervisor 

recognizes that he's got an employee that is out of 

the appropriate range for her job, whether she does 

it badly or well?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, if an 

employee brought a claim within 180 days of the 

decision made then, that is to not, to not equalize 

the pay further --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would she bring it 

then? They gave her a big raise that year.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, because I think what 

you're suggesting is they didn't give her a big 

enough raise, because there was still intentional 

discrimination from prior years that were not, that 

were unchallenged.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Didn't she have every 

reason to expect, well, they finally noticed it, so 

next year I'm going to get that same size raise, but 

that it doesn't happen the next year?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: And if it doesn't happen 

that next year, then that employee has 180 days to 

challenge that pay decision on the ground that it's 

intentionally discriminatory. If she does not do 

that, she cannot come back 15 years later and say

that a decision that was made 15 years ago and 14 

years ago were based on my gender, and they --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: She is not talking 

about a decision made 15 or 14 in this case. She 

starts out even, and it builds up over time.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, I think in some, in 

some cases that, pay cases, it will build up over 

time. In some cases it will happen immediately. But 

in either case, what Title VII says is that you have 

180 days to challenge a discrete pay decision. If 

you do not do that, you cannot come back later, years 

later, four years later, six years later, or here at 

the end of her career, and challenge every pay 

decision that's been made up until then on the 

grounds that intent, it was intentionally 

discriminatory and continues to have ongoing effects.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you could if the 

person making the decision was aware of the 

discriminatory policy.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: Knowledge of prior 

unlawful acts is relevant evidence in deciding 

whether it's present day intentional discrimination. 

But just as in a case where there's a promotion and 

I'm aware that there was a prior discrimination in a 

promotion and that was not timely challenged, and the

person comes to me today and says I want my promotion 

now. If I'm aware that she was denied that promotion 

for discriminatory reason but she did not timely 

challenge it, my decision not to give her that 

promotion is not automatically discriminatory.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But you're changing the 

hypothetical. My hypothetical was simply a pay case.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: I understand that, and I'm 

saying the same rule applies in a pay case that 

applies in a promotion case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You're saying, I think 

contrary to your colleague if I remember correctly, 

that even if the employer knew of the 20 percent 

differential policy established 20 years ago, it 

could still carry it into effect today.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: What I'm saying with 

respect to a policy is if you have an ongoing policy 

that is still being applied in the limitations 

period, and that your current policy is to pay less 

to women than to men, then of course you can sue.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's say it's the 

same person who made the decision. You know, five 

years ago he said I'm giving a 6 percent raise to 

men, I'm giving a 3 percent raise to women, and then 

he decides that's illegal, and so from now on

everybody is going to get a 4 percent raise every 

year if you meet certain standards. Is that ongoing 

discrimination or is that a neutral thing, that he 

doesn't have to take into account the past 

discrimination?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: That's a neutral discrete 

act that was made at the time. It was not 

challenged.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though he 

knows that it carries forward the illegal 

discrimination?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: Even when the employer --

you can have an inference from knowledge of past 

illegal conduct that your present intent is to carry 

forward that differential based on the person's sex, 

but it is not an automatic inference. You can also, 

the employer could say look, that was a decision that 

occurred a while ago. A lot of people did this. 

There were decisions made that affected a lot of 

other people --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're talking 

about --

MR. GORNSTEIN: -- and I didn't correct 

those either, and that's a neutral policy.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's a defense.

And you're talking about, yes, you might draw that 

inference but that inference would be wrong because I 

have a defense. The defense is poor performance 

explains it, not sex discrimination.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: But under Title VII, poor 

performance isn't a defense. It is negating 

intentional discrimination. It's the employer's 

employee's burden --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought at least in 

this area, the defenses were the same as under the 

Equal Pay Act.

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, there are -- there is 

an additional layer of defense, but still the 

employee has to prove an additional element in a 

Title VII claim, not just the absence of equal pay 

for equal work, it has to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Gornstein, why should 

we listen to the Solicitor General rather than the 

EEOC? I mean, they have taken a different position 

from the one that you're urging upon us.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: The EEOC has taken a 

different position but that decision that the EEOC 

has taken has been based on its reading of this 

Court's decision in Bazemore, and this Court does not 

give deference to the EEOC under Skidmore or under

any other standard.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So why don't we at 

least hear from the EEOC? That has happened in other 

cases where the Department of Justice and the EEOC 

take different positions, at least the EEOC filed a 

brief even though it wasn't the Government's brief.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: That has occasionally 

happened in the past. It has not happened as a 

regular matter, or to my knowledge it does not 

ordinarily occur. The EEOC --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If the EEOC is upheld in 

the Court of Appeals and review is sought here, will 

the Government confess error?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: I'm sorry, Justice Souter?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If the EEOC decision is 

upheld by one of the Courts of Appeals and there is 

an attempt to bring the case here on cert, will the 

Government confess error?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: If the Court rules in the 

Government's favor in this case, then that case would 

have to be vacated and remanded for reconsideration 

in light of this Court's decision today. The EEOC's

it. If -- if there is a clear cut case in which the 

EEOC takes a position different from the one the 

Government is now espousing, and a Court of Appeals 

upholds it, and cert is sought here, will the 

Solicitor General say please remand, or simply 

confess judgment?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Souter, I would 

like to answer that question today but of course if 

the Court doesn't resolve the question today that's 

been decided today, but issues a new decision, 

anything we would have to do would have to look at 

that new decision and make a judgment about what the 

law is at that time. And so my -- my point is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I think I got your point.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Touche.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: To go on, there are three 

decisions of this Court that control the result here, 

Evans, Ricks and Lorance, each of which says that the 

employee cannot circumvent the limitations period by 

challenging conduct within the limitations period on 

the grounds that it is the result of a prior act of 

intentional discrimination that was not timely 

challenged.

 A second reason to reject petitioner's 

rule is that petitioner's rule, as petitioner admits,

creates a special rule for pay cases when there is 

nothing in the language of Title VII that would 

justify a special rule. Title VII has the same 

mandate of nondiscrimination for pay as for any other 

practice. It has the same 180-day period for pay 

claims as any other claim.

 And the third reason to reject 

petitioner's view is that it would undo the statute 

of limitations in pay cases, because the result would 

be, what you have here is that an employee could wait 

until the end of their career, or at least a very 

substantial number of years, and then challenge 

current pay on the basis of past acts that took place 

a long time ago. And Justice Breyer, you talked 

about it being limited to just back pay during the 

two-year period. The courts that have looked at this 

have not decided whether it's the 180-day period or 

the two-year period if you buy petitioner's theory, I 

don't think he has either. But the important 

additional point of order is you're still hinging 

liability on past acts long ago and you're adding the 

possibility of compensatory relief and punitive 

damages, so it's not the limited damage award that 

you're contemplating necessarily.

other side of this? It if you win on this, then 

don't you have to have a fairly relaxed standard of 

allowing the woman, tolling or something, when she 

just gets some paychecks that would take her a while 

to figure out that these are really reflecting some 

old discrimination and she doesn't know. It's 

different in that respect from the promotion itself.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well in some -- if she's 

denied a pay raise and she's aware that other people 

are getting substantial pay raises -- I don't think 

it's that much different than somebody else getting 

the promotion and me not getting that promotion.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, she knows this. 

She knows that, all these boxes on her paychecks and 

she's not quite sure what they mean. All right, your 

answer is not much different.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, to the extent that 

you want to address equitable tolling. That's the 

question, should there be equitable tolling until 

such time as she's aware of the disparity. But what 

petitioner's theory does is says even after the 

employee is aware of the disparity she can wait 15 

more years and then sue.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel.

Mr. Russell, you have 3 minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. RUSSELL: I think the fundamental 

disagreement in this case comes down to what is the 

unlawful employment practice Congress was referring 

to when it prohibited discrimination with respect to 

compensation. If it is under our view, in our view, 

the payment of an intentionally disparate wage, then 

there's no question that under Bazemore the violation 

occurred during the limitations period. The fact 

that the intent was formed outside the limitations 

period doesn't make the present payment of a 

disparate wage because of sex any less intentionally 

discriminatory. But the difference in the 

conceptions, which frankly isn't answered by the 

plain text of this statute itself, should be resolved 

in light of the practical consequences of the 

differences in the rules.

 The Solicitor General acknowledges that a 

paycheck accrual rule applies at least in a case of a 

policy of discrimination, but that's a very difficult 

rule to administer for the EEOC, which must make a 

determination of timeliness before it even has 

authority to investigate a claim. It shouldn't be

left to the EEOC to figure out whether there's an 

unwritten practice or an unwritten policy which would 

require an extensive investigation not only of the 

petitioner's pay but of everybody else's. You recall 

that in Bazemore they had to conduct a multiple 

regression analysis to establish a pattern of 

discrimination there.

 Our rule is simple to administer and has 

been administered for decades in the lower courts and 

it's the rule that the EEOC itself has chosen in 

construing this ambiguous aspect of the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you agree that their 

action is just based on Bazemore or their reading of 

Bazemore?

 MR. RUSSELL: No, that's incorrect. I 

mean, the EEOC has taken this position that you can 

challenge present pay disparities even before the 

Court's decision in Bazemore and it continued to 

adhere to it afterward. The fact that they cited to 

Bazemore shouldn't disentitle them to the kind of 

deference that they're ordinarily entitled to when 

they construe a statute that's given to them, and 

this is precisely the kind of question Congress would 

have entitled them to exercise their expertise on.

 Finally, I would like to raise the point

that under respondent's rule the Extension Service 

would have been permitted to pay blacks less than 

white in perpetuity in Bazemore so long as it did so 

because of cost and not because it wanted to continue 

to discriminate on the basis of race. And similarly, 

under the Solicitor General's view an employer who 

had intentionally discriminated through discrete 

decisions against some of its employees prior to the 

act would be allowed to continue to do so after the 

act because the decision would have been the 

potentially unlawful act in that case and that 

wouldn't have been actionable.

 We respectfully suggest that Congress 

intended nothing than a complete --

JUSTICE ALITO: How could cost justify a 

dual pay scale?

 MR. RUSSELL: It could -- the Extension 

Service --

JUSTICE ALITO: You'd have to have another 

factor in the decision, which was that you didn't 

want to change pay. But cost alone couldn't justify 

that.

 MR. RUSSELL: It would be a 

nondiscriminatory reason. They would -- they would 

say that, the reason we didn't immediately equalize

salaries is because it cost too much, it would have 

required -- we'd be required to cut down on our 

programs. And under respondent's view that is not 

intentionally pay-maintaining discrimination.

 JUSTICE ALITO: No, you'd have to say, we 

don't want to spend any more and we also don't want 

to equalize pay. You have to say the second too.

 MR. RUSSELL: They would say, we don't 

want to equalize pay because it costs too much, and 

that's not a discriminatory reason for maintaining 

the prior disparity. But ultimately --

JUSTICE ALITO: If you say you're not 

going to equalize pay, you're saying you're going to 

discriminate on the basis of race.

 MR. RUSSELL: Which is what happened here. 

Goodyear continued to discriminate on the basis of 

sex, knowing as a matter of agency law that it had 

done, it had set her pay for discriminatory reasons 

in the past.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can equalize 

pay by lowering others. You don't -- raising the 

discriminated-against class is not the only way to 

equalize pay. So I don't see how cost is a 

justification for continuing the disparity.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not under the Equal Pay

Act. You can only equalize up, not down.

 MR. RUSSELL: That's true.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under Title VII 

you can equalize either way, right?

 MR. RUSSELL: It would, but if they chose 

not to equalize at all because they don't want to 

spend the money the money that would be a 

nondiscriminatory reason.

 JUSTICE ALITO: You'd certainly have a 

very happy work force if you equalized one way.

 MR. RUSSELL: Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the
