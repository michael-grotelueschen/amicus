CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear 

argument first this morning in Case 09-6338, Dillon v. 

United States. 

Ms. Freeland. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA B. FREELAND 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. FREELAND: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

Believing its hands were tied by a policy 

statement created to prevent application of this Court's 

decision in Booker to section 3582(c) proceedings, the 

district court imposed a mandatory guideline sentence 

that exceeded the maximum authorized by the jury's 

verdict by more than six years. Sentencing Commission 

policy cannot override this Court's clear and 

unambiguous directive to courts to treat the guidelines 

as advisory in all cases moving forward, and any 

interpretation of section 3582(c) that permits the 

Commission to mandate sentences must be rejected, not 

only as a matter of statutory stare decisis, but because 

it would violate the Sixth Amendment. 

In an effort to avoid this result, the 

government elevates form over substance, arguing that

section 3582(c) proceedings are not sentencings at 

the -- and that the sentence imposed is not a new 

sentence. The government is wrong. 

Section 3582(c) proceedings are sentencings 

at which Booker's constitutional and remedial holdings 

must apply. The --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Freeland --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the 

Sentencing Commission just issued a new guideline and 

said anyone with a -- a crack sentence, their sentence 

is going to be reduced by 10 percent? That wouldn't 

present any problems, would it? 

MS. FREELAND: Mr. Chief Justice, I think it 

would present precisely the same problems here. By 

indicating an amount of time that a sentence could be 

reduced, the Sentencing Commission would be doing 

precisely what it did here, which is setting a lower 

level, mandatory lower level, on sentences --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's no --

MS. FREELAND: -- that the district court 

could impose. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But 3553(a) doesn't 

even come into play under my hypothetical. 

MS. FREELAND: I'm sorry, Your Honor.

come into play, so there's not a resentencing by a 

judge. It is just an across-the-board policy, like 

increasing good time credits. 

MS. FREELAND: I disagree, Your Honor, 

because Congress in this case decided to enact a 

statute, 3582(c), that invokes the discretionary 

sentencing power of the court. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, in -- in this 

case, but in my hypothetical Congress hasn't done that. 

It hasn't -- or the Sentencing Commission hasn't done 

that. They haven't invoked the discretionary 

sentencing. They just said: Across the board, 10 

percent off. 

MS. FREELAND: And, Your Honor, perhaps I 

misunderstood, but once the Sentencing Commission acts 

to revise a guideline under its power under 994(u) and 

opts to make that amendment retroactive under -- I mean, 

994(o) -- and opts to make it retroactive under 994(u), 

only the court has power to lower a sentence. Congress 

enacted --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why is that? It's 

the same hypothetical of the Chief Justice. I'm not 

interrupting your -- your discussion with him. Suppose, 

pursuant to a permissible regulation, the BOP says: Just 

file paperwork with us, and if -- and if you show that

you were under a crack cocaine sentence, you’re going

it. What --

MS. FREELAND: And, Justice Kennedy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there a problem with that? 

MS. FREELAND: Justice Kennedy, I think there 

would be. And, again, I don't mean to be dodging the question. 

The problem is section 3582(c). Congress clearly indicated 

that it wanted these types of reductions to be treated 

differently than those under 3624(b), which are 

delegated to the Bureau of Prisons. And those types of 

reductions --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but the -- the 

hypothetical is Congress doesn't do this. The 

hypothetical is that Congress just tells the BOP: Find 

out who's in on crack cocaine and release them --

whatever, 20 months early. 

MS. FREELAND: Your Honor --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What’s wrong with that? 

MS. FREELAND: Your Honor, if 

Congress chose to draft a statute similar to 3624(b) to 

empower the Bureau of Prisons to act whenever the 

Commission lowered a guideline or -- or changed a 

guideline under 994(o), I agree with Your Honor. It 

would not present the problems here.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. Then the Chief 

Justice's hypothetical, at least for me, meant: What --

why should there be a difference? 

MS. FREELAND: The difference, again -- and 

I don't mean to be dodging your questions. The 

difference is that Congress acted in two very different 

ways here. It enacted 3582(c) to deal with reductions 

in sentence that are -- that are prompted by revisions 

to the guidelines, and it enacted 3624(b) to deal with 

revisions that are prompted by good behavior. And 

it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is the 

constitutional difference that would inure a Sixth 

Amendment right in the resentencing by the court that 

doesn't when it's a resentencing or a modification of a 

sentence by the Bureau of Prisons? 

MS. FREELAND: Justice Sotomayor, I think 

the difference would be that when it is delegated to the 

courts under a statute like 3582(c), the court is then 

dealing with a mandatory guideline range, and the Sixth 

Amendment problem arises when the court sentences --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But is this truly a new 

sentence, meaning a person serving a sentence? This is 

an act of clemency. Whether the Bureau of Prisons does 

it or the court does it, why should we introduce a

different binding or non-binding constitutional limit on 

one body rather than the other? 

MS. FREELAND: Justice Sotomayor, I disagree 

with the premise of your question that this is an act of 

clemency similar to the reductions for good time 

behavior. 

The -- the term "clemency," "leniency," 

"grace," connotes the idea that you deserve to be 

punished for this, but we’re going to -- we’re going 

to exercise leniency --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Freeland --

MS. FREELAND: -- and give you a lesser 

sentence. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I take 

you on another path, not the question of the difference 

between the two -- two sections. We have a large 

prison population, and then Booker comes down, and then 

the guidelines change only as to crack cocaine, nothing 

else. All of the others whose sentence has become final 

cannot get into the court's door because they don't have 

the entering wedge. 

In what system -- what fair system would 

say, aha, because the crack cocaine guideline was 

reduced -- the disparity was reduced -- these people are 

now going to overcome the finality bar, but all of the

others who are identically situated with respect to all 

other factors, they don't get their sentences revised? 

MS. FREELAND: Justice Ginsburg, I have a 

couple of responses to your question. The first is that 

I think that a decision by a district court judge to 

correct a sentence under 3582(c) should be analogous to 

a decision of a district court judge to correct a 

sentence under 2255. 

Once the decision is made that the sentence 

should be corrected, finality is extinguished, and when 

the court goes about imposing the new sentence, it must 

comport with the law of the land at the time. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why should, bearing 

in mind that entire prison population similarly 

situated, the courts say it’s -- the finality bar is lifted 

only to the extent that the crack cocaine guideline disparity 

has been reduced? 

MS. FREELAND: And, Your Honor, once the 

finality bar is lifted, the concerns about retroactivity 

should slip away. But with respect to fairness, which I 

think is at the heart of your question, the fact that 

this partial remedy for an urgent and compelling 

problem, that is, the crack guideline, was afforded to 

some should not prevent the court from seeing justice 

for those like Mr. Dillon, even though there are some in

prison that are serving unconstitutional sentences that 

will not be able to seek relief. 

Mr. Dillon is properly compared to other 

defendants who were sentenced under the amended crack 

guideline, not the original crack guideline. His 

sentence is an amended crack guideline sentence, and for 

purposes of avoiding unwarranted disparities, Mr. Dillon 

is most comparable to those other defendants that are 

sentenced after the crack guideline. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you -- if you are 

right that this benefit goes to -- only to the class 

that can get in the door, wouldn't that be a powerful 

motive to the Sentencing Commission not to make its 

guidelines reductions retroactive? 

MS. FREELAND: Your Honor, I would certainly 

hope not. 994 clearly contemplates that the Commission 

will undertake a constant review and revision of the 

guidelines to make sure that they serve the purposes of 

punishment. And 994(u) clearly shows that Congress 

contemplated that some of those decisions would warrant 

retroactive application. 

If the Commission were to respond to a 

decision by this Court in Mr. Dillon's favor by refusing 

to revise the guidelines in the future or refusing to 

make any of those revisions retroactive, I submit that

it would be abdicating its duty under 994. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't say that. It 

just wouldn't do it. That's all. 

MS. FREELAND: You’re right, Your Honor. 

It just wouldn't do that, but history would speak for 

itself. The Commission has constantly undertaken this 

duty under 994(o). 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it’s certainly a 

factor that if I were -- if I were on the Commission, I 

would certainly take that factor into account. Every 

time I make it retroactive, it’s going to reopen --

going to reopen the whole sentencing and -- and allow 

a Booker application where -- where it didn't apply 

before. How can I close my eyes to that if --

MS. FREELAND: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if I’m making the 

retroactivity determination? 

MS. FREELAND: Your Honor, if I could, I’m 

not suggesting that the Commission close its eyes to 

anything. However, what we’re asking for in this case 

is not a full resentencing where all sentencing 

decisions would be reopened. We’re simply saying that 

when a court imposes a new sentence, that new sentence 

must comply with this Court's decision in Booker, and --

What if there is another constitutional objection

under the crack cocaine? Can you say, oh, and, you 

know, also, it violated my rights under equal 

protection? You didn't notice that before, but here's 

the argument. Is that before the sentencing court? 

MS. FREELAND: Your Honor, I would have to 

say that it is. The -- the new sentence --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, you would you 

have to say. So --

MS. FREELAND: The sentence imposed would 

have to comply with the Constitution. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's not only as 

unfair as Justice Ginsburg hypothesized. It's even more 

unfair than that, because just because of the crack 

cocaine change, somebody with an equal protection 

challenge gets to raise that. While somebody in prison 

without an equal -- with an equal protection challenge 

but not the crack cocaine one is still stuck. 

MS. FREELAND: That's true, 

Mr. Chief Justice, but that's the case in any situation 

where a defendant has raised an issue on appeal or has 

presented a claim in a 2255 petition, and just by

happenstance the decision awarding them a new -- a new 

trial or a new sentence happens when a new 

constitutional rule is announced by this Court. 

Now, certain --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's a new 

constitutional rule. This is an old one. This is one 

that was -- you know, the equal protection clause has 

been in the books for a while. And -- and he -- he just 

gets the chance to raise it solely because of the fact 

that his conviction involved crack cocaine. 

MS. FREELAND: And, again, Your Honor, I 

think that he would get to raise it, but I want to point 

out that not every constitutional issue would be ripe 

for the court's decision at that proceeding. If there 

were an opportunity to raise -- as you said, equal 

protection isn’t a new law like -- we’re talking about 

Booker being a new law for Mr. -- for Mr. Dillon. If 

there were an equal protection challenge that had not 

been lodged at the original sentencing, the district 

court would apply the law of the case and then --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no, no, no. I 

thought under your theory this is a whole new 

sentencing. So who cares whether he waived it at the 

first one? We’re starting from -- from point zero. 

MS. FREELAND: Mr. Chief Justice, I must

have misspoken. That is certainly not what I meant to 

indicate. What I meant to say is, certainly, all 

sentences imposed ought to comply with the Constitution, 

but we live in a system that has waiver principles, law 

of the case, mandate rule. These are all obstacles that 

a defendant seeking to overturn a sentencing or raise an 

issue on equal protection grounds that weren't presented 

before would serve as obstacles to their doing so. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And my point is that 

they shouldn't under your theory. The fact that he 

waived it at the earlier sentencing under your theory 

should not matter at all, because your theory is that 

this is a whole new sentencing, so who cares what went 

on in the prior sentencing? 

MS. FREELAND: I disagree, Your Honor, that 

my theory does not encompass that part of the rule. And 

I think with respect to our criminal history issue that 

we’ve raised that’s precisely what we’ve said, that 

there are errors that a district court may not be able 

to correct in a 3582(c) proceeding --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why do you -- why do 

you pick on -- on Booker as -- as not carrying over? I 

mean, if you say that there carries over from the prior 

sentencing his failure to raise the equal protection 

claim, why can't you say it's also law of the case that

the Booker objection doesn't stand? It's law of the case. 

It was decided before Booker, and that's the law of the 

case as far as that's concerned. 

MS. FREELAND: Well, Your Honor, if the law 

of the case were in place before Booker were decided, the 

new law would be an exception to the law of the case if 

Mr. Dillon were resentenced as he were after the Court's 

decision in Booker. 

I'm not sure if that answers your question 

precisely. For Mr. Dillon, Booker is new law at his new 

sentencing. He did not have an opportunity to raise a 

Booker objection or ask for a sentence below the 

guideline range at his original sentencing. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under your theory, 

there’s no bar to an upward sentence by the -- by the 

judge, because if it's a brand new hearing subject to 

Booker, which mandates complete discretion under 3553, 

the judges define the sentence that fits the crime and 

the defendant. So you don't mind an upward --

MS. FREELAND: Well, under 3582(c), Your 

Honor, statute -- the statute provides that it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I know you want --

MS. FREELAND: -- a sentence be only reduced

It doesn't make sense. 

MS. FREELAND: I think I understand your 

point. The -- the problem is with the statute. 3582(c) 

does not authorize a court to increase the sentence. 

The fact that a sentence cannot be increased 

does not divest the proceeding at which it’s imposed --

JUSTICE BREYER: So what's -- what's the --

the words in the statute is that it may reduce the term. 

You can’t change the term -- you cannot change a 

sentence, except that you can reduce the term if such 

reduction is consistent with applicable policy 

statements. 

MS. FREELAND: That's correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Do you see anything --

what's -- what's unconstitutional about that? Then they 

issue a policy statement, and the policy statement says 

you can't reduce it except insofar as our new --

If you’re arguing that that violates the 

Constitution, what I’m missing is why? What violates 

the Constitution in that? 

MS. FREELAND: Your Honor, post-Booker, what 

violates the Constitution is the policy statement's use 

of the word "shall." That's a -- that's a 

significant change --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't remember --

MS. FREELAND: -- in the wording of 1.10 

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought in Booker --

and I have to go back and look at it, but I thought in 

Booker the Court held that certain specific -- like 

certain specific words in certain specific provisions 

of the -- the sentencing statutes were unconstitutional 

because of Apprendi and because of the other part, 

Booker itself. 

Well, 3582 wasn't one of them. So -- so 

there must be something unconstitutional if you’re 

right. I don't see how you get around this statute. 

MS. FREELAND: Your Honor, in our view 

3582(c) is not unconstitutional. It --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If it's not 

unconstitutional, then why don't you have to follow it?

And the policy guideline says you don't get a reduction, 

except insofar as we’ve reduced a sentence in a 

particular respect. 

What's unconstitutional about that? I'm --

I'm not saying there isn't. I want to know what your 

argument is that it is unconstitutional. 

MS. FREELAND: Justice Breyer, post-Booker, 

if 3582(c) is interpreted as you just said, that the 

sentence -- the reduction in sentence must be consistent 

with applicable policy statements absolutely --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's what it says. 

I don't know how you’d interpret it some other way --

MS. FREELAND: And that the --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- if that's what it says. 

MS. FREELAND: And that the policy statement 

then requires the court to impose a mandatory guideline 

sentence --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, it just says what we're 

doing is we’re reopening the sentencing in respect to 

the particular way we reduce people's sentence, not in 

respect to something else. That's what I read the 

policy statement to say. That if there were 19 things 

that were considered in the sentence and one of those 19 

is changed in a downward direction, then it says we make

an exception, says the policy statement. You can reopen 

number 19, but not the first 18. 

Now, why is that unconstitutional? What in 

the Constitution prohibits doing that? 

MS. FREELAND: The -- Your Honor, if I could, 

the constitutional problem with section 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) 

is that it requires the district court to impose a 

sentence within the guideline range. Therein lies 

the problem. The requirement, a mandatory guideline 

sentence based on a judicially enhanced range --

therein lies the problem. 

Section 3582(c) does not mandate guideline 

sentencing. It's 1B1.10. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Freeland, what would 

happen if the -- the motion is made with respect to the 

crack cocaine, and the judge said, I'm -- I'm not going 

to -- I deny the motion? Would the judge then have to 

go on and consider Booker and say, now, on this piece, 

I deny the motion, but now I can just do whatever I want 

with the rest of it? 

MS. FREELAND: Your Honor, if I could, if a 

judge is presented with a 3582(c) motion and denies the 

motion, all the court has done is enter an order denying 

a motion. 

It's not until the district court decides to

grant the 3582(c) motion and reduce the defendant's 

sentence that 3553(a) factors come into play, the policy 

statements come into play, and a new sentence is 

thereafter imposed. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if -- suppose 

Congress and the Sentencing Commission had made it 

crystal clear that they are authorizing a reopening but 

only with respect to one piece. You say -- you say no 

matter how clear it is, as a matter of constitutional 

law, because Booker has been decided, the whole sentence 

is up for --

MS. FREELAND: Justice Ginsburg --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- consideration? 

MS. FREELAND: Justice Ginsburg, that’s 

correct. And the reason is because 3582(c) is a 

provision that is used by courts to correct sentences. 

Once the court decides that the defendant is worthy of a 

correction, that the sentence should be corrected, it 

grants a motion extinguishing the old sentence and 

imposes a new sentence. 

Our position is simply that when it imposes 

the new sentence, it must comply with Booker's 

constitutional and remedial holdings.

Justice Breyer's question. You want my better answer?

isn't even the provision for being guided by a policy 

statement of the Sentencing Commission that's 

unconstitutional. It is the nature of the Sentencing 

Commission's policy statement that is unconstitutional. 

Surely, if the Sentencing Commission had a 

policy statement which said you will reduce it for white 

prisoners but not for black prisoners, that would surely 

be unconstitutional, right?

3582 says is a -- a sentence can be reduced just as if, 

to go back to the beginning, Congress passed a statute 

or the Commission said everybody's sentence will be 

reduced. That doesn't change what the sentence was. It 

says there’s a reduction, like for good -- good time. 

So it says a defendant, if he has been 

sentenced based on factor 19 in the case, the court may 

reduce the term of imprisonment, the term of 

imprisonment there under the sentence. So I'm back to 

my question. 

What’s unconstitutional about that? 

MS. FREELAND: Justice --

JUSTICE BREYER: And what the court just says 

is the court -- the Commission says: That's right. You 

may reduce it in respect to what we’ve considered; you 

may not reduce it in respect to something which is 

not considered.

problem.

I got your answer. 

MS. FREELAND: Okay, thank you. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. FREELAND: A couple of points, though, 

that I -- that -- from reading the text of the statute 

that I’d like to point out. Justice Breyer, notice 

it doesn't say "sentence." It says "term of 

imprisonment." "Term of imprisonment" is -- is a term 

of art in the Federal Code. A "term of imprisonment" 

is an authorized sentence under 3551 of the United 

States Code. And under 3621, the Bureau of Prisons 

cannot hold someone in custody absent a sentence of 

imprisonment. 

And in this case, there are two judgments, 

two sentences of imprisonment. The Bureau of Prisons 

would not have been able to hold Mr. Dillon for 

270 months under the 1993 judgment, and the Bureau of 

Prisons certainly cannot hold Mr. Dillon for 322 months 

under the --

MS. FREELAND: Under 3621, it's very clear 

that the -- the Bureau of Prisons, absent a reduction 

under 3624(b) for good time, is directed to hold the 

defendant in the custody of Bureau of Prisons for the 

term of imprisonment on the judgment. 

In this case, following the --

President reduces the sentence using his pardon

of Prisons has to hold him for the full term of the

MS. FREELAND: Justice Scalia, I'm certain 

that that's not true. And I mean, there -- I’m not 

familiar --

him for the term of imprisonment. They -- they have to 

hold him for the term of imprisonment unless it has been 

shortened, right, by -- by pardon or remission of part 

of the term by the President or what the argument for 

the government is, or by application of this retroactive 

rule by -- by the Commission. 

MS. FREELAND: And again, Your Honor, I'm 

not familiar with the clemency and commutation 

procedures. I would have to think that some piece of 

paper, some order directing the Bureau of Prisons to 

reduce the sentence, just as a new judgment in a 3582(c) 

is a new sentence of 270 months, would have to be 

presented so that the Bureau of Prisons would release. 

But -- but that aside, the -- the real point 

here is that the new judgment is a new judgment; it is a 

new sentence. This is not a reduction in the old 

sentence. It --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that’s what it says. 

It’s -- the other thing that has bothered me, to tell you 

the truth, is -- is the part of the point that was brought 

up previously, that it is up to the Commission whether to 

make it retroactive. It is.

change, you see, and then make that retroactive, is 

going to reopen the sentencing for every single person 

who has already been convicted of a drug crime in the 

Federal courts, of which there are probably tens of 

thousands. 

And -- and I think they would properly take 

that into account. And, therefore, they might properly 

say, we're not going to make this retroactive. 

MS. FREELAND: Your Honor, the -- the 

practice in the court of appeals post-Booker of 

remanding all of the cases that were in the pipeline 

shows that the Federal courts are able to handle 

revisiting thousands of sentences imposed under a 

mandatory system to revisit them under 3553(a). And as 

Justice Walton said in testifying before the Sentencing 

Commission with respect to this issue, that the courts 

are fully prepared to handle any administrative burden 

and believes that such a burden would be sufficiently 

justified for people like Mr. Dillon who are deserving. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I’ll make this brief 

because your -- your rebuttal light is on. Your answer 

made sense when we talk about term as opposed to 

sentence, if you just look at (c). But (b) says, 

“Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence to imprisonment 

can be modified … a judgment of conviction that

includes such a sentence constitutes a final judgment.” 

Does (b) not apply to (c)? 

MS. FREELAND: (b) does apply to (c), Your 

Honor, and I'm glad that you raised that because 3582(b) 

is significant in that it does not distinguish the 

effect of finality of remands, modifications under 

3582(c); it's the judgment of conviction -- the 

conviction that remains final. The sentence is no 

longer final if modified under any of the provisions 

listed in 3582(b). 

If there are no further questions, I’d 

like to reserve the remainder of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MS. KRUGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act 

at issue in this case, unlike the provisions that were 

at issue in Booker, do not govern the imposition of 

sentence. They instead provide a discretionary 

mechanism for the exercise of leniency for defendants 

who have already been sentenced. The district court in

this case properly exercised its authority under the 

statute to reduce Petitioner's sentence by a little bit 

more than 4 years, which was the maximum amount of 

reduction that was consistent with the Sentencing 

Commission's specification under section 994(u) about 

whether and to what extent its crack cocaine amendments 

warranted reductions in already imposed sentences. 

The district court had neither a further 

obligation nor indeed the authority to set Petitioner's 

sentence aside altogether and resentence Petitioner 

under the advisory guidelines regime announced in 

Booker. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does that extend to --

which was part of this case -- the court notices that 

there was a technical error; it was a calculation error 

the first time, and the judge says, well, I’ll fix 

that up, too. That was an arithmetic error. 

MS. KRUGER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the same 

rule applies to the calculation error that Petitioner is 

raising. 

Section 3582(c)(2) wasn’t designed by 

Congress to serve as effectively a less restrictive 

substitute for raising such challenges on direct appeal 

or where otherwise available under section 2255. It was 

instead designed for the limited purpose of providing an

opportunity to extend leniency to defendants whose 

sentences are otherwise final, nonappealable, and 

therefore not subject to any modification. 

Justice Sotomayor, you had asked earlier 

whether this provision was designed as an act of 

clemency or was instead designed as a kind of adjunct to 

the court's judicial review power, a kind of 2255-type 

power. We think the answer is clearly that it was 

designed as a mechanism for the exercise of a type of 

clemency power. I think that’s particularly clear if 

you look at the parallel provisions in section 

3582(c)(1), which are reprinted at pages 3a and 4a of the 

appendix to the government's brief. 

Those provisions also provide for similar 

types of sentence reductions in cases where the director 

of the Bureau of Prisons makes a motion for sentence 

reduction based either on extraordinary and compelling 

reasons or because the defendant is over the age of 70 

and has served more than 30 years in prison. 

In all of these cases, the district court 

exercises a discretionary power to reduce the sentence 

in the exercise of leniency, not because of legal error 

but for equitable reasons. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that gets tied up, 

doesn't it, to your argument that this is not a part of

the criminal prosecution, that this is a -- not a Sixth 

Amendment proceeding, but -- not a Sixth Amendment 

proceeding, so it doesn't require constitutional 

protection? 

MS. KRUGER: That's correct, Justice 

Sotomayor. We think that what Congress has called for 

in all of the sentence reduction provisions of section 

3582(c) is a kind of discretionary mechanism for 

reducing sentences that are already final and 

nonappealable and can't be modified in any other respect. 

It hasn't called for a de novo plenary resentencing so 

to allow defendants in the position that Petitioner is 

in to come into court and reopen every aspect of their 

sentence, requiring reconsideration of guidelines 

determinations made in this case more than a decade ago 

or requiring application of intervening changes in the 

law. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct in 

understanding that 3582(c) was enacted prior to our 

decision in Booker? 

MS. KRUGER: Yes, it -- it was. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And is it clear that it 

should be construed as though the system was mandatory 

before the decision in Booker, rather than construed in 

the light of the remedial decision in Booker?

MS. KRUGER: Well, I think there are two 

questions that are raised here about how this statutory 

scheme comports with Booker. One is the Sixth Amendment 

question, whether this is a statutory provision that 

calls for a resentencing, at which Booker and its 

decision about the Sixth Amendment would apply. 

And then the second question is even if you 

think there is no constitutional problem with reading 

the statute in accordance with its plain terms, whether 

Booker's remedial analysis requires treating the 

reference to the policy statements in section 3582(c)(2) 

as purely advisory. 

We think with respect to that question, not 

even Petitioner is quite willing to embrace the full 

consequences of that argument. It would mean severing 

and excising the portion of 3582(c)(2) that requires 

consistency with the applicable policy statements. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Right. Is that any more 

a dramatic change than was made in the Booker remedial 

opinion itself? 

MS. KRUGER: I'm not sure whether or not 

it's a more dramatic change in terms of the number of 

cases that would be affected, but it’s --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the remedial opinion 

basically rewrote the whole statute on -- except first

it didn't have to reach 3582(c), but it certainly 

changed the -- the nature of the mandatory provisions 

that were previously in the statute. 

MS. KRUGER: That's true, and it did so in 

order to solve the constitutional difficulties that were 

created by a mandatory guidelines system with respect to 

the imposition of sentence. 

Without that same kind of Sixth Amendment 

violation in the context of discretionary sentence 

reduction proceedings, we think there is no basis in 

Booker's analysis for severing and excising any portion 

of 3582(c)(2), but I would note that the consequence of 

severing and excising the requirement of consistency with 

the applicable policy statements would be to free 

district courts not only from the Sentencing 

Commission's specifications about how much to reduce 

sentences, but also which of its amendments to the 

guidelines would justify retroactive application, 

because it is after all in a policy statement, section 

1B1.10, that the Sentencing Commission has specified 

which of its amendments, among many, justify sentence 

reductions under 3582(c)(2). That would mean that every 

time the Sentencing Commission revises its guidelines 

and reduces applicable sentencing ranges, any number of 

defendants would be free to come to the district courts

and ask them to make their own independent judgment 

about whether or not they should be effectively 

resentenced as a consequence. And that would certainly 

provide a significant disincentive for the Sentencing 

Commission ever to revise sentencing guidelines in a 

downward direction. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have there been other 

guidelines ranges that have been reduced, and, if so, 

were those also retroactive? 

MS. KRUGER: There have -- there have been 

many guidelines ranges that have been reduced over the 

course of the existence of the sentencing guidelines. I 

believe that right now, the current number of -- of 

guidelines amendments the Sentencing Commission has made 

retroactive stands at 27. 

This was the -- one of the first decisions 

that the Sentencing Commission made about retroactivity 

in the wake of Booker, and it did so with full 

consciousness of the potential for broadly reopening 

sentences. And it certainly weighed very heavily in the 

Sentencing Commission's deliberations that the 

traditional understanding, existing long before Booker 

was ever decided, was that 3582(c)(2) proceedings do not 

constitute plenary resentencings that incorporate all 

intervening changes to the law.

was an error in the calculation of the guidelines and 

she would like to have that error corrected, I didn't 

see anything in the policy statement that would prevent 

her from getting that correction. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think you told me -- I 

asked you that question, and you told me it could not be 

corrected, because everything was final. 

MS. KRUGER: That's correct --

JUSTICE BREYER: What in the policy 

statement? Because what it says is: What you're 

supposed to do is: Judge, you go and look at the 

guidelines that were applied. Now, substitute the 

new one reducing the sentence for the old one, and 

then go apply it. 

And, therefore, that seems to me not to 

block a claim that would say, when you apply these 

guidelines with the new one substituted for the old one, 

apply them; that is, if, in fact, there was an error 

the first time.

Booker applies, which the Sentencing Commission, based 

on a very long history of rejections and precisely 

that parameter. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I would have thought 

the objection to that is: No, they didn't make a mistake 

in applying Booker, because this Court has said that Booker 

isn't retroactive. 

MS. KRUGER: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: And, of course, they did make 

a mistake if it is retroactive. And then the Court should 

have said it is retroactive, in which case there would 

be no problem. 

MS. KRUGER: Well, if Booker were 

retroactive, I think that our position would still be 

that this is not the proper vehicle for applying it, 

that the proper vehicle would be to file a motion for --

to vacate or set aside the sentence under section 2255.

Congress didn't intend these sentence 

reduction proceedings to serve essentially the same 

purpose. It -- it intended them to serve simply the 

purpose of reducing otherwise final, nonappealable 

sentences. I would say --

JUSTICE BREYER: I know my word was: It 

shall leave all other guideline application decisions. 

Well, that's -- that's -- their claim is not that the 

guideline -- it's that they -- they chose the wrong 

guideline or they didn't apply the right words. You 

see, so they weren't applying that -- they just applied 

the wrong thing. Now you say I'm working too hard. 

Okay. 

MS. KRUGER: I think you may be working a 

little hard, Justice Breyer. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. KRUGER: I would say that, on that 

point, we also fundamentally disagree with Petitioner's 

submission that there was any error in the calculation 

of his criminal history score in 1993. 

But to the extent that Petitioner wanted to 

raise any challenges to that determination, we think the 

appropriate time and place to do that would have been on 

direct appeal of that sentencing decision, rather than 

waiting a decade and attempting to use the 3582(c)(2)

proceedings as a kind of vehicle for collaterally 

reopening that aspect of his sentence. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: When the judge considers 

the adjustment motion under the -- under the section, 

does he consider how the prisoner has behaved in prison; 

i.e., if he has behaved very badly, he doesn't give 

the -- the reduction? 

MS. KRUGER: The district court can consider 

any disciplinary proceedings that have occurred in the 

course of the defendant's imprisonment, yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But he -- but he can’t go 

below. 

The -- the Petitioner makes the argument 

metaphysically that there’s just a new sentence. In 

your view, is that refuted by the language of (c)(2) 

because they talk about in the case of a defendant who 

has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and then 

they say the term can be reduced, and it doesn't use the 

words "a new sentence shall be imposed"? I assume that’s 

your argument. 

MS. KRUGER: I mean, I think that that 

certainly reinforces the conclusion that I think also 

arises from other aspects of the provision, that what 

Congress had in mind wasn’t the imposition of a 

brandnew sentence, but simply a discretionary reduction

of the old one. I think that's right, Justice Kennedy. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I’m troubled by 

your response to Justice Kennedy's previous question, 

that the judge can take into account conduct in prison 

and all these other things. It does seem to open it up 

to other factors than the crack cocaine disparity, and 

once you’re looking at other factors, why not look at 

everything? 

MS. KRUGER: Well, I think the answer to 

that question is resolved by looking at the plain text 

of 3582(c)(2), Mr. Chief Justice, which directs that 

district courts have a discretion to reduce sentences in 

a manner that’s consistent with applicable policy 

statements, but after considering these statutory 

sentencing factors under section 3553(a), which 

include, of course, the need to protect the public from 

future crimes committed by the defendant, as well as the 

history and characteristics of the prisoner. 

The reference to 3553(a) guides district 

courts' discretion in deciding whether or not to grant a 

reduction that's authorized by the Sentencing Commission 

in the course of its statutory duty under 994(u) to 

specify whether and to what extent its amendments 

justify retroactive application. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, it's a one-way ratchet?

MS. KRUGER: Effectively. I mean, it works 

in both directions. It can justify granting a 

reduction; in the case of Petitioner, the district court 

thought that the 3553(a) factors clearly pointed in 

favor of granting the reduction. But it also -- those 

factors can work in the direction of denying an 

otherwise available reduction. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Petitioner's brief 

opens with a statement about his rehabilitation. We 

don't know if that has been contested. You don't 

respond to it. But let's assume that's all true. He 

established schools, and he helped young people and so 

forth. 

Does the Justice Department ever make 

recommendations that prisoners like this have their 

sentence commuted? 

MS. KRUGER: I am not aware of the answer to 

that, Justice Kennedy. It is certainly true that 

evidence of that type of rehabilitation factored into 

the government's recommendation in this case that 

Petitioner --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And isn't the population 

of prisoners in the Federal prisons about 185,000 now?

there -- how many commutations last year? None. How many 

commutations the year before? Five. 

Does this show that something is not working 

in the system? 185,000 prisoners? I think that’s the 

number. 

MS. KRUGER: I -- I'm not prepared to speak 

to that question today, Justice Kennedy. I can tell you 

that the government very much takes those considerations 

into account when making recommendations about available 

sentence reductions under section 3582(c)(2). 

And, indeed, in this case, the government 

agreed that the Petitioner should receive the full 

measure of the benefit that the Sentencing Commission 

had made available when it decided to make the crack 

cocaine amendments retroactive, based in large part on 

Petitioner's conduct in prison and his other 

characteristics. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? 

Accepting the point that there’s no constitutional 

compulsion that they had to open up for a full new 

sentencing, and I understand one reason for not doing it 

is that you don't impose too much work on the district 

courts for doing it, but could you explain to me why 

as -- just as a matter of policy and good judgment, the 

Commission would say, well, you can take a look at all

the negative factors that would argue against reduction, 

but you cannot look at any of the factors that would show 

why you should have had the same sentence that if -- why 

you should get the kind of sentence you would have 

gotten if you had been sentenced in the first place 

today? 

Because I guess this particular man is 

going to be -- spend 22 more years in jail than if he 

-- if he had been sentenced today. 

MS. KRUGER: The reason why the Commission 

doesn't do that is because it wouldn't comply with its 

statutory mandate under 28 U.S.C. 994(u) to specify both 

which guidelines amendments justify retroactive 

application and the amount by which sentences may be 

reduced. 

The Sentencing Commission would have no 

power to simply say in its policy statement: District 

courts, you are free to reduce sentences by however 

much amount you believe is appropriate. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: You think the statute 

would have prohibited a more generous policy statement, 

then? 

MS. KRUGER: I do think the statute would 

have prohibited such a policy statement. Yes, that's 

correct, Justice Stevens.

JUSTICE SCALIA: But I -- I still don't 

understand how you fit into that your answer to the 

Chief Justice earlier that, in fact, the court can 

consider other factors in -- in 3553 when it's making 

the reduction. 

MS. KRUGER: Justice Scalia, I think the 

answer is simply that the 3553(a) factors and their 

consideration under 3582(c)(2) is designed for a 

different purpose than for the consideration that goes 

into the initial imposition of the sentence. 

The point of considering the 3553(a) 

factors, to the extent they are applicable, to use the 

words of 3582(c)(2) --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MS. KRUGER: -- is just to determine whether 

or not the district court will grant a reduction that is 

authorized, to the extent it is authorized, by applicable 

policy statements. It’s not to determine whether the 

resulting sentence, as an original matter, is greater 

than necessary to comport with the statutory sentencing 

factors. It's simply for the limited purpose of 

deciding whether to exercise discretion to reduce the 

sentence in a manner that’s authorized by the statute. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. But -- but I

behavior in that determination? But that isn't --

that isn't a factor that would cause you to disallow 

the reduction. It's a factor that --

MS. KRUGER: It's a factor that would cause 

you to permit the reduction, presumably. It's one of 

the many considerations that a district court can take 

into account in deciding that it will, in fact, exercise 

its discretion to reduce the sentence to the extent that 

that’s permitted by Congress and applicable policy 

statements. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it -- it's also 

a factor that would -- might guide the district court to 

a decision not to reduce the sentence. 

MS. KRUGER: That's correct. It can point 

in either direction in any given case. 

But the critical point is that Congress has 

set the parameters for the district court's exercise of 

discretion in these proceedings. Whatever the district 

court chooses to do has to be consistent with applicable 

policy statements, including the Commission's policy 

statement in which it’s implemented its statutory 

authority to specify whether and to what extent its 

guidelines amendments will justify retroactive 

application.

Ms. Freeland, have you 3 minutes remaining.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Three. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA B. FREELAND 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MS. FREELAND: Three minutes, thank you. 

A couple of points. I wanted to answer 

Justice Kennedy's question. The court is not only 

permitted to consider bad behavior in prison; under 

1B1.10, the court is required. The word is "shall." 

And, so, all of these things and many of your questions 

point to the fact that this is an adversarial 

proceeding. 

Section 3582(c) describes a sentencing. It 

requires the court to consider all of the 3553(a) 

factors. It requires the court to be consistent with 

policy statements. It requires the court to impose a new 

sentence. 

And the word "modification" that’s used in 

3582(c) connotes correction, not leniency, not grace.

Those are the functions of the executive branch, not of the 

judicial branch. And, in this context, the court decided, 

after the Commission reduced the sentencing -- the 

sentencing guidelines for crack offenders, that a 

correction was warranted. There was an error in the 

prior sentence that 3582(c) permitted the district court 

to correct, and when it imposed a new sentence, that new 

sentence has to comport with current law. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can I get you to go back 

to -- you said something that only the executive can grant 

clemency or ought. What -- what about a program where a 

district judge says I'm going to have this person undergo a 

course -- a drug addiction course, and if the defendant 

successfully passes the course, then I’ll give a 

lighter sentence? That -- that --

MS. FREELAND: Justice Ginsburg -- I'm 

sorry. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did your answer exclude 

that -- that possibility? 

MS. FREELAND: Justice Ginsburg, your 

hypothetical -- the court is imposing a sentence or 

conditions of a sentence, and once those conditions have 

been met, the defendant is relieved, just as when the 

conditions of a sentence of imprisonment have been met, 

the defendant is released from prison.

One point that I’d like to get back to, 

because there were many questions about it, is this 

consistent with policy statements? Policy statements by 

definition do not bind. The Sentencing Commission in 

this case changed the 1B1.10 to say that the sentencing 

court could not, shall not, impose a sentence below the 

guideline range. 1B1.10 for all of the 26 retroactive 

amendments that preceded the crack amendment read 

district courts should sentence within the amended 

guideline range, and that’s appropriately a policy 

statement. 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) is not a policy statement. 

It purports to be a binding rule. And as this Court 

knows, policy statements do not bind. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but they do if 

Congress says they do. 

MS. FREELAND: When Congress says consistent 

with policy statements -- and, Your Honor, I would 

direct you -- I see my red light is on, if I could 

finish --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can answer 

Justice Breyer's question. 

MS. FREELAND: I would direct you to the
