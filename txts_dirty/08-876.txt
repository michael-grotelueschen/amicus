 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 08-876, Conrad Black 

et al. v. The United States. 

Mr. Estrada.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. ESTRADA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 For two decades, courts of appeals 

confronting Section 1346 have been unanimous on, at 

most, three points.

 The first one is that the unvarnished text 

of the statute is vague, amorphous, open-ended, and 

essentially, not very helpful.

 The second one is that a meaningful attempt 

to construe the statute can take place, if at all, only 

in light of a body of law that this Court rejected in 

McNally and Congress likely intended to restore in the 

act.

 And the third is that this exercise is 

fraught with due process and federalism problems and 

risks the creation of common law crimes, especially in 

the private sector where the pre-McNally precedent was

not well-developed.

 The principal question in this case is 

whether a prosecution may be sustained under a 1346 

theory, under a theory that was not successful before 

McNally and, in fact, had been affirmatively rejected, 

even in the heyday of the intangible rights doctrine. 

Because the answer to that question is "no," all 

convictions in this case must be reversed.

 It would be well to start by acknowledging 

that the root difficulty in this case is that this Court 

asked Congress to speak clearly, and Congress did not do 

that.

 As a result, there is no solution that is 

really capable of providing an -- an elegant out to the 

morass that the lower courts have been confronting, but 

the choices, essentially, fall on three categories.

 And the first is to return the matter to 

Congress, either because the statute is vague in all of 

its applications, both public or private, or as to 

private conduct, because there are not enough guideposts 

for judicial decision-making to give meaning to the 

statute.

 The second category of choices --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you don't ask for 

the first, do you?

MR. ESTRADA: Yes, we do. I mean, we -- we 

have -- we have written a question that necessarily has 

that as a predicate, which, under this Court's cases, 

leave that predicate open to the Court. We have an --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are -- are you saying that 

unless we adopt the limiting instruction that you 

propose, the statute is then vague?

 MR. ESTRADA: We have argued that. It is 

also -- you know, just to -- just to finish painting the 

picture, Justice Kennedy, we have -- we have the trunk 

of a tree, and that's -- you know, the statute, is it 

vague or isn't?

 Then we have the question of whether there 

is a limiting construction, and Professor Altshuler, for 

example, has made a case that limiting the statute to 

bribes and kickbacks is a possibility, as that being, 

arguably, the only core conduct that Congress could have 

contemplated.

 And -- and the third one is to go beyond 

bribes and -- and kickbacks, and to expand the statute 

to what Congress likes to call self-dealing or 

non-disclosure, which is really a wholesale takeover of 

State commercial law.

 In our view, if the Court is disposed to 

reach that far into the third category, it is essential

that the restrictions that had been recognized before 

McNally be enforced against -- against the government, 

but we have briefed the case in the way we have to 

this -- basically assuming that this tree is not 

imaginary and actually exists --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your theory -- your 

theory that return to the pre-McNally cases would help 

you is based almost entirely on the D.C. Circuit case --

case in Lemire -- Lemire.

 MR. ESTRADA: I think that is not a fair 

statement, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the D.C. 

Circuit's opinion, of course, is indeed very helpful, 

but it was a -- a distillation of what other courts of 

appeals have told the government again and again, in 

Ballard in the Fifth Circuit, in Feldman in the Seventh, 

in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the 

government tells us it was an outlier.

 MR. ESTRADA: Well, it had a different view, 

as we have pointed out, when they filed the brief in the 

Carpenter case. But the fact is, whether it is or it 

isn't can be judged by what the contemporaneous cases 

were.

 And Von Barta, Dixon, all cases in the 

Second Circuit, Feldman in the Seventh, Ballard, all had

indicated that this was a requirement of the theory in 

intangible rights cases.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, since the -- since the 

body of pre-McNally lower court cases was hardly 

completely consistent, do you think this is a workable 

approach?

 MR. ESTRADA: The honest answer is: I do 

believe that the statute is vague in all of its -- all 

of its applications, and I am happy to explain, quickly, 

because of that, why that is.

 Obviously, there are obvious problems of 

notice with the statute. The more fundamental problem 

with the statute, as if the notice problems were not 

enough, is in the second prong of the vagueness 

doctrine, which is the conferral of discretion to select 

the defendant on the government, and in particular, the 

prosecutors. And this is a situation not unlike that as 

was outlined by Justice Breyer's concurring opinion in 

the Morales case.

 And what he pointed out, pointing to cases 

like Coates v. City of Cincinnati, was that a statute 

that essentially confers discretion on the -- on the 

police and the prosecutors to select the quarry and come 

up with that appropriate justification to sell to the 

Court later --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know what's so 

discretionary and harmful about a bribery or kickback 

case. Let's take just the limiting principle of the 

trunk.

 Whether it's in the private or the public 

sector, why would, offering, there be any discretion or 

any sense of vagueness about saying: It's illegal to 

give a bribery?

 MR. ESTRADA: I --

JUDGE SOTOMAYOR: To get a contract, to pass 

legislation, it's illegal to take a kickback. There is 

nothing seemingly vague about that or seemingly 

troublesome about prosecutorial discretion in those --

at least those two situations. We could then go to the 

self-dealing question.

 MR. ESTRADA: I absolutely agree with the 

statements that you made, Justice Sotomayor. It is 

undoubtedly true that a -- that a statute that 

proscribes bribery or kickbacks can constitutionally be 

written, if that is what the statute says.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not your -- it's 

not within your test, as I understand it. Your test is, 

there has to be economic harm to the person owed the 

duty of loyalty.

 Now, you could have a bribe or a kickback

that will line the pockets of the person who takes it, 

doesn't deceive the person who is giving it, and doesn't 

harm the company to whom a duty of loyalty is owed.

 So it seems to me that the bribe and 

kickback, which I think is heartland McNally, would not 

be included in yours. It must be economic harm, actual 

or contemplated, to the person owed the duty of loyalty.

 MR. ESTRADA: I think that is not a fair 

statement, Justice Ginsburg, because in our economic 

system, I think it is fairly inferable, and any jury 

could so find that if you are a supply agent for a 

corporation and you are taking a bribe of $10,000 to 

steer the contract to Company X, Company X would be more 

than happy, and it would be a matter of indifference to 

Company X to just give a 10K break to your employer.

 So it is inherent in the economic system in 

the private sector that if you're talking about bribes 

and kickbacks, there is an obvious, though perhaps not 

fully quantifiable, risk of loss to the person to whom 

the duty is owed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The problem with the bribe 

or kickback explanation, unlike -- or you contend, 

unlike yours, is that there's no basis in the statute 

for limiting it to that.

 MR. ESTRADA: I think, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, we -- we can't find 

a statute that says, "No person shall commit a bad act." 

We can't find that to be non-vague as applied to murder. 

Everybody knows that murder is a bad act. Would that --

would that law be constitutional?

 MR. ESTRADA: No, and that was going to be 

the second part of my answer to Justice Sotomayor, and 

it is a point that Justice Breyer also made in the 

Morales case, taking -- taking the example of Coates v. 

City of Cincinnati where the law basically said, "You 

shall not engage in annoying conduct."

 Now, as Justice Breyer pointed out, many of 

us would agree 100 out of 100 that certain things are 

definitely annoying. And the fact that you could find, 

for example, that an assault is annoying does not mean 

that this statute gives notice that -- that, you know, 

your conduct is -- is within its written terms --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let's say you have a 

bank that is going to be opening up a lot of branches in 

the State, and one of the directors knows this and knows 

where they are going to open them. And he goes around 

and buys up the real estate where the bank is going to 

put its -- put its branch, so that he gets the benefit 

of the -- of the sale. And assume that the price that 

-- that he's going to charge is a fair market price, no

different than what anybody else would charge.

 Now, is that sort of self-dealing covered 

under your view of the statute?

 MR. ESTRADA: Well, I think that sort of 

self-dealing likely would be covered, not under my view 

of the statute, but under Carpenter, because if you were 

stealing confidential information from your employer, 

and the Court in Carpenter did say that confidential 

information is a -- is a form of property as a matter of 

Federal law --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he is not 

stealing -- he is not stealing the confidential 

information. As the director, he has the perfect right 

to know the confidential information.

 MR. ESTRADA: But under either view, if you 

are going to steal the corporate opportunity, that, too, 

is a form of property, and in fact, the property counts 

in this very --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I don't know 

that I would call it a corporate -- I don't know if I 

would call it a corporate opportunity. They are not 

looking to sell the land; they need to buy it.

 MR. ESTRADA: Precisely, but -- but this is 

not unlike cases like O'Hagan, or even Carpenter itself, 

in which, you know, the value of the use of the

information comes from learning the confidential plans 

of your employer. And in those circumstances, Carpenter 

said that the information itself could be a form of 

intangible property.

 And so that is a different problem than a 

native duty violation, which is what we are dealing 

here.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just while we are on the 

Oeschler thing, and then you'll probably want to go on 

to the other thing.

 Assume this trial were held again. The 

government said: All the same evidence -- same 

evidence. Would that evidence suffice for an 

instruction to the jury? Could the case go to the jury 

under the Oeschler theory?

 MR. ESTRADA: Under the obstruction, or -- I 

mean, under the -- under the kickback --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Kickback or bribe.

 MR. ESTRADA: No, it couldn't. I mean, part 

of the point I was going to make is that under any of 

these choices, whether the statute is vague or 

unapplicable to private conduct, choice one, or whether 

it is a kickback or bribe, choice two, there would not 

be a case to send to the jury for the defendants in this 

case.

The only argument comes up if you really 

want to climb to the thinnest reed of the thinnest 

branch and say that it could extend to naked 

non-disclosure of confidential information or use of 

confidential information in violation of a duty imposed 

by contract or State law, or maybe even a consent 

decree, as in Sorich.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Estrada, let -- let me 

pursue the notion I -- I floated earlier, that the 

problem with Professor Altshuler's approach is that 

there is nothing in the text of the statute that would 

enable you to limit it to kickbacks and -- and bribes. 

Is there anything in the text of the statute that makes 

your proposal any better?

 I mean, to be sure, it does -- it does make 

this a kind of fraud, and in the past, fraud did require 

injury to somebody. But it defined a new kind of fraud, 

namely, fraud that consists of the deprivation of honest 

services. That's the fraud. That, in and of itself, 

under the text of the statute, I take to be the fraud.

 MR. ESTRADA: Your Honor, I don't think that 

I can give an answer that would be fully satisfactory to 

a pure textualist, that this can be taken out of the 

words of the statute.

 As a practical matter, however, if you

consider the legislative record, and the avowing hint to 

restore some part of what McNally had thrown out, then a 

harder question comes up, and the issue of what that was 

actually becomes highly relevant. But I do not think 

that, even under the textualist view, it is fair to say 

that Congress went in the private sector from a view of 

fraud that is -- that was classically property kind to a 

view of fraud that has nothing to do with property.

 And the reason for that takes understanding 

what -- what the problem really was that Congress was 

trying to fix, and that the intangible rights cases were 

trying to fix. And it's really one of symmetry.

 It has always been the case that mail fraud 

is a specific intent crime. And it has always been the 

case, and this is clearly stated in cases like Regent 

Office Supply and Dixon, from Judge Friendly, that a 

part of the specific intent to defraud is an intent to 

harm. Now, in classic fraud, the defendant intends to 

harm the victim by obtaining, in a corrupt manner, his 

property. So there is a perfect symmetry between the 

intended harm to the victim and the expected gain of the 

defendant, because the gain comes from the victim's 

pocket.

 The problem of bribes and kickbacks that the 

intangible rights cases were trying to deal with is not

that they were trying to dispense with the harm's 

requirement to the victim; they were trying to deal with 

the lack of symmetry where the person given the payoff 

is not deceived and the harm to the victim is 

non-quantifiable. And to fix that problem, you could 

say that this statute could then say that the term of 

art, as the government calls it, that Congress used was 

intended to cover that situation.

 Now, the proof in the pudding on that comes 

from a very well-known case. Let's take, you know, the 

Holzer case, which was cited extensively by Justice 

Stevens in his dissent in McNally. You may recall it 

was a State court judge who had been taking bribes, and 

his conviction was affirmed in an opinion by Judge 

Posner, which he cited in this case again, which 

appears, I think, at 816 F.2d, and it was just a 

straight intangible rights affirmment. He sought cert, 

you know, Judge Holzer did, and he got a GVR in light of 

McNally. And Judge Posner got the case back.

 Judge Holzer goes back and there is a second 

opinion, 840 F.2d, and Judge Posner has to conclude that 

Judge Holzer has to be let go on the mail fraud counts. 

And the reason he gives is: Look, the judge obviously 

got lots of money, but he didn't get the money from 

anybody who was deceived, and all of his victims, which

were the public and the litigants against whom the cases 

were fixed, those people didn't lose any money, so that 

under the McNally paradigm, because the money that Judge 

Holzer got in bribes did not come from the victims, that 

-- that judge had to be let go.

 And I think that that's part of what 

Congress clearly had in mind as was trying to fix.

 Now, I agree with your -- with your apparent 

antecedent view and what I call issue one in the case, 

that the way that Congress did it has been one of not 

complying with the request that this Court made. It did 

not make anything clear in a way that sets forth in the 

text what it does.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but 

presumably, the one thing it's odd to suggest Congress 

did was sort of run 1346 through 1341, when what it was 

trying to fix was the Court's understanding of what 1341 

provided.

 MR. ESTRADA: There are any -- there are any 

number of problems with how Congress chose to do this, 

Mr. Chief Justice. That is actually the tip of the 

iceberg, because if you look as a textual matter to the 

first words of Section 1346, you will see that this new 

amended definition of "scheme to defraud" applies to all 

of the offenses in Chapter 63 of Title 18. There are 11

of those.

 And in addition to mail and wire fraud, at 

least three of them -- bank fraud, securities fraud, and 

healthcare fraud -- used the phrase "scheme to defraud." 

And unless you are prepared to try to save the statute 

by -- by trying to identify a core of what Congress was 

trying to do that is squarely anchored in the 

pre-McNally law, which may or may not be a successful 

enterprise, you do not have any textual guidance that 

will tell you whether this theory that the government 

likes to state at a very high level of generality would 

not become a deus ex machina in a number of other 

statutes that we have yet to -- to hear from. And that 

is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if I think 

that even -- I mean, much of your case is directed to 

the point that you -- you have to narrow it this way to 

avoid constitutional problems.

 What if I think you don't avoid 

constitutional problems?

 MR. ESTRADA: Then it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why should -- why should I 

turn somersaults to -- to come out with the -- with the 

interpretation that you want?

event, we fully support -- actually, we support anyway 

-- the -- the brief that was filed by the Chamber of 

Commerce and the National Association of Criminal 

Defense Lawyers, for the proposition that as an 

essential matter, this statute cannot be saved.

 I am merely pointing out, Justice Scalia, 

that for somebody who is not a textualist, that question 

may not be as clear-cut.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where in 

the record do we find your argument that the statute is 

unconstitutional?

 MR. ESTRADA: We made it -- we made it in 

the district court in a motion to dismiss the 

indictment, and I don't believe that is part of the 

joint appendix, but it is Docket Entry 261.

 And in that same motion, we argued that this 

statute, if it were to be applied at all, had to be 

interpreted solely as a matter of Federal law, which

finally now taken in the Weyhrauch case. And we argued 

based on the Jerome case and Cleveland case, which are 

the cases that the government has finally discovered.

 We argued again in the court of appeals, and 

we argued expressly that although the Seventh Circuit

constitutionality of the statute against a vagueness 

challenge, that Judge Easterbrook, writing for the court 

in Thompson, had left open the possibility that they may 

yet find a case in which that would be revisited. And 

we expressly argued that this was the case for which 

Thompson had left the -- the question open.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, what about --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Under the test that you 

propose, is the test the same? Does the statute read 

the same way, and is the test the same for private and 

public officials?

 MR. ESTRADA: No. No.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then we -- then if 

we accept your view, we have to have one subset of 

definitions for private officials and another for public 

officials. It's hard to do that under the statute.

 MR. ESTRADA: That is a problem that is 

inherent, as I said earlier, in trying to do anything to 

save the statute. But let me say --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, under the judge's 

bribery case that we just -- that you discussed earlier, 

couldn't you take the position that that money the judge 

took as a bribe really should have been paid to the 

government?

 MR. ESTRADA: Well, oddly enough, that was

an argument that was made to Judge Posner and remanded, 

the Holzer case, and Judge Posner said, Well, that is 

really untenable.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that would fit your 

test, though.

 MR. ESTRADA: Well, yes, in a -- in a very 

formal way. But -- but if I could say just one word on 

the question of the public v. Private distinction, 

Justice Kennedy, because I think it is important, in 

trying to figure out how one goes about trying to fix 

what is basically a mess, you have to keep in mind that 

the courts had accepted the intangible rights theory 

before McNally, and which Congress presumably and -- or 

likely was trying to bring back, had -- had not taken 

the view that they were doing something other than 

fraud.

 But they have taken the view that there was 

a basis in the concept of fraud for distinguishing 

between the public and the private, even before McNally. 

And some of this -- this is found in the briefing in 

McNally and is set forth in Justice Stevens's dissenting 

opinion, that there was this other statute, Section 371 

of 18 U.S.C., the conspiracy statute, that uses the 

phrase "conspiracy to defraud the United States."

 And on the basis of that statute, before

McNally, the courts of appeals have -- have ruled that 

an intent to interfere with the property rights of the 

government was not an element of the core meaning of the 

fraud. And the reason for that was that since 1905, in 

a case called Hask v. Henfold, and followed later by a 

case called Hammerschmidt, this Court had said that in 

order to be convicted of defrauding the government under 

this other statute, no need -- there was no need to show 

that the government's property interests were -- were 

interfered with solely --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you were --

I think you were about to tell me where you raised it in 

the Court -- the constitutional argument in this Court?

 MR. ESTRADA: We -- we raised that as a 

predicate for our question presented. And we said this 

is vague, but -- but if -- but if you do not accept this 

proposed restriction that has been accepted by the -- by 

the courts of appeals, then you would really have to 

take the -- take the step of actually striking it down.

 If you are asking whether we tendered it as 

a separate question presented, the answer to that is no, 

Mr. Chief Justice, but under this Court's cases that is 

not needed. And the cases that I would direct the --

the Court to for that proposition are -- some of them 

are cited in the Chambers brief. And the first one is

U.S. v. Grubbs, where this Court said that in a case 

involving the technical sufficiency of a search warrant 

it was, of course, open to the Court to consider whether 

the particular type of warrant, an anticipatory search 

warrant, was categorically improper under the Fourth 

Amendment. And -- because, as the court explained, it 

was an antecedent question that was a predicate for a 

logical disposition of the actual question in front of 

the Court.

 In doing that -- that, by the way, was a 

unanimous opinion by Justice Scalia.

 In doing that, you know, the Court cited to 

the case of Wilkinson v. Austin, which was another 

unanimous opinion, this time by Justice Kennedy. In 

that case the issue on which cert had been granted was 

the -- the question of what process was due to a -- to a 

prisoner in State custody.

 And the State of Ohio, that case had 

affirmatively conceded that there was a liberty interest 

and that the suggestion of the United States as amicus 

-- the Court concluded that whether or not there was 

even a liberty interest was an antecedent question and 

was a logical predicate for -- for the intelligent 

consideration.

and explain why any error in the honest services 

instruction wasn't harmless as applied to the 

Forum/Paxton transaction?

 MR. ESTRADA: That's -- that's Count Seven?

 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes.

 MR. ESTRADA: Well --

JUSTICE ALITO: As I understand it, there 

was no evidence there that the $600,000 was a -- a 

recharacterized management fee; isn't that correct?

 MR. ESTRADA: No. The argument on that, 

Justice Alito, was entirely different. The -- the 

record does show that the executive committee of 

Hollinger and the full board unanimously, including 

every member of the audit committee, had approved the 

execution of the noncompetes with Paxton and -- and 

Forum. And the only other evidence as to why they were 

not in fact executed as contemplated by the board 

resolutions was Radler's testimony that Kipnis simply 

forgot.

 Now, significantly, after the jury came back 

and found all three of the defendants guilty on that 

count, Judge Sansieve entered a judgment of acquittal 

for Kipnis on Count Seven, finding that the evidence was 

insufficient as to him. And if there are no further 

questions, I would like to reserve my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 The Petitioner today has sought to present a 

question to this Court that he chose not to include in 

his questions presented, whether the statute is 

unconstitutionally vague in all of its applications.

 What he did present in his question 

presented to this Court is whether there is an element 

of contemplated economic harm inherent in the concept of 

fraud in Section 1341, so that any honest services 

prosecution must show contemplated or foreseeable 

economic harm in order to be sustained.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But I don't -- I don't have 

the heart to inquire into that question if I think that 

the whole statute is bad. And that's the point he is 

raising, that it's -- it's a predicate to our 

considering that question, that if you agree with him, 

you think the statute will be sustained.

 But if I think the whole statute is bad, 

what -- you know, why should I engage in -- in this 

exercise?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Scalia --

 MR. DREEBEN: Maybe you should wait for a 

Petitioner who presents the question, rather than 

granting relief to a Petitioner who chose not to raise 

the constitutional issue in this Court --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's a little --

it's a little odd that you -- you would say that an 

argument that shows a way the statute can be saved 

cannot be -- cannot be presented.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, he's saying the 

statute could be saved, if at all, if you adopt this --

this construction. And if you do, his -- his conviction 

must be set aside.

 MR. DREEBEN: I think that the Court should 

reach that issue, the issue whether there is 

contemplated economic harm as a requirement for the 

statute, and the government briefed that issue, and I 

disagree with Petitioner that contemplated economic harm 

is either an element of the statute or necessary to save 

its constitutionality.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on the other hand, 

if we just can't find a -- a grounding in the statute 

for it, then that's because the statute's there.

Kennedy, is Congress's effort to reinstate the body of 

law that this Court held was not a valid construction of 

the mail fraud statute.

does the government feel that it hasn't had an adequate 

opportunity to brief the constitutionality of the 

statute?

view -- no, I'm just -- I'm cutting into you because I 

don't -- you answered it once you said that.

government feel, in order to have a full opportunity to 

brief constitutionality, that we should issue an order 

saying: Please brief the constitutionality?

that is a necessary question to resolve, then it should

be briefed in a supplemental passage --

 MR. DREEBEN: But not in this case, because 

I think if a Petitioner comes to this Court and presents 

a particular statutory construction question and then 

seeks to smother in --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would be --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- does Skilling -- I'm 

sorry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Directly answer this 

question: Does Skilling present the pure question or 

not?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, because in Skilling, 

Justice Sotomayor, the question is whether an element of 

personal or private gain needs to be read into the 

statute in order to render it constitutional.

 Now, in all fairness to Mr. Skilling, he has 

not filed his opening brief; the government has not 

filed its response. So that case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We don't know if that's 

going to be --

Amendment rights or anything --

you agree that it would be very unusual if in June we 

announced the opinion in your case agreeing with you and 

then the next case announced that the statute is 

unconstitutional?

 MR. DREEBEN: Agreed.

Mr. Chief Justice, that the Court hold that it is 

constitutional. And I think that it should, because --

let me outline --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, just -- just so we --

we know what is -- what is going on here: It is not the 

case that the Petitioner here has said here that if we 

adopt his interpretation, it will render the statute 

constitutional. He doesn't say that.

 He says that if we adopt his interpretation, 

we can avoid reaching the constitutional question, 

because whether it's constitutional or not, it at least 

requires the -- the kind of financial harm that -- that 

he asserts. So he is not asserting that if we -- if we

accept his position, the statute is constitutional. I 

don't read his brief as saying that, anyway.

 MR. DREEBEN: That's probably a fair 

characterization of language in his brief, but it does 

bear note that he never asked this Court to decide that 

question.

 Now, the question that is before the Court, 

and I think it will illuminate the vagueness concerns 

that are on the Justice's minds, is: What does the 

statute mean? And the way to understand this statute is 

to recognize that when this Court held in McNally that 

the mail fraud statute did not protect intangible 

rights, Congress came back in response to this Court's 

invitation and said: Yes, it does; it protects the 

intangible right of honest services which had assumed 

the status of a term of art in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could it have been a 

term of art when the courts -- the lower courts were 

massively confused?

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, I think the 

description of the lower courts as massively confused is 

not correct. It's not a fair description of the cases.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, there wasn't even a 

uniform terminology in the lower courts. They didn't 

all use --

MR. DREEBEN: All of the lower courts used 

essential synonyms for what Congress sought to 

reinstate. They refer to the right of honest services, 

faithful and honest services, loyal and honest services, 

and they were talking about one thing: Divided 

loyalties of an agent or a fiduciary.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, as I hear that -- I am 

exaggerating, possibly, but I think every agent has a 

duty of loyalty to provide loyal and honest services to 

the master, master agent. Every worker is an agent of 

his master, the employer. So every instance in which a 

worker does not provide honest services to the employer, 

he has met your test.

 I think there are 300 -- perhaps there are 

150 million workers in the United States. I think 

possibly 140 of them would flunk your test.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, that's what 

worrying me. Now, why? Because -- I -- "Do you like my 

hat?" Says the boss. "Oh, I love your hat," says the 

worker.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? So the boss will 

leave the room so that the worker can continue to read 

the racing form. Deception? Designed to work at

reading the racing form instead of doing your honest 

work and, therefore, violation?

 Now, explain to me how your test does not --

and I think you can probably do it; I just don't 

understand it at the moment. Explain it to me, how your 

test does not make this statute potentially 

criminalizing 100 million workers in the United States, 

or some tens of millions?

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, I hope you 

give me a moment to explain my theory of the statute in 

response to your question. The statute covers bribes, 

kickbacks, and undisclosed conflicts of interest by an 

agent or fiduciary who takes action to further that 

interest.

 These were well-recognized categories of 

honest services violations. Virtually every circuit 

that examined the pre-McNally case law said these are 

the prototypical cases. Bribes, kickbacks, undisclosed 

conflicts of interest by an agent or fiduciary who takes 

action to further that interest. These are not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is that -- does 

the right to intangible services refer to an obligation 

that is legal or moral?

 MR. DREEBEN: Legal, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Only -- only legal?

So that if in a State their corporate law says conflicts 

of interest with respect to spouse and children must be 

disclosed, but conflicts of interest with respect to 

nieces and nephews need not, you would say you cannot 

use this statute to prosecute somebody who, under some 

abstract sense, should have told their employer that, 

"My niece is going to get $10 million if we go ahead 

with this contract"?

 MR. DREEBEN: Let me make two points in 

response to that, Mr. Chief Justice.

 The obligation under 1346 is a Federal 

obligation. Congress, by reinstating this body of law, 

by virtue of 1346, created a Federal obligation that is 

not dependent on State law. And I think we will address 

this more in the Weyhrauch case, where that issue is 

specifically presented, but it should not be understood 

as a State law obligation.

 Second, the core --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then what's the 

source -- and I think that's inherent in the Chief 

Justice's question -- what is it -- where did he draw 

the line and where do we go to look to where you draw 

the line on what information needs to be disclosed? 

Because if it's not a niece, my best friend is going to 

get a 1.4 million on this deal.

 MR. DREEBEN: The line is personal 

conflicting financial interests of the individual, which

private gain? Do I gain something as opposed to --

because that -- I know that is the Skilling case. But

MR. DREEBEN: I prefer not to address the

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but that's -- you 

have to, because you have to tell us what draws -- you 

have to give us the source or some source of limiting, 

of limitation. And that's what Justice Breyer has been 

talking about.

 MR. DREEBEN: I'm trying to do that, Justice 

Sotomayor. A personal conflicting financial interest is 

not subtle, it is ascertainable, it is core, it is the 

characterizing feature of the vast majority of --

precisely what you said, it seems to me in what I have 

labeled Altshuler alternative B, does that ring a bell?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, I don't know what 

Professor Altshuler's alternative B was.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes. You've read the 

briefs-- you've read the briefs. He has alternative A 

and alternative B. And alternative A he says kickbacks, 

and it could be limited to bribery or kickbacks. In 

alternative B he adds bribery, kickbacks and undisclosed 

self-dealing capable of causing economic harm. That's 

what I got out of the brief.

 MR. DREEBEN: I would not have --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now I just heard what you 

said and it sounded like the same thing.

 MR. DREEBEN: It's not the same thing and I 

think this goes back --

JUSTICE BREYER: It is not causing economic 

harm.

 MR. DREEBEN: Not causing economic harm 

because there are instances where important fiduciary 

relationships are breached personally. For example, 

doctor-patient, lawyer-client, union-union 

representative, where the harms are intangible; they are 

noneconomic; they were intended to be picked up by this 

statute. But to answer your question directly, Justice

 MR. DREEBEN: That -- that is -- implicates 

a -- one of the two important limiting principles on 

this statute which is materiality and intent to defraud. 

And I do not think that any jury would find and the 

government would be very foolish to prosecute that 

material --

do wrong." Sometimes adding, "in the opinion of the

having a statute that picks up 80 or 100 million people.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, the point that 

I was making is that this statute does not establish a 

free-floating federal crime based on a breach of a 

trivial duty. It requires materiality, as all fraud 

statutes do; it requires --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But defined how? That's 

what I'm -- I'm trying -- material in what way? Because 

if you don't how by an economic loss to the victim or by 

private gain to the -- to the perpetrator, then you are

 MR. DREEBEN: The issue of materiality --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That the -- for an 

auditor on April 14th his guy -- or April 1st his 

employee goes off to a ball game? It could be a huge 

economic loss to that employer by that employee's 

decision at that particular moment to go to a baseball 

game as opposed to working.

 MR. DREEBEN: I agree, Justice Sotomayor, 

but materiality as the Second Circuit said in the 

Rybicki opinion is a time-tested way of separating 

out --

said economic loss --

MR. DREEBEN: No --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that there has to be 

the risk of economic loss --

MR. DREEBEN: With all respect --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in the private 

sector.

 MR. DREEBEN: -- Justice Sotomayor, the 

Seventh Circuit in its Rybicki opinion in the en banc 

opinion did not say that, nor I think is it fair to say 

that the Second Circuit had ever said that economic loss 

was an element of an intangible rights fraud, either 

pre-McNally or post-McNally.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is -- I mean, I'm 

still waiting to hear what materiality consists. It is 

just -- de minimus doesn't count? Is that all you mean?

 MR. DREEBEN: Materiality, Justice Scalia, 

it takes the classic definition of your opinions for the 

Court in Kungis and Gaudin as reasonably likely to 

affect the decision of the body to whom the statement is 

made.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So if the employee would 

be fired if defalcation had come to light, that's 

material?

it would be. And I should add --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right, that's the ball 

game.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then that's the ball game. 

Hypo: you go to the ball game, the government --

MR. DREEBEN: No, it's not the ball game.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The employer finds out 

about it, he fires -- so it's material because you would 

be fired for it.

 MR. DREEBEN: Materiality isn't the only 

element. It's not a divided loyalties issue.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking about just 

materiality. Just materiality would be satisfied. You 

said that if the employer would fire, that is material. 

And then we had the ball game hypothetical. Then you 

said oh, well, and then some other thing. But we are 

talking just about materiality so you should stick with 

that question.

 MR. DREEBEN: I'll -- I agree, Justice 

Kennedy, and I intend to answer that question, but I 

think that it is fair to say, for me that by 

acknowledging that something can be material if the 

employer would take different action does not mean that 

everything that the employee does is a crime. The

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: He drives to the ball game

powers of his company, he is off on a frolic and detour.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Excuse me, may I ask you 

to put -- in terms of your brief, you said your 

definition of materiality -- you said materiality is 

related to but different from what Mr. Estrada is urging 

the Court to adopt: economic harm to the victim. So 

can you tell us how materiality is related to economic 

harm to the victim and how it is different from economic 

harm to the victim?

 MR. DREEBEN: It is related to it, Justice 

Ginsburg, in that in a business setting materiality will 

be in most cases coextensive with economic harm at least 

if economic harm is conceived as I conceive it, and as 

the cases have conceived of it as extending to things 

like harm to reputation that will interfere with a 

business's ability to go forward.

the racing form case. I mean, you are using materiality

in two senses. All you mean by materiality is that the 

misrepresentation must have been material, okay? So in 

the racing form case, let's say the question the boss 

asked is, you know, "Are you going to work hard this 

afternoon? Or do I have to stand here and look over 

your shoulder? " And he says, "Boss, I'm going to work 

hard this afternoon. " "Okay, then I'll leave." And the 

boss leaves. That representation is material in that it 

got the boss to leave, whereupon he reads the racing 

form.

 But you know, that's immaterial in another 

sense, it's a -- it's not a substantial crime. And 

that's -- that's what we are looking for here, something 

that -- that separates reading the racing form from 

really harming the employer --

MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to a substantial degree. 

And you have nothing in your -- in your brief or in your 

argument that eliminates these de minimus kind of --

what should I say --

MR. DREEBEN: Fraud.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Misrepresentations to the 

employer.

all -- what you are describing are all money or property 

frauds that could be charged if the government so chose 

so long as the mails or the wires were involved. The 

mail fraud statute doesn't by itself carve out de 

minimus frauds.

 The concept of materiality, though, in my 

concept of the divided loyalties that lies at the heart 

of honest services fraud, includes in itself the concept 

of an undisclosed interest that is important in some 

way, because the obligation of the employee, the agent, 

the fiduciary, the company executive, the politician who 

has been elected to office, is defined by a bedrock 

substratum of fiduciary duties that are universally 

recognized in the common law, that were --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, can I ask 

this? It seems to me that even if there is some 

economic harm amounting to the cost of a World Series 

ticket, that's all -- or the amount of gas used to drive 

to the ballpark, that could still not meet the 

materiality requirement.

 MR. DREEBEN: I agree with that, justice 

Stevens.

just based on economic harm versus everything else.

in the law of mail fraud in these issues but the scope 

of the duty that has been recognized in the pre-McNally 

cases had to do with the conflicts of interest produced 

by bribes, produced by people who took kickbacks, 

produced by self-dealing where somebody was selling his 

own product to the company but not disclosing that he 

had an interest in the company.

trying to find a way, so as I listen to you, I think 

what you are driving at -- a paradigm case of what you 

are driving at would be moonlighting.

Breyer, you mean somebody who has a business on the side

Self-dealing in the kind that I am talking about is 

where somebody has -- he is playing the role of loyal 

corporate employee, loyal corporate officer, but he is

JUSTICE BREYER: You have to have all those

company. Everybody has loyalty to the company owner. 

And, now, you are saying everybody has competing things 

that they sort of like to do, which would deprive the 

owner of the honest services, but you are saying, in

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Or is the problem the --

the self-dealing itself, the fact that the person is 

receiving a gain? There's where I'm trying to draw the 

line because I keep going back to -- what is the source 

of information that would put a limitation on how much 

you disclose or don't disclose?

 It has to be -- the issue has to be looked 

at differently, which is the evil is the self-dealing, 

the gain the person's receiving. I know, you don't want 

me to go there because of Skilling, but I'm troubled 

because the issue of disclosure creates a Federal common 

law of what's important to tell either the public or a 

private employer?

 And I don't know how to define that issue of 

importance --

MR. DREEBEN: Well, the real --

that it's a gain that the individual's receiving or 

something the individual's doing.

all it does is refer us to the pre-McNally cases, I'm 

at -- I'm at sea.

 MR. DREEBEN: I think that Petitioner and I 

agree that Congress wrote this statute with the use of 

the phrase "right of honest services" as a term of art, 

in order to refer to a body of law that it understood 

had a consistent core, and that core --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe it was wrong. Just 

because it understood it had a consistent core, it has a 

consistent -- consistent core?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, but it, in fact, did have 

one, and the reason that it had one, even though this 

Court held that the mail fraud statute did not protect 

the deprivation of intangible rights, there was, 

nonetheless, at the heart of the pre-McNally cases, a 

substratum of a universal common law rule of fiduciary 

duties and agency that has, as an undisputed and not at 

all vague core, that agents can't engage in undisclosed 

self-dealing.

 They can't --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, kickbacks and -- and 

bribes is clear. Sometimes, the government just talks 

about conflict of interest. Sometimes, it says, "taking 

action under conflict of interest." Well, action is 

quite broad.

And that's -- what do you include concretely 

within this self-dealing category? Taking or taking 

action on the basis of undisclosed information?

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, it's when 

the same person is on two sides of the transaction, so 

you have in, for example, this case, Mr. Black is going 

to receive compensation from his company, and on behalf 

of the company, he is authorizing and entering into 

alleged noncompetition agreements that recharacterize 

the money or, in a case of Count 7, I think Justice 

Alito is absolutely correct, outright steal the money.

 He --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, could I 

ask -- could I ask you just, in terms -- the terms of 

the statute, does your theory give any independent 

substance to the word "right"?

 It seems, to me, your argument is that --

that someone who deprives another of honest services. I 

don't know where the concept of "right" comes in, which 

is in the statute.

 MR. DREEBEN: The right refers, 

Mr. Chief Justice, to the acknowledgment that there was 

a common law fiduciary duty that was assimilated into 

the law of fraud, really, beyond dispute. I haven't

The -- the right is not limited to specific legal 

obligations, but to a developing Federal common law of 

criminal liability?

 MR. DREEBEN: No, it certainly is not, 

Mr. Chief Justice. Congress intended to basically say 

to this Court, you have determined that intangible 

rights are not protected under the mail fraud statute. 

Only money or property is.

 Congress desired to correct the statute by 

protecting frauds that involve intangible rights, and it 

did that by using a term of art that was replete 

throughout the legislative debates, for those who read 

them, as referring to the same core body of cases that 

we rely on here.

 And those cases -- any -- any legal rule 

will have cases at the margins, in which reasonable 

jurists will debate whether --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, I should know 

this, but refresh my memory. The body of pre-McNally

public rights versus private? Was there a substantial

public sector cases. There was a very substantial body 

of private sector cases, many of which were cited in 

Your Honor's dissent in the McNally case.

 And those cases, I think, as Mr. -- the 

Chief Justice indicated earlier, contained, but a single 

opinion, the Lemire opinion from the D.C. circuit, that 

talked about contemplated economic harm.

 Petitioner seeks to assimilate that, 

somehow, into the notion of an intent to defraud that he 

says was inherent in the mail fraud statute everywhere 

and always before McNally.

 But if he seriously believes in that theory, 

then he would have to say that a -- an intangible rights 

defendant would have to contemplate economic harm, 

foresee economic harm in any intangible rights case, 

which would knock out, immediately, many of the critical 

pre-McNally public official cases, in which a legislator 

takes a bribe for action that doesn't implicate the 

pecuniary interests of the holder or the fiduciary duty 

or in which a union official accepts payment for someone 

who wants to apply for membership. Membership fees are 

fixed. It's not as if the union is losing money.

 And it's really inconceivable that Congress 

would have passed a statute to say, we don't want this 

law to be limited to property rights. And somehow,

through the back door, smuggle in the same test of 

contemplated economic harm.

 What the right way to handle this issue 

is -- is to look at it under the rubric of materiality 

because materiality is flexible. It considers what the 

rights are of the particular fiduciary --

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought materiality just 

has to do with whether a false statement you make, in 

fact, causes the effect, or is likely to, that is the 

harmful effect.

 MR. DREEBEN: But the point, Justice Breyer, 

is --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's always there.

 MR. DREEBEN: -- that materiality would 

function much like the Petitioner's contemplated 

economic harm requirement in private sector, private 

enterprise cases.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, and the -- and the 

reason I say with -- maybe I have the example that I 

mean now. In the cases you just mention, the bribe 

case? Right, the legislature is not going to gain. The 

legislator or the briber might, but somebody will.

 And the object of those bribes was that 

there would be economic gain, and that was what -- when

test that will bring in like any failure to fill out a 

disclosure form.

 A deliberate failure to answer a box, one 

out of 1,000, for every government employee, would

 MR. DREEBEN: No, not immediately, because 

there needs to be an intent to defraud, which 

includes -- Mr. Chief Justice, if I might finish.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.

 MR. DREEBEN: -- which includes knowledge of 

the legal duty that the employee is violating and will 

include materiality. And these are the issues that 

screen conflicts and prosecutions in a variety of public 

corruption type cases, and across the board economic

MR. ESTRADA: Just a few points, 

Mr. Chief Justice. First, it bear emphasis that the 

government has once again said that this is a federal 

obligation.

 This entire case was tried based on Talmudic 

debates of the ins and outs of Section 144 of the 

Delaware law of corporations. We had motions to 

dismiss, we had briefing. The jury was given detailed 

instructions, and this goes to all of the fraud counts, 

Justice Alito. You cannot say that you can uphold 

something as harmless when the entire theory on which 

the case was tried actually has been changed at the 

Supreme Court of the United States.

 Relatedly, I would like to add, because the 

government said that count seven was a theft, that the 

government's theory on count seven was that the 

noncompetes were frauds from their inception, because 

the reps from Paxton and Forum, none was wanted. And in 

fact, other counts that charged Forum and Paxton, two 

and three, you know, the jury returned a verdict of 

acquittal. And as did Judge Sansieve on Kipnis on 

seven.

 And that makes it highly likely that -- that 

the jury convicted based on the government 's argument, 

that even though every single member of the audit

committee approved the noncompetes as a member of the 

board, that Delaware law required a separate and prior 

application to the audit committee.

 And if that's what the jury was told, you 

cannot really say that count seven is separate.

 Second --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where was that in the 

charge?

 MR. ESTRADA: Excuse me, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The charge -- the judge 

charged the jury in terms of Delaware law?

 MR. ESTRADA: Yes, yes, Your Honor. The 

jury was told -- let me find that, I think it's around 

page 336.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 336.

 MR. ESTRADA: Yeah, 336 and 337, and the 

jury was given detailed instructions as to how all this 

turned on whether the transactions at issue were, quote, 

entirely fair under Delaware law.

 And the jury was further told --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it said honest 

services include fiduciary duties under corporate.

 MR. ESTRADA: Correct. And then you then 

went to say that -- that, you know, Delaware was

duties, one of them is loyalty. Loyalty requires this 

and such under Delaware law.

 One of the things that -- that would allow 

the jury to convict was the notion that the government 

in entirely just has odds for understandable reasons, 

but this was not entirely fair. And a transaction could 

fail to be entirely fair if every disclosure that should 

have been made in accordance with Delaware law was not 

made.

 On the second point that I wanted to make is 

the question of whether we are really embarking on the 

federal common law of materiality.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I know you are 

running out of time, but you are speaking so fast I 

can't even follow you anymore.

 MR. ESTRADA: I apologize, Your Honor.

 The second question I wanted to address is a 

question that you raised, Justice Sotomayor, it is false 

to say that the materiality is a filter. Criminal law, 

just as a question of doctrine, has always looked at the 

mens rea, as the filter that takes out the culpable from 

the nonculpable. In this case, you know, the so-called 

filter is elusory. If you have a money or property 

case -- Your Honor, may I finish?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your thought.

 MR. ESTRADA: -- you know what the decision 

is that you are supposing to induce, whether you --

whether the person would part with the money. Here the 

but-for world, was the decision that the employer might 

make, do I dock his pay; do I give him a demotion; do I 

fire him for all purposes, or do I simply say, that I 

would not have authorized him to be absent at all for 

the ball game. None of those things is specified, and 

the entire test of the filter is as vague as the 

statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:18 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
