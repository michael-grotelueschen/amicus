 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm

too.

Russell.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. RUSSELL: By accepting Federal funds for 

its prisons, Texas consented to suit for appropriate 

relief for violations of the Religious Land Use and 

Institutionalized Persons Act. The question in this 

case is whether that appropriate relief encompasses 

damages. If you simply asked what kind of relief is 

generally appropriate against a State, the answer would 

be no relief, not even an injunction, because States 

ordinarily are not subject even to suit without their 

consent. And so RLUIPA necessarily asks a more precise

question, and that is what relief is appropriate against 

a State that has consented to be sued for violations of 

this sort. Damages, for example, are perfectly 

appropriate against a State that has consented to be 

sued for breach of contract.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, what would it be, 

Mr. Russell, if there were a suit under RFRA because a 

Federal penal institution was not allowing for the 

religious practices that the act protects?

 MR. RUSSELL: In -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In a suit under RFRA, 

could there be -- would damages be an appropriate 

remedy?

 MR. RUSSELL: In our view they are, although 

it's a different context, and we recognize that the 

government disagrees with us on that. We can't point to 

the Spending Clause-contract analogy that applies with 

respect to Spending Clause legislation as RFRA applies 

to the Federal Government. But there are other 

indications, including for example the long tradition of 

damages being appropriate relief for the violation of 

civil rights.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, could we back up. 

You are saying you could get them against the Federal 

Government too, but the government doesn't think so?

MR. RUSSELL: That is our view, although we 

recognize that RLUIPA is different in this respect, in 

that it's a Spending Clause statute under which -- and 

this Court's decision in Barnes v. Gorman makes clear 

that damages are traditionally appropriate relief for 

the violation of any Spending Clause statute.

 Of course, there is also a tradition that 

damages are for the violation of civil rights. Take 

statutes like Title VI, Title VII, Title IX, section 504 

of the ADA, the list goes on and on, where Congress has 

created damages as the quintessential remedy to enforce 

civil rights, and when Congress has subjected States to 

suits under such statutes, it has always put them on 

equal footing with other defendants and subjected them 

to damages as well. But even beyond that -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: But did it use such 

language as "appropriate relief"?

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, for example -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's the 

question. Our cases say it has to be clear to the State 

when they go into one of these schemes, it has to be 

clear what liability they are subjecting themselves to. 

And in these other cases I think it was clear. I don't 

think it's clear with simply the word "appropriate 

relief."

MR. RUSSELL: No, we are not saying that the 

word "appropriate relief" in itself supplies the 

clarity. It's looking at that language and the way the 

court interprets statutes generally, among other things, 

looking at the tradition of what constitutes appropriate 

relief for a violation of this sort.

 We do think that Barnes v. Gorman is 

appropriate precedent in telling the court -- in telling 

Texas what kind of relief is generally thought 

appropriate to satisfy Congress's desire to remedy 

violations of a Spending Clause statute.

 We recognize, of course, that Barnes didn't 

involve sovereign defendants, but the local governments 

in that case had the same rights as a State would. It 

just comes out of the Spending Clause rather than the 

Eleventh Amendment. That is, both constitutional 

provisions prohibit Congress from subjecting defendants 

to damages suits under Spending Clause legislation 

without their consent. And this Court has enforced that 

identical constitutional right with the same clear 

statement test derived from Pennhurst v. Halderman.

 Even more, the contract analogy the Court 

relied on in Barnes is no less apt simply because one of 

the recipients is a State.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The contract

analogy, I suppose, would provide that the meaning of 

the contract is interpreted against the drafter. Right?

 MR. RUSSELL: That would have been true in 

Barnes as well.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. So to the 

extent the State is arguing for a restrictive 

interpretation, it gets at least a little help from the 

fact that the Federal Government wrote the statute.

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, it gets the same amount 

of help that the local governments got in Barnes, which 

wasn't enough. And Not only does the analogy, I think, 

apply; so does the remedy. Damages are a quintessential 

appropriate remedy for breach of contract by a State so 

long as the State has agreed to be sued for violation of 

a contract.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Russell, the State 

looks at this statute and says, oh, this statute 

preserves the PLRA, and under the PLRA there are no 

damages without having a physical injury. So putting 

the PLRA together with "appropriate relief," PLRA is 

telling us it's not appropriate relief when there is no 

physical injury.

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, I would say two things 

about that. One, keep in mind that the PLRA limitations 

only apply to incarcerated individuals. It doesn't

apply to the people RLUIPA protects in State-run nursing 

homes or mental health facilities. So Congress wouldn't 

have been thinking that appropriate relief is defined in 

some sense by the scope of the PLRA.

 In addition, we think that the fact that 

Congress expressly said that the PLRA applies to limit 

the relief that's otherwise available under RLUIPA shows 

that Congress didn't think that the PLRA itself made the 

relief inappropriate. It's simply that there is some 

relief that is otherwise appropriate that will be 

limited in some circumstances by the PLRA.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in the prison 

setting, then, isn't it an academic question, because 

there are not going to be damages anyway?

 MR. RUSSELL: No, that's not true, for a 

couple of reasons. One, there are many cases involving 

pecuniary damages. There is destruction of religious 

items that won't be subject to the PLRA limitation.

 There are -- there are cases that give rise 

to pecuniary claims. So there is destruction of a 

religious item, a Bible or something like that.

 There are also cases in which the violation 

will result in a physical injury. There are cases where 

people are deprived of food for long periods of time. 

There is a case where a prison refused to transport an

inmate for medical treatment outside the facility 

because he wouldn't take off his yarmulke. Congress, I 

don't think would have thought that the PLRA limitations 

rendered a damages remedy unimportant. And at the very 

least -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does it include punitive 

damages?

 MR. RUSSELL: Excuse me?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does it include punitive 

damages?

 MR. RUSSELL: The statute, I think, does not 

in light of Barnes, because Barnes said that you get 

traditional contract remedies and punitive damages are 

not a traditional contract remedy.

 Beyond that tradition, though, there's also 

textual cues in the statue itself. There are three of 

them that I would like to focus on. I'll list them and 

then discuss them.

 One is the definitions section, which lumps 

States in together with local governments in the 

definition of "government." The second is the Federal 

enforcement provision, which specifically allows suits 

by the United States, but only for the equitable and 

declaratory relief that the State says is the only thing 

that's available under appropriate relief. And finally

is the fact that the statute separately already 

authorizes suits for injunctive relief against State 

officials, making the addition of suits against States 

effectively surplusage unless some other kind of relief 

is available against the State.

 Beginning with the definitions section, this 

Court recognized in the United States v. Nordic Village 

that where Congress, in the Bankruptcy Act, defined 

"governmental unit" to include both the United States 

and a State, that Congress was making clear, quote, that 

"States and Federal sovereigns are to be treated the 

same for immunity purposes."

 I think the same lesson comes out of the 

fact that RLUIPA defines "governments" to include not 

only States, but local governments, and subjects all 

governments to the same cause of action for the same 

appropriate relief. Congress was expressing there as 

clear as it could that there was a definitional 

equivalence between States and local government.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, but -- but, I mean, 

that means either that the Federal Government -- that 

the State government is liable for damages just as 

municipalities are, or that municipalities are immune to 

suit for damages just as the States are.

 I mean, that -- you don't know which way

that cuts, do you?

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, I will point you to 

other provisions of the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, maybe let's talk 

about them, then.

 MR. RUSSELL: Okay. One is the fact that, 

as I mentioned before, the statute -- and I think the 

State agrees -- already allows suits for injunctive 

relief against State officials in their official 

capacity. The only thing that adding States as 

defendant would accomplish in light of that would simply 

be a change in the caption of the lawsuit, unless States 

are subject to some relief that State officials under Ex 

parte Young are not.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, except this would 

be a violation of a statute, not a violation of a 

constitutional right. So under Ex parte Young they 

couldn't necessarily get an injunction.

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, I would set aside the 

question of whether Ex parte Young applies of its own 

force. I think by defining "officials" as a form of 

government and authorizing suits for appropriate relief 

against officials, I think everybody agrees that that 

authorizes suits against the officials for at least 

injunctive relief.

And then the question is, well, what does it 

accomplish to also authorize suits against States? And 

I think the obvious answer is it authorizes a damages 

claim against the State. And even in light of Barnes, 

the State seems to acknowledge that damages are 

appropriate relief against local governments under this 

statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I can conceive of a 

case where -- where the State's violation of RLUIPA 

consists of a State statute that simply deprives the 

individual of his rights under RLUIPA.

 What State official would you -- would you 

sue? It seems to me you couldn't sue the State 

legislature, so it would make sense to have an 

injunction against the State.

 MR. RUSSELL: I think it's common in that 

circumstance to sue the State attorney general for Ex 

parte Young relief, for example, if you have a 

constitutional claim against the statute, as may very 

well have happened in the California case, or the 

governor, I guess. So I don't think that naming -­

having a State as a defendant is necessary for that 

purpose here.

 In addition, as I mentioned before, I think 

even the State acknowledges that damages are appropriate

relief against local governments, but Congress made 

clear that when it intended the identity of a party to 

result in a dramatically different scope of relief, it 

did so expressly, and you can see that in the U.S. 

enforcement provision. There, Congress specially 

authorized suits by the United States and had its own 

remedial provision which provides only for declaratory 

and injunctive relief.

 And that shows both that Congress didn't 

expect courts to simply figure out that different kinds 

of defendants would be subject to different appropriate 

relief, but also -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it argued that a 

possible purpose of that was to make it clear that the 

Federal Government couldn't sue a State to recover money 

that had been given to it?

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, the fact -- I would say 

two things about that. One is Congress didn't limit 

that provision to suits against States. It's anybody 

who gets sued by the United States is limited to 

equitable injunctive relief.

 And that's, again, an example of Congress 

treating States the same as everybody else. Whether 

they are sued by the United States or sued by a private 

party, it is the same relief. It's the same remedial

provision and we think that suggests the same relief.

 That provision also kind of -- the language 

of that provision, "injunctive or declaratory relief," 

stands in pretty stark contrast to the facially broader 

phrase "appropriate relief" in the general provision.

 In addition to RLUIPA itself, I think it's 

also worth pointing out that the State had independent 

notice under section 2000(d)(7) -- this is the 

Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, where Congress 

made clear to Texas that it would be subject to suit for 

damages under any statute that -- under a section of any 

statute that prohibits discrimination by Federal funding 

recipients.

 And I think the question here boils down to 

whether RLUIPA is materially distinguishable from 

section 504, which is listed in section 2000(d)(7) as an 

example of a statute prohibiting discrimination. And 

if -- I think that means that the catch-all has to at 

least be broad enough to encompass section 504, and in 

our view, the two statutes are not distinguishable. 

Both prohibit both the kind of disparate treatment of 

similarly-situated individuals that the State 

acknowledges constitutes discrimination and requires 

accommodations in some circumstances.

effect of the issue here on persons who are in State 

institutions other than penal institutions.

 What would be -- what's the effect of the 

issue here on land use restrictions? Are there many 

cases in which issues involving land use restrictions 

are -- are raised in litigation against the State as 

opposed to a municipality?

 MR. RUSSELL: It's quite rare. I am aware 

of one pending case in Vermont where there is a 

challenge to a -- a State environmental regulation, but 

for the most part it isn't.

 But if this Court were to, you know, 

section -- the provision that we are talking about here 

applies to land use as well as to institutionalized 

persons, and one would ordinarily think that the statute 

would have the same meaning depending on context.

 I recognize that the State's basic argument 

is that the meaning changes depending on who the 

defendant is, and I suppose if you accept that it could 

also depend on -- on what provision is being applied. 

But that's not normally how statutes work.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the answer to 

Justice Alito's question is that in the land use area, 

zoning for example, those are mostly cases against 

municipalities or counties?

MR. RUSSELL: That is correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The government is going to 

tell us that the standard for waiver with respect to the 

Federal Government is different from the standard with 

respect to the State. Do you -- I think that's what 

they are going to tell us. Do you agree with that?

 MR. RUSSELL: No. I actually don't 

understand them to be making that argument, either. But 

I know for sure that that's not our position. And the 

Court's decision in Barnes I think, for example, is 

entirely consistent with the Court's recent decisions, 

including for example in Richlin, where it's made clear 

that when you are considering the scope of waiver of 

sovereign immunity, you engage in ordinary statutory 

interpretation and then the sovereign is respected. If 

at the end of that interpretation the statute remains 

unclear, you know, certainly the sovereign wins. But -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that 

the States are in need of special protection. With -­

with the Congress, if it's a Federal immunity, the 

Congress can always -- always change its law.

 The Respondent in this case agrees that when 

it accepts Federal funds for its correctional system it 

voluntarily waives its sovereign immunity to private 

suits in Federal court to enforce RLUIPA, and it is

Franklin and Barnes that that voluntary waiver

encompasses a waiver to suits for money damages.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose Congress passes a 

statute that creates a private right of action against 

both the Federal Government and against the States and 

in both instances authorizes all appropriate relief. 

Are damages available in the action against the Federal 

Government as well as the State government?

 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, it would depend on 

the context to answer both questions.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, the State -- the State 

provision is a Spending Clause provision.

yes as to the States. This Court has been clear in 

cases such as Franklin and Barnes that in the Spending 

Clause context, unless Congress indicates an intent to 

rebut the presumption somehow -­

expected, but I find that very difficult to accept. If 

"all appropriate relief" includes damages as against the 

State that accepts Federal money, then you know, what's 

good for the State should be good for the Federal 

Government.

 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I would say two 

things. First, in both cases what you want is a clear 

statement of an intent to waive the sovereign's 

immunity, either by the Federal Government or the State 

government. And also that it's important to keep in 

mind that in cases such as Franklin and Barnes, this 

Court was construing statutes that did not say anything 

about what remedies were appropriate, didn't mention 

remedies whatsoever.

 And so we don't rely so much on RLUIPA's use 

of the phrase "appropriate relief" as we do on the 

Spending Clause context.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But those cases did not 

involve States, right?

 MS. HARRINGTON: Those cases did not involve 

States, that's true. But -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I think that the -­

the core question here is the State -- and Justice Alito 

just posed it: the State is being treated with less 

dignity than the Federal Government, because your

position is that the Federal Government is shielded by 

its sovereign immunity, and you say the State is not.

 MS. HARRINGTON: On the contrary, as to the 

dignity point, Your Honor, if -- the State voluntarily 

waives its immunity when it accepts Federal funds that 

clearly condition the acceptance of the funds on the 

waiver of its immunity. The State in this case doesn't 

contest that it has waived its sovereign immunity 

voluntarily to some universe of suits to enforce RLUIPA.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we are talking about 

general principles of interpretation and the proposition 

that we are suggesting is that the State surely should 

be entitled to the same dignity, the same protection 

against suits as the Federal Government, and you suggest 

just the opposite.

 MS. HARRINGTON: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it seems to me that's 

contrary to standard principles of the Federal -- of 

protecting the Federal balance.

 MS. HARRINGTON: If you were construing a 

State statute that voluntarily waived its own immunity, 

then you might -- we might say the use of appropriate 

relief in that statute should be construed the same as 

the use of appropriate relief in RFRA. But in this case 

you are not talking about a State's waiver of its

immunity through its -- through statutory language. The 

Court said in College Savings Bank that when a -- when a 

State takes Federal funds that are conditioned on a 

waiver of immunity, it is the act of accepting the funds 

that is the waiver and it waives its immunity to suits 

to the extent that it has noticed that it is doing so.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it's -- but it's only 

because they accept the funds at all that the Spending 

-- that the Spending Clause is even operative.

 MS. HARRINGTON: That's right. But again, 

it's -- it's the act of accepting the funds that are 

clearly conditioned that constitutes the waiver. So 

that the waiver -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the waiver -- I mean, 

on the State side they can say it says "appropriate 

relief." All right; we accept that we are going to be 

vulnerable to an injunction suit. But we're the State 

and it's our treasury, and it is not appropriate relief. 

We didn't waive it. It's not -- doesn't say in the 

Spending Clause legislation that we open up our 

treasury.

 MS. HARRINGTON: But there is no basis in 

either the Eleventh Amendment or the statutory 

provisions in RLUIPA for distinguishing relief of an 

injunctive nature from relief in damages against the

State. The Eleventh Amendment talks about suits in law 

and in equity, and there is nothing in RLUIPA that would 

give the States notice that they are waiving their 

immunity to suits for injunctive relief, but not give 

them notice that they are waiving their immunity to 

suits for money damages. This Court -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: The word "appropriate" -­

the word "appropriate" would -- would suggest that to 

me. If -- if I'm a State attorney general, and I -- I 

know that the rule is sovereign immunity and -- and 

especially with regard to raids on the State treasury, I 

think it would be at least plausible that I would -- I 

would read "appropriate relief" not to include monetary 

relief.

 And we have said -- the language from our 

cases -- Lane says a waiver of sovereign immunity must 

be unequivocally expressed in the statutory text and 

will be strictly construed in terms of its scope in 

favor of the sovereign. That's -- that's a high test.

 MS. HARRINGTON: But even -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and although I might 

sit down and come out with a conclusion after intensive 

study that yes, maybe the best reading of this statute 

is that it allows money damages, I find it hard to say 

that it is unequivocally expressed in the statutory

text.

 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, two things if I 

could, Your Honor. In Lane v. Pena, the question before 

the Court was it wasn't -- it was outside the Spending 

Clause context, because the question was whether section 

504 of the Rehabilitation Act applied to the Federal 

Government, and when the Federal Government applies, 

even in the Spending Clause context, conditions on 

itself there is no contract-like relationship. But the 

second thing this Court said in Barnes -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you deny that it has 

to be unequivocal?

 MS. HARRINGTON: It has to be unequivocal, 

but -- but the context in which you are construing 

whether -- whether the sovereign is expressing its 

intent to waive its immunity is different when you are 

talking about the Federal Government applying 

obligations on itself than when you are talking about 

the Federal Government offering money to a State in -­

in exchange for its agreeing to comply with -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that has nothing to 

do with whether the language is clear or not to 

constitute a waiver. There is no principle of law that 

you are articulating that says it -- it has to be -­

this is not clear enough for the Federal Government, but

it is clear enough for the State. "Appropriate relief" 

either has a meaning or it doesn't.

 MS. HARRINGTON: Right. And again, we are 

not relying so much on the use of the phrase 

"appropriate relief" in the statute. What that -- the 

work that does is it affirms that the background 

presumption of the Bell v. Hood cases applies to proper 

defendants under RLUIPA, which include State 

governments.

 But as this Court said in Barnes, when a -­

when a recipient of Federal funds takes the funds, it is 

on notice that it is going to be subject not only to the 

remedies explicitly provided in the text of the relevant 

legislation, but also to remedies that are traditionally 

available in suits for breach of contract, and those 

include compensatory damages and injunctive relief.

 Now the State would have this Court turn 

that presumption, in terms of traditional contract 

rules, on its head by saying that this -- that this 

Court should hold that the State presumptively waived 

its immunity to suits for injunctive relief but not for 

damages.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you say about -- I 

think I read in one of these briefs that what I think is 

the most relevant similar statute, RFRA, has been held

not to encompass the same word -- not to encompass the 

monetary relief, and also there was some legislative 

history where people testified and told Congress at the 

time that the word "appropriate" won't encompass 

monetary relief. Am I remembering that correctly?

 MS. HARRINGTON: Well, I would give you the 

same answer I just gave, which is that we are not 

pointing so much to the use of the -- using the phrase 

"appropriate relief" in the statute as we are to the 

Spending Clause context. And this Court has held that 

when there is these conditions placed on Federal funds, 

the recipient of the funds understands when it takes the 

money that when it intentionally violates the conditions 

to which it has agreed it will be subject to suit for 

money damages.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you're 

bracketing the State with counties and municipalities. 

It really comes down to a question -- who decides 

whether the state fisc is touched. And why isn't it 

most appropriate for this Court to say, Congress can 

call it either way, but our rule is, Congress, if you 

want to reach the State treasury, you have to say so 

explicitly. And then there is no doubt when the State 

enters a contract that it's going to be subject to money 

damages as well as injunctive relief.

MS. HARRINGTON: Well, this Court has 

consistently applied a clear notice requirement to 

conditions that Congress places on Federal funds. That 

clear notice requirement arose out of cases like 

Pennhurst and South Dakota v. Dole, in which there were 

State recipients of Federal funds. And the Court said 

that the validity of Congress's constitutional action in 

exercising its Spending Clause authority depends on it 

giving the recipients of the funds clear notice of the 

conditions that they are agreeing to because of the 

contract-like nature of Spending Clause legislation.

 Now, that same rule was applied in Franklin 

and Gebser and Davis and Dole, even though the 

defendants in those cases were not sovereigns. It's 

still the same notice requirement and there is no reason 

to think that a county government would be able to 

understand, would be on notice that it would be subject 

to compensatory damages suits, and a State government 

would not. To be sure, the State government has more to 

give up. It might be a harder choice for the State 

about whether to take the money or not. But the choice 

is the State's, and when it says yes, I'm going to take 

this money, it agrees to the conditions that are 

attached to the money.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES C. HO

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. HO: The phrase "appropriate relief" is 

a textbook example of ambiguity, not unmistakable 

clarity. And that should end the inquiry.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If it is, why is 

injunctive relief included at all? Meaning, what you 

seem to be saying to me is that no relief should be 

appropriate, because no relief is clear whether it's 

injunctive relief or damages?

 MR. HO: We agree with the U.S.'s reading of 

RFRA. The same should attach here. There is an express 

cause of action. So that cause of action has to do 

something and we are applying to that express cause of 

action the narrowest reading, which is -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Some would say that 

injunctive relief attaches more to the public FISC then 

compensatory relief. Because future conduct or change 

of conduct can have an enormous intrusion on the public 

FISC, so why do we draw the line between saying one is 

more intrusive than the other?

 MR. HO: Two answers, Your Honor. The 

traditional line drawing that you see in sovereign

immunity is injunctive relief. Any prospective relief 

is less intrusive on sovereign immunity than any form of 

retrospective relief, damages and that sort of thing. 

But especially true in this context, because when you 

talk about the Spending Clause, we can walk away from 

injunctive relief, from an injunction at any time. We 

can simply stop receiving the funds and stop accepting 

the funds and the injunction evaporates, but we can't 

walk away from a damage remedy. So we are construing 

the express cause of action in RLUIPA, like in RFRA, to 

do the judicial minimum. Which is that judicial relief 

which requires states to do what we are already required 

to do, which is to comply with the substantial burden 

mandatory under RLUIPA. So the fact that appropriate 

relief is essentially inherently ambiguous should end 

the analysis, because after all, the Court is required 

unmistakably clear text and rejected merely permissible 

inferences for two reasons, to ensure both careful, 

robust deliberation by Congress before disturbing the 

federal state balance of power, as well as to ensure 

clear notice.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I was looking at the cases 

the best I can at the moment. I think you might say 

that there are a lot of cases which interpret the word 

"appropriate relief" to include monetary relief. And

then there is some that don't. And to get a rule out of 

them, you would have to say, well, they are looking to 

context. And in context it sometimes is clear, 

sometimes occasionally not. But here, isn't this and 

maybe this was asked, but I want your answer. The 

context here, the words appropriate relief, govern both 

the prison situation and the land use situation, don't 

they? You are given an action when the government 

through a general land use regulation infringes 

somebody's right to build, for example. Now, wouldn't 

that kind of interference with the use of property quite 

often and normally require some kind of monetary 

compensation? This isn't just the odd thing in a 

prison, where it's talking about it might be called 

building a religious building or building some kind of 

parking, all kinds of things that have monetary 

compensation. Do you see my question?

 MR. HO: I think I do, Your Honor. First of 

all, we certainly agree that your premise, which is that 

context matters, the Court has said specifically 

appropriate relief can enlarge or contract, it could be 

mean monetary or it could mean not monetary, so it does 

depend on context. I confess that your question is 

interesting, we are obviously focused on section 3.

same word that governs both?

 MR. HO: It is the same word.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If it's the same word that 

governs both and if land cases very often involve claims 

for money, I would think that would cut against you. 

But that's why I ask. I want to get your response.

 MR. HO: Well, we are still looking for 

express language in the text.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But there are loads of 

cases that have nothing more than appropriate relief and 

in those cases context makes it clear. The only one 

really I thought strongly -- your strongest case seems 

to me to be RFRA.

 MR. HO: RFRA certainly is the direct 

context from which the words appropriate relief in this 

statute are drawn. And RFRA, of course, is land use, 

it's prisons, it's anything, RFRA applies to the federal 

government or any activity under the sun.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh.

 MR. HO: So for that reason alone, I think 

we might resist the notion that the specific uses of 

appropriate relief in RLUIPA would somehow provide any 

sort of change or certainly any expectation that we 

would have or that Congress would have, for that matter, 

that the words appropriate relief would take on a new

meaning just because it's land use.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, so often, what I'm 

thinking of, a church wands to build, and they can't 

because of a land restriction. And it turns out that 

that land restriction violates this statute. And in the 

meantime they have had to rent buildings, they have had 

to maybe build somewhere else and they have had to do 

all kinds of things that cost money. And that's why I 

would think in that context money would be a natural 

thing.

 MR. HO: I'm not sure though -­

JUSTICE BREYER: To fulfill appropriateness.

 MR. HO: I'm actually not sure that that 

would be true even in that context. Certainly anybody 

might want money, but when it comes to what Congress has 

indicated and what states would expect, I would imagine 

that the federal government's biggest interest is in 

making sure that states and other recipients use the 

money for what it's supposed to be for, comply with the 

substantial burden mandate. And a local government is 

not doing so with regard to a church, then they should 

be enjoined so that they would be required to comply 

with it. If anything, damages might exacerbate the 

problem just in the sense that we are now taking federal 

money and applying damages to it.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought a local 

government would be subject to damages. We are talking 

about the state.

 MR. HO: We are talking about the state, 

Your Honor. To be clear, we do not actually concede 

that damages would even be available against a local 

government. Our point here is that simply it doesn't 

matter for us, because we obviously are treated very 

differently from local governments. I think they have, 

both the Petitioner and U.S. have indicated that the 

statute should treat state and locals the same way. The 

problem with that is the Constitution obviously treats 

states and locals very differently. The Constitution 

treats the state and federal government in the same way, 

in that both enjoy sovereign immunity and included in 

that are the principles of sovereign immunity, the need 

for specific waiver, not just a clear waiver, but 

specific as to the scope of the waiver, and specific as 

to the remedies.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now we have three 

distinctions. With respect to land use discrimination, 

the Rehab Act would presumably apply. So the Rehab Act 

says compensatory damages are permissible for that kind 

of discriminatory claim, so now we have compensatory 

damages for that. We have, potentially, compensatory

damages for local governments, but not for State or 

Federal level.

 We are chopping up the statute at each 

stage, correct? We are treating different defendants 

differently and different claims differently with 

respect to the relief that's permissible?

 MR. HO: That would not be our submission, 

Your Honor. If we are talking about the 2000d(7) 

language, all that 2000(d)(7) says if you are a 

provision prohibiting discrimination, then you get the 

same remedies against a State that you would get against 

any other nonsovereign defendant. And if we were 

representing the City of Austin, we actually would 

argue -- we think we have a good argument -- that 

damages would not be available even against the City of 

Austin. Our point here is simply that -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you explain why?

 MR. HO: Sure. I think if I were the City 

of Austin, I would make three arguments. One, the words 

"appropriate relief" are in the statute. I think 

they -- the other one wants to read this as surplusage. 

We would think that the words "appropriate relief" 

should do something, and we note that there were several 

justices who dissented in West v. Gibson, noting that 

the words "appropriate relief" seemed to indicate

equitable discretion, or discretion, and therefore 

equitable relief.

 In addition, we will note that the words 

"appropriate relief" in (4)(A) -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But equity permits money 

as well. Equity permits money as well.

 MR. HO: In some limited formats, but it 

wouldn't be compensatory damages in the sense that we 

are talking about in this case.

 An additional indication would be the fact 

that the words "appropriate relief" aren't just attached 

to the claim. It's attached to both claim or defense. 

And of course it makes no sense to say that you can get 

money damages by asserting RLUIPA as a defense.

 So for all those reasons, the City of Austin 

might actually have a good case that damages aren't 

available even against them. Of course, it doesn't 

matter for our case, because the whole point is if the 

City of Austin were to lose due to Barnes and Franklin, 

what we know for sure here is that Barnes and Franklin 

have nothing, nothing whatsoever, to do with the States.

 If I may, I would like to spend a little bit 

of time on that issue.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Okay.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I'm -- this one

recalibrate that decision.

 Their core argument is that we should just 

extend Franklin and Barnes to States. The fatal flaw 

with that argument is that the very principle on which 

Franklin and Barnes apply -- are premised, that 

principle does not apply to sovereigns. When Congress 

passes a cause of action and is silent or ambiguous with 

respect to the remedies, there is a traditional 

presumption that we apply. Non-sovereigns now expect to 

be subject to any possible remedy under the sun.

 Precisely the opposite rule applies to 

sovereigns. We know that for sure as a matter of 

precedent in Lane, which rejected Franklin as applied to 

a sovereign. We also know this as a more fundamental 

basic principle of sovereign immunity, because when it 

comes to sovereigns, we have to have not only a clear 

waiver, but also a waiver that is specific to the remedy 

that is being sought.

 These two rules can't be reconciled. You 

either can apply the traditional presumption of all 

remedies, or you apply the other rule that sovereigns 

benefit from.

 Petitioner claims that maybe a special rule 

should apply that is unique to the Spending Clause, that 

maybe that's a way to get around the sovereign immunity

problem, but we submit that fundamentally misreads 

Franklin and Barnes, because what's doing the work in 

Franklin and Barnes isn't the Spending Clause. It's 

actually quite the opposite. The Spending Clause is 

cutting back against the traditional presumption.

 In Franklin -- I will take each case in 

turn. In Franklin, you see pages and pages of analysis 

in section 2 of the opinion, where there is exhaustive 

research about Bell v. Hood and the traditional 

presumptions that the Court has applied for decades 

under any thought of Federal power.

 The Spending Clause makes an appearance in 

Franklin only at the very end in section 4, invoked by 

the defense as a potential reason not to apply the 

traditional presumption. The court, you know, gets past 

that on the grounds that the traditional presumption is 

so strong that it does provide the clarity for 

non-sovereigns. It doesn't indisputably apply to 

non-sovereigns; why not apply it under the Spending 

Clause as well?

 The point, though, is it's not the Spending 

Clause that does the work. It is -- it is the 

traditional presumption. That has even more dramatic 

force in Barnes v. Gorman. Mr. Gorman would have had a 

$1.2 million punitive damage award that he would have

been entitled to, except for the fact that this was a 

Spending Clause case, and that's precisely why he lost 

that punitive damage award.

 So put simply, yes, it could be that under 

Barnes and Franklin, remedies would be clear enough in 

that one context. The problem is it's not clear enough 

in this context, because sovereigns present a completely 

different constitutional context.

 I want to address very quickly Justice 

Sotomayor's question about Ex parte Young. I think you 

were exactly right that Ex parte -- that our reading 

isn't in any way redundant with Ex parte Young, but I 

want to note an additional reason why we are not 

redundant.

 We need to confirm, Congress needed to 

confirm, that there was in fact a privately enforceable 

right, and that's why our reading in no way renders the 

Ex parte Young concept redundant.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do with the 

practical problem that's been brought up that if a State 

is sued, it can release the prisoner, it can transfer 

the prisoner, and then no relief is appropriate? That 

the only way that the State is going to take its 

obligation seriously is if it's exposed to compensatory 

damages?

MR. HO: If a prisoner is transferred, 

released, or the State simply changes its mind and gives 

up and provides the accommodation, in all those 

situations, the prisoner is no longer suffering from the 

complaint of condition. That's why this Court's 

mootness doctrines would apply.

 Put another way, mootness is really just 

another word for settlement, and we would think that 

settlement, the State essentially capitulating and 

saying: Our bad, we should have complied, we should 

have provided the accommodation, that actually 

vindicates the purpose of RLUIPA, and indeed, it avoids 

the need for costly litigation to do so.

 I want to mention briefly the U.S. -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What's the inducement to 

do it more quickly rather than to delay, to remedy the 

wrong faster rather than to delay?

 MR. HO: The reason to do it?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Uh-huh.

 MR. HO: Simply to avoid litigation. I 

mean, the way this works practically on the ground, 

prisons obviously have a lot to deal with, a lot of 

security concerns. They set general policies. They may 

not be aware that their policy might have an application 

for a certain individual of a particular faith. If

that's brought to their attention and -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's an ideal world, 

that they'll respond, but there is an allegation that 

some prisons wait until the eve of the trial after 

onerous discovery on the plaintiff and after enormous 

harm to plaintiffs, physical and otherwise, before they 

capitulate. So what's the inducement?

 MR. HO: Well, the inducement is to -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: To move faster.

 MR. HO: States are -- States are suffering 

the litigation costs as well. We are not in the 

business to litigate just because we want to. We have 

plenty of other suits to deal with.

 This very case, I think, is a good example. 

Once the prisoner -- once Mr. Sossamon agreed with 

respect to the salt restriction policy, we immediately 

abandoned that policy, before litigation was even filed.

 With respect to the U.S. cause of action 

provision, there was an argument that appropriate relief 

has to mean damages, because otherwise just take that 

declaratory or injunctive relief language and put it 

into the private cause of action. The reason that 

argument doesn't work is because these are two 

fundamentally different provisions.

 There is (4)(F) of RFRA, which is the U.S.

cause of action, and there was (4)(A) of -- I'm sorry, 

of RLUIPA -- and there is (4)(A) of RLUIPA, which is not 

just a private cause of action, but also a defense. So 

again, if you can imagine sticking in the words 

"declaratory and injunctive relief" and putting it right 

into (4)(A), it doesn't work. It doesn't make any 

sense, because what person asserting a defense would 

seek an injunctive relief? If you take what's -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Let me ask -- get this 

information from you. As I understand it, there are 

some cases that find the words "appropriate relief" in a 

statute to include damages and there's some that don't. 

Let's look at the ones that don't.

 There is some where it's pretty hard to do 

it because it's in a heading called "injunction," and 

that's obvious. But there are only two statutes, 

really, where the courts have ever held in significant 

numbers that the word "appropriate relief" does not 

include money damages. One is the IDEA, the 

Disabilities Act, and the other is RFRA.

 Is there anything else that you've come 

across?

 MR. HO: Those are two great examples.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but are there any 

others? I mean, I just want to get down on a piece of

paper what I have to look at.

 MR. HO: Sure. I think there are two -- two 

great examples. I would note -­

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So you don't 

have any others, I'm judging from your hesitation.

 MR. HO: No, no -- I would actually -- I 

would note there are two other cases -­

JUSTICE BREYER: What?

 MR. HO: -- that I would refer you to, and 

of course discussed in the briefs. West v. Gibson which 

talks about how the words appropriate relief, remedies 

in that context, by definition have no fixed meaning; 

they can't possibly have fixed meaning. So it has to 

enlarge or contract. And prior to 1991 -- prior to 1991 

amendment at issue in that case -- the Court would 

unanimously agreed that appropriate relief would not 

have included money damages.

 Ruckelshaus provides similar guidance, in 

that I think the phrase was, there was no possible -- no 

comprehensible or principled meaning to the phrase 

"appropriate" as attached to a remedy.

 I will briefly touch on the 2000d-7 issue 

unless there are questions about that. Assuming the 

issue is even preserved for this Court's consideration, 

2000d-7 doesn't allow relief, either. I think there are

a lot of reasons why that would be so, but I think the 

simplest is simply to acknowledge the difference between 

section 2 of RLUIPA and section 3.

 Section 2 of RLUIPA is much like the four 

provisions expressly enumerated in 2000d-7, in that all 

of them have the word discrimination and more 

importantly turn on the concept of discrimination. A 

discrimination is an element of a cause of action under 

section 2, or under any of the four provisions 

enumerated.

 By contrast section 3 is not. You can have 

discrimination as -- as part of your fact background if 

you want but it will have nothing whatsoever to do with 

whether have you a valid section 3 claim or not.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You -- you have already 

addressed this but I think it's their -- the position of 

your friend on the other side of the case is that with 

the Spending Clause you have a contract. The State has 

some extra protection, and therefore we need not be 

quite so strict in -- in construing waivers -- waivers 

of immunity, because you have the contract.

 Can you comment on that argument? And -­

and you might want to say that the Spending Clause is 

potentially so sweeping that the State should have 

special protection and we should be particularly careful

about the clear statement rule.

 Or do you think the clear statement rule 

applies with equal force whether it's a Spending Clause 

or a direct regulation under say, the Fourteenth 

Amendment?

 MR. HO: I'll try to take each of those 

points in turn.

 We don't see anything in the law that 

suggests that sometimes there is a clear statement rule 

and sometimes there is a super-duper clear statement 

rule. I think there has been some suggestion -- or 

maybe there has not been any more; I'm not sure; I read 

the briefs the same way, I think the same way that the 

Justices did. But they seem not to be arguing that any 

more.

 So it should be the same standard. I -- I 

certainly acknowledge that when it comes to the Spending 

Clause as you wrote in your dissent in Davis v. Monroe, 

that the Spending Clause if anything does raise special 

constitutional considerations as a general matter, 

inasmuch as the Spending Clause could be used to impose 

Federal restrictions on States that they could never 

dream of under Article I otherwise. RLUIPA of course is 

a prime example of that.

 But at the end of the day, the Spending

Clause is not doing any work with regard to providing an 

assumption or presumption of remedies. Again, it's 

exactly precisely the opposite. Franklin and Barnes 

both articulate that it's the traditional presumption 

that applies to any exercise of Federal power. That 

traditional presumption is what's doing the work. The 

Spending Clause if anything is a cut back. So the 

notion that just invoking the Spending Clause suddenly 

puts States on this fabulously clear notice, I think 

just does not work.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. RUSSELL: Thank you.

 Nearly every argument the state made here 

today could have been made by the local governments in 

Barnes. Ranging from the complaint that the language 

like appropriate relief is too unclear, to the assertion 

that they were not on notice, that by accepting federal 

funds they were subjecting themselves to suits. And

that's because the local government, like any other 

state, had the same right to the same clear statement 

rule. Unless this Court is, in fact, going to create a 

proliferation or hierarchy of clear statement rules, the 

Pennhurst rule that applies in the Spending Clause 

context of local governments applies in exactly the same 

way to a state government under the Eleventh Amendment 

and Barnes' Court construed the express private right of 

action under section 504, which incorporated by 

reference the remedies available under Title XI, which 

this Court construed to authorize appropriate relief. 

Exactly the same remedy that RLUIPA authorizes. And so 

the state for the first time today has suggested that 

the city of Austin is not bound by Barnes. I don't see 

how they can reach that conclusion. Barnes quite 

clearly says that the local government is subject to -­

and is on notice that it has clear, there is a clear 

statement in every Spending Clause statute that they are 

subject to a damages remedy so long as they accept the 

funds because of the contractual nature of the 

obligation. That applies.

Barnes?

compensatory damages contested in Barnes?

 MR. RUSSELL: No. The question in Barnes is 

punitive.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just punitive. And there 

is a lot of discussion, the assumption that they were 

liable for compensatory, but it really wasn't litigated, 

was it?

 MR. RUSSELL: Well, the legal principle this 

Court adopted to resolve that issue was one that, I take 

it, was not just a principle for that case, but that in 

general, funding recipients are on notice that they are 

subject to contract remedies and unless this Court is 

going to back away from that as a general matter, unless 

the Court is going to say that Pennhurst applies 

differently in the Spending Clause context than it does 

in the sovereign immunity context, I don't see how you 

can come to a different result in this case.

 Justice Breyer, with respect to RFRA, as far 

as I know, there is only one court of appeals case that 

says the United States is not subject to suits and that 

was decided six years after RLUIPA was enacted. With 

respect to the IDEA, there are a handful of lower courts 

decisions that say damages are unavailable. Those -­

they give reasons that are specific to the IDEA and the 

fact that that remedial provision is part of the due

process hearing process there. In general, damages are 

the quintessential appropriate relief for violations of 

civil rights, and there is no reason to think that 

Congress was creating in RLUIPA a second class civil 

right that wasn't deserving of a remedy that Congress 

has provided even against states in every other context. 

With respect to the state's belief that the Eleventh 

Amendment somehow prefers injunctions over damages 

remedies, as counsel for the United States pointed out, 

the Eleventh Amendment is no basis for that. It treats 

injunctions and damages as equally offensive to state 

sovereignty, and in fact, particularly in RLUIPA, where 

damages are often capped significantly by the PLRA, the 

concern really ought to be on the states by injunctive 

relief, which will frequently have a much more 

significant effect on the public FISC than a small 

damages award.

 And finally with the state's argument that 

the words appropriate relief are too inherently 

ambiguous to meet any clear statement. Well, this Court 

rejected that kind of argument in West where it 

construed appropriate remedy to encompass a damages 

remedy by engaging an ordinary statutory interpretation, 

which is entirely appropriate in this context. This 

Court has repeatedly in cases like Ruckelshaus, for
