CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Georgia versus Randolph. 

MS. SMITH: Mr. --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Smith. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAULA K. SMITH 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MS. SMITH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The question presented in this case is 

whether one occupant can give law enforcement valid 

consent to search the common areas of a premises 

shared with another, even though another occupant is 

present and objects to the search. The State of 

Georgia submits that the answer to this case is a 

resounding yes. It is reasonable to recognize that a 

person who satisfies Matlock's definition of common 

authority -- that is, a definition that is not based 

upon property-law concepts, but one who has mutual use 

of property by virtue of having joint access or 

control for most purposes -- can give consent for a 

search of that premises, in his or her own right. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do we look to what is 

socially acceptable? Is there some language to that

effect in some of our cases? 

MS. SMITH: There has been some of that in 

some of the prior cases, Your Honor, that you do look 

to social norms. You've also said --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you think it is the 

norm that, if there are co-inhabitants of a house or 

apartment, that it's okay to let a stranger in, 

against the express wishes of your spouse or co-

inhabitant? 

MS. SMITH: I think that is --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: You think that's socially 

acceptable? 

MS. SMITH: I think it is -- I think it is 

common, Your Honor. As much as one would like to 

think --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it might be common, 

but I'm not sure that's an acceptable kind of 

performance. 

MS. SMITH: Well, I think, Your Honor, we 

have what we have called either adduced expectation of 

privacy or a limited expectation of privacy or what we 

called a shared expectation of privacy, by making the 

decision, long before police appear at the door, to 

share this premises with someone. And by --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: What --

MS. SMITH: I don't think that, even as --

in -- one could ensure that the spouse would honor the 

other person's wishes. I think this case is here to 

give some substance to the recognition in Matlock of 

the ability of the cotenant to consent, in his or her 

own right. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about the extent of 

the search? Can the wife say, "It's okay for you to 

come in, and you can look in my husband's top drawer"? 

MS. SMITH: I think, Your Honor, that would 

be a question of fact, under the circumstances, to see 

whether the husband has exhibited some exclusive use 

of that drawer or whether the facts would demonstrate 

that she puts socks in there for him, she puts --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, how does the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- how does the policeman

policeman supposed to know that? 

MS. SMITH: Well, I think -- looking -- we 

measure what is reasonable on the part of the police 

by looking to what they know. And Rodriguez made very 

clear, one does -- a policeman doesn't simply accept 

every invitation to enter. If there's some ambiguity 

or some uncertainty, the policeman has a duty to 

inquire. And, I think, looking into the facts of this 

particular case is a good example. You have police 

who were called to the marital home of Mr. and Mrs. 

Randolph. It arose out of a domestic dispute, because 

Mr. Randolph had absconded with the couple's child. 

The officer -- this was a small town -- the officer 

knew Mr. Randolph, because Mr. Randolph was a local 

attorney. The officer knew that Ms. -- who the wife 

was. And he knew this was the couple's home. When he 

got there, in talking with the wife -- Mr. Randolph 

was off with the child, hasn't returned to the 

residence -- he learned that they had been having some 

problems, but, in looking at the two conversations 

that ensued, the policeman learned that, despite the 

problems, she was back, she was living there. There 

was no separation. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought she said she 

came to collect her belongings. That didn't sound

like she's intending to stay very long. 

MS. SMITH: She did not -- she did not relay 

that to the officer. That came from Mr. Randolph, in 

his testimony at the suppression hearing. All --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't it relevant 

what the status of the person is? Someone might not 

know -- the police might not know that someone on the 

premises is a temporary visitor. 

MS. SMITH: Well, Your Honor -- and I think 

that, looking at the tenor of the conversations, that 

is exactly what this officer ascertained. He knew 

that she was there, they had been living there, she 

was back, she had been on a visit. She did not tell 

him they were separated. She did not tell him she was 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: She called --

MS. SMITH: -- only there --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the police, didn't 

she? She called the police to come. 

MS. SMITH: She called the police. And what 

we have, more importantly, is a factfinding by the 

trial court that she, in fact, had common authority to 

give consent to search. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: And is that a -- is there 

any issue about that here?

 MS. SMITH: No, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, I thought 

the issue was whether his statement, in effect, vetoed 

whatever -- for Fourth Amendment purposes, whatever 

permission might have been given. But, as I -- I 

understood that there was no question -- what is it? -

- under Rodriguez, at least -- of her authority, 

facially to admit the police to the places that they 

went. 

MS. SMITH: That is our position, Your 

Honor. I think there has been some question raised by 

the Respondent, in his brief, trying to challenge both 

her authority over the actual bedroom, itself, which 

is an issue that wasn't raised below. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's what I thought. 

MS. SMITH: And there had been an argument 

raised in the appellate court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we --

MS. SMITH: -- about whether she had 

abandoned the property. But the trial --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But all of this is really 

getting pretty far from what I think is really the key 

question in the case. Matlock is decided. And 

Matlock said -- it referred to the risk that a joint 

occupant undertakes, the risk of inability to control

access during one's absence. So, the scene in Matlock 

is: one occupant is there, the other is absent; and 

the one who was absent assumes the risk that the one 

who was there will exercise control. Matlock doesn't 

speak to the two people who are in disagreement 

situation. 

MS. SMITH: That is correct, Your Honor, as 

to not addressing the spectral situation. But I would 

disagree that Matlock simply only spoke to an absent 

nonconsenting defendant. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, what if we think it 

does? Because that's how I read it, too, that Matlock 

governs where one of the people is absent. And we 

have a situation that's different here. Now what rule 

do we look to? 

MS. SMITH: I think you look to whether she 

has common authority over the premises in his -- in 

her own right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Even when --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- even when the husband 

is physically present and says no? 

MS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, because, first 

of all, you said, in Rodriguez, the Constitution does

not guarantee that a search, only with the defendant's 

consent, will occur. Your Honors said that --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But, do you --

MS. SMITH: -- only a search that --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- do you --

MS. SMITH: -- is unreasonable --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- think the officers had 

sufficient grounds to get a warrant here for a search? 

MS. SMITH: They ultimately did, Your Honor, 

but that consideration of getting a warrant was also 

at play in Matlock and, I think, in Rodriguez. And 

the point is, if one has valid consent, you don't have 

to get a warrant. They --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But that's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's the --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- the issue. Is it 

valid consent when the co-owner, the husband, is there 

and says, "No, you don't"? 

MS. SMITH: Well, Your Honor, I think you --

we come back to the fact that he does not have a 

reasonable expectation of absolute or unequivocal 

control --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? I --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that depends on what we 

say. I'm, frankly, still somewhat surprised at your 

answer to Justice O'Connor, indicating that it happens 

all the time where there are two occupants, and one 

expressly says, "You can't come in," and they do 

anyway. But leaving that aside, it seems to me that 

most of the considerations that would impel a decision 

in your favor can be answered under other doctrines. 

If there's cocaine that's being used and may be 

destroyed, there's exigent circumstances. I don't see 

the necessity for the rule that you propose. 

MS. SMITH: Well, I think, Your Honor, its 

ability -- if we're going to have consent, and if 

we're going to have a third-party-consent rule, then 

this is an issue that is going to have to be resolved. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're talking about --

MS. SMITH: I'm --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- reasonable expectations, 

I suppose, here. 

MS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you assume that it -

- that it is the reasonable expectation of two people 

who have -- who are living together in -- on -- in 

common premises, that, where one of them wants 

somebody to come in, and the other one does not want

somebody to come in, the person may come in? I would 

think that the normal assumption is just the opposite, 

that, where one wants somebody excluded, that person 

will be excluded. 

MS. SMITH: Well, I think, in the Morning 

case that was cited in the brief, they realized one 

can always hope that the other will accede to one's 

wishes. But, this is the dynamics of personal 

behavior, and I think it comes from an almost 

subliminal assertion that the person who was saying no 

does, in fact, have absolute authority over --

JUSTICE SCALIA: In --

MS. SMITH: -- that shared --

JUSTICE SCALIA: In Matlock --

MS. SMITH: -- premises. And that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: In Matlock --

MS. SMITH: -- that's out of sync --

the absent person say no?

Matlock, a situation where you know that one of the

parties didn't want entry. You don't know that. You 

-- there was one party there, and that party said, 

"Okay, come in." And the other party said, "Well, if 

I had been consulted, I would have said no," or 

whatever. But --

MS. SMITH: Well, in -- and even in that 

situation, Matlock, the reference to the absent 

nonconsenting defendant was in a paragraph where the 

court had talked about how it had reserved, in Amos --

the Amos case -- the question of whether a wife could 

waive her husband's rights. And then you had decided 

the Frazier case, and that was what was described as 

the nonconsenting absent codefendant in which two 

cousins had shared the use of a duffle bag, and the 

defendant had left the duffle bag with the cousin. The 

cousin and his mother gave consent for the search. 

And it simply was not that the defendant was not 

present, but this Court found there was mutual use of 

that bag that gave the cousin the authority to 

consent. And then, the Court readily rejected 

Frazier's arguments that, "Well, the cousin could only 

use one compartment of the duffle bag." And you said 

you wouldn't get into such metaphysical distinctions. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Ms. --

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- Ms. Smith, may I -- your 

time is getting short, and I want to get clear on one 

thing. As I understand it, your argument is not an 

argument that the husband, in this case, lost an 

expectation of privacy. You are not arguing that he 

has no right to object. Am I correct on that? 

MS. SMITH: I think, Your Honor, we had 

called it a --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, and let me --

MS. SMITH: -- a reduced --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If that is correct, then 

your whole argument rests on the fact that, although 

he has, and may assert, an expectation of privacy, 

that is irrelevant to the right of his wife to let 

people, including the police, come into an area which 

is under her control, as well as his. Is that it? 

MS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MS. SMITH: -- that is. And I think, 

looking at Justice Stevens' dissent in Rodriguez, 

there is that recognition of: When you make the 

decision to share premises with another, you have lost 

the expectation of exclusive or absolute control --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But your expectation --

this is what I'm trying to get at -- your expectation

is not what governs. You concede, as I understand it, 

that he still had an expectation, in the sense that he 

could assert a right of privacy, he can litigate this 

case, he has standing --

MS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- but that his expectation 

is irrelevant to the fact that the wife, in this case, 

we assume, had the right to admit them to an area 

which was under her control, as well as his. Is --

have I got it correct? 

MS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor, I think so. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MS. SMITH: I think that his -- his 

expectation is unreasonable. And we would urge the 

Court not to adopt that and enshrine that as the rule 

for fourth amendment, third-party searches. 

If there are no further questions, I'll save 

the remainder --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you would distinguish 

-- in your answer to Justice Souter -- this is -- this 

is a lawyer. One room in the house is devoted -- is 

his office. 

MS. SMITH: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Her permission wouldn't 

extend to that room, would it?

 MS. SMITH: I think it would -- it would 

have presented a much closer question of -- and 

particularly given the protection of papers and the 

fact that you may have business papers in there with 

attorney-client privilege -- I think her authority to 

consent it would have presented a closer question, 

although it would still be something to look at under 

totality of circumstances. She might have operated as 

a paralegal. She might have been his secretary. She 

might have known where he stashed his cocaine under a 

particular file. 

But that's not the question we have in this 

case. We're talking about common areas of a marital 

home over which both have equal access and control. 

And we would urge this Court to recognize that she, 

with common authority over those premises, has the 

ability to admit police and give consent to a search, 

in her own right.

 The law of consent searches is governed by a 

determination of what is reasonable for the police to 

do in a particular circumstance, and it starts from 

the premise that consent is not a disfavored species 

in the law, that cooperation with law enforcement is a 

good thing and should be encouraged. 

The right of the cotenant, in this case, to 

consent stems from her common authority, which is 

independent of his and allows her to serve valuable 

social interests, as well as interests that represent 

her own personal interest. Many of these cases arise 

not among couples who are harmonious, but among 

couples in which there is some degree of tension, and 

the spouse who consents in these situations has an 

independent interest in ensuring that she can call 

upon the protection of the law. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But we --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Go ahead. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was curious, 

though, which way that fact cut. I can see the 

argument that the closer the relationship, the more 

reasonable it is to say that the one party more or 

less recognizes that their privacy interests are held 

hostage to the views of the other. It's when you get

interests, that maybe the expectations of privacy, or 

the reasonableness of one acting as an agent of the 

other, becomes a little more strained. 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

don't think that the law in this area is founded on a 

notion of agency. It's founded on a notion of 

independent authority of each to grant access to the 

police, to cooperate with law enforcement with respect 

to premises over which authority is shared. And in a 

case like this, the wife has an independent interest 

in disassociating herself from criminal activity that 

is going on, on the premises. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But she can do that by 

advising the police, and then there's probable cause. 

Or, if the husband's there, there are probably 

exigent circumstances. 

MR. DREEBEN: Justice Kennedy, there may 

well be other bases to allow law enforcement activity 

to go on, but that presupposes that her authority to 

consent is somehow qualified: If the police could 

obtain a warrant or some other doctrine, would it 

support the search? And this Court has twice rejected 

exactly that approach to the analysis of consent 

searches.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Dreeben, does this 

authority to let someone in, over the objection of the 

cohabitant, apply only to policemen, or is it -- is it 

also the case that -- I don't know, as a matter of, 

what, property law, or whatever? -- that when two 

people have common ownership of a piece of land or a 

house or whatever, and one of them says, "I don't want 

a certain party to come on," the tie always goes to 

the other party, who says, "I do want somebody to come 

on," is that -- is there any cases that establish that 

proposition? It seems to me an odd proposition. I 

would have thought the opposite. 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, the law of property, 

Justice Scalia, to the extent that it's relevant here, 

would allow any cotenant to license his or her 

interest --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But we have not decided 

Fourth Amendment issues on the basis of the law of 

property, have we? 

MR. DREEBEN: I quite agree, Justice --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Don't we --

MR. DREEBEN: -- O'Connor. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- have to look at social 

understanding on right to privacy? And how is it that 

you can construe, in every instance, a right of a

cotenant to override the express objections of the 

other cotenant, who's there, and says no? How can you 

say that's acceptable? 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice O'Connor, I 

certainly do not think that there is any uniform 

social understanding that should drive the decision in 

this case, for two different reasons. First of all, I 

think, in many circumstances, two people who share 

property, and who disagree about whether a guest 

should be invited, will resolve it in a variety of 

different ways. Somebody might let in a commercial 

visitor, over the objection of a cotenant, or someone 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's possible, 

but you have a case here where the wife says, "Come 

in," and the husband is right there and says, "No, you 

can't." 

MR. DREEBEN: And I think that the other 

factor that the Court needs to consider in evaluating 

this is not just social expectations with respect to 

non-law-enforcement events and visitors, but this 

positive, affirmative social interest in encouraging 

cooperation with the law, which is something that she 

has the ability to do with respect to property over 

which she has common authority.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- well, you keep 

saying that, but that policy is -- can be vindicated 

by using doctrines other than consent. And you want 

us to -- I think you want us to say, I think we have 

to say, that there's a general social expectation that 

the person who wants entry overrides the person who 

doesn't. 

MR. DREEBEN: I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I also agree with 

Justice Scalia, that social expectation may be, in 

part, measured by our cases on this subject. And I 

just don't see how, if it's against the interest of an 

occupant to allow entry, that that -- that that 

interest must, necessarily, be overridden. 

MR. DREEBEN: I think that what the Court 

needs to do is look at the consent-search doctrine in 

relation to third-party consents, generally. Matlock 

makes quite clear that if the objecting -- potentially 

objecting party, the target of the search, does not 

voice an objection, then the third party has full 

authority to allow the search, even if they're --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, yes, but there's 

kind of an assumption there that if the cotenant is 

not there, sure, you'll let the tenant who is there 

call the shots.

 MR. DREEBEN: I don't think that, on the 

facts of either Matlock or Rodriguez, that would be a 

particularly logical or reasonable assumption. In 

Matlock, you're dealing with a man who was arrested 

for bank robbery in the front lawn of his house, the 

police take him to a police car, put him in a police 

car, do not ask him for consent; instead, they go back 

and they ask the woman, with whom he is living at the 

house, for consent to search. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --

MR. DREEBEN: Rodriguez is even more 

dramatic, because, in Rodriguez, the victim of a 

battery, Gail Fischer, seeks out the police and says, 

"I want you to arrest Rodriguez," and brings him to 

the -- to -- the police to the apartment, where they 

enter and arrest Rodriguez. Surely, if Rodriguez had 

been asked, or if Matlock had been asked, the 

presumption is, they would have objected. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask two questions? 

Seems to me you're -- if we're using social analogies 

in what happens, I imagine that it would make a 

difference if the person who wants to -- who was 

invited in by the wife, is larger or smaller than the 

husband.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And I think he probably

so --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- in his physical 

encounter. And the problem with your case here is, 

the police officer is always larger than the 

homeowner, and he always has the power to override any 

physical objection. So, I think that the -- the 

actual social situation will vary tremendously from 

different facts as to the fair -- and yet, we're 

looking for a rule that applies equally across the 

board --

MR. DREEBEN: Well --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- in this case. 

MR. DREEBEN: At --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And the second question I 

want you to address at the same time is, What if this 

was a suitcase that they both owned? They stopped in 

the airport. The wife says, "I don't want you to open 

it," and her husband says, "Go ahead and open it," or 

vice versa. 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Stevens, the 

second one is the easier one. The same rule applies. 

Anyone who has common authority over the suitcase

should be able to cooperate with law enforcement to 

vindicate both the social interest in cooperating with 

a law enforcement request and the interests of the 

person's who's making it. And I think that that's 

what Matlock is all about. 

Now, as for the attempt to mirror --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Matlock is the reasonable 

police -- well, go ahead. I shouldn't interrupt. 

MR. DREEBEN: The attempt to transpose 

ordinary social understandings from a myriad of 

infinitely varied settings that do not involve law 

enforcement, I submit, will not correctly allow this 

Court to calibrate what it should be doing, which is 

balancing the individual interests in privacy against 

the social interests that affirmatively encourage and 

validate the use of consent. And I think what Matlock 

does, to put this case in context, is to illustrate 

that if the police had waited until Respondent had 

left his house to go to work, or to go to court, or to 

do anything else, or if he had stayed there and gone 

to sleep at night, then Matlock tells us that she 

would have full authority to allow the police into the 

house to conduct a search of common areas. And, for 

this Court to announce a rule that says, no, when the 

person is there on the scene and vocalizes an

objection, which we can reasonably presume that he 

would have if he was given the opportunity to voice 

it, would mean that police simply have an incentive to 

find a different way to accomplish the same end. And 

I would submit that that does not give adequate --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The "different way," of 

course, would be to get a warrant. 

MR. DREEBEN: An option would be to get a 

warrant in cases where the police do have probable 

cause, but, as this Court recognized in Schneckloth 

versus Bustamonte, the courts -- the officers will not 

always have probable cause. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would they, on -- in --

on these facts -- I thought not, but perhaps I was 

wrong -- the -- when the police come to the house, 

they don't suspect anything about cocaine. Wife then 

accuses husband of being a cocaine user. So, that's 

the first information the police have. Could they get 

a warrant, just on her say-so? In fact, they got the 

straw that had the cocaine residue on it. They went 

to the magistrate with that straw, and he gave them a 

warrant. But if they had nothing but the wife's 

accusation, "He -- he's a cocaine user," would that 

amount to probable cause? 

MR. DREEBEN: I think it clearly would,

Justice Ginsburg. And the facts in this --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: It would, or would not? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: It would? 

MR. DREEBEN: It would amount to probable 

cause if the wife, who has -- she's in a position 

where she would know what's going on in the house, 

what kind of activity is going on in the house, she is 

a presumptively reliable citizen providing information 

to the police, and the fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA: All she said is, "He's a 

cocaine user." Does that -- does that -- does that 

give probable cause to believe that there are -- you 

know, that there's contraband on the premises or --

MR. DREEBEN: Well, that's not all she said, 

Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. 

MR. DREEBEN: What she said was that there 

were items of drug evidence --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MR. DREEBEN: -- in the house. And if you 

look at the warrant that the officers obtained, it 

more clearly elaborates that she said there were drugs 

and paraphernalia. But, for the Court's purposes, 

this case is virtually identical to Illinois versus 

McArthur with respect to the probable cause. You have

a wife and a husband who are in a domestic dispute, 

and the wife comes out, in Illinois versus McArthur, 

and tells the officers, you know, "He's got drugs 

inside there." And the Court was unanimous, I 

believe, on the point that that furnished probable 

cause. But what is different from Illinois versus 

McArthur, and this case, is that the police officers 

have the consent of someone who reasonably appears to 

them to have common authority, someone who's living in 

the marital home, someone who is in a position to know 

what's going on and exercise her own independent 

authority. And for this Court to say, "Well, there 

are alternatives" -- you know, the police could pull 

Respondent out of the house and quarantine it while 

they go get a warrant, or the police could do other 

investigation, or they could rely on exigent 

circumstances -- what that does is treats her consent 

as worth nothing. It reduces her --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, not nothing, 

because we have cases that have said: If the co-

inhabitant is not there, he relinquishes whatever 

right he had to object. But if the co-inhabitant is 

there, and says no, what's the matter with giving 

effect to that? 

MR. DREEBEN: I think it's very odd to say

that, in Matlock, the right was relinquished, when 

Matlock was arrested and taken to a police car and was 

never asked for consent, or that Rodriguez 

relinquished his right by falling asleep in his own 

apartment. What really -- I would qualify my 

statement, though, in response to your comment, 

Justice O'Connor. It's not that it treats it as 

nothing. It would treat her consent as 100 percent 

valid when he's asleep or absent, no matter how much 

we know he would object, and it would treat it as zero 

when he's on the scene and vocalizes an objection. 

And I think that that would protect Fourth Amendment 

rights only by happenstance, or, worse, it would 

simply be an invitation to the --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but it's by 

happenstance that the police find the wife in the 

house. I mean, it's six of one, half a dozen of the 

other. It's a happenstance. 

MR. DREEBEN: Well, in this case, as in many 

other cases involving this kind of potential incident, 

the wife called the police to the scene. So, there 

was a reason for them to be on the scene. It was a 

perfectly valid investigatory step. And once they 

acquired the information relating to drugs on the 

premises, and had the authority of someone who's in

charge of the premises, I submit that the police 

should be able to conduct the search as a reasonable 

matter under the Fourth Amendment, just as they would 

if Respondent had been asleep or if Respondent had 

said, "Well, I have to go now. Am I free to go?" and 

the police said that, "You are." 

And I don't think that it always would be an 

advantage for the nonconsenting tenant, somebody like 

Mr. Randolph, to insist on the police getting a 

warrant or conducting a probable-cause arrest. If 

he's arrested, he's taken down to the station, he has 

a search incident to arrest, he may not get a hearing 

for 48 hours. If the police do have to get a warrant, 

they are entitled to search anywhere and everywhere in 

the premises; whereas, in this case, one of 

Respondent's main claims is that she wasn't credible. 

Well, if she wasn't credible, and she had led the 

police upstairs, and the police had found nothing, 

that might have been the end of the whole incident. 

And I think that it's because of the socially valuable 

function of efficiently resolving accusations, 

potentially dueling accusations of criminal conduct 

that consent searches can facilitate, that this Court 

has said that consent searches are a positive social 

good and should be encouraged, rather than

discouraged. 

JUSTICE THOMAS: Mr. Dreeben, is it -- is 

this case materially different if she simply ran 

upstairs, grabbed the straw, brought it down, and 

handed it to the police officer? It's, in effect, the 

same thing, isn't it? 

MR. DREEBEN: It is, in effect, the same 

thing. And I think that, had that happened, there 

would have been no question that, assuming that the 

police reasonably believed that she had authority to 

do it, and possibly even if they didn't, the 

contraband would have come into the hands of law 

enforcement, and there is really no reason, or 

doctrine under the Fourth Amendment, to deny it. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to take the 

position that there's no legal difference between, (a) 

entering a home and taking something, and, (b) 

receiving it on the outside? 

MR. DREEBEN: I think that the difference, 

when you receive something with the consent of someone 

who has the authority to exercise control over it, is 

a question of whether she leads the police upstairs, 

or whether she brings the item downstairs. And, for 

Fourth Amendment purposes, I don't see a difference. 

Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

Mr. Goldstein. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

The Court should hold that it is not 

reasonable for officers to conduct a consent search 

when a person with an equivalent interest in the 

premises expressly objects. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the 

telephone call between a husband and wife, and the 

wife tells the police, "Listen in on this call"? 

She's consented to the monitoring of the conversation, 

the husband has not. Maybe he even begins the call by 

saying, "I -- don't let anybody else listen to this." 

It's clear that that is admissible, isn't it? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: It is, Mr. Chief Justice, 

although not on the theory of third-party consent. 

The analog to your hypothetical, which is this Court's 

decision in Lopez, is Justice Thomas' reference to 

Coolidge versus New Hampshire -- to the New Hampshire 

case. And what happens there is, this -- Mrs. 

Randolph could take the cocaine and give it to the

officer. She was participating in giving an item to 

them. It is not the same, I think, when she 

authorizes the police to conduct a generalized search 

of the premises. It would be as if --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: She's consenting. 

It's an intrusion, in the one case, on the 

conversation; in the other case, on the home. In the 

telephone case, it's recognized, in the law, the 

consent of one party subjects the other to having the 

conversation monitored. In this case, the consent of 

one party subjects the other party to the search. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: But -- yes, Mr. Chief 

Justice. I do think that Lopez and White, in that 

line of cases, established that other things that 

people do consent to can expose us to intrusions on 

our property. What I think, however, is, it doesn't 

follow that she can authorize the -- them to conduct a 

generalized search of the premises. It's as if she 

were saying, "You can listen in on" --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- "all the phone calls" --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Excuse me. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- "in the house." 

JUSTICE SOUTER: It was -- it was the -- it 

was a search only of premises with respect to which

she had, supposedly, common rights. I mean, we take 

the case on that assumption. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: You do --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- Justice Souter. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: If she and her husband, you 

know -- if she had a right to be in only two rooms, 

she couldn't authorize the search of the whole house, 

right? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- correct. But, Justice 

Souter, I think the thing that is important -- and I 

want to get to your line of questioning about exactly 

what the nature of the State's argument is -- is that 

he had a distinct individual right to privacy at the 

core of the home, as opposed to, for example, 

information privacy. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right, then he --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- if he --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- begs the question 

-- it begs the question to say "it's a distinct 

individual right to privacy." It's a little academic 

to talk about his individual right to privacy when

he's sharing the home with someone else. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, that's 

why I finished off on that. Let me just focus on the 

important part of my statement. And that is, we are 

talking about a search of the home, at the core of the 

Fourth Amendment. This Court's doctrines are quite 

different about situations in which you share 

information with third parties. 

Let me step back and do the case before 

Lopez, and then explain how it was extended to Lopez. 

Cases like White say, "If you give information to 

someone else, you -- they can give it to the police 

without conducting a search of you." This is a very 

different situation. The police are clearly 

conducting a search of a premises that I think, 

Justice Souter, it has to be agreed, he has a 

reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to. 

Now, Justice Souter, it is absolutely right 

that there are instances in which people have 

expectations of privacy, and yet searches occur, 

notwithstanding those. And there is an argument to be 

made here that says, "Look, he has a reasonable 

expectation of privacy, but the police came in for a 

different reason." That would be true, for example, 

if there was a warrant; they would come in,

notwithstanding his reasonable expectation. That 

would be true if there were exigent circumstances. 

But the theory of consent is very different. 

Schneckloth, Zap, all of the Court's precedents --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it -- let me make 

sure I understand where you're going. We agree that 

he had a reason -- everybody agrees, I guess, that he 

has a reasonable expectation. He can -- he can raise 

his Fourth Amendment claim. Your argument is that, 

even though we get past the reasonable expectation, 

there's a second reasonableness question, and that is, 

Is the search, itself, reasonable? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Good guess. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: And that's the focus of 

your argument --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Exactly --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- correct? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- right. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: But I do think it's 

important, of course, this Court's precedents have 

often said that the degree of the expectation informs 

the reasonableness of the search. A consent --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- search is reasonable.

keep the policeman out than she has to have the 

policeman in?

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- of the need for this, 

because it's the other thing that's on my mind. The 

two words that came into my mind are "spousal abuse." 

All right? I would say maybe there's a pretty good 

need for this. The husband's beating her up. And 

there isn't evidence of that, but she's sitting in the 

kitchen table, and the neighbors hear something odd, 

and they call the police. "We'd better look into it." 

They come to the door. She says, "Um, hmmm, oh, I'd 

like, Officer, for you to just come upstairs to my 

bedroom for a minute." Is there any neighbor, friend, 

or policeman, in those circumstances, who wouldn't go? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, because 

she's not authorizing a search -- she wants them to 

come in and talk to her, wherever, in the house --

that might be a different case. The two words --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no. It's the question 

of the rule. I haven't seen anything on your side 

that would advocate a rule that would not prevent the 

many, many, many, I believe -- I am not an expert --

ambiguous cases of domestic spousal abuse from being 

investigated by the policeman. And maybe you can tell 

me you've looked into it empirically and I'm wrong, 

and that's why I'm bringing it up. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Okay. I have, and I

can. Since 1974, when this Court decided Matlock, the 

Federal and State courts, combined, have considered 

this question. And so, there was a finding of 

evidence, and it led to a suppression hearing. That's 

the best that I can do. Fifteen times, all the 

Federal and State courts, once every two years. It is 

the case that in that -- in -- last year alone, there 

were 200,000 domestic disputes that were reported. 

But that's just the city of Chicago. 

What we're considering here is the situation 

in which there is no real need for the police to --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but -- no, I'm not 

getting your answer. Are you telling me that it is 

the law in Chicago, for example, that if a policeman 

responds to a call, a call of -- it's ambiguous --

what it says is, "An anonymous caller said there's an 

odd situation next door. Will you check out 2355 

Maple Street?" He goes there. The wife looks a 

little oddly at him, but they're sitting at the table, 

and she says, "Officer, I'd like you to come upstairs 

with me." The husband says no. Are you saying that 

the law is clear in Chicago that the policeman can't 

do it? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: No. What I'm --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Where --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's what --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- equally divided --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- I thought it was not 

clear. And, therefore, what I'm asking you for is --

if your rule --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- is the law --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- there are 200,000 cases 

a year in Chicago, alone. I think that there might be 

many ambiguous cases. So, you relieve me of my 

concern that if you win this case, in those ambiguous 

situations, where the wife wants the policeman in, and 

she's afraid to tell him why, until she gets him up to 

the room -- she wants him in -- and he, now under your 

rule, as far as I can see, could not go in. And I'm 

telling you, quite frankly, that's what bothers me a 

lot.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: All right. Let me answer 

this on several different levels. First, there is no 

serious argument that we interfere with investigating 

abuse claims. The conversation can happen. It may 

not happen, arguably, in a place that he has a right 

to privacy, but it can happen outside. It happens 

outside all the time. If there is any suggestion that 

a reasonable officer would believe that there was an 

ongoing crime, there was abuse going on right then, 

then it's clear that exigent circumstances would 

authorize the --

JUSTICE BREYER: There aren't exigent 

circumstances. In the case I'm thinking of, I'm 

thinking of what I call "ambiguity," and there are 

many such cases, I believe, of spousal abuse, where 

the wife is intimidated. Now, maybe I'm wrong on my 

facts, but those are the cases I'm worried about. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, I am not an 

expert in spousal abuse; and so, I'm not -- which I 

think is a very serious issue. I do know one thing 

about my rule, and that is that, under our rule, and 

under the rule that the Georgia Supreme Court 

articulated, they are allowed to speak with her, 

including speaking to her outside. It's true, there 

may be some sacrifice. And you have identified a

sacrifice. And that is, she can't take them into a 

room in which he has a constitutional expectation of 

privacy. I will concede that if he says, "I don't 

want you in the bedroom," that will be a sacrifice. 

But what I am saying is that there is no serious 

argument that they can't have the conversation in a 

place where she feels secure. That's on the porch, 

that's in a police car. 

If she says, "I need you to come up," and 

there's been abuse, then what would have happened in 

this case -- let me explain what happened in this 

case. The officers asked Mr. Randolph first. He said 

no. They found out -- had found out from her that 

there was drug paraphernalia on the premises. What 

they had to do in order to conduct this search -- if 

they wanted to search, rather than having her bring 

the materials out -- is to pick up the phone and get a 

telephonic warrant, which would have taken less than 5 

minutes. 

The real reason I bring to your attention 

the 200,000 domestic disturbances is that what you 

should be concerned about, I think, is not the 15 

cases, which is not a serious intrusion on law 

enforcement interests over 30 years, but it's the many 

times in which our family relationships ebb and flow.

 We are concerned here with the person -- the Fourth 

Amendment is -- it's not the person who has the drugs 

or the abuser. Consent searches involve a situation 

in which the police come to the door, and they say, 

"Can we search?" Because they do as much as they are 

permitted to do. And the person just says, "Sure," 

perhaps completely ignorant of her rights. There's no 

reason to believe anything is going on. And what the 

State's position is, is that, despite the fact that 

this is the home, and that the core of the 

constitutional right to privacy in the text of the 

Fourth Amendment is that the only thing he can do to 

be secure in the language of the Constitution is not 

live with someone else. Remember, the theory --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, all --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- reflects is the -

-

JUSTICE SCALIA: Go on. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was just going to 

say, it just reflects the expectation of privacy. And 

when you do live with someone else, you compromise 

your individual privacy interest to that extent. We 

know that you compromise it to the extent that if you 

happen not to be there, and that person says, "Sure,

come on in and search," that's going to bind you, as 

well. Why is it -- why do you not compromise the 

expectation to the extent of giving the other person 

the right to consent? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, I do 

think you've put your finger on it. 

And I just want to say, Justice Souter, that 

I do think that the other side's argument inevitably 

does revolve around this notion of an expectation of 

privacy. 

And, Mr. Chief Justice, I think the 

expectation is -- and this is what the Court said in 

Minnesota versus Carter -- that, while it's 

technically possible that the people -- Minnesota 

versus Olson, I'm sorry -- the people that we live 

with will admit others over our objection, our 

expectation about what -- about what will happen, our 

reasonable expectation, is different. And I also want 

to take --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but Olson was a 

standing case. Olson was not confronting this 

situation. In Olson, the police simply went in 

without a warrant. And the argument was made that 

this person was not the normal inhabitant of the --

what was he? A houseguest or something of the sort.

And the only issue that Olson addressed was his right 

to raise a Fourth Amendment claim. It did not respond 

to the issue that you are raising, which is the 

reasonable extent of search. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, that's why 

I, sort of, paused and came to you. And that is, I do 

think that the other side's argument -- I want to say 

two things. One is that it inevitably reduces to the 

idea that we have a lessened expectation of --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- privacy --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't see that --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- at all. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: They concede -- the only 

expectation of privacy you've got to have for Fourth 

Amendment purposes in order to raise a claim is a 

minimal one -- they concede that the -- that this 

individual has an expectation of privacy sufficient to 

raise a Fourth Amendment claim. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: But --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Their argument is that, 

although he can raise it, the rights, however they may 

be derived on the part of his wife, allowed her to

admit the police -- in effect, thwarting his 

expectations. Your argument, as I understand it, is 

that when the police search with that kind of 

permission, over his objection, it's not a reasonable 

search. Isn't that the way to structure the issue? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, I think it 

is. I will only say, in my defense, that their brief 

articulates it in the manner that I was describing it, 

I think, with the Chief Justice. But let me --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- let me --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- I -- I agree with you. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. All right. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: There is this talk about 

lessened --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- expectation, and I -- I 

think, ultimately, that's irrelevant. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: All right. Let me look at 

it through the other lens. And that is from the 

perspective of a reasonable police officer. I think 

there are two points to make. The first is, I -- the 

common ground between the sides in the case is, you 

look at it from the perspective of the person who 

arrives at the house, and you ask what is reasonable.

 And if someone arrives at the house, it is a 

different matter entirely if, as in Matlock or in 

Rodriguez, someone says, "Come on in," and they -- you 

believe they have authority over the premises, versus 

you come to the house and someone with authority over 

the premises says, "Come on in," and the other person 

says, "No, stay out." 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Now what's your --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not a 

fair reading of Rodriguez. There, it was, "Come on 

in, he's asleep." It was quite clear that if he were 

awake, he was going to say, "Don't come in." 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, the 

Government has argued successfully in this Court that 

we don't make any assumptions about whether people 

will consent or not. There are innumerable cases in 

the lower courts --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe we don't, but 

isn't there -- isn't the -- isn't Mr. Dreeben's 

argument fair that no one in his right mind would have 

expected Matlock to agree to this? It is clear that 

Matlock, had he known what was going on -- and he may 

have; I don't know -- would have objected? So that if 

we accept your argument that the presence of the 

person there expressing an objection is what makes the

difference, then Matlock and Rodriguez become almost 

silly cases. They are -- they are -- they're cases 

that rest upon an assumption that is clearly contrary 

to fact. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Souter. And 

that is, the Government has argued, and this Court has 

accepted, again -- and this is a different point; and 

that is, you have to have a clear line for police 

officers that is administrable. And the line that is 

reflected in Matlock and Rodriguez is: If you get 

consent to come into the house from someone who has 

the common authority to do so, that will be 

sufficient, but that doesn't mean that if some -- and 

so, you don't have to go around and -- finding other 

people and asking other people. It's just as if you 

showed up at a house, and you were invited in. You 

wouldn't say, "Well, let me check with everybody else" 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure, but --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- "who lives here." 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- an equally clear line 

would simply be that, if the area to be searched is 

one of common tenancy or occupation or whatnot, the 

only consent that will suffice will be the consent of 

the person against whom you expect to use any evidence

found. Easy clear line. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's true, Justice Souter, 

there are a lot of possible clear lines. What I'm 

describing to you is why the difference between 

Matlock and this case is one in kind, and that is that 

Matlock, I think, reflects an administrable rule, and 

that is, if you do have permission from someone who 

has the authority to admit you, you don't have to go 

ask anybody else. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: But that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But an equally 

administrable rule here is that, even though the 

person you suspect objects, you can still go in, if a 

person with authority otherwise says you can. Equally 

clear rule, and it has one advantage: It does not 

turn Matlock and Rodriguez into silly cases. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, I don't 

think they're silly cases. I think that it is an 

important rule that the police show up and they are 

able to rely -- if they only hear from one person, 

they're able to rely on that person. I don't -- the -

- I'm not claiming that our rule has great 

administrative advantages over the other side's. What 

I'm saying is that it is not necessary to sacrifice

the individual's privacy who lives in the house -- as 

you say, has an expectation of privacy. And so, let 

me return --

JUSTICE BREYER: An expectation of privacy. 

I have a lingering question here I'd like to get your 

view on. I don't know what the expectation is, is my 

problem. If I think of social -- I've never been in a 

situation, frankly, where one person said, "Stay out," 

and the other said, "Come in." So, I don't know what 

I'd do. If I imagine myself in a normal social 

situation, I think probably, if I am the typical 

person, which may or may not be, I --

[Laughter.] 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- I think I'd say, "Well, 

you know, I don't want to have anything to do with 

this." If it's a dinner party, forget it. But if I'm 

in a situation such as the police might be involved 

in, where I think there is some danger, there is 

something wrong in the house, there's something odd 

about it, I don't think the average person would just 

say, "I'm going away." I think the average person 

either would come in, or he'd say, "I'll come in for a 

while. I'm going to call the police," or they're --

you just wouldn't have that reaction, "I want nothing 

to do with it." That's the reaction, you know --

that's a bad reaction, when you want nothing to do 

with a dangerous situation. So, I think, in that 

situation, the normal reaction would be, "I'm going 

in," or, "I'm going to get some help," or, "I'm going 

to get a friend," or, "I'm going to call the police." 

So, I don't know you do have expectations of 

that kind, in those situations, though you might with 

a dinner party. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, I think 

that's why it's important that our rule is not that 

the police should go away. We call for a balance 

here, and --

JUSTICE BREYER: But I want you to address 

the question of how the legal category of "reasonable 

expectation of privacy" fits in with what I just said, 

where I'm assuming, in some social situations, you do 

think you'd be left alone; but, in the typical 

situation, stretching well beyond, but certainly 

including, situations of danger where the police might 

be involved, you wouldn't have an expectation that you 

will be left alone. I want to know how those facts, 

if they are facts -- and you can say they were not --

fit within the category called "reasonable expectation 

of privacy." 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, the Court

has precedent on this very point, and that is -- and, 

Justice Souter, he is asking about reasonable 

expectations of privacy -- Minnesota versus Olson. 

The Court considered this and said the very reason 

that person had standing and could -- had a Fourth 

Amendment right is because they did have a reasonable 

expectation of privacy in the premises, that, even 

though they had no property rights to keep any -- this 

is the overnight guest -- had no property rights to 

keep anybody out at all, their expectation -- their 

reasonable expectation of privacy for Fourth Amendment 

purposes -- is that if somebody wanted to come in, to 

which they objected, that objection would be honored. 

Now, I don't want to lose sight of the fact 

that our position is the balance; and that is, we 

don't tell the police to go away. We say, "Look, if 

she tells you that there's contraband in the house, 

she can bring it out." That's the Coolidge case. 

And I do think, Justice Thomas, that there 

is a difference in kind, not degree, in giving 

something to someone and then having -- versus having 

a uncabined search of a house. The complaint --

JUSTICE THOMAS: The -- but this was not an 

uncabined search. That's my problem. What you're --

what you're -- the bottom, you're saying to us, is

that it's not unreasonable -- an unreasonable search 

if she went upstairs and brought the straw down, 

right? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, because that's not a 

search. 

JUSTICE THOMAS: Okay. But you're saying it 

is an unreasonable search for her to lead the police 

officer to the straw. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice --

JUSTICE THOMAS: Which is what she did. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Thomas, it's how it 

played out, because they stopped the search then, 

because she withdrew her consent. But what she 

authorized was something very different. She --

JUSTICE THOMAS: But she withdrew it after 

he observed the straw. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Justice Thomas, that's 

absolutely correct. My point, instead, is that what 

happened here, in terms of the consent, and what the 

State's rule of law would authorize, and what Matlock 

and Rodriguez authorize if they're extended to this 

point, is not, "Take me to the drugs," which is an 

interesting proposition, but, instead, "Go ahead and 

search the whole house." So, our point, Justice 

Breyer is, "Look, don't leave. Get a telephonic

warrant. It takes 5 minutes. If you know there's 

something in the house, bring it out. If you have 

anything to -- any reason to believe there's ongoing 

criminality, seal the house." 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, any reason to believe 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Sorry. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- you can't enter without 

probable cause. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Right.

exigent circumstances. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose you have 

suspicions of a domestic problem that's ongoing. It's 

short of probable cause, but you have reasonable 

suspicion. Does that alter the nonconsenting party's 

interest and elevate the consenting party's interest? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, I don't 

think that it does. Our view of the law is that the 

question is, When the property rights are -- and their 

-- their control over the property, I should say; I 

don't mean to invoke the common law -- when the

control over the property is equivalent, then, in that 

tie, if you will, the Fourth Amendment controls. If -

- there are doctrines designed to protect against 

situations in which you have concerns about ongoing 

criminality and protecting people. But that's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you talk about 

that tie, your approach applies in the case -- a 

dormitory, you have a common room, there are ten rooms 

off of it, nine people say, "Sure, come on in and 

search," and the one person says, "No." That one 

person exercises a veto over a search of the common 

area? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, the 

straightforward rule that I have argued for today is 

that if you have an equivalent interest in the 

premises -- it is, of course, the State's rule that, 

if nine people object, Matlock says that any one of 

them can let them in, and an individual can override 

the objections of everybody else in the house. What 

I'm saying, I think, just to return to the basics, is, 

I do think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- well, what 

is your answer --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to that case?

Your case is that, if one out of ten who share the 

common room says to the police, "You may not come in," 

that controls? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't think that has to 

follow from our rule. It's true, we have articulated 

one broad rule that would allow the Fourth Amendment 

to control, but I think if we analogize to the social 

situation -- if you said to yourself, "What do you 

expect will happen if nine people that you live with 

want to let in someone and you're the only one who's 

going to object?" -- I think it would be perfectly 

reasonable to say to -- that individual expects the --

them to come in. 

Justice Souter, let me return -- I want to 

make sure I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- I -- you assume 

we got -- there goes the -- that -- there goes any 

bright line administrable rule, I guess. 

[Laughter.] 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Souter, I honestly 

don't think that's true. I think that Illinois versus 

Rodriguez, on this question, which is assessing the 

degree of the authority over the premises, does call 

for a "totality of the circumstances" inquiry. 

I also don't know that I fully answered your

point, that we look at this question from the 

perspective of the officer and the reasonableness of 

the search. And let me just say that, in Matlock and 

in Rodriguez, the Court's analysis was that it's 

reasonable, because the person whose privacy is 

intruded on has assumed some risk. The Court does 

look to the privacy interests of the person who is 

ultimately the defendant. That's a -- an element of 

the reasonableness inquiry. And our point, 

fundamentally, is that it cannot be the case that when 

the framers enacted the Fourth Amendment so that you 

could live with other people and have a private space 

away from the Government, that you, merely by living 

with your family, assume the risk that your privacy 

will be lost. That assumption of the risk --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, can I just take 

the next step in my hypothetical? The wife and the 

two adult children who live in the home say, "Come on 

in," and the husband says, "No." What happens then? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: On our broadest rule, the 

husband would control, although it doesn't follow, 

from our -- that, to affirm the judgment, you have to 

say that, because I think you could say that, 

reasonably, the person realizes they would be 

outvoted. But I do think the children is an important

point. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Reasonably, the 

person realizes he would be outvoted? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it does go to 

his presumably objectively reasonable views of what 

nature of privacy he has. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. And what --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if he thinks, 

"Look, I've been having a bad time with my wife. I 

think she's going to consent and let the police in if 

I'm not" -- then his objection shouldn't control? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, when -- I 

agree with you objectively. This Court didn't, for 

example, in Matlock and Rodriguez, look at the 

particular family dynamics at that time. It looks to 

broader social understandings. 

I did want to return to your "children" 

point. Remember -- and I think this is a vital point 

-- and that is, the Courts of Appeals uniformly 

conclude, after Matlock and Rodriguez, that children 

are residents, which is the inquiry in Illinois versus 

Rodriguez, and they can give consent to search a home. 

It necessarily follows that if you extend that rule, 

Matlock and Rodriguez, to this case, that children,

because they have the authority to admit the police --

minor children, 12, 14, 15 -- can then authorize the 

search, notwithstanding the objection of the parents. 

Now, if everyone agrees, "That can't be right, it's 

the parents' home," that's because we are assessing --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the case that 

says that, that the child's invitation overrides the 

parents' objection? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, that 

question hasn't been confronted by any court we've 

checked. But what I -- what the Courts of Appeals 

have confronted repeatedly, and uniformly agree -- and 

it's in our brief -- is that children satisfy the 

Matlock and Rodriguez --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- standard. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- would a mother-in-law. 

[Laughter.] 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they don't have 

the same -- they don't have the same property interest 

as a spouse does, as a tenant in common or whatever. 

The child doesn't have that interest in the home. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, that's 

right, but, of course, that's not the inquiry under

Matlock and Rodriguez. If we take your point, then we 

are definitely moving beyond Matlock and Rodriguez. 

We're going to have to look to more. And my point is 

that, if we do look to more than simply the fact that 

the officers have found someone, however ignorant, has 

the ability to consent in their own right, if we're 

going to assess the other factors, the rule should 

look -- the Court should look to what the ordinary 

social understandings and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, your time 

is almost up, but I want to know if you place any 

weight at all on the fact that the husband was the 

target in this case. The target said, "No," and the 

one who wasn't under suspicion said, "Yes." Does that 

make any difference? 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: The -- I do not believe, as 

a matter of doctrine, that it does. I do think, 

however, that it informs this Court's analysis of 

reasonableness, in the sense that the Court, in 

Schneckloth, said, "We are not going to allow consent 

to circumvent the requirements of getting a warrant." 

And it is the case -- we have to inescapably agree, I 

think, that this is simply a way of getting around the 

warrant requirement. They wanted to find out 

something about him. He had a privacy interest in the

premises. He said, "No." The Constitution says, "You 

have somebody who's cooperating with you. Let them 

tell you what's going on in the house." And Illinois 

versus McArthur says, "Seal off the premises." In 

fact, Illinois versus McArthur is -- the very point of 

the Court in that case was that it's much better to 

seal the premises and get a warrant, which will define

 JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh. 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: But, inescapably, what's 

going on, there are -- I think that this is not a case 

that follows, necessarily, from Matlock and Rodriguez. 

And there is a bright line to be drawn, and that is, 

you are going to have to not live with your family, 

which is precisely what the Fourth Amendment is about, 

in order not to assume the risk of the police coming 

in. The reasonableness determination is a balancing 

of law enforcement and privacy interests. The privacy 

interests are very high. The police can easily get a 

telephonic warrant or have the materials brought out 

to them. It is not necessary to take this case, when 

so rarely has it been that the police have needed to 

use this authority. 

If there are no further questions.

Goldstein.
