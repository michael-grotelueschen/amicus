CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Kircher v. Putnam Funds Trust. 

Mr. Frederick. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FREDERICK 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. FREDERICK: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

This case concerns the appealability of 

remand orders under the Securities Litigation Uniform 

Standards Act, or SLUSA. 

Our position is that the general rule 

prohibiting appealability applies in this case for 

three reasons. 

First, section 1447(d) has been consistently 

construed to prohibit appeal of remand orders based on 

a district court's lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. 

That rule governs even if the district court 

incorrectly construes a subject-matter jurisdiction 

provision. 

Second, SLUSA section 77p(c) concededly 

defines removal jurisdiction and it does so by 

incorporating the criteria for preemption. Thus, the 

court's subject-matter jurisdiction is coextensive with

those cases that SLUSA preempts. 

And third, Congress knows how to make remand 

orders appealable when it wants to, but SLUSA contains 

no provision for appellate review of remand orders. 

Under Respondent's approach, the Federal courts would 

obtain jurisdiction in cases not subject to SLUSA 

preemption, but there's no indication that Congress 

intended that result. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Under your approach, Mr. 

Frederick, the Federal court would decide the principal 

substantive issue in the case, the principal legal 

issue, nonfactual perhaps, and then decide that is has 

no jurisdiction if it finds that it doesn't come within 

-- within (c), sends it back to the State court. Is --

is the State court bound by -- by that finding by the 

Federal court? 

MR. FREDERICK: No, it's not. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? 

MR. FREDERICK: Because under this Court's 

longstanding precedent, for there to be preclusion, 

there must be a right of appellate review. So if you 

agree that the general rule of 1447(d) applies and 

there is no right to appeal the remand order, then the 

basis on which that order is -- is founded, the 

preemption of SLUSA is open for the State court to

address on remand. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And for this Court, I 

assume, at least theoretically, on petition for 

certiorari? 

MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, through the 

State court system. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What -- what was the basis 

then, or was there a basis, for Judge Easterbrook's 

comment, it's now or never? 

MR. FREDERICK: He was wrong. He was wrong. 

The issue of preemption under SLUSA can be raised by 

the defendants on remand in the State courts. It can 

be litigated. It's important to note that the removal 

provision says, shall be removable. It's at the 

defendants' discretion whether they want to ask the 

Federal court to test whether SLUSA preempts the case 

or to keep it in State court for the State court to 

apply SLUSA and thereby hold that the class action 

would be unsustainable. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we have a standard --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have any cases that --

that are like this one which are like this one which 

involve not just res judicata of -- of the -- of the 

finding by the Federal court, but the law of the case? 

I mean this is the same case when it's remanded.

You've already had a court that has found a particular 

element with respect to this case. It seems to me 

highly unusual to have the same issue in the same case 

then decided by a second court. Do you have any -- any 

parallel? 

MR. FREDERICK: There are cases in the lower 

courts, Your Honor, in the complete preemption area 

that have held that a removal based on the doctrine of 

complete preemption was not sustainable because the 

case was not completely preempted, but holding that 

preemption, implied conflict preemption, can be applied 

by the State courts on remand. 

And it's important to note here that there --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't have any case of 

ours, though. 

MR. FREDERICK: Not that I'm aware of, but 

what the City of Waco case says, upon which they base 

their reliance, is that the reason why there was appeal 

of that particular order was because it would be held 

preclusive. Here, it would not be held preclusive 

because there is no right of appellate review. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is -- is there --

correct me if I'm wrong, but I -- I had thought there 

was an -- an easier answer, and that is that the -- the 

decision that ultimately the State court will make, as

to whether there is or is not preclusion, is not 

identical to the decision that the Federal court --

that the district court makes on the motion for remand 

because on the -- and this is the way I was going about 

it. 

On the motion for remand, all a Federal court 

decides is whether, in fact, there is a colorable basis 

for the removal. When it goes back, if it does go 

back, to the State court, there will be an opportunity 

not to go merely to the stage of colorable basis, but 

to litigate it ultimately on the merits. So -- so that 

what we have is a -- in effect, a kind of quick-look 

finding at the Federal level, and that does not 

preclude a -- a complete development of the issue on 

the merits in the State court, if that's where it goes. 

MR. FREDERICK: That is certainly true, 

although I would take issue with the notion of there 

being a colorable claim. I don't think that the SLUSA 

removal is analogous to the Federal officer removal 

statute where the statute itself says the defense has 

to be under color of law, and this Court in the Mesa v. 

California case said that phrase is where the colorable 

claim creates article III jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but do you take 

the position --

 MR. FREDERICK: But I -- I don't -- sorry. 

If I could just finish. I don't contest the rest of 

it, which is that on remand, preemption can be 

developed through amended pleadings, through facts that 

are developed --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you must take 

issue with the this is only a quick determination, 

unless you also agree with -- disagree with Justice --

Judge Easterbrook when he said, the decision for the 

Federal court is only two things. It's either remand 

or dismiss the action. That is, the Federal court 

under no circumstances will keep this case for trial. 

Either it will dismiss it outright or it will remand. 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, under their theory, 

though, Justice Ginsburg, the court could, because of 

their construction of the removal jurisdiction 

provision, would retain jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but that was not --

certainly not the Seventh Circuit's understanding. 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, and we think that that 

position that they have advanced in this Court is 

incorrect, and I would agree with your postulate that 

what the Federal district court does and it has 

jurisdiction to do is to decide whether preemption 

applies and then remand the case, or if preemption does

apply, to dismiss it. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Whether preemption applies 

or whether there's a colorable basis for saying? I 

thought you were saying that the district court decides 

whether preemption applies. 

MR. FREDERICK: It does -- it does do that. 

It's actually --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you don't -- you don't 

agree with what Justice Souter was saying, that all 

it's -- all it's making is a colorable basis. 

MR. FREDERICK: I thought I expressed my 

position there. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, you take the 

position that -- and -- and you may well be right, but 

I mean, you take the position that there is a complete 

determination on the merits at the -- at the stage at 

which the district court rules on the motion to remand. 

MR. FREDERICK: That's -- on the basis of the 

record then before it. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

MR. FREDERICK: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say on the basis 

of the record then before it. I mean, they can -- they 

can -- can they put in any evidence they want? 

MR. FREDERICK: The court always has the

authority to have evidence taken to determine its own 

jurisdiction. That's routinely done by district 

courts. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, as I 

understand it, at least the Seventh Circuit's fix on 

this case was that the Federal courts have adjudicatory 

authority to do one thing and to do that one thing 

finally, that is, to decide whether this is a case that 

cannot be brought in any court or whether it's a case 

that Congress has left over for the States still to 

deal with. That was the whole theory of the Seventh 

Circuit, that this is no quick look. The -- the 

Federal courts are making a final determination. And I 

think that would exclude what Justice Souter has 

suggested. 

MR. FREDERICK: I -- I agree with you that 

that is how the Seventh Circuit described the opinion 

and what -- what the adjudicatory authority was, and 

that is why we take issue with the Seventh Circuit. We 

do think that the State court on remand has any issue 

that the defendants want to raise before it. All that 

the Federal district court has done is to decide that 

-- that there was no basis for a SLUSA preemption 

because the requisites of subsection (b) had been 

satisfied.

 But I want to point out that the issue before 

you is whether or not that decision, correct or not, is 

appealable. And what is important in the error of the 

Seventh Circuit was that they held that that decision 

was appealable, and under the Thermtron rule, as 

applied in Gravitt and Things Remembered, even a 

district court decision that is erroneous in its 

construction of a subject-matter jurisdiction provision 

is still a remand based on subject-matter jurisdiction 

and therefore falls within the four corners --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it doesn't -- what 

Thermtron says is that we read (d) in conjunction with 

(c). Now, the reason that (c) is relevant here is 

because it says, if at any time before final judgment 

it appears that the district court lacks subject-

matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded. 

Presumably what (c) is thinking of are cases 

where subject-matter jurisdiction is not the whole 

issue before the -- the Federal court. It's thinking 

that subject-matter jurisdiction in certain instances, 

like a defect in a removal proceeding, is something 

that the -- that the Federal court could get to prior 

to a final judgment. 

But here, the final judgment in the Federal 

court is the very question of whether this is preempted

or not. And therefore, I guess what Easterbrook is 

thinking is that that isn't the kind of subject-matter 

jurisdiction dismissal to which (c) refers. 

Consequently, it is not within the scope of (d)'s no 

appellate review rule. 

MR. FREDERICK: And our problem with that, 

Justice Breyer, is that all eight district court 

decisions here thought that they were deciding subject-

matter jurisdiction, and they thought that because 

Federal preemption ordinarily is not a basis for 

removal. And --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. It's no doubt that all 

the lower courts then would be wrong. But the reason 

he says that they are wrong is because they looked at 

the word, subject-matter jurisdiction, in (c) without 

realizing that the reference in (c) is a reference to 

instances where subject-matter jurisdiction is not the 

whole issue; i.e., it's something other than the final 

Federal court decision. 

MR. FREDERICK: It -- it is --

JUSTICE BREYER: That would be the argument 

he's making. I would like your response. 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, functionally it is the 

equivalent of codifying the complete preemption 

doctrine, which is how SLUSA actually works. And in

the complete preemption cases, Beneficial Bank is what 

spells out this --

JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with you. You would 

also have to say that the same rule applies, one, to 

the complete preemption cases and, two, to sovereign 

immunity determinations under the Foreign Sovereign 

Immunity Act. But he would say that may be so, but 

nonetheless, Judge Easterbrook would say, well, so be 

it. That's what Congress intended. That is wrong to 

deprive someone of a right to appeal when it turns on a 

misreading of (c) and an incorporation of the 

misreading into (d). 

MR. FREDERICK: It would be a strikingly odd 

result, though, for this Court to reach that, given 

that Congress has clearly provided for appellate review 

of remand orders in other contexts, including in the 

Class Action Fairness Act, under tribal property 

disputes, the FDIC, the RTC, and specifically in 

1447(d) itself, civil rights cases. So Congress knows 

how to do this if that's what Congress had intended. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't the -- isn't 

the argument --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Frederick, can I ask 

you a question? 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that in those cases in

which Congress has provided, we -- we are not dealing 

with a situation in which the -- the removal or not, 

the preemption or not is the end of the litigation. 

Here, we've got a case in which there -- there are 

basically two kinds of preemption, as -- as you've 

recognized. There is -- there is regular preemption, 

on the basis of which there may or may not be a 

removal, and there is a preclusion of any litigation 

whatsoever. 

And in the cases in which Congress has made 

specific provision, were they -- the instances -- were 

they instances in which it was the second issue which 

precluded any litigation whatsoever? The answer may be 

yes. I just don't know. 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, I think that the 

closest analogy, again, is in the complete preemption 

area where the Court has held that, you know, the 

removal is based on complete preemption, and if that is 

found by the district court, that functionally 

terminates the litigation. 

But I would point out that even in the 

Federal officer removal statute, there's no appellate 

review of a district court's decision that the Federal 

officer statute was improperly invoked to remove an 

action. So what the securities defendants here are

asking for is something Congress didn't even give to 

Federal officers. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you one 

preliminary question just to be sure I understand the 

case. Is it your view -- when the petition for removal 

was filed, did the district -- Federal district court 

have jurisdiction to decide the preemption issue in 

your view? 

MR. FREDERICK: It had the -- it had the 

power to determine whether SLUSA applied. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: All right. 

MR. FREDERICK: And that's what section 

77p(c), when it says, as set forth in subsection (b), 

is referring to. So the district court analyzed those 

factors and it came --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So the -- there -- there 

was jurisdiction in the Federal court to entertain the 

removed case. 

MR. FREDERICK: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Then -- then why -- then 

how can you say the -- the remand was based on a lack of 

-- of jurisdiction? 

MR. FREDERICK: Because the courts held that 

the requisites of SLUSA of subsection (b) had not been 

satisfied.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but they -- they had 

held it acting on an interpretation of SLUSA before our 

decision in Dabit. 

MR. FREDERICK: That's correct. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And isn't it at least 

possible that they would -- would have decided that 

issue had they reviewed --

MR. FREDERICK: It is possible, but that's 

why the issue of the underlying district court's 

determination is not before you. The issue before you 

is can appellate jurisdiction be asserted to review 

that decision. 

But I would further point out, Justice 

Stevens, that the Dabit court assiduously avoided the 

kinds of claims that are present in our case, which is 

whether or not negligence can be asserted against the 

securities defendants for failure to fair-value price. 

Dabit was strictly a fraud case, as this Court made 

clear. This is a negligence case, and there is a part 

of subsection (b) which makes very clear that what 

SLUSA is getting at are claims based on fraud. 

But even if you were to disagree that the --

the district court had, you know, an alternate basis 

that had not been properly ventilated or addressed by 

the district court because it went off on the holder

theory that this Court rejected in Dabit, you still 

wouldn't have jurisdiction to decide that because of 

the general rule of 1447(d), which provides, as I have 

stated, that a court doesn't have jurisdiction to 

review -- appellate review of a remand order. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Frederick, will --

would you please explain something to me that you just 

said? You said that our complaint isn't about fraud. 

It isn't about deception. It's about negligence. But 

the Seventh Circuit reported and seemed to have no 

doubt about it that the complaints in this set of cases 

were based on allegations of deceit and manipulation, 

not mismanagement. 

MR. FREDERICK: That's incorrect, Justice 

Ginsburg. We've put the complaints before you. They 

are in the joint appendix. We have cited every 

paragraph in which those claims are asserted. 

The Seventh Circuit based its decision about 

that on a misunderstanding of the colloquy at oral 

argument in the Seventh Circuit, which Respondent's have 

recited the Web site. You can listen to the argument 

yourself. It did not contain any type of concession by 

counsel for the class that these claims were anything 

other than the negligence claims, which on the four

corners of the complaint, they assert themselves to be. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the Seventh Circuit 

said precisely, in particular, they did not argue in 

their briefs and did not maintain at oral argument, 

despite the court's invitation that their suits allege 

mismanagement rather than deceit or manipulation. So 

is that totally wrong, that you did do it -- mention it 

in your briefs? 

MR. FREDERICK: The briefs recounted what the 

claims are, which are negligence claims. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how could the Seventh 

Circuit have gotten it that wrong? 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, the Seventh Circuit 

made five crucial errors, that it was wrong to describe 

the district court as saying that removal was proper. 

The district court didn't say that. 

They were wrong to say that the remand was 

based on section 77(d)(4). That's not what the 

district court did. 

They were wrong to evaluate section 77p(c) 

without even reciting or construing the language. 

They were wrong to say that SLUSA's 

substantive decisions, quote, must be made by the 

Federal rather than the State judiciary. That's not 

correct.

 And they were wrong to say that it was now or 

never for appellate review whether an action under 

State law is preempted. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it -- it might 

have been that prior to Dabit, you would have been 

emphasizing -- or whoever would have been emphasizing 

the -- the fraud character of -- of the claims, and 

after Dabit, perhaps the negligence boat is the only 

one left for you. 

MR. FREDERICK: But the point, Mr. Chief 

Justice, is that this is on a basis of subject-matter 

jurisdiction. It's not waivable and we're permitted to 

say that a district court decision based on subject-

matter jurisdiction can look at the relevant claims. 

It is true that the perception at the time was that 

these holder theories evaded SLUSA. All of the courts 

up until that time of Kircher II had held that, and 

that's not an unreasonable position for a lawyer to 

take. 

Now, certainly after Dabit, those claims are 

foreclosed where there are holder fraud claims. We do 

-- we obviously don't take issue with that. 

But here, the claims in the complaint 

themselves are based on negligence, and it is certainly 

fair --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe this is not a 

fair -- how likely is it, given our determination in 

Dabit about how Congress intended to treat fraud 

claims, that negligence claims are going to fare any 

better? 

MR. FREDERICK: Well, this Court in the Santa 

Fe case, Mr. Chief Justice, said that negligence claims 

are not within 10b-5. Those are claims that are 

properly brought under State law. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Would it make sense --

MR. FREDERICK: So if the -- if the State 

court applies Dabit and Santa Fe, it will come to the 

conclusion that the holder theory is preempted under 

Dabit, but the negligence theory is not preempted under 

the Santa Fe case. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Does it make -- what's 

worrying me in the back of my mind is we have decided 

Dabit since this case was brought. Then I thought, 

well, could we remand this case in light of Dabit. 

Now, if we did that, we wouldn't decide the issue that 

you all want decided, and we'd let this, unfortunately, 

slightly confused situation continue to exist. 

What would be the consequence of that? Are 

there -- are there a lot of cases, or is this something 

that comes up often?

 MR. FREDERICK: It does come up often because 

the securities bar, every time they get a district 

court decision that they don't like, they want to 

appeal it, notwithstanding the general bar of 

appealability. So this issue is something that is very 

important to both sides in the development of this law. 

But I would further point out, Justice 

Breyer, that as this case has come up, your -- your 

view would have to be based on do you have appellate 

jurisdiction, and our submission is that you don't, 

subject for purposes of remanding the case in light of 

Dabit. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm trying to think. It 

seems if you -- it ought to work out similarly to what 

happens in a case where there's a Federal issue that 

you remove under. Now you've removed. And there also 

is a State issue pendent. Now, what the judge does is 

he says, defendant, you win on the Federal issue, and 

I'm going to send this thing back now, remand it, 

because I don't think I want to maintain here the State 

issue. And so it's a remand order. The case is 

remanded. 

Now, I think you get an appeal on your 

Federal issue there. And then -- then why shouldn't --

if that's so, shouldn't this work out the same way?

 MR. FREDERICK: Well, in the Cohill case, 

this Court addressed the situation where there was a 

Federal dismissal of the claims and the -- and the 

Federal district court remanded the State claims for 

consideration under -- under State jurisdiction. And 

the Court had internal discussion about whether or not, 

you know, there was appealability of what was left in 

the case. 

Our -- our position is that ordinarily a 

dismissal of a Federal claim is an appealable matter 

and that that is subject to appeal, but that a remand 

decision, which is what the district court made in this 

case, is not. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Shouldn't it work out the same? 

MR. FREDERICK: No, it shouldn't and the 

reason it shouldn't is because Congress has decided 

that it shouldn't. Congress has decided that there is 

a paramount interest in having decisions made on their 

merits, which is why there is not appellate review of 

remand orders. That's --

JUSTICE ALITO: But aren't you -- aren't you 

urging a very strange result that the -- the decision 

on the merits of the SLUSA preclusion issue should be 

decided by the State courts when the whole purpose of 

-- of that provision was to take matters out of the

State courts because there was a view in Congress that 

they were not being handled properly there? 

MR. FREDERICK: No, Justice Alito, to the 

contrary. They are being decided by Federal district 

courts. They're just no subject to appellate review, 

and it was because --

JUSTICE ALITO: I thought you said the merits 

of the issue was not going to be decided by the Federal 

court. 

MR. FREDERICK: No. Well, the -- the merits 

of the case are going to be decided by the State court. 

The question of whether there's a Federal defense 

based on SLUSA in the first instance is decided by the 

district court in remanding the case, and then if there 

becomes a basis through evidence or amendment to the 

pleadings or whatnot, if the defendants want to re-

raise their SLUSA preemption argument, they are 

certainly free to do that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So he's right that it's 

ultimately not decided by the Federal court. 

MR. FREDERICK: No, it is decided. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're saying the Federal 

court makes a decision which is not binding in the 

case. That decision can be undone by the State court. 

MR. FREDERICK: It is decided by the Federal

court within the confines of what Congress has 

determined based on its wording of SLUSA and its fact 

that, as this Court has said in Things Remembered, the 

Congress is presumed to accept the general rule of 

nonappealability unless it says so. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I understand that. 

Can you answer my question? You -- you were 

saying that the -- that the decision by the Federal 

court on this issue is not final. 

MR. FREDERICK: I'm saying that it is final 

for purposes of remand. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay, but it is not final --

MR. FREDERICK: And that in terms --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for purposes of the 

lawsuit. 

MR. FREDERICK: Because -- because what SLUSA 

does is it has an interplay between the removal 

jurisdiction provision and it says, as set forth in 

subsection (b). 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, but as 

long as you say that, the point that -- that Justice 

Alito makes is -- is well taken, that we -- we thought 

that this was a -- a statute designed to have the 

Federal courts determine this issue, and it turns out 

that the Federal court just takes the first swing at

it, and if a State court disagrees, it's -- it's free 

to do so. 

MR. FREDERICK: That is a policy choice that 

Congress made when not providing a special mechanism 

for appellate review of remand orders. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Of course, if the Federal 

district court says there is preclusion, therefore, 

case dismissed, that would be reviewable. 

MR. FREDERICK: That's correct, and that's 

where the uniformity of decisions would come from, the 

reviews by plaintiffs who's had their -- who have had 

their cases dismissed. Those are subject to appeal. 

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

It was quite a litany of errors that Judge 

Easterbrook is alleged to have committed in this case. 

I would submit, Your Honors, he committed none. 

Judge Easterbrook correctly recognized that 

the only issue put into play by these Petitioners was

the Dabit question. In their motion to remand this 

docket, docket number 20 in the Kircher case, they 

said, it is the fourth requirement, the in-connection-

with requirement, which is at issue in the present 

case. 

We pointed out in every subsequent brief that 

they had waived all other issues, and they never 

responded to that waiver. It is that, Justice 

Ginsburg, to which Judge Easterbrook was responding 

when he said plaintiffs never argued in their briefs 

and they did not maintain an argument that any other 

requirement --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Could we just -- can I ask 

you suppose they didn't waive it? Would their -- would 

their position have any merit? 

MR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. Their complaint 

rests on two factors that are clearly within SLUSA. 

First, misrepresentations. They claim that our 

prospectuses misled them into investing in these mutual 

funds and then --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me put the question 

just a little differently. Suppose the -- in Dabit, we 

decided that the distinction between the purchaser-

seller rule and the scope of 10b-5 did not prevent 

SLUSA from preempting. But does SLUSA preempt a claim

that is beyond the scope of rule 10b-5? 

MR. PERRY: Your Honor, SLUSA precludes 

precisely what subsection (b) says it precludes, which 

is beyond the scope of 10b-5. For example, 10b-5 

requires scienter. SLUSA has no scienter requirement. 

So a non-scienter-based State law claim is still 

precluded under SLUSA. 

What SLUSA requires is a misrepresentation, 

omission, manipulation, or deceptive device in 

connection with the purchase or sale of securities. 

Period. All of that is present in this complaint. 

They allege omissions. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they can always amend 

the complaint and pare it down and say now -- we -- we 

complained all along about negligence. Now, Judge, we 

are complaining about mismanagement on the defendants' 

part, nothing more. No manipulation. Cut out -- they 

could have such a complaint, and would that be 

precluded if -- if they started afresh in the State 

court and they said, we are complaining about 

mismanagement? We're not charging anyone with fraud or 

deception. Couldn't -- isn't that a viable claim? 

MR. PERRY: Your Honor, in this case they 

could not amend their complaint because the Federal 

jurisdiction is determined on the complaint that we

removed. And at the time of removal, it was clearly 

precluded by SLUSA. And the Court's cases are very 

clear that a plaintiff may not amend. For example, you 

can't lower the amount in controversy below $75,000 to 

get back to State court. At the time of removal, the 

Federal court both had jurisdiction over this case and 

it was clearly precluded under SLUSA. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and I 

understand your submission -- and perhaps it's distinct 

from the Seventh Circuit holding in this respect -- to 

suggest that those are different standards, the 

standard for removal and the standard for preclusion. 

MR. PERRY: Your Honor, I think we're the 

same as the Seventh Circuit. We may have articulated 

it slightly different, but yes, they are different 

standards. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that under your 

view at least, it's possible that you could have 

removal jurisdiction and then determine that the -- the 

case is not, in fact, preempted. 

MR. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And so that an 

entirely State law case would proceed in Federal court. 

MR. PERRY: Mr. Chief Justice, let me give 

you an example. The answer is yes.

 In a case in which there is removal 

jurisdiction because the defense is colorable, there 

may be a factual issue as to whether the in-connection-

with requirement is met. In 10b-5 cases, it's not 

uncommon that that is a factual question, not a legal 

question. The Federal court would then retain 

jurisdiction to decide that question on summary 

judgment, at trial, or whatever. It won't know until 

it finally disposes of the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there another 

instance in which we've upheld Federal court 

jurisdiction over a purely State law cause of action, 

apart from the Federal officer situation? 

MR. PERRY: You have the Federal officer 

situation and you have the FSIA, Foreign Sovereign 

Immunities Act situation, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But those are the 

only two. 

MR. PERRY: Correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this would be a 

pretty unusual creature that you're asking us to 

sanction. 

MR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. It would be 

precisely the same creature that happens every time 

Congress makes a case removable on the basis of a

Federal defense. Every time Congress does that, which 

is not very often, the Court has held that the 

colorable defense is sufficient to invest the Federal 

court with jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then, Mr. Perry, 

there's a whole case. See, what's peculiar about this 

is Congress says it's not really preemption. I think 

Justice Stevens pointed that out in Dabit. It is 

preclusion. It says this action shall not exist. 

Period. Not as a State claim, not as a Federal claim. 

And it wanted the Federal courts to monitor that 

determination. It surely didn't want -- if -- if the 

State claim is outside that preclusion, didn't want the 

Federal courts to sit and have a whole trial on what is 

a non-diverse, no Federal question case. I mean, it 

just seems -- if you're going to imagine what Congress 

wouldn't want in the Federal court, that would be it. 

MR. PERRY: Justice Ginsburg, three answers. 

First, Congress wanted Federal courts to make 

the decision, not monitor the decision. 

Second, we agree the Federal court has the 

power to remand the case. If all that's left is State 

law claims, the court doesn't have to keep it. 

And third, that is what -- the regime that 

Congress set up was designed because there is a risk of

error. Some district courts will get some SLUSA 

preclusion questions wrong. And the question before 

this Court really is would Congress have wanted those 

cases to stay in the Federal courts subject to Federal 

appellate review or --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But now there you must 

admit that you are departing from Judge Easterbrook 

because Judge Easterbrook said this statute gives the 

Federal court adjudicatory authority to do one thing, 

to decide whether there's preemption or preclusion or, 

if not, then to remand. So they make -- they make one 

determination and bow out he said. And you're telling 

us, no, they don't bow out. They can, if they want to, 

keep the State law claim and adjudicate it on the 

merits. 

MR. PERRY: Your Honor, Judge Easterbrook 

read section -- subsection (d)(4) to require remand. 

Petitioners and Respondent's are in agreement in this 

Court for the first time that (d)(4) does not apply to 

the remand in this case. It only applies to remands 

for expressly exempted actions. The -- (d)(4), it 

says, shall be remanded. 

The corollary to that, we would submit, is 

that where Congress recognizes that certain cases shall 

be remanded, even though they're within the removal

jurisdiction, other cases, such as this one, may be 

remanded. Otherwise, Congress could have said all 

cases that are not precluded shall be remanded. 

And -- and, Justice Ginsburg, it's not as 

counterintuitive as -- as I think Petitioners are 

trying to make it seem because there may be Federal 

issues that continue past the preclusion --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. I'm simply asking 

about the Seventh Circuit's understanding of the case. 

It says, after making the decision that 77p(b) 

requires, the district court has nothing else to do. 

Dismissal and remand are the only options. So Judge 

Easterbrook or the Seventh Circuit clearly did not 

think that there was any adjudication on the merits of 

a State law claim to be made. He said it twice. One 

is at 14a of the joint appendix, and the other is 11a. 

MR. PERRY: And, Justice Ginsburg, the reason 

he said that was because of -- of section -- subsection 

(d)(4), which is quoted in full at the top of page 12a 

of the petition appendix. That is because the Second 

Circuit had held that (d)(4) applies to remands in this 

situation, and both Petitioners and Respondent's in 

their Seventh Circuit briefing took that position. 

When we got to this Court and we both looked harder at 

the statutory scheme, we both realized that we were

wrong. Therefore, Judge Easterbrook -- you know, the 

one mistake he made was the one we led him into making. 

But that doesn't change the validity of his 

jurisdictional analysis, which is to say that the only 

requirement of SLUSA that goes to the jurisdiction on 

removal is whether this is a covered class action. The 

elements of the preclusion defense are then the 

substantive question of Federal law that Congress 

authorized the Federal court to make, and it authorized 

the Federal court to make final. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm confused now. You're 

saying both sides agreed that section 1447(d) does not 

apply? 

MR. PERRY: No, Justice Breyer. Both sides 

agree that SLUSA, section 77p(d)(4) --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, then --

then I understand that. 

What I don't understand is the question about 

something remaining to be done. What -- what 77p(b) 

says is the covered class action, I take it, is any 

private party alleging. And when I see the word 

alleging, I think you're supposed to look at the 

complaint to see what they allege, not some other thing 

about what's going to happen later. But you're telling 

me that's wrong.

 MR. PERRY: Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: And if you're right that 

that's wrong, I don't see how you could possibly get 

out of (c) in 1447(c) which talks about a decision 

before final judgment, that it lacks subject-matter 

jurisdiction. Because if you're right, then this is 

before final judgment, it lacks subject-matter 

jurisdiction. That's the end of your case. 

MR. PERRY: Justice Breyer, I disagree 

respectfully. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. You have to 

disagree with -- I guess -- go ahead. Disagree. I'd 

like to hear the answer. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. PERRY: If it is a covered class action, 

that is, 50 plaintiffs and so forth --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MR. PERRY: -- it is removable and within the 

subject-matter jurisdiction of the Federal courts so 

long as the defendant has presented, either on the 

complaint or in the removal papers, a colorable defense 

of preclusion. Only --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, which would have to be 

a colorable defense that there is an allegation by the 

plaintiff that falls within (b).

 MR. PERRY: An allegation by the plaintiff as 

elaborated on by the removal notice, if necessary, 

because where Congress has waived the well-pleaded 

complaint rule, the removal court will look beyond the 

four corners of the complaint to include affidavits and 

other materials provided by the defendant. That has 

always been held the case in -- in the rare instances 

where Congress has made a Federal defense removable. 

The Court said that in the Franchise Tax Board case, 

for example, and it's well supported by history from 

the 1870's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I don't think that any 

of those cases are comparable, in that the removed case 

is going to be tried someplace. 

Take a diversity case. The Federal court has 

to decide -- and it's removed -- whether the parties 

are really diverse. If it decides that they are really 

diverse, it keeps the case and it's adjudicated in 

Federal court. If it decides they're not, the case is 

adjudicated in the State court. 

But here, the determination is, is there a 

claim to be tried anyplace? And if there is preclusion 

under SLUSA, then it's not a question of, as Judge 

Easterbrook put a menu, where is -- it's not a where 

question. It's a whether question. And so that makes

-- makes SLUSA quite different from other cases where 

the -- the case is going to be tried someplace. Here, 

the decision to be made is, is this going to be tried 

or not? Is it -- is it a claim or is not a claim? 

MR. PERRY: I entirely agree with you, Judge 

-- Justice Ginsburg, and I think that supports Judge 

Easterbrook's opinion. 

In the where will it be tried case, the lack 

of appellate review is less important because the 

merits of the case will go to State court and up 

through the system, and any Federal issues can reach 

this case. 

In the SLUSA case, where the district court 

erroneously, as we know the district court erroneously 

did here, denies the preclusion and sends the case back 

to State court, that is a final determination of 

Federal law that we submit is not reviewable in State 

court and can't be reviewed by this Court up on review 

through the State system. So that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you say it is not --

why do you say that it cannot be examined in State 

court if there's no appeal in the Federal forum? 

MR. PERRY: Your Honor, this Court has always 

held and reiterated in the Munsingwear case that where 

a collateral estoppel attaches because an issue has

been fully and finally litigated in a court of 

competent jurisdiction between the same parties, that 

the availability of an appeal --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but the --

MR. PERRY: -- does affect collateral 

estoppel. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but -- but there is 

also exceptions to the rule of claim and issue 

preclusion, and when you don't have an opportunity to 

appeal because the system doesn't let you appeal, then 

you can say, Judge, don't give this preclusive effect. 

I did not have that full and fair opportunity because 

I was unable to appeal. And I think that that's a solid 

preclusion law. 

MR. PERRY: Justice Ginsburg, this Court has 

never held that an appeal is required to give 

collateral estoppel effect. Therefore, on remand, the 

court could -- the Madison County State court could 

give collateral estoppel effect. In fact, I expect 

Petitioners would argue precisely that. And no 

decision of this Court stands as a barrier to that. 

The Court would have to change preclusion law to say 

that the lack of an appeal is a prerequisite to an 

approval. I agree with you, Your Honor, that it can 

be taken into account by a court, but it does not --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And a Nassau County court 

could say, we're not going to treat that as preclusive. 

They didn't have a fair chance to appeal. And that 

would be all right. 

MR. PERRY: And if they came out the other 

way and said, I am going to treat it as preclusive, 

because the Supreme Court says you don't have to have a 

right to appeal, we'd be stuck with that. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you wouldn't be stuck 

with it. I mean, that would be a Federal preclusion 

decision and that would ultimately be reviewable here. 

MR. PERRY: That -- that decision would be 

reviewable here, Your Honor. It's an unnecessary 

multiple layers of appeals and going through the State 

system to decide a Federal question that Congress 

wanted to have decided in the Federal courts. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in any case, you said 

Easterbrook made only one mistake. 

MR. PERRY: Only one mistake. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he made another one 

when he said, it's now or never for appellate review. 

That preclusion question could come to this Court if it 

went -- the case went back and the Nassau County said, 

well, I'm going to follow the Federal court, I'm not 

going to -- at the end of the road, the preclusion

question would be open for this Court to review. 

MR. PERRY: I respectfully disagree with you, 

Justice Ginsburg. The -- if the State court gave 

preclusive effect to the Federal court judgment, the 

preclusion question would be open to question -- the 

collateral estoppel question would be open to review. 

But the substance of the remand order would not be. It 

would still be barred by 1447(d), if Petitioners are 

right, and this Court held exactly that in the Missouri 

Pacific Railroad case in 1896 and has never revisited 

that. So that we cannot get the SLUSA issue up back 

through the State system. 

Judge Easterbrook was exactly right. It is 

now or never, Your Honor. And Congress certainly could 

not have expected on an issue of this magnitude where 

it passed a law 3 years after the PSLRA --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now or never. The 

question is not can you -- is there an appeal or does 

1447(d) bar it. The question is whether an action 

under State law is preempted. 

And suppose this case had gone along in the 

Federal -- in the State court, and the defense of 

preclusion is made in the State court. The State court 

could certainly decide that question. Nobody removed 

it. So the State court has competence to decide that

question, doesn't it? 

MR. PERRY: Certainly, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And in -- this Court could 

decide it on review. 

MR. PERRY: In a non-removed case, yes. 

Petitioners' theory, though, is if this is a 1447(d) 

bar, and it was removed to Federal court, decided that 

it was not precluded by SLUSA and remanded it, this 

Court could not review it directly or indirectly, could 

not review the issue of SLUSA preclusion decided by the 

Federal court. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I don't understand 

that. Why can't it? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And your best case on that 

is Munsingwear? 

MR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. Our case on 

that, where the Court held exactly that, is Missouri 

Pacific Railroad v. Fitzgerald. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh, the Missouri Pacific 

case. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that a case where 

there was no possibility of reviewing the decision of 

the court of first instance?

MR. PERRY: On the merits of the final 

judgment in the case, correct, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And why --

JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, if -- I 

mean, it's awfully surprising -- I think that's why 

you're getting this resistance -- that there's an issue 

in a case, does -- is the -- the State action preempted 

or not. They've never had an appeal. So they get it 

tried. The whole case is tried out, and then the --

some State court says, in our opinion it is preempted. 

But they can't decide that. They can't decide it 

because there was a Federal judge who said the opposite 

in the same case before the case was final. 

MR. PERRY: Justice Breyer, I think the State 

court could decide that. It's not --

JUSTICE BREYER: And if they don't -- and if 

they refuse to decide it, why wouldn't this Court say, 

this is the same case? There is only one case. It 

isn't over yet, and we're reviewing that, and we think 

that district judge was wrong. We think that Federal 

district judge never read Dabit, which isn't surprising 

since it was decided after he wrote the opinion.

 MR. PERRY: Justice Breyer, we would 

certainly hope that if Petitioners were to prevail on 

the 1447(d) issue, this Court would make clear both 

that we could relitigate the question to State court and 

bring it to this Court. 

What we are saying is under the current state 

of this Court's law, laid out in our brief and not 

challenged in any regard by Petitioners, that is not 

obviously the case, so that we are left with the fact 

that a State court could give preclusive effect to an 

obviously wrong Federal judgment that could not be 

reviewed in this Court. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying we would 

have to overrule Missouri Pacific? 

MR. PERRY: I think you would have to clarify 

at least that Missouri Pacific does not apply to SLUSA 

removals and remands, Justice Souter. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is part of the dynamic 

here, Mr. Perry, that if this goes back to the State 

court, that affects the dynamics of the litigation 

because you now have a class action that has to 

proceed, and that a large part of the litigation 

strategy in these cases is determined by whether or not 

there's going to be a full trial on the merits of the 

class action to effect a settlement, and so forth, so

that Congress wanted to have this reviewed quickly and 

in the Federal courts? 

MR. PERRY: Correct, Your Honor. And --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? 

Because I hadn't, frankly, realized the importance you 

attach to the Missouri Pacific case. And the way you 

describe it as saying that the -- the State court 

cannot be held to have decided against a Federal right 

-- well, anyway, the -- the point is there are two 

things that are decided by the Federal court when it 

remands a case. One, there was no preemption, and two, 

therefore, there shall be a removal. 

Now, as I understood the principle underlying 

that case, the -- the correctness of the remand could 

not be reviewed. That's litigated. But could not the 

correctness of the reason given for the remand, namely 

there was no preemption, be removed by us on 

certiorari? 

MR. PERRY: Not under Petitioners' theory, 

Your Honor, because their theory is that the inquiries 

are completely and totally coextensive. That the 

jurisdictional inquiry, the -- the remand inquiry is 

precisely the same as the preclusion inquiry. Our 

position is that --

seems to me very strange to say that we could not, when 

we do get the case on a petition for certiorari --

couldn't review whether it was -- whether it was in 

fact preemption. 

MR. PERRY: Your Honor, I'd submit that it's 

very strange that this would not be just reviewable 

straight up through the Federal system, as Judge 

Easterbrook and the Seventh Circuit correctly held. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the reason is 

there are two separate questions. They just happen to 

be identical. But I mean, the State court isn't going 

to worry about whether removal is appropriate or not. 

It doesn't have to answer that question, but it may 

well have to answer the question whether it's 

preempted. It happens to be the same analysis, at 

least under a reading of the statute, but that doesn't 

meant that you -- that just because a review of the 

removal decision -- the remand decision is -- is 

precluded, that review of the preemption decision is 

precluded. 

MR. PERRY: Your Honor, that -- that may well 

be a fair distinction of the Missouri Pacific case. We 

come to the Court today with the law as it stands and 

not knowing whether such a distinction will be drawn in 

the future --

MR. PERRY: -- the Seventh Circuit. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose -- suppose the -- it

The district court judge remands the case. In his 

opinion Romania is not a country. That's what he 

thinks. Never heard of it. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: So -- so it goes back to the 

State court and the State court says, yes, that's 

right. We've not heard of Romania either. It's not a 

country. 

All right. Now, you're saying there we are 

for all time. Everybody is stuck with this holding. 

MR. PERRY: Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? Maybe that's 

why I'm so surprised that such could be the law. 

MR. PERRY: If -- if it works the same way 

with SLUSA, such could be the law. The Court certainly 

has the opportunity to clarify that. 

Again, I'll return to the simpler way --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're -- you're positing 

a -- a State court that's going to, by golly, give that 

Federal decision preclusive effect even though, say, 

the Restatement of Judgments says -- now if a decision

didn't -- if there was no opportunity for review, then 

that's a ground for refusing preclusive effect. 

MR. PERRY: And in -- and in Munsingwear, 

Your Honor, the United States cited that precise 

provision of the Restatement of Judgments to this 

Court, and six Justices of this Court held, no, if 

there's no appeal, we are still going to give this 

judgment collateral estoppel effect. Certainly a State 

court would not be unreasonable in following this 

Court's lead, since this Court has never retreated from 

that statement. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Munsingwear was 

about mootness. 

MR. PERRY: Your Honor, it was about mootness 

and the result of the -- the Government's complaint 

there was that it was going to have to live with the 

collateral estoppel effects of the judgment. One of 

the arguments they made was, well, because we can't get 

an appeal, we won't be bound, and the Court disagreed 

with that en route to saying, and to avoid that 

problem, precisely that problem, you should have asked 

for vacatur. But since the Solicitor General didn't do 

it, the Court -- the decision stood and it had 

collateral estoppel effect. That -- that is the 

holding of Munsingwear, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But in -- in any case, 

Munsingwear turned on -- not on the availability of --

of an appeal generally, but on the mootness of the 

case. In other words, Munsingwear said, look, your 

case disappeared, and the -- the only way to get rid of 

the order you don't like is -- is vacatur. And if you 

didn't take that opportunity to get rid of it, then the 

-- the decision that was made survives, and that gets 

preclusive effect. It -- it doesn't -- Munsingwear 

would not apply of its own force in this case. 

MR. PERRY: Well, Munsingwear reaffirmed 

Johnson v. Wharton which said that where Congress takes 

away the right to appeal, there is still collateral 

estoppel effect of the district court judgment. That 

-- that was the previous decision that Munsingwear 

affirmed. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But not if the litigant 

asks to have it vacated under Munsingwear, the litigant 

would be entitled to have it vacated. So it was a foot 

fault and the -- the Court held the counsel to the 

mistake that had been made. 

MR. PERRY: Your Honor, the -- the holding of 

Munsingwear is that Johnson v. Wharton is good law, and 

a court need not give -- may give preclusive effect to 

a case without an appeal.

we come to this case. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if you -- on 

the removal question, if there's a dispute about 

whether it's a covered class action, dispute about the 

number of people involved, the dollar amount, I take it 

that is litigated at the jurisdictional stage? 

MR. PERRY: Correct, Your Honor. I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. But you say 

that when it gets to whether it's a -- there's a --

involving a covered security, for some reason that 

can't be litigated at the jurisdictional stage. 

MR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. That is the 

merits determination. And -- and the statute tracks --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. No or 

yes? That that is not litigated at the jurisdictional 

stage? 

MR. PERRY: That the preclusive elements are 

the merits question of the case, not the jurisdictional 

question. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that? There 

-- it's the same clause. What you can remove is a 

covered class action involving a covered security. So

why do we have such different approaches to the 

different prongs? 

MR. PERRY: Your Honor, I'm agreeing with you 

on covered security. I'm -- I'm saying that there then 

is the further inquiry of whether all of the preclusive 

elements of subsection 77p(b) are met, which is the 

merits inquiry. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And --

MR. PERRY: There -- there are very few cases 

that don't involve covered securities because virtually 

every security is covered. There are very few cases 

that aren't covered class actions because if they 

involve more than 50 people, that's about all the 

requirement there is. Those are the jurisdictional 

prerequisites. That, if established, gives the court 

subject-matter jurisdiction. 

Then we have the substantive elements of the 

SLUSA preclusion defense provided in a different 

statute that is not jurisdictional, just like this 

Court described in Arbaugh. The covered security and 

covered class action Congress made jurisdictional by 

putting them in the statute. The substantive elements 

of the defense Congress did not make jurisdictional 

because they're in another statute. 

That's the disconnect that Judge Easterbrook

understood so that on the face of the opinion of the 

district court, where it recites the defendants 

maintain that the in-connection-with requirement was 

met, that defense, if colorable -- and it clearly was. 

This Court has accepted it in Dabit -- conferred 

jurisdiction on the court, and then the substantive 

decision on the merits was the merits determination. 

That is the decoupling that Congress did in SLUSA, that 

Judge Easterbrook correctly recognized, and that puts 

this case squarely within the Thermtron exception to 

1447(d). 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you answer the 

argument, the third argument, that Mr. Frederick 

stressed that is, that Congress provided specifically 

in the Class Action Fairness Act, a couple of other 

acts, and 1447 itself with respect to civil rights 

actions removable under 1443? In all those cases, it 

provided specifically for review of remand decisions, 

and here the silence is deafening. 

MR. PERRY: In those cases, Your Honor, they 

work differently than SLUSA for two reasons. One, 

they're the whether -- not whether it will be tried, 

but where it will be tried. And when Congress -- and 

when it was only a where question, Congress puts in a 

specific provision.

 The other is CAFA, for example, is expressly 

jurisdictional. It amends the diversity statute. So 

there's no argument that it would be within Thermtron. 

Every CAFA question is a 1447(c) issue. Congress had 

to make it. 

Here, Congress knew about Thermtron. 

Congress has known about Thermtron for 30 years. This 

Court reaffirmed Thermtron while they were debating 

SLUSA. And Congress knew that this question was not 

jurisdictional. Congress decoupled them, just as this 

Court described in Arbaugh. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't know what -- what 

Congress' knowledge about Thermtron was a district 

judge who said, they removed this case, but I'm much 

too busy. This court is much too busy to mess with 

stuff that belongs in the State court. I'm remanding 

it. That was just too much, and the Federal court --

MR. PERRY: And, Justice Ginsburg, if Judge 

Hermansdorfer had said, I'm much too busy and therefore 

I lack subject-matter jurisdiction, it is inconceivable 

that the Thermtron case would have been decided any 

differently. Congress understands the difference 

between jurisdiction and merits. This Court 

understands the difference between jurisdiction and 

merits. Judge Easterbrook certainly understood that

distinction. This determination made by the district 

court here was a merits determination not controlled by 

1447(c), and therefore, appeal was not barred by 

1447(d). 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but I still 

don't -- and this gets back to the question I asked 

before. I mean, subsection (c) of 77p -- it's 

unfortunate we've got a lot of subsection (c)'s here 

but -- of -- of SLUSA incorporates subsection (b). 

MR. PERRY: No, Your Honor. It references 

subsection (b). 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it says what 

can be removed is the covered class action involving a 

covered security, as set forth in subsection (b). 

MR. PERRY: Just as title VII says what can 

be brought is an action under this title or just as the 

environmental statute in Steel Company said what can be 

brought is an action under subsection (a). 

The cross reference of another provision 

containing substantive elements of Federal law does not 

make those elements jurisdictional. That's the holding 

of Arbaugh. That's the holding of Steel Company. 

There's no reason that the same principle shouldn't be 

applied when Congress makes a Federal defense removable 

as when it makes a Federal claim subject to suit within

the original jurisdiction of the Federal courts. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but here, what is set 

out in subsection (b) is exactly the reason for 

Congress' wanting to place these restrictions on it, 

and that, it seems to me, is the sensible reason for 

reading it the way your -- your brother on the other 

side does. 

MR. PERRY: Well, Justice Souter, we know 

from Mesa that if Congress had just made all covered 

class actions removable, we would have to find some 

Federal defense to support article III jurisdiction. 

Congress, by cross-referencing subsection (b), just 

pointed the Federal courts to the particular Federal 

defense that is sufficient, clearly sufficient, to make 

article III satisfied under the Mesa case. That's all 

that that cross reference is doing. 

It's not, however, picking up every element. 

If Congress wanted to include every element of title 

VII, that environmental statute of SLUSA, it would have 

put them in the jurisdictional provision. Arbaugh says 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why would it have 

done that? That would have been a waste of time. I 

mean, you just say, as set forth in subsection (b). 

You're saying if they had repeated subsection (b)

there, we'd have -- the case would come out the other 

way? 

MR. PERRY: Yes, Your Honor. We have not 

only the -- the reference there, but we have the final 

sentence of that clause where we say after removal, 

after the court establishes that it has removal 

jurisdiction, it shall subject the action to subsection 

(b). That clause is entirely redundant under 

Petitioners' reading of the statute. Entirely 

redundant. I've read the reply brief a number of 

times. I don't understand their explanation for that. 

The only explanation is that Congress made 

removability contingent on the subsection (c) factors. 

Thank you, Your Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Perry. 

Mr. Frederick, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID FREDERICK 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. FREDERICK: Thank you. I think it's 

really important for you to look at the complaints in 

these cases because every single one of them asserts 

claims on the basis of negligence and the value -- the 

fair-value pricing of the securities. They are not 

based on misrepresentations. The other side has 

attempted to make them look like misrepresentations,

and they've quoted things out of context in order to do 

so. But the complaints themselves are pure negligence 

claims that would fall outside of SLUSA. 

But even if you were to disagree with that 

and even if you were to disagree with the district 

court's basis for saying that remand was proper because 

it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, the general rule 

of Thermtron, Things Remembered, and importantly, the 

Gravitt case applies. And this Court does not have 

appellate jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit does not 

have appellate jurisdiction because of the plain 

language of section 1447(d). 

Respondents concede that State courts can 

decide SLUSA questions. It is up to defendants to 

decide whether to try to remove them. And subsection 

(d), about which Mr. Perry spoke, expressly provides 

that certain kinds of securities actions shall be 

remanded because Congress was not so concerned that 

Federal courts decide everything concerning securities 

cases, but only as to those that are expressly set 

forth in subsection (b). 

And, Mr. Chief Justice, respectfully, what 

subsection (c) is doing with its references to 

subsection (b) are to incorporate those criteria as one 

of the three elements or criteria for removability. It

has to be a covered security, has to be a covered class 

action, and it has to meet the requisites of subsection 

(b). That's the only reasonable way to read that. And 

the last clause is simply confirmatory that if those 

are -- are met, then the district court has to find 

that the case shall be precluded. 

In the Gravitt case, in which this Court 

through a per curiam dismissed the appeal, there was a 

dispute between the district court and the court of 

appeals over whether the district court had properly 

applied subject-matter jurisdiction principles in 

deciding whether or not there was diversity. This 

Court said, no matter. That is outside the -- the 

requisite -- that is outside 1447(d), and the general 

rule against appealability applies. 

Now, importantly, they argue that they would 

be precluded by -- from arguing against SLUSA 

preemption in State court, but in fact, the last brief 

-- the last page of our brief, our reply brief, cites 

the Standefer case in which this Court held, under 

contemporary principles -- and I'm quoting now -- under 

contemporary principles of collateral estoppel, the 

inability to pursue an appeal is a factor strongly 

militating against giving a judgment preclusive effect. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you agree that there

would be Federal court review in this Court from a 

State court determination on the applicability of SLUSA 

in this case? 

MR. FREDERICK: Yes, there would be. And 

there would be -- their argument about the Missouri 

Pacific case is wrong because what the -- what was 

going on there was the remand determination, not the 

underlying Federal right. And that's what would be 

appealed, and there would also be appeal of the 

preclusive consequences because that would be a 

question of Federal law under this Court's longstanding 

determination. The Restatement --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you one question, 

Mr. Frederick? Because it's important to me. 

Would you agree that a complaint that alleged 

that the defendant negligently used or employed 

manipulative devices and so forth would be covered by 

SLUSA -- would preempt it? 

MR. FREDERICK: That would be covered. And 

-- and the reason is that it is -- involved a 

manipulation. The wording of SLUSA involves a 

manipulation of -- of the security. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: So the mere fact that it's 

negligently caused would not preclude preclusion. 

MR. FREDERICK: What -- what we're talking

about here, Justice Stevens -- it's important -- is 

that in how these securities get priced, was there 

negligence in the pricing of those, that had 

deleterious effects on one class of holders but not on 

market-timers that we were moving in and out of the 

market. 

And so, frankly, Judge Easterbrook was wrong 

for a sixth reason, and that was in saying that there 

would have been a derivative claim here too because a 

derivative case has to be brought on behalf of the 

corporation on behalf of all shareholders --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then the district court was 

wrong too I guess because the district court made the 

same --

MR. FREDERICK: The district court was wrong 

in not anticipating what this Court held in Dabit, but 

it was not wrong insofar as it held that there was no 

subject-matter jurisdiction because this case is based 

on negligence and not fraud. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

Frederick. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
