 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

this morning in case 06-856, LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg & 

Associates.

 Mr. Stris.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. STRIS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 Let me begin with the first question on 

which this Court has granted certiorari. Sections 

502(a)(2) and 409 of ERISA permit restoration of "any 

losses to the plan."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What are the code numbers 

of those? I really get confused with you people who 

work with ERISA all the time -- can refer, you know 

Section 3 of ERISA. I use the code. What -- what code 

sections are you talking about?

 MR. STRIS: I never thought the day would 

come, Justice Scalia, when I was described as working 

with ERISA all of the time, but I will tell you the code 

provision. The code provision is -- for 502(a)(2) of 

ERISA -- is 29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(2). It's found on page 

10a of the blue brief. Section 409 of ERISA is 29

U.S.C. 1109, and I was quoting specifically from 

1109(a), and that is found on page 9a of the blue brief.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Thank you.

 MR. STRIS: Now, the statute plainly states 

that "any losses to the plan" may be recovered if they 

were caused by fiduciary breach. Our position on the 

(a)(2) question is straightforward. The plain meaning 

of "any losses to the plan" includes any diminution in 

value of defined contribution plan assets, regardless of 

the number of participants ultimately affected.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the plan itself 

is nowhere in the record, is that right?

 MR. STRIS: Well, the summary plan 

description was attached to the complaint.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, the summary. 

And I looked at the summary and saw nowhere the rules 

about investment options, what you get to choose, how 

often -- and for all we know, the plan might say you 

have no choice about investment options, it's all going 

to be invested in T-bills or whatever.

 MR. STRIS: Respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice, 

that's not true. I would point your attention to page 

19a of the appendix to the brief in opposition. And 

this is the page of the summary plan description that 

makes clear that participants in the plan like Mr. LaRue

will have the opportunity to direct their investments.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that wasn't in the 

record.

 MR. STRIS: It is in the record.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is in the record.

 MR. STRIS: Yes. And to be clear, Justice 

Scalia --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where in the record 

is it?

 MR. STRIS: It is page 19a of the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, that's in the 

opposition to certiorari, and I don't believe that's in 

the record.

 MR. STRIS: It is in the record; it was 

attached to the complaint that was filed by Mr. LaRue in 

this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, that's the 

summary of the plan.

 MR. STRIS: The summary plan description, 

that's correct. And as you know, Mr. Chief Justice, if 

there is a conflict between the summary plan description 

and the plan, the summary plan description governs; it's 

a legitimate document.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The summary on the 

page you mentioned says that you will be able to -- you

have certain investment choices are available to you, 

and that the administrator will provide you with 

information on what they are and how you can change it.

 MR. STRIS: That is correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we don't know 

those details, correct?

 MR. STRIS: That's true, but this case was 

decided at the pleading stage. And so to be clear, we 

alleged that the right given to Mr. LaRue under the plan 

was violated. If true, then that would constitute a 

fiduciary breach.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would also 

presumably more obviously constitute a breach of the 

plan, correct?

 MR. STRIS: Yes, that's correct; and that is 

a fiduciary breach. Under 404 (a)(1)(D), failure to act 

in accordance with the terms of the plan is a classic 

example of breach of fiduciary duty.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your position is 

anything that is remediable, if that's a word, under 

(a)(1) can also be pursued under (a)(2)?

 MR. STRIS: No, that is not my position. My 

position --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Let me step back. 

Do you agree that you could bring an action under (a)(1)

for this breach of the plan?

 MR. STRIS: I think that's far from clear, 

but what is clear is that we could not recover what we 

wanted under (a)(1). (a)(1) only permits a lawsuit 

against the plan. Here the plan doesn't have the funds 

that are relevant.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does it say that 

(a)(1) is available only against the plan?

 MR. STRIS: The specific language of (a)(1) 

doesn't state that. It states that you can get benefits 

due under the plan, or you can enforce your rights under 

the plan. I'm not aware of a single case, Justice 

Ginsburg, where an (a)(1)(B) action has been permitted 

to recover personally from a fiduciary. That is the 

purpose of (a)(2), which specifically states that you 

can personally recover from a fiduciary.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine, so why doesn't 

he proceed first under (a)(1)(B), against the plan?

 MR. STRIS: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Because the plan owes him 

this money. And if the plan turns around and says well, 

you know the fiduciary didn't invest your funds the way 

it was supposed to, the plan still owes him the money, 

doesn't it?

 MR. STRIS: I think the answer to that -- I

think there are two reasons why that's incorrect. And 

the first reason is 502 (a)(2), unlike 502(a)(3), is not 

a catchall provision, so if he has a remedy under 

502(a)(2) --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm talking about 

(a)(1)(B).

 MR. STRIS: Right. And it is -- there is 

nothing to suggest that that provision is mutually 

exclusive with another provision. So my first response 

to your question, Justice Scalia, is that even if he 

could have proceeded under (a)(1)(B), there is nothing 

to suggest that he had to, if he wanted to proceed under 

the express terms of (a)(2).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, there is -- there is 

this to suggest that only -- only that manner of 

proceeding preserves the structure of -- of the 

legislation which is that you're supposed to first apply 

to the plan and exhaust your remedies there before you 

come into court; and interpreting it that way would 

preserve that -- that exhaustion requirement. You have 

to apply to the plan first, and if you establish that 

the plan owes you money, then it's a loss to the plan 

and you can sue in court.

 MR. STRIS: Well, what I would say to that, 

Justice Scalia, and is that this administrative

exhaustion requirement that you're referring to is a 

judicial gloss on the statute. I find it hard to 

believe that the express terms of (a)(2), which the 

plain language authorizes restoration to the plan of any 

losses to the plan for any breach of duty --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your approach, if 

can you go under (a)(2) -- you're right that we 

judicially have developed a number of glosses on (a)(1), 

including I think most importantly the Firestone 

deference principle. But if you're right that you can 

go under (a)(2), then all of that work has been in vain. 

You can avoid all the limitations on (a)(1) just by 

saying we want the same relief under (a)(2).

 MR. STRIS: I would not agree with that 

characterization because there are very few cases where 

the specific conditions for (a)(2) are met. You would 

need to prove a loss to the plan. In welfare plan 

cases, for example, you would not be able to proceed 

under (a)(2) because you would never be able to show 

that the fiduciary breach caused a loss to the plan.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You told me earlier 

that any breach of the plan was a fiduciary duty.

 MR. STRIS: That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now you're -- the --

what is it -- the obverse or the converse of that you're

saying is not true.

 MR. STRIS: No, that's not true. There are 

two requirements for an (a)(2) action. One is that 

there be a fiduciary breach. That's what you just spoke 

to when you referred to a breach of the term of the 

plan. But there's a second important requirement which 

goes to the heart of why (a)(2) is what it is. There 

must be a loss to the plan. This Court recognizes --

JUSTICE ALITO: Could I ask you whether the 

(a)(2) argument would be available to you on remand even 

if we agree with your interpretation of that provision? 

Didn't Judge Wilkinson say pretty clearly that the 

argument had been waived? He said, "even if the 

argument were not therefore waived." Doesn't that mean 

that it was waived?

 MR. STRIS: I don't read the Fourth 

Circuit's decision that way. I read it as -- as dicta, 

not an alternative holding. And to be clear, the 

Respondents concede that point on page 5 of their brief 

in opposition, and I quote. They state: "After 

suggesting this claim may have been waived" and then 

they proceed. So even Respondent agrees that it was 

merely dicta --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, maybe -- maybe they've 

waived the waiver, but Judge Wilkinson is a careful

writer, and if you use the subjunctive there -- "even if 

the argument were not therefore waived" -- doesn't that 

mean it was in fact waived?

 MR. STRIS: Not in my opinion, but that's an 

issue that the Fourth Circuit and the lower courts will 

need to resolve. If they interpret their opinion as 

having held that, certainly we would be precluded. I 

don't think that that is what they held, and I think we 

have a very strong argument that we pled a 502(a)(2) 

claim as required under the Federal rules.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me come back to your 

earlier point that the second requirement of (a)(2) --

it's actually a requirement of 1109 --

MR. STRIS: That's correct. Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- is not met. And that is 

-- that is to -- to make good to such plan any losses to 

the plan resulting from each such breach. In these 

welfare plans, if you sue the plan, claiming some 

welfare benefits that haven't been provided, wouldn't 

the plan have to provide those benefits?

 MR. STRIS: Yes. That is a classic action 

under (a)(1)(B), Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that would be a loss to 

the plan.

 MR. STRIS: No. I don't agree with that

characterization. In a defined benefit plan of which a 

welfare plan is the classic example --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. STRIS: -- there are no assets that you 

have an entitlement to as a beneficiary.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I have an entitlement to 

certain -- certain welfare payments.

 MR. STRIS: That's -- you have entitlement 

to a contractually provided benefit. So, if there is a 

fiduciary breach in terms of the administrator stating, 

"We're not going to give you this cancer treatment that 

really was provided under plan" --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. STRIS: Or, "we're not going to give you 

this drug" --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. STRIS: -- that breach doesn't cause any 

diminution in value in plan assets.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It does if you sue the plan 

and require the plan to pay what the plan has committed 

to pay, whereupon the plan would have a right of action 

against the fiduciary, I assume, for the fiduciary's 

failure to do what he was supposed to.

 MR. STRIS: Well, that may be true, but with 

respect, I think that that is -- that's the tail wagging

the dog. The argument that you made is that a loss 

occurs if your fiduciary duty claim is successful. 

That's another statute. That's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but that would 

preserve the necessity of going through the exhaustion 

requirement first. You apply to the plan and say the 

plan owes me this cancer treatment, and the plan says 

"yes, we do" or "no, we don't." If it says "yes, we 

do," it's liable to you and then the plan can -- can 

recover over against the trustee.

 MR. STRIS: Let me take a step back because 

I think we are 100 percent in agreement, but I want to 

be clear what our position is. Under the factual 

scenario that you described, I agree with you 100 

percent that you would need to proceed under (a)(1)(B), 

because you would be requesting a benefit that you are 

entitled to under the plan.

 In this case, the only benefit that you are 

entitled to, if you are a participant in an individual 

account plan, is the value of the contributions that 

you've put or your employer has put into the account, as 

they have either appreciated or depreciated. So my 

first response -- it's actually the second response I 

was going to give earlier that I never got to is that I 

believe that it's not clear that there is even a

legitimate (a)(1)(B) claim that Mr. LaRue could have 

asserted here because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it isn't just if the 

money is payable to him today. It says, "to enforce his 

rights under the terms or to clarify his rights to 

future benefits under the terms of the plan."

 MR. STRIS: That is correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And if there's no money in 

his account, it seems to me he could bring an action to 

clarify that even if there is no money in his account 

the plan owes him future benefits in that amount.

 MR. STRIS: And then one of two things at 

that point would happen, Justice Scalia. Either he 

would get paid by the plan, which would pick the pockets 

of the other participants and require the plan to then 

bring an action under (a)(2) --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. STRIS: -- which is perfectly 

legitimate, but my response to that is there is no 

language in the statute to suggest that that is 

required. If he has an action to do that directly under 

(a)(2), there's no language in the statute to suggest 

that he need bring an (a)(1) action first and require 

the plan to then proceed under (a)(2).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- I'm not sure

about your characterization that he would pick the 

pockets of the other plan participants. By definition 

he only prevails if this was a benefit to which he was 

entitled under the plan. So that doesn't seem unfair to 

the other plan participants.

 MR. STRIS: Well, a defined contribution 

plan is nothing more than a collection of assets that 

have been allocated to a group of participants. So, if 

those assets are depleted through fiduciary breach, 

which is what occurred here, and you bring a claim 

saying that your interest in the plan was depleted, if 

you brought that claim against the plan, the plan no 

longer has the money. So either they can pay you --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it may or may 

not have the money. You could have failed to follow his 

instructions in a way that enriched the plan, and it's 

simply a question of getting that money properly 

allocated rather than improperly allocated to the other 

plan participants who are picking the pocket of your 

client.

 MR. STRIS: Well, I think under the example 

that you just gave, Mr. Chief Justice, there would not 

be a loss to the plan.

 Our fundamental argument about the plain 

text of this statute is that a loss to the plan is a

diminution in plan assets. If I'm a participant in a 

plan, and the administrator doesn't like me and takes my 

money and allocates it, just because they feel like it, 

to another participant in the plan, it is not our 

position that there would be a claim under (a)(2) 

because there has been no diminution in plan assets. 

One would need to proceed under (a)(3).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the plan wouldn't 

necessarily pay out any money. What would happen is, 

after the administrative determination by the plan that 

it does owe the money, he would sue the plan for the 

money and the plan would implead the trustee who was 

responsible for this. It ends up the same way.

 MR. STRIS: Well, I would say two things 

about that. First, it may end up the same way depending 

on how the facts play out, which is the perfect evidence 

for my point, which is 502(a)(3) of ERISA has been 

interpreted as a catchall provision. 502(a)(2) is 

anything but. It sets forth very specific conditions 

and very specific relief that is available if those 

conditions are met. There is nothing to suggest that 

the availability of a potential remedy under (a)(1) 

precludes a remedy under (a)(2).

 Now, my second response, Justice Scalia, is 

that depending on how the facts play out, the result may

not be as you suggest. The plan may choose not to go 

after the fiduciary, and if that's the case, all -- at 

most my client could get is a declaration under (a)(1) 

that doesn't ultimately get him any money.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What would happen if the 

trustee does not have the money? The trustee not only 

squandered your client's money; he squandered his own. 

He's just really in bad shape. He has no money to cough 

up. What happens to your client? Doesn't your client 

get that money from the plan anyway?

 MR. STRIS: I think that that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: By picking, as you put it, 

by picking the pockets of the other plan participants?

 MR. STRIS: I think in an individual account 

plan, that presents a very difficult question.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's the answer to it?

 MR. STRIS: I think probably he would not be 

able to recover that money. I think that money would be 

lost and he would have no remedy because, at that point 

in time, someone is going to lose. Either my client is 

not going to recover money that he is entitled to or 

other participants in the plan are going to have money 

taken away from them.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They participated in the 

plan. It was a failure of the trustee for the plan. It

MR. STRIS: I don't think there's any 

evidence for that. ERISA imposes a duty of loyalty to 

all plan participants. If they breach a fiduciary duty 

which causes a diminution in plan assets that ultimately 

will affect only one participant, there is -- it goes 

against the very core of ERISA to say that they can 

remedy that by taking money from innocent fellow 

participants. And that really goes to the core of the 

difference between an (a)(2) claim and an (a)(3) claim 

on one hand, and an (a)(1) claim on the other hand.

 One thing is clear here. Whether or not 

Mr. LaRue could have brought an (a)(1)(B) claim, it 

would not under any circumstances have resulted in 

getting money from the fiduciary back into the plan. 

Absent money being returned to the plan, there can be no 

meaningful remedy for the breach that occurred.

 So it returns us to the core question in 

this case, which is were the terms of (a)(2) satisfied?

 Now, the court of appeals basically advanced 

two arguments as to why the plain text of the statute 

should be ignored. The primary argument was a 

fundamental misinterpretation of this Court's opinion in 

Russell. So I'd like to speak about that.

JUSTICE ALITO: If we agree to you on 

(a)(2), is there any need to get to (a)(3)?

 MR. STRIS: Certainly if you agree with us 

on (a)(2), the court of appeals can be reversed on that 

issue. We ask that you also reach the (a)(3) question, 

because this case was decided at the pleading stage.

 Although it may be unlikely, there are two 

reasons why we might need to avail ourselves of (a)(3) 

on remand. The first is that facts could develop. I 

don't have any reason to believe they will, but facts 

could develop where there is a loss to Mr. LaRue's 

beneficial interest but not a loss to the plan. In 

other words, they took his money and they gave it to 

someone else.

 We should be able to plead, if we have a 

cognizable claim under two statutes, both of them and 

then discover the relevant facts.

 The second reason why you should reach the 

(a)(3) question is additional relief may be available 

under (a)(3) that is not available under (a)(2).

 JUSTICE ALITO: What would that be?

 MR. STRIS: Well, our theory of surcharge, 

and it's also the government's theory, is that surcharge 

is a make-whole remedy for pecuniary losses that are 

caused by a breach of trust. It is clear that the core

losses are diminution in trust assets or failure of 

trust assets to appreciate. But there are individual 

pecuniary losses that were historically remediable under 

surcharge.

 For example, if you paid out of pocket for 

an auditor to figure out what the extent of a fiduciary 

breach was, a premerger court of equity would not only 

surcharge your harm, the harm to your interest in the 

trust, but they also would return to you the money that 

you spent for that audit.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your own 

argument was that (a)(3) is the catchall. So if (a)(2), 

which is described as very precise, if that's 

applicable, you would not get to (a)(3). You would be 

asking us at this point to assume that somehow the 

(a)(2) case folds, and then we flip over into (a)(3).

 But why should we get there prematurely? It 

seems to me if it's right that (a)(2) comes before 

(a)(3), it isn't -- it's not quite a ripeness issue, but 

it's close to that.

 MR. STRIS: Well, the Court certainly may 

choose not to reach the (a)(3) issue, so I can't speak 

to that. But what I can say is that the dicta in Varity 

that describes (a)(3) as a catchall provision -- it is 

clear that at the end of the day if the release is

coterminous under the two provisions, it would not be 

appropriate for us to proceed under (a)(3).

 But that is not a pleading question. My 

position as to why you should reach (a)(3) is if we have 

a cognizable theory under (a)(2) and (a)(3), and we 

believe we do, we shouldn't be required to choose at 

this point in time if, as the litigation proceeds, it 

turns out that the relief we would be entitled to is 

coterminous, then we concede it would not be appropriate 

to proceed under (a)(3).

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

 SUPPORTING PETITIONER

 MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 ERISA authorizes a participant in a defined 

contribution plan to sue to recover losses to the plan 

caused by a fiduciary breach even if the losses are 

attributable to the participant's individual plan 

account.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that means every 

participant, right? In other words, for the failure of

the plan to follow this individual's instructions, any 

participant in the plan can bring suit under (a)(2)?

 MR. ROBERTS: It's -- that's theoretically 

possible because the loss to the -- loss to this 

individual account is a loss to the plan. Although it's 

unlikely that a participant that has no -- that is --

whose own benefits are not going to be affected has much 

incentive to sue, and it's also possible that a court 

might conclude if such a participant did bring suit, 

that such a suit shouldn't proceed under prudential 

standing principles or because the suit wouldn't be 

appropriate, but here --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't the theory be that 

if ultimately the other accounts could be robbed to sort 

of make up for at least part of the loss of this one, 

that for a loss to any account is a threat to all the 

others?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, we agree that a loss to 

any account is a threat to the plan as a whole, but I 

think for a different reason. We don't think that you 

could rob the other accounts to pay this -- this 

participant. That would likely violate the fiduciary's 

duty of loyalty to those participants, the fiduciary 

duty of prudence under -- under ERISA.

 It would also probably violate the terms of

the plan, because they have a right to future benefits 

by the amount that's in their allocation but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Roberts, Section (a), 

(a)(1)(B) --

MR. ROBERTS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Unlike Section (a)(2), 

which refers you to 1109, does not say who gets sued. 

Under 1109 it's clear who gets sued. It's the fiduciary 

who gets sued. I find it very curious that (a)(1)(B) 

just says a civil action may be brought to recover 

benefits due to him under the terms of his plans or to 

clarify his right under the terms of the plan.

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think the implication 

there is that the suit -- the suit is against the plan.

 MR. ROBERTS: The implication is that the 

suit is against the plan or against a fiduciary in --

under (a)(1)(B). Against the plan or against the 

fiduciary whose initial capacity is representative of 

the plan.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where?

 MR. ROBERTS: If you can't sue the fiduciary 

under (a)(1)(B), that just reinforces the point even --

even more, Your Honor, that Petitioner's cause of action 

here arises under (a)(2) because he is seeking relief

for the plan not relief from the plan.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It may well. But I'm just 

talking right now of (a)(1)(B), and it would seem to me 

that the logical reading of that is that the suit is 

against the plan.

 MR. ROBERTS: Under (a)(1)(B), most courts 

require that the suit be brought against the plan. I 

think the suit in certain circumstances could be brought 

against the fiduciary to require the fiduciary to take 

action that is required by the terms of the plan such as 

if you fought against the fiduciary to pay benefits out.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we know that 

this is a breach of fiduciary duty under (a)(2) without 

having the plan before us? In other words, it may not 

be a fiduciary obligation to follow an instruction from 

somebody if the plan provides a different way in which 

those instructions are going to be handled.

 I'd say, as I think a lot of these plans do, 

you can change your investment options only during a 

particular period. Well, if the instruction came at a 

different time, it wouldn't be a breach of fiduciary 

duties because it wasn't a breach of the plan.

 MR. ROBERTS: And if it's not a breach of 

fiduciary duties, Petitioner will lose on the merits or 

on remand in their motion for summary judgment based on

facts that could be decided.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought his 

argument -- his argument reduces to the fact that it's a 

breach of fiduciary duty because it's a breach of the 

plan. But if not a breach of the plan, then it's not a 

breach --

MR. ROBERTS: It's a breach of fiduciary 

duty both of a failure to follow the terms of the plan 

and a breach of the duty of prudence, because when a 

plan provides that participants can direct their 

investments --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we need to know 

-- we need to know what the plan provides before we can 

decide.

 MR. ROBERTS: The case was dismissed on the 

pleadings, Your Honor, and it alleges that there was a 

breach of fiduciary duty. And Respondent hasn't 

disputed, in fact, that the plan requires 

participants -- allows participants direct, in fact --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The pleadings don't 

include the plan. So we have to assess the pleadings 

without the terms of the plan.

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, but the inferences 

shouldn't be construed against the plaintiff in motion 

to dismiss on the pleadings, Your Honor.

In addition to that, Respondent's answer --

this is on page 2a of the red brief -- admitted that 

participants in the DeWolff plan are permitted to direct 

the investment of their contributions to the plan. 

That's in paragraph eight on page 2a.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But we don't know 

under what terms. I mean I've seen plans where you are 

entitled to direct, but that's subject to conditions and 

limitations.

 MR. ROBERTS: That's certainly true, Your 

Honor. But here, the court of appeals assumed that 

there was a fiduciary breach. That's on page 3a in the 

star footnote of the -- it's the appendix to the 

petition for certiorari. There is no reason for this 

Court to second-guess that, particularly since 

Respondent didn't argue in its motion to dismiss that 

there was no fiduciary breach here. So the case comes 

to the Court on the assumption that there is a fiduciary 

breach. And these are very important questions 

concerning whether assuming there is a fiduciary breach, 

a participant in a defined contribution plan can sue to 

recover for the plan the losses to the plan that are 

caused by that breach when the losses are attributable 

only to that individual's account.

clarify what the government's position is on this 

(a)(1)(B) argument? Are you saying it is available, but 

(a)(2) is available?

 MR. ROBERTS: We don't think that there is a 

claim at this point under (a)(1)(B), because the -- the 

money the Petitioner seeks -- what's happened here is he 

has alleged that there has been a fiduciary breach that 

caused a loss to the plan. The appropriate remedy for 

that is a recovery from the fiduciary in its personal 

capacity to put the money back in the plan. That's what 

section 502(a)(2) provides. Once the money is back in 

the plan and then it's allocated pursuant to the duty of 

prudence to the Petitioner's account, then if the plan 

didn't pay out the money to him when he was entitled to 

it, which he appears to be entitled to it now since he 

has withdrawn his account balance, he would have a 502 

(a)(2) claim -- a 502(a)(1)(B) claim, excuse me -- but 

he doesn't have a claim under that provision now. We --

at least we think it's very unlikely that he does, 

because generally plans provide that the benefits that 

are owed to people are the money that are in -- in the 

account.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, now we know what 

benefits would be due because he has withdrawn, but when 

he made this complaint and he hadn't been withdrawn, he

could have made an unwise investment the next time. And 

MR. ROBERTS: That's right, and then he 

would -- it would be even clearer, I think that he has 

no (a)(1)(B) claim, if he didn't have -- say he was 

still participating in the plan and he wasn't -- he 

hadn't withdrawn his account balance and didn't have a 

right to withdraw his account balance at that time, then 

he wouldn't have a right to any benefits from the plan.

 The crux of the matter here is that the plan 

has suffered a loss and that the appropriate remedy is 

against the fiduciary in his personal capacity; 

(a)(1)(B) doesn't provide for suits against the 

fiduciary in his personal capacity to recover money for 

the plan. It provides, again, suits against the plan to 

pay money out of the plan. This money isn't in the 

plan; it can't paid from the accounts of other 

participants because it would breach these duties under 

ERISA. The appropriate remedy is to get the money back 

in the plan.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree that if 

it is within (a)(1)(B) that it's therefore not within 

(a)(2)?

 MR. ROBERTS: No, because (a)(1)(B) provides 

an action for benefits from the plan and (a)(2) provides

an action against -- it's a different -- against a 

different defendant for a different kind of claim.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought your 

answer would be yes. In other words, if it's in (a)(1), 

it's not in (a)(2).

 MR. ROBERTS: If it's a claim for benefits 

under (a)(1) or to enforce the terms of the plan, such 

as if the fiduciary says, "I'm just not going to follow 

your instruction," and the participant wants a 

clarification of that and an order compelling the 

fiduciary in his official capacity to do that, yes, that 

would be a suit under (a)(1)(B) and there would be no 

suit under (a)(2).

 There's only a suit under (a)(2) if there 

are losses to the plan and if the remedy is to put the 

money back in the plan by getting it from the breaching 

fiduciary.

 If I could turn to (a)(3) just very briefly, 

Your Honor. We think that suits against fiduciaries to 

recover losses by fiduciary breaches are also authorized 

by section 502(a)(3), which provides for appropriate 

action, I believe.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that 1132 we are talking 

about?

reconcile with the structure of the civil enforcement 

provisions of Section %02, 1132 of the U.S. Code, 

starting of course with Section (a)(1)(B).

 To us this is the opposite end of the 

spectrum of the kind of case the Court was talking about 

in Russell and what Russell has been assumed to have 

been meant --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Russell was about a 

welfare plan, not a pension -- and as I recall, the 

plaintiff in Russell was seeking medical benefits that 

she didn't get and she wanted, not the benefits because 

she did get those, she wanted straight out damages, 

compensatory and punitive damages, for delay in the 

receipt of benefits. That's quite a different thing 

from saying I want the contributions made so that I will 

get the benefits to which I'm entitled.

 MR. GIES: You're right, Your Honor, that 

that is certainly distinguishable on the facts. We 

think the central teaching of Russell, though, applies 

with equal force to a defined contribution case like 

this, for several reasons.

 The first of which is that Russell has been 

assumed to reflect the dicing that we are talking about 

which provision in Section 502 is appropriate. 

Individual claims have traditionally been brought either

under (a)(1)(B) or under (a)(3). When a claim is being 

brought on behalf of the plan as a whole, Russell 

teaches and -- and helps define when those claims are 

available. It is an odd case here, where the plan is a 

defendant, to at the same time assert that this claim is 

being brought on behalf of the plan.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that is an oddity but 

what do you say to Mr. Roberts' argument that the only 

recovery under (a)(1)(B) is against the plan, and the 

plan doesn't have the money in the account so that if 

there is going to be any relief it's got to come from 

the fiduciary and that gets you into (2).

 MR. GIES: Well, because neither (a)(2) or 

(a)(1)(B) were invoked in the district court and the 

case comes up on a very spares record, it's hard to --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but we've got to 

assume at this point that we've -- we've got a -- a 

Section (2) claim before us and the argument simply is, 

is that in effect to be disallowed because it should 

have been an (a)(1)(B) claim? And the argument that the 

United States has made, the argument that the other side 

has made is, we cannot get to any money under (a)(1)(B). 

We've got to get that from the fiduciary and we can only 

do that under (2).

contribution plans and defined benefit plans in ERISA is 

an important consideration in answering that question. 

(a)(1)(B), the first clause, speaks of recovering 

benefits due to him. As you know from our briefs we 

argue this is a case for lost profits, not benefits, 

certainly not vested benefits in the way the Court used 

the term in Firestone.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So then you would agree 

that (a)(1)(B) is not available?

 MR. GIES: No, Your Honor. We believe that 

(a)(1)(B) definitely was available for the Petitioner 

here. What relief he might have recovered under 

(a)(1)(B) had he invoked that provision remains to --

would have remained to have been seen had it been 

invoked. There are three --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the argument of the 

United States is you can't rob Peter to pay Paul, so 

that if in fact his account didn't have the money, the 

plan didn't have any place to get the money, and the 

only way the money could be had would have been from a 

fiduciary, which again gets you to subsection (2).

 MR. GIES: It would only get you into 

subsection (2) if it could be argued that that claim was 

for the benefit of the plan as a whole, as this Court 

has taught in Russell; and it seems to me, Your Honor,

that one way to think about this in terms of which 

provision applies to which of these claims, is whether 

Congress really intended for these individual kinds of 

"he said; she said" claims to be brought. We think not.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But it seems to me 

you're answering a different question in that response. 

The argument here is basically an argument between the 

possibility -- an argument based on the claim that under 

(a)(1)(B) you can't go against the fiduciary. The only 

way you can get the money is from a fiduciary and 

therefore (a)(1)(B) would have been of no value to you. 

Do you -- do you take issue with that premise?

 MR. GIES: Well we think -- no. No, Your 

Honor. In general we do not take issue with that 

premise.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, then doesn't that 

leave you in the position of having to say that you've 

either got to bring the claim under (a)(1)(B), or you've 

got -- subsection (2) -- or you've got to bring it under 

subsection (3)?

 MR. GIES: We think not for this reason. 

The second clause of (a)(1)(B) permits a cause of action 

to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan. This 

is a case that if you give the Petitioner full benefit 

of the doubt probably could have been resolved with a

his rights under the terms of the plan.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And the answer, if the 

premise you have just agreed to is correct, will be, 

"you bet. He is entitled to have another $150,000 in 

his account for the benefit of future payments to him."

 MR. GIES: Well, we think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: "But we haven't got the 

money and we can't rob Peter to pay Paul and therefore 

we are very sorry, go away." That would necessarily be 

the answer.

 MR. GIES: Well, we think not with respect, 

Justice Souter, for this reason. Keep in mind the 

theory here is one for lost appreciation in the account. 

This plan does not have pooled assets.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that's going to the --

it seems to -- with respect, I think that's going to the 

merits. And the question is, if you can recover against 

anybody, the claim is, the argument is you're going to 

get nowhere under (a)(1)(B) because the plan can't help 

you by itself. The only way you can get any value from 

your lawsuit is by going against the fiduciary. Maybe 

you have good reasons to defend that, but if you're 

going to have a suit against anyone, it's got to be 

under subsection (2).

MR. GIES: I think the answer to that, 

Justice Souter, is that it reflects how careful and 

interrelated these provisions in 502 are.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And they're saying they are 

careful and interrelated provisions mean that you got to 

go under subsection (2).

 MR. GIES: To which we say --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And you're I think saying, 

we -- we agree with you that ultimately (1)(B) couldn't 

get you any relief because the fiduciary -- the plan 

doesn't have any money. And you're now arguing, well, 

if you go against the fiduciary, ultimately we have a 

good defense to that. But the fact is, the question 

before us is whom do you sue and under what -- under 

what section? And I think your own logic forces you to 

say that -- that has got to be subsection (2).

 MR. GIES: Well, one more answer to your 

question about (a)(1)(B), Justice Souter, is this: As 

you know, ERISA is a statute that provides for limited 

remedies, and the question of what remedies might be 

available under (a)(1) and whether or not this defendant 

would be solvent or somebody else would have to be 

impleaded in our view need not be decided in this case. 

We think it's sufficient to identify that --

reached yet, has it?

 MR. GIES: -- as another remedy that could 

have been pursued here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If there is a suit 

under (a)(1)(B) for a breach of the plan by a fiduciary, 

do you agree that the plan, if it's liable, could then 

sue the fiduciary? I realize I'm talking about a suit 

by one of your clients against the other, but would that 

be a feasible result under the statute?

 MR. GIES: Yes, it is, and it's also 

possible depending on the facts. And again, from this 

sparse record, it's hard to know that there could be an 

action filed against whoever it was who is alleged to 

have made the mistake. One of the issues, of course, in 

this case is it's not clear who made the mistake or 

whether or not the mistake was in fact a breach of 

fiduciary duty.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it entirely clear that 

the plan itself does not have any money to pay this off 

unless it takes the money from other individual 

accounts? I thought one of the briefs said that -- that 

some plans have independent funds. I forget what 

sources they came from, but some slush fund that they 

could use for this purpose.

think, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't called a slush 

fund. I know that.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. GIES: -- was a plan that provides for 

pool of assets. This plan does not. And so the answer 

to your question is no, there is no other place to get 

the money from, which we think is another reason why 

this is not on appropriate claim under (a)(2). It is 

not losses to the plan in the conventional way we 

understand those words. But the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what is the plan 

other than a collection of individual -- I mean the 

trustee is the trustee for the plan. All of the assets 

are there. The individuals do not have them in their 

pockets. So the trustee is managing this fund, which is 

then segmented into accounts for each individual. So I 

think your -- your suggestion is that these defined 

contribution plans, they come out entirely because --

because of the segmented accounts. So you could never 

bring a claim because it would always be an individual.

 MR. GIES: Well, we think that (a)(2), 

properly read, does not permit an individual claim. 

(a)(3) permits a claim for equitable relief, and 

(a)(1)(B) would permit a claim for benefits for the

other two.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why? Why? That's 

the question, it seems to me, in the case. Why? I mean 

-- imaginary example -- a plan, a thousand members. The 

trustee invests in a thousand diamonds. He puts it in a 

bank deposit vault. One day he takes all 500 diamonds 

and runs off to Martinique. We catch him enjoying the 

sun. We can sue him under (2), right? That's what (2) 

is there for, right? Right. Okay. Now, everything is 

the same except each of the thousand diamonds was put in 

individual safe deposit box with the participant's name 

on it. Everything else is the same. Why should it 

matter?

 MR. GIES: We think relief in that 

situation, including recovery of the diamonds and any 

profits associated with it, would be available under 

(a)(3).

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I'm sorry. I'm not 

interested in that question. I'm interested in my 

question. Why isn't it available under (a)(2)? In both 

cases, the trustee took 500 diamonds that belonged to 

the plan and went to Martinique. Now, if you can sue 

him when the plans are all put in one big safe deposit 

box with the diamonds, why can't you sue him when 

they're put in 500 small safe deposit boxes?

MR. GIES: I think the structure of defined 

contribution plans makes that a little inapt of an 

analogy, with respect, Justice Breyer. In this plan, as 

we know, the assets are not pooled. It is, of course, 

the sum and total of the individual plan accounts, but 

the question of legal ownership is different from the 

question of whether or not in this case it ought to be 

read as losses to the plan. Here it is by definition 

the most individual kind of claim that anybody could 

think about. It is a run of the mill, as alleged claim 

between an investor and a stockbroker essentially that 

the stockbroker did not execute the trade.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But do you dispute that 

there was not -- that there was a loss to the plan in 

the literal sense?

 MR. GIES: Yes, we do. For --

JUSTICE ALITO: If --

MR. GIES: For two reasons, first of all, 

there was no distribution until after he cashed out and, 

second, the nature of this claim, again, is for lost 

profits. It is not for benefits as in the sense of a 

defined benefit plan.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But if you accept the truth 

of his allegations, wouldn't the plan have greater 

assets than it had?

MR. GIES: No. Because there's no way to 

imagine that anybody made out on this. This is a case 

where the investment instruction was not followed. 

There's no way to imagine that my clients made any money 

on that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're arguing that 

ultimately he couldn't prove damages. We're talking 

about allegations at the pleading stage.

 Let me ask you a slightly different 

question. You said there's no -- there's no, as Justice 

Scalia put it, there's no slush fund; there's no pooled 

assets here. All the assets are assets which are 

accounted for, attributable to, individual accounts. 

Therefore there can be no -- there can be no loss to the 

plan which is not a loss to an individual account, can 

there be?

 MR. GIES: Yes, sir. That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then what is your theory on 

how we determine whether a loss to the plan from an 

individual account suffices as a loss to the plan for 

purposes of pleading? Has it got to be, you know, 500 

losses out of 1000? I don't see why that should make a 

difference. I'm going back to Justice Breyer's 

question.

 MR. GIES: Yes, I don't think the actual

number makes any difference, but I think the nature of 

the allegation, the type of fiduciary breach, does.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but why doesn't the --

MR. GIES: In the "stock drop" cases --

JUSTICE SOUTER: There's something I'm not 

understanding about your argument. When you say the 

nature of the fiduciary breach pleaded is what makes the 

difference, I am understanding you to be answering the 

question whether on the merits ultimately there will be 

a -- they will be able to make out a claim. And I am 

saying, as I said once before, that that seems to me a 

question that comes after you answer the question before 

us. And the question before us is not whether 

ultimately you've stated a winning claim, but whether 

ultimately -- whether right now you have stated a claim 

for a loss to the plan.

 Now, that is not your view. Why is it that 

I am taking your answer to be an answer on the merits to 

a different question and you're saying my answer, i.e., 

nature of duty breached or -- is one that goes to the 

question of pleading at this stage?

 MR. GIES: Because of the words "losses to 

the plan" in the text, the words on the page, in the 

context of the rest of 502. The words "losses to the 

plan" connotes something collective. The example --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you said -- you 

said it doesn't have to be every single member of the 

plan.

 MR. GIES: That is correct, Justice 

Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said it has to be 

more than one. How then do we read the statute to say, 

well, it doesn't have to be the plan as a whole because 

there may be some people that are not entitled to this? 

How do we get that number between more than one and less 

than everybody?

 MR. GIES: I would -- I don't think that 

that's a useful way to think about it either, Justice 

Ginsburg, which is why I think the right way to think 

about it in the context of this statute is to think 

about the nature of the allegation at the pleading 

stage. In the stock drop cases, the fiduciary breach 

alleged is an imprudent investment in holding company 

stock. I think the diamond analogy is closer to that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'm -- I'm asking you 

just -- in your -- you have said, you conceded, that to 

bring the suit against the trustee, it doesn't have to 

involve every member, every contributor to this defined 

contribution plan. But it has to involve --

MR. GIES: I think that's too harsh a rule.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- more than one. So 

that's the question I'd like to you address. You 

recognize that there can be a claim against the 

fiduciary for breach of trust on behalf of contributors 

to the plan? So in that lawsuit, how many people would 

there have to be to qualify? You say not everybody, but 

more than one.

 MR. GIES: Well, as we've argued we think it 

ought to be a substantial subset reflecting the nature 

of the breach alleged. That is, something systemic, 

something that affects the interests of the plan as a 

whole rather than just --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: For example.

 MR. GIES: -- one individual plan 

participant. For example, the choice of an imprudent 

investment, Your Honor, where -- and that's where most 

of these stock drop cases come -- they involve company 

stock held in 401(k) plans, and the allegation is that 

it is imprudent to continue to hold the shares of the 

stock.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If you do that in two 

accounts is that enough?

 MR. GIES: It -- it very well might be. Two

MR. GIES: Because --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If it -- if it is the --

and I still don't get this, but if it is the nature of 

the particular dereliction in duty that counts, why do 

we need more than one?

 MR. GIES: Because the nature of the 

dereliction of duty here is the most -- hard to conceive 

of a more individualistic kind of a breach. This is 

just one dispute, one he said/she said between a 

participant and the -- -

JUSTICE SOUTER: It's an individualistic 

kind of breach when it is viewed as -- as only one 

account, but it is a breach against the plan when it is 

understood that there is nothing to the plan except an 

aggregation of accounts. You can't have a breach 

against one without a breach against the plan.

 MR. GIES: To which we would say, Justice 

Souter, that it's qualitatively different to breach a 

duty as alleged here on an individual basis, on a 

one-transaction basis, in one account --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why, if that is your 

answer, why does it matter what the nature of the 

dereliction is? Because you're -- you're saying the --

the really important question is the nature of the 

dereliction. If it is, then I don't see why the

multiple of the number of accounts affected has anything 

to do with it.

 MR. GIES: Well, I suppose you could 

imagine, Justice Souter, a fact pattern where there was 

evidence -- not in this case, of course -- that there 

was a pattern, a systemic failure to handle properly 

investment requests made by --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And then you've got a lot 

of plaintiffs but what difference does it make?

 MR. GIES: Well we think that comes closer 

to what -- how we read Russell and how Russell has been 

understood.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That may be close to the 

way you read it, but why is your reading correct? Why 

should that make any difference?

 MR. GIES: Because in context with the rest 

of 502, 502(a)(2) has been understood, and we think for 

good reason, not to apply to an individual case. There 

are other remedies available, in (a)(1)(B) --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What? What other 

remedies?

 MR. GIES: In (a)(1)(B), and in (a)(3) for 

equitable relief.

for lost profits. You said that a few times. I thought 

(a)(1)(B) is a claim for benefits, current or future.

 MR. GIES: The third part of (a)(1)(B) 

permits a participant to sue to enforce his rights under 

the terms of the plan.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Which will -- which will 

get him nothing.

 MR. GIES: It might have got him the trade 

made, maybe a few days late.

my example. He only took one diamond. It was a big 

vault he took it from -- one diamond. You still have 

the claim, right?

 MR. GIES: And -- and is that a --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's a big vault. He took 

it from one big safe deposit box -- one diamond.

 MR. GIES: And -- and is it identified in 

one account?

the big vault.

 MR. GIES: Well, that's -- that's a 

fundamental difference.

no, no. I'm going to, of course, ask you, since you

loss was, well, it was just one diamond, out of 

thousand.

 Now obviously I'm going to ask you, because 

I haven't yet heard the answer -- at least I didn't seem 

to hear it -- what the difference is whether that one 

diamond came from a big vault or from one little safe 

deposit box with the participant's label on it.

 MR. GIES: It's still the same kind of loss, 

obviously. You're correct, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly, the same kind of 

loss. And what we have here is the footnote that was 

alleged in -- written in the opinion -- we assume the 

defendant's conduct amounted to a breach of fiduciary 

duties. So therefore all of the discussion you have, 

that maybe it didn't -- well, maybe you're right. But 

we better send it back so that they can decide that 

question. And I just don't see what the other 

difference is. It can't be a difference in the size of 

the diamond. And people are saying, well, why -- well, 

you see the question.

 MR. GIES: I do indeed, Justice Breyer. I 

think the structure of the plan bears something on the 

right answer because this plan does not have pooled 

assets accounts, there is no way that this alleged loss 

could have had any impact on any other plan participant,

nor could any recovery here benefit the plan as a whole.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask a question about 

your individual point? What if the individual's account 

was 60 percent of the assets of the total plan? Because 

different accounts are of different sizes. Would you 

give the same answer to that?

 MR. GIES: I'd give the same answer, Justice 

Stevens, in a situation like this with what I call the 

classic one-off, he said/she said request to make a 

brokerage trade.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if it was 90 percent, 

you'd give the same answer?

 MR. GIES: I could imagine a situation where 

the percentage gets so high that the assets might be 

held in such a way that they could be more easily seen 

to be a loss to the plan as a whole. For example, in 

some of these plans there's a --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So just one individual, as 

far as we know it's a very small percentage of the 

total. That's the whole case as I understand it.

 MR. GIES: That -- that's correct, Justice 

Stevens. I think it probably depends in your 

hypothetical on the nature of the asset. If it's mutual 

fund shares, as in this plan held by individuals, I 

don't think it would make any difference. Some plans

hold assets in common. This one does not.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You know I could understand 

your case if you said even if there were a hundred 

diamonds, each of them in an individual plan, there 

still is no loss to the plan until the plan itself has 

been held liable to make up for the loss. Up until that 

point, it's just a loss in each of the individual 

accounts.

 But you're not willing to say that. You say 

at some ineffable point it becomes a loss to the plan. 

I think there is a clear line between -- between saying 

there is no loss to the plan unless -- unless the plan 

is first adjudicated to be liable; then there is a loss 

to the plan.

 MR. GIES: Well, we certainly --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Prior to that it's just a 

loss to the individual account. That makes some sense. 

I mean, I can understand how that works. I can't 

understand how your system works. You're telling me it 

depends on how big the diamond is and -- and what kind 

of a breach it was. How can we write an opinion like 

that?

 (Laughter.)

my job, Justice Scalia.

(Laughter.)

 MR. GIES: But I think -- I think it's 

clearly right as this discussion indicates that the 

right place to begin here is with (a)(1)(B). If you 

have a claim like this, you look at the statute, it 

comes first. It has the benefit of being first on the 

page.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I know, because in making 

this, hitching your wagon to the (a)(1)(B) -- I thought 

you were arguing -- what did you say the remedy for this 

person would be? Assuming it's true that he put in his 

slip and he said invest in X set of mutual funds and the 

trustee missed it, lost it?

 MR. GIES: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is his remedy?

 MR. GIES: That's a very difficult question 

to answer because this is a defined contribution plan 

and not a defined benefit plan and this is a claim for 

lost profits. It's not an easy claim for lost benefits. 

Now that's why the second clause of (a)(1)(B), to 

enforce his rights under the plan, we think is the best 

part of (a)(1)(B) that this individual could pursue.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that what you argue in 

your brief?

 MR. GIES: What we argue in our brief and 

what we still say is that he could have pursued 

equitable relief under (a)(3).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would that be?

 MR. GIES: He could have picked up the 

telephone and called and said, like I think most of us 

would, say I asked you to sell my sells of stock and it 

hasn't happened yet. And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: He didn't know until he 

got the report.

 MR. GIES: Well, that's not so clear from 

the record, Justice Ginsburg, but in any case what 

equitable relief under (a)(3), just as (a)(1)(B) would 

permit him, is to get an injunction to force the trade 

to be executed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's much too late. 

It's over and done. It wasn't made.

 MR. GIES: It may or may not be much too 

late, Justice Ginsburg, which we think is another reason 

why as to (a)(2), we think it's unlikely that Congress 

intended every one of these he said/she said cases to 

give rise to a cause of action for damages. There would 

be no end to the kinds of claims that one could imagine.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's take, because this 

case was tossed out on the pleadings, the -- there are 

forms to fill out and says I want this set of 

investments as opposed to that set of investments. The 

contributor fills out that form, gives it to the 

fiduciary. A careless employee for the fiduciary loses 

it, and that's the story. So what's the remedy for the 

contributor who gave his instruction that weren't 

followed, not out of anything deliberate but just 

carelessness?

 MR. GIES: Well, certainly injunctive relief 

under (a)(3) would have been available.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Enjoining him to be 

careless?

 MR. GIES: Enjoining him to execute the 

trade was clearly a remedy available. And perhaps there 

would have been a remedy --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you say I want these 

funds invested in this particular set of shares for this 

period, for this six-month period, then two years later 

you can have that trade made? I don't understand it.

 MR. GIES: Well, we think the fact that it 

took him so long to sue is another reflection of the 

fact that this is a claim for damages. Had he really 

intended the trade to have been made, the normal thing

to have done would be to call up and say my trade wasn't 

made, please make it. And if that he didn't get an 

adequate response, you'd bring an action for an 

injunction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What's done meanwhile? He 

came in right at the bottom and a week later, it had 

gone up 30 points.

 MR. GIES: And we think the Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- no remedy?

 MR. GIES: We think that Congress did not 

want those kinds of claims to be brought under (a)(2) 

precisely for that kind of reason. There would be no 

end to the kind of arguments about damages. And those 

kind of cases impose costs that will ultimately be borne 

by the plans, which is inconsistent with the 

congressional purpose in ERISA to encourage plan 

formation.

 So this statute on this kind of a situation 

may provide him some remedies but maybe not a complete 

remedy for loss of all the profits that he claims he was 

denied.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You view it as a 

lost profits claim. Would your position be different if 

he directed a sale of the stock and then the stock went 

down 30 points instead of going up? That's not lost

profits. That's avoiding losses to the plan.

 MR. GIES: We think we have a different 

situation indeed if there actually had been a 

distribution here and the amount of the account had gone 

down between the alleged mistake and the distribution. 

There is clear as a claim for benefits under (a)(1)(B), 

and there I think quite easily the Court could say that 

in that situation the full value of the account at the 

time of the alleged mistake would be benefits under the 

terms of the plan. And we think that's a material 

distinction between this case and others, including the 

case called Glories v. Charles Schwabb that comes out of 

the Ninth Circuit.

 Now with respect to (a)(3), we think that 

the equitable relief is properly understood not to 

include compensatory damages and that this Court's 

decisions have been clear on that. As to surcharge, it 

would seem to me that the one -- the best that one could 

say is that it was the exception and not the rule and 

not typically available in the course of equity as this 

Court has understood --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And never available in a 

court of law.

 MR. GIES: And never available in a court of 

law. You're exactly right.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, then what is it? 

It's got to be something.

 MR. GIES: Well, I think what it was, as I 

understand the history of the equity jurisprudence, is 

that you could only sue the trustee in the equity 

courts. And so if you needed to get money and if it was 

a damages claim, that was the only place where you could 

bring the action.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This isn't like a 

cleanup.

 MR. GIES: It is not, Your Honor. As we 

understand the argument on surcharge, it is separate 

from clean up and we understand that and accept that. 

But it still sounds more like damages. It sounds 

something very different from what Congress, we think, 

meant when they wrote the language of 502.

 Unlike the Landrum Griffin Act, which 

permits actions for damages, ERISA does not, and Landrum 

Griffin was one of the statutes on which ERISA was 

based.

 It also has fiduciary duty obligations. It 

also has the interests of beneficiaries, members of 

labor unions at heart. And unlike this provision in 

ERISA, the Landrum Griffin act explicitly permits an 

action for damages. And we think that's further

evidence of the fact that appropriate equitable relief 

in a situation like this under (a)(3) does not include a 

claim like this for compensatory damages.

 If there are no further questions, thank you 

very much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Gies. 

The case is submitted.
