 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear 

argument first this morning in 05-11304, Smith versus 

Texas. 

Mr. Steiker.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JORDAN STEIKER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. STEIKER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 This case is here for the second time. In 

your summary of reversal, this Court held that 

Petitioner's mitigating evidence could not be given 

adequate consideration through the Texas special 

issues or the nullification instructions. On remand, 

the CCA found the error harmless by concluding the 

opposite, that Petitioner's jury could give 

sufficient consideration to his mitigating evidence, 

including specifically the evidence of his 78 IQ, 

learning disabilities and troubled background.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did they find it could or 

did they find that it did? I thought our holding was 

that given the instructions, the jury would not 

necessarily take into account those mitigating 

factors, and I thought that what the Texas court held

is, yes, that was a possibility, and we have to see 

whether that possibility came to pass, which is what 

harmless error analysis involves.

 MR. STEIKER: I think, Justice Scalia, 

what the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So they are not 

contradicting the fact that the jury wasn't required 

to take it into account, but they are saying 

nonetheless, in our view, the jury did take it into 

account, and therefore, the error was harmless. That 

doesn't contradict our opinion. I mean, you might 

want to argue against it on the merits, but I don't 

think that will contradict our opinion.

 MR. STEIKER: I think it does contradict 

your opinion, Justice Scalia. Your opinion said that 

Petitioner's mitigating evidence had little or 

nothing to do with the inquiries of the special 

issues, and your opinion also said that the 

nullification instruction, no matter how clearly 

conveyed or fully understood by the jury, would not 

solve that problem.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. And that 

means that the jury was not instructed to take it 

into account. And I think the Texas court is 

conceding that. But it's, it's saying, nonetheless,

we don't think that the error made any difference 

because, in our view, the jury did take it into 

account.

 MR. STEIKER: The matter in which the CCA 

posited that the jury could take it into account was 

the fact that on voir dire, the jurors said we can 

follow a nullification instruction and falsify our 

answers to the special issues in order to give effect 

to mitigating evidence. That was the exact same 

proposition that the CCA had issued in its first 

opinion that this Court summarily reversed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but it seems to me 

it's one thing to use it for the purpose of saying 

the instruction was okay. And it's something else to 

use it for the purpose of saying even though the 

instruction didn't require that, it was a fuzzy 

instruction and a juror could very reasonably have 

understood it not to allow nullification, 

nonetheless, we have satisfied ourselves that the 

jury indeed thought it had the nullification power. 

I don't see how it contradicts our opinion.

 MR. STEIKER: I think what's 

contradictory, Your Honor, is that the notion that 

the nullification instruction would be an adequate 

vehicle was what this Court specifically rejected.

JUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't say it was an 

adequate vehicle. I mean, they acknowledged that 

that instruction shouldn't be given again because it 

doesn't require the jury to do what, what you say the 

jury must do, and I think they accept that. They 

say, oh, no, I thought it was fuzzy, and didn't 

require -- we think the jury did indeed think it had 

the power to nullify.

 MR. STEIKER: And I would also add that 

when you actually look at the voir dire on which the 

CCA relied in which it said jurors express no 

discomfort, no hesitation about their willingness to 

falsify their answers to the special issues, the very 

first juror in this case, a lawyer, expressed exactly 

the kinds of discomfort that this Court feared and 

anticipated with the use of the nullification 

instruction.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Mr. Steiker, may I 

interrupt you or interrupt the course of your 

argument to get to a more preliminary point before 

you get down to details? Do you concede that 

harmless error analysis is ever appropriate, is ever 

open as an option following an, in effect, a finding 

of this kind of instructional error, Penry I 

instructional error? Do you concede that?

MR. STEIKER: Justice Souter, we do not 

concede that, but nor do we rely on that as a basis 

for relief in this case. We believe that the 

purported harmless error analysis that the CCA 

applied was so interwoven with a rejection of the 

Federal constitutional --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I quite agree. I 

understand that. Was the, was the issue of the 

availability of harmless error raised on your side of 

the case in the proceedings back in Texas?

 MR. STEIKER: Yes, it was. It was raised 

on remand from this Court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Also on the same 

preliminary line of inquiry, are we in as good a 

position as the State court to conduct harmless error 

analysis, or can we or must we defer to the State 

court's harmless error analysis?

 MR. STEIKER: I would say ordinarily this 

Court is not in as good a position as a State court 

to conduct harmless error analysis. Our belief here 

is that the, the basis for the State finding the 

error harmless was a very unusual rejection of the 

conclusion that this, these instructions would 

facilitate consideration of mitigating evidence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree that the

application of the harmless error analysis is a 

question of State law, though, correct?

 MR. STEIKER: I do not agree with that. I 

think that the application of harmless error 

analysis, when it's predicated on a misunderstanding 

of Federal constitutional law, is not an independent 

basis for decision. It's clearly wrapped up in the 

Federal claim, and I think this Court's cases have 

clearly so held.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So that if there is an 

instruction given to the jury and it violates the 

Constitution, then we, as a de novo matter, can 

determine the harmless error, harmless error inquiry?

 MR. STEIKER: It's, it's certainly 

possible. I don't think that that's a usual practice 

and I wouldn't advocate that here. And this is not a 

usual case in which the State has conducted an 

ordinary harmless error analysis. The State has 

actually in no way disparaged the power and extent of 

Petitioner's mitigating evidence.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is the level of 

harmless error determined as a matter of Federal or 

State law when there is a Federal law?

 MR. STEIKER: Generally speaking, it's a 

matter of State law with some limitations.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Really. You mean that 

they could have something that it has to be harmless 

beyond a reasonable doubt and we'd be bound by that?

 MR. STEIKER: Well, on direct review, 

Chapman clearly says it's a Federal question what the 

standard of review may be. And on direct review, 

it's undoubted that a harmless beyond a reasonable 

doubt standard is required by Chapman.

 This case doesn't present the issue on 

whether on State -- post-conviction, a State can have 

the latitude of requiring greater harm, because on 

the CCA's own analysis, the standard of harm that's 

applied on State habeas is identical to the standard 

of harm that's applied on direct review, the standard 

of Almanza, which posits Chapman error, harmless 

beyond a reasonable doubt for preserved error, and 

egregious harm for unpreserved error.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And, and this was 

unpreserved error. I mean, they are not saying this 

for everything. They are saying he did not object to 

the instructions at the time and therefore our 

harmless error standard is -- is more rigorous than 

it would otherwise be. What's unreasonable about 

that?

 MR. STEIKER: And we -- we argue that

there are three independent bases, Federal bases for 

finding that the application of egregious harm in 

this case to be violative of Federal rights. And I'd 

like to turn to the first of those arguments.

 Petitioner plainly objected that the 

special issues and verdict form did not allow for 

consideration of his mitigating evidence. That was 

and remains his core argument throughout this case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that's a very 

generalized argument, and what he won on was a very 

specific point that, that this instruction in effect 

required, if they were going to give mitigating 

effect, required a jury nullification. That's a very 

specific point.

 MR. STEIKER: On that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He did not object -- he 

did not object to that specific problem. Had he 

objected, the court would have said, you know, there 

is something to what you say, and I'll give a 

different instruction. But he didn't.

 MR. STEIKER: Everyone at trial understood 

that the special issues on the verdict form were 

unalterable, that Texas law required the legislature 

to specify what was on the special verdict form. 

What the trial court invited counsel to do was to

offer a different form of nullification in the 

supplemental instruction that would then interpret 

the special issues.

 This Court's opinion in its summary 

reversal made plain that the problem with 

nullification instructions is broad and intractable 

and applies to all nullification instructions.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What you're going to hear 

in a second, I'm sure, because I read it in the 

briefs, my understanding of the Texas point is 

slightly different. It is this. That under Texas 

law, when you file before the, before the trial, a 

general objection, unless you make the objection 

again when the specific, when a specific instruction 

is given, you've forfeited your rights to appeal. 

Under Texas law.

 And they say that's true of evidence and 

that's true here, too. And they say that's just 

Texas law, ordinary Texas law. Now --

MR. STEIKER: There's nothing --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's what you did, you 

didn't make the right objection. Now you come up 

here and well, you are out. You can't make any 

argument. But -- we are very generous, and we will 

let even people who make every wrong procedural thing

still have a shot, if what they have, if what they 

are pointing to absolutely egregious. But your isn't 

absolutely egregious so you're in the same boat as if 

you just didn't have any argument because you didn't 

follow the Texas law. Now, I take it, that's their 

point. What's your response?

 MR. STEIKER: I have special responses, 

Your Honor. The objection to the special verdict 

form and the special issues was made plain in 

pretrial motions and that objection was clearly 

recognized by the trial judge at trial and denied at 

trial when the instructions were being considered for 

the purposes of voir dire.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, you're there in a 

Texas court. We're not. We are following Texas law, 

they say, and you're wrong. Now, what are we 

supposed to do about that?

 MR. STEIKER: The court, the Court of 

Criminal Appeals did not invoke this basis for saying 

that his trial objection was inadequate. They didn't 

say that it was made at the wrong time, or in the 

wrong -- what they specifically said --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They applied, they 

applied a legal standard, the egregious harm 

standard, that depends on failure of an objection.

So I would have thought they, they certainly thought 

that there was an inadequate objection, or they 

wouldn't have applied that standard.

 MR. STEIKER: Yes, Your Honor. I -- I 

misspoke if I -- I conveyed the impression that they 

did not suggest that it was inadequate objection. I 

was merely suggesting that it wasn't inadequate in 

the sense that it was made at the wrong time, 

pretrial or at trial.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The judge, the judge, I 

thought, told the lawyers what the charge would be, 

and I think also said I can't give a separate charge 

on mitigation because that's a job that only the 

Texas legislature can do. I am bound by the statute 

to give these two things.

 I think the judge said that, so it was the 

understanding of everyone.

 MR. STEIKER: It was the understanding of 

everyone. It's reflected in the record in the first 

State habeas opinion that the Court of Criminal 

Appeals acknowledges that the verdict form was 

sacrosanct. That was not going to be altered, so the 

nature of the CCA's suggested failing of Petitioner 

was that he did not specifically object to the 

nullification instruction.

JUSTICE ALITO: It sounds like you're 

arguing that the Texas court misapplied Texas law, 

and you want us to reverse their application of their 

own law about what is an adequate objection.

 MR. STEIKER: No, Your Honor. I believe 

that the CCA misunderstood the Federal law of the 

relationship between Penry I and Penry II. The 

failing in this case was a verdict form that made no 

mention of mitigating evidence. The nullification 

instruction was the State's flawed defense to that 

failing.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes, but on the issue of 

whether there was an adequate -- I thought you were 

arguing that, in fact, there was an adequate 

objection. And if the, if the State court held 

against you on that point, that's an issue of Texas 

law, isn't it?

 MR. STEIKER: I don't think it is an issue 

of Texas law, Your Honor, because the basis for the 

finding that it was inadequate was that he had to 

separately object to the nullification instruction as 

opposed to what everyone agreed he object to, was the 

inadequacy of the verdict form. That was his Federal 

claim. And our view is that the misunderstanding of 

the nature of the Federal claim was what led the

Texas court to conclude that his objection was 

inadequate. I'd also like to --

JUSTICE SOUTER: May I, may I again 

interrupt you to just get the context of your 

argument? You said earlier that under Chapman, 

assuming there is a harmless error issue, that 

essentially is -- is necessarily a Federal issue. 

And therefore, I take it, the basis of your point 

here is, if that is a Federal issue, then the 

adequacy of actions of counsel to raise it is also a 

Federal issue. Is that correct?

 MR. STEIKER: That is correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is my understanding --

MR. STEIKER: That is correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Thank you.

 MR. STEIKER: I'd like to make it clear --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we make up our own 

procedural rules, too? I mean, why, why -- why is it 

just a Federal judgment as to whether it adequately 

complied with the Texas rule? Presumably we should 

make up our own rule.

 MR. STEIKER: I don't think you need to 

make up --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why not? You say it's a 

Federal question.

MR. STEIKER: It's a Federal question 

about what the nature of the claim is, and if the 

State's misunderstanding of the Federal claim was 

what was intertwined with its conclusion that it was 

an inadequate objection, that is a misunderstanding 

of Federal law. We also believe that the procedural, 

that the application --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's -- that's a little 

bit different from your, from your response to 

Justice Souter. You are making a much narrower 

argument. You, you don't --

MR. STEIKER: I believe our, I believe our 

right to be --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't assert that in 

every case when there is a procedural objection in a 

capital case or any case involving Federal law, 

Federal law will determine whether the procedural 

objection is adequate?

 MR. STEIKER: I agree with that fully, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you do, but you do 

take that position with respect to a harmless error?

 MR. STEIKER: I think that the question of 

whether an error can be deemed harmless is always a 

Federal question. Chapman says as much.

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. If we assume, 

for the sake of argument, that there is disagreement 

on that point, are there any cases of this Court on 

the matter of adequacy of State procedural bars that 

would support you, even on the assumption that it's a 

State, not a Federal issue?

 MR. STEIKER: Well, clearly Ake vs. 

Oklahoma holds that if the State invocation of the 

procedural rule is dependent on a judgment about 

Federal law, and that judgment is incorrect, it is 

not an independent basis for decision under the 

independent adequacy grounds.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What about the case, the 

name of which I cannot think of, to the effect that 

requiring procedural action by the defendant which 

would simply be a useless formality and so on?

 MR. STEIKER: That's Flowers.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It's Flowers. All right. 

Wouldn't, wouldn't that be authority that you would 

invoke, in the, in the sense, as I understood your 

earlier argument, that the, that the pretrial motion 

and the adjudication of that made it plain to 

everybody what the, what the issue was, and therefore 

requiring anything more would -- would in effect 

violate the Flowers rule?

MR. STEIKER: I agree with that, Justice 

Souter. I think that to apply the default in these 

circumstances where everyone was plainly aware of his 

concerns about the inadequacy of the verdict form in 

special -- and the special issues, would be imposing 

too high and too excessively burdensome a requirement 

for the preservation of the Federal right. I do also 

want to argue that there is a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that --

just, why is that too burdensome? What's so 

burdensome about saying I object to that instruction?

 MR. STEIKER: Well, he did --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're saying, 

there is a difference between saying it would have 

been futile and saying it's high and burdensome, and 

I'm just wondering what your specific point is.

 MR. STEIKER: My specific point is once he 

has made it plain -- and this is all that Texas law 

itself says is required -- once he has made it plain 

that he objects to a special verdict form which 

cannot allow for the consideration of mitigating 

evidence, and this Court's holding is that that is 

precisely the error in this case, that no 

supplemental nullification instruction could correct, 

he has plainly made clear what his objection was and

that they should not have applied any harmless error 

review, or that they applied the wrong standard? And 

if it's the latter, what was the standard they should 

have applied?

 MR. STEIKER: We believe it is the latter. 

That we are assuming that harmless error analysis 

could apply here without conceding that it's 

necessarily applied, but assuming for the purposes of 

this case that it does apply, it should have applied 

the Chapman standard, which is their standard for 

preserving --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It wouldn't be 

preserving the Chapman standard if it was Federal 

collateral review, would it?

 MR. STEIKER: No. It would be under 

Brett. It would be a different standard. But Texas 

law for jury instruction claims clearly states that 

for preserved error, the standard is Chapman.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It's preserved error on 

direct review, isn't it? On page 23 of their brief 

there's a footnote that, the red brief, that at least 

claims to describe the sort of the structure of Texas

law, and I thought under Texas law you got a Chapman 

analysis only if you were on direct review and had 

preserved error. Is that correct?

 MR. STEIKER: I think that the CCA's 

position and Respondent's position is that Almanza 

applies dually on direct review and post conviction, 

and that that's that's their explanation for why the 

State court didn't impose a procedural default on 

State habeas. And one of our views is even if you 

don't agree that under Federal law this objection was 

inadequate, we believe that the State could not in 

effect change its mind about the adequacy of his 

trial objection only after this Court summarily 

reversed its rule on the merits. And we think there 

are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it 

didn't have to reach the harmless error question 

after it made an erroneous determination that there 

was no error at all. When the case came up here and 

the Court determined there was error, then it was 

necessary to reach it. I don't see that it's 

changing its position at all.

 MR. STEIKER: I think it is changing its 

position. When four judges signal that this may be a 

procedural impediment in the case and the court

declines to embrace it, I think that is a signal to 

this Court that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Wouldn't it be 

normal exercise of judicial restraint to say, we 

don't have to reach out and decide whether this error 

was harmless if we've already decided there's no 

error at all?

 MR. STEIKER: I think it would not be in 

the case of State habeas, for this reason. The vast 

overwhelming number of cases that proceed into State 

habeas are on their way when they're final into 

Federal habeas, and the State court was abandoning 

this argument for Federal habeas. That is, it was 

removing any procedural impediment to a merits 

review.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I just don't -- you 

say whenever, whenever a court decides the case on 

the merits instead of using an intervening procedural 

objection, the procedural objection is waived.

 MR. STEIKER: No, I do not make that, I do 

not make that broad argument, Your Honor. I think in 

the special circumstances of State habeas, where, as 

this Court knows, 99 percent of cases are on their 

way to Federal habeas, and the State does not adopt 

this procedural impediment which would from a

judicial --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Especially in capital 

cases, courts don't like to say, oh, you know, yes, 

you may be innocent but there's this procedural 

objection. I think most courts --

MR. STEIKER: I'm afraid that's not my 

experience with the court of criminal appeals.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's my experience 

with a lot of courts.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it's a very 

bad -- I think in the long term in the broad category 

of cases, it would be a very bad solution for 

defendants, because what's going to happen, once a 

court's determined there's no error at all, it's much 

easier for them to say, oh and by the way if there 

was it's harmless. And if they did that and then it 

turns out there was an error, you're going to be back 

here saying, well, don't be bound by their harmless 

error decision because they thought there was no 

error at all, so they didn't focus on it carefully.

 I would say the way they approached it in 

this case is the more desirable way. If you don't 

think there's an error don't go on and decide whether 

it's harmless or not in the abstract.

cases, Chief Justice Roberts, the courts in Texas 

take that approach, which is if there is a procedural 

impediment to the case they flag that procedural 

impediment, rule on alternative grounds, and I think 

that is good evidence that in this case when four 

justices urged a procedural element --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why, why, why do you say 

there are a lot of cases where it doesn't matter? I 

would have thought every case it mattered. Look, 

isn't it an absolute rule that there's a Federal 

issue in a case and there's a State ground, the State 

ground typically is a failure to raise an objection, 

and a State court says the Federal ground is what 

we're talking about. They say nothing about the 

State ground and they decide the Federal ground. The 

defendant goes to a Federal court and he says, I'm 

entitled to be released because they got the Federal 

ground wrong. I thought it's a hundred percent the 

case, and this is where you'll correct me, that it's 

now too late for the State to raise the State ground 

but the State's waived their adequate and independent 

State ground and that if they try to raise it again 

the answer is always, not some of the time: I'm very 

sorry, State; you're out of luck; you should have 

decided it on the State ground and not reached the

right, sir.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why wouldn't that be the 

case? Suppose the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose the State --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't there a difference 

between waiving it as a procedural bar and waiving it 

as an objection to the proper standard of review?

 MR. STEIKER: We don't think it's a 

difference, Your Honor, because we think the 

underlying fact, the adequacy of the trial objection, 

was what obtained. And I'd like to point out --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Who gives the State court 

the power to, as you say, waive that objection? I 

can understand when you say the prosecutor didn't 

object. It's the prosecutor that has the power to 

forfeit certain arguments on behalf of the people 

which he chooses not to raise.

 MR. STEIKER: I think "waiver" might not 

be the right word.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --

MR. STEIKER: But it's clear that if the 

State court does not rely on a procedural impediment

when the case goes into Federal habeas that 

impediment cannot be reintroduced in the case as a 

separate ground of decision.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But even if it is, 

logically anterior to consideration of that 

procedural impediment is a particular ruling on the 

merits and the State court didn't make that merits. 

They thought there was no error. It is logically not 

necessary for them to decide whether an error is 

harmless if they don't think there's an error, and to 

say that they waive that, that later ground I would 

have thought would be very surprising. Why do we 

remand these cases for further proceedings not 

inconsistent with our opinion if there's nothing 

further to be considered?

 MR. STEIKER: I think that the concerns 

for judicial economy in this case would have dictated 

that if the State court believed that the trial 

objection was inadequate, it would have rested its 

decision on that ground to essentially preclude 

merits review of that Federal constitutional issue.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Otherwise you have a 

Supreme Court decision that the State court can say, 

thanks, thanks, that's very interesting advice, but 

we -- there was a procedural default here. Although

we bypassed it the first time, we're not going to 

bypass it after the Supreme Court has told us what 

the Federal law is.

 MR. STEIKER: I think it's a special risk 

in State habeas when the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it would be a 

special risk if you, if you, if you allowed them to 

raise the bar, allowed a State to raise a bar to 

consideration of the issue.

 But I want to go back to your answer to 

Justice Stevens' question. You, you say you draw no 

distinction between the, the procedural failing as a 

bar to raising the issue and as a basis for 

determining a standard of harmless error review 

later. I don't understand why you, you can maintain 

there is no distinction because if they may not 

consider it as the basis for their, their standard of 

harmless error review, assuming we have such a thing, 

then what are they supposed to use as their standard? 

Your answer I take it is Chapman, but Chapman as I 

understand the statement of Federal law would not 

apply -- State law -- Chapman would not apply in 

these circumstances. And if you were in a Federal 

court and this were a Federal conviction Chapman 

wouldn't apply on collateral review.

So it seems to me that you've either got 

to accept the distinction between procedural error as 

bar to issue, procedural error as basis for standard 

of review, or you have no way to figure out what the, 

what the standard of review should be.

 MR. STEIKER: Well, we would take the CCA 

at its word that the Almanza standard's appropriate. 

But if the underlying fact of the adequacy of the 

trial objection has basically been accepted by the 

State court, we don't believe that on State habeas it 

could reintroduce the inadequacy of that.

 I'd like to reserve if I may the remainder 

of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. CRUZ: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 Two postulates govern this case. First, 

reconciling Jurek and Johnson and Graham on the one 

hand and Penry II and Tennard and Smith II on the 

other hand is not an easy task and State and Federal 

courts have struggled for two decades to draw the

appropriate lines and to faithfully apply this 

court's Penry jurisprudence. Second, the usual 

default rule in both State and Federal court is that 

most constitutional errors are subject to harmless 

error review.

 Petitioner suggests that the State habeas 

JUSTICE SOUTER: I take it that is not an 

issue before us?

 MR. CRUZ: It is an issue that on the 

reply brief Petitioner has essentially conceded. In 

footnote 5 Petitioner states that he is not seeking 

reversal on the basis that Penry error is structural 

error. But that is the issue of what the Court of 

Criminal Appeals did to us.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the Penry error, even 

if not structural, is not subject to harmless error 

review and you could say that that distinction is 

possible because Penry has a built-in harmless error 

or a harmful error component. But as I understand it 

that's not -- that issue is not in this case.

 MR. CRUZ: It is not in this case because 

of Petitioner's concession, but Petitioner's 

concession has serious consequences because the only 

ground upon which Petitioner can prevail in this

Court is that the State court's application of 

harmless error violated the United States 

Constitution and by giving up his structural error 

argument he gives up virtually any basis to lay out 

why that would violate the U.S. Constitution, not 

simply why it was incorrect but why it is 

unconstitutional for the State court to apply that 

doctrine.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It's a question of 

waiver, part of it. I mean, that's -- it's well 

established that, I guess, I mean, if a State waives 

an adequate State ground by considering the Federal 

issue, the Federal courts will go into the Federal 

ground and they can't later, can they -- is there any 

case you found anywhere -- I haven't found one --

where say any Federal court considered a State case 

where the State went into the Federal issue, the 

State had said nothing about a State ground, and then 

after the Federal court's decided it somehow the 

State got a hold of it again and they this time said, 

oh dear, we forgot, we forgot; in fact, there is the 

State ground here. And is there any case that you 

found like that which says that was permissible?

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, I do not 

disagree with you.

 MR. CRUZ: But that's not what happened 

here.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Right.

 MR. CRUZ: I do not disagree with you that 

if the State court had concluded for Petitioner on a 

State ground TO begin with and after being reversed 

revisited that conclusion --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. I'm saying 

the State typically decides against the defendant. 

They decide against the defendant on a Federal issue. 

There's a perfectly adequate State issue. It's 

called failure to object, and they don't mention it. 

I'd be repeating myself. Are you following what my, 

my -- and I'm saying is there any case you found 

anywhere which says after that occurred that the 

State when it gets a hold of the case again can say, 

oh dear, we forgot, there's also this adequate State 

ground, bad luck? I've never seen such a thing. I 

doubt that you have.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Breyer, there is no 

suggestion --

JUSTICE BREYER: And I say this would be 

the first.

MR. CRUZ: That's not what happened here 

and so we are not urging that ground to support what 

the Court of Criminal Appeals did. But as the Chief 

Justice suggested, the Almanza standard, the State 

harmless error standard, is a two-step inquiry. 

Inquiry number one, is there error; and under State 

law if you conclude no the analysis ends. So the 

first time the State court considered this it 

concluded there is no constitutional error and so it 

never addressed harmless error.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm making a mistake 

here. I thought that the reason they bring in the 

Almanza standard is, as I put it before, a kind of 

act of charity. That is, since there was no 

contemporaneous objection or proper one, you don't 

get any appeal normally. But we'll let you do it if 

you can show egregious harm. I'm wrong about that?

 MR. CRUZ: That is not exactly how the 

State court and State law does it. What the State 

law does and our position in this case is that 

Petitioner failed to preserve his objection because 

he did not object specifically on the grounds --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but Mr. Cruz, is it 

not true that if he did fail to preserve the 

objection then there should have been a procedural

bar to the case going forward?

 MR. CRUZ: There is not a procedural bar 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Why is that?

 MR. CRUZ: -- because the State Court of 

Criminal Appeals has chosen to forgive failure to 

preserve for purposes of procedural default and 

subsequent habeas rights.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, they are 

saying that the failure to object does not 

constitute -- would constitute a procedural bar if we 

elected to treat it that way, but we've decided not 

to, but we're nevertheless going to rely on the 

failure to object to justify a higher standard of 

review on harmless error?

 MR. CRUZ: That's exactly correct, Justice 

Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is there any precedent 

for that ambivalent use of a potential procedural 

bar?

 MR. CRUZ: Let me suggest it's not an 

ambivalent use, but rather what the Court of Criminal 

Appeals has held, in the Black case it held that 

Penry I was so novel that the State courts would 

excuse a failure to preserve for purposes of

procedural bar. So in this regard the State court is 

more forgiving to defendant than the Federal courts 

are.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Cruz, none of 

this went on in the opinion and there were four 

judges of that court who said there's a procedural 

bar here, end of case. The majority never explained 

why they weren't going along with that. I didn't see 

anything in the majority opinion that said, well, 

never mind that there's a procedural bar here, we're 

going to deal with the Federal question.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, you're right 

that in Smith I, the Court of Criminal Appeals, the 

majority did not explain why there wasn't a 

procedural bar. But there had been a long line of 

cases where the CCA had decided Penry errors were not 

going to bar access to the courthouse, and just last 

week in another decision that was decided after 

briefing in the case, in the In Re Hood case, the 

Court of Criminal Appeals made clear that in its 

judgment Penry II was also so novel that for purposes 

of successive risk it would excuse a failure to 

preserve.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The simple 

question is the procedural objection, as the four

judges suggested, could have precluded consideration 

of the Federal claim at all.

 MR. CRUZ: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the court said 

we're going to go ahead and consider it, and then 

when it turns out that they got it wrong and there 

was error they had to apply harmless error review. 

In Texas law, harmless error review turns on the 

standard whether there was an objection or not, and 

they went back and said there was no objection. The 

contrary assertions assumes that when they let the 

claim go forward, that they were waiving any reliance 

on objection for any purposes, not consideration on 

the merits, but also for any eventual later 

consideration on harmless error pursuant to the 

established State standard.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Cruz, would you 

clarify one thing for me? Did the Texas Court of 

Appeals say in effect, there is a procedural bar but 

we're going to waive it, or did they just not address 

the issue?

 MR. CRUZ: In Black they said exactly what 

you say.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: How about in this case?

they didn't say because longstanding CCA 

precedent made clear that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you're assuming 

there's longstanding precedents. It is also at least 

conceivable that at the time they thought the 

objection was properly preserved.

 MR. CRUZ: It is conceivable, but I would 

suggest the more reasonable inference is they 

followed their long line of precedents that said 

we're not going to interpose, as the Chief Justice 

suggests, a total bar to raising these claims. So 

for procedural default and for successive writs, 

we're not going to penalize Petitioners for failing 

to make objections. Just because the State court 

decides to be more lenient than the Federal courts in 

that respect does not mean that they also need to 

apply the lesser standard of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you're assuming that 

they decided to be more lenient rather than assuming 

that they may have actually decided and rejected the 

procedural bar.

 MR. CRUZ: Well --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's at least possible 

on this record, is it not?

 MR. CRUZ: They did not say one way or the

other the first time.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No. But isn't the 

implausibility of the argument that you are making 

something like this: You say the Texas rule is not 

that failure to object is a procedural bar but that 

failure to object determines the standard of harmless 

error review if in fact there is a later appeal. The 

implausibility, though, I guess of the position is 

that as I understand it, four members of the Texas 

Criminal Court of Appeals did not understand that to 

be the case at all. Four of them said it is a 

procedural bar. The four did not understand that 

there was this rule that you invoke, and when the 

four said there is a procedural bar, the majority of 

the court never came out and said no, there isn't.

 MR. CRUZ: The most reasonable explanation 

for that, Justice Souter, I would suggest is at the 

time of Smith III the Court had not decided Hood, 

which means it had not concluded that Penry II was 

also so novel that it would forgive failure to raise 

it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't the consequence of 

that, though, that for purposes of this case there 

was no clear State bar at the time in question and 

therefore, they cannot apply it now? Maybe they can

apply it in cases down the road. I'll assume for the 

sake of argument that they can. But not in your 

case, because the bar was not established at the 

relevant time in your case.

 MR. CRUZ: That would arguably be the case 

if on remand the Court of Criminal Appeals had 

applied procedural default and refused to consider 

the case -- the claim, but not what it did.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But what it is 

doing is in effect saying there was a kind of default 

which is subsumed in what the four dissenting 

justices said the first time around. And so we're 

going to, we're going to sort of call it a half-loaf 

procedural default, but we never said so the first 

time around.

 MR. CRUZ: Respectfully, they are 

altogether separate concepts that procedural default 

is a total bar to the courthouse.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I can understand that 

they would be separate concepts if there were a rule 

or if there had been a rule in place at the time he 

was going through his State habeas that so said. But 

we don't seem to have such a rule because as you 

said, there was disagreement within the court, and 

Hood had not been decided, and therefore --

MR. CRUZ: But Black had.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Pardon me?

 MR. CRUZ: Black had and Almanza had.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Black being -- help me 

out, Black?

 MR. CRUZ: Black is what excused the 

failure to raise Penry I for novelty. And so it was 

clearly established State law at the time of this 

trial --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that goes to Penry I, 

and this is then an objection both to Penry I and 

based on Penry II.

 MR. CRUZ: But the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So it's --

MR. CRUZ: But the Hood -- the Hood 

decision with respect to Penry II is being forgiving 

to criminal defendant. It's not a bar. It's 

forgiving a bar. That does not mean that the Almanza 

standard which had been present for -- has been 

present in State law for over 20 years is suddenly 

inadequate.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You're right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But did they cite that 

case in this case, in this opinion in this case?

 MR. CRUZ: They absolutely cited Almanza.

JUSTICE BREYER: Speaking of that case, 

can you give me any citation? And just give me a 

citation, and here there may not be one, but you give 

me a citation where Texas previously said that a 

defendant who raised an objection before trial to the 

application of the statute to his client, he said 

it's unconstitutional as applied to my client, give 

me one example in Texas law where that was raised and 

the State appeals court of any -- at any level said, 

I'm very sorry, you can't really appeal that because 

you should have said it again during the trial.

 MR. CRUZ: Respectfully, Justice Breyer, 

that is not what we are urging, and I'm very glad you 

asked that question because I'd like to clarify what 

we are urging in our brief. That is not why we think 

Smith is not defaulted.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, there's 

no case, there's no case in Texas law which says what 

I just said?

 MR. CRUZ: I don't know if there is or not 

but our --

JUSTICE BREYER: You can't say.

 MR. CRUZ: Our argument is not based on 

the timing of the objection, so it has nothing to do 

with when he did or didn't raise his objection. And

so --

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought it was because 

he didn't raise it again in the trial.

 MR. CRUZ: That is not --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is the argument?

 MR. CRUZ: The argument is that he made a 

different objection, a substantively different 

objection, because what he filed was an argument that 

the Texas death penalty was unconstitutional on its 

face across the board and as applied to him, and he 

made a conscious strategic choice which is, when the 

judge presented a charge to the counsel and said do 

you have any objections, do you have any suggestions, 

is there any way I can change it, he could have done 

what Penry's counsel did. Penry's counsel twice 

asked the judge, please instruct the jury on 

deliberateness so they can consider my mitigating 

evidence for deliberateness. Penry I said that would 

solve the Penry problem.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. But in this case 

the counsel for the defendant did one other thing, 

and it said to the judge, you don't have authority 

under State law to add to these supplemental 

instructions. And I was going to ask you, he was 

right about that, wasn't he?

MR. CRUZ: Justice Kennedy, he was 

categorically wrong about that, and that 

fundamentally --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Really?

 MR. CRUZ: Yes. For two reasons. Number 

one, because Penry I, which has already been decided, 

this Court has said the way to correct a Penry error 

is to give an instruction. And the Court of Criminal 

Appeals following Penry had already squarely held the 

way to correct a Penry error is to give an 

instruction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What instruction? I 

haven't seen one. I haven't seen --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was it the nullification 

instruction?

 MR. CRUZ: That's what the Court of 

Criminal Appeals has said Penry I said, a 

deliberateness instruction or a catch-all 

instruction. So -- but in both cases, both this 

Court and the State court have said judges can give 

an instruction. And Penry I's counsel made --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is your instruction --

I think this is of some importance. My understanding 

in this case is that the judge as well as counsel 

thought that the judge couldn't say in essence what

became the Texas law because the legislature put it 

in, which is: Jury, is it two special issues, but 

you can consider all the mitigating evidence and it's 

up to you if you think that mitigating evidence is 

enough to have a life rather than a death sentence. 

That I thought the judge couldn't do. I have not 

seen a prelegislative change, charge in Texas that 

says what the legislature provided.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, that is in 

fact what the judge did here. What the judge could 

do clearly under Texas law is give any reasonable 

instruction to cure the error. What the judge 

couldn't do is submit a third special issue. It 

couldn't ask the jury, check, is there enough 

mitigating evidence to sentence to death. So it 

couldn't change the output from the jury. It 

couldn't add a new special issue but it could give 

any instruction possible to correct the error. That 

was Texas law, that you could give instructions, but 

the special issues are set by statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so the jury, what 

they take into the jury room is something that says 

these are the two questions that you must answer.

 MR. CRUZ: But they also have a written 

charge, so they get a written charge with the

instruction.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which tells them that 

the only way that they can give effect to mitigating 

evidence is if they answer one of those questions 

falsely.

 MR. CRUZ: But this Court said in both 

Penry I and Penry II that if the trial judge defined 

deliberateness appropriately, even under the old 

special issues, that it could solve the problem.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in this case the 

judge said I'm going to give the nullification 

instruction, and the attorney said, and I think quite 

properly, he said that won't work.

 MR. CRUZ: But what the attorney -- the 

attorney didn't say that won't work because it puts 

jurors in an ethical quandary, it causes them to 

violate the oath. What the attorney said is, you can 

give no instructions. And the reason for that 

strategic choice is that Smith's counsel made the 

judgment, I want it to be impossible for my client to 

be subject to the death penalty.

 Had Smith's counsel made the same 

objection that Penry made, had he read Penry right in 

front of him and asked, give me a deliberateness 

instruction, it would have cured the error. But the

reason I would suggest that Smith's counsel didn't is 

that the quantum of mitigating evidence in this case 

was so slight compared to the pervious cases that he 

made a very conscious strategic choice, I'd rather go 

all or nothing. I would rather make an argument that 

there is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Cruz, how can 

you make that assumption when the kind of mitigating 

evidence that has been considered possible within 

these special questions, the -- the -- in the Graham 

case where the reputation of this young man, he was 

sweet, gentle, kind, God fearing, and so the murder 

that he committed was an aberration. And youth. 

Those are the two things that I know that we have 

recognized fall within that. The evidence in this 

case is surely not that we are dealing with a sweet 

and kind person. We are dealing with somebody who 

has been abused as a child and who has a mental 

disorder.

 MR. CRUZ: Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg, 

the evidence was precisely that he had been sweet and 

kind. Over 90 percent of the evidence that defense 

counsel relied on in closing was the 15 character 

witnesses to show that he was a big lovable Teddy 

bear and went to church, and was sweet and kind, and

he had overcome these obstacles, and this was a 

momentary aberration. That was the central theme of 

defense's arguments. And in fact when the court --

JUSTICE SOUTER: When you say 90 percent, 

you're talking about argument time, aren't you?

 MR. CRUZ: I'm talking --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Your answer to that is, 

there were several hundred pages of records from 

school and the testing that went on in school that 

indicated there was something seriously wrong with 

this guy.

 MR. CRUZ: Well -- and it's interesting. 

The several hundred pages they talk about, there are 

three IQ tests that he had gotten. When he was 7 

years old he tested at 87; when he was 10 years old 

he tested at 87; when he was 13 he tested at 78. 

They -- and they introduced all three. These were 

the school records. There weren't competing experts. 

It's interesting in closing arguments --

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Maybe -- but 

the fact is that we're talking right now about sort 

of quantum of evidence. Was there something serious 

there for the jury to consider which in effect is the 

basis for all of this argument? And it seems to me 

it's not fairly characterized by saying, well, 90

percent of the mitigation case was that he was sweet 

and loving there. Whether you find it -- whether you 

find it persuasive or not, there was a substantial 

amount of evidence of -- going to his mental capacity 

and to his abuse.

 MR. CRUZ: Justice Souter, not only was it 

a very small part of the presentation, but in closing 

argument defense counsel explicitly pointed out to 

the jury that -- and let me read from defense 

counsel's closing: "I think it speaks well for both 

sides, the State and the defense to be quite honest, 

that we didn't bring you some hired gun, some 

psychiatrist that gets paid to get up here and say oh 

well, these are all family problems." And that is at 

33, volume 33 of the record, page 59.

 He affirmatively -- in Penry the whole 

argument was there's IQ problems, there's serious 

abuse. There's no abuse in this case, Justice 

Ginsburg, no allegation of abuse whatsoever. And he 

affirmatively said to the jury, look, we're not 

relying on some psychiatrist saying there are all 

these family problems. Our story is that this is a 

good person who led a good life and this is an 

aberration.

Mr. Cruz. Mr. Schaerr.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENE C. SCHAERR

 ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA, ET AL.,

 AS AMICI CURIAE SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

 MR. SCHAERR: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 I represent California and 20 other states 

who are concerned about the implications of 

Petitioner's arguments for their ability to apply 

their own varied harmless error standards in their 

own State habeas proceedings, and thereby to strike 

what they believe to be the right balance between the 

two competing concerns that this Court identified in 

Calderon. One being the significant social costs of 

retrial or resentencing, and the other the desire to 

ensure that the extraordinary remedy of habeas corpus 

is available to those whom society has grievously 

wronged.

 And with those concerns in mind, I'd like 

to address three specific points. The first is the 

whole question of whether States have the ability 

under our Federal Constitution to choose their own 

harmless error standards even when they are 

addressing Federal error. Petitioner appears to 

concede as a general matter that States do have that

authority, but let me just briefly indicate why that 

concession is well founded.

 First of all, as this Court has held in 

Pennsylvania versus Finley --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Are you talking about 

both collateral review and direct review, or just 

collateral review?

 MR. SCHAERR: I'm just talking about 

collateral review right now.

 As this Court has held in Pennsylvania 

versus Finley, the States are under no obligation to 

provide collateral review at all, and so it would be 

extraordinary if they take the step of deciding that 

they will provide such review, for this Court to say, 

well, if you're going to do that you have to apply a 

Federal standard on State habeas review rather than 

the standard that you choose.

 Secondly, to the extent the States decide 

to provide habeas review or any other kind of 

post-conviction review, the authority by which they 

do that derives from State law, not from the Federal 

Constitution or any other Federal law, and this Court 

obviously does not have general supervisory authority 

over, over State courts as it does Federal courts.

 And third, unlike the situation with

direct review, this Court could not as a practical 

matter impose a Federal standard on State habeas 

proceedings without being highly intrusive. I mean 

JUSTICE BREYER: In, in this case suppose 

the following circumstance. Suppose a Federal court 

has decided in the case of this defendant --

MR. SCHAERR: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- there was an error of 

Federal constitutional law, search and seizure or 

confessions or something, and now we send it back. 

And let's suppose further the State has no 

independent State ground, they are not trying to make 

the argument, whether or not they're trying to make 

it here. There's no independent State ground, no 

objection to problem, nothing. Now, I read that one 

standard that could be applied is the structural 

error standard. A second is a harmless error 

standard. But I've never seen a case, but that's 

perhaps my ignorance -- -that's whey want you to show 

me -- where it's definitively established by a 

Federal court anyway that there was a serious Federal 

error, I've never seen a case where this Court said, 

or I can't recall one, that the State applied yet 

some third kind of standard, such as, well, I know

there was a very important error, I know it was 

Federal and constitutional, but nonetheless we're not 

going to give them any remedy unless it's absolutely 

egregious harm. I've never seen that in the law.

 Now, can you point to me in the law where, 

which will correct my lacuna?

 MR. SCHAERR: I'm not aware that the Court 

has expressly addressed that precise question, which 

I think is --

JUSTICE BREYER: Have you ever seen it in 

a State? Have you ever seen a State which gets a 

case back from --

MR. SCHAERR: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Where? Where should I 

look on that?

 MR. SCHAERR: Well, our amicus brief, Your 

Honor, cites, cites dozens of cases in which, in 

which States have addressed Federal --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I'm not talking 

about that because obviously they can do what they 

want, I think, in the State courts, but they might 

violate Federal law if they do it. And now so what's 

happened is somebody has gone into Federal court or 

this Court and Federal court or this Court has said: 

Here's a Federal error, of course you're free to

apply harmless error or whatever, you don't have to 

let the person have a new trial or let him out.

 But I've never seen an instance I can 

think of where, that having happened, the State then 

applied yet some third standard like absolutely 

egregious horrible harm or not totally wonderful harm 

or something like that. I've never seen. That's 

what I'm looking for. Is there such an instance?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or plain error, as 

applied in the Federal cases under Alano.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, that's possible.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there some reason, 

Mr. Schaerr, why that would be more egregious when 

the Federal constitutional question has been answered 

by a Federal district court than it is when the 

Federal constitutional question has been answered by 

the State supreme court? Wouldn't it be just as bad 

when the State supreme court has said the Federal 

Constitution has been violated and then the case goes 

back to the lower State court and the lower State 

court applies some standard for plain error which is, 

which is simply different from what is, what is being 

urged here today. I'm sure that happens all the 

time.

 MR. SCHAERR: I'm sure it does.

JUSTICE SCALIA: And I don't know why it's 

any worse, any worse when you do it to a Federal 

district court's determination of what the Federal 

Constitution says than when you do it to the State 

supreme court's determination of what the Federal 

Constitution says.

 MR. SCHAERR: That's right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I guess the reason would 

be that there is a problem with enforcing Federal 

constitutional standards. I have not heard of a 

State that says, suppose the jury was chosen in a 

racially discriminatory way, suppose there are all 

kinds of things, the State says, well, we admit, we 

admit that there is this violation, but we're just 

not going to apply a harmless error standard. We're 

going to apply a tough one. I guess that would be 

the reason. That's why I don't think I've ever seen 

it.

 MR. SCHAERR: Right, and the question is 

whether the State is free in that circumstance to 

apply a State harmless error standard or if it has to 

be required to apply a Federal harmless error 

standard. And our -- and the fact is that on the 

ground the States are routinely applying State 

harmless error standards in those situations. And so

it would be a sea change if this Court were to now 

hold that, no, when a State court is reviewing the 

effect of a Federal error that the State court has to 

apply a Federal standard rather than the State.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is there any special 

Federal harmless error standard that applies to 

unpreserved error?

 MR. SCHAERR: I think it's the Alano 

standard, at least in the Federal --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's for Federal, 

that's in the Federal courts. But there isn't one 

that's applicable able to the State courts, is there?

 MR. SCHAERR: No, no. There isn't.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we haven't had the 

issue before us, have we? That's why you're here.

 MR. SCHAERR: That's why I'm here, that's 

right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: This question is a 

little different. If you had two harmless errors in 

a given State, do they have to apply them 

consistently?

 MR. SCHAERR: Well, then the question 

would be is there some Federal law reason why they 

have to. I mean, they may under State law have to 

apply them --

JUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, if for 

example the higher standard only applies to 

unpreserved error and the record clearly establishes 

and the several State judges confirm there was no 

unpreserved error, then would there not be a duty to 

apply the lower standard?

 MR. SCHAERR: There may be under State 

law, it's not clear why that would raise a Federal 

issue.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And if the State follows 

the rule in just one exceptional case before the 

Federal court, can the court said, hey, you're not 

following your regular rule?

 MR. SCHAERR: Well, there may be a due 

process objection to that, but here the only 

objection --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there no Federal 

interest in ensuring that there is a full and fair 

implementation of a Federal right? And if the State 

higher standard is erroneously applied, doesn't that 

prejudice the Federal right?

 MR. SCHAERR: Well, that may be one reason 

why we have Federal habeas proceedings.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that reason would 

apply equally, however, to determinations of Federal

rights by State courts.

 MR. SCHAERR: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I think everybody 

understands that State courts do this all the time, 

and indeed a good way to do an end run around what, 

what, what the other side in this case seems to want 

is simply for the State supreme court to find a 

violation of Federal law so that it doesn't get to a 

Federal court and then have the State lower court 

apply whatever harmless error standard it wishes, 

which would be a crazy system.

 MR. SCHAERR: That's right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So if you're going to 

adopt this rule, this rule would have to be adopted 

not only for references back to the State court from 

a Federal decision, but you would surely have to 

apply it to all State determinations of Federal law, 

and I don't really know what authority we would have 

to require lower State courts to do that.

 MR. SCHAERR: Well, that's, that's exactly 

right and especially in the habeas context it would 

be, it would be extremely intrusive and invasive for 

this Court to attempt to do that. It's one thing on 

direct review of a State criminal conviction to say 

as a matter of Federal constitutional law we think

there was an error here and we're going to nullify 

the conviction, which is what the Constitution gives 

this Court the power to do. But it's quite another, 

after the conviction is final and the defendant is 

already incarcerated, then on a State habeas 

proceeding for the issue to come, to come back to 

this Court, it would be extraordinary for this Court 

to say, well, you have to apply Federal standards or 

Federally dictated procedures in that circumstance.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

counsel.

 Mr. Steiker, you have 4 minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JORDAN STEIKER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. STEIKER: I'd like to return to the 

record in this case because I think once it's 

clarified what the nature of the evidence was in this 

case it's clear that this Court could find that the 

error was harmful under any standard, including the 

egregious harm standard. We have in this case over 

200 pages of exhibits documenting a lifelong 

disability. This evidence was first introduced in 

the guilt-innocence phase of the trial. It was 

argued at the guilt-innocence closing argument, in

which trial counsel said, this is a 19-year-old ninth 

grader who has been charged with this crime, and 

argued that that was the basis for considering him 

less culpable than his college-educated co-defendant.

 During the punishment phase, it's clear 

that the single most important witness, the one whose 

testimony was the most central, the most 

time-consuming, was Alberta Pingle, who brought in 

all of the school records showing from at the time 

the Petitioner was in school he had been diagnosed as 

a learning disabled, possibly organic in nature, 78 

IQ. And his counsel emphasized this as the central 

basis for withholding a death sentence. He said, 

this man has a 78 IQ, 8 points from being mentally 

retarded, lifelong learning disabilities, possibly 

organic in nature.

 And the argument that there was no 

evidence of abuse in this case is belied by the fact 

that the evidence showed that Petitioner's father 

chased him with a butcher knife in order to steel the 

family's car in order to support his crack habit. If 

that's not evidence of abuse and evidence that could 

show reduced culpability for this defendant, coupled 

especially with his impairment which made him less 

capable of responding to that role model and avoiding

dangerous behavior --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about 

General, Mr. Cruz's comments that this was a minor 

point in counsel's summation before the jury?

 MR. STEIKER: It is true that this 

evidence was presented as only one page of his 

closing argument, but that was because of the problem 

in this case. As this Court noted in its summary 

reversal, the prosecutor got up right before defense 

counsel and said: You promised us on voir dire you 

would answer the special issues honestly and that if 

the evidence supported a yes answer to deliberateness 

and dangerousness you would give us yes answers. 

Basically, right before he spoke the prosecutor gave 

an anti-nullification instruction which said this 

evidence isn't relevant to the special issues of 

deliberateness and dangerousness.

 In that posture, he was left to argue that 

the evidence showed he wasn't dangerous, that the 

evidence showed he didn't act deliberately, and just 

hope that the jury would be willing to lie on the 

special verdict form.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this argument

its determination of this question of Texas State

law?

 MR. STEIKER: His argument --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, your argument 

right now.

 MR. STEIKER: I'm sorry. I don't 

understand.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is your argument 

an argument that the Texas State court was wrong on 

its ruling under Texas State law harmless error.

 MR. STEIKER: No. Our argument is that 

when you take out the clearly impermissible Federal 

conclusion that the jury could give effect to this 

evidence, which was exactly what this Court said to 

the contrary in its summary reversal -- this Court 

said this evidence couldn't be considered. The State 

court said he has extensive evidence, he has powerful 

evidence, powerfully presented, dramatically 

presented, but we think, unlike the Supreme Court, 

that a carefully crafted nullification instruction 

will facilitate the jurors' consideration of it.

 So if you take away the impermissible 

Federal conclusion, this Court could clearly 

conceive, conclude, on the basis of the State court's 

own characterization of this evidence, which departs 

tremendously from the Respondent's view, that this

was powerful mitigating evidence. The Court of 

Criminal Appeals' error was to conclude that this 

could be taken into account after this Court said 

exactly the opposite.

 Thank you, Your Honor.

counsel. The case is submitted.
