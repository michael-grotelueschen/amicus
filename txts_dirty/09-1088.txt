3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next in Case 09-1088, Cullen v. Pinholster.

 Mr. Bilderback. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. BILDERBACK, II, 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. BILDERBACK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

9 it please the Court:

 There are three main points I wish to 

11 emphasize to the Court this morning: First, because the 

12 California Supreme Court rejected Mr. Pinholster's claim 

13 of ineffective assistance of counsel on its merits, 

14 Federal habeas corpus relief is unavailable under 28 

U.S.C. section 2254(d)(1) unless Mr. Pinholster first 

16 met his burden of demonstrating that the State court 

17 rejection of his claim was unreasonable. He did not do 

18 that in this case, and thus the lower courts erred in 

19 granting him habeas corpus relief.

 Second, because Mr. Pinholster never even 

21 alleged, let alone proved, that he could not have 

22 presented the factual basis upon which the Ninth Circuit 

23 predicated its decision to grant relief when he was in 

24 the State court, 2254(e)(2) should have been a barrier 

to the State court Federal evidentiary hearing.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could we just clarify 

2 what you mean by "factual basis"? To be precise, he 

3 didn't -- because he didn't present the expert opinion 

4 with the diagnosis, or because the diagnosis was based 

on a series of facts that, to me, appear to have been 

6 presented fully to the State court; is that correct? 

7  MR. BILDERBACK: Yes. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: With the exception of 

9 the fact that the defense attorneys only worked 6 hours, 

the billing records. That -- I think that's the only 

11 underlying facts to the opinion that appear new; am I 

12 correct? 

13  MR. BILDERBACK: No, Your Honor. The 

14 diagnosis itself is a fact. The -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So we are 

16 only talking about the expert opinion facts being new? 

17  MR. BILDERBACK: We -- there are a number of 

18 facts that were new in the Federal -­

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What -- besides the 

opinion, what were they? 

21  MR. BILDERBACK: Well, as the Court 

22 adverted, there was also the notion that there was 

23 somehow a limited amount of time, specifically -­

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, he did allege that 

in his petition before the State court?

1  MR. BILDERBACK: He did not allege 6 and a 

2 half hours, Your Honor. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Not specifically, but he 

4 said that his counsel didn't prepare.

 MR. BILDERBACK: That's precisely correct, 

6 Your Honor, but the court -­

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And he pointed to the 

8 fact that counsel basically said at the trial, I didn't 

9 think we were going to have a mitigation hearing, as 

proof of that, correct? 

11  MR. BILDERBACK: He did point to that, Your 

12 Honor, but we would note that the 6-and-a-half-hour 

13 conclusion drawn by the Ninth Circuit and drawn by the 

14 district court is not fairly supported by the record.

 But, putting that aside, the principal fact 

16 that we are focusing on that we think is a new and 

17 significant change in the factual posture of the case 

18 from the time he was in State court to the time that he 

19 was in Federal court is the diagnosis of organic brain 

damage by the expert, which is not simply the opinion of 

21 the expert, but a question of material fact that was 

22 relied upon by the Ninth Circuit in its decision to 

23 grant relief.

Supreme Court that petitioner has organic brain damage

1 and the centrality of that factual determination on the 

2 Ninth Circuit's decision making is -- was a substantial 

3 difference between the facts upon which the State -­

4 with which the State court was presented and the facts 

that the Ninth Circuit granted -- rested its decision to 

6 grant relief. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Bilderback, I know that 

8 that's the principal fact that you rely upon, that 

9 there's a difference, but could you give us a full 

catalogue of the facts that are different in the Federal 

11 court record from the facts that are different in the 

12 State court record? Was there anything other than the 

13 medical testimony and the billing sheets, or is that the 

14 extent of it?

 MR. BILDERBACK: Those are -- those are the 

16 significant facts that we think are -- are relevant to 

17 -- to the discussion of whether or not the State court 

18 determination should be or could properly be found to 

19 have been unreasonable, was -- was the difference in the 

specificity of the -- of the nature of the claim of 

21 deficient performance in terms of the time sheets and -­

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about 

23 Dr. Stalberg's new deposition? Doesn't that count as a 

24 new fact? I'm looking at your brief on page 11. At a 

deposition just before the evidentiary hearing,

1 Dr. Stalberg revealed that nothing in the new material 

2 called into question his original diagnosis. 

3  MR. BILDERBACK: Oh, certainly, Your Honor. 

4 I -- I understood the questions from the Court to be 

asking which new facts were relied upon in the decision 

6 to grant relief. Certainly, there were new facts 

7 adduced during the Federal proceedings that we think 

8 inveighed against a grant of relief, and I think that 

9 the fact that Your Honor points to is precisely one of 

those. 

11  But, in terms of the new facts -- and let's 

12 be clear that 2254(d)(1) is a rule that says that relief 

13 cannot be granted if the State court determination was 

14 unreasonable. To the extent that relief is denied, the 

inclusion of new facts in the analysis may not run afoul 

16 of (d)(1) at all. So here, because the Ninth Circuit 

17 relied so heavily upon the organic brain damage 

18 diagnosis and because that diagnosis -­

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could we just be clear?

 MR. BILDERBACK: Yes. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought that 

22 Dr. Stalberg's affidavit in the State court said that he 

23 had brain damage of some sort.

Honor.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What he did say -- I 

6 think there's a difference between -- because he pointed 

7 to epilepsy. He pointed to a series of things that 

8 showed some brain damage. I just want to clarify. 

9  MR. BILDERBACK: Certainly.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's not organic damage; 

11 the issue is whether the organic damage created a 

12 dysfunctionality that contributed to the events. That's 

13 what he didn't know, and he said: It's not -- I would 

14 have needed more information to figure that out.

 MR. BILDERBACK: Well, he -- he never said 

16 that if he had had the additional information, that he 

17 would have diagnosed Mr. Pinholster as suffering from 

18 organic brain damage. He -­

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. Organic 

brain damage dysfunctionality. There's a difference 

21 between the two diagnoses. 

22  MR. BILDERBACK: Absolutely, Your Honor, but 

23 I want to be clear that Dr. Stalberg never diagnosed 

24 Mr. Pinholster with organic brain damage, even at the 

conclusion of the Federal evidentiary hearing, following

1 which he had access to all of the facts that habeas 

2 counsel was -- managed to unearth during the course of 

3 the Federal proceedings. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your adversary points to 

the difference in language between (d)(1) and (d)(2). 

6  MR. BILDERBACK: Yes. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: (D)(2) refers to 

8 unreasonable in light of the facts, unreasonable 

9 determination of facts in light of the record before the 

court, and subdivision (1) doesn't. It speaks only an 

11 unreasonable decision. 

12  Could you address the difference in the 

13 language and why that difference doesn't suggest that 

14 the question of an unreasonable legal determination 

should be based on the record before the Federal court, 

16 which in most instances, the vast majority of instances, 

17 is just a State court record? 

18  MR. BILDERBACK: That's correct, Your Honor. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there are exceptions 

in (e)(2) for hearings. 

21  MR. BILDERBACK: Yes. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why shouldn't the 

23 first subdivision be read to mean unreasonable legal 

24 determination in light of the record before the court?

 MR. BILDERBACK: Because subdivisions (d)(1)

1 and (d)(2) serve very different purposes. Subdivision 

2 (d)(2) is concerned with determinations of fact, and the 

3 additional language that the Court points to was an 

4 attempt to limit the bases upon which a Federal court 

could overturn a State court factual determination. 

6  Prior to the passage of AEDPA, a Federal 

7 court could overturn a State court determination of fact 

8 not simply because the evidence was lacking, which is 

9 the current state of the law, but also because it found 

some sort of procedural defect or a number of other 

11 bases that had grown up in the common law. With the 

12 passage of AEDPA, Congress limited the bases upon which 

13 a State court factual determination could be rejected to 

14 only one.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you suggesting that 

16 if a State court gets a proffer of evidence from a State 

17 petitioner who says, I have a billing record that shows 

18 that my attorney worked only 6 hours; and the State 

19 says, we're not admitting that billing record because it 

hasn't been authenticated, so we're not looking at that 

21 fact; and the Federal habeas looks at what was proffered 

22 and says, this is authentication under any rule, State 

23 or Federal -- it was improperly admitted, so their legal 

24 determination was wrong? Not unreasonable legal 

determination as to the IAC, because in fact -- I used

1 the example of 6 hours. The billing record could show 5 

2 minutes, so that there's no dispute that the person 

3 spent essentially no time on mitigation, didn't present 

4 anything. The clearest case you want. You're 

suggesting that a habeas corpus court is no longer 

6 permitted to look at that new evidence? 

7  MR. BILDERBACK: Well, what I'm suggesting 

8 is that the language of (d)(2) was designed to limit the 

9 bases upon which a Federal court could overturn a State 

court factual finding. Of course, our case doesn't 

11 really involve (d)(2). 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, but I'm going back 

13 to (d)(1). 

14  MR. BILDERBACK: Yes, and the -- the 

symmetrical language in (d)(1) is the language -­

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's not symmetrical, 

17 though. 

18  MR. BILDERBACK: I would -- I would 

19 disagree, because I believe the symmetrical language in 

(d)(1) is the limitation on the Federal court's reliance 

21 on lower Federal court authority to overturn State court 

22 factual determinations. 

23  Prior to the passage of AEDPA, lower Federal 

24 courts were free to look to their own prior precedent, 

the prior precedent of the circuit courts, to say that 

11

25

Official 

1 the State court determination of a question of law was 

2 unreasonable. In both statutes -- statute -­

3 subdivision (d)(1), which has to do with questions of 

4 law and mixed questions, the additional language 

narrowed the focus to a new and more limited basis for 

6 Federal review or to find the State court determination 

7 unreasonable. 

8  In (d)(2), there is this symmetrical 

9 limiting language which overturned what had historically 

been several bases for rejecting a State court factual 

11 determination. 

12  But, in both sections, the law is clear that 

13 the - the examination is of the application that was 

14 conducted by the State court. The section itself speaks 

in the past tense, and the very concept of 

16 reasonableness compels the conclusion that the State 

17 court determination can only fairly be read in light of 

18 -- in light of the facts that were squarely presented to 

19 the State court. Otherwise we could be in a situation 

where all of the facts before the State court are 

21 entirely removed, an entirely new set of facts are 

22 proven up in the Federal court, and we're going to say 

23 that, notwithstanding that wholesale change in the 

24 factual basis of the claim, that the State court 

determination was not merely wrong, but unreasonable.

1  And it is this notion of unreasonableness, 

2 and it is the primacy of the State court determination 

3 of the claim that is the central feature of the AEDPA 

4 reforms to Federal habeas corpus. The point was to make 

State court determinations the primary forum for 

6 adjudicating Federal constitutional claims, and Federal 

7 courts were only supposed to interfere in those 

8 determinations reluctantly. And if you examine the 

9 language of AEDPA, you'll see that, in -- in many 

respects, it mirrors the language of 2244, the "second 

11 or successive" language in Federal court. 

12  The purpose of AEDPA was to enforce upon 

13 Federal courts the same respect for State court 

14 determinations of claims that Federal courts showed to 

their own prior State court determinations of claims. 

16 State court determinations of Federal constitutional 

17 claims are not lesser creatures deserving of less 

18 respect than Federal court determinations of claims. 

19 And here they put very specific language in the statute 

that was designed to ensure that when a Federal court is 

21 examining a State court determination of a claim, it 

22 limits itself to only those facts that were before the 

23 State court. And, indeed, this Court has specifically 

24 said so in Holland v. Jackson, that the (d)(1) 

determination is done in light of the record before the 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 State court. Similarly, in Michael -­

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, there's a 

3 paragraph right after what you cite that basically says 

4 unless there's a hearing. So Holland works -- doesn't 

stop at the point that you're quoting. It goes on in 

6 the very next sentence to say "unless a hearing has been 

7 held." 

8  MR. BILDERBACK: And if a hearing is 

9 appropriately held, that's a very different question. 

But as this Court stated in Michael Williams, if the 

11 2254(d)(1) question is dispositive, no Federal 

12 evidentiary hearing is required. And that would be our 

13 position in this case. Because this claim survived 

14 2254(d)(1) scrutiny, the Federal evidentiary hearing 

should not have been held, just as, in the Michael 

16 Williams case, this Court ratified the decision of the 

17 district court not to hold an evidentiary hearing 

18 because the claim failed under (d)(1). 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why don't we start 

the way that you are proposing, which is to start with 

21 (e)(2): Was the hearing appropriately held, first? And 

22 if it was, why are we excluding the evidence that was 

23 developed at that hearing? What you're proposing is the 

24 reverse, to say we start at (d)(1) -­

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and only if the 

2 petitioner wins under (d)(1), on proving that the 

3 decision on the facts before that -- the State court 

4 were reasonable, that you ever get to (e)(2).

 MR. BILDERBACK: And that's why -­

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Why is that logical? 

7 Why isn't it logical to start with (e)(2), which is -­

8 it says in (e)(2) these are the prerequisites to having 

9 a hearing, you prove you're entitled to it. Why are we 

excluding those facts from the decision makers' 

11 consideration? 

12  MR. BILDERBACK: Well, setting aside for the 

13 moment a point I hope to get to, which is I believe that 

14 they did fail under (e)(2); but assuming the premise of 

the question, which is that (e)(2) has been satisfied 

16 and that the Federal evidentiary hearing might be 

17 appropriate, it makes no more sense to conduct a Federal 

18 evidentiary hearing before you conduct a (d)(1) analysis 

19 than it would to conduct a Federal evidentiary hearing 

before you do the 2254(a) analysis of whether there's a 

21 Federal question, the 2254(b) and (c) analysis of 

22 whether the claim is properly exhausted, or the 2254(d) 

23 analysis of whether the State court resolution of the 

24 claim was reasonable.

 The statute is laid out in a methodical,

1 calculated, and logical manner. And if the court just 

2 adheres to the calculated, methodical, and logical 

3 manner of the statute -­

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I can tell you 

the one thing you've said that makes no sense: There's 

6 nothing logical about this statute, or clear about this 

7 statute, as the legion of cases that the lower courts 

8 have addressed in trying to interpret it and as the 

9 legion of Supreme Court cases that have dealt with this 

statute -­

11  MR. BILDERBACK: Well, I would submit that 

12 we could bring some much-needed clarity to some of the 

13 confusion on these issues if the -- I think the plain 

14 language of 2254(d)(1), which is retrospective and 

contextual, is -- was -- is given its full force and 

16 effect. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does that 

18 work -­

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: Have you thought about -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How does that work, 

21 counsel, if you have new evidence? My claim was 

22 decided, it was reasonable under (d)(1) based on what 

23 they knew, but I've come up with new evidence that I 

24 think could not have been reasonably discovered before 

the (d)(1) hearing? What happens to that? It seems to

1 me you determine whether that evidence can come in under 

2 (e)(2). 

3  MR. BILDERBACK: Well, the -- the question 

4 -- and I think the question the Court's asked seems to 

implicate the ACLU's hypothetical in their amicus brief. 

6 But the problem with doing the (e)(2) analysis before we 

7 examine the reasonableness of the State court 

8 determination is those new facts that were never 

9 presented to the State court are going to, as it did in 

this case, confound the court's analysis of whether the 

11 State court determination was reasonable. 

12  If new facts arise which call into question 

13 some factual determination by the State court, or let's 

14 say new evidence arises which calls into question a 

State court factual determination, of course that 

16 implicates subdivision (d)(2) and that -- that 

17 implicates subdivision (e)(1), neither of which are in 

18 play in our case. But, under those circumstances, we 

19 might find ourselves asking the question, depending upon 

the nature of the new evidence, whether or not that 

21 evidence is of such a caliber that it's going to 

22 transform the claim. And if it so transforms the claim 

23 that we're no longer going to consider it the same claim 

24 that was adjudicated by the State court -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so you

1 think -- and I have trouble understanding the parties' 

2 position on this. When you talk about claims, you don't 

3 mean totally different legal bases; you mean different 

4 evidentiary support. The claim that it's ineffective 

assistance of counsel based on organic -- the failure to 

6 discover the organic brain damage you say might or might 

7 not be considered a new claim, and, therefore, (d)(1) 

8 would not be a bar to that. 

9  MR. BILDERBACK: Oh, it's our position that 

the introduction of the organic brain damage evidence 

11 fundamentally changes the nature of this claim. So that 

12 this -- the claim upon which the Ninth Circuit granted 

13 relief is a claim that was never presented to the State 

14 court. It is not simply a matter of -- of additional 

evidence that tends to support. And the best 

16 evidence -­

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So then -- and the 

18 reason that doesn't undermine your position is because 

19 you think it's evidence that could have been discovered 

and presented earlier? 

21  MR. BILDERBACK: Well, indeed, the very 

22 nature of their claim compels the conclusion that it 

23 could have been presented. 

24  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I understand that. 

But if it were evidence that could not have been 

18

1 discovered previously, then (d)(1) does not bar looking 

2 at (e)(2)? 

3  MR. BILDERBACK: Depending upon the nature 

4 of the new evidence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's really a new 

6 claim? 

7  MR. BILDERBACK: And, again, I think we have 

8 a pretty well-settled body of jurisprudence that's 

9 instructive on that, and that is the 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii) 

analyses of when a claim that was previously adjudicated 

11 on the merits by a Federal court can be revisited in a 

12 subsequent petition that is filed in the Federal court. 

13 If the nature of the claim is so fundamentally changed 

14 that we're going to consider it a new claim, then it is 

not the same claim that was presented to the State 

16 court. 

17  However, because it wasn't presented to the 

18 State court, depending upon the availability of a State 

19 remedy or any State procedural bars, those sort of 

traditional habeas corpus limitations -­

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose -- I 

22 suppose the Federal court can send it back to the State 

23 court for exhaustion. 

24  MR. BILDERBACK: If -- if that's -- if 

that's an appropriate remedy. But the -- the problem

1 with the procedure that was used in this case, and -­

2 and some of this I acknowledge is idiosyncratic to this

 But the problem with following a procedure

of the claim was wholly reasonable, the claim has

18 have been discovered through the exercise of due 

19 diligence. You're -- and you're out of the

4 presented to the State court, and those facts 

fundamentally transformed the claim such that the claim 

6 upon which the Ninth Circuit granted relief was never 

7 presented to California. 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay. So then this is an 

9 (e)(2) case.

 MR. BILDERBACK: No, Your Honor, because you 

11 only can leap to (e)(2) if the State court never had the 

12 opportunity to examine the facts of the claim and if the 

13 petitioner can show that he could not have previously 

14 presented the claim to the State court.

21  MR. BILDERBACK: Well, depending on how the

23 State court erects a procedural bar then, yes, this 

24 Court's well-settled jurisprudence on the question of 

procedural bars is going to control whether or not we

presented precludes the conclusion that they could not 

6 have presented this evidence to the State court in the 

7 exercise of reasonable diligence. They have asserted 

8 that any reasonable attorney in 1984 at the time of the 

9 trial had to discover the organic brain damage diagnosis 

that Dr. Vinogradov offered in Federal court, but the -­

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Bilderback, going 

12 back to your question of what's a claim. So the claim 

13 here could be ineffective assistance at the penalty 

14 stage. Or you could be saying, no, the claim is 

ineffective -- ineffective assistance for failing to 

16 present evidence of organic brain damage. That would be 

17 a narrower understanding of the claim. Or still 

18 narrower, it might be ineffective assistance for failing 

19 to present evidence of a particular kind of brain 

damage, frontal lobe brain damage, which is what the new 

21 doctor said, as opposed to what the old doctor said, 

22 which was bipolar disorder. 

23  So how do we choose the level of generality, 

24 if you will, when we try to figure out what the claim 

is?

1  MR. BILDERBACK: Well, of course, a claim is 

2 made up of two components, and one of them is -- is the 

3 legal theory of the claim, and the other is the factual 

4 landscape that we're asking that legal theory to be 

applied to. So, for example, if someone were to present 

6 to a State court or, frankly, to a Federal court, a 

7 claim as general as the first statement that you made, 

8 Justice Kagan, that my trial attorney gave me 

9 ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase, 

that's a claim that's void for vagueness. 

11  Rule 2 requires that you specifically 

12 identify the factual bases of your claim to the Federal 

13 court in your Federal petition. And California has a 

14 similar rule that requires you to communicate the 

factual bases of the claim. If we utterly change the 

16 factual basis of the claim, then it is in essence a new 

17 claim. 

18  I see that I'm almost out of time. I'd like 

19 to reserve the balance for rebuttal.

Official 

1 Justice, and may it please the Court: 

2  There has been a lot of discussion about 

3 changes from State to Federal court, but if we limit 

4 ourselves, even to the evidence that was only presented 

in State court, the mitigation evidence demonstrates an 

6 objectively unreasonable application of Strickland, and 

7 the judgment of the Ninth Circuit should be affirmed on 

8 that basis alone. 

9  We presented a substantial amount of legal 

specificity and factual specificity in support of our 

11 claim. We alleged in State court that his mom had run 

12 over his head, that -- at age 2 and a half, and a year 

13 later his head had propelled through the windshield in a 

14 car accident, and that it caused mental and organic 

impairments that affect intent and culpability. 

16  And Justice Kagan asked, what is the rule 

17 for the generality of the claim? I believe it is that 

18 which focuses on what is legally relevant in the habeas 

19 hearing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but, look, you say 

21 that, even on the basis of the facts before the 

22 California court, your client deserved relief. That may 

23 well be, but that's not what the -- what the Ninth 

24 Circuit said. The Ninth Circuit said that your client 

deserved relief in light of the facts before the

1 California court plus other facts. 

2  Now, I'm not going to go back and answer a 

3 hypothetical question of whether, if the Ninth Circuit 

4 said on the basis of those facts alone that were before 

the California court, if -- if the Ninth Circuit had 

6 said that, would that opinion be affirmed? That's not 

7 the opinion they came up with. They added facts. So it 

8 seems to me that you have to live with what they wrote. 

9 And the basis of their decision included additional 

facts. 

11  MR. KENNEDY: We do have to live with the 

12 basis that the Ninth Circuit wrote, and the Ninth 

13 Circuit majority en banc said that there were alternate 

14 bases for granting relief. It felt that the (e)(2) 

Federal hearing was compelling, but it specifically 

16 stated that if you set aside the new mental health 

17 theories that were introduced in Federal court and 

18 focused only on the historical upbringing and childhood, 

19 and the mental health facts alleged in State court, that 

basis and that basis alone would support a finding. And 

21 the dissent mentions this as well. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A finding under -­

23 under the standards that we've applied under AEDPA?

unreasonable application of Strickland. And -­

19 under AEDPA that it was objectively unreasonable for 

this lawyer to get a psychiatrist, or whatever his 

21 status was; to get a report, which he did, and which he 

22 looked at, in which the psychiatrist or psychologist 

23 said, look, there's nothing here, and he went through 

24 all the stuff that was there; and, in fact, after the 

Federal evidentiary hearing, he said, well, in light of

1 this new evidence, I'm still correct; and objectively 

2 unreasonable for this lawyer to say, look, my best bet 

3 is to put his mother on the stand, that that might 

4 engender sympathy and portray him as not as bad a guy as 

everybody says, as opposed to putting on all this 

6 evidence that explains why he's such a bad guy. Those 

7 are two -- we've said those are reasonable choices. 

8  If you're relying on that basis, we have to 

9 decide that it is objectively unreasonable for a lawyer 

to proceed on that basis. 

11  MR. KENNEDY: Yes, and it is in the facts of 

12 this case, Mr. Chief Justice. First, counsel didn't 

13 make a reasoned strategic decision to -- to put forward 

14 a certain mitigation strategy based on the mother. 

Counsel didn't think the case was proceeding to penalty 

16 phase. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the argument 

18 that a good deal of mitigation evidence came out during 

19 the trial on the guilt?

 MR. KENNEDY: It did not come out, Justice 

21 Ginsburg. A few little pieces of information were given 

22 by Mrs. Brashear, Mr. Pinholster's mom. But there was 

23 no relationship of how his traumatic head injuries then 

24 affected him and caused him damage. And so the -- the 

presentation was incomplete. And even the State's own

1 expert, Dr. Stalberg, after he had actually seen all the 

2 documents that he would have wanted to receive if he was 

3 doing a mitigation mental health phase, he said it was 

4 profoundly misleading. And it was.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. And this goes 

6 back to Justice Scalia's question. The question which 

7 we granted -- question 1 is whether the Federal court 

8 may reject a State court adjudication of a petitioner's 

9 claim as unreasonable based on a factual predicate for 

the claim that petitioner could have presented in the 

11 State court but did not. And that describes what you're 

12 talking about in response to Justice Ginsburg. 

13  Now, the Petitioner, unaccountably, has told 

14 us a few minutes ago that this is a new claim, which I 

think changes the whole question. But it seems to me 

16 the claim is whether there's ineffective assistance of 

17 counsel by reason of the mitigation evidence. And in 

18 that case, we go back to Justice Scalia's opening 

19 question to you: Was it the court relied on different 

evidence, evidence that was not in the State hearing? 

21 And that's the question, whether or not they can do 

22 that, if this evidence could have been presented. 

23  And certainly it could have been presented. 

24  MR. KENNEDY: Well, Justice Kennedy, the 

Ninth Circuit did make alternative rulings, but turning

Official 

1 to the question of the new evidence, we believe the new 

2 evidence was properly considered, although the court 

3 made it clear that it would affirm based only on what 

4 was on State court, because that showing was so 

substantial in and of itself. 

6  But, turning to the new evidence, there is a 

7 reason things like this happen. In California, the 

8 claim was denied without any hearing and without any 

9 explanation. And then the -- the case moves to Federal 

court. And for the first time, it's the State that 

11 starts bringing forth its mental health theory to rebut 

12 the offered theory and starts to question whether or not 

13 Dr. Stalberg, who is our expert, has a neurology license 

14 and can opine on how epilepsy affects intent and 

culpability. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to pause for a 

17 moment, you said there was no hearing in the State 

18 court. Well, that was because the State court, pursuant 

19 to the established procedures, assumed everything you 

wanted to show was true. It's a little bit much. I 

21 mean, you were not going to be in any better position 

22 after a hearing than you were before the State court. 

23  MR. KENNEDY: Mr. Chief Justice, the 

24 California Supreme Court didn't tell us what I -- what 

they did. It is true that there is a procedure for

25

Official 

1 provisionally assuming facts are true. They didn't say 

2 that they did that here. 

3  And the backdrop against how this case 

4 happened in State court is we presented all of the 

allegations with affidavits in support of them, and the 

6 California Supreme Court issued an OSC, which normally 

7 means they think if the showing is true, it's got to be 

8 granted, and there has to be a hearing and a ruling that 

9 describes the reasoning.

 Then the State filed in State court 

11 documents, fairly conclusory, saying: You shouldn't 

12 believe Dr. Woods. He came into this evaluation 10 

13 years after the fact. You shouldn't believe him. You 

14 shouldn't believe trial counsel. Trial counsel was 

disbarred. 

16  And after that, the State Supreme Court 

17 withdraws the OSC and issues a postcard denial. That 

18 suggests that we didn't get the procedures that are 

19 referred to, at least from the State's perspective.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But isn't it the California 

21 rule that a hearing had to have been conducted unless 

22 they concluded that the petitioner was not entitled to 

23 relief based on the facts alleged in the petition? 

24  MR. KENNEDY: I think that's the rule, 

Justice Alito, but if that is what was done here,

1 because it is the most commonly invoked rule, it was 

2 objectively unreasonable, because in light of the 

3 presentation that was made in State court -- and I've 

4 given the Court some of it -- that was definitely a 

showing of an unreasonable application of Strickland, 

6 because -­

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, to get back to the 

8 question the Chief Justice asked before, trial counsel 

9 did consult a psychiatrist, Dr. Stalberg, and his report 

was very unfavorable. 

11  Now, it's your -- it's your argument that it 

12 was ineffective for them not to continue their search 

13 for a helpful expert and come upon Drs. Vinogradov and 

14 Olson or someone like them during that period of time? 

Is that -- is that the claim? 

16  MR. KENNEDY: I'm sorry, Justice Alito, 

17 that's not my argument. I think there are many times 

18 where it would be perfectly acceptable for trial counsel 

19 to hire a mental health expert, receive a report, and 

say, based on what we have, we're not going to use this 

21 route. 

22  But it wasn't acceptable here, because what 

23 happened here is they hired a mental health expert in 

24 the middle of the guilt phase who went down on a Sunday 

for 1 to 2 hours without any of the documents that he

4 Dr. Stalberg did not have enough information to render a 

competent psychiatric opinion. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: That's -- again, it would 

7 be helpful -- maybe you can't do this from the top of 

8 your head, but when I looked at the Ninth Circuit en 

9 banc decision, I found a long discussion on page 79 

following by Chief Judge Kozinski in dissent, from which 

11 I got the impression that the majority was not saying: 

12 We think the State court decision here was unreasonable 

13 or violated clearly established law, based on the record 

14 before the State court on habeas, State habeas.

 Now, you've just told me in the 70-page 

16 opinion by Judge Smith, there's a paragraph or something 

17 that says: Even were all this issue out of it, the 

18 extra evidence, we still think that looking just at the 

19 evidence before the State court habeas, and just at 

their decision, we think in light of all these things 

21 you now are bringing up that that was a -- was an 

22 unreasonable application of clearly established Federal 

23 law, or at least was based on an unreasonable 

24 determination of the facts; in other words, satisfied

4  MR. KENNEDY: Well, we think what happened 

here was perfectly appropriate for the court to hold a 

6 hearing. No hearing had been held in State court, and 

7 the Federal court determined that a hearing was 

8 appropriate because Pinholster had been diligent in 

9 attempting to develop the facts, and that is the test 

that this Court has set forth in Michael Williams. 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, this -- your 

12 friend pointed it out, and I have to say it's a logical 

13 conundrum for me, too -- you have to show under (e)(2) 

14 that the factual predicate could not have been 

previously discovered, and your claim is that his lawyer 

16 should have discovered this. They both can't be true. 

17 And if the former is not true, you don't get a hearing; 

18 and if the latter is not true, you don't get relief. 

19  MR. KENNEDY: Well, I guess it depends on 

how one interprets the term "factual predicate," because 

21 if we focus on mental health impairments and how 

22 impairments affect intent and culpability and how it 

23 plays out on the specific facts of the crime, Pinholster 

24 did discover those, even though he didn't have discovery 

or an evidentiary hearing. He did allege them, and he

6 don't need that view -­

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you go back to 

8 Justice Kagan's earlier question of how we draw the 

9 line? At what level of generality is sufficient to say 

that a factual basis of a claim has been developed? 

11  MR. KENNEDY: I think we draw the line by 

12 focusing on what is legally relevant, not a DSM opinion. 

13  I have to say, as a long-time public 

14 defender, my experience is that the mental health 

professionals often speak about the legally relevant 

16 facts in different ways based on the DSM, but to focus 

17 on what matters: What was his impairment? How did it 

18 affect him? 

19  He was, right before the homicides, at the 

house of a friend in an erratic state, saying he had a 

21 message from God, brandishing a knife and putting it 

22 into the door. Dr. Stalberg, who did this mid-trial 

23 evaluation, said that that was extraordinarily important 

24 to him, because it showed that this was not a cold and 

calculated murderer, as he thought when he didn't have

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose a petitioner 

6 in the State post-conviction proceeding proffers an 

7 affidavit from one mental health expert alleging one 

8 type of mental disorder, and then after relief is denied 

9 in the State court, the petitioner files in Federal 

court and asks for an evidentiary hearing at which the 

11 petitioner is going to call a dozen highly distinguished 

12 mental health experts who will testify to a very 

13 different mental disorder. Now, has the petitioner 

14 developed the factual predicate for that claim in the 

State proceeding?

17 on the facts of the case, but he's going to have a very 

18 difficult time. And that's the reason why there's -­

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But why? Explain why 

that -- the opinion is not a fact that's different. 

21  MR. KENNEDY: Because the opinion is based 

22 on facts. So the more differently the cases look, the 

23 more they focus on different underlying facts, different 

24 reasons and how they affect conduct differently, the 

more it's going to be difficult, because under this

8 you back to page 35? The -- the court of appeals' 

9 opinion, Ninth Circuit's opinion, says, "Accordingly, if 

2254(e)(2) were to limit the scope of the evidence 

11 before us, it would exclude only the new mental 

12 impairment theories" -- the new mental impairment 

13 theories -- "introduced in federal court, and their 

14 exclusion would not affect our result."

 The State contends that there -- there was 

16 other factual material, not just those theories but also 

17 the 6-and-a-half-hour time sheet evidence. 

18  MR. KENNEDY: Well -­

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: So at least, you know, that 

really doesn't cover the waterfront of -- of all new 

21 evidence. 

22  MR. KENNEDY: Well, the State also says in 

23 its reply brief that it's not just the affidavits; it's 

24 the affidavits looked -- looked at against the backdrop 

of the whole State court record.

4 also the billing sheets?

 MR. KENNEDY: Well, I -- I respectfully 

6 don't, because the billing sheets in our State -­

8 billing sheets to the court, and where the information 

9 comes from is the clerk's transcript in this case from 

the State court record.

13 billing sheets? 

14  MR. KENNEDY: No, we -- we said he didn't 

prepare at all in State court. And then when the 

16 billing sheets were revealed, Mr. Brainard, who is the 

17 lawyer who did all of the witnesses at penalty phase, 

18 has an entry, "begin preparing for penalty phase," and 

19 every one -- that entry and every one after it is

them in this case, they were -- they were exhibits 67 

6 through 72, and it's -- they were admitted because they 

7 were the records from the State court record, from the 

8 clerk's transcript. 

9  JUSTICE BREYER: But what about -­

JUSTICE KAGAN: I think what's important is 

11 that they are not -- I mean, tell me if I am wrong, but 

12 they were not part of the State court record on which 

13 the State court made the 2254(d)(1) determination; is 

14 that right?

 MR. KENNEDY: Well, the -- they were not, 

16 but the allegation was that they did nothing. So it was 

17 an even stronger allegation in State court than was 

18 ultimately pursued at the (e)(2) hearing. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: To say that they were on 

record in the State court is not to say that they were 

21 part of the record, of the trial record. And these 

22 things were not part of the trial record, right?

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's -- that 

4 gets back to the point Justice Scalia was making, is 

that this is new evidence that the Ninth Circuit 

6 considered with respect to the original. In other 

7 words, they were not just saying, okay, even if none of 

8 this happened, we'd still rule against you, because one 

9 of the new things they had was the 6-hour evidence, 

which you've just said makes your case stronger. I 

11 think it does make your case stronger, but it also makes 

12 clear that we can't say let's just look -- the Ninth 

13 Circuit just looked at what was there originally. 

14  MR. KENNEDY: Well, I think you can, because 

the Ninth Circuit -- I mean, if you look at the -- if 

16 the Court looks at the allegations in State court, there 

17 were -- the allegations regarding counsel's performance 

18 was that they did not believe that they were going to a 

19 penalty phase; that, because they did not look at the 

prosecutor's open file, they did not know that their 

21 theory that they would not have a penalty phase was

8 clear as possible. Justice Scalia read the sentence on 

9 page 35. I read the heading from what Judge Kozinski 

says, "Our review is limited to the record presented in 

11 the state habeas petitions." That's what he says. 

12  All right. Now, you told me that the 

13 sentence he read means the majority there says if our 

14 record is limited to the record -- our review is limited 

to the record presented in the State habeas petitions, 

16 you still win. 

17  MR. KENNEDY: Yes. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. But that's not what 

19 it said. It said exactly what Justice Scalia said it 

said, so -- which is talking about the evidence coming 

21 in under (e)(2) or something. Now, I see a nightmare in 

22 front of me where I have to go through hundreds or

presented in the State habeas petition.

2  JUSTICE BREYER: And I can ask you, is that 

3 conceded on both sides? 

4  MR. KENNEDY: Well, what the Ninth Circuit 

majority was saying is that if there was some bar that 

6 (e)(2) had to holding a hearing where new evidence could 

7 be properly presented, that it wouldn't matter, because 

8 based on the record before it in State court, it proved 

9 a Strickland violation under Williams, Wiggins, and 

Rompilla; and it was objectively unreasonable. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that -- that was 

12 on the assumption that the only new evidence would have 

13 been the evidence of -- how did they put it? "The new 

14 mental impairment theories introduced in federal court." 

That that's the only new evidence that would be -- would 

16 be excluded. And the other side contradicts that. 

17  MR. KENNEDY: Well, but I'm -- I'm sorry. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, could I just 

19 ask one clarifying question? In the Second Circuit for 

many years, you had the record on appeal which the 

21 parties prepared, but you also had the record below 

22 which was sent automatically to the judges to review as 

23 well. The billing records that we're talking about -­

24 you say they were part of the record below -- would that 

automatically have been sent under California law to the

1 reviewing court? 

2  MR. KENNEDY: Yes, because it's the same -­

3 we have automatic appeals, and the habeas is done in 

4 front of the Supreme Court. So the entire record, I 

believe, is before the California Supreme Court, and 

6 it's also my understanding that the State makes the same 

7 argument in its reply brief, that it's not just 

8 Pinholster's allegations; it's Pinholster's allegations 

9 considered against the total record.

 But even if the specific allegation of 

11 6.5 hours was not there, the allegation was that counsel 

12 had done nothing to prepare, that they had not spent any 

13 time preparing because they wrongly believed that they 

14 were not in a death penalty -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I wouldn't believe that. I 

16 mean, you had nothing to support it. I mean, I'd say 

17 that's just lawyer's puffery -­

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- whereas you come up with 

a record that shows 6.5 hours. I mean, that's 

21 something. 

22  MR. KENNEDY: Your Honor, the lawyers made 

23 this revelation in court at trial in front of the 

24 famously aggressive prosecutor and the trial judge, who 

knew these lawyers and had sat through the hearing, and

1 no one had any suggestion that it was puffery or it was 

2 false. In fact, the trial prosecutor started 

3 to staunchly defend her conduct by saying, look, I 

4 offered them to look at my file and they didn't show up. 

Which sounds, you know, strikingly similar to Rompilla, 

6 where counsel doesn't even look at the file that will 

7 reveal that their whole defense is problematic and built 

8 on a lie. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How long does it 

take to read Dr. Stalberg's report that says I've looked 

11 at this, I've examined this, this, and this, and there's 

12 nothing here that's going to support a mental impairment 

13 theory? 

14  MR. KENNEDY: It's very short, but the 

report, when they read that quick report on its face, 

16 they had to know that he wasn't prepared enough to 

17 render an opinion. He seemed not to know about this 

18 incident about I have a message from God and all of the 

19 drinking and drug use beforehand. And the report 

doesn't even mention the head injuries, being run over 

21 by his mother and going through the window. Counsel had 

22 to know these things, first, because that witness 

23 testimony had occurred days before Dr. Stalberg's Sunday 

24 interview. And, two, at least at some point in time the 

mother said these things happened, and they had to know

predicate that could not have been previously discovered 

6 in this case? 

7  MR. KENNEDY: The factual predicate that 

8 could not be discovered was the evolution of the mental 

9 health testimonies, as it moved from affidavit to live 

testimony, and the State gave for the first time 

11 specific notice of how it was going to attack the 

12 presentation in State court. And all of the arguably 

13 new mental health theories were in response to the 

14 changes in -- that the State itself had made in Federal 

court.

 However, there were important -- indeed, the 

21 most important records, that might have shed light on

to was the billing records. What -- do the billing 

6 records dispute that or not? 

7  MR. BILDERBACK: Yes. The billing 

8 records -­

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So I'm assuming -- I 

have to assume -- I don't have to assume, but it's not 

11 new evidence. They had it before them. 

12  MR. BILDERBACK: The billing records -­

13 again, the billing records upon which the Ninth Circuit 

14 arrived at its conclusion that there were only 6 and a 

half hours was before the State court. However, the 

16 allegation that there were only 6 and a half hours spent 

17 in preparation was never presented to State court, and, 

18 indeed, the records presented to the State court were 

19 incomplete in a way that would not admit to that 

conclusion. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: If you're relying on 

22 allegations rather than the evidence, the allegation was 

23 even worse. The allegation was zip. 

24  MR. BILDERBACK: Exactly.

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, exactly, that doesn't 

3 help you. 

4  MR. BILDERBACK: No, it does, Your Honor, 

because that allegation was plainly false, based upon 

6 the State court record. The State doesn't blindly 

7 accept any factual allegation made in the petition. It 

8 -- it reviews those allegations in light of the State 

9 court record.

 And, in this case, as the Court indicates, 

11 the State court record plainly showed that the 

12 allegation that they did nothing to prepare for the 

13 penalty phase was false, and, indeed, the State court 

14 records showed that they began preparing for the penalty 

phase well before the penalty phase began. 

16  So the factual allegation that was presented 

17 to the State court was not only false, based on the 

18 State court record; it was affirmatively disproved 

19 during the Federal evidentiary hearing. It's very 

difficult to see how we can arrive at the conclusion 

21 that the State court determination was unreasonable, 

22 when in fact it was correct. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: Is this right, then?

3 wrong. We have to look through the evidence and say 

4 that was wrong. Then you're at first base.

 MR. BILDERBACK: Yes. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: And to get home, we now 

7 have to look at the new evidence, and there it's some 

8 combination of (a) there was nothing to have a hearing 

9 about because there's nothing here that lets you have a 

hearing; or (b) there was something to have a hearing 

11 about because this was so new that it was a new claim, 

12 and you should have gone to the State court first on 

13 that one, but there's no room to do it. They don't let 

14 you do it.

 So, okay, judge in the Federal court, you 

16 have the hearing, and now, when you have the hearing, 

17 first see if there was the diligence. And there wasn't. 

18 That gets you home. That's the whole argument. 

19  MR. BILDERBACK: The only point with which I 

would -- I would take issue with the Court's 

21 characterization is -- I assume the Court was not 

22 speaking hypothetically. The Court is speaking about my

8 court made in doing the (d)(1) -- in failing to do the 

9 (d)(1) determination at all and in taking evidence in 

clear derogation of (e)(2). If you ever take evidence
