 [10:48 a.m.]

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 05-1631, Scott versus Harris.

 Mr. Savrin.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP W. SAVRIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SAVRIN: Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court:

 This case concerns whether a police officer 

could be held personally liable for using force to 

terminate a dangerous high-speed pursuit. The 

undisputed facts show that Deputy Scott did not violate 

the Fourth Amendment. Respondent had led the police 

officers on a nine-mile pursuit at exceptionally high 

speeds. As the videotapes that have been admitted in 

evidence show, Respondent was driving on narrow two-lane 

roads at night. He swerved across the double line to 

pass cars that were in his path, actually traveling in 

the wrong lane of travel. He ran through a number of 

red lights. He weaved through a shopping center and 

collided with Deputy Scott's vehicle.

 Deputy Scott at that point had tried to 

block the exit from the shopping center, but Mr. Harris 

was successful in using his vehicle to escape. At that

point, he continued driving at exceptionally high 

speeds.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask this question 

about the shopping center. Wouldn't your case be 

exactly the same if the shopping center incident had not 

occurred?

 MR. SAVRIN: It would, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So that we really don't 

have to get distracted by the shopping center?

 MR. SAVRIN: There is a -- yes, Your Honor. 

There is a factual dispute as far as whether Deputy 

Scott's vehicle collided with Mr. Harris' vehicle or 

vice versa, but we do not believe that that is a 

material dispute. We believe that the fact, the 

undisputed fact, that Mr. Harris was driving at such 

exceptionally high rate of speeds -- and to put in 

context, 90 miles per hour, which is the average speed, 

and of course --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not sure why you 

concede that. I mean, I looked at the case and it 

seemed to me it's a case involving the whole ball of 

wax. And I suspect my reaction to that tape was in part 

affected by the fact that he went through the shopping 

center, came out and crashed into a police car, which is 

what Scott saw.

MR. SAVRIN: But Scott -- yes, Your Honor, I 

think that is part of the analysis.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So how do I know whether, 

which of these things is directly or not indirectly --

well, you go ahead. But I mean, are you -- am I not 

supposed to look at the part which involves the shopping 

center?

 MR. SAVRIN: Absolutely, Your Honor. My 

point was that, the point was that there was a 

collision, not who caused the collision, whether the 

deputy pulled into Mr. Harris' line of travel or 

Mr. Harris pulled towards the deputy.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the rule that you 

propose that the policeman must balance the risk of harm 

to others versus the risk of harm to the fleeing person?

 MR. SAVRIN: Your Honor -- yes, essentially.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Your brief says that the 

officer reasonably believes that doing so, i.e., 

terminating the chase, would avoid a greater risk of 

bodily injury or death.

 MR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor. And we 

believe --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Greater than what? 

Greater than --

MR. SAVRIN: Greater than not taking action.

In other words, that the harm --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Without reference to the 

possible harm to the driver? I just want to know what 

you're testing.

 MR. SAVRIN: I think that -- I think that is 

one of the factors to be considered.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know that I agree 

with that. I mean, if this fellow driving 90 miles an 

hour is responsible for endangering people, you're 

proposing a rule that says if there's a 50 percent 

chance that he'll hurt some innocent person and a 50 

percent chance that he'll get hurt if you try to stop 

him, you shouldn't do anything. I don't agree with 

that.

 MR. SAVRIN: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'd stop him. I mean, he's 

the fellow that's causing the danger, endangerment, 

isn't he?

 MR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor, I would agree 

with that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you're giving away 

too much.

 MR. SAVRIN: One thing I did want to point 

out is that a speed of 90 miles per hour -- and of 

course there's evidence in the record that the vehicles

were at times traveling over 100 miles an hour --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't mean to put words 

in your mouth. It seems to me your test might be 

whether there is a greater risk in stopping him or not 

stopping him as to other people, without reference to 

the risk to himself.

 MR. SAVRIN: Yes, that's probably a better 

articulation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's your brief. I 

want you to --

MR. SAVRIN: I think that's a better 

articulation of what the appropriate test would be, the 

way --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, isn't the speed also 

relevant to the likelihood that -- that running into a 

car at that speed would cause the death of a driver?

 MR. SAVRIN: It would, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it a fair high 

probability that if you hit someone at that speed that 

there will be something, either death or serious injury 

as a result?

 MR. SAVRIN: Your Honor, my answer to that 

question would be that that's always going to be the 

case whenever force is used to stop a vehicle at this 

high rate of speed.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I suppose there is 

also a high probability where you're going 90 miles an 

hour on a one-way road, crossing over the double yellow 

line, with oncoming traffic, that you're going to hurt 

somebody else.

 MR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the more you 

increase the speed the more likely he's going to be 

hurt. But also the more likely if you let him go 

somebody else is going to be hurt.

 MR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor. And to put it 

in a more complete perspective, 90 miles an hour is 

mathematically equivalent to over 130 feet per second.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mr. Savrin, there was 

an episode in the parking lot where things came to a 

temporary halt. If Scott had stopped pursuing Harris at 

that point, maybe Harris would not -- maybe he would 

have slowed down. If he was -- he was trying to flee 

from the police, but if the police weren't after him 

there is no indication that he would have been speeding.

 MR. SAVRIN: Well, Your Honor, I would 

disagree with that, that in fact --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he was 

speeding before the police knew about him, right? 

That's the whole, where this all started.

MR. SAVRIN: The initial offense was 

speeding, and Mr. Harris, instead of pulling over or 

slowing down as would might be expected by a reasonable 

person, sped up and continued to drive recklessly.

 We would contend that it was Mr. Harris that 

was in control of the force that the officers need to 

terminate, the risk that he presented. At any time, any 

time, Mr. Harris could have either slowed down his 

vehicle or stopped, and he chose not to do that.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, do you contend that 

an officer can always use deadly force to stop a 

high-speed driver who's creating this kind of a risk?

 MR. SAVRIN: I think it depends on how you 

define deadly force. Of course, there can be different 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Running into him with a 

high probability that he'll get killed.

 MR. SAVRIN: I think that, that would be the 

case, as I indicated, whenever an officer uses force to 

stop a vehicle at this speed. I think there is -- if it 

is deadly force, and of course this Court has not 

articulated a test of that particular question --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Wasn't that acknowledged 

in the district court, in the trial court?

 MR. SAVRIN: In this case?

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the jury might find 

that it was deadly force.

 MR. SAVRIN: The Eleventh Circuit found that 

the jury might conclude it was deadly force.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And do you conclude that 

the jury could not find that it was deadly force?

 MR. SAVRIN: I believe, again, Your Honor, I 

believe that it depends on how broad the test is. The 

Model Penal Code test, which most of the circuit 

courts --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but is your -- is 

it your view that a jury could not find on these facts 

that there was deadly force?

 MR. SAVRIN: I believe, yes, under, under 

the test as articulated in some of the circuits, yes, 

this would not be deadly force. Of course, what we're 

saying is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought we had a test 

for deadly force in Garner and it's whether or not there 

is -- it's more likely than not, whether or not there is 

a serious risk that death will ensue. That's the test, 

Garner.

MR. SAVRIN: Your Honor, as I read the 

Garner opinion, the court did not need to reach a 

definition of deadly force because shooting someone in 

the back of the head is clearly going to be deadly 

force. The circuit courts -- I can tell you that the 

circuit courts in the wake of Garner have said that 

Garner did not create a test and have created different 

tests along the lines of the Model Penal Code to reach 

that definition. But the point -- I was going to say a 

point that I would like to make is that there are 

degrees even within the continuum that might be within a 

definition of deadly force, such as using a vehicle to 

make contact, blowing out the tires, using stop sticks, 

using a firearm. Those have different degrees of 

potential lethality, so even if they are all considered 

deadly force there are decisions that an officer has to 

make.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What test, what of deadly 

force would not be met here?

 MR. SAVRIN: A likelihood -- -

JUSTICE ALITO: Considering that it's a 

summary judgment issue.

 MR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor. I would say 

that the Third Circuit decision in the Philadelphia 

litigation case, where the officers dropped a bomb on a

building in order to gain access and they ended up 

killing 11 people. The Court found that that was not 

deadly force because the officers were trying to gain 

access to the building and they reasonably believe that 

they were able to do that without the loss of life. I 

think that if that definition were applied to this case, 

then I think that this would not be deadly force. But I 

think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Finish that.

 MR. SAVRIN: I'm sorry. I keep interrupting 

you.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. He reasonably 

-- because Scott reasonably believed that he could bump 

the car off the road at 90 miles an hour without risking 

the driver's life? Is that why it's like the Third 

Circuit case?

 MR. SAVRIN: Your Honor, his intent was to 

end the pursuit, not to cause an accident.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but the Third Circuit 

case you just described didn't talk about intent. It 

talked about reasonable belief.

 MR. SAVRIN: Well, let me cite another case 

then, the Adams case from the Eleventh Circuit.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Before do you that, will 

you go back to the Philadelphia case. Do you contend

that a jury could find that he reasonably believed that 

he would not cause, that he would not raise a serious 

risk of death or serious bodily harm by bumping the car 

at 90 miles an hour?

 MR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor. And if I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't understand that. 

How could such a belief be reasonable? What am I 

missing here?

 MR. SAVRIN: Let me cite the Court to the 

Eleventh Circuit's own reasoning in the Adams case. And 

that case involves a misdemeanant where the officer 

intentionally made contact with the vehicle several 

times. The last contact caused the death of a 

passenger. The Eleventh Circuit found that Garner did 

not apply to that situation and further said that a 

policeman's use of his vehicle is very different from a 

policeman's use of his gun.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That doesn't answer my 

question.

 MR. SAVRIN: I'm sorry, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why, why would it be 

reasonable to believe that a car could be bumped at 90 

miles an hour plus without raising a substantial risk of 

death or serious bodily harm? How could such a belief 

be reasonable?

MR. SAVRIN: Because there are vehicle 

collisions every day, Your Honor, that do not end in 

death or serious bodily harm.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Some people are lucky. 

We're talking about creating a substantial risk. How 

would it be reasonable to assume that one would not 

create a substantial risk?

 MR. SAVRIN: Your Honor, because Mr. Harris 

could have regained control of his vehicle. The point 

is that Mister -- that the Petitioner had limited 

options based on the manner in which Mr. Harris was 

driving. Even if this would be considered deadly force, 

we do believe it would be justified under the 

circumstances.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's a different 

issue and you may prevail on other arguments in the 

case. But as to whether or not there's a likelihood or 

a reasonable likelihood of serious injury, it seems to 

me that's clearly a question for the jury. I mean, we 

might argue about it up here, but that's classic jury 

question, isn't it?

 MR. SAVRIN: I believe in the context of the 

Fourth Amendment and the Graham factors and the question 

of probable cause, that it's not the same as simply a 

jury question. But I do concede that if it's not deadly

force it's very close to it. But I think the important 

thing is that, whatever force Mister -- the Petitioner 

used was limited by Mr. Harris' driving.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Savrin, one technique 

that Officer Scott asked permission to use was described 

as a PIT technique that would be a life and limb-

sparing measure. One oddity about this case is that he 

called and asked permission to use that less risky 

method and yet when he determined that he couldn't do 

that, given the speed of the vehicles, he didn't ask 

permission to do what he did do, which was 

life-endangering.

 MR. SAVRIN: Your Honor, if I could respond 

to that in two respects. First, it is not, it is not 

the case that the PIT maneuver, as it's commonly called, 

is safe. What it does is spin the car out, and if 

Mr. Harris' vehicle had been spun out in this case it is 

more likelihood that he would have lost control. In 

other words, it causes the vehicle to lose control.

 The second response I would have is that the 

Petitioner did ask permission to do the PIT maneuver and 

the permission that the supervisor gave, which was Mr. 

Faninger that's in the record undisputed, was to use 

force up to deadly force. So Mr. --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is that?

MR. SAVRIN: That's in Mark Faninger's 

deposition, and he is the supervisor that was ---

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And he said he gave 

permission for more than PIT procedure?

 MR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor. His testimony 

was that he was giving, he believes he was giving 

permission up to and including deadly force.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the phrase used was 

"take him out," wasn't it?

 MR. SAVRIN: Yes. Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Does a police officer have 

any obligation in a situation like this to consider 

other alternatives, and if so what other alternatives 

might have been available to this officer?

 MR. SAVRIN: Yes, Justice Stevens. I think 

the officer had very limited options, two options at 

that point: Either use force or let Mr. Harris go. And 

I think it was a balancing of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And even with letting him 

go, isn't it possible they could get other roadblocks up 

ahead or get other people involved in the attempt to 

catch him?

 MR. SAVRIN: Yes, there always are other 

potentials. However, I would submit that a vehicle 

traveling at 130 feet per second can do a lot of damage

in a very short period of time before the police 

officers can figure out what route he's going to take.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it true that there's 

no traffic on the road at that particular time?

 MR. SAVRIN: Deputy Scott took the action 

that he did because there was a low likelihood of injury 

to third parties other than to Mr. Harris because there 

was no one in his immediate path of travel.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, in that circumstance 

why wouldn't he just consider discontinuing the chase?

 MR. SAVRIN: Because there were -- the 

videotape shows that Mr. Harris passed approximately 36 

cars during this period of time. 12 seconds before the 

contact was made, a vehicle was passed by Mr. Harris. 

There was a high likelihood, in fact a probability, that 

this case was going to end in tragedy, and Deputy Scott 

took the action that he could.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would that have been 

likely if the officer had discontinued the chase?

 MR. SAVRIN: Whether he discontinued the 

chase or not, Mr. Harris could still injure whoever 

might be around the next corner, Your Honor.

 If there are no further questions, I'd like 

to save my time for rebuttal.

 Mr. Garre?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE.

 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

 SUPPORTING PETITIONER

 MR. GARRE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 When a suspect disobeys a lawful command to 

stop, races off in a reckless attempt to elude the 

police, and demonstrates a disregard for his own life 

and the lives of others in his path, the police may use 

force, including deadly force, to bring the suspect's 

vehicle flight to a halt and protect the public safety.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it matter 

exactly what the nature of the escape was? Are we 

supposed to evaluate whether this was reckless enough? 

Well, let's say the driver did not go off 90 miles an 

hour. Let's say he obeyed the speed limit. He just 

wasn't going to stop. Does that make it a different 

case?

 MR. GARRE: It does, Your Honor. The key 

determination is whether the officer on the scene 

reasonably determines that the vehicle poses a 

substantial risk to other motorists or the police in his 

way.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I would think that would 

apply to all high-speed cases; would you not agree?

 MR. GARRE: I agree that it does, Justice 

Kennedy. Here what you have is an individual who's 

going extraordinarily high speeds, 80 to 100 miles an 

hour. An individual who has passed cars, crossed the 

double, double line; there were numerous motors, motor 

vehicles on the night. And an individual who has ran 

red lights, an individual who when three police cars --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. But that was while 

he was being chased, right? Before being chased he 

hadn't done any of this. He was going 72 miles an hour 

in a 55-mile zone, isn't that right.

 MR. GARRE: Well, that's true, Your Honor. 

But as the Court said in the Sacramento versus Lewis 

case, we don't blame police for the individual's 

reckless flight in that context. We don't blame police 

that Respondent made a decision to just --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No but if you're thinking 

of the likelihood of harm if they discontinued the 

chase, is it not reasonable to assume he might go back 

to going 72 miles an hour in a 55-mile zone?

 MR. GARRE: Not on this record, Justice 

Stevens. In this particular --

reasonable to assume that anyone who was chased by the 

police will immediately speed up to 90 miles an hour.

 MR. GARRE: That's exactly right, Justice Sc 

alia.

 JUSTICE SC ALIA: It doesn't seem to me a 

very good rule to give to police forces: Anybody who's 

going 72 miles an hour, let him go. Or at least if he 

hits 90, let him go.

 MR. GARRE: We agree, Justice Scalia. As 

Justice Kennedy put it Sacramento versus Lewis, if 

there's a real danger --

JUSTICE STEVENS: There isn't a question. 

There is a question of whether it justifies the use of 

deadly force, to prevent this -- this situation.

 MR. GARRE: The question in our mind, 

Justice Stevens, is whether Deputy Scott reasonably 

believed that Respondent posed a serious risk of injury 

or death to other motor vehicles, bystanders or police 

on the roadway that night.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why are these absolute? I 

mean I looked at Garner and then I looked at Graham and 

Graham which came later said that all claims that 

officers have used excessive force, deadly or not, 

should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment and its 

reasonableness standard. So I guess-- isn't that right,

isn't that the law?

 MR. GARRE: We agree, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, if that's the 

law, then whether -- of course an automobile could, 

could kill people. Of course it can. So can a lot of 

things. But an automobile isn't a gun, and a chase on 

the highway is not a chase through a back yard, though 

both could end up with the person being chased dead.

 So aren't we supposed to look at all the 

circumstances, including the circumstance of what -- one 

that interests me, one, is that the right standard? 

Two, did Scott know that the reason he was chasing this 

person was because he had violated a speed limit, or was 

he ignorant of the reason why the individual was racing 

away at 90 miles an hour, which is as far as the record 

could show?

 MR. GARRE: Justice Breyer, to answer the 

second question first, Scott did not know that he was 

initially in a chase.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And a reasonable juror 

could not conclude to the contrary?

 MR. GARRE: Well, Scott, I believe, Scott's 

testimony was that he did not know. What Scott knew, 

and he was engaged in the chase, was this is an 

individual who had crossed cars, crossed the double

yellow line. This was an individual who had ran red 

lights. This was an individual, when three police squad 

cars converged on him in the shopping center parking 

lot, collided with them and ran off into the highway, 

reaching again speeds up to 90 miles an hour.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it reasonable for 

him to suppose that there might be something more going 

on if the guy is trying this hard to get away from a 

speeding ticket? That presents he presents a danger to 

the community quite apart from the driving?

 MR. GARRE: Absolutely.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is that a factor 

that goes into the analysis?

 MR. GARRE: It is, certainly, at a 

commonsense level. Statistic show that most vehicles 

who flee in this fashion, oftentimes there is alcohol or 

drug abuse involved, oftentimes they are stolen 

vehicles. We don't think --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What if they knew there 

were drugs in the car that he would dispose of if he had 

got caught. Would that justify this using deadly force?

 MR. GARRE: I'm not sure that it would, 

Justice Scalia -- uh, Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm rather clear it would 

not, isn't it? Because that would be no more serious

than the crime in Garner, would it?

 MR. GARRE: Well -- that's true. The key, 

the key point about this case is the threat that 

Respondent posed in the -- suspects who engage in high 

speed vehicle chases pose to the public, and that is, 

that is fundamentally different from Garner for the 

reason that you mentioned. Garner involved --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your position would be 

the same even if Scott knew that the only reason they 

were trying to stop him initially was the speeding 

violation?

 MR. GARRE: Yes. It doesn't matter why the 

chase began. The point is that when Scott made the 

decision to use force against Respondent, he reasonably 

determined that Respondent posed a grave threat to other 

motorists, the police and any bystanders who might come 

in his way.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why, why wouldn't it 

matter? I mean, other things being equal, suppose that 

he known that all that happens, suppose he was two miles 

beyond the speed limit. And Scott knew the whole thing 

or Scott was the one who did it, and he says maybe he is 

a young kid who is frightened and he has his license 

number and he could get him later. I mean, why wouldn't 

it be nutty to -- to try to bump somebody off the road,

when all, that's all that's at stake?

 MR. GARRE: Because, Your Honor, regardless 

of the reason the chase began, at the moment that Deputy 

Scott used the force, this car posed a serious risk to 

everyone else on the road that night. Someone traveling 

90 miles an hour, up to 90 miles an hour, on a two-lane 

windy road with numerous cars passing during this course 

of the chase, it was that threat that Deputy Scott acted 

against when he used that force, and that was a 

reasonable use of force. It's reasonable regardless of 

whether or not this Court determines --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do you deal with the 

Brower case? That it was a 193 -- 83 action against the 

police for setting up a roadblock to catch a speeder. 

And the Court said that the roadblock was enough to give 

rise to a 1983 claim?

 MR. GARRE: Justice Ginsburg, the holding in 

that case was that a roadblock amounted to a seizure. 

And we don't, no one disputes there was a seizure in 

this case when Deputy Scott intentionally used force to 

put Respondents off the road. So it respect, Brower 

doesn't speak to the question in this case, which is 

whether or not that use of force was reasonable under 

the circumstances.

Lewis case, in his concurring opinion, say that there 

was a real danger of adopting a constitutional rule that 

suspects are free to disobey lawful commands.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just make this one 

point? Is it correct that the issue is whether it's 

reasonable or is the issue whether a jury could find it 

unreasonable?

 MR. GARRE: Well, the -- ultimately to 

determine whether this decision could be made at the 

summary judgment stage you would have to consider 

whether a jury could find it unreasonable. Here, on the 

relevant undisputed facts, we submit as a matter of law, 

Deputy Scott reasonably believed that this force was 

necessary under the circumstances.

 And the final point that I wanted to make, 

going back to Justice Kennedy's concurrence, is that 

there is a real danger in adopting that kind of 

constitutional rule, that it will encourage more 

suspects to flee, and will only increase the danger to 

the public and to police and to motorists in these high 

speed chases. I would urge this Court to reverse the 

decision below. If there are no further questions --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG T. JONES,

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 MR. JONES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court.

 I'd like to begin by responding to some of 

the questions that were asked of Petitioner. First of 

all, Officer Scott himself admitted in his testimony 

that he knew at the time that he was using deadly force, 

and he realized at the time that he was likely to cause 

injury or -- death or serious injury to Mr. Harris.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any doubt 

that Mr. Harris was likely to cause death or serious 

injury to the other cars on the highway that he was 

passing?

 MR. JONES: Mr. Harris was simply a -- an 

unsafe driver. There is always a risk at driving in 

excess of speed limit, driving in violation of traffic 

laws. But that risk in and of itself is not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We are not talking 

about driving in violation of traffic laws. We talking 

about 90 miles an hour on a two-lane highway, swerving 

past cars in the incoming traffic --

MR. JONES: Well, we're talking --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Hitting -- after 

hitting Officer Scott's car and continuing on. That's a

little more than just unsafe.

 MR. JONES: Well, those are not the facts 

before the Court, Mr. Chief Justice. The facts are that 

he was driving fast but he was under control. He only 

crossed the center line to pass and when he passed, he 

used his turn signal when he passed.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: He used the turning 

signal. That's like the strangler who observes the no 

smoking sign.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. JONES: When he turned into the -- when 

he turned into the shopping center he wasn't weaving 

through a parking lot. He was going through a private 

access road in a shopping mall which was closed at 11 

o'clock at night. And the collision, the impact 

occurred when Officer Scott, who was going too fast to 

make the turn into the shopping center, went up to the 

next intersection, came around the other way to head my 

client off at the pass. And then what happened was that 

Mr. Harris took evasive action to a avoid collision when 

Mr. Harris -- excuse me when Officer Scott -- put 

himself right in Mr. Harris' way.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Jones, I looked at the 

videotape on this. It seemed to me that he created a 

tremendous risk of drivers on that road. Is that an

unreasonable way of looking at the -- at this tape?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He created the scariest 

chase I ever saw since "The French Connection."

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is frightening.

 MR. JONES: As a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: A frightening amount of 

speed, and cars coming in the opposite direction, at 

night, on a two-lane windy road --

MR. JONES: Well, as the Court below found, 

and as the tape indicates, Mr. Harris didn't run anybody 

off the road. He didn't ram anybody. He didn't try to 

ram anybody. He was just driving away.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The question was whether he 

was creating a substantial risk doing that.

 MR. JONES: He was creating --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And my, my question is how 

could a jury find otherwise? Your answer up to this 

point is that well, he used signal lights and his 

reflexes were good, and they sure were. But the 

question is whether he was creating a substantial risk 

of death or serious bodily harm to others. And my 

question is leaving -- assuming that his reflexes were 

good and he knew how to use the signal lights, how could 

the jury fail to find that he was creating such a risk?

MR. JONES: Well, the jury could certainly 

find he's creating a risk. But with regard to the other 

Garner factors that must be shown before deadly force 

can be used, he had not committed a violent felony, a 

crime involving the infliction or threat of infliction 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Garner was not talking 

about someone who at the time the deadly force was used 

was himself creating a substantial risk of death or 

serious bodily harm to others. That's what we are 

dealing with here. And the reasonableness of the 

officer's action depends on whether, at the summary 

judgment stage, a jury can reasonably find that, in 

fact, he was not creating at that moment, a substantial 

risk of serious bodily harm or death to others. And my 

question is, how could a jury find anything else?

 MR. JONES: Well, a jury could find that the 

pursuit by the officer escalated the risk rather than 

diminishing the risk to others. And that given a choice 

between using deadly force to terminate a pursuit where 

the officer himself had escalated the risk versus 

backing off, letting the offender escape and then 

perhaps arresting him an hour later at the house.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Did Scott, know that? Did 

Scott -- Do you have evidence to show that Scott knew

that the underlying offense was a speeding violation?

 MR. JONES: We have evidence that it was

Whether Scott knew we don't know.

didn't know it.

JUSTICE BREYER: That doesn't sound like yes 

or no.

 MR. JONES: I'm not certain I understand the 

question.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The question is, can you 

get to the jury on the question of whether Scott knew 

that the underlying offense was for speeding?

 MR. JONES: Scott did not know that was it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If Scott didn't 

know it, I mean, my goodness, then I don't see the 

relevance of whether it was speeding or not. And I was

below. And I read the other brief. I was on the other 

side. Then I've been shifting back and forth. Then I 

look at that tape, and I have to say that when I looked 

at the tape, my reaction was somewhat similar to Justice 

Alito's. And so if it's doubtful and then you can't 

even show that the person who did it knew that this was 

for speeding rather than for murder, how can you get to 

the jury?

 MR. JONES: Well, there is certainly a 

credibility issue as to whether Scott says he knew or 

didn't know. I mean, certainly the call on the radio he 

could have acquired. The thing is that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as the Chief Justice 

indicated through a question earlier, isn't it 

reasonable for an officer to assume that it is -- he is 

trying to escape because there is something more serious 

than speeding at stake? I mean, that's the assumption I 

would draw.

 MR. JONES: That assumption would not be 

based upon probability or based upon police training. 

Officers in pursuit situations are trying to believe --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean just as many 

people take off in high speed chases for speeding as for 

serious crimes?

 MR. JONES: The vast majority have committed

minor crimes. And it's not a rational --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But at the moment Scott 

came into this case, what difference does that make? 

Why is that even relevant? Let's assume Scott knew that 

this entire situation had eventuated out of an 18 mile 

in excess of speed act by the individual. Assume that.

 What Scott also knew at the point at which 

he joined the chase was that this individual was driving 

a car at 90 miles an hour.  He was crossing yellow 

lines, going through red lights, et cetera. At that 

point, wasn't the only legally relevant data whether or 

not Harris was creating the risk of death or bodily harm 

to others?

 MR. JONES: That's the issue. Was there an 

immediate risk of death or serious bodily harm --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So you agree that whether 

Scott knew or didn't know, that this whole scenario had 

eventuated out of a speeding situation was irrelevant?

 MR. JONES: It's not relevant. It's 

relevant to that termination. Yeah, the issue is, is 

there an immediate risk. But one of the factors that is 

significant is what is the severity of the underlying 

crime. And if it is a crime of violence, then certainly 

the officer is entitled to presume --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly where I

started. And I wondered -- that's what I'm uncertain 

about the standard for this. Because as you and the 

others have been arguing, if the question is one about 

rules surrounding the use of deadly force. But then 

when I read what I read out to you, in Graham, it seemed 

to me that Graham, which comes after Garner, says that's 

not the standard. Graham is a standard of simple 

reasonableness and Garner is simply an illustration of 

that as applied to guns and a backyard chase, not as 

applied to cars which threaten other people much more.

 MR. JONES: Well, that's a good question.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what is the standard? 

Am I supposed to apply -- am I not supposed to apply 

Graham?

 MR. JONES: Well, whether you apply Garner 

or Graham, the result is the same in this case. And let 

me explain why. What Graham did is it expanded the 

Garner rule, which you can't use deadly force to stop a 

fleeing suspect who is merely fleeing, expanded that to 

include the entire range of use of force, deadly or 

nondeadly.

 And with regard to the factors that are to 

be considered in determining whether the use of force is 

reasonable under Graham, the balance with respect to a 

fleeing suspect who is subjected to deadly force was

already drawn by Garner. Garner created a bright light 

rule. Graham extended that to an ad hoc balancing test 

with all use of force applications. But with respect to 

deadly force and a fleeing suspect, Garner still 

provides a bright line rule.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying I cannot 

do the following under the law, which would seem to be 

contrary to common sense, to say there is a big 

difference between a policeman shooting a person who is 

running away and threatens no harm to others, and a 

policeman using a gun -- using a car on a highway to try 

to get a person to stop who is threatening others. I 

have to treat those exactly as if they were the same 

thing.

 MR. JONES: Yes. And Garner, this Court's 

decision in Garner and this Court's decision in Brower, 

which was written by Justice Scalia, basically to quote 

Brower in both cases. In the Brower versus County of 

Inyo --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Eleventh Circuit 

gave the exact opposite answer in the Adams case, which 

if you're looking at what the -- was clearly established 

law from the point of view of the officer that provides 

him guidance that the Garner case does not dictate a 

result in the use of deadly force in the police chase

case involving an automobile.

 MR. JONES: Well, the holding of the Adams 

versus St. Lucie County case was that in 1985, an 

incident which occurred six weeks after the Garner 

decision and four years before the Brower decision, 

there is no way the officers could have known at that 

time that their act of ramming a police car to prevent 

an escape of another fleeing vehicle would have been 

considered deadly force in violation of the Fourth 

Amendment. As the dissent pointed out in the, in the 

Adams case, though, certainly as of the Court's decision 

in 1993, this was now clearly established. You had 

Brower saying that it's a seizure, and then you had this 

Court saying that now the law was clearly established 

where it wasn't before --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when Officer 

Scott was trying to figure out what the law was, he 

should have relied on the dissent in the case?

 MR. JONES: Well, another case came about 

later which held that as early as 1998 in another case 

involving the same department, that there was clearly 

established law.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any case at the 

time of the action in this case, any decision that said 

ramming, ramming a car to end a chase violates the

 MR. JONES: Brower versus County of Inyo 

says --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Brower was a roadblock 

case.

 MR. JONES: It was a roadblock which 

produced a collision, a physical impact between 

vehicles. And that was the -- that was the distinction 

which Justice Scalia latched onto in that case, and said 

that the mere fact that the person was fleeing by car in 

Brower was no different than the burglar fleeing by foot 

in Garner. Either one of them --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But the issue in the case 

was quite simply whether there had been a seizure. 

Isn't that the issue?

 MR. JONES: That was the first holding. The 

second holding was that the Plaintiff had sufficiently 

claimed a cause of action on the seizure. And then it 

went back to the lower court to be considered under the 

Garner analysis. And what I liked about your decision 

-- excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Go ahead. Finish 

your --

MR. JONES: What I liked about your decision 

in that case, Justice Scalia, was that you said that the

officer's culpability for using excessive force is not 

diminished by the fact that perpetrator chose to 

continue running, whether it was the fleeing burglar in 

Garner or the fleeing driver in Brower. Excuse me, 

Mr. Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I could just get 

back to an earlier point. You think what the officer 

should have done in this case was to let Mr. Harris go.

 MR. JONES: That was one option. He could 

have continued the pursuit and simply decided not to mow 

him off the road at 90 miles an hour, or he could have 

stopped a pursuit and let him go which often happens in 

many pursuits.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though he 

doesn't know at that point that he will ever be able to 

arrest him later. He doesn't know if it's a stolen car 

or not.

 MR. JONES: That's correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And he doesn't know 

why he is being pursued, whether it's for mass murder or 

terrorism or anything else.

 MR. JONES: Well, that's correct. But in 

the majority of cases -- and this is the only testimony 

in this record, Your Honors. Our experts testified on a 

study -- based on a study which was commissioned for him

by the Department of Justice, a study which has been 

cited by some of the amicus briefs on both sides in this 

case, Dr. Albert testified that 70 percent of the time, 

when police back off pursuit, the perpetrator stops 

running and they resume safe driving. And when the car 

is stolen, most of the time --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Once they have 

gotten away, I assume.

 MR. JONES: Well, sometimes you have to let 

them get away. In Garner, it says, even if the guy has 

just broken into somebody's house in the middle of the 

night and committed a felony, if the choice is letting 

them go or using deadly force when the factors 

authorizing deadly force are not present, you have to 

let him go.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Not if he is shooting his 

way out of the house and endangering other people.

 MR. JONES: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, that's a factor 

here, of course. If he has taken the jewelry and he's 

gone off into the night, if shooting at him might 

endanger somebody else, or even kill him, you have to 

let him go. I'm talking about a burglar who is, you 

know, who is shooting as he leaves.

 MR. JONES: You can shoot him. I'd be there

shooting him, too.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course you can shoot 

him.

 MR. JONES: Let me take that distinction and 

apply it to the vehicle, Justice Scalia. What we have 

to have to authorize deadly force in this context is 

something more than just unsafe flight. You've got to 

have someone who is behaving violently, who is menacing 

people, trying to ram people.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell me as of the 

time he exited the parking lot, by that point, had he 

committed any felonies?

 MR. JONES: No. All he had done was taken 

evasive action to avoid an officer who --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: 90 miles an hour would not 

be a felony, not a reckless driving?

 MR. JONES: Are you talking about the 

traffic pursuit?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 MR. JONES: No, none of those are felonies 

under Georgia law.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: At no point did he commit 

a felony?

 MR. JONES: No, Your Honor. It's not even a 

felony in Georgia.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If he had intended to hit 

the police officer, was it --

MR. JONES: If he had intended to hit the 

police officer, if that was shown by the evidence, so 

they could have charged with aggravated assault. They 

didn't do that. They left traffic citations in his 

hospital room. They never arrested him. They never 

prosecuted him.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The key point is that he 

is endangering the lives and safety of others. Anyone 

who has watched that tape has got to come to that 

conclusion, looking at the road and the way that this 

car was swerving, and the cars coming in the opposite 

direction. This was a situation fraught with danger.

 MR. JONES: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I hope I 

don't have you on my jury if that's -- but what the 

trial court found was that construing the facts in a 

light most favorable to the Plaintiff as a nonmoving 

party, that reasonable jurors can find that this was 

simply a person who was driving fast. This was not a 

person who was driving assaultively. He wasn't driving 

violently. He wasn't a threat to anyone that would 

authorize the use of deadly force against him.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a factual finding 

of the, of the trial court here?

 MR. JONES: That is a factual finding.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are we bound by that fact?

 MR. JONES: We are bound by that. This is 

an interlocutory appeal, this an interlocutory appeal 

under Mitchell v. Forsythe, and the Court is bound by 

its own ruling to accept the facts as found by the court 

below, and decide the narrow issue of law here which is, 

one, is there a constitutional violation on these facts. 

And two, was the law clearly established.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Even if having watched the 

tape, there is no way that, that factual finding can be 

accurate?

 MR. JONES: If you want to repeal Johnson v. 

Jones and Mitchell v. Forsythe, then yes. This is the 

Supreme Court. You can make that determination.

 But based upon the prior rulings of this 

Court, this Court is bound to accept the findings of 

fact of the courts below, and then to determine solely 

the legal issue on an interlocutory basis. The bottom 

line issue here, Your Honors, is whether the fact that 

someone is driving in violation of traffic laws in and 

of itself can be justification for the use of deadly 

force.

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see how -- I mean, 

you know, given our prior discussion here, I don't see 

how that's the issue. Because you say we have to assume 

that the Defendant here didn't know that, in fact, all 

that was at issue was a violation of the traffic law.

 MR. JONES: Well, I'm not talking about the 

underlying violation here. I'm talking about the 

conduct observed by the officer who made the decision to 

use deadly force.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That conduct -- it could be 

conduct -- you could say exactly your same question, 

just as the Chief just said. I mean, I don't know how 

to get around this. You could say the question was, 

does a person who reasonably thinks he might be being 

pursued for a murder --

MR. JONES: This is the issue. This is the 

issue. If what this person is doing is driving, say 

driving unsafely, but they are not driving violently, 

they are not driving aggressively, they are not menacing 

anyone on the road. They are simply driving fast trying 

to get away, that in and of itself, is that going to be 

justification for the use of deadly force or is 

something more going to be required?

creating a grave danger, let's just assume that that's

the case, creating a very danger for other drivers on 

the road, when in your view is it reasonable for the 

police to use deadly force to stop that, as opposed to 

breaking off the chase? What, what is the test.

 MR. JONES: Well, under Garner the test is 

they have to be threatening violence or inflicting 

violence against someone. There have to be no other 

alternatives other than deadly force available to effect 

the apprehension. And assuming there is justification 

for deadly force, then there is a duty to give a warning 

where feasible before using deadly force. And the court 

below felt none of those three factors --

JUSTICE ALITO: How could you possibly give 

a warning in this situation?

 MR. JONES: It's academic in this case, 

because the first two factors were not met. I mean, 

it's our position that you don't worry about giving a 

warning unless you have the right to use deadly force, 

and if you don't get to that point then it's -- it's a 

moot question.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why wasn't there warning? 

There were lights, there were sirens. Surely the 

defendant knew that the police were trying to stop him.

 MR. JONES: There was certainly warning that 

he needed -- that he was expected to pull over. There

was no warning of any intent to use deadly force.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What am I -- you said 

factually. What am I supposed to assume? You said in 

light of -- I mean, I looked at the tape and that tape 

shows he is weaving on both sides of the lane, swerving 

around automobiles that are coming in the opposite 

direction with their lights on, goes through a red light 

where there are several cars that are right there, 

weaves around them, and there are cars coming the other 

way, weaves back, goes down the road.

 Now, what in fact -- am I supposed to 

pretend I haven't seen that? What am I supposed to 

pretend to here?

 MR. JONES: Well, I didn't see that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You didn't see that?

 MR. JONES: I --

JUSTICE BREYER: You didn't -- I thought 

that -- you didn't see that?

 MR. JONES: Well, the point is most people 

use the word weaving to describe the motion of 

Mr. Harris's car is when they are going through the, the 

shopping center --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I -- what I saw is 

he is driving down one lane, what I mean by weaving, and 

this lane goes with me in traffic. And there is some

cars in front of him, so he goes in the other lane where 

the cars are now coming right directly at him. And then 

before they hit him, he goes back to the first lane and 

he does this while going through a red light, it seemed 

to me.

 Am I -- did I mis-see that? I'll go look at 

it again if you --

MR. JONES: The -- feel free to look at it 

again.

killed, or injured, I assume that under the tort laws of 

most states, the police could be liable.

 MR. JONES: Well in theory perhaps they 

could be if the officer was a joint proximate cause of 

the accident, but in most states --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, aren't they the 

proximate cause if they continue the chase without 

trying to terminate it?

 MR. JONES: That's correct. If the officer 

terminates the chase then he is never going to be liable 

because number one he is acting prudently; he is going 

based upon Department of Justice studies showing 70 

percent --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. Well, I meant 

terminate the chase by -- by -- by forcing him off the 

road.

 MR. JONES: Well, if he terminates the chase 

using deadly force, that that creates a whole host of 

other problems.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But isn't there -- but 

isn't that one way to assure that the police are not 

liable, both from a moral standpoint and a legal 

standpoint, for causing the injury of other people?

standpoint the Fourth Amendment doesn't protect other

people. It protects those who have been seized. And 

that's, that's the framework we are dealing with here 

today.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you mean it's 

irrelevant to our analysis to consider that he might 

injure other people?

 MR. JONES: The potential for danger to 

others is certainly part of the justification for deadly 

force, just as, if deadly force cannot be used 

endangering other people, then that certainly goes into 

the matrix, too.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Jones, could I --

MR. JONES: Yeah.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I ask whether the 

portion of the opinion that you say establishes that he 

was not endangering anybody is this portion? The court 

is mindful that traffic laws are designed to -- safely 

-- and Harris acted in an unsafe manner. However, the 

record reflects" -- - is this the portion?

 MR. JONES: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- "that he maintained 

control over his vehicle." Well, that doesn't prove 

he's not endangering anybody. "Used his turn signals" 

-- wonderful.

JUSTICE SCALIA: "And did not endanger any 

particular motorist on the road." I think that's true. 

In that scary chase he, he didn't come close to hitting 

any particular car, but I don't think that's, that's a 

finding that he was not endangering anybody. "Any 

particular motorist," but he was endangering the public 

at large.

 MR. JONES: Well, this is my point is that 

if, if the drive --if the hazard caused by driving in 

and of itself is the only threat here, does that rise to 

a level of imminency and immediacy that justifies the 

use of deadly force? If it does, then any officer who 

perceives that someone is driving unsafely and that they 

may cause an accident to someone who may or may not be 

down the road if not stopped, would be justified in 

using deadly force, to literally take out anyone who is 

speeding.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on how fast --

if depends on how fast the car is going, whether it's a 

two-lane road or four-lane divided highway. All those 

factors come into, into account. And it doesn't seem to 

me that we have to adopt a rule that will, that will 

discourage police officers. There's, there's enough 

disincentive to engage in this kind of activity in the 

fact that the police officer may hurt himself. It's

pretty risky to conduct this kind of a maneuver, don't 

you think? I wouldn't have done it if I was Scott.

 MR. JONES: Well that's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I would have let the guy 

go.

 MR. JONES: Now what he, if he --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Driving 90 miles an hour 

and comes up, approaches that car, that car swerved. 

Scott could have been killed, couldn't he?

 MR. JONES: Absolutely. Or because he's 

also --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So I don't think we need a 

whole lot of disincentive to stop police officers in 

engaging in frolicsome conduct.

 MR. JONES: Well, not only that, Justice 

Scalia. The officer had no control over what was going 

to happen once he used deadly force, like the officer 

who fired into the cab of a flying vehicle in Barn v 

Cox, once you disable the driver the car keeps going. 

And in this case, when you -- when you hit the vehicle 

and knock a vehicle that has been in control and make it 

out of control, then it's now an unguided missile that 

could just as easily cross the center line and hit an 

innocent person.

question. In trying to assess the likelihood of harm to 

innocent people who would be hurt by this by this guy 

driving so fast, is that, do we measure it by assuming 

that the chase will continue? Or do we measure it by 

assuming that the chase would be discontinued?

 MR. JONES: The officer --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Just as we did in Garner?

 MR. JONES: The officer has both options. I 

mean Garner simply commands that he not use deadly force 

if it's a choice between letting him go and using deadly 

force. Now in the Sacramento v Lewis case, it does say 

that involves a different, a different type of claim and 

a different standard. But in the Sacramento case it 

does say that an officer in a pursuit has a duty to 

always be weighing the risk of the continued pursuit 

against the risk to the public. So there is an 

independent duty there to act reasonably.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: If it were -- clear that a 

jury could find that there would be no unreasonable risk 

to innocent motorists if they discontinued the chase --

assume that's a possible finding. If that were true, 

would there be a duty to discontinue the chase?

 MR. JONES: Not under the Fourth Amendment. 

Now, the -- the only expert testimony in this record on 

that subject says there is a 7 percent chance --

 MR. JONES: That's what Garner says, if you 

don't use deadly force. And that's what our claim is.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And aren't you 

concerned that that creates an incentive in every case 

for anyone who, that sees the blue lights behind them to 

know that all they have to do is keep fleeing and the 

police are going to have to give up eventually?

 MR. JONES: Well, let me respond by reading 

a portion of Garner that deals with that point, 

Mr. Chief Justice. These, these same important policy 

reasons were raised in Garner, that we don't want to 

encourage disobedience of issues. We want to discourage 

people from fleeing. And this is what the Garner Court 

said --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, Garner --

Garner was the case involving shooting the guy in the 

back, right?

 MR. JONES: Yes. He might easily break into 

someone else's house and perhaps end up killing them. 

This was a vigorous dissent in Garner. But this is what 

the majority said: "Without in any way disparaging the 

importance of these goals we are not convinced that the 

use of deadly force is a sufficiently productive means

of accomplishing them to justify the killing of 

nonviolent suspects."

 And if unsafe driving --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your, your answer to 

Justice Stevens as I understand it was the police not 

have the duty to discontinue the chase? The obverse of 

that is that the police may prolong the chase, i.e., 

prolong the injury to the public. I'm surprised at your 

answer.

 MR. JONES: Well, I think there is an 

independent duty, it doesn't rise under the Fourth 

Amendment, but there is an independent duty to do that. 

But my concern is that under Garner, given a choice 

between --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It is certainly the case 

that if there is going to be a, a risk of deadly harm to 

innocent third parties, there would be a duty to 

discontinue the chase rather kill him. But you don't 

seem to buy that.

 MR. JONES: Well, experience shows most of 

the time when you discontinue a chase, the person who is 

running discontinues driving unsafely. That is the --

that is experience. This officer's own policy says that

future fleeing speeders would do?

 I mean, I will accept that for, for the sake 

of argument that -- in fact, it's probably true. I 

would have guessed that, if the police stopped chasing, 

you don't go 90 miles an hour anymore. But did this 

study show what the effect of a rule that says stop 

chasing when he hits 85, what the effect of that rule 

would be on, on fleeing speeders or fleeing felons, or 

fleeing anybody?

 MR. JONES: Well, the rule simply says you 

don't kill him just because he is driving unsafely. And 

if, it simply says that if the choice is between killing 

him and letting him go, you have to let him go if the 

Garner factors aren't present. And we find nothing in 

the law and no reason to create a new exception in the 

law that says that Garner doesn't apply if you're 

fleeing by vehicle.

be affirmed.

Let me refocus for a moment that in order 

for the officer to be denied qualified immunity in this 

context a jury would have to be able to find two things. 

One, that no -- that there was no probable cause, and 

second, that that was clearly established. And I think 

that the discussion this morning if nothing else shows 

that it's not clearly established.

 As far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned, 

I think the measure needs to be exactly as this Court 

stated in Graham versus Connor, which is looking at the 

facts from the standpoint of the officer on the scene, 

because after all, he has to make split-second 

decisions. He does not have the benefit of taking 

depositions of Mr. Harris --

JUSTICE BREYER: What am I supposed to do? 

I mean, I'll look again at the tape. I certainly will 

do that. But suppose I look at the tape and I end up 

with Chico Marx's old question with respect to the Court 

of Appeals: Who do you believe, me or your own eyes?

 MR. SAVRIN: Your Honor, I think the answer 

to that question was provided in this decision in 

Ornelas versus United States, a decision by this Court 

in 1996 that came up in the context of a criminal, a 

direct criminal appeal involving the question of 

probable cause. And this Court set forth very clearly

that the historical facts are given deference. The 

question of, a legal question about whether those facts 

reasonably give rise to probable cause is an independent 

de novo review.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Whether he is endangering 

anybody is a historical fact, no? So what do you do 

about that finding?

 MR. SAVRIN: I don't believe that is 

historical fact.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is.

 MR. SAVRIN: The historical facts here are 

whether Mr. Harris was driving excessively, whether he 

was driving across the line, whether he was driving at 

high rates of speed, whether there was anybody in his 

path, whether he had collided with anyone. I think the 

question about whether or not those facts give rise to 

probable cause to believe that Harris was a threat of 

serious physical harm is a legal issue, and I think the 

Court of Appeals recognized that in this case when they 

applied a different analysis or came out with a 

different result to those same undisputed facts.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the, the court 

saying -- and this is on page 39 A of the petition 

appendix -- when Harris was driving away from officers 

and when there, when there were no other motorists or

pedestrians nearby, thus casting doubt on defendant's 

assertion that at the time of the ramming, Harris posed 

an immediate threat of harm to others.

 This is a finding that there were no other 

motorists or pedestrians nearby when the ramming 

occurred.

 MR. SAVRIN: And that is a fact that we 

accept as true in the immediate vicinity. The tape 

shows that there was a vehicle just 12 seconds before, 

and I think that a reasonable officer at the time would 

believe that that wasn't going to be the last vehicle on 

that road.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would hope he would wait 

until there were no pedestrians or vehicles coming 

before he, before he did the ramming.

 MR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume he waited 

precisely for that kind of a gap in the traffic?

 MR. SAVRIN: Yes, Your Honor. Exactly. He 

had limited options and I believe it was a no-win 

scenario. And he took the best course that he 

reasonably believed he could at the time. And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree with 

Mr. Jones' statement that none of Mr. Harris' conduct 

rose to the level of a felony?

MR. SAVRIN: I would not, Your Honor. In 

our brief we did list a number of felonies that 

Mr. Harris, that we believe he committed. But I would 

go back to Garner, and Garner says that an armed suspect 

would have been a different case. And Garner also says 

that some misdemeanors such as drunk driving are more 

dangerous that some felonies such as white collar crime. 

So I think the question should not be whether it's a 

technical issue of crossing the line from misdemeanor to 

felony, but the harm that is being caused by the 

continued driving that's exactly what occurred in this 

case.

 And if I could respond to Justice Breyer's 

question about what to do in terms of responding to 

Mr. Marx's question, I think the Ornelas case says that 

you would review it for clear error. And in this case 

you would not owe deference of a finding of fact by the 

lower court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Savrin. The case is submitted.

 [Whereupon, at 11:47 a.m., the case in the 

above-titled matter was submitted.]
