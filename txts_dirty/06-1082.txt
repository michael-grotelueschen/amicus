 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first today in 06-1082, Virginia v. Moore.

 Mr. McCullough.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. McCULLOUGH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. McCULLOUGH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 This Court has again and again held that an 

arrest is constitutionally reasonable if the officers 

have probable cause to believe a suspect has committed a 

crime. The Court has found that this standard 

represents the best compromise between the needs of the 

citizens and the duty of the government to combat crime. 

While the States are free to build additional procedures 

on this constitutional bedrock, when they do so these 

additional procedures are matters of State law. They do 

not change the constitutional standard.

 The Court below erred in substituting this 

clear, established, uniform, time-tested standard for a 

standard that has none of those virtues.

 First, it is undeniable that if State law 

can raise the constitutional bar, that it will lead to 

widespread differences on the exact same facts, on the

exact same crime, not only across State lines, but also 

within a particular jurisdiction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. McCullough --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If this officer had 

complied with the State law, that is he had issued a 

summons, then you agree that the exclusionary rule would 

apply if he went ahead and searched.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: That's correct. If he had 

issued a summons, Knowles would apply and the evidence 

would be excluded.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So would you explain the 

logic to saying that when the police violate State law, 

then the evidence can come in; but when they comply with 

State law, it can't.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: Your Honor, the rationale 

of Knowles was that the officer did not engage in any 

extended contact with the suspect and that there was no 

need to gather evidence.

 But where from a constitutional sense there 

is a full-fledged arrest, then the particular rationale 

of Knowles doesn't apply; and I don't think the -- we're 

asking the Court to embrace violations of State law; 

we're asking the Court to recognize that when a State 

goes above and beyond what the Constitution requires, 

that the remedies for those violations should be left to

the States.

 And Virginia has provided a number of those 

remedies; but here the officer did make a full custodial 

arrest.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Did you -- excuse me, 

sorry, General.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, you say he made a 

custodial arrest. Did he search the defendant at the 

time of the arrest?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: No. There was a 

miscommunication between the officers --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And did he search him at 

the place of the arrest?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: No.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, how can this be 

incident to an arrest?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: Your Honor, the fact of the 

arrest was uncontested, and the law doesn't require --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the search is 

unrelated to the arrest, as I understand the facts.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It took place later in a 

different place.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: Justice Stevens, the search 

was related to the arrest. What happened at the scene

was the officer made a pat-down and assumed the other 

officer had conducted the search. When they got to the 

hotel, they realized there had been a mix-up. But he 

had not yet been taken to the station and booked and so 

the rationale supporting the search incident to the 

arrest is present.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why is it present if 

he's not -- he searched when he wasn't arrested? I 

don't understand. Could they wait a week and do it?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: The arrest did not cease at 

that point, Your Honor. In United States v. Edwards, 

the Court recognized that at times the search will not 

proceed immediately upon arrest.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It's an ongoing arrest, is 

it?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: Well, it's an arrest --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Incident to an ongoing 

arrest? That's kind of a new concept.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: It's an arrest until he is 

released or denied bail. But I would also add that the 

timing issue was simply not raised below. And so 

there's no reason at this juncture to raise an issue 

that the litigants chose not to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McCullough, the 

proposition that you're arguing, does it apply at the

Federal level as well? Suppose -- suppose I think that 

my neighbor next door is growing marijuana and I have 

probable cause to believe that, all right?

 So I go in and search his house; and sure 

enough, there is marijuana. And I bring it to the 

police's attention, and they eventually arrest him.

 Is that lawful search?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: If there is State action --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm a State actor, I guess. 

You know --

(Laughter.)

 MR. McCULLOUGH: If you have State actors --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, a Supreme Court 

Justice should not be --

next door to somebody growing marijuana. It doesn't 

seem right.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: That's not a smart 

neighbor.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: If you have State action 

and you enter into someone's home, then the Constitution 

affords a heightened level of protection. But --

-- is it rendered an unreasonable search by the fact

 MR. McCULLOUGH: I don't think the fact 

of -- no. The fact that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So any Federal employee can 

go crashing around conducting searches and seizures?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: So long --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So long as he has probable 

cause?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fantastic.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: I think if there is State 

action, it doesn't matter that you're wearing a badge or 

that you've gone through the police academy.

administrative law judge at the, you know, Bureau of 

Customs? It doesn't matter?

marijuana, and he's just as offended as a Supreme Court 

Justice would be. Can he conduct a search?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: I think if he's doing it on 

behalf of the State, the answer is yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wow.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: But in terms of the 

Federal-State distinction, Your Honor, I think what 

we're advocating for is the uniform standard that this 

Court has embraced before, that there should not be a 

difference between a Federal officer on a State facility 

who is authorized under the Assimilated Crimes Act to 

arrest for Virginia laws and a Virginia officer who is a 

hundred feet away with making an unconstitutional arrest 

under the holding below when --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you agree that 

there was no probable cause to arrest, given the State 

statute?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: Your Honor --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're talking about 

probable cause to believe that he committed an offense.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: That's right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But was there probable 

cause to arrest?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: Well, the State court found 

there was no -- none of the exceptions in the statute

applied. But when the Court has used the term "probable 

cause to arrest," it has never required a two-step 

analysis of, first, probable cause to believe a crime 

had been committed, and then probable cause to arrest. 

It's always been, in this Court's cases, a single 

inquiry: Has there been probable cause?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could he -- could this 

officer have gotten a warrant to arrest Moore? Could he 

-- is it -- oh, there's an offense going on under 

Virginia law, I'm going to check with -- call in to see 

if I can get a warrant. Could he have gotten a warrant?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: Well, under the facts of 

this case he could have, but it would have caused a 

prolonged detention of the suspect.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could he -- how could 

he have gotten a warrant to arrest when it's 

a nonarrestable offense?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: Well --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: He couldn't -- would a 

judge have told this police officer -- they have a 

call-in procedure, call the judge. You want to -- you 

need to issue a warrant to arrest him for driving with a 

suspended license, but that's not an arrestable offense.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: Your Honor, it is an 

arrestable offense under certain circumstances. And so

the officer is left with each arrest to make a 

discretionary call.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did these officers think 

this -- those circumstances exist?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: The officers did not --

their only testimony was it was their prerogative. And 

unfortunately they did not then unpack that explanation 

to say why they thought one of the exceptions applied.

 What the State argued below and the State 

court rejected was that he was alone in a car with this 

large angry dog. There was no passenger that he could 

switch places with, and so if they write him a summons, 

logically, what is he going to do? He doesn't live 

anywhere nearby. As soon as they leave the scene, he's 

going to get right back in his car and drive away.

 Now the State court rejected that, but that 

illustrates the fact that under this statute the 

officers have to make discretionary calls as to when 

these exceptions apply. Is the defendant --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe we could say that in 

this, in these unique circumstances, where the officers 

could not let the fellow drive off without a license, it 

was not unreasonable to arrest him, but in some other 

situation where they had no arrest authority it would 

be.

MR. McCULLOUGH: Your --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you know, let's 

assume that the stop was not based on some, some 

deficiency in his license or some deficiency in the 

car -- I don't know what else it could be -- like, he 

had been going too fast, okay? And it's just a 

misdemeanor. He was five miles over the speed limit.

 Now, in that situation you couldn't say, as 

you've said here, gee, if they just let him go, he'd 

still be driving without a license; they had to arrest 

him; they had no choice. In that situation, he wouldn't 

necessarily be going above the speed limit. Would that 

be -- why couldn't you say it was reasonable here, but 

it wouldn't be reasonable there?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: Well, what we're asking the 

Court to do is to let the States regulate this arrest 

authority.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If that's the argument 

you're making, then don't bring forward the argument 

that they couldn't let him go because he'd be in 

violation of the law. If you want us to make that 

narrow a holding, I guess we can. Is that what you want 

us to do?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: All we're asking the Court 

to do is to affirm the probable cause standard that has

-- without any further balancing, that the balancing has 

occurred when --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, you're asking us to 

balance. You're asking us to say, after all, in this 

case if they hadn't arrested he would have been 

violating the law as soon as they let him go.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: No, I'm simply explain --

what I was trying to so was to explain that as a matter 

of state law these officers have to make these 

discretionary calls. If that then becomes the 

constitutional standard, that instead of a simple 

probable cause finding you have to get into every 

discretionary call by the officer, that it -- it 

turns actually --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You say this was not 

unlawful under Virginia law, then, because of the factor 

you brought forth?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: No, Your Honor. That was 

adversely litigated against us in the State court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't know what 

you're talking about a discretionary call. It wasn't a 

discretionary call. He couldn't arrest the person.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: Well -- but the problem is, 

if the standard then becomes a two-step probable cause, 

where we have to figure out as a matter of

constitutional law whether the officer guessed right in 

terms of one of these exceptions, then every 

discretionary judgment in the field becomes the occasion 

for constitutional --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But suppose it works 

the other way. If Virginia has a law saying you can 

arrest anybody you want on our highways, but, you know, 

here's what the offenses are, the officers did not have 

probable cause to think a crime had been committed, but 

it was they had probable cause to arrest, I suppose 

under the Respondent's theory that would be all right.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: It -- I mean, it certainly 

would flow from that. So I think, given the 

multitude --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask this question: 

You would argue it doesn't matter whether it violated 

State or Federal law; it's a question of Federal law on 

probable cause. But does the character of the crime for 

which the person is being arrested have any relevance to 

the question whether the search is reasonable? For 

example, supposing he is arrested for a tax offense; 

could you go ahead and search him incident to that 

arrest?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: The search incident to 

arrest is a bright-line rule, Your Honor, that this

Court has promulgated in Robinson.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: The answer is yes, they 

could search?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: I'm sorry. Yes, the answer 

is yes, that if a crime has been committed the 

bright-line rule permits the officer to search the 

suspect for officer safety as well as --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Even though the rationale 

for the search incident to arrest doesn't apply?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: What the -- yes, because 

what the Court said in Robinson was: We're not 

interested in delving into case-by-case litigation as to 

how dangerous this person was and how -- and whether 

there was a likelihood of evidence being found --

JUSTICE ALITO: Why would the rationale not 

apply in that situation? Are you accepting the 

proposition that anybody who's arrested for a tax 

offense is not a danger to the arresting officer? 

Haven't there been some pretty dangerous people arrested 

over the years for tax offenses?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. McCULLOUGH: I agree with that. I'm 

arguing that it's a bright-line rule and that if someone 

is arrested for a crime, tax or otherwise, it's not the 

nature of the crime --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're also 

arguing, as I understand it, that the -- that the 

search, even in the case of the tax arrest, does fall 

within the rationale of search incident to an arrest 

because one of those two rationales is officer safety. 

Isn't that your point?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So you reject the 

premise of the question then? The premise of the 

question was that the search incident to the arrest in 

the tax case is outside the rationale of searches 

incident to an arrest; and your position is it's not 

outside it.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: This Court has crafted a 

bright-line rule -- it has not distinguished between 

types of offenses; it doesn't have to be a violent 

offense; it could be a white-collar offense -- that 

across the board there is virtue to having this 

bright-line rule that permits the officer to search 

incident to a lawful arrest. And in Robinson the Court 

noted that a lawful arrest is a -- that it met a 

constitutionally lawful arrest, one made with probable 

cause. This arrest was made with probable cause. The

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The States and the Federal Government may 

for a variety of reasons enact restrictions on officer 

authority that exceed the requirements of the Fourth 

Amendment as this Court has articulated them.

 When such State law or Federal law 

extra-constitutional restrictions are violated, it is a 

matter for the government that enacted them to determine 

what remedy appropriately flows from that violation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does the person making the 

arrest at least have to have some arrest authority?

arresting people or searching people.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, certainly, 

Justice Scalia, such an individual wouldn't have 

positive law authority to engage in an arrest.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just as this person here 

didn't have positive law authority to engage in an 

arrest.

 MR. DREEBEN: The question would then be 

whether that means that it's automatically a 

constitutional violation. I think in some situations 

even a governmental official can act in a private 

capacity by acting outside the boundaries of that 

individual's responsibility.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but he was purporting 

to act in an official capacity. And he did, indeed, 

give the marijuana to the officials at the Justice 

Department.

 MR. DREEBEN: And if you assume that the 

Court would have two options. It could either 

federalize some sort of an amorphous requirement that 

there must be law enforcement authority in an official 

in order for that official to engage in Fourth Amendment 

activity, or it could hold that, what I think is the 

more reasonable approach, which is that the bedrock 

requirements of the Fourth Amendment protect against

arbitrariness, and the crucial one here is the existence 

of probable cause based on the facts to believe that the 

individual has violated a law.

 If that criteria is met, it is not 

constitutionally unreasonable, absent where an 

extraordinary intrusion for the individual's liberty or 

privacy interests to be compromised. It may be the most 

flagrant violation of departmental regulations in the 

world, and in that case the department that has those 

regulations can take action, just as here Virginia says 

if you violate the arrestable offense rule under 

Virginia law, the consequence is not to exclude 

evidence. Virginia will not exclude evidence under its 

own State law for a violation of this provision.

 But it does say under State law that a 

person can resist an unlawful arrest, The officer can be 

sued for engaging in an unlawful arrest under State law, 

and that the officer can be fired or disciplined. And 

those are the sanctions that the State has chosen to do.

 Now, what the Virginia Supreme Court has 

done is come along and say, even though you do not 

intend this rule to trigger the exclusionary rule under 

Virginia law, you have no choice. As a matter of 

Federal constitutional law, if Virginia decides to 

exceed the constitutional minimum as this Court

announced in Atwater and place additional restrictions 

on the arrest authority, it must pay a constitutional 

price of having the evidence excluded if that rule is 

violated.

 At the outset, it's clear that imposing such 

a Fourth Amendment rule would do nothing other than 

discourage the States from providing additional 

restrictions as a matter of their own State's law that 

may serve to protect citizen privacy interests above the 

floor that this Court has identified as required by the 

Fourth Amendment.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you're right, 

Mr. Dreeben, then the Court gave a false signal when it 

GVR'd in Lovelace, in the Lovelace case, the person who 

was drinking in public, it GVR'd in light of Knowles.

 MR. DREEBEN: I don't know that it gave a 

false signal, Justice Ginsburg, but a GVR doesn't 

indicate this Court's disposition of the merits once all 

of the arguments are presented to it. And, admittedly, 

I think neither side is able to point to a case that 

squarely addressed and conclusively resolved the issue 

that's before this Court.

 What the Court has done, I think, under 

related issues under Fourth Amendment law is announce 

pretty clearly that the fact that a State has either

renounced an interest in taking a particular law 

enforcement action that it could otherwise 

constitutionally take or positively prohibited a law 

enforcement action does not mean that the action is 

unconstitutional.

 As long ago as the Cooper v. California 

case, the Court dealt with the situation where an 

officer was not authorized to undertake an inventory 

search, and the California courts treat it as a 

violation of their own law.

 This Court said it was still a reasonable 

search under the Fourth Amendment; and unless 

Respondent -- excuse me, unless -- well, Respondent 

concludes that there should be a different Fourth 

Amendment rule for searches than procedures, Cooper 

stands for the proposition that a violation of State law 

does not ipso facto equate to a violation of the Federal 

Constitution.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we rule for Respondent 

in this case, would we have to reexamine the holding in 

California v. Greenwood?

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Kennedy. 

California v. Greenwood is the next case in the line 

where the Court recognized that California had made it 

illegal to conduct garbage searches. And you could make

the same argument that Respondent is making here today: 

That California had renounced any interest in conducting 

garbage searches, therefore there's nothing on the State 

side of the line to balance against the individual's 

invasion of privacy, and therefore the State should 

lose. And this Court held precisely the opposite in 

California v. Greenwood, finding that it was 

constitutionally reasonable to engage in the garbage 

search because there was no federally recognized 

expectation of privacy, even though the State had 

decided to go further and grant an additional layer of 

protection to its citizens.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There could not have been 

a warrant -- a grant-- a judge could not have given a 

warrant for arrest on these charges.

 MR. DREEBEN: I'm venturing a little bit 

outside of my expertise under State law, but I think 

that that's correct. Because State law provided that 

this was not an arrestable offense unless one of the 

exceptions to the offense existed.

 And I should note that one of the offenses 

here -- excuse me -- one of the exceptions here is that 

a court of general jurisdiction could have entered an 

exemption from the arrestable offense rule and then 

officers within that jurisdiction would have been

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How often and under what 

circumstances is that Virginia -- Virginia law rule? I 

mean, when does a general district court give permission 

for a custodial arrest in a certain class of cases?

 MR. DREEBEN: I know that it has done it. I 

don't know that there are any restrictions on when it 

would do it. The point, I think, of giving the general 

courts the authority to do this is that these kinds of 

laws are not necessarily enacted, as Respondent posits, 

to be supplementary protection for privacy. They do not 

necessarily represent a judgment that law enforcement 

officers should never bring people in for minor traffic 

misdemeanors. They may represent a judgment that law 

enforcement officers should be out on the beat policing 

more important crimes and it's a waste of social 

resources and scarce police resources to have them 

bringing people downtown for these kinds of offenses.

 In a particular jurisdiction, law 

enforcement may make a case that actually it's important 

enough to deter various traffic violations and to ensure 

that the individuals show up, that officers should have 

plenary authority to make arrests.

the time before arraignment in the context of 

confessions, the McNabb-Mallory rule?

 MR. DREEBEN: The McNabb-Mallory rule --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Which is Federal.

 MR. DREEBEN: -- is uniquely Federal. The 

closest analog -- and this may be what Your Honor has in 

mind -- is that in the County of Riverside case the 

Court set a 48-hour outside limit for when you have to 

bring an arrested individual before a magistrate for a 

probable cause hearing. Under Respondent's position --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, was there any 

indication in that case that if the State had a shorter 

period, they would --

MR. DREEBEN: No, and that's precisely, I 

think, the point. All of the rules that this Court has 

announced under the Fourth Amendment, the search 

incident to arrest rule, which is triggered as a 

bright-line rule without regard to whether the specifics 

of the case support it, under Respondent's theory 

Virginia could overrule that by saying officers shall 

not conduct a search incident to arrest without a 

specific exigency in that case. States could overrule 

within their own jurisdictions the Federal rule that 

this Court announced in Riverside. It could say that 

individuals have to be brought before a magistrate

within 12 hours or they have to be released. And under 

Respondent's theory that you absorb State law into the 

reasonableness inquiry, this Court's Federal court 

decision would be overruled. And most directly here, 

Atwater would be overruled with respect to 

non-arrestable offenses if Respondent's position is 

correct that when the State has said that we don't want 

to undertake an arrest for a minor offense, therefore, 

there's no longer any State interest in undertaking the 

arrest.

 The reality is that this Court has balanced 

as a matter of Fourth Amendment law what is 

constitutionally necessary as a uniform Federal matter 

to protect people against arbitrary law enforcement 

action, and it's drawn the line at probable cause. And 

as this Court said in Whren, absent rare circumstances 

when probable cause exists, a search or seizure is 

reasonable.

 And the kind of rare circumstances that the 

Court gave the example of in Whren were heightened 

intrusions on individual privacy or liberties such as 

surgery to remove evidence or an unannounced entry into 

a home. We don't have anything like that here and the 

standard Federal rule should govern.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The notion that the proud men who framed the 

Constitution would believe it reasonable to go out and 

arrest someone for a non-arrestable offense and not only 

do that, but having committed that trespass at common 

law, to further search them, is I think an extreme 

proposition and one that they would not have accepted.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you think they would 

accept arresting somebody for not wearing a seat belt?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Your Honor, I do --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me we've 

crossed that bridge with Atwater.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Your Honor, I disagree, 

for the reason that -- and there are obviously -- I'm 

not here to tell the Court what its own precedents mean. 

But Atwater makes quite clear that at common law this 

was something that was subject to legislate ive 

override, and that's what was reasonable at common law 

when the Constitution was framed. And that is, 

legislatures sometimes said that you could arrest and

sometimes said that you couldn't.

 But two things were undisputable, I think, 

and that is when you did arrest illegally that was 

unreasonable --

JUSTICE BREYER: The particular illegal 

arrest here, to bring this down to earth a little bit, 

is I take it they arrested him because he had a 

suspended -- he was driving without a good license?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So that Virginia law 

says if you stop somebody, arrest him -- if you stop 

somebody, you know he doesn't have a license to drive, 

you can arrest him if you think he's going to continue 

driving? Can't you?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So the policemen 

here, according to you and I guess the Virginia court, 

made a misjudgment. He thought this guy might still 

drive somewhere or he might have thought it or a 

policeman in similar circumstances might have thought 

it.

 So Virginia says if, in fact, policemen, you 

stop somebody for suspended -- for driving without a 

license, and you make a mistake, you arrest him, we 

don't think that's a big deal, because who knows if he's

going to continue to drive. We don't even suspend. We 

don't even suspend. We don't even suppress the 

evidence. That's Virginia.

 So if Virginia isn't going to suppress the 

evidence because they think it's not a big deal to make, 

for the policeman to make a mistake as to whether a 

person who's driving without a license will keep driving 

once the policeman goes away, why do you think Thomas 

Jefferson and everybody else thought that that was such 

a big deal that the evidence had to be suppressed?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: For a few reasons. First, 

Virginia does take this quite seriously. The officer 

can be fired for violating the statute. That's no small 

thing.

 The second is I wouldn't assume that 

Virginia believes and the Virginia legislature believed 

that the evidence would not be suppressed, because for 

reasons that I'll explain in a minute the Virginia 

legislature was triggering a long line of its court 

cases that say if you arrest someone for a 

non-arrestable offense, the Fourth Amendment is 

violated, and the application of the exclusionary rule 

has never been questioned in that context.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought it's 

questioned in your footnote 13 in your brief. You seem

to suggest that the exclusionary rule is not at issue in 

this case.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. I don't 

question its application, but neither does Virginia, 

Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So - so we should 

write an opinion saying we're not saying that it was 

correct to -- we're not saying that it was correct to 

exclude the evidence in this case?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's -- I think that 

that's right. That also happened in California v. 

Greenwood, you may recall, Mr. Chief Justice, where 

there was some discussion at oral argument about would 

we believe the exclusionary rule should be applied here. 

That question had not been preserved. That case is on 

remand in the California Supreme Court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What is the difference 

between this and Whren? That is, in Whren the arrest 

violated a D.C. regulation that says a plainclothes 

officer cannot approach a car except in immediate cases 

of immediate danger. And in Whren we said that isn't 

such a big deal and we don't think the Fourth Amendment 

turns on that kind of triviality.

 All right. If it doesn't turn on that kind 

of arrest procedure triviality, is how we characterized

it there, how is this any any different?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Whren is different in 

several different ways. The first is that that was a 

challenge to the stop, not the search incident to 

arrest. The claim was that the officers under a local 

D.C. Government regulation did not have the power to 

make a traffic stop because there was a local regulation 

that said if you're not in uniform and if you're not in 

a police car, a marked car, you shouldn't make those 

traffic stops.

 So, it's different on a couple of different 

actions. The nature of the constitutional challenge, 

the nature of the law that's being evoked, the local 

regulation rather than legislation, I think, are the 

principal ones.

 Here we're dealing with something quite 

fundamental, and I haven't gotten to this 

Court's precedents applying the common law rule that I 

described at the beginning, so if I could do and then 

compare Whren. Post -- define the common law, every 

since Weeks, which is the first case of this Court to 

recognize the search incident arrest exception, all the 

way through Di Re, Miller, Johnson, Ker, DeFillippo, 

those are five cases that confront the question in this 

case, I believe that genuinely confront it; is not

dictum, it is holding.

 Those cases confront the question: Can you 

have a constitutional search incident to an illegal 

arrest? Illegal there not being unconstitutional, but a 

violation of State law.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why do you draw a 

distinction between something that's prohibited by a 

statute, something that's prohibited by a local ordnance 

or let's say it's a directive of the police department? 

And if it's -- if the arrest is contrary to any of those 

things, it's unlawful under State law, is it not?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The court hasn't ever 

confronted that question. The places -- the line of 

cases that I described were one of two things, Positive 

State legislation enacted by the legislature or common 

law. It has never dealt with the locality question. 

Whren suggests that maybe a local police regulation is 

too variable. We would win under either rule.

 The -- I think the core reason you would 

draw the line at legislation is because this -- the 

Fourth Amendment is not just an instrumental thing 

designed to do good. It is, as designed, to apply 

common law concepts of reasonableness, which was the 

foundation --

argument that if the arrest is unlawful under State law 

it's an unreasonable search, an unreasonable arrest 

under the Fourth Amendment?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. And your 

question, Justice Alito, is designed to test what I mean 

by unlawful in terms of what sources -- the State 

constitution, legislation, local police practices.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No. It's designed to test 

whether you really mean unlawful under State law. 

Either you don't mean it, because something that 

violates a municipal ordnance is unlawful under State 

law, and yet you would not apply your test. So you 

could express your test differently, unlawful under 

State statutory law.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: If I have conveyed that 

impression, I am sorry. I did not intend to. Our rule 

is that if it's unlawful. All I'm saying is the Court 

could conclude that local police regulations, for 

example, are too variable to -- and Whren calls them 

"trivialities," so we won't pick them up.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it says the laws 

of the 50 States are pretty variable on this question as 

well.

it's a crime at all, as are under Indianapolis v. Edmund

and lots of other cases where the court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do we have to look 

at both of those varieties? Let's say the State has a 

rule that, yes, you can arrest people in a way that we 

would say you can't, but you don't have to have probable 

cause. You just have to -- they're just arrestable.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, as Justice Ginsburg 

suggests, you have to have probable cases to arrest. 

Cases like Berkemer, Seth --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- is probable cause 

to arrest. The State has a law that says you can arrest 

in these circumstances whether or not you have probable 

cause to believe that a crime has been committed.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry. By that phrase I 

mean there is a constitutional component. Part of the 

constitutional floor is that you have to have sufficient 

cause. That's a guarantee of the Fourth Amendment. 

This Court's cases make clear you can't go below --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you were 

telling us it has to be sufficient cause to arrest, not 

sufficient cause to believe that a crime has been 

committed.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is necessary but not a 

sufficient condition, Mr. Chief Justice. There's

element of the -- the degree of proof that's required by 

this Court precedents.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it is, as your 

friends on the other side put it, you are advocating a 

two-step process. There has to be probable cause to 

arrest and there has to be probable cause to believe a 

crime has been committed?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I view those as the same 

thing. We may be just having --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, they're 

different here. They had probable cause to believe a 

crime has been committed, but you say they didn't have 

probable cause to arrest because State law makes it 

illegal.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: In that sense, absolutely. 

I just wanted to make sure I understood the terminology. 

That's correct.

 But let me make quite clear that we are 

discussing in the first half hour and the second half 

hour I think two slightly different things. The first 

half hour focused on the constitutionality of the arrest 

vel non, which is at issue in Atwater, for example, and 

at issue -- not even in Whren, which is just a traffic 

stop.

 I am focusing on the somewhat different

point. There is a line of cases that deals with the 

constitutionality of the search incident to arrest and 

it says because at common law you could not search 

someone pursuant to an arrest that was a trespass, the 

search itself is unconstitutional. So if at the time of 

the framing a Federal officer, a Federal marshal, at the 

time of the framing had the power to arrest them for 

State law offenses, as they still do under the OLC 

opinions.

 If a Federal marshal had gone up to someone 

who's committing a completely trivial offense, Atwater 

recognizes there are offenses at common law that are not 

arrestable. That would be a trespass and to search the 

person incident to that arrest would have violated the 

Fourth Amendment, we believe. It would have been 

unreasonable. When Mapp applies the Fourth Amendment to 

the States, it would have been --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the State 

makes a trivial offense arrestable, as in Atwater? 

You're suggesting in that situation the common law rule 

we have doesn't apply. It's a trivial offense, but it's 

made arrestable and therefore it doesn't violate the 

Fourth Amendment to search incident to that arrest.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. At common law 

and under the Fourth Amendment, that's right. You look

to the positive source of authority, which is State law 

authority to arrest or a common law authority to arrest. 

That would not be unconstitutional. That -- that rule 

also make sense as a question of the structure of our 

democracy. Remember, it puts in the hands of the 

legislature, which can be held responsible for the 

decision to make a trivial offense --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if 

the legislature -- this was the hypothetical Mr. Dreeben 

posed. What if the legislature says yes, you can arrest 

for this offense but you cannot search incident to the 

arrest, because we think that's too much of an intrusion 

given the fact that it's a relatively trivial offense? 

In that case, would our doctrine saying under the Fourth 

Amendment you can search incident to a valid arrest be 

reversed preempted, preempted by the State law?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No. There are times --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the State can 

define the circumstances under which you can have an 

arrest, but the State can't define and limit the 

consequences of the arrest?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. That is --

there are traditions that are rooted in the common law, 

that the search incident to arrest here was pursuant to 

a trespass at common law that was completely

rejected the, in effect, the trespass rationale; and 

what you're telling us now, it seems to me, based on in 

effect trespass concepts, is that so far as the Fourth 

Amendment is concerned an arrest may constitutionally be 

made, but the officer following that arrest may not take 

the step of determining whether the individual arrested 

has on his person anything that can be used to hurt the 

officer like a knife or a gun?

 And why should be we draw what seems to 

me -- if we scrap, as we have done, the trespass 

analogy, why should we make what seems to me at least an 

irrational distinction of saying the Fourth Amendment 

says it's okay to arrest but it's not okay to protect 

yourself after you have arrested? Why should we accept 

such a rule?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: This is I think the hardest 

question for us, and so if I could have the time to give 

you a couple of answers. The first is remember your 

instrumental point is that the officer has the person, 

they need to protect themselves. We know that is not 

itself -- and I'm going to give you a couple of 

answers -- that is not itself to make the search

constitutional because everyone agrees that if the 

arrest was unconstitutional, then the search, 

notwithstanding the exigencies that exist under Chimel 

and like cases all the way back, exist. So it's not 

enough that the officer has to protect himself. The 

reason --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. But we're starting 

with a different premise.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We're starting with a 

constitutional premise.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. I understand this. 

Justice Souter, I understand. I was just trying to get 

to your -- what I think is the greatest sort of logical 

force: The officer need to protect himself.

 Now, to get to the harder case, which is 

yours, and that is accept that the arrest is 

constitutional. We of course don't do that. We believe 

that there isn't a sufficient interest to make it 

reasonable, but you posit otherwise. The reason is 

given by Justice Powell's concurrence in Robinson, which 

is the fundamental search and seizure arrest case, and 

he says when the person is lawfully arrested they have 

engaged in conduct that they know can subject them to 

arrest, they have a reduced expectation of privacy. So

while it's the case that the governmental interest 

remains the same -- protect the officer, find the 

evidence -- the other side of the Fourth Amendment 

balance is fundamentally different, because when a 

person has engaged in conduct which they know does not 

subject them to arrest they do not have a reduced 

expectation of privacy.

 This individual had every reason to believe 

dating back to the traditions of common law, to positive 

State law, that they would not be searched incident to 

arrest.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If that -- if that logic is 

sound and that logic depends on Justice Powell's use of 

the word unlawfully, then it seems to me the -- the only 

way to arrest an irrational system would to be conclude 

that, in fact, the arrest is not constitutionally 

lawful. Because on -- on your logic, you're still left 

with the problem that I raised; and a constitutional 

arrest in which the officer does not violate the Fourth 

Amendment by apprehending the person, and yet the 

officer is disabled from protecting himself, if we're 

going to have a sensible rule, we've either got to say 

the Fourth Amendment allows him to make the search 

incident and protect himself, or we've got to have a 

rule that says the Fourth Amendment doesn't allow him to

make the search -- make the arrest in the first place. 

Otherwise we've got a crazy system.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Can I just correct one 

thing? And that is it does not depend on Justice 

Powell's use of the word unlawful. I believe to rule 

against us, Justice Souter, that you will have to 

overrule the line of cases from Di Re to DeFillipo. 

Those are on point. Now you may decide --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Don't you think we have 

to, if not overrule, at least back away from the holding 

in California versus Greenwood?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, Justice Kennedy, and 

that's why I focused so much on searches incident to 

arrest. There are times when State law is incorporated 

into the Fourth Amendment, and everybody agrees that 

regulatory searches are; inventory searches are, there 

are times when it isn't. And California v Greenwood is 

not one and there's a logical reason for it. And that 

is that the premise of when you were deciding in a -- in 

a trash search, this Court's document looked at two 

things. The first is, is there a reasonable expectation 

of privacy, and if there is do we balance the interest? 

California v Greenwood says there was no reasonable 

expectation of privacy because that's evaluated as a 

societal matter. I'm focusing on a very narrow question

that doesn't disturb any other doctrines.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about Cooper -- Cooper 

v California?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I think Cooper v California 

is a very good case for us, because Cooper and all its 

progeny say that State law has to authorize and 

determine the validity of the inventory search. If you 

violate the State regulations on when you conduct an 

inventory search, you violated the Fourth Amendment.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can we go back for a 

second? Because, the reason I asked my question is I 

was thinking about this very differently, and I just 

want to have an answer, and I want your best thinking on 

this. My thought is that the answer to the question of 

whether it violates the Fourth Amendment when a State --

when a person is arrested in violation of State law, the 

answer is: it depends. Sometimes yes, sometimes no. 

Obviously, if there is no probable cause or if there 

wasn't a crime at all, as just defined, the answer is 

yes; but then I look at Whren and it says if all that 

was at stake was a kind of arrest procedure State law, 

herein -- there embodied in a rule, the answer is no. 

So I look at this one. And this one it seems to me 

there is probable cause; it is a crime; moreover, it is 

a crime for which the State permits arrest where the

officer subjectively thinks he's likely to keep driving. 

So it seems to me that's maybe much more close to what 

we had in Whren.

 Now I want you to say -- I want your 

comments on what I -- it's hypothetical, my statement, 

because I want to get your reaction to that point of 

view. I'm not saying I hold it. But I'm putting it 

forward so that I can get your reaction and argument.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, I think it is a 

terribly difficult rule to administer when you try to 

decide, well if this is a law that sometimes allows 

arrest and sometimes does not. It is an infinitely more 

administrable rule on our side, where we say to the 

police officers, you have the power to arrest or not and 

that's what determines --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think it is much easier 

to administer, to have a uniform Federal standard, 

rather than whether or not an officer can arrest in one 

county for something and not in another county whether 

he has to have a badge or not. Those are the kind of 

trivialities we talked about in Whren.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Kennedy, 

remember, we have one standard for an officer on the 

street, and that is, look -- do, if you're allowed to 

arrest, you can arrest, and that's what will determine

the constitutionality of the search incident to arrest. 

The Government posits two different standards that 

govern the officer's conduct: a Federal one and State 

one.

 But let me also get to your point, Justice 

Kennedy, that you are worried that are all kinds of 

these State laws. There's -- you know, are you out of 

your jurisdiction , are you wearing a uniform? What we 

think that the common law was concerned with, and this 

line -- this Court's court line of cases from Di Re to 

DeFillipo is a more fundamental judgment. It's like the 

judgment whether it's a crime at all. The police power 

of the State is most fundamentally, is this a crime, can 

we arrest for it, someone for it, so that we will hold 

them? And those are the judgments: is its arrestable 

or not? And not these other little things that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But under that analysis, 

it seems to you we rely on the citizen's expectation of 

privacy as the justification. And I think 

Justice Kennedy makes a rather strong response to that, 

because it's unrealistic to assume that a citizen in 

certain counties in Virginia had such an expectation but 

did not in other counties, because most citizens don't 

know the sophisticated aspects of the Virginia law.

court note, there's no other State that has one of these 

statutes. Just in terms of your thinking about whether 

this is a common practice, we haven't been able to find 

any others, and even in Virginia, it's only to a small 

body of offenses. But even taking as a given --

Justice Stevens, I think doctrinally, as Justice Powell 

says in Robinson, the notion is that people go out into 

the world and engage in conduct, and we expect them to 

know the law. Sometimes that's an unreasonable 

expectation, but it's the only premise that this Court 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, can I get 

back to your discussion of Cooper? In Cooper, you said 

that if it violates the State law for an inventory 

search, then you can't search incident to that. But 

that's because it is then not an inventory search. Here 

there's no doubt that this was an arrest, whether it 

complied with State law or not.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Chief Justice Roberts, I do 

disagree. Post-Cooper, in South Dakota v. Opperman, 

even if the police officers label it an inventory search 

-- the person says, oh, we were just trying to keep 

track of everything, so nobody doubts they were really 

inventorying things -- the Court has said it's the --

the practice is, the State practice is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but just -- it 

gets to -- I mean, if you don't follow the State rules, 

it doesn't comply with the rules for an inventory 

search. But here you're saying if don't -- you're not 

saying if you don't follow the State rules, it's not an 

arrest. It's not a lawful arrest. But that's a 

different question than whether or not it is an arrest. 

Our precedents say if it's an arrest, you can search 

incident to the arrest.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, I 

disagree. This Court has said many times, and indeed 

squarely held in Johnson, where the evidence was 

suppressed, that it has to be an arrest that is lawful 

under State law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Goldstein, can I bring 

you back to Cooper v. California?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which you say is a good 

case for you. I don't see how you can say that. This 

was a case of a car impounded. The State court had said 

that there was no authority to search the car, simply 

because it was impounded, and we said the question here 

is not whether the search was authorized by State law; 

the question is rather whether the search was a 

reasonable one under the Fourth Amendment.

Just as a search authorized by State law may 

be an unreasonable one under that amendment, so may a 

search not expressly authorized by State law be 

justified as a constitutional reasonable one. And you 

think that helps your case?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Not -- I don't think that 

language is relevant for the following reason: What the 

Court said in Cooper was that the seizure of the car, 

which is analogous to the arrest here, right? They 

seized my client's person; they seized the car. The 

Court said because the seizure of the car was lawful 

under State law, then the search incident to was. And 

let me just read to you from Coolidge versus --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Even though the State law 

did not authorize it.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The State law did not speak 

to it either way, but -- it didn't speak to it either 

way.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They were assume ing, in 

that passage, that the State law did not authorize it, 

or otherwise the passage makes no sense.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, I disagree. 

In any event, post-Cooper, South Dakota v. Opperman, as 

the conversation between the Chief Justice and I was 

just explaining, is perfectly clear that the inventory

search has to be authorized pursuant to State 

regulation. If after Cooper this is perfectly settled, 

there really isn't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, if we 

assume, contrary to your footnote 13, that the 

exclusionary rule is implicated in this case, could you 

explain why, under the Federal Constitution, there 

should be imposed on the State an exclusionary rule for 

a violation of State law when State law does not impose 

an exclusionary rule for the violation of its law?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Assuming the Court decides 

that the question was not waived because it wasn't 

briefed, the reason is that this Court's exclusionary 

rule precedents look to something else, and that is: 

Did the evidence follow directly from the 

unconstitutional conduct? And here it did.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess the 

question would be: Why doesn't our jurisprudence on 

whether there's an arrest also look to something else, 

rather than whether it's permitted or violated under 

State law? In other words, the State doesn't -- the 

State law does not provide for the exclusionary rule, 

but we say the Fourth Amendment does.

State law, but your brothers say under the Fourth

Amendment it is because there's probable cause to 

believe a crime has been committed.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, I think 

that illustrates the point I am willing to accept, and 

that is there are times that State law is relevant under 

this Court's doctrines; there are times it isn't. Welsh 

v. Wisconsin, for example, is another example where the 

Court looks squarely to the State law of whether and how 

serious the offense is. My point is that there is a 

very particular doctrine that is in play here that deals 

with searches incident to arrest.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if Virginia has a 

statute that said it's unlawful to arrest for a traffic 

violation, but that it is lawful under Virginia law for 

an officer to conduct a search incident to any arrest, 

whether it's lawful under Virginia law or not? Would we 

follow that latter Virginia law?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't know. That is the 

true answer, because no State has such a law. It would 

depend, I think, on whether the arrest itself satisfied 

constitutional --

JUSTICE ALITO: What is the difference 

between that law and in effect what Virginia has in 

place? They say the arrest is unlawful, but they don't 

provide for the exclusion of evidence that's obtained as

a result of that arrest under Virginia law.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The reason is I think the 

one -- that the Court has never looked to the State law 

remedies in Di Re, Miller, Johnson, Ker, and DeFillippo, 

and that it looks to what the common law would look to, 

which is: Is the arrest legal or not?

 I also would repeat what I said to Justice 

Breyer, and that is I would not assume that Virginia 

believes that the exclusionary rule wouldn't apply 

because those precedents trigger the Fourth Amendment.

 But, Justice Breyer, I do want to come back 

to your question about, okay, Whren. The important 

differences are: Remember Whren didn't just say that 

things about whether people can be arrested are 

trivialities. It's at the core of the Fourth Amendment. 

The Court would never say that arrest is a triviality. 

What it's talking about is what concerned 

Justice Kennedy, and that is the kind of rule in Whren, 

which is the guy had to be in a police uniform and 

driving around in a marked police cruiser, which could 

vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the Court felt 

that was more of a triviality. This is a much more 

fundamental statement --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And both arrests are 

illegal, but you're saying that there's a difference.

So your bright-line rule now seems to evaporate.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, I don't --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean I'm assuming that 

your answer to my question about the badge or the wrong 

county and so forth would not result in suppression. 

Correct me if I have misinterpreted your argument.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: We have proposed two 

alternative rules. Fundamentally, that's right. And 

that is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's right?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry. You're right: 

On our core condition, the evidence would not be 

suppressed. The reason is that we think the most 

fundamental State judgment here is whether this offense 

is arrestable. Alternatively, the Court could apply a 

rule that just says State officers, if they're allowed 

to arrest lawfully, then that will generate a 

constitutional search incident to arrest. We would win 

under either either rule.

 I think the core of our case is a much 

simpler rule that simply says if the State has decided 

this thing is not arrestable, it obviously doesn't have 

an interest in the arrest that would outweigh the 

individual's expectation of privacy -- remember search 

incident to arrest is an exigency. There is no --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then if you -- do you 

accept the proposition then, in some of these minor 

cases, the arrest might be valid, then you're whole 

argument about the Framers and the trespass and so forth 

is wrong.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: To -- that's correct. If we 

are going to follow the common law and the rule that is 

articulated, I think, in every single 

search-incident-to-arrest case, that it has to be a 

lawful arrest, that's right. It will take up all of 

State arrest law. I'm not trying to hide from that 

fact. But the Court has never had a problem with that. 

In all of those cases all through time, it has never had 

any problem with administerability or anything else with 

a rule that simply says to the police officer: If 

you're allowed to arrest him, arrest him; if you're not, 

you're not, and you can't search him constitutionally. 

That is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think your friend 

agreed that the cases didn't establish whether our 

references to probable cause meant to probable cause to 

arrest or probable cause to believe that a crime had 

been committed. You don't agree with that? Do you 

think that the cases foreclose their position?

search-incident-to-arrest cases. I think two things. 

This is my understanding of the Court's precedents. The 

Court has said if you have probable cause, you can 

arrest. In every case that it has said that, it has 

been lawful at State law to arrest -- to arrest. So the 

Court has confronted this question when it comes to the 

constitutionality of the arrest vel non.

 There is a second line of cases that deals 

specifically with this search-incident-to-arrest 

doctrine, and in every one of those, it has both said it 

has to be a lawful arrest. And then in five separate 

cases, it has explained what it meant by a "lawful 

arrest." And it can't be dictum. The evidence in 

Johnson versus the United States was suppressed. It has 

to have been the holding of the court.

 We think that that is a sensible rule for 

two reasons: It is what Framers meant. It cannot be 

the case that a Federal marshal, at the time of the 

framing, could go and just arrest somebody for a 

completely trivial offense -- that was a trespass -- and 

then search them. And, second, Justice Powell's 

concurrence in Robinson makes a lot of sense. But if 

you engage in constitutional --

JUSTICE ALITO: In Johnson, the search was 

illegal because they illegally entered the hotel room.

Isn't that right? So it didn't matter what happened 

after that point.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is not what the Court 

said. The Court was quite clear on this, Justice Alito. 

I just don't think there's two ways about it.  It was 

quite on all five of these cases.

 I'm not saying the Court couldn't have 

decided the case otherwise. That's true. I think the 

Court could have had a different rationale, but the 

point is it didn't. All of these cases cite each other. 

It's a uniform line of authority. It's not an accident. 

It's not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Court simply said 

we're going to use our Federal supervisory power and 

incorporate the State law of arrest. If we don't have 

another body of law, we're going to do it. It didn't 

say it was required to by the Constitution. That's not 

the way I read Di Re.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, then -- I don't know 

how you pronounce it either, but I do know that Johnson, 

Ker, and DeFillippo are cases that are against the 

State. They are not supervisory authority cases.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then you have three cases, 

not five.

 And, moreover, it's not enough of a big 

deal, so the State makes it suppressible. Otherwise, a 

-- and so now we're talking about minor things under 

State law that is secondary at the least.

 And there, when the policeman make a mistake 

about that, the reason we let him search is he might be 

hurt, the policeman. There's danger involved.

 And so I don't see why at the moment that 

rationale wouldn't apply just as strongly with a reason 

for it being unlawful under State but not Federal law is 

a violation of one of these subsidiary rules whether he, 

you know, thought the guy was going to keep driving 

under the suspended license or, you know, might be risky 

or might not show up.

good faith here which could be raised to a Fourth 

Amendment argument in a later case. There's absolutely 

no mistake. And we don't want to encourage officers to 

conduct illegal arrests and search people.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your 

answer.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. Thank 

you, Mr. Goldstein.

 Mr. McCullough, you have four minutes

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. McCULLOUGH

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. McCULLOUGH: Thank you.

 First, when counsel says that this is some 

kind of a unique Virginia statute, that's wrong. The 

brief filed by the ABA shows that all but nine States 

have enacted provisions that are similar, that involve 

restrictions on their officers' authority, and each of 

those has exceptions, and so on and so forth.

 So it is not a unique situation. You have 

clear rules. Why would you trade them in for a morass? 

An arrest is constitutional if the officers have 

probable cause to believe a crime has been committed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Any crime at all?

MR. McCULLOUGH: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Any crime at all; 

jaywalking, for example?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: That's -- that's correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: We would never know about 

it if the -- if the misdemeanor, or jaywalking offense, 

was not committed in the officer's presence.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: That's right. In the case 

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's not a problem for 

you here, but that is a limitation on what we have held.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: That's correct. In 

Atwater, a jaywalking arrest is constitutionally 

permissible. Atwater did not reach the in-the-presence 

question, and it is not presented here because the 

offense occurred in the officer's presence. So --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. McCullough, what is 

here, for some reason the Commonwealth did not cite 

Cooper v. California, which I can't understand unless 

you agree with your friend that it has been overruled by 

later cases.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: No. I think -- we relied 

on Greenwood, and so I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. Why didn't 

you cite Cooper v. California?

MR. McCULLOUGH: I don't have an explanation 

for that. We certainly think it strongly -- as the 

United States points out in their brief, that it 

strongly supports our position.

 And as the lower courts have noted when 

facing a similar argument, you've already held that when 

it comes to a search, that under Greenwood and Cooper, 

that State-law considerations aren't going to be what 

the constitutional inquiry turns on.

 Why would you have this incongruity where 

that's true in Greenwood and Cooper with a search of a 

residence or an automobile but then you have a different 

rule when it comes to an arrest? The States have been 

handling this problem, but it's an issue of State law.

 And the State here has never held, going 

back to 1924, that a violation of State law rises to the 

level of a constitutional arrest and -- or, excuse me --

that -- let me restate that.

 That a violation of State law warrants the 

exclusionary rule at the State level. So when the 

legislature enacted this, they contemplated that 

specific set of remedies.

 So, at the end of the day, we just ask the 

Court to adhere to its jurisprudence; that the arrest is 

constitutional because it is made with probable cause.

There was a violation of state law, but it wasn't a 

constitutional problem.

 And so we would ask the Court to reverse the 

judgment below.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. McCullough, there is 

one thing that I was curious about. It is this Virginia 

law that allows the custodial arrest pursuant to an 

order of a general district court.

 MR. McCULLOUGH: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When is that used?

 MR. McCULLOUGH: That is used with some 

frequency, and we certainly saw an increase in the wake 

of the Moore decision. I can't go county by county and 

city by city, but it has common currency.

 And one example is Portsmouth evidently, 

although it is not clear -- we have gotten conflicting 

answers. When Mr. Moore was arrested, there is no such 

order. But a few miles down the road the City of 

Virginia Beach does have such an order.

 And this just shows the complexities the 

Court would be stepping in where, if Mr. Moore is 

arrested in Portsmouth for the exact same crime on the 

exact same facts, it is unconstitutional under Moore's 

rule.

 But he goes a few miles down the road to the

City of Virginia Beach, and the arrest is perfectly 

constitutional because the district court has entered 

such an order. And it just doesn't make sense, as the 

Court noted in Whren, for constitutional provisions to 

be so variable.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What would be the basis 

of a -- can a district court enter such an order just 

because it thinks it's a good idea? Are there any 

grounds in --

MR. McCULLOUGH: The statute -- I see my 

time has expired. The statute at issue, 46.2-936, does 

not really lay out particular criteria. So it is -- and 

the issue hasn't been litigated in the Virginia courts 

as to the criteria that's required. But it seems to be 

broad discretion by the general district judge.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
