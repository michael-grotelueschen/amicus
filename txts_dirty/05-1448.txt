 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 05-1448, Beck versus PACE International 

Union.

 Mr. Baker.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. MILLER BAKER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BAKER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 After filing for bankruptcy, Crown Vantage 

decided to terminate 12 over-funded pension plans. By 

terminating these pension plans, Crown was able to 

provide its plan participants with 100 percent of their 

accrued benefits and at the same time recover almost $5 

million in surplus plan assets for the benefits of both 

Crown's creditors as well as plan members who made 

individual contributions to those pension plans.

 After Crown made the decision to terminate 

these pension plans, it received a merger proposal from 

the PACE union to merge the pension plan into the PACE 

multi-employer pension plan. Crown rejected that 

proposal. The Ninth Circuit held that Crown breached 

its fiduciary duty by not sufficiently considering that 

merger proposal.

This Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit 

for two separate and independent reasons. First, merger 

is a nonfiduciary plan sponsor function and Crown could 

not have had a fiduciary duty to consider the merger 

proposal by PACE. A series of this Court's decisions 

beginning with Curtiss-Wright and continuing with 

Lockheed, Hughes aircraft and Pegram hold that decisions 

to create, to modify, to terminate, or to amend pension 

plans are sponsor functions, settlor functions under 

trust law, that are not subject to ERISA fiduciary 

duties.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I could understand that 

if the plan is being set up or if there's going to be a 

change to the multiemployer plan while the business is 

ongoing. But in this situation, you, you say if the 

employer elects to have an annuity, then choosing which 

insurance company is going to supply the annuity, that 

would be a fiduciary function. Well, this is, the 

termination, the merger that's proposed here, is instead 

of having an annuity we'll put the assets into this 

other plan. It's quite different from choosing a form 

for an ongoing operation and saying, we're out of it and 

we're now going to try to distribute the assets in the 

way that will best protect the beneficiaries.

 MR. BAKER: Justice -- Justice Ginsburg,

that's not correct. The answer to that question is that 

a decision to terminate a plan or a decision to merge a 

plan requires that a plan sponsor consider as a 

threshold matter several factors. First, what will the 

plan form be of the acquiring plan? And PACE's proposal 

would have required the merger into a multiemployer plan 

as opposed to a single employer plan. That goes to the 

form of the plan. PACE's proposal would have resulted 

in a new plan sponsor and a new plan administrator. It 

would have resulted in a new dispute resolution 

mechanism. That goes to the content of the plan. And 

finally, most importantly, the PACE proposal would have 

gone to the level of benefits provided by the plan and 

the level of benefits, as this Court has repeatedly 

recognized is a decision that is a plan sponsor 

decision.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well if you're correct and 

this was a sponsor decision, not a fiduciary decision, 

let me ask you when you're wearing, when the company is 

wearing its sponsor hat and says we're going to 

terminate this plan, does it have a duty to consider the 

best interests and the security of the employees, number 

one, when it picks an insurance company? It can't pick 

some flaky insurance company if there is a much more 

solid insurance company, can it?

MR. BAKER: Justice Kennedy, it depends upon 

the function at issue. If the function is the selection 

of an insurance company to provide the annuity, that is 

a plan administrator function and it is subject to ERISA 

fiduciary duties. But you is to analyze it from --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if have this duty to 

consider the interest of the employees in selecting the, 

the insurance company, in selecting the amount of the 

annuity, etcetera, if you have that duty it seems to me 

that that's a fiduciary duty.

 MR. BAKER: It absolutely is, Justice 

Kennedy, Kennedy. But it is only in the context of the 

selection of the annuity that the plan sponsor, the plan 

administrator, must purchase after the plan sponsor has 

made that threshold decision to terminate the plan. 

There is that threshold decision. And likewise, merger 

is a threshold decision that goes to the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that's I think our 

sticking point. If the, if the plan sponsor decides to 

purchase an annuity, it's accepted I think by you and by 

everybody that there are two decisions being made. 

Decision one is terminate the plan. Decision two, 

distribute the assets by purchasing an annuity that 

gives the beneficiaries what they should get. And so 

on.

But when we come to the question of merger, 

you're saying there's only one decision, and I think 

that's where I'm having trouble with your argument. 

When we come to the question of merger, it seems to me 

there are two decisions again. The first decision is 

we're going to terminate the plan that we've got. What 

do we do with our assets. We have decided to merge --

one possible decision as an alternative to annuities is 

to merge the plan with, with another one. Why aren't 

there two decisions in the merger case just as there are 

two decisions in the annuity case?

 MR. BAKER: There are two decisions in a 

merger case and the threshold question, Justice Souter, 

is whether to merge. Whether to merge is a --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why do you say that's the 

threshold question? I thought the threshold question is 

whether to terminate what we've got now.

 MR. BAKER: That's a different question, 

Justice Souter. The question is whether to merge, and a 

question whether to merge goes to plan form, it goes to 

the content of the plan and it also --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If they say, look, we're 

not ending our plan. Let's assume you have an ongoing 

business and they say, we're just sick of the form that 

it's in now and we can get a good deal by letting

somebody else administer this, so we're going to merge. 

I can see that as a single decision.  But that's not 

what you've got here. As I understand it, the decision 

to terminate was made, it was over and done with. The 

question was what are they going to do with these 

assets? It's at that point that PACE arrived and said: 

Give them to us through a merger.

 I don't see how you eliminate the, the 

termination decision before the merger decision.

 MR. BAKER: Justice Souter, there are two 

different questions. One question is termination, one 

question is merger, and they're not the same. And the 

question whether to merge is a sponsor decision because 

you have to make those threshold questions as to what 

will the form of the plan be, what will the benefits 

provided be.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The form of the plan is 

going to be zero. Our plan is over. We are terminating 

our plan. What do we do now? We have two choices 

roughly, maybe three. We can either buy annuities, we 

can give the assets to the beneficiaries or we can give 

the assets to PACE in the form of a merger.

 MR. BAKER: It's not a disposition of 

assets, Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Are you saying you can't

have a merger of a plan that has already been 

terminated, so that the merger decision is necessarily a 

decision that has to be made before the termination --

before a termination decision.

 MR. BAKER: It is -- once a plan decision, 

once a termination decision has been made, and once that 

decision has been executed, it's impossible to merge the 

plan.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Baker, I thought your 

position in your briefs, and I don't know why you do not 

make this reply to this exchange, is that the merger 

with another plan is not a termination, isn't that your 

basic position?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's what I keep 

suggesting.

 MR. BAKER: Absolutely, it's not a 

termination.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Because if it were a 

termination, in a termination, you must distribute the 

assets to the participants. And here when you merge 

with somebody else, the assets are not distributed to 

the participants, but they are thrown into a pot with 

other people.

 MR. BAKER: That's absolutely correct, 

Justice Scalia.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree with Justice 

Scalia, that that's one answer. On the other hand, you 

have -- there are two arguments here. And what we are 

exploring now is whether this is a fiduciary obligation 

or a sponsor obligation.

 MR. BAKER: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we will have to assume 

for that -- if you can't do it by merger, then the whole 

case goes away anyway. If merger is not permitted under 

the statute, then we don't need to worry whether it's a 

fiduciary response, correct?

 MR. BAKER: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So what we're asking in 

the first part of this argument is whether or not it's a 

fiduciary response. And that's what Justice Souter and 

I are questioning. And it does seem to me, assume that 

there is a meeting of the board of directors, we think 

we are going to terminate this plan. At that point, 

choices are made as to how to terminate it. And it's 

difficult for me to see why the interests of the 

employees are not uppermost in -- in your duties, i.e. a 

fiduciary duty, when you decide how you're going to 

terminate it.

 MR. BAKER: The answer, Justice Kennedy, is 

that it is a business decision to decide in what form

the benefits are going to be provided. And the very 

choice between a termination and a merger goes to that 

issue. For example, in a merger, there is no automatic 

vesting --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why can't you say it's a 

business decision as to which insurance company you're 

going to select. Maybe you do say that.

 MR. BAKER: Because at that point, it's a 

mere execution of the prior policy decision.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's the way 

you characterize it. I don't know why it's mere 

execution, when it's an annuity and it's not mere 

execution when it's a merger, once the determination 

decision has been made.

 MR. BAKER: Because the merger decision --

you have to ask those threshold questions, Justice 

Kennedy, what are the level of benefits that are going 

to be provided in the acquiring plan. In a merger, 

there is no automatic vesting of accrued benefits as 

there is in a termination.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm just listening to this. 

It sounds to me as if you're saying, one, the employer 

decides to terminate, okay? Now that's done. Then we 

go to the next question. How would we terminate? And 

in respect to that, I think Justice Kennedy was asking,

as I heard him, don't you have a fiduciary duty when you 

decide how. And your answer, as I heard it, was yes, 

you do.

 And now there is a third question. Does 

what happened in terminating mean that although you have 

a fiduciary duty, you couldn't consider a merger, 

because that's just not consistent with the basic plan 

of terminating. Is that right? If it's wrong, don't 

even bother to answer it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He doesn't like to hear 

that he is wrong.

 MR. BAKER: None of us do, Justice Scalia. 

The answer to the third part of that question, Justice 

Breyer, is yes. But where I disagree with you is in the 

second predicate, which is that the -- the execution of 

the termination is necessarily --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why did you answer yes to 

his question, Justice Kennedy's, about the insurance 

company?

 MR. BAKER: Perhaps I was imprecise. If I 

was imprecise, I apologize. The answer is, it depends 

upon the function at issue. A broad generalization that 

any decision taken after termination is necessarily a 

plan sponsor function is just wrong. One has to look at 

the function at issue, and the function in connection

with a merger is a plan sponsor decision, because you 

can't get away from those threshold questions as to the 

form, the content, and the benefits that are to be 

provided in that plan.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't exactly the same 

point true with respect to purchasing annuities?

 MR. BAKER: Because the decision has already 

been made, usually it's in the plan document, to provide 

for annuities. And the only question is providing the 

annuity that is best suited to the interest of the 

principals.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What if the plan document 

doesn't say anything about what will follow termination. 

There is nothing in there about annuities. Is the 

annuity -- the decision to purchase annuities a decision 

subject to fiduciary obligation.

 MR. BAKER: You mean the decision to offer 

annuities? Yes, Justice Souter. The decision to offer 

annuities, that is the provision, the actual selection 

of the annuities -- and I note that the Internal Revenue 

Service will require --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The decision to -- to take 

the option of purchasing annuities or offering annuities 

to the beneficiaries, that is a fiduciary decision.

 MR. BAKER: No, Justice -- the -- if the

plan is silent --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If the plan is silent.

 MR. BAKER: If the plan is silent, and the 

plan sponsor -- and the question is, how do we 

distribute, the mechanism of distribution. That is a 

plan sponsor function in the absence of any provision --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What if they say, we will 

distribute by going to the top of the building and 

throwing the money out on the street. Fiduciary 

problem?

 MR. BAKER: Well, that would not be 

permitted by the, by the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right --

MR. BAKER: By operation of law, Justice 

Souter.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your 

argument was, once you make a decision to terminate, 

there are various rules that are triggered, you just 

can't take the money and run with it. You've got to 

make provision. And that merger was not one of the 

permitted ways of terminating a plan. Is that wrong?

 MR. BAKER: Well, that is a second argument, 

an alternative argument, Chief Justice Roberts, that 

merger is not a means of termination. But the threshold 

question is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe it's a simpler 

argument than this first one we've been wrestling with.

 MR. BAKER: Justice Scalia, they may have 

different issues associated with them. But the 

threshold question here is whether or not this is a plan 

sponsor decision. And a plan sponsor decision is always 

a decision that goes to the content and the form of the 

plan, as well as to level of benefits to be provided.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is what's really involved in 

this, who is going to get the $5 million reversion that 

you would get if you purchased an annuity? Is that 

what's really in dispute?

 MR. BAKER: That's what's really in dispute, 

Justice Alito.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I mean, PACE would like it, 

you would like it. I mean, how would a fiduciary decide 

between those two, if it were a fiduciary duty.

 MR. BAKER: Well, it's not a fiduciary duty. 

This Court's cases are -- the PBGC and the agencies 

recognize that the decision to terminate in order to 

recapture a reversion is perfectly permissible, so long 

as the plan sponsor complies with all the relevant 

requirements of a termination.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Justice Alito's 

question, and I have the same question. Let's assume,

A -- I know this is not your position -- but the merger 

is a permissible option. And B -- and I know this is 

not your position -- that this is a fiduciary 

obligation. I assume then you would lose, because the 

extra assets must go, the reversion interest, must go to 

the employees if it's in their benefit.

 MR. BAKER: If we lose on both the issues 

that we have argued, Justice --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the point is the 

$5 million is not going to these employees, it's being 

thrown into this vast sea of all these other employees, 

whose employers have not done as good a job of funding 

their plans. This is to the benefit not to the 

beneficiaries of this plan, but to other union members 

who don't have the luxury of having an employer who has 

overfunded their plan, and are trying to get that five 

million to help them, not your beneficiaries.

 MR. BAKER: Well, that's absolutely correct. 

The money here would have gone not to the plan members, 

but to another union.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then you say that if 

it's a fiduciary obligation, and the merger is a 

permitted option, that the administrator, A, can, or B, 

must still give the money back to you.

no. If it's a fiduciary obligation, the plan sponsor, 

plan administrator -- because now we're talking about an 

administrative function -- the plan administrator has a 

duty to carefully consider that option. It doesn't 

necessarily result in the money automatically flowing 

over --

fiduciary, can consider the interest of the employer as 

well as the employees?

acting as a fiduciary, can only consider the interest of 

the employees.

decision to merge are sponsor functions, the choice 

between the two is a sponsor function.

 The plan administrator has a duty to carry 

out the sponsor's decision to terminate the plan, not to 

revisit that decision by considering whether to merge 

the plan instead.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose the argument is 

made very forcefully that the insurance companies with 

these annuities haven't been doing so well, but there is 

this multi-employer plan that has been just performing 

so well, and so the -- an appeal is made to the company, 

you're going out of business, you're not going to be 

running a plan anymore. Put those assets, distribute 

those assets to the place where they will serve the 

employees best.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, that would be not be a 

distribution of the assets as a means of terminating the 

plan, but the employer as a sponsor could, of course, 

decide to merge the plan instead of to terminate the 

plan, if the employer made that choice.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You're making the same 

rigid argument that Mr. Baker made, that whatever the

termination, even though the company is going out of 

business, it's bankrupt, it's always -- a merger is 

always characterized as a sponsor business, not 

fiduciary.

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes. There are two reasons 

that I say that. First, even in the case of a sponsor 

of a plan that's going out of business, and that isn't 

going to be participating in any merged plan, the merger 

still is a decision to alter the design and composition 

and structure of the plan, as this case illustrates for 

the reasons that Mr. Baker said. That it's going to 

change fundamentally the plan from a single employer 

plan to a multi-employer plan, that it's going to change 

the -- who is the administrator, that it's going to 

increase the pool of participants, that it's going to 

affect the benefits, because the assets that were 

available to pay the benefits are now going to be 

available to pay benefits of other participants in the, 

in the successor plan, that the PBGC's guarantee of the 

benefits is going to be lower in a multi-employer plan.

 So for all those reasons, it's going to 

change, still change the structure of the plan. But in 

addition to that, the employer of -- the sponsor of this 

plan that would either terminate, or possibly merge, has 

a legitimate interest in choosing termination rather

than merger, because in a termination, the sponsor can 

obtain a reversion of the surplus assets, and still 

fully provide all the benefits of the employees.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could an administrator 

make that decision in its fiduciary capacity?

 MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor, and that goes 

back to a confusion that I think was -- was present 

before, that the decision about the distribution options 

at termination is a sponsor decision that the employer 

makes in the plan documents, because those distribution 

options are benefits under the plan.

 And while Section 1341(b)(3)(A), in 

isolation, might appear to permit the plan administrator 

to choose which of those distribution options that are 

in the plan to make available, other provisions of ERISA 

and the tax code prohibit the plan from vesting that 

discretion in the plan administrator.

 So in other words, the way it works is when 

the employer sets up the plan, the employer provides for 

the forms of distribution that are going to be available 

at termination. And those forms are just forms of 

benefits, optional ways of providing the accrued 

benefits to the participants. And then the participants 

get to pick among those options at termination.

argument? Why isn't it simply a question of construing 

the provision for options in the original plan.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, we think that one 

requirement is that it's consistent with the plan, and 

the plan didn't provide that here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why isn't --

MR. ROBERTS: Held it was waived.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why isn't the simple 

argument, you can't merge because the plan didn't 

provide that as an option.

 MR. ROBERTS: That would certainly be a 

basis on which the Court of Appeals could have correctly 

decided this case, other than the way it did.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Was that position 

presented, I should have asked you --

MR. ROBERTS: It was presented. The Court 

of Appeals held that Petitioner had waived the argument, 

based on the terms of the plan, because Petitioner 

hadn't made that argument in the bankruptcy court, even 

though the district court had actually addressed the 

terms of the plan, but mistakenly construed the plan to 

permit merger, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So we've got to assume that 

the plan is silent in the sense that, insofar as the 

plan documents are concerned, merger is at least a

possibility.

 MR. ROBERTS: I don't think that you have to 

assume that, Your Honor. I think that because the Court 

of Appeals vacated the district court's decision, you 

know, there is no decision on it. And if it's necessary 

to -- to resolving the questions presented, I think the 

Court could address that question. We don't think it's 

necessary to resolve the questions presented because we 

think that merger is a, is a sponsor decision as a 

choice to alter the design, composition and the 

structure of the plan even if it arises in the context 

of termination.

 And in addition, we also think that 

merger is not a permissible method of plan termination 

under the statute or PBGC regulations which treat merger 

and termination as distinct procedures. The statute 

requires that the assets of a terminating plan be 

distributed by allocating them among the participants of 

that plan. That just doesn't occur in a merger. 

Instead the assets are transferred to the successor plan 

and in the successor plan they are commingled to fund 

the benefits of all the participants in that plan.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could a plan document 

provide that upon termination the employer is entitled 

to a refund of any excess funding? And would that then

be binding on an administrator in a fiduciary capacity?

 MR. ROBERTS: The plan document could 

provide for a reversion for the employer and in fact 

this -- it does. But the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I take it the 

administrator would then have the duty to obey that?

 MR. ROBERTS: That. Yes, because that would 

be consistent with ERISA and the administrator has to 

follow the plan in accordance with ERISA.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why doesn't the 

administrator here take the position that it's going to 

reserve the five million for itself and merge what's 

left? If PACE wants a merger with what's left, fine; if 

PACE doesn't, end of problem?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, an employer, not an 

administrator could, could as a sponsor of the plan 

decide to do a transfer of assets and liabilities of 

some portion of the, of the plan assets and retain some 

assets in the plan.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: My question is why -- why 

isn't it an option here to say all right, number one, we 

got a $5 million surplus. We are going to terminate 

this plan and we are going to take the five million. 

Question number two, should we, should we use what's 

left to merge into the PACE plan? Is that an option?

MR. ROBERTS: What the employer would have 

to do would be make a sponsor decision to make a 

transfer of assets and liabilities to the PACE plan 

before terminating the plan. The employer could make 

that decision but that, that decision and the decision 

afterwards to terminate the remains of the plan would 

both be sponsor decisions that the employer wouldn't 

make in a fiduciary capacity.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: By doing it in that 

sequence could it reserve the five million for itself?

 MR. ROBERTS: It -- it could conceivably do 

that, Your Honor, subject to the fact that there are 

guidelines that the agencies have put out, the 1984 

joint guidelines that require in some cases, in order to 

prevent circumvention of the termination requirements, 

that require the purchase of annuities or the other 

distribution of the assets, that those guidelines 

require that if there is a spinoff or a transfer of 

assets that's followed by the, by the termination of the 

remains of the transferee plan, that in some 

circumstances annuities have to be purchased for the 

accrued benefits of the participants that are 

transferred into the other ongoing plan and that are 

going to be participants of that plan.

keep the five million?

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor but that would 

be a decision that they make as sponsor of the plan.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't care how they make 

it; I just want to know under the terms of the plan and 

consistently with ERISA, could they keep the five 

million and in some sequence provide for a merger with 

PACE? And I think you're telling me yes.

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor, subject to 

the fact that here it's quite possible that the PBGC 

would consider a transfer of assets and liabilities just 

to leave assets in a plan as a reversion, that they 

would be subject to that requirement. And so they would 

have to annuitize the benefits of, of the participants 

in the plan. Because the PBGC would -- would look at 

that and they would say that looks like an effort just 

to extract assets out of what's really an ongoing plan 

because the employer is not going to be participating in 

that other plan. The -- they are just stripping it.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Then why couldn't the PBGC 

say, you know, we are not quite sure how these insurance 

companies work. So we'll buy the annuity and then the 

five million is an extra guarantee to make sure the 

annuities are paid and that also goes to the insurance 

company?

MR. ROBERTS: If I could answer the 

question. The -- the -- they could not -- the plan 

administrator could decide to give the reversion to the 

employees and not -- not take a reversion. It could 

amend the plan to allow that but the point is it has a 

legitimate interest in taking the reversion and that 

that interest encourages plan sponsors to fully fund 

their plan, and depriving it of that would prevent them 

from that discourage full funding of plans.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIA P. CLARK,

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

 MS. CLARK: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court. It's notable that neither the 

Petitioner nor the Government in their arguments here 

has referred at all to the definition of fiduciary in 

ERISA. But that is the beginning point of every one of 

this Court's decisions as to what is a fiduciary 

function and what is not. The statute and I'm quoting 

from 29 U.S.C., Section 1002(21)(A), it's in the first 

page of the appendix to our brief, is that a person is a 

fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent that --

and then it goes on and there are three subparts, two of 

which are relevant in this case.

One of them and I'm taking them out of order 

because I think subpart 3 is the simplest way to resolve 

this case, "to the extent that he has any discretionary 

authority or discretionary responsibility in the 

administration of the plan." The other one that's 

relevant is subpart 1, which is "to the extent he 

has" -- "he exercises any authority or control 

respecting disposition of its assets."

 The reason that the plan administration 

subpart is the simplest way to resolve this case is that 

Congress in Section 1341 of 29 U.S. Code, and that's 

quoted just immediately below what I was just citing to 

the Court, specifically assigned to the plan 

administrator all of the decisions that must be made 

with respect to implementing the termination of a 

pension plan. Throughout that section, everything that 

must be done is stated specifically to be done by the 

plan administrator.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course this argument 

would not have any force whatever if indeed, 

transferring the assets to another plan does not 

constitute a termination of the plan.

 MS. CLARK: Justice Scalia, that of course 

is the second major issue in the case, and the 

Government's attorney admitted that in a two-stage

transaction, the assets and liabilities of a plan can be 

transferred to another plan, and the plan can be 

terminated and assuming the plan provisions are 

correctly in place the employer can take the reversion 

of any excess assets. And then --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But the first step would be 

the transfer. And at that, at that stage it would not 

be a termination and therefore it would not be within 

the authority of the administrator under this provision.

 MS. CLARK: Justice Scalia, the 

implementation guidelines which the Government attorney 

also referred to have as their entire focus to make 

certain that two-part transactions of just the sort that 

you have referred to are treated as a single whole in 

determining whether a plan has been legitimately 

terminated or not. The entire focus of those guidelines 

is, we are not going to permit an employer by separating 

things out into two parts, first the transfer of assets 

and liabilities, then a termination, to do in form what 

in substance is simply the continuation of the same 

plan.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine, but that still 

does not convert the termination decision into, into a, 

an administrator's decision, rather than a sponsor's 

decision.

MS. CLARK: I agree completely --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure, you can oversee it 

and make sure that there is no hanky-panky going on in 

the two-step process but the -- but the determination 

whether to terminate or not is a sponsor's 

determination.

 MS. CLARK: I agree completely, Justice 

Scalia. There is no question here but that the decision 

to terminate a plan is the plan's sponsor decision. But 

when the plan sponsor has made that decision and the 

question on the table is how shall we implement that 

decision to terminate, it does not matter whether that's 

done through a two-step transaction in which assets are 

first transferred to another plan and then the formal 

termination of what's left remains. The implementation 

guidelines make very clear that you can't tease those 

apart and say no, we are only going to look at the final 

step and that's a termination and nothing else is.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But they, but they don't 

say that in, in looking at the two of them, you suddenly 

transform the decision whether to, to transfer as -- as 

a termination. You transfer that decision from the plan 

sponsor to the administrator.

 MS. CLARK: No, Justice Scalia. The 

implementation guidelines did not address the question

of in what capacity these decisions would be made. My 

point in referring to it is simply to say that it is, it 

is a form over substance argument to say that there is a 

difference between decision to terminate in which the 

plan administrator then has a choice of implementing it 

by either transferring the assets and liabilities to 

another plan or purchasing an annuity, versus as the 

Government and as the, I mean as the Petitioner would 

have it, that that's a completely different transaction 

from merger as a means of implementing --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm puzzled. Can I just 

get myself straightened out a little bit?

 If there is a decision to terminate you're 

suggesting, you're suggesting that it's after that 

decision made, is made, there can be a decision to merge 

which would not be a termination?

 MS. CLARK: That is correct, Justice 

Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Your, your adversary --

MS. CLARK: -- that the termination decision 

has been made.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I disagree with you on 

that.

 MS. CLARK: I'm sorry; I didn't --

position that the merger would be not a termination.

 MS. CLARK: That is what my adversary says. 

And if I might focus on the termination section itself, 

29 U.S.C. Section 1341, their position has been that a 

merger with another plan is completely different from 

the purchase of annuities to provide those benefits.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It would seem to me that a 

merger is a continuation rather than a termination. And 

explain to me why I'm wrong on that.

 MS. CLARK: The Government's regulations on 

single employer plan mergers take the very clear 

position, and we cited them in our brief, it's the 

regulations under Section 414(1), the clear position 

that any time there is a transfer of assets and 

liabilities from one plan to another, whether a complete 

transfer or not, that is treated as a spinoff of a plan 

from the original plan and a merger of the spun off 

assets and liabilities into the other plan.

 So that merger is a more flexible concept. 

It is not just the all-in kind of merger where two plans 

merge and continue down the road as a single entity. 

Merger also in the Government's own usage describes a 

transaction in which all or some portion of liabilities 

and all or some portion of assets are separated from the 

original plan and transferred to the second plan.

Now, that being the case, the question 

really as to whether this is the proposed, the proposal 

of any merger -- and the question presented to the Court 

is in the abstract, is any plan merger an acceptable 

means of terminating a plan under Section 1341?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. And -- and the 

argument your adversaries make is that termination 

requires that the plan assets be distributed to the 

beneficiaries.

 MS. CLARK: Yes, Justice Scalia. That's 

what it says.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And that in the case of a 

merger the assets are not distributed to the 

beneficiaries, they are distributed to this new plan, 

which benefits not only the beneficiaries of this plan 

but the beneficiaries of other plans.

 MS. CLARK: Justice Scalia, we disagree for 

the following reason. Section 1341 specifically 

provides that the plan administrator implementing a plan 

termination may -- and here I'm referring to the 

language that's again in the appendix to our brief; this 

is the last page of that appendix, right at the top --

plan administrator may purchase irrevocable commitments 

from an insurer, that's an insured annuity, to provide 

all benefit liabilities under the plan, or, in

accordance with provisions of the plan and any 

applicable regulations, otherwise fully provide all 

benefit liabilities under the plan.

 Now, this Court just last week in James vs. 

United States construed a similar statute that had a 

list of crimes followed by the phrase or otherwise 

involves a serious risk of potential harm to persons --

I'm paraphrasing. I didn't get it exactly right. Both 

the majority and the dissenting opinion in that case 

agreed that an "otherwise" structure of this sort means 

that what precedes the "otherwise" phrase is taken as a 

baseline against which to judge what follows it, and 

that it tells you what Congress had in mind as something 

that satisfies in this case the distribution 

requirements of the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. But now, does 

indeed the transfer here meet the requirement of little 

(i)? Does the transferee plan undertake an irrevocable 

commitment to provide to these beneficiaries all that 

they're entitled to, even at the expense of some of the 

other beneficiaries of that plan? In other words, if 

the plan's investments go south does that plan have the 

authority to say, oh, you know, our first payments have 

to go to the beneficiaries under this plan that was 

transferred and the rest of you will get, will get the

leavings? I don't think that the plan has the authority 

to do that.

 MS. CLARK: Well, Justice Scalia, it does it 

in exactly the same way the purchase of an insurance 

policy to provide annuities from an insurer does. In 

each case the assets are commingled with the entire 

assets of the financial institution to which these 

liabilities are transferred.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought we 

just heard that the PBGC might look at it a little 

differently, that they are more comfortable with the 

annuity insuring that these beneficiaries get their 

benefits as opposed to just throwing the beneficiaries 

into a pool with your other union members.

 MS. CLARK: Mr. Chief Justice, it's very 

clear that if as we are correct -- I mean, as we argue 

here, if we're correct that it is a fiduciary 

responsibility for the plan administrator to select the 

option on the table that is most secure for providing 

the benefits in the future to the participants, that if 

the multiemployer plan in question were poorly funded or 

shaky for any other reason and there is a solid 

insurance company offering an annuity, that the plan 

administrator would --

in an awfully difficult position? I mean, you're 

representing the union, which has other members besides 

these beneficiaries, and you're saying even though under 

their plan the beneficiaries are fully protected with 

irrevocable annuities, we think they're going to be 

better off if they're thrown in with our other members 

and we get the $5 million to spread out, not to these 

beneficiaries but among all these other members. Isn't 

that an awkward position to be in?

 MS. CLARK: The plan administrator is the 

one that ultimately makes the determination. The union 

may advocate for what it believes to be in the best 

interest of its members, but the party that makes the 

decision is the plan administrator wearing a fiduciary 

hat under which it can make no decisions --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why would the 

beneficiaries be better off if there were a merger? 

What would their benefit be, as opposed to an annuity?

 MS. CLARK: Probably the single advantage to 

participants in a multiemployer plan is portability, 

which is to say some of these participants were working 

for employers that purchased facilities from Crown and 

if their employer participated in the multiemployer plan 

in the future they would be able to add to the benefits 

that they had accrued and perhaps to reach something

like an enhanced benefit at 25 years of service or the 

like. In terms of advantage to the participant in 

comparison to an annuity, that would be the major one.

 But I want to come back to why it is that 

the multiemployer plan distributes the assets in 

precisely the same way that the purchase of an annuity 

from an insurance company does.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it make a commitment, 

a commitment to fully provide all benefit liabilities 

under the now deceased plan?

 MS. CLARK: Yes, it does, Justice Scalia. 

The law requires that. In any plan merger or transfer 

of assets and liabilities from one plan to the other, 

the fundamental requirement is that all benefits earned 

to the date of the transfer must be protected on both 

sides of the transaction for all participants.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What's the -- I'm trying to 

work this out now. Suppose I buy the annuity for these 

employees from the X insurance company, all right, and 

so the insurance company promises when they retire we'll 

pay them a thousand dollars a month. Suppose the 

company goes bankrupt. Does the, what is it, the PGPB, 

what do you call it, the Pension Guarantee --

MS. CLARK: PBGC.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Do they pick up any

of that?

 MS. CLARK: They do not.

 JUSTICE BREYER: They do not, okay. So I'm 

trying to understand this, then, the reg under this, and 

it says: Administrator, you buy the, the annuity from 

an insurance company, for example, or do the same thing, 

get an irrevocable commitment in another permitted form. 

So one question is when they do that the administrator 

doesn't have to have any fiduciary thought in his mind.

 The second position is -- that's their 

position. The second position is, even if that's so, 

this is not another permitted form because a merger 

isn't a determination. And the third position is, 

that's what we were just getting to, is that we don't 

see any way in which this could help the employee. Now 

you say, oh yes, there is a way.

 Now suppose we're choosing between two 

insurance companies. Insurance company A says: We will 

pay precisely what is owed, precisely; we're as solid as 

a rock. Insurance company B is hungry for business, so 

it says: We'll give those employees exactly what's owed 

and we'll write each of them a check for $500. Now, is 

that something that means then -- remember, this statute 

says you have to get what they promised them and not a 

penny more. Is that something that the insurance, the

administrator then has to do? He has to take B because 

the insurance company is promising him a bonus?

 MS. CLARK: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well then, if not that why 

this?

 MS. CLARK: No. The Department of Labor has 

made clear that when making a fiduciary choice among 

annuities that are offered by an insurer, it is the plan 

administrator's fiduciary duty to look to the security 

of the benefit. That is its sole guiding concern.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And beyond as well? 

I mean, let's say we have 5 million extra dollars here. 

See, that's what I don't understand. If you're saying 

it's a fiduciary, I mean, how can they make a decision 

ever to do anything other than just give the five 

million to the beneficiaries?

 MS. CLARK: That would depend on the plan, 

Mr. Chief Justice. If the plan --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the terms, the 

plans terms here, did not provide for merger in the 

event of termination, right?

 MS. CLARK: No, we disagree. The district 

court determined that they did authorize the merger for 

this purpose.

the district court found that the argument was waived, 

or the court of appeals did.

 MS. CLARK: Justice Scalia, it was the court 

of appeals that held that the argument was waived. The 

court of appeals said that because this was not 

presented in the bankruptcy court that the argument 

would not be considered by the court of appeals in 

Petitioner's urging the court of appeals to overturn 

what the district court had done.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though the 

district court decided it? Usually in a waiver 

situation it's whether you argued it or whether it was 

addressed by the court.

 MS. CLARK: In this case, I could see a 

reason why that would make sense, because in the 

bankruptcy proceeding both parties presented evidence, 

and the interpretation of a plan document is like 

interpreting any other contract. You may have the 

opportunity to present evidence on what it means.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you're -- if you 

prevail here -- I mean, the reason we have a case is 

because the employer overfunded the plan to the tune of 

$5 million. If you prevail and they cannot get that 

back even after fully insuring the benefits for the 

beneficiaries, employers in the future will be very

careful not to put in one penny more than what's 

required to fund the plan; isn't that right.

 MS. CLARK: Mr. Chief Justice, I don't 

believe that that's the case, because the funding rules 

of ERISA do encourage employers to fund well at times 

when times are good. But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if you prevail won't 

plan documents or shouldn't plan documents be amended to 

say that merger is not an option and any reversion goes 

to the employer?

 MS. CLARK: That may well be the case, 

Justice Kennedy. Or they may say whatever the method of 

implementing the termination that the plan administrator 

chooses, it must provide for a reversion to the 

employer.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What possible 

equitable basis does the union have to claim this extra 

$5 million?

 MS. CLARK: The actual --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's not for these 

beneficiaries. It's for all the others. It's spread 

out among this pool in the multiemployer plan. These 

are the employer excess contributions. What -- looking 

at it as an equitable matter, what claim do they have to 

the extra money?

MS. CLARK: Mr. Chief Justice, I could 

answer that on two levels. One is that the record of 

this case does not preclude the possibility that this 

would have been negotiated to leave the reversion for 

the employer. But that's speculation because, since the 

fiduciary didn't go down that path, we don't know where 

it could have taken it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are there a lot of 

plans that look like that, that if there's extra money, 

we've overfunded that it goes back to the union, not 

back to the company?

 MS. CLARK: It never goes to the union. 

That would be violation of a different section of 

Federal law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The union plan.

 MS. CLARK: But to a plan. The reason --

and plans simply don't address this, except for 

authorize merger --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, how could the 

administrator, how could the administrator negotiate 

with the employer to give the $5 million back if it's 

with a fiduciary?

 MS. CLARK: If the employer had said, had 

amended the plan to say, whatever you do by way of 

terminating this plan, you must protect our right to the

reversion, then the plan administrator would have been 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose if it 

would have been amended. But what happens, what happens 

if the employer wants to continue in business, but 

simply turn the plan over to a multiemployer plan? Is 

that a fiduciary -- and you have an employer that wears 

two hats. The employer is also the administrator. Is 

that a fiduciary decision?

 MS. CLARK: No, Justice Kennedy, it is not, 

because there there really is an impact on the form and 

the amount of benefits that will be accrued in the 

future under an ongoing plan, as well as --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So then it's the ongoing 

significance of the decision to the employer that 

determines whether there's a fiduciary obligation?

 MS. CLARK: No, Justice Kennedy. It's the 

ongoing significance to the participants, because then 

what you have is truly a plan design decision, which 

does not come within plan administration, while in the 

case of a merger as a means of implementing termination 

the law fixes those benefits. They are what they are.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I can't see why it's a 

fiduciary obligation in case A -- a sponsor obligation 

in case A and a fiduciary obligation in case B. That

just depends on the sequence of timing.

 MS. CLARK: Again, it's not, it's not the 

timing. It's the context. In a case like this one, 

where the employer is clearly going out of business, 

it's talking termination, it's got annuity quotes on the 

table, it's, everything is the implementation of the 

termination of the plan. If instead this employer 

remains in business and is continuing to employ people 

who are going to be accruing benefits in the future, 

then that is the question of what are the benefits they 

are going to be accruing in the future.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But what about the 

employees who are on board at the time the merger 

decision is made? Are you saying that an, an employer 

who continues to operate can say, I'm going to merge my 

sound plan, I'm sick of having to worry about it, I'm 

going to merge this financially sound plan into plan A 

out here, which is very, very shaky, and I know 

perfectly well that plan A, you know, may very well 

collapse, but I don't care. I just want to get rid of 

what I have. Is that an option for the plan sponsor?

 MS. CLARK: That would be a plan sponsor 

decision, but the plan sponsor would be subjecting 

itself to obligations for future enhanced funding of the 

plan that it joins.

JUSTICE BREYER: Could you go back for just 

one second to Justice Alito's question, because that's 

what I'm having trouble with, because I think the 

question is what, assuming you're right on all the other 

points for argument's sake, but what is the advantage to 

the worker here? And the answer I heard you give was 

the advantage is, well, maybe the worker if he goes and 

works in the right place will get some more money.

 Well, and I wonder is that relevant. And 

you told me in respect to the two insurance companies it 

wasn't relevant. So if it isn't relevant in respect to 

the two insurance companies, how can that be relevant 

here, and if that isn't relevant here what is the 

possible advantage to the worker?

 MS. CLARK: Justice Breyer, I believe I was 

cut off and didn't finish my answer to your question 

when you asked it before. In determining which of two 

annuities on the table are to be chosen, the Department 

of Labor's instructions to employers have clearly said 

if they're equal on the basis of safety and security of 

the benefits, then it's appropriate for the fiduciary to 

take other considerations into account. So our position 

here would be that, by parallel to that, if the 

fiduciary were to conclude that the multiemployer plan 

is of equal safety and security to the participants

benefits that they have earned to date, it would then be 

able to take into consideration in the interest of 

participants any other difference.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So then you're saying that 

the answer -- we have annuity company A and B, they're 

identical, the worker has a pension that promises them 

$1,000 a month, not a penny more, and company A says, 

we'll give you $500 extra. Then in your opinion under 

the current regs and so forth, the administrator must 

choose that company; is that right?

 MS. CLARK: Only if the two companies are 

equivalent in terms of their security.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I said they are equivalent 

in terms of -- of the security and so forth; they are 

each good companies and one will write out a check for 

$500, which is what I thought my example was. And now 

you're saying under the law the fiduciary must choose 

the first but you're hesitating on that which means I 

think I don't understand it fully.

 MS. CLARK: I'm trying to make sure that I 

understand your question fully, Justice Breyer.

 The, the choice must be made and the 

Department of Labor's instructions to employers are very 

clear on this, in the interest of the security of those 

benefits which have been accrued, that's the guiding

principle, (i) single to the rights and interests of the 

beneficiaries. If they are equal, then the Department 

of Labor guidelines permit the fiduciary to take other 

factors into consideration. So that the first decision 

has to be made in terms of the security of those 

benefits that the individual has already earned.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't think, I just 

don't read 1341 the way you do. It seems to me that 

little (i) at the top of your page 2a is a safe harbor. 

I don't think that the, even if it is a fiduciary 

decision that he has to, once he has found an insurer 

that is rock solid, that is willing to provide all the 

benefit liabilities, I don't think he has to look 

throughout the rest of the world to see if there is 

anything that might be better for his plan participants. 

I think that's a safe harbor and if he purchases an 

irrevocable commitment from an insurer and then that 

insurer is as solvent as any other insurer he is home 

free. You're saying he is not home free. He has to 

consider little (ii) and see what other ways of fully 

providing all benefit liabilities might be better for 

the plan participants. I -- I think that's, that's 

placing on him an obligation that I don't see there.

 MS. CLARK: Well, Justice Scalia, a safe 

harbor doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't

appropriate for the fiduciary to consider other 

alternatives. It would mean I believe if he chooses an 

annuity that is a safe and secure way to provide the 

benefit and is equally good with anything else, he would 

be solidly protected from any challenge that a 

participant might make.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- excuse me. Excuse 

me. I'm just not sure I understand your answer.

 If the employer finds the rock solid 

insurance company under -- pardon me, the administrator 

finds the rock solid insurance company under Justice 

Scalia's hypothetical under (i) he must consider all 

other options under (ii)?

 MS. CLARK: If -- if options have been 

proposed and they are of equal or better security for 

the participants, yes, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And you're saying in this 

case, this is sort of the square one question that I 

want to be clear on. You're saying in this case simply 

that the employer had to give consideration to PACE's 

proposal rather than cutting off consideration, we 

presume in part, because of the issue of the $5 million. 

It had to think about it some more. Is that correct?

 MS. CLARK: Yes, Justice Souter.

(ii) that you're relying on begins by saying in 

accordance with the provisions of the plan, the other 

solution otherwise provides. Where in the provisions of 

the plan does it say that they will consider merger?

 MS. CLARK: That was what the district court 

found, that the provisions of the plan authorized the 

merger, as an option.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you know, is 

there a particular provision in the plan that says that? 

Or --

MS. CLARK: The district court cited what it 

was relying on; I don't have those at my fingertips.

plan or it just didn't exclude, the plan didn't exclude 

the possibility of merger?

term in accordance with means that it must not violate. 

It must be consistent with the terms of that plan.

just didn't say anything so it would be a choice. Just 

like it doesn't say, may not say anything about a lump 

sum, which would be an alternative. But your point --

 MS. CLARK: Certainly if the plan has a 

provision then it must be followed. If the plan is 

silent, Mr. Chief Justice, your -- your question 

suggests that there must be an affirmative authorization 

in the plan. The district court found there was 

sufficient authorization here in whatever form that the 

district court found satisfactory. And because that 

issue was not raised in a bankruptcy court there was no 

opportunity to present evidence on that matter.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do I understand that your 

position is twofold? One is you say you -- you put this 

on the table, the board was bound to consider it with 

their fiduciary hat. So it's not just that they were to 

consider it. But they had to consider it as a fiduciary 

and not as a sponsor?

First, I would like to return the Court to 

the factual context of this case. In this case, PACE 

made not a two-step proposal, PACE proposed an outright 

merger in which all assets and liabilities would be 

transferred to the PACE union. That's in the record. 

It's Plaintiff's trial Exhibit 25. And what's 

significant about the merger proposal that PACE sent to 

Crown is that this is PACE's merger proposal. It had 

Crown signing the merger in Crown's planned sponsor 

capacity not as a, not as an administrator but as a plan 

sponsor. That's what PACE proposed, recognizing that 

the decision whether to merge the plan was a plan 

sponsor function.

 I'd like to turn now to the question of the, 

also the second stage issue here. Even, even if this 

was a two-stage transaction, which was not proposed, 

each stage of that transaction is a plan sponsor 

decision. A plan sponsor has to make the decision 

whether to transfer assets and then a plan sponsor has 

to make the decision whether or not to then terminate 

the plan. Each separate stage is a plan sponsor 

function.

 In terms of the plan sponsor function 

changing because the company is going out of business, 

that simply cannot be. A plan sponsor function depends

upon what the function is, and it doesn't matter whether 

the business is going out of business or whether the 

business is an ongoing concern. If anything, because 

it's going out of business, it's important to protect 

the, the discretion of a plan sponsor.

 In terms of the contextual argument it's 

very important to note that nowhere -- that Section 1341 

which governs standard termination does not 

cross-reference mergers and the Section 1412 governing 

mergers does not apply to terminations. In fact the 

only place in the statute where the two words appear 

together is in Section 1058, in which the two procedures 

are actually compared to each other.

 There are some significant differences 

between termination and merger. In a termination, there 

is a reversion to the company. There is also reversion 

to employees based upon their individual contributions. 

There is no similar reversion in a merger. That is why 

a merger simply cannot be a method of termination. The 

two are different. You might have a two-stage 

transaction but they are two separate transactions each 

of which is a plan sponsor function.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not sure I understand 

what you mean by a reversion to the employees who have 

made contributions. They get their cash back?

MR. BAKER: Yes. If employees, under 1334, 

if employees have made individual contributions to the 

plan, it's not merely paid for by the employer --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. BAKER: -- the employee has a right to a 

pro rata percentage of the surplus plan assets in the 

event of termination. There is no similar right of 

reversion to the employee in the event of a merger.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What if the plan, the plan 

provides that in the event of a merger there will in 

fact be a reversion to the employees, if they've paid in 

too much or to, or to the sponsor if the sponsor has 

overfunded, and there will be no merger except on those 

terms? Is that enforceable?

 MR. BAKER: I'm not sure I -- I understand 

your question.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If the plan document says 

look, if we decide to merge, anybody who has paid in 

more than he has to, employee or employer, gets the 

money back or there's no merger. In other words it's 

going to be the terms of the merger that there is a 

reversion. Can a plan provide for that?

 MR. BAKER: A plan cannot provide for that 

because it would be contrary to ERISA, Justice Souter.
