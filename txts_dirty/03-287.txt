 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in 

Wilkinson against Dotson. 

Solicitor Cole.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. COLE: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court: 

Prisoners typically want two things: first, to 

improve their conditions while in prison; and second, to 

get out of prison as quickly as possible. Respondents' 

claims here are not conditions claims. They do not seek a 

larger cell or better food while in prison. Rather, their 

claims are about getting out of prison.

 Traditional understandings of habeas would 

suggest that these release-driven claims lie there, not in 

section 1983, and this Court's decision in Heck confirms 

that this common sense answer is also the correct answer. 

In fact, Heck establishes two bars, each of which 

independently prevent respondents from using section 1983 

to pursue their claims here. 

First, Heck establishes that civil actions under 

section 1983 cannot be used to collaterally attack State 

criminal judgments. Before a prisoner can advance a claim

under section 1983 that would necessarily imply the 

invalidity of such a judgment, he must first show that it 

has been favorably terminated. And Edwards v. Balisok 

confirms that quasi-judicial administrative decisions 

regarding the duration of confinement count as criminal 

judgments for this purpose. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it isn't just duration of 

-- of confinement. I mean, in -- in Balisok, what you had 

was a determination that the confinement would be 

definitely less as a result of the -- the good time 

scheme. The -- the gut notion behind Balisok was that 

what you were attacking would imply that the sentence 

itself was invalid because the conviction was and so on. 

We don't have that here. What we have here is a 

scheme that makes a -- a sentence that is imposed a more 

definite sentence. We know where in the range it's going 

to be reconsidered. And however that may be classified, 

it's not simply a Balisok situation.

 MR. COLE: It's arguably different than the 

good-time credits at issue in Balisok, as -- as Your Honor 

notes. However, I -- I would suggest that even with 

respect to good-time credits, often under many State 

systems, good-time credits have the dual effect of moving 

up the parole eligibility date, as well as potentially --

and in some States, it doesn't even have an effect on

JUSTICE SOUTER: Right, but that had --

MR. COLE: -- of the sentence.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- that had nothing to do with 

the rationale in Balisok, as I recall it. Isn't that 

correct?

 MR. COLE: Your Honor, the -- the Court --

that's -- that's correct, yes. And I guess what I'd --

I'd say is that what seemed to be driving the Court, 

though, was still the durational aspect of the sentence; 

that is, as the Court said in Muhammad, if a claim 

threatens no consequence for the duration of confinement, 

then that isn't a -- or that isn't a claim that should be 

brought in 1983. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No -- no question. But the 

durational consequence in those cases was a definite 

consequence of longer duration, i.e., a sentence in the 

first place, a sentence not reduced by good time in -- in 

the second example. Here, there -- there is no such clear 

consequence. Here, the consequence is that there will 

simply be a period of time before a sentence already 

imposed will be reviewed to determine whether, in fact, it 

will be shortened or allowed to run. And that's 

different. 

MR. COLE: I'm not sure it is, Your Honor. Both

of them are going to have definite durational consequences 

for confinement. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No -- no question about that. 

At -- at the level of whether there is a durational 

consequence, they -- they both have it. I -- I grant you 

that. 

MR. COLE: And, Your Honor, as far back as 

Preiser, this Court has noted that challenges to duration 

go to the very heart of habeas corpus. That's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The duration of -- of the 

sentence. And here, there's no implication at all that 

this sentence is in any way invalid, that the sentence 

itself or any portion of it is invalid because the parole 

would be a matter of administrative grace, but it doesn't 

-- the determination of parole eligibility or parole 

suitability does not go to the validity of the sentence in 

any way, shape, or manner. Does it? 

MR. COLE: Well, a decision from a Federal court 

-- and I guess -- I think the answer to Your -- Your 

Honor's question is yes, it does. And the reason I say 

that is I think we need to look to the consequences of the 

Federal court decision that would follow from the claims 

that -- that the plaintiffs -- or I'm sorry -- the 

prisoners here are advancing. 

The State of Ohio has made individualized

decisions with respect to each of these respondents that 

they should not again be considered for release from 

prison until 2005. The request -- the relief that they're 

requesting and the claims that they're bringing, if 

successful, would result in the Federal court undermining 

that State decision with regard to the length that they 

should be incarcerated. It goes directly to the -- the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It doesn't -- it doesn't 

shorten the length that they're going to be incarcerated. 

There -- there is no certainty that -- that if they win 

this action, they will be incarcerated for a lesser 

period, is there? 

MR. COLE: Absolutely no certainty of that, Your 

Honor. But there is certainty --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and there was in the 

other cases, wasn't there? In Balisok.

 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, I don't think so. 

I mean, prisoners could be released in the State of 

Washington before the terminus of their sentence. They 

might not -- it isn't as though they had to serve all the 

way till the end, less whatever good-time credits they 

had. They could easily be --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but --

MR. COLE: -- released prior to that time. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, indeed, but the -- but --

but getting the good-time credits entitled them to be --

be released earlier. They might have been released even 

earlier still, but their entitlement to be released 

earlier was a consequence, wasn't it? 

MR. COLE: It was, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And there is no entitlement to 

be released earlier as a consequence of this.

 MR. COLE: We --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You just get another hearing 

and maybe you will, maybe you won't.

 MR. COLE: That's correct. You'll -- you'll 

just get another hearing. But an important note on that: 

you'll get another hearing, and you'll get another hearing 

sooner than the State has decided that you should get a 

hearing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's true. So it makes 

it possible that you'll get released earlier, but -- but 

there's no assurance you'll -- really, the crucial 

question for me, I think, is whether -- whether this could 

have been brought as a habeas action. Could this have 

been brought as a habeas action?

 MR. COLE: Yes, Your Honor, it could have been 

brought as a habeas action. If you look at the nature of 

their complaints, they're -- they're clearly in custody. 

Habeas would require custody and violation of the

Constitution of the United States. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But they're just asking for a 

new hearing. They're not asking for an earlier release. 

What's your closest case that -- that would allow a habeas 

action which does not seek an earlier release but just --

just a hearing?

 MR. COLE: I think probably the Garlotte case, 

Your Honor, in which the Court allowed a habeas challenge 

where the only result was going to be to advance the date 

of eligibility for release from prison incarceration. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No. But it -- No, go on.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it -- it doesn't advance the 

date of eligibility. It advances the date at which the 

parole board will take another look. The only eligibility 

is an eligibility to take -- to have another look taken and 

not an eligibility for release.

 MR. COLE: That's true, Your Honor, but these --

under that understanding of eligibility, where eligibility 

means the first possible release date. But these 

prisoners are not eligible for release in the sense of 

it's not going to happen for them unless and until the 

next release hearing. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But if they are subject to 

another look, they are not necessarily then eligible for 

release. And I think that's the point that we're getting

-- let me -- let me ask a -- a sort of complementary 

question. 

Is there any reason that these --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this with an I or an E?

 MR. COLE: I was hoping for an I, yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: With an I or an E? 

JUSTICE SOUTER: With an E. With an E. But if 

-- if you take my questioning as a compliment with an I, 

that's perfectly okay too. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. COLE: I'll -- I'll wait and see what the 

question is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's see what it is. 

The -- the question is, could these claims not 

have been brought in advance of any application to these 

particular prisoners of the revised -- whatever they were 

-- the 1998 guidelines? And if the answer is yes, then 

they could be brought at a time when, I suppose, habeas 

would -- would not have been a possible remedy. Is -- is 

-- am I correct on those two points?

 MR. COLE: The State concedes that if they had 

brought this case before a parole hearing at which the 

guidelines were applied, that it would be a different 

case, and that 1983 would be a remedy in that -- in that 

situation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Here's -- here's the difficulty 

that I -- that I have. When I read your brief, I thought, 

well, he must be right because this is really about 

custody. It's really about custody. They want to get out 

eventually. 

But then when I -- I -- when I went back to 

Balisok, I thought, oh, here's the problem. The problem 

is that it's a damage remedy in Balisok. And normally you 

want the person to go into 1983 to get damages. But he's 

going to get mixed up. When do you send him to habeas? 

Well, we don't want to send him to habeas unless it's 

clear that habeas should have been brought. And so if 

he's just challenging, for example, introduction of Fourth 

Amendment violation evidence or something like that, don't 

got to habeas. Don't go to habeas. You didn't have to go 

to habeas unless you had to, unless you had -- unless it 

was necessary to upset the conviction. You see? That's 

why that language is there. Now, I got that far.

 Then I said, oh, I see what you do. We should 

have one rule for damages. Well, that makes sense. But 

there's no reason not to have a different rule when you 

have the injunctive action, and there maybe we could 

follow your rule.

 But the next thing I come across is a statement 

that says, no, no, the rule is the same whether you bring

a damage action or whether you bring an injunctive or 

declaratory relief action. And I said, well, why did we 

write that? You know, we're the ones who caused all this 

trouble. But the -- the -- well, because we didn't want 

to make it too complicated and -- and not have all the 

questions coming, well, what kind of an action is it 

really, et cetera. 

Okay. So once I got that far, I said, oh, well, 

I'm going to have to change something for you to win. 

Either I have to change the thing that says the damages 

should be the same as the injunctive, or I have to change 

something else somewhere along the line, the word 

necessary. I don't want to change the word necessary. 

Maybe I could change the other, but why bother really? 

Because all that's important here is people know which way 

they should go.

 Now, that's where I am at the moment, thinking 

give him his 1983 action. It's simpler. It follows from 

Balisok. Why not?

 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, there would be some 

real consequences that would follow from that. 

JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I thought. 

MR. COLE: The reason that it's important that 

these cases go to habeas rather than 1983 is because of 

the State court exhaustion requirement that's attendant

with habeas. Parole claims like those advanced here are 

often, if not always, intricately bound up with State law 

issues, and the State law is often going to provide much 

more meaningful relief than the Federal law claims that 

the prisoners advance. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't the Prison Litigation 

Reform Act require exhaustion even in a 1983 action?

 MR. COLE: Yes, but as Your Honor is aware, 

that's an administrative exhaustion requirement which this 

Court referred to in Nelson, I believe, as a substantially 

lower gate than the exhaustion requirement imposed by 

habeas.

 Moreover, it's telling --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is -- may -- may I just follow 

up on that question? At the administrative level, cannot 

these State law policies perfectly well be taken into 

consideration? In other words, your argument was these 

things are bound up with State law issues and the best 

place to have them resolved is -- is in a State forum. 

They can be resolved in a State administrative forum, 

can't they? 

MR. COLE: They could, Your Honor, but I -- I 

think the types of legal determinations with respect to 

legal entitlements and also the court -- we would assume a 

State court would also consider Federal claims that might

be made by the prisoners when they bring their State court 

claim. Those types of legal claims are better resolved by 

State courts. They have the expertise to make the -- the 

determination. And in fact, in Ohio --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, couldn't one say the 

same thing of prison conditions that you can bring in as a 

1983 action? The States know better about how their 

prisons are operating and what changes would have to be 

made. So I -- I think that you -- you may be right that 

the State knows more about how its parole system operates, 

but so does it know more about how its prison system 

operates. And that doesn't -- that's not what determines 

whether you have 1983 or habeas.

 MR. COLE: Well, but Congress, with respect to 

conditions claims -- and if you look at the language of 

the administrative exhaustion requirement in the PLRA at 

42 U.S.C. 1997(e)(a), it says no action shall be brought 

with respect to prison conditions under 1983 without 

administrative exhaustion. So even Congress, in thinking 

about the PLRA and in thinking about requiring 

administrative exhaustion, understood that 1983 is really 

about conditions of confinement. 1983 isn't about -- it 

never has been about -- release. 

Habeas has traditionally been the relief that 

people -- or the cause of action that people bring when

what they're interested in is relief -- or release from 

prison. And these claims, no one can dispute, are 

release-driven claims. They may not ultimately be 

successful in securing release, but the prisoners here --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, no, I've got that part. 

But the -- and -- and you're right about that part. But 

that -- you know, that doesn't get over the -- the hump 

here I think because of the -- what we've written. 

The -- I mean, where I'm coming out now, what 

you've just said, is well, you know, there's going to be 

exhaustion in both cases. And prison conditions, if we 

say that habeas doesn't -- that 1983 applies here I think 

probably -- I can't guarantee it -- but those where prison 

conditions would then cover it, and then there would be 

exhaustion, and there -- where it doesn't seem to make 

difference there. 

And now I'm back to asking the other half of 

this, which is, well, all right, suppose I say I see your 

point, I think you're right. Now, what -- what is your 

recommendation? What do we change? Do we change the word 

necessary in Balisok, which I'd be pretty reluctant to do? 

Or do we drive a wedge between the damage cases and the 

injunctive/declaratory relief cases?

 MR. COLE: I don't think you need to do either, 

Your Honor. I think if we go back to Heck and look at the

language there that talks about necessarily implying the 

invalidity of a criminal judgment, which is something --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, well.

 MR. COLE: -- respondents concede in their 

brief, the only question then is does a parole decision 

count as a, quote, criminal --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. No, but then what 

you're doing is taking the first half because what you're 

reading is you're reading that word necessary, whatever 

those words were in Balisok that we were just talking 

about, as your case satisfying that condition. And if 

your case satisfies that condition, then so does the case 

where a person wants to bring a damage action because of 

illegally seized evidence at his trial. Doesn't it? I 

mean, because all -- I mean -- and then we've swept --

then we've done -- we've really moved Balisok from what it 

was trying to do.

 MR. COLE: I don't think that's necessarily 

right, Your Honor, because the illegally seized evidence 

at the trial -- I don't know that that would necessarily 

imply the invalidity of the conviction that resulted from 

that trial. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Why is he bringing his damage 

action? He thinks he's bringing it because what they did 

at that trial hurt me. Now, how did it hurt me? It hurt

me because I went right to prison. 

MR. COLE: Right, Your Honor, and that -- that's 

absolutely correct, but I'm not arguing for, and I want to 

make it very clear that I'm not arguing for any rule that 

would turn on the subjective intent of the prisoner in 

bringing their claim. It turns on the necessary 

implication of success on that claim, and that's a -- a 

distinction that the Court made both in Heck and in 

Balisok. They looked to what's the necessary implication.

 So we look to the claims here, not why they 

brought them, but what are the claims. And the claims 

here, and the particular ones that I would focus on, are 

the ex post facto claims. If the -- if they have success 

on their ex post facto claims -- and we don't believe 

their claims are meritorious, but if they're successful on 

those claims, there's no way the State's decision can 

stand. They are entitled to a new hearing at which they 

would again be considered for parole --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but does that mean the --

the judgment -- the order denying release on parole is 

invalid? There are really two parts to it. One, you --

we're not going to release you. Secondly, your next 

hearing will be at a later date than you want. Insofar as 

you challenge the date of the hearing -- the date of the 

next hearing, does that necessarily imply the invalidity

of the entire order denying parole?

 MR. COLE: We -- we concede that if there's an 

ex post facto violation here, these prisoners are entitled 

to a new parole hearing. And I guess the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But they're not entitled to 

parole.

 MR. COLE: Absolutely, Your Honor. Absolutely. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: So that it doesn't totally 

invalidate the order that is at issue.

 MR. COLE: Well, the way that -- that I've been 

thinking about it is if you put the State parole decision 

up on the wall and you put the Federal decision up on the 

wall, one of them has to come down. The Federal decision 

trumps the State decision. It can --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, it doesn't entirely come 

down. It just -- half of it comes down. 

MR. COLE: No. The whole thing comes down, Your 

Honor. They're entitled both to an immediate new release 

hearing and --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But not for release.

 MR. COLE: -- if they're successful on their 

claims, they're entitled to more frequent release hearings 

in the future. So the decision, the State's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But -- but isn't it true that 

one aspect of your order that's under attack is they had

refused to grant them parole?

 MR. COLE: Absolutely. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And that remains. 

MR. COLE: It doesn't, Your Honor. They have to 

decide that again. That -- that order is void ab initio. 

It's as though it were never entered. They have to make a 

new decision about whether or not this person should --

should have parole and that they cannot in any way -- the 

State cannot rely on the prior decision that they reached 

on that issue. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I thought the only relief they 

were seeking was a more prompt next hearing.

 MR. COLE: No, they -- Dotson's complaint, I 

believe at page 20 of the joint appendix -- he wants to, 

quote, proceed toward a prompt and immediate parole 

hearing in accordance with the statutory laws and 

administrative rules in place when the plaintiff committed 

his crimes. They want an --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But aren't -- aren't those 

claims moot or academic now? Because, as I understand it, 

he has had another parole hearing. So he's -- with the 

hearing that he was seeking, he's already had another. So 

he's not complaining about the absence of a hearing or --

or flaws in the procedure at the hearing. I thought that 

this case now reduces to a clean question about the

retroactive application of the new guidelines. 

MR. COLE: Well, it isn't a clean question, Your 

Honor, because exactly the same error that he alleges 

infected his first hearing was present at his second 

hearing. If -- if you look at the materials that they 

added to their brief at lines 3, 7, and 8 where they have 

the new parole decision, it's clear that Dotson's 2002 

parole decision was predicated on exactly the same 

guidelines, exactly the same 1998 guidelines that he says 

violated his rights under the Ex Post Facto Clause. 

So, in fact, if anything, it's made his 

situation worse because a Federal decision on his claims 

now would both necessarily imply the invalidity of his 

previous hearing and the 2002 hearing, and the 2002 

hearing was a release hearing. Unlike the halfway review 

that occurred earlier, it was a full-fledged release 

hearing in 2002, at which the parole board decided both 

that he should not get parole then and that he should not 

again be considered for parole until 2005. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there -- maybe I'm wrong 

about this, but I thought there no challenge being made to 

the 2002 hearing.

 MR. COLE: But what Heck makes clear is it 

doesn't matter what you say you're challenging. What we 

need to look to is what's the necessary implication of

securing success on your claims in Federal court for a 

State decision. Here, the necessary implication, if 

they're successful on their ex post facto claims, is going 

to be that the 2002 decision can't stand, the 1999 

decision --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why can't it simply be that 

prospectively for this class of prisoner, the old 

guidelines will apply, prospectively without undoing 

anything that's happened in the past?

 MR. COLE: I think for the same reason that in 

Balisok I don't think there could have been a prospective 

order that said -- said something like the method you have 

for choosing decision-makers creates fraud, bias, and 

deceit, on a going-forward basis you must change that 

method for selecting decision-makers. Saying that you 

have to change it on a going-forward basis would mean, 

necessarily imply, that there had been fraud, bias, and 

deceit by the decision-maker that would mean that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think twice you started 

something and our questions impeded you. But I think you 

were equating the parole board's decision to a criminal 

sentence, and so you -- you were saying just as the -- the 

Federal authority can't come in and nullify the State 

criminal sentence, neither can it nullify the parole board 

determination. And -- and I thought that the comparison

between a -- a sentence -- a criminal conviction and 

sentence and a parole board's discretionary determination 

-- you seemed to be putting those on the same plane.

 MR. COLE: Not exactly on the same plane, Your 

Honor, but recognizing that this Court in Balisok said 

that post-judgment administrative decisions regarding the 

duration of confinement also count as criminal judgments 

that are protected for purposes of -- of the Heck 

doctrine. And in Greenholtz, this Court --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- but the -- the 

generality at which you keep referring to it, with respect 

to conditions of confinement, is a -- is a higher level of 

generality than anything that Balisok decided. In 

Balisok, the particular decision was a decision to revoke 

an entitlement to be released at whatever the date the 

good time would give, and -- and that is a much more 

specific -- I mean, that literally affects an entitlement 

to be released. It is not merely a decision with respect 

to length of confinement.

 MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, if this turns on 

whether or not it's an entitlement, I would agree with you 

that it seems good-time credits might be different from an 

entitlement sense than parole. 

But -- but all the way back, in tracing the 

cases from Preiser forward, the Court has talked about

duration of confinement, and certainly no one can argue 

that the decision here is going to have dramatic 

consequences for the duration of these prisoners' 

confinement. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: We -- we don't know what 

consequence it will have for the duration of his 

confinement. All we know is that it will have a 

consequence in determining the date at which the next look 

will be taken by the parole board to see whether he then 

is in a condition to be released. That's all we can tell.

 MR. COLE: That's correct, Your Honor, but 

they're -- they're pressing ex post facto claims. And as 

this point -- Court pointed out in Garner in 2000, they 

can maybe bring those claims based on changes in frequency 

of parole hearings, but they're going to have to show a 

definite impact on the quantum of punishment that they 

receive as a result of that change. So if they're going 

to be successful on their ex post facto claims, they're 

going to have to show an impact on the duration of their 

confinement. Either they have no ex post facto claim 

because there's no durational impact on their --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But you're -- you're 

assuming -- your argument now is assuming that they are 

going to be successful on this element, that you say 

they've got to satisfy later.

 MR. COLE: Right, but that's the Heck --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and whether they are or 

not has nothing to do with -- with Balisok and Heck.

 MR. COLE: I -- I disagree, Your Honor, because 

in Heck and Balisok, the Court said look to what happens 

if they're successful on their claims. So I'm -- we're --

the State is supposed to hypothesize that somehow they're 

going to be successful on these claims. We don't agree 

it's going to happen, but once we hypothesize that they're 

going to be successful on an ex post facto claim, it means 

they're going to have to show, have to demonstrate a 

durational impact on their sentence. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Sure. It also -- it also means 

that if -- if -- assuming your argument is sound, if you 

lose this case, you win the war. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. COLE: At -- at some level, I think there's 

an -- an inherent and fundamental tension in their 

position, and -- and the coin could flipped and conversely 

there's that same tension in ours.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are -- are you sure that that's 

what they have to prove, that -- a durational impact? 

Wouldn't it be enough to show that they were deprived of 

an opportunity to have the sentence shorter? Wouldn't --

wouldn't it -- assuming there was an ex post facto

violation, wouldn't that be enough of an injury, that they 

lost an opportunity to have their sentence shortened?

 MR. COLE: But, Your Honor, I believe what makes 

out the ex post facto claim is an increase in the quantum 

of punishment after they've committed their crimes. So 

they need to show that as an element. 

I -- I see -- I'd like to reserve the remainder 

of my time for rebuttal, if I could.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN Q. LEWIS

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT JOHNSON

 MR. LEWIS: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court:

 This case presents a straightforward opportunity 

to apply the Heck rule. Respondent Johnson's section --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you tell us why -- why is 

it still live when they -- when they already received a 

second hearing? Or why is not moot?

 MR. LEWIS: Johnson still has remaining claims 

for prospective injunctive relief in this case and, as 

well, declaratory relief. What may be mooted is his claim 

for retroactive injunctive relief, in other words, a new 

parole hearing. I think in order for him to pursue that 

type of a claim, he'd have to go back down to the district

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, put in plain language 

what it is Johnson is claiming he's entitled to. I don't 

understand. 

MR. LEWIS: Well, he -- really three different 

things. He's requesting prospective injunctive relief, 

fix the due process violations that are going on in Ohio 

parole proceedings. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is a new -- a new parole 

hearing. Isn't -- I mean, it -- I --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: How could that be fixed?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. How -- how can it be 

fixed except by giving him a new parole hearing?

 MR. LEWIS: Well, he does have a class action. 

He filed a class action and he's trying to fix the 

proceeding prospectively. It doesn't necessarily require 

him to have a new parole hearing. He's still in 

confinement and will very likely have a new parole 

hearing, a new parole hearing that he wants the 

proceedings to be different in. He's not necessarily 

asking for a new parole hearing. He's saying --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't he? If -- if -- what 

he's saying is the past proceedings were invalid, I want 

you to do it right in the future.

was still wrong. 

MR. LEWIS: Well, we don't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: His claims here -- if his claims 

here are correct.

 MR. LEWIS: We don't know that for sure, but 

part of his claim as well is to say in future parole 

hearings that I'm going to be subjected to, even if you 

don't give me a new one, in future parole hearings that 

I'm going to be subjected to, I want these processes fixed 

to -- to come into compliance with due process. And I 

think that's separate and apart from --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you say we don't know 

whether the -- the new parole hearing he got was still 

invalid?

 MR. LEWIS: I don't think there's enough in the 

record to determine that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, so we can assume that that 

was valid. You're -- you're willing to assume that for 

purposes of this case?

 But I take it your claim is in the year 2009 he 

will have another hearing.

 MR. LEWIS: Actually 2005. 

JUSTICE BREYER: 2005? Okay, 2005 he'll have 

another hearing.

not to have the -- what are they called? The 1998 

guidelines. I don't want my 1998 guidelines applied in 

the 2005 hearing because you have some theory, maybe good, 

maybe bad, but it's a theory that that would violate the 

Constitution of the United States. 

MR. LEWIS: That's correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So you're saying he's going to 

have this. I want an injunction or declaratory relief 

they can't do it.

want to be heard at this next parole hearing. Now, that 

was -- part of his due process allegations in this case 

were that he -- he wasn't even allowed to meaningfully 

participate in --

JUSTICE BREYER: And he's saying it violates the 

Constitution in two respects: one, they won't listen to 

me; and two, they apply the 1998 guidelines. 

MR. LEWIS: That's essentially it. 

JUSTICE BREYER: That's it. Okay. We're 

talking now about this 2005 hearing and he wants new 

procedures, and the question is, is this 1983 or is it 

habeas?

 MR. LEWIS: That's -- that's correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 

MR. LEWIS: And -- and it is section 1983 

because it doesn't violate the Heck rule. This --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And what -- what is your --

what is Johnson's mootness argument? 

MR. LEWIS: Well, to the extent in his complaint 

he was seeking a new parole hearing as a result of the 

challenge to the '99 decision, that's probably mooted 

because he has received this 2001 hearing and we just 

don't know enough about it to know whether he's going to 

challenge it or not. He'd have to amend his complaint in 

the district court.

 MR. LEWIS: I don't think so. I don't think 

that Johnson has a Federal habeas remedy here because the 

Federal habeas statute is a challenge to the legality of 

custody, the legality of confinement, and that's not 

anything that he's challenging in this case. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What would you do if there was 

an allegation of a serious procedural flaw in a past 

hearing? The parole commission was -- was drunk or they 

read the wrong file or something, and it was just a 

challenge to the invalidity of the past hearing. Would 

that be 1983 or habeas?

 MR. LEWIS: I think that's a closer call, but I 

think it --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's why asked you. Why 

isn't it --

(Laughter.) 

MR. LEWIS: Right. And -- and I -- I think it 

is still section 1983 if certain things are present. That 

is, is he going to necessarily imply the invalidity of the 

duration of his sentence by winning his case? And if

that's meets the Heck rule and if he isn't, then I think 

he can proceed in section 1983.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we have any case in which 

what was being -- what was sought to be challenged in a 

habeas action was not the duration of the sentence, but 

the procedure by which the duration of the sentence was 

determined? 

MR. LEWIS: I don't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any -- why -- why 

shouldn't that be a habeas action? Why shouldn't 1983 be 

limited to prison conditions, which is what we've always 

-- and referred to it as -- as that in the past?

 MR. LEWIS: Well, I think in the hypothetical 

that you've presented, Justice Scalia, if the prisoner 

wins the case in that particular case, then his sentence 

is invalidated, and I think that's the important critical 

factor here. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no, not necessarily. 

He -- he's just saying the parole hearing I got lacked due 

process safeguards. Had I had those safeguards, I might 

-- I might -- have been given a shorter sentence. I can't 

prove I would have. I'm not challenging the sentence 

really, but I want a new hearing. I didn't get due 

process. Give me a proper hearing because I might get out 

earlier. Why shouldn't that come under habeas?

 MR. LEWIS: Because it's not a challenge to the

JUSTICE BREYER: My law clerk found two cases 

which we've just looked at briefly. One is called 

Wilwerding v. Swenson and the other Johnson v. Avery where 

she says that in those two cases people were using habeas 

to challenge prison conditions even. Now, so there are --

there are two cases that, if she's right -- and she's 

usually right -- that -- that -- where habeas was used to 

challenge prison conditions. So I've thought, well, if 

they can use it, they certainly could use it here.

 MR. LEWIS: Well, and I -- I think point with --

with both of those decisions is that the Heck rule did not 

come into play because the prisoners must have gone 

through and exhausted their State court remedies, and so 

there wasn't an issue as to whether they must bring their 

claim in habeas. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No. It was a different issue, 

but it said habeas could be brought. 

MR. LEWIS: Sure. I think the Court in -- in 

that particular case --

JUSTICE BREYER: So habeas could be brought 

here?

 MR. LEWIS: I don't think so.

 MR. LEWIS: I don't think there's a remedy in 

habeas for the respondent Johnson in this case because the 

first thing that's going to be asked when he goes to the 

Federal district court to seek habeas relief is, well, are 

you challenging the legality of your custody? 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, and they say sure -- sure 

I am. I'm saying I had terms. You know, I was going to 

be here under conditions A, B, C, and A, B, C in my 

opinion mean I will be released sooner, and instead, they 

gave me D, E, F, and D, E, F means I'm likely to be 

released later. I can't guarantee it. That's what he'll 

say. He says I can't guarantee it, but I wouldn't be 

bringing this case if I didn't think at least it was a 

shot.

 MR. LEWIS: Right. And -- and -- but he's not 

necessarily challenging the legality of his custody. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but -- but that's part 

of the conclusion that we're going to have to reach to --

to resolve the case. Why isn't he? How is that that much 

different than if a judge -- let's assume, under a proper 

sentencing guideline scheme, the judge just uses the wrong 

guideline. The man is going to go to jail for either 5 or 

10 years. We don't know which. But that's -- that's a 

classic habeas case. Here, he's going to stay in a prison 

for 5 or 10 years. We don't know which. Why isn't this a

classic habeas case?

 MR. LEWIS: Because I think in -- in the first 

hypothetical, Your Honor, that -- that you gave, the 

challenge, if successful, would -- would completely 

invalidate the sentence that he received. They'd have to 

redo the -- the sentence.

 And -- and I think that's the critical 

distinction in this case, is that when Johnson files his 

complaint, he has a 10- to 30-year sentence by the -- by 

the State court. If he wins, he still has a 10- to 30-

year sentence. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it wouldn't completely 

invalidate the sentence. We know that he's still going to 

be held and he's going to be held in custody. It's a 

question of how long, which is exactly what this case is.

 MR. LEWIS: But in the hypothetical you propose, 

Justice Kennedy, the -- the prisoner was actually -- would 

be actually challenging the sentence he received, and by 

winning the case, he's going to undo the State court 

sentence. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, those cases happen 

to involve -- happen to involve sentences. This case 

doesn't involve a sentence. It involves an opportunity to 

have his sentence shortened. And if habeas can be brought 

for that, we would phrase it differently. We wouldn't say

it would have to invalidate the sentence. We would say it 

would have to invalidate the proceeding that could have 

shortened his sentence. I grant you we can't use the same 

language we did in the earlier cases, but if this is 

properly a habeas action, then we -- we can get some 

language to make it fit. 

MR. LEWIS: Well, I don't -- I don't think it is 

properly a habeas action. I think even in the decisions 

where courts may have heard similar claims in habeas, I 

think it was a matter of just saying, well, the prisoner 

is already here. He's already exhausted all of his State 

court remedies. It doesn't really matter whether it's 

section 1983 or habeas. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we wrote an opinion 

that said, whatever the reasoning -- I don't know what it 

would be right now -- that said in the future your client 

should go ahead in 1983. I'm putting you in a slightly 

awkward position, so don't answer if you don't want to. 

But I mean, for the future all these cases will be brought 

in habeas. Now, suppose that's what the opinion said. 

We're absolutely making it clear just what the -- would 

there be any harm done?

 MR. LEWIS: I -- I think there would be. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, what would that harm be?

 MR. LEWIS: I think that by -- by having a rule

of that sort, that it would be expanding the jurisdiction

cognizable section 1983 claims. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And why would that be bad? 

JUSTICE SOUTER: And why --

MR. LEWIS: I'm sorry? 

JUSTICE BREYER: Why would that be bad?

 MR. LEWIS: Well, because the Congress has 

enacted a statute --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. But I mean, is -- I'm 

asking you a practical question as a practicing lawyer. 

Would it be bad?

 MR. LEWIS: Absolutely it would. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Because? 

MR. LEWIS: Because there's a statute that 

allows --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, leaving aside --

Congress changed the statute. It says absolutely it's 

going to be habeas. Is there any bad consequence in the 

law? 

MR. LEWIS: It's going to give States a license 

to violate civil rights that will otherwise not be 

protected under the statute. 

JUSTICE BREYER: We'll catch them in habeas. 

MR. LEWIS: Yes, but the -- the State exhaustion

requirements in habeas are much tougher. Of course, the 

State wants them to have to go through State exhaustion.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Ah, so it comes down to that.

 MR. LEWIS: That's really the critical --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You said -- you said a moment 

ago that it would be expanding habeas, and I'd like you to 

expand on that. It would be expanding habeas, I am 

assuming, because in every successful habeas case, the 

ultimate remedy that the court can order, if the State 

does not snap to it, is the immediate release of the 

prisoner. And I take it when you said it would expand 

habeas, it would expand it because this would not be an 

immediate release case no matter what. Is that correct?

 MR. LEWIS: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. LEWIS: You would basically end up going to 

a Federal district court seeking habeas relief asking for 

processes to be changed prospectively. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: And that's why they could not 

bring habeas in this case because if they won, they still 

would not have shown anything that entitled to them to get 

out now or get out now unless the State within 30 days 

does something. Is -- is that the nub of it?

 MR. LEWIS: That's -- that's really it, Justice 

Souter.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm not sure. It 

depends how you formulate the order. The -- the judge 

says, I'm going to order this prisoner released unless, 

within 6 months, he has a parole hearing under the 

guidelines I set. That's the way the habeas statute 

works. 

MR. LEWIS: Well, if that's the relief that the 

-- the prisoner was seeking, I think that is clearly a 

habeas claim. But that's not what Johnson is claiming in 

this case. He's not asking for entitlement to release at 

all. He's asking for the processes to be changed 

prospectively for future parole hearings, and he's asking 

for declaratory relief. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Regardless of what he's asking 

for, if he got what he wanted, he still would not be 

entitled to any immediate release. 

MR. LEWIS: That's absolutely correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: He would still have a sentence 

of X years, and the question is, how often are we going to 

look at him to decide when, within X years, we may let him 

out. Is that --

MR. LEWIS: That's -- that's absolutely it. He 

cannot -- by winning his case, he's not going to shorten 

his sentence in any way. And that's -- that's a big 

distinction from the Balisok case where there was an

automatic entitlement to a shorter sentence --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he might --

MR. LEWIS: -- for Balisok in that case. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- he might shorten the term 

of his confinement.

 MR. LEWIS: Might but not necessarily. And this 

Court made very clear most recently in the Nelson 

decision --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you could say the same 

thing when you're challenging the sentence. He might but 

he might not. We're just -- we're just hearing the case.

 MR. LEWIS: I think a challenge to the sentence 

necessarily invalidates that sentence if you win. But a 

challenge to parole is much different because you're not 

affecting the sentence if you win your case. And the term 

necessary is completely necessary to the Heck analysis, as 

this Court made clear most recently in the Nelson case 

from last term. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's the nub of it I guess. 

The fact that he may be granted parole has no implication 

for the validity of the sentence. 

MR. LEWIS: That's absolutely right. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: In fact, it assumes the 

sentence is valid, but that he will probably stay clean if 

he gets out. That's all it means, isn't it?

 MR. LEWIS: That's really all it means. And 

this Court last term in Muhammad in -- in footnote 1 made 

clear that the incarceration that matters for this 

analysis is the -- in the incarceration of the sentence 

from the State court. And I think that's -- that's what 

the Court needs to look at, is what is Johnson's effect on 

the State court judgment or sentence. What's the 

necessary implications? Not in this case at all. 

And really, this case I think has already been 

decided by Wolff. It's something that the petitioners 

sort of don't mention too much in their briefs. In Wolff, 

the prisoners in -- in that case were trying to get their 

good-time credits back. I think this is an easier case 

than the Wolff decision. And what the Court did was parse 

out, okay, you can't get your good-time credits back, but 

you can seek prospective injunctive relief to fix the 

processes that are used in connection with depriving 

prisoners of good-time credits. And that's precisely what 

Johnson is seeking here.

 Your Honor, the other thing I wanted to mention 

was the notion -- Your Honors, the other thing I want to 

mention was the notion that there's no State review of 

these decisions. The Prison Litigation Reform Act clearly 

provides for State administrative review of even 

challenges to the process. So the -- the State of Ohio

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Untereiner, is it?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN E. UNTEREINER

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT DOTSON

 MR. UNTEREINER: Yes, Justice Stevens. 

Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:

 I'd like to, first of all, go to the point that 

Justice Ginsburg raised about the allegations in Mr. 

Dotson's complaint. This case has -- has become much 

simpler with respect to Dotson because any claim that he 

might have had about this 2000 scheduling decision has 

been mooted. 

What's really left are claims for future 

injunctive relief, for prospective relief. These are 

classic 1983 type cases. Prisoners have been bringing 

lawsuits since Wolff against McDonnell alleging that 

parole procedures and other kinds of procedures, 

disciplinary procedures ought to be reformed and seeking 

future injunctive relief with respect to those kinds of --

of procedures. 

In Edwards against Balisok, this Court indicated 

that ordinarily claims for prospective injunctive relief

will not be barred by the Heck doctrine because ordinarily 

they will not call into question or necessarily imply the 

invalidity of any previous decision. So to Justice 

Breyer's question, this would require a change in the law, 

and it would, I think, fairly substantially cut back on 

the kinds of suits that have been brought for 30 years 

under Wolff because in all kinds of suits like this, the 

State would argue, as the petitioners are arguing today, 

that there's some prior administrative decision that's 

called into question by a future claim for injunctive 

relief with respect to some aspect of the procedures 

relating to good-time credit revocation or parole or the 

revocation of probation. So I think this would be a 

fairly substantial change in the law. A lot of these 

claims would be barred by Heck. 

The -- Justice Scalia, you asked a question 

about the habeas, the scope of habeas relief. And I think 

it's important to understand that the lower courts have 

generally held that habeas is not available for these 

kinds of claims that are prospective only, seeking changes 

in future procedures. There are some lower court cases 

that say that where a prisoner seeks release on parole and 

demands a right or claims a right to release on parole, 

that might be cognizable in habeas, but the vast weight of 

authority in the lower courts is that claims that only

seek an -- the right to a new parole hearing, the outcome 

of which is completely discretionary --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want a 1983 hearing in 

which a United States district judge tells the parole 

commission, now, here are your marching orders for future 

cases. You have to comply with this rule, that rule, this 

rule. What is an analog that you can give us where United 

States courts have done this under 1983? Using an 

administrative case, if the -- if the agency does it the 

wrong way, we reverse that decision. It would be like a 

review of a conviction that's not final. Have we had 

cases where under 1983 litigants come in and say, now, 

these agencies are doing it the wrong way? You have to --

can you give me an analog? 

MR. UNTEREINER: I think there -- there are a 

fair number of cases in the lower court where -- lower 

courts where these types of claims for injunctive relief 

have been brought and the Federal courts have ordered, on 

a prospective basis, that the States conform to all kinds 

of -- I mean, Wolff is a case like that I think where the 

-- the State was required to do certain things in the 

future. So I think these are ordinary 1983 claims for 

injunctive relief. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any significant 

difference between this case and Wolff? I mean, Wolff was

a case of procedural fault supposedly, and if those faults 

were cured, someone would have a better chance at getting 

good-time credit. Wasn't that what --

MR. UNTEREINER: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it seems to me it's very 

-- very close to your situation. 

MR. UNTEREINER: It is very close, Justice 

Ginsburg. Dotson is essentially making two claims for 

prospective relief. He is saying that these 1998 parole 

guidelines effectively rescind his eligibility for parole. 

At the time of his conviction, he was entitled to parole 

after serving 15 years. Under these guidelines, he'll 

have to wait till -- until 32 and a half years have passed 

before he's eligible for parole. And he's claiming that 

in -- in his next parole release hearing, which is in June 

2005 and beyond, the State is required to apply the old 

rules to him so that he'll be eligible. So this is very 

much like what was at issue in Wolff. 

The second claim he has is that he's entitled to 

annual parole release hearings in the future. Again, it's 

a future -- it's a prospective claim only. In the future, 

he will be entitled to annual parole release hearings, and 

the new rules say that the State can postpone those 

hearings for up until 10 years. 

So on both of those claims, he is seeking

changes in the future, and these are classic 1983 type 

cases that have been brought, as I say, for the last 30 

years in the lower courts.

 Now, the Heck test requires a showing that if he 

prevails on his section 1983 claims, he would -- that 

would necessarily imply the invalidity of his underlying 

conviction or sentence. And I think this case is very 

different from the Balisok case. There -- there was a 

colloquy about that earlier. I think that Balisok is 

clearly distinguishable because the administrative 

decision there would have had an immediate and direct 

impact on the duration of the prisoner's sentence by -- by 

revoking the good-time credits. Whereas, here, the impact 

is very, very speculative. 

Justice Souter, you referred earlier to a 

durational consequence. The durational consequence here 

is really quite hypothetical and remote. If he prevails 

on his 1983 claims, all he will be entitled to are future 

hearings, and since parole is entirely discretionary in 

Ohio, we can't predict the outcome of those proceedings. 

He'll also be entitled to -- merely to be considered 

eligible for parole in the future. So I think that the --

the consequences -- any impact on -- on the duration of 

his confinement is -- is really quite hypothetical here 

and it would require an expansion not only of the Heck

rule but also of habeas jurisdiction to resolve this case 

in the State's favor.

 Unless there are any further questions, we would 

ask that the Court affirm the Sixth Circuit's unanimous 

decision in favor of Dotson. All 11 members of that court 

found that Dotson's claims were not barred by Heck, and 

this Court should affirm. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Cole, you have about 4 and a half minutes 

left. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. COLE: Thank you, Your Honor. 

A number of points. I wanted to start by 

responding to Justice Souter's question, which was again 

asking about this need for entitlement to early release 

as part of habeas, and would ask the Court to consider the 

In re Braden case where a prisoner in Alabama was seeking 

to challenge a detainer that had been issued by Kentucky. 

And the basis for the challenge to the detainer in habeas 

was the fact that it was having implications for his 

parole eligibility in Alabama. So there, there was not 

going to be necessarily an entitlement to earlier release, 

but simply a difference in the parole considerations.

 Second, Justice O'Connor, with respect to your

questions about mootness, the only point that I would add 

is that if this case is moot now, it was moot when the 

Sixth Circuit decided it as well. So if mootness is the 

direction we're going, I think there need to be a decision 

vacating the judgment below --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what's your position as 

to whether or not it's moot?

 MR. COLE: Your Honor, we don't believe it's 

moot either, and in -- in fact, for two reasons. First, 

once again, it's threatening consequences for an existing 

decision, albeit it not the one that was originally 

threatened or where invalidity would be implied below, but 

there is a new one where that would have that consequence.

 In terms of bad consequences, I think the single 

biggest bad consequence of directing these prisoners to 

1983 rather than habeas is it's going to deprive them of 

the opportunity for meaningful relief in Ohio's courts. 

The Layne decision in the last -- decided just 2 years 

ago, three prisoners brought a declaratory judgment action 

about the way parole works in Ohio. They were successful 

and their case resulted in 3,000 prisoners receiving --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but you raise 

deprivation of the benefit they would get from the Ohio 

courts. If they wanted that benefit, they could have 

brought a 1983 action in State courts. State courts have

jurisdiction. So it's a little odd for you to say, oh, 

they're being deprived of a benefit when they're telling 

you by this very lawsuit they don't want it. 

MR. COLE: That's true, Your Honor. At the same 

time, this -- bringing this -- this case in 1983 in 

Federal court means that they're not going to be able to 

get injunctive relief on State grounds under the Pennhurst 

doctrine. So they are depriving themselves of a chance to 

get that type of meaningful relief that Ohio courts are 

offering and that courts in other States are offering.

 The other -- the other point I wanted to make is 

that with respect to Petitioner Johnson's argument, his 

understanding of sentence, that if it doesn't impact the 

sentence, it can't be in habeas, would mean that parole 

revocations can't be in habeas either. A parole -- parole 

-- when you're on parole, you're still serving part of 

your sentence, as he understands it, part of the initial 

term that the court has imposed upon you. Granted, you're 

not doing it in prison, but a parole revocation wouldn't 

impact your sentence. It would merely bring you back into 

prison to serve the remainder of your sentence rather than 

having you serve it on the street. So I think that 

understanding of sentence can't make sense for -- for 

habeas purposes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think sentence means custody.

Don't you think it means custody?

 MR. COLE: Well, but to the extent we're 

talking --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The custody you've been 

sentenced to?

 MR. COLE: But to the extent we're talking about 

duration of custody or duration of confinement, again, the 

claims here do have a -- success on the claims here would 

have a meaningful impact on the duration of confinement. 

This Court in Muhammad said -- I think this is probably 

the -- the closest quote on point -- challenges to 

particulars affecting the duration of confinement are the 

province of habeas corpus. 

This is a challenge to a particular, the parole 

procedures, that's affecting the duration of their 

confinement. Or at least that's their allegations, and 

that's what success on their claims is going to mean. And 

because of those durational consequences, as well as 

because of the consequences of success on the merits for 

previous State parole decisions, we believe that those 

claims are better routed to habeas than to 1983.

 If there are no further questions. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I had one further question. 

Are you asking us to change anything in Wolff against 

McDonnell, or can we follow that case?

 MR. COLE: I think we can follow that case as 

it's been reinterpreted in Heck. Wolff said that -- well, 

Heck said that Wolff was about challenges that would not 

-- and I believe the language is -- necessarily vitiate 

the underlying decision. So the way Heck understood Wolff 

was that the procedural challenges there, with regard to 

the prospective relief they were seeking, were not the 

type of relief that would necessarily vitiate any decision 

that had already been made. 

Here, by contrast, the claims that they're 

bringing, the ex post facto claims, if they're successful 

on the merits, would necessarily vitiate the decisions 

that have gone before. 

Thank you, Your Honors. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Cole.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 10:57 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
