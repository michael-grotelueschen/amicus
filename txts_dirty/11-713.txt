3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 next today in Case 11-713, Perry v. Perez, and the 

consolidated cases. 

6  Mr. Clement. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS 

9  MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  The judicial maps drawn here are truly 

12 remarkable. They reflect the reality that the district 

13 court below lost sight of first principles. The court 

14 repeatedly invoked the principle that these were only 

interim maps and not remedial maps, but that obscures 

16 the reality that a court has the authority to draw an 

17 election map, surely one of the most powerful judicial 

18 tools in the judicial arsenal, only if it is identifying 

19 specific statutory or constitutional violations or a 

substantial likelihood thereof. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Clement, section 5 

22 says you can't draw new maps unless they've been 

23 precleared. You can't put them into effect. 

24  MR. CLEMENT: But --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, the only thing that 

4

1 exists is old maps until you get the preclearance. 

2  I don't see how we can give deference to an 

3 enacted new map, if section 5 says don't give it effect 

4 until it's been precleared.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Sotomayor, 

6 obviously, section 5 is clear that the new map drawn by 

7 the Texas legislature, the new maps drawn by the Texas 

8 legislature, cannot take effect of their own force. But 

9 that doesn't answer the question of whether a judge, 

when having to impose a remedial map to address what all 

11 concede is a one-person, one-vote problem with the 

12 benchmark maps, can look to the new maps which also 

13 remedy that same one-person, one-vote problem, for 

14 guidance. And this Court in its --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you're asking for 

16 more than for guidance. You're asking for deference. 

17 You're saying they have to start with the new map even 

18 though that map hasn't been approved. 

19  MR. CLEMENT: That's right, Your Honor. We 

think they --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Instead of starting, as 

22 the court below did, with the old map which had been 

23 approved. 

24  MR. CLEMENT: Right. We are -- in fairness, 

we're asking for it to be used as the starting point for

1 drawing the new map, but that's because --

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Doesn't that turn
 

3 section 5 on its head?
 

4  MR. CLEMENT: No, I don't think so, Your
 

Honor, for a number of reasons. One is that the 

6 obligation to go to the preclearance court or to go to 

7 the Attorney General remains fully in place. So, the 

8 only question is, what is going to inform the district 

9 court in Texas's exercise of remedial authority to 

remedy the one-person, one-vote problem with the 

11 remedial plans -- with the benchmark plans, rather? 

12  Now, this Court from the very beginning of 

13 its reapportionment cases has emphasized the need to 

14 look for legislative guidance in order to inform the 

judicial exercise of solving that reapportionment 

16 problem. And the need to look to the new maps I think 

17 is most acute, of course, with the congressional maps 

18 because the benchmark is -- is a fine map, but it's a 

19 map for 32 seats. And Congress here -- the legislature 

of Texas has spoken as to how it would like to divide 

21 the new 36-seat allocation up. And it seems to be quite 

22 odd that the court would simply ignore that judgment 

23 when it could look to that as the starting point. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: It didn't -- it didn't 

ignore it. It took it into account along with other 

6

1 plans. My -- Mr. Clement, suppose the D.C. court that 

2 has exclusive authority over preclearance in 

3 mid-February denies preclearance. And suppose --

4 suppose we accept your position. You prevail in -- in 

this proceeding. And then the three-judge district 

6 court says this -- this plan -- these plans do not meet 

7 the section 5 requirement; we deny preclearance. What 

8 happens if we use the Texas plan that has not been 

9 precleared as the interim plan?

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, as a 

11 practical matter, I suppose at that point Appellees 

12 would go to the court in Texas and say you need to 

13 revise your interim maps once again. 

14  Now, I think, since the premise for the 

court drawing its interim maps is that time is of the 

16 essence, it can't wait any longer, the Texas court may 

17 deny that motion or it may grant that motion. I mean, I 

18 don't -- I don't really have a crystal ball to take that 

19 into account.

 But what I do think is particularly 

21 anomalous is let's suppose that the D.C. court does deny 

22 preclearance. At that point, it's common ground that 

23 the plan, the legislatively enacted plan, even though 

24 it's denied preclearance, would be something that the 

Texas court would have to defer to. That's basically

1 Upham. 

2  So, it's the oddity of the other side's 

3 position --

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't see how it's 

basically Upham. That was a plan -- there were two 

6 contiguous districts. There was a problem with them. 

7 The Attorney General said the rest of it was okay. Here 

8 the entire plan -- the plans are -- are opposed. 

9  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I mean 

it's true that the Justice Department does raise a 

11 purpose objection to the plans as a whole, but of course 

12 even that takes its force from the way particular 

13 districts are being drawn. It seems to me quite likely 

14 that -- you know, obviously, our position is that the 

D.C. court is most likely to grant preclearance. But if 

16 they were to deny it, it seems quite likely that they 

17 would deny it as to particular districts. And then 

18 Upham would make clear that you would give -- that the 

19 Texas court would give deference to the legislative 

plan. 

21  And the anomaly of the other side's position 

22 is you give less deference to a plan when preclearance 

23 is pending than you do when preclearance is denied. 

24  JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you a question 

about timing? Let's suppose that the district court in 

8

1 Washington moves expeditiously and issues a decision in 

2 mid-February. Are there insuperable problems with 

3 postponing the Texas primary so that the plan that is to 

4 be used can -- doesn't have to be formulated until after 

the district court in Washington has ruled? 

6  Texas has a very early primary. Some States 

7 have them for congressional races in -- in the fall, and 

8 the latest presidential primary I think is at the end of 

9 June. So, why can't this all be pushed back, and 

wouldn't that eliminate a lot of the problems that we 

11 are grappling with in this case? 

12  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Alito, two --

13 two answers: One is, as a practical matter, all of the 

14 affected, you know, entities in Texas have gotten 

together, and they've agreed on the ability to move the 

16 primary back to April, given -- on the assumption that a 

17 map could be in place by February 1st. 

18  Now, you know, the primary has been moved 

19 from March to April already. So, I can't tell you that 

it's impossible to move it again, but it's also quite, 

21 you know, in a sense -- I mean, the question becomes --

22 I mean, Texas has made its own determination that it 

23 wants to have a relatively early primary. That's not 

24 something it cocked up for this set of elections. It's 

had that in place since at least 1988. And so, the 

9

Official 

1 question is how much do you want to interfere with that 

2 judgment? 

3  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if we have a binary 

4 choice, if it's either the plan enacted by the Texas 

legislature or the plan that's already been drawn up by 

6 the court, yes, that could be presumably resolved rather 

7 quickly. But what if neither of those is fully 

8 acceptable? Then is it -- is it practicable to have the 

9 primary on the date that's been agreed on? And if not, 

then wouldn't -- would you just prefer to limit us to 

11 those two possibilities or would Texas entertain the 

12 possibility of moving the primary back? 

13  MR. CLEMENT: Well, look, Texas wants the 

14 Court to have the opportunity to get this right. We 

think the decision below is profoundly wrong. We think 

16 it's important for this Court to send a clear signal to 

17 the courts that would provide relief not just in this 

18 case but to future situations where this arose. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Just one more question.

 MR. CLEMENT: Sure. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Background question about 

22 preclearance. Assume that the court of appeals -- that 

23 the three-judge district court in Columbia in the 

24 preclearance proceeding finds some problems with two or 

three of the districts, say, in the congressional plan.

1 Does it just say we -- there are problems with these 

2 districts, we therefore deny preclearance; or does it 

3 then give guidance and say we would give preclearance if 

4 you made the following changes? Does it -- in other 

words, does it give you a road map? How do these 

6 decisions work? That's what I'm asking. 

7  MR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't think there's a 

8 road map for the extent to which they give a road map. 

9 I think there are two things that are crystal clear. 

One is that when the D.C. authority, be it the Attorney 

11 General or the court, denies preclearance, it denies 

12 preclearance. The plan is not precleared. There's no 

13 such thing as preclearance in part or partial 

14 preclearance. As the Justice Department puts it, it 

doesn't work like a line item veto. 

16  Now, that's not to say -- and here's the second 

17 point. That's not to say that the court doesn't provide 

18 reasoning for its decision, or the Attorney General. 

19 And that's why in Upham, for example, that the Court --

this Court knew that the objections were to two 

21 particular districts, even though the effect in Upham 

22 was to not preclear the whole plan. And it seems to me 

23 the mistake of the district court is it effectively 

24 treats the un-precleared plan as a nullity. And that's 

the exact word that Judge Johnson used in the lower 

11

Official 

1 court opinion in Upham. 

2  And this Court reversed because it said no, 

3 you don't ignore that, but on the other hand, what you 

4 do is you take into account the judgment of the Attorney 

General in that case; but other than that, you take the 

6 plan into account notwithstanding the fact that it 

7 hasn't been precleared. 

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: But we've said over and 

9 over, Mr. Clement, that it's the Attorney General and 

the district court in D.C. that have exclusive 

11 jurisdiction over this set of questions and that we 

12 don't want courts in other part of the country to try to 

13 mimic what those -- what that court and the Attorney 

14 General are supposed to do.

 And you're essentially asking for the 

16 district court in the State of Texas to try to predict 

17 what they're going to do and to mimic what they're going 

18 to do. And that's why Justice Alito suggests, well, 

19 look, if we've said that only the district court in D.C. 

and the Attorney General should do this, let's wait 

21 until they do it and go from there. 

22  MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kagan, here's 

23 why we're -- we're not asking the regional court to 

24 mimic the D.C. court's function. We're asking it to 

perform correctly the one -- one of the roles that this 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 Court has always made clear the regional court retains. 

2 And that's to provide temporary relief. 

3  If you look at this Court's decisions that 

4 essentially warn off a regional court from arrogating to 

itself the final preclearance decision -- I'm thinking, 

6 for example, of Connor v. Waller -- those same decisions 

7 say: But this is not with prejudice to your ability to 

8 provide temporary relief. 

9  Now, our position is quite simple. If we're 

in a situation where the regional court has to provide 

11 temporary relief, then it should apply the same 

12 standards that always apply everywhere to courts issuing 

13 temporary relief. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: But you're not taking into 

account the fact that, as Justice Sotomayor said, 

16 section 5 itself operates as an injunction. And it's an 

17 injunction against the use of an un-precleared plan. 

18  MR. CLEMENT: Justice Kagan, I think we are 

19 taking that into account. I mean -- and I think that's 

at the heart of what's going on here. You have to ask 

21 yourself the question: What is the remedy that the 

22 Texas court in this case was trying -- what is the 

23 violation, rather, that the Texas court was trying to 

24 remedy? The Appellees proceed and I think your question 

proceeds on the assumption as if the violation is a 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 section 5 violation. But that's not what motivated the 

2 court's opinion, and you can -- I mean, look at page 96 

3 of the Joint Appendix, where the court specifically 

4 says: Look, Texas has always been clear. They need to 

get preclearance. So, this is not about enjoining them 

6 from implementing the plan. 

7  The constitutional violation that's being 

8 remedied here and the only thing that gave the Texas 

9 court any authority is the one person, one vote 

violation with the old plans. And so, the --

11  JUSTICE BREYER: That's what they said 

12 they're doing. I mean, I count in the -- about eight 

13 times in the house plan, the State house plan, and 

14 several times in the senate plan where it's clear, and I 

think it's fairly clear in the U.S. House plan, they say 

16 things like: "The court began by considering the 

17 uncontested districts from the enacted plan that 

18 embraced neutral districting principles, although it 

19 wasn't required to give any deference." And you say 

they're wrong about that. "The court attempted to 

21 embrace as many of the uncontested districts as 

22 possible." 

23  So, after I got finished reading their 

24 opinions, I thought, well, there may be a difference 

between what you say and they say, but I'm not sure that 

14

1 there is a difference that's reflected in the maps. 

2  And so, it's now January 9th. We have to 

3 have something in effect by February 1st. They said 

4 that they're paying attention to what the legislature 

did. And when I looked at the maps, as far as I can 

6 tell, they include -- some more, some less, most in the 

7 State senate -- but they include a lot of the State's 

8 changes. 

9  So, what am I supposed to do? I mean, I 

can't tell whether you're right or wrong without looking 

11 district by district by district by district. What am I 

12 supposed to do on January 9th? 

13  MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think on January 9th, 

14 Justice Breyer, you should take another look at El Paso 

County. Because I think if you look at El Paso 

16 County --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: In which -- in which --

18  MR. CLEMENT: In either the congressional 

19 map or the house map. I think if you look at El Paso 

County, what you cannot conclude is that all ---

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What map is that? 

22  MR. CLEMENT: What's that? 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What district is that? 

24  MR. CLEMENT: Well, it depends. If we're 

looking at the congressional map, I believe it's

1 district 16 or 17. And that's -- those maps start on 

2 page 1. 

3  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. El Paso County in 

4 the original plan I guess was -- like number 16. I've 

got it in front of me. And they split it, and it was 

6 split somewhat differently or not. Okay. 

7  MR. CLEMENT: Well, I mean, I think you're 

8 understating it. I mean, on the benchmark plan --

9  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, right. It's a 

whole --

11  MR. CLEMENT: -- that was a straight line. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

13  MR. CLEMENT: On the enacted plan, it was a 

14 different straight line.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Correct. 

16  MR. CLEMENT: And in the court's plan --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: So -- all right. All 

18 right. Now, why was that wrong? Why is that wrong? 

19 Tell me why it's wrong for them to do that.

 MR. CLEMENT: I want to -- I want to say two 

21 reasons why it's wrong, but first I think that really 

22 does answer your premise, which is that all the court 

23 was doing was remedying one person, one vote. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, I didn't say that. 

I said, in their way of thinking, they are taking the

1 map into account. Now, to sit -- the enacted one. If I 

2 disagree with that, I can't disagree at the level of 

3 principle; I have to disagree at the level of particular 

4 districts. That's why I asked you the question. So, 

you point to district 16, and I say, very well, tell me 

6 what they did wrong and why? Because, remember, they 

7 are facing a challenge that's based on section 5, part 

8 purpose. 

9  And the district court there said, in the 

D.C., you don't survive -- I can't give you a summary 

11 judgment on that; purpose here may have been violated. 

12  All right. Now, you tell me what's wrong 

13 with district 16, which I guess is your strongest case. 

14 That would be helpful.

 MR. CLEMENT: No, what I'm -- I'm not saying 

16 it's my strongest case. I'm saying it's illustrative of 

17 the problem. Another thing that's illustrative of the 

18 problem --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what's was the 

problem? 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Tell me -- tell me what's 

22 the problem? 

23  MR. CLEMENT: The problem is that the court 

24 lost sight of what it was supposed to be doing. It was 

supposed to be --

4 we're trying to take into account the map. I'm just 

repeating myself.
 

6  I want to know what is wrong with the
 

7 drawing of district 16, what they did, given that
 

8 there's a section 5 challenge based on purpose?
 

9  MR. CLEMENT: And what's wrong with it is
 

because they neither started with the old benchmark plan 

11 and said we're going to solve a one person, one vote 

12 problem, nor did they start with the new legislative 

13 plan and say is. There some violation that allows us to 

14 change that plan? They instead, as they told you, said 

that they were on their own drawing an independent map. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. That's --

17 that's incomplete. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your 

19 -- finish your answer, please, if you can.

 MR. CLEMENT: What I was hoping to say is 

21 that they -- they told you they were drawing an 

22 independent map, and what they told you is that they 

23 thought that they were under an affirmative obligation 

24 not to defer to the legislative enactment because it 

hadn't been precleared. And the oddity of this -- I

1 mean, look, you're right. In certain places, they then

3  But the oddity of their position is their 

4 first premise, which is the one thing we can't do in 

drawing these maps, is look at that -- look at that 

6 un-precleared map. There's no explanation for why -- if 

7 that premise was right, why would it be even a good 

8 thing that they were pointing to the other map. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm not sure 

how I understand that, okay? As I looked at one of the 

11 El Paso maps, the enacted map created a antler-type 

12 district, a head and two unconnected antlers on top, 

13 nothing tying them together. 

14  The district court went back to the 

benchmark and said this is the benchmark district; now 

16 I'm going to draw the districts around it that fall 

17 naturally, trying to stay within neutral principles of 

18 not dividing up the city more than I have to. And it 

19 came out with another district.

 I don't understand what principle, what 

21 legal principle, the district court was violating that 

22 makes what it did with that particular county wrong. 

23 You're saying they should have given deference to an 

24 oddly shaped district that changed a prior benchmark 

that's been challenged as having been created

1 specifically to minimize the Latino vote. 

2  All of the challenges that relate to El Paso 

3 are very significant. The district court has already 

4 denied summary judgment on that. Tell me what legal 

principle they violated, other than the deference 

6 principle that you're relying upon? 

7  MR. CLEMENT: The basic principle they 

8 violated is they drew an interim order that they thought 

9 wasn't a remedial order without it being based on any 

finding of substantial likelihood of a violation. 

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's your second --

12  MR. CLEMENT: You may be right. You may be 

13 right. There may be a problem with those maps in El 

14 Paso. I don't think so, and I'd like to talk about 

that. 

16  But if the district court had said, you 

17 know, there's a problem with this because the two - the 

18 two antler -- the deer with two antlers, that violates 

19 -- that's a substantial likelihood of violating the 

Constitution. We're going to remedy that. If that's 

21 what they did, this would be a very different case. 

22  Now, I do want to talk about the deer with 

23 two antlers, because what that ignores is that in the 

24 benchmark plan, the deer had one antler and an antenna. 

And so, the district court -- the map the district court

1 drew doesn't look anything like the benchmark, and
 

2 actually the map that the legislature drew looks very
 

3 much like the benchmark.
 

4  And so, I think that just shows that what
 

was going on here by the district court was something 

6 very different from either remedying a one-person, 

7 one-vote problem with the benchmark or from correcting 

8 specific identified problems with the legislative map. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: I had thought, Mr. Clement, 

that -- that one of your objections was that in deciding 

11 whether they're using the benchmark or the -- the 

12 legislature's proposed new plan, whichever one they're 

13 using, they -- in drawing up their own plan, they 

14 assumed the validity of all of the challenges.

 Is -- is that not the case? 

16  MR. CLEMENT: Well, that is the case, Your 

17 Honor, and that is one of the many problems with the way 

18 that the court proceeded here. Because once you lose 

19 sight of the fact that, look, we only have remedial 

authority if we're remedying substantial likelihood of 

21 violations that are identifiable and particular, well, 

22 then what are you going to do? 

23  What this district court did, after he 

24 started where Justice Breyer suggested, is that the 

district court judges then said, look, we want to avoid

1 the challenges that are brought by the plaintiffs. And 

2 what they mean by "avoid" is they basically take all the 

3 allegations at face value and then redraw the district 

4 to avoid this.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: At face value. But you 

6 don't have any problem -- if I'm a district judge and I 

7 think there is a substantial likelihood that a 

8 particular challenge will succeed, you don't have any 

9 problem with my drawing an interim plan to avoid that 

likelihood. 

11  MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely no problem at 

12 all --

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you. 

14  MR. CLEMENT: -- Justice Kennedy. And the 

great thing about that is that gives the district court 

16 a familiar role to play applying familiar standards, and 

17 it gives this Court something to review. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the district court in 

19 that -- in that scenario is projecting what the D.C. 

court that has exclusive authority is going to do. And 

21 that's why I find your -- your position troublesome. 

22 You're asking one court to make its best guess at what 

23 another court is likely to do, and that other court has 

24 exclusive jurisdiction.

1 that, Justice Ginsburg, as follows? Which is, I had 

2 assumed that Justice Kennedy's question was not specific 

3 to section 5 and could just as well be a section 2 

4 problem --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Section 2. 

6  MR. CLEMENT: -- or an equal protection 

7 under the Constitution problem. And in this case, there 

8 is no problem. All the court is doing is making a 

9 substantial likelihood determination of an issue that 

it's ultimately going to confront. 

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: But haven't we also said 

12 that, with respect to section 2 and constitutional 

13 violations, that those allegations would be unripe in 

14 the -- prior to the district court or the Attorney 

General clearing a plan? 

16  MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely, Justice Kagan. 

17 But I think it's important to understand that to the 

18 extent that the district court in this remedial phase 

19 should take section 5 into account, it's just in 

considering whether or not the remedial plan is 

21 consistent with section 5 principles. And that's what 

22 the judges did in this case with respect to their own 

23 plan. So, we're not asking them to do something with 

24 section 5 that they otherwise wouldn't do.

 And, again, I think if you come back to the

Official 

1 particular question of what are they trying to remedy --

2 I mean, they're trying to remedy the one person, one 

3 vote problem. So, if that's what they're trying to 

4 remedy, why wouldn't they take into account the 

legislative policy judgments reflected in the
 

6 un-precleared plan if that's -- if that's the state
 

7 we're in, if that's the snapshot we're in.
 

8  I mean, keep in mind, this Court has
 

9 throughout --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, just because section 5 

11 says that there's no presumption of regularity attached 

12 to that plan and, indeed, that it's unlawful to put that 

13 plan into effect without the proper approvals. 

14  MR. CLEMENT: Two things, Justice Kagan: 

One, I would beg to differ that what section 5 says is 

16 that there's no presumption of regularity. And I think 

17 that's -- it's not just a quibble because I think if 

18 what section 5 says is that there's no presumption of 

19 regularity or no presumption of good faith, then section 

5 I think is closer to the constitutional edge than this 

21 Court said in Northwest Austin. I think all it says --

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: Section 5 says somebody has 

23 to clear it before it can go into effect. 

24  MR. CLEMENT: Absolutely. But I don't think 

that means that the assumption is that the legislature

Official 

1 didn't act in good faith in enacting the provision. And 

2 that brings me to my second point --

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: Nobody said the opposite. 

4 The question just is, does somebody have to clear it? 

Here, it wasn't cleared. 

6  MR. CLEMENT: Okay. I agree, but then the 

7 question is, if there's not a presumption of bad faith, 

8 then why wouldn't the court take that legislative 

9 judgment into account in drawing its remedy for the one 

person, one vote violation in the remedial district? 

11  If I could add my second point, which is the 

12 other thing to keep in mind is the preclearance 

13 obligation is not driven by congressional judgment that 

14 these covered jurisdictions are particularly bad at 

remedying one person, one vote problems. 

16  Obviously, section 5 is driven by concerns 

17 about racial discrimination. So, in that sense, it's 

18 particularly odd, given that what's at issue here is a 

19 remedy for a one person, one vote problem, that you 

would assume that you're not going to take into account 

21 the legislature's judgment as reflected in an 

22 un-precleared plan. 

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: No, I don't think that 

24 that's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I think

25

Official 

1 there -- I see two different problems, and I'm not quite 

2 sure how to come out. One, you cannot assume that the 

3 legislature's plan should be treated as if it were 

4 precleared. The district court in Texas cannot assume 

or presume what the district court here in D.C. is going 

6 to do. 

7  But, on the other hand, it can't presume it 

8 the other way. In other words, it can't draw its 

9 interim plan assuming that there are going to be these 

section 5 violations because that's presuming what the 

11 court's going to do the other way. 

12  So, how do we decide between those two --

13 you have two wrong choices. How do we end up? 

14  MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think you try to split 

the difference by trying to apply the preliminary 

16 injunction standards. And I think if you do that, then 

17 what you're going to do is that you're going to ensure 

18 that the remedy that the district court draws for -- as 

19 an interim matter for the one person, one vote problem, 

which is not the same thing as preclearance, that remedy 

21 is both consistent with the legislative policy judgments 

22 but also with section 2, with the Equal Protection 

23 Clause. 

24  And I suppose if this Court wants to, it can 

say that for purposes of interim temporary relief, the 

26

Official 

1 Court can look at section 5 directly. I would think the 

2 better answer is, no, you just focus it on section 2, 

3 the Equal Protection Clause, and then you ensure that 

4 the judicial plan is consistent with section 5 

principles, because that's the test that the Court's 

6 going to apply in any event. 

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you -- can you tell me 

8 with reference to the two districts, other than the 

9 senate district, congressional and State house 

districts, did Judge Smith defer or use the -- the Texas 

11 legislature's 2011 plan as a benchmark to some extent? 

12  MR. CLEMENT: I -- I don't think Judge 

13 Smith -- if I can answer your question, I think this 

14 does: I don't think Judge Smith did this the way that 

we think he should or focused on the benchmark. If you 

16 look at the congressional plan, what he did is he just 

17 basically picked one of the proposals that was a 

18 bipartisan proposal, so-called C216. 

19  With respect to the house plan, I think he 

got it -- the Texas house plan -- I think he got it 

21 closer to right. But I don't think he applied the right 

22 standard. And I would ask you to look at Joint Appendix 

23 193, and particularly his consideration of house 

24 district 33, because there what Judge Smith did is said, 

well, you know, there's these allegations, and I find

4  That doesn't seem quite right. I mean, if 

the State really does have persuasive responses, that 

6 ought to be enough to not redraw the district. 

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, you would fault his 

8 solution for giving insufficient deference to the State 

9 of Texas 2011 plan?

 MR. CLEMENT: That's right, but it's -- it's 

11 certainly a fair improvement over what the district

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you this: 

Suppose that this -- all the facts are the same except 

6 that this is in a State that is not subject to section 

7  5.  

8  Would there be a problem in your view with 

9 what the district -- with what the district court did, 

with Judge Smith -- with what Judge Smith did? 

11  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, with Judge -- with 

12 what Judge Smith did, I guess in that context, 

13 Justice Kennedy, there wouldn't be a section 5 issue at 

14 all.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. 

16  MR. SRINIVASAN: And all you'd be dealing 

17 with is section 2 or the Equal Protection Clause. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And then we could -- then 

19 there would be no problem with using Texas as a 

benchmark, the Texas 2011 as benchmark, as a starting 

21 point? 

22  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I --

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: As a starting point? 

24  MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. Well, I guess what I 

would say is this, that in the malapportionment context

1 what this Court typically has said the district court
 

2 should do is to start with a plan that's already in
 

3 effect and then modify it according to neutral
 

4 districting principles to remove the malapportionment
 

issue. And that's --

6  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what are neutral 

7 districting principles? Anybody who draws a map faces 

8 at the outset certain legal constraints, constitutional 

9 constraints, restrictions that are imposed by the Voting 

Rights Act, maybe some State law restrictions to the 

11 extent they're not inconsistent with Federal law. Once 

12 you've gotten beyond that point, all you have left is 

13 districting policy. 

14  They're policy choices, and there are many 

factors that can be taken into account in drawing a map: 

16 how compact you want the districts to be, to what extent 

17 are you going to respect zones of common economic 

18 interests, to what extent are you going to try to 

19 preserve old districts, what about incumbents, what 

about party registration? Are you going to try to have 

21 balance or are you going to try to favor one party or 

22 the other? That's all -- those are all questions of 

23 policy. 

24  And the question is, whose -- who makes 

those policy decisions? Are they going to be the policy 

30

25

1 decisions that were made by the legislature, or are they 

2 going to be the policy decisions made by the district 

3 court? And to say they're going to apply neutral 

4 districting principles is a subterfuge. There is no 

such thing. 

6  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I guess I would 

7 disagree with you, Justice Alito. I want to make two 

8 preliminary observations on what a district court is 

9 supposed to do in this regard, and then I'll try to walk 

through the principles that should guide this inquiry. 

11  The first preliminary observation is what a 

12 district court is not supposed to do, and what a 

13 district court is not supposed to do is to take the 

14 un-precleared plan as a given, because section 5 

forecloses it. 

16  Now, what's a district court supposed to do? 

17 It's not at sea, contrary to the underpinning of some of 

18 the arguments made today, because the district court 

19 starts with the last legally enforceable plan, which 

after all is the last manifestation of State policies 

21 and priorities. So, you have that as a starting point. 

22 And then it has to modify that plan, of course, to deal 

23 with malapportionment issues and to comply with section 

24 2 and section 5 --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't want to

Official 

1 interrupt you too much, but even if you do that, even if 

2 you start with the old plan and then you modify it to 

3 the extent necessary to comply with the Constitution and 

4 statutes, there are still -- I'm sure our computer could 

shoot out dozens and dozens of possible maps, and 

6 somebody has to choose among them. Now, what criteria 

7 does a district judge -- does a district court use in 

8 making that choice? 

9  MR. SRINIVASAN: There is discretion in the 

inquiry, Justice Alito. I'm not going to -- I'm not 

11 going to disagree with that. What it looks to is the 

12 districting criteria that had been applied by this 

13 jurisdiction in the past. And, for example, in this 

14 case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not just discretion. 

16 It's political discretion. That's what's troublesome 

17 about it. And you -- it seems to me the Government 

18 makes -- takes an absolutist approach to the proposition 

19 that you cannot use an un-precleared plan for any 

purpose. All the law says is that you cannot apply a 

21 precleared plan. The plan being applied here is not the 

22 Texas legislature's plan; it's the plan -- a remedial 

23 plan adopted by Federal judges. 

24  And to say that they cannot use in drawing 

up that plan the legislature's last political decisions

neither one of them acts in time, and it's too late?
 

6 It's too late to have any -- any primaries anymore.
 

7 What -- what would happen?
 

8  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I guess --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: What would happen? You
 

can't use the old plan. You have this absolute rule 

11 against using the new plan. What happens? You 

12 disenfranchise every voter in Texas --

13  MR. SRINIVASAN: No, I don't think you could 

14 do that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- because there may be 

16 some voters in Texas, may be, some who will be 

17 prejudiced by using the current plan? I suggest in that 

18 situation there's nothing to do but use the Texas plan. 

19  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't -- not in the 

context of section 5, Your Honor. It's -- that's one 

21 option, but the other option would be to use a 

22 malapportioned plan, which this Court has suggested 

23 would be something the courts could do. Now, that's not 

24 a preferred option, to be sure.

 But we're not in that situation here,

1 because what you have is interim maps that have been 

2 developed. We're not in the kind of emergency situation 

3 that you're positing. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: You acknowledge that there 

are some situations in which you can use the very plan 

6 that the Texas legislature adopted, even though it's not 

7 been precleared? 

8  MR. SRINIVASAN: Only if there's no time for 

9 a district court to adopt a different plan.  But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, it's no longer an 

11 absolute rule. So, the question is whether this is 

12 another reasonable exception to a non-absolute rule. 

13  MR. SRINIVASAN: There is an emergency 

14 exception, as there is with all sorts of legal rules. 

But that's so far as we would go. 

16  Now, I would like to address the proposition 

17 that what the Court would be doing here under Texas's 

18 view is just a standard application of substantial 

19 likelihood of success principles, because it's not. 

It's decidedly different from standard operation of 

21 substantial likelihood of success principles in three 

22 fundamental respects. 

23  The first goes to the burden, 

24 Justice Kennedy, and I think you alluded to this in your 

question. The burden in a preliminary injunction

1 context stays with the same party at the preliminary 

2 injunction stage as at the merits stage. And so, when 

3 in a preliminary injunction context the court is asking 

4 has there been a substantial likelihood of success on 

the merits, the same party has to make that showing as 

6 has to make that showing at the merits stage. 

7  Here Texas would turn that upside down, 

8 because at the merits stage, which is the preclearance 

9 proceeding --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, would it be okay if we 

11 just said, well, Texas has to make the showing? 

12  MR. SRINIVASAN: That would certainly be 

13 better. I think that would improve things quite a bit. 

14 But that's not what Texas -- the approach that Texas 

proposes today. 

16  But it's different in two other respects 

17 from a standard preliminary injunction context as well. 

18 And one is what Justice Ginsburg alluded to, which is 

19 here you don't have a situation in which the same court 

that's going to forecast its ultimate adjudication of 

21 the merits is also deciding what it's going to do at the 

22 preliminary injunction stage. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's exactly 

24 right, but you see it only on one side of the problem. 

You say, well, you can't treat it as if it's been

2  MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- because that 

4 would be prejudging what the court in D.C. is going to 

do. But you have no trouble with them saying --

6 assuming that there are going to be these section 5
 

7 violations and drawing additional majority-minority
 

8 districts, which is just assuming on the other -- the
 

9 other way what the court here in D.C. is going to do.


 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well --

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't know how you 

12 -- you lean one way and say, well, it's horrible, you 

13 can't use it because it hasn't been precleared; but it's 

14 all right in drawing the interim plan to treat it as 

there -- as if preclearance has been denied. 

16  MR. SRINIVASAN: No, I don't -- I don't know 

17 about that, because I think what a district court is 

18 supposed to do when preclearance is pending is not 

19 accept all the challenges. What it's supposed to do is 

to apply traditional districting criteria to the 

21 benchmark. So, I guess --

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, do you contest the view 

23 that this district court did essentially accept the 

24 challenges, did sort of say, well, look, there are these 

challenges; so, we have to make sure that we don't do

opinions here are not a model of clarity. In some 

6 respects, they seem to outline the right inquiry. If 

7 you look at Joint Appendix 137 to 138, I think what the 

8 district court said it was doing was starting with the 

9 status quo, which is the benchmark, and then modifying 

it.

12 and if you look at Joint Appendix 146 --

13  MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- to 147, it looks 

the exact opposite. It looks like they're drawing

17 because they have anticipated how they think the 

18 district court in D.C. is going to come out. 

19  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that's -- that's 

right, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think we point to that

1 that -- driving it. That's the problem with this
 

2 litigation, it seems to me.
 

3  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think section 5
 

4 can't help but drive --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And section 5 applies only 

6 to -- to some States and not others. Texas is at a 

7 tremendous disadvantage here in defending the section 2 

8 suit and in drawing -- and in having -- and the 

9 judiciary is at a disadvantage in -- in framing a remedy 

for a likely -- a likely section 2 violation in some of 

11 the districts. 

12  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, of course, Your 

13 Honor, Texas is in a different position precisely 

14 because it's a covered jurisdiction. And when you have 

a section 5 case, section 5 can't help but take 

16 precedence in some respects, precisely because a 

17 proposed change can't go into effect unless and until 

18 the covered jurisdiction shows that it's 

19 nondiscriminatory in purpose and effect. But I do think 

it's important --

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I wonder if it 

22 should take precedence in a section 2 suit. That's all 

23 this court -- this is the primary obligation of the 

24 Texas district court, is to address section 2 

violations.

1  MR. SRINIVASAN: That -- that may be, Your 

2 Honor, but I think then if -- if it can't address the 

3 section 5 issue at all, then the one thing that 

4 shouldn't happen is that the section 2 court gives 

effect to the un-precleared plan, because that's 

6 something that the D.C. district court is supposed to 

7 do. 

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it's not giving 

9 effect to the uncleared plan. It's giving effect to a 

legislative judgment as to what is workable for all the 

11 factors and criteria that Justice Alito referred to, 

12 county lines, et cetera. 

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We -- we'll let you 

14 go on for a little longer. We may have a few more 

questions. 

16  MR. SRINIVASAN: Okay. Thank you, 

17 Mr. Chief Justice. I appreciate that. 

18  I guess what I would say, Justice Kennedy, 

19 is, if you use the un-precleared plan as the starting 

point, which is what Texas proposes, you are giving 

21 effect to that, notwithstanding the preclearance 

22 requirement of section 5. And with a covered 

23 jurisdiction, that's something that section 5 doesn't 

24 allow.

 Now, I do think it's important to consider

1 Texas's preclearance submission in the context of the 

2 other statewide preclearance submissions that have been 

3 submitted in this election cycle. If you look at the 

4 Government's brief at pages 1a to 3a, I think what that 

bears out is that there's not a fundamental problem with 

6 section 5 or the way section 5 operates. The problem, 

7 insofar as it -- as it exists, is with respect to the 

8 particular submissions that Texas has made, because 

9 there were 20 submissions of statewide plans for 

administrative preclearance. In all 20 cases, the 

11 Attorney General precleared them. In 19 of the 

12 20 cases, the Attorney General precleared it within the 

13 initial 60-day window. Now --

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I have --

your position -- I understand you're straddling a 

16 position. That's why you're sitting in the back rather 

17 than the front row between the two parties. But it's a 

18 little unsatisfying because what you say we should do 

19 when we are all under the gun of very strict time 

limitations is we should send it back to the district 

21 court so it can give a greater explanation of what it's 

22 done. 

23  Isn't that going to be very wasteful? I 

24 mean, it's kind of an odd order from this Court to send 

to a district court saying, you know, tell us more.

1  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I don't know that it 

2 is, Your Honor, and I have two -- two responses in that 

3 respect. 

4  First -- and this goes to a question that 

Justice Alito asked earlier. What is this Court 

6 supposed to do in this situation? And I think one thing 

7 that could absolutely happen is if there were a remand, 

8 the D.C. district court could complete its preclearance 

9 proceeding, which would be very illuminating for the 

what the Texas district court is supposed to do. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: Do you have an idea of 

12 when? 

13  MR. SRINIVASAN. And by way of guidance on 

14 that, what I would --

JUSTICE BREYER: Do you have -- what is that 

16 based on? 

17  MR. SRINIVASAN: What I would say is this: 

18 The D.C. district court has scheduled trial to begin on 

19 January 17th. It's supposed to last 8 days. Closing 

argument is on February 3rd. If you look at what 

21 happened at the summary judgment stage, Justice Breyer, 

22 they had summary judgment arguments on one day; 6 

23 days later, they --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I read -- I read -- I 

read the opinion and what she said on the phone and so

1 forth. 

2  MR. SRINIVASAN: No, not that. 

3  JUSTICE BREYER: It seems to me that it's a 

4 complicated case. Let's suppose you're completely right 

on your time schedule. Then they'll decide something. 

6 How could any human being redraw maps in 5 days or 10 

7 days where you'll have different -- six different 

8 positions? I mean, I think it's impossible. How can 

9 you -- I don't see how you could do it.

 MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, of course, if 

11 preclearance is granted, we -- we won't have an issue 

12 with drawing maps. 

13  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I think there's -- it 

14 seemed to me from reading it, I -- I didn't think that 

the judge there is ready to grant preclearance. 

16  MR. SRINIVASAN: And we --

17  JUSTICE BREYER: But the other thing in 

18 sending it back, I read the brief, and then I read the 

19 opinions. I don't think I have -- I'm not being too 

generous to the opinions, but I thought what they were 

21 saying throughout is we didn't try to draw extra 

22 coalition or extra opportunity districts; they emerged. 

23 They say "emerged" about seven times. They emerged as 

24 we tried to apply equal vote principles. And it's 

hardly surprising that it would, considering that the

3  So, they didn't seem to me -- now, why do 

4 you want us to send it back to get more explanation when 

that seems to be the explanation, and to me at first 

6 blush, it seems like a perfectly good explanation. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe a brief 

8 answer. Thank you. 

9  MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes. Sure. I think it's 

if -- insofar as the coalition districts and ability-to 

11 districts emerge from natural growth, there's nothing 

12 suspect about them. The one example I point to is 

13 district 33. If you look at Joint Appendix, pages 146 

14 to 147, it's not clear what the -- what the district 

court was doing in that regard.

 MR. GARZA: Mr. Chief Judge, and may it 

21 please the Court: 

22  There seems to be general consensus on at 

23 least three points that we've talked about today. 

24 First, that the un-precleared plan cannot take effect.

basis. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Exclude me from the second. 

7 I'm not sure that -- that I've gone along on that, as 

8 you phrased it. The way you phrase it, you say they 

9 cannot even make the kind of preliminary inquiry that --

that your friend suggests. 

11  MR. GARZA: I think we're dealing with a 

12 matter of semantics, Your Honor, because the question 

13 is, did the court give the -- the State's plan 

14 deference? But it itself said that it began, as it 

should, as it has been directed by this Court, with the 

16 historical or benchmark configurations and then 

17 respected the State's plan. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: But you know what I don't 

19 understand about your briefs, Mr. Garza, is if the State 

can't -- if the plan has not been precleared, you should 

21 be saying the State can't look at the plan. But on the 

22 one hand, you're saying, well, isn't it great because 

23 the court did look at the plan, and on the one hand --

24 on the other hand you're saying the court can't look at 

the plan. So, which is it? Because there's a real

1 tension. On one page, you say isn't it great the court 

2 looked at the Texas plan. And then you say the court 

3 can't look at the Texas plan. 

4  MR. GARZA: We don't say that the court 

can't look at the Texas plan. What we say is that the 

6 -- the court can't implement the Texas plan, and it 

7 certainly can't implement the Texas plan if there is any 

8 suspect of discrimination. And what it did was exactly 

9 the right measure.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Then you're saying the 

11 court should look at the merits. 

12  MR. GARZA: I think that the court did the 

13 appropriate thing by looking at the -- at those maps. 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No. Let -- let's go to 

-- something Justice Scalia asked was what does a court 

16 do with frivolous claims? Does it assume under your 

17 theory that those frivolous claims are valid? And if 

18 you say no, it shouldn't assume that, then what level of 

19 inquiry should the court engage in before it accepts or 

deviates from the enacted plan? 

21  MR. GARZA: I think that the court should 

22 look at -- first of all, should not start with the 

23 State's plan. It should look at where there have been 

24 objections made. And the role of the district court in 

the District of Columbia is where the question of

1 whether there are frivolous claims have been made. And 

2 there have been no motions to dismiss any of the claims 

3 in Washington, D.C., based on frivolity. 

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, the Texas court 

cannot -- should automatically accept all -- that every 

6 district that a challenge has been raised in the D.C. 

7 circuit court is --

8  MR. GARZA: It should --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- court is okay?

 MR. GARZA: It should not accept any of the 

11 districts that have been challenged. But I think the 

12 difference in terms of --

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. I'm 

14 not -- I didn't --

MR. GARZA: -- is it assuming a violation --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't mean to 

17 interrupt, but I didn't follow that. So long as a 

18 district has been challenged in D.C., the court in Texas 

19 should not accept it?

 MR. GARZA: It shouldn't make a 

21 determination either way, and it didn't, because in 

22 those districts, it didn't adopt the plans that were put 

23 forward by the plaintiffs or the challengers in 

24 Washington, D.C.; it looked at the benchmark plan as a 

starting point.

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But could it -- could it 

2 look at the district and say, well, it respects county 

3 lines; it follows a river; it's got urban and rural. 

4 Could it look at it for that reason?

 MR. GARZA: What it --

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And rely on the 

7 legislative judgment as making a sound judgment that the 

8 river runs through here, and the county line is there 

9 and so forth? That's -- that's what seems to me the 

difficulty with saying, oh, you can't look at the plan. 

11  MR. GARZA: I think the problem with that, 

12 Your Honor, is that then it would be assuming that the 

13 State is correct, that it doesn't violate section 5. 

14 That is -- that is an inquiry that's reserved to the 

district court in the District of Columbia. And --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's right, 

17 but -- but it goes the other way when you say they can't 

18 approve something that's been challenged. Aren't you 

19 assuming that the plaintiffs are right?

 MR. GARZA: No. 

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And that's an 

22 inquiry that belongs to the district court in D.C. 

23  MR. GARZA: No, because what the court did 

24 is it didn't accept as a remedy what the plaintiffs 

proposed there. It reverted to State policy, which is

1 what it's directed to do by this Court. It -- it went 

2 back to State policy, and it looked at the benchmark 

3 plan, and it started with the benchmark plan. Even with 

4 the congressional plan, where there are four new 

districts, and there is no comparable district in the 

6 benchmark, it looked to the legislatively enacted plan 

7 to determine where it would place those districts. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: But that is not the current 

9 State policy. The benchmark plan is gone. It's old. 

The Texas legislature now has a different policy, and 

11 that, you say, should be ignored. 

12  MR. GARZA: That policy cannot be deferred 

13 to. It is incorporated in the court's plan by -- in the 

14 manner in which it did review the plans. That is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, what's -- there's a 

16 presumption of its invalidity. You can't presume it 

17 valid, but you can presume it invalid. 

18  MR. GARZA: Either way. And, in fact, what 

19 the court did is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, not either way. 

21 You're presuming it invalid. 

22  MR. GARZA: It -- you -- you're not 

23 presuming it is invalid. You're -- you're suggesting

2 that tightrope is you go to what the State policy was 

3 before the enacted plan. 

4  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let's say -- let's say 

a legislature says we have a new policy, and that is 

6 that once we've satisfied our constitutional obligations 

7 and our obligations under the Voting Rights Act, the 

8 only thing we're going to do is try to draw the 

9 districts that are the most compact possible, 

compactness over everything else. 

11  They draw up a plan that embodies that 

12 policy, and it's challenged under section 5. Now, can 

13 the district court just say, well, that's -- the State's 

14 policy is compactness over everything else, but we don't 

agree with that, because we have other neutral 

16 principles that advance the interest of the collective 

17 public good, which is the term that this -- the words 

18 that this court used. Can they do that? 

19  MR. GARZA: I don't believe they can, and 

this court didn't. The court, in fact --

21  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if they can't do that, 

22 then you're saying that they are constrained by State 

23 policy, except to the extent the Constitution or the 

24 Voting Rights Act requires otherwise.

1 Voting Rights Act is section 5, and in those areas and 

2 in those districts where there have been challenges --

3 and by the way the district court has -- in the District 

4 of Columbia has determined that those challenges are 

substantial because they've denied preclearance, and, in 

6 fact, they've said that Texas has not disputed --

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: They denied summary 

8 judgment. They didn't deny preclearance. 

9  MR. GARZA: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They denied summary 

11 judgment. 

12  MR. GARZA: They denied summary judgment, 

13 but they went even further. They -- they said Texas has 

14 not disputed many of the intervenors' specific 

allegations of discriminatory intent. So, it's -- it's 

16 -- and under the summary judgment standard, they have to 

17 find that the challenges that are being made are 

18 substantial. 

19  The district court in Texas was not free to 

incorporate discriminatory districts in its interim 

21 plan, and it didn't. But it first went to the State's 

22 plan, the benchmark plan, to begin its process on how it 

23 was drawing those districts. 

24  And there's a good reason why Texas is 

covered under the Voting Rights Act. As this Court

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The 

constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act isn't at 

6 issue here, right? 

7  MR. GARZA: That's not. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Maybe you 

9 could turn for a moment to the issue that I see on Joint 

Appendix 146 and 147. They don't say a minority 

11 coalition opportunity district just happened to emerge. 

12 It said that district 33 was drawn as a minority 

13 coalition opportunity district. And we've never held 

14 that it is appropriate or even permissible to draw a 

district where you're putting in together two 

16 minorities, two different minority groups. And it seems 

17 to me that that raises all sorts of different concerns. 

18  It's one thing under the Voting Rights Act 

19 to say that this group votes as a bloc and has been 

discriminated against in its ability to elect 

21 representatives of its choice. It's another thing to 

22 say that two different minority groups are put together 

23 because they share some particular view so that one 

24 candidate is going to be each of theirs candidate --

candidates of choice. That goes quite a step further

 MR. GARZA: I think -- I think that the
 

6 statement that the court made is a correct statement.
 

7 It did create a coalition district in Dallas. But
 

8 that's not describing how it reached that -- that
 

9 district.


 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, it is. It 

11 says --

12  MR. GARZA: Where it describes how it 

13 reached that district is in a number of other places; 

14 however, as discussed above, the court has not 

intentionally created any minority districts. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: New district 33 was 

17 drawn as a minority coalition opportunity district. I 

18 don't see how that can be read any way other than 

19 saying -- saying when we sat down and drew it, we drew 

this one as a minority coalition opportunity district. 

21  MR. GARZA: Of course, it can be read 

22 differently than Your Honor's interpretation of this, 

23 because the court has said over and over again we did 

24 not attempt to create coalition districts; we did not 

attempt to draw minority majority --

9 have created a minority opportunity --

18 area." All right?

6 here. 

7  MR. GARZA: Precisely. And there's no 

8 independent evidence that this was a racial gerrymander. 

9 What do courts look at for evidence of racial 

gerrymanders? Split-voting precincts where you go out 

11 and carve and bring in minority voters. This district 

12 maintains voting precincts intact. It is entirely

State --

followed precinct lines and everything else. Why would

One is --

25

Official 

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, the court just made it 

2 up? 

3  MR. GARZA: No. There are two reasons why 

4 the court saw maintaining voting precincts as important. 

One is because that is what it's been directed by this 

6 Court in Bush v. Vera. In Bush v. Vera, the Court said 

7 we have an interim election or a -- or an impending 

8 election, and it's important for elections 

9 administrators in -- in order to be able to -- to 

implement without -- without interference a legitimate 

11 election process, to have whole precincts because whole 

12 precincts makes a big difference in terms of how the 

13 election is -- is administrated. 

14  The second reason is that this court didn't 

adopt this plan without any inquiry into the standards 

16 and proposals from the parties. It was very deliberate. 

17 It was very cautious, and it was very open. We had 3 

18 days of hearings on what these plans should look like 

19 and what the standards ought to be, including testimony 

from elections administrators and from the Texas 

21 Secretary of State. 

22  And in every instance, those administrators 

23 and that representative from the Secretary of State said 

24 the most important thing that the court should consider, 

if it's going to order us to start conducting elections

2 because that is the most cumbersome part. 

3  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if Texas says we don't 

4 care about maintaining voting precincts; this is -- this 

is a matter of -- of administrative burden and expense, 

6 and we're willing to bear that, so disregard that, the 

7 district court can say, well, we think -- we disagree 

8 with you; in order to make it more convenient to hold 

9 the election and less expensive for Texas, we're going 

to respect voting districts. They can do that? 

11  MR. GARZA: The State didn't do that in this 

12 instance, number one. 

13  JUSTICE ALITO: But could they do that? 

14  MR. GARZA: And --

JUSTICE ALITO: Could the district court do 

16 that? That's my question. 

17  MR. GARZA: It -- yes, I think they could 

18 because there's still the authority of this Court in 

19 Bush v. Vera that directs courts, in drawing interim 

plans for impending elections, to -- to be cautious 

21 about that, number one. And, number two, if in fact in 

22 order to get an appropriate map, you must split a number 

23 of precincts, which means then that you can't conduct 

24 the election on April 3rd, we still have time. As -- as 

the Government's attorney indicated, the -- there are

1 States that conduct primaries as late as June 26th. The 

2 drop-dead deadline is not April 3rd; it's November 6th. 

3  So, if this Court disagrees with our 

4 position and is determined to send this back to the 

district court, then it should consider this: The 

6 district court in the District of Columbia is about 

7 30 days away from rendering a complete decision in the 

8 section 5 case. That would place the court in Texas in 

9 exactly the Upham circumstance. In that circumstance --

and the court is poised to move. It can move with all 

11 due diligence. It had 2 weeks of trial in which it 

12 heard testimony on the plaintiffs' claims. It's -- it 

13 is -- it is ready. 

14  Once the district court in the District of 

Columbia tells us these are the problems with the 

16 State's plan, the court in Texas is primed to make its 

17 decision on the plaintiffs' claims under section 2 and 

18 the Constitution. In that circumstance --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Garza, what's the 

real drop-dead date? It's not November 6th because 

21 that's the day of the general election. What's the 

22 latest election -- primary election that any State has? 

23 June 26th? 

24  MR. GARZA: June 26th, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So, working

1 backwards, what's the last --

2  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's for
 

3 presidential primaries, isn't it? I don't want to
 

4 interrupt, but isn't that the date of the last
 

presidential primary rather than congressional? 

6  MR. GARZA: That's correct. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes. 

8  MR. GARZA: So, Utah is the last -- is the 

9 State with the last primary in which it conducts both 

the State's primary and the presidential. There are in 

11 -- in fact, States that conduct primaries as late as 

12 September that have no presidential primary at all. 

13  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, how many days before 

14 that election do -- does the voting mechanism or 

apparatus need to set up the voting booths, et cetera? 

16  MR. GARZA: The -- the critical date is 

17 45 days from the election in order to ensure -- sending 

18 out a ballot to overseas voters, including the military. 

19 So, if you -- if you go back 45 days and then you give 

the jurisdiction sufficient time to develop a ballot, 

21 because you need a ballot to send to the -- to the 

22 soldiers, then that's about what they've -- what the 

23 testimony was, is that takes about 90 days, I believe, 

24 is what they testified. So, 45 days plus 90 days, and 

that's the drop-dead deadline.

6  MR. GARZA: You could develop a plan by the 

7 end of March. And we could conduct an election in June, 

8 in late June. 

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: And when do you expect the 

D.C. court to finish? 

11  MR. GARZA: I would expect it to finish 

12 by -- within 30 days of today because we have closing 

13 arguments on -- on the 3rd of February, and if the court 

14 has -- will act with the sort of diligence that it did 

on summary judgment, which was a complicated record and 

16 a large record -- 6 days later, it made its 

17 determination. It didn't issue its memorandum opinion, 

18 but it gave us something that we could run with.

it's very complicated. 

6  MR. GARZA: Yes. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so, that's why I'm --

trial will end on February 3rd? 

11  MR. GARZA: That will be closing arguments. 

12 Yes, Your Honor. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there anything in the

22  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. 

23  MR. GARZA: Well, I believe that the -- that

substantial claims with regard to retrogression and

1 intentional discrimination. And, of course, intentional 

2 discrimination --

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: The second -- the second 

4 being section 2 violations as well.

 MR. GARZA: Intentional discrimination is a 

6 component of section 2. Yes, Your Honor. 

7  And it -- and I think it's important to note 

8 that Judge Smith in Texas used, in a manner of speaking, 

9 the preliminary injunction standard that's being 

advocated by the State, and they would not be able to 

11 meet that standard because, generally, Judge Smith 

12 determined that the plaintiffs had presented colorable 

13 claims of statutory or constitutional infirmity, ruled 

14 that the plan was an extreme gerrymander, ruled that 

elimination of district 149 presented section 5 

16 problems, ruled that the legislature dismantled a 

17 minority district in Nueces County that presented 

18 section 5 --

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you have substantive 

objections to the plans suggested by Judge Smith in the 

21 house and congressional districts? 

22  MR. GARZA: Yes, Your Honor. We believe 

23 that there are section 5 claims with regard to Harris 

24 County. Judge Smith addressed the constitutional --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Oh -- no, do you have some

1 section 2 objections? Well, that doesn't quite work. 

2 You have to talk about retrogression, I suppose. 

3  MR. GARZA: Right. And in -- in district --

4 in Harris County, the court did equalize population per 

the failure of the State to justify the sorts of 

6 deviations that are contained in that district but 

7 didn't provide, in our opinion, additional remedies. 

8  But Judge Smith's proposed plan for the 

9 State house is in fact very similar to the plan that was 

proposed by the majority. It -- it differs by only one 

11 minority district. That is, one additional minority 

12 district is contained in the interim plan than is 

13 contained in Judge Smith's plan. 

14  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Garza, what would you 

think of a system in which the court could start with 

16 the Texas plan and say -- the new Texas plan and say 

17 anything that's consistent with statutes and the 

18 Constitution can go forward, but it's Texas that has to 

19 show that consistency? So, flipping the burden of proof 

in the way that Mr. Srinivasan was suggesting? In a way 

21 that makes it more consistent --

22  MR. GARZA: Right. Right. 

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- with section 5's burden. 

24  MR. GARZA: Well, I -- I think that our 

position is that section 5 is clear that this court

1 should not start with the interim plan, but if the Court 

2 disagrees with me, I think that that's a much more 

3 reasonable approach than the one offered by the State, 

4 for the same reason argued by the United States. That 

is, that in the State's argument, you really turn 

6 section 5 on its head because one of the principal 

7 benefits for the minority community in having section 5 

8 is it alters of the burden of proof. And if you 

9 maintain the burden of proof on the State before it can 

implement any portion of its newly adopted but 

11 un-precleared plan, that's far more preferable than 

12 shifting the burden, which would be inconsistent with 

13 section 5 in its intent. 

14  I don't think I have anything else.

 (Laughter.)

that makes remedying a one person, one vote problem

1 particularly unique is there's literally an infinite 

2 number of ways to solve the problem. And for that 

3 reason, this Court has always looked wherever it could 

4 to legislative guidance, so much so that in White v. 

Weiser, this Court looked for legislative guidance to a 

6 plan that had been declared unconstitutional for failing 

7 to accommodate one person, one vote problems, but yet 

8 this Court still said that the district court erred in 

9 not taking that into account to the extent that it 

could. 

11  As to the hard choice, if it comes to that, 

12 of using either the legislative plan that reflects the 

13 legislative will or the judicial plan that even the 

14 United States concedes is flawed, I think this Court has 

faced even more difficult choices in the past: Bullock 

16 v. Weiser and in Whitcomb. And in both of those cases, 

17 this Court chose between an adjudicatedly 

18 unconstitutional State plan and a judicial remedy that 

19 it determined was flawed. And in both cases, it ordered 

the election to take place under the flawed 

21 constitutionally adjudicated imperfect plan. 

22  Compared to that, simply saying that an 

23 election should go forward under a plan that hasn't been 

24 precleared is a far less serious step.

 Now, there was a reference made to the 3

1 days of hearings. But the problem is, 3 days of 

2 hearings with an unadministrable standard is worse than 

3 1 day of hearing with an unadministrable standard.  And 

4 what we ask is for a preliminary injunction standard 

that's familiar to everybody, everybody understands, and 

6 everybody can apply. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why shouldn't it be 

8 inverted the way your friend suggests? 

9  MR. CLEMENT: Well, I'll join everybody in 

saying that that's -- that's better than the -- than the 

11 worst alternative I face, which is to say it's better 

12 than the district court's opinion. 

13  But here's why it shouldn't: That actually 

14 further intrudes on the D.C. court because the question 

that the remedial court should not be asking is, geez, 

16 do I really think -- you know, what are the odds that 

17 the D.C. court is going to preclear? It shouldn't ask 

18 that question at all. It should ask the questions that 

19 are before it. Is there a section 2 violation? Is 

there an equal protection violation? If there aren't 

21 those and I use the State's plan, does that create a 

22 section 5 violation? 

23  That's different from the preclearance 

24 question. And on that section 5 question, the burden is 

not logically on the State. And that's the same section

1 5 question that the court considered on its own motion, 

2 because it understands that even when it takes a plan, 

3 it has to be consistent with section 5 principles. 

4  Now, Justice Kennedy, you've asked the 

question, what if we take section 5 out of this, what 

6 happens? Then it's an easy case. Then it's the 

7 preliminary injunction standard. Now, the objection to 

8 that, of course, is, well, but how can you take section 

9 5 out of it?  But there's not interference with section 

5 because Texas still understands it needs to get 

11 preclearance. Before its changes can take permanent 

12 effect, it absolutely, positively needs preclearance. 

13 It's never wavered from that recognition. So, you go 

14 back -- I'll --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish the sentence. 

16  MR. CLEMENT: Okay. Well, I was simply 

17 going to say if you go back, the default problem here is 

18 that there's an infinite number of solutions. It's 

19 particularly a problem with respect to the congressional 

map, where there's now four new seats. There's nothing 

21 else to defer to than the judgment of the legislature 

22 reflected in this plan, notwithstanding that it hasn't 

23 been precleared.
