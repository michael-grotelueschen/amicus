CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case Number 11-1425, 

Missouri v. McNeely. 

Mr. Koester. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN N. KOESTER, JR., 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. KOESTER: Thank you. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the 

Court: 

In the course of a drunk driving 

investigation, quickly securing blood alcohol evidence 

with as little delay as possible is incredibly 

important --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How come it took so long 

for this State to figure out that it needed to do this 

without a warrant? 

MR. KOESTER: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The officer testified 

that he's been making drunk driving arrests for years --

MR. KOESTER: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and I think in only 

one circumstance did he need to do it without a warrant. 

So what made the need here eminent in the sense of

impractical to get the warrant? 

MR. KOESTER: Well, Your Honor, back in 

2003, there was a -- an appellate court case from 

Missouri that dealt with the importance of the words --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I understand why he 

decided to do it, to forego getting a warrant. Isn't 

his testimony dispositive of this case? He had time to 

get it. 

MR. KOESTER: Your Honor, that -- that 

ignores the fact that had he sought a warrant -- there's 

no question that he would have been able to secure a 

warrant. The issue was, it was going to take a 

considerable amount of time. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it took a 

considerable amount of time for all the years he did it. 

MR. KOESTER: That's true, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And -- and he didn't 

testify to it -- it causing a loss of any particular 

case. 

MR. KOESTER: But in this particular case, 

it was going to take 90 minutes to two hours to secure 

the warrant. And during that period of time, the most 

probative evidence was going to be dissipating, was 

going to be lost. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he said -- he said in

the ten or so cases he had had in the past, I had -- I 

encountered no difficulty getting a warrant in prior 

cases. There was nothing that distinguished this case 

on the facts from other cases on the facts. 

MR. KOESTER: That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg, he never had a problem securing a warrant, but 

there was a delay; and that's -- that's the difference. 

We're -- we're looking at a delay, and quickly securing 

blood alcohol evidence is important because the -- the 

evidence is being lost at a significant rate with every 

minute that passes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What constitutional 

right exists for a State to get the best evidence? 

MR. KOESTER: Well, Justice Sotomayor, I 

think that that is something that we should always 

strive for, to be able to get the best possible evidence 

in the case. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no. You, the 

State, want to strive for that. But what in the Fourth 

Amendment contemplates that that's a right the State 

must have, that is has to get the very best evidence it 

can? 

MR. KOESTER: The -- the touchstone of any 

Fourth Amendment analysis is the reasonableness of the 

search. And it's reasonable -Â­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how can it be 

reasonable to forego the Fourth Amendment in a procedure 

as intrusive as a needle going into someone's body? 

say this because breathalyzers in my mind have a much 

different intrusion level. They don't intrude into your 

body. And I think almost all jurisdictions use 

breathalyzers instead of blood tests. A small fraction 

that actually use blood tests. 

The ruling by us today is going to change 

that and is going to -- if in your favor is going to 

change that and is going to -- if in your favor, is 

going to change that and put sort of a print, the 

Court's print, on: Use the most intrusive way you can 

to prove your case. 

MR. KOESTER: And, Justice Sotomayor, I 

would -- I would disagree with that. If the Court rules 

in our favor, I think the end result will be more people 

will agree to take the breathalyzer test. In this case, 

the arresting officer gave the defendant an option to 

take the breathalyzer test and when he clearly told him 

he was not going to take it, that's when he decided to 

take him to the hospital in order to draw the blood. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why don't you force him to 

take the breathalyzer test, instead of forcing him to 

have a needle shoved in his -- in his arm?

MR. KOESTER: For practical --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what is the 

difference between the reliability or the acceptability 

by juries of a breathalyzer test, as opposed to a blood 

draw? 

MR. KOESTER: Justice Scalia, both tests are 

very reliable. We rely on the breathalyzer test on a 

daily basis, but for practical reasons it's very 

difficult to force a drunk driver to take a breath test. 

The breathalyzer instruments, they measure deep lung 

alveolar air. 

And you have to take a very deep breath. 

And one police officer told me it's sort of like you can 

put a balloon in front of somebody's mouth, but you 

can't make him blow it up. It's very difficult for 

practical reasons to force someone to -- to blow into 

the breathalyzer. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we are talking about 

reasonableness, do you think it's relevant for us to 

look to the rules and practices of other States? 

MR. KOESTER: Justice Kennedy, as the 

Respondent points out, there are 25 States that would be 

opposed to -- to the warrantless blood draw at issue in 

this case. And as I point out in the reply brief, 15 of 

those States have joined amicus Delaware urging this

Court to reverse the decision of the Missouri Supreme 

Court, but I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the fact that those 

States do have a warrant requirement and from what we 

can best tell make it work very well, including some 

expedited procedures where you can get warrants within 

minutes -- it takes usually the policemen, say, 20 

minutes to get just to the hospital or the police 

station anyway. 

MR. KOESTER: And, Justice --

And if -- if we see that other States, a 

significant amount of other States, number one, require 

the warrant, number two, many of those have expedited 

procedures, does that bear on our determination of 

reasonableness? 

MR. KOESTER: I don't believe it does, 

Justice Kennedy. I think, as -- as Virginia v. Moore 

plainly teaches, individual State laws do not affect 

whether or not this activity was reasonable under the 

Constitution. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But we have -- have 

always -- correct me if I'm wrong. I think that we have 

always thought of Fourth Amendment reasonableness 

standards as being a national standard. Suppose 40 

States -- you know, we can play the game. Suppose 40

States had rules that you have warrants and many of them 

had expedited procedures. That's still irrelevant? We 

don't look at that at all? 

MR. KOESTER: Your Honor, I think this 

Court's decision in Sampson v. California is 

instructive. In that particular case, the Court 

approved suspicion-less searches of parolees, and I 

think a vast majority of States disapproved of that 

particular law enforcement practice. But that does not 

bear on the issue of whether or not that violates the 

Fourth Amendment. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course we don't know why 

they disapproved. And I guess your point is they may 

well not have permitted it because they were under what 

you would call the mistaken belief that it was 

unconstitutional. 

MR. KOESTER: I suppose that is -- that is a 

possibility, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there any showing that 

conviction rate in those States is lower than in the 

States where the practice is -- is to take the test 

without the warrant? 

MR. KOESTER: Your Honor, I think amici 

National District Attorneys Association cited a study. 

I know the Respondent also cited a study that shows it

doesn't have any bearing. But I think it's -- it's 

pretty clear that if you have concrete evidence of a 

drunk driver's blood alcohol content, concrete evidence, 

that gives you a far greater case, a far greater chance 

of securing a conviction at trial. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the new rule is we 

have to strengthen -- the Fourth Amendment is going to 

be suspended whenever the prosecution can't get the best 

evidence to make its case out? 

MR. KOESTER: No, Justice Sotomayor. I 

think as long as a police officer has probable cause, 

what -- what we're saying is it's objectively --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Probable cause is 

not enough. If you have probable cause, then you can 

get a warrant. But it was and I think still is the main 

rule that if you can get a warrant, you must do that. 

Probable cause is surely not enough. Then we'd never 

need a warrant when there's probable cause. 

MR. KOESTER: You are absolutely right, 

Justice Ginsburg, probable cause is not enough. But 

probable cause coupled with the indisputable fact that 

alcohol is eliminated from the human body with every 

minute that passes after a drunk driver is pulled 

over --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Koester, suppose that,

instead of waiting two hours, there were procedures in 

place in Missouri and, indeed, across the country where 

it was possible to get a warrant in these circumstances 

within 15 or 20 minutes. Would you still be saying that 

there is a sufficient exigency to avoid the warrant 

requirement? 

MR. KOESTER: I think if a particular 

jurisdiction had perfected the warrant process to the 

point where they could routinely obtain search warrants 

in 15 minutes, I think we would have a different 

outcome. I think that would affect the analysis of the 

case. But with all due respect to the hypothetical, I 

think it is a time-consuming process to obtain search 

warrants. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So why can't you do that? 

I mean, the only virtue I see in saying you have to go 

get a warrant is the officer picks up the phone, there 

is usually somebody on duty, a magistrate somewhere, he 

phones him up and says, I have a drunk driver here; he's 

wobbling, he can't cross the center line; and he won't 

take a breathalyzer; I want to give him a test. 

Now, you have a second judgment and the 

officer has to talk to somebody, so he's a little more 

careful. And that's a protection, not necessarily for 

this person, but a protection for others who maybe

1 weren't wobbling. 

2  All right. So I think that's the question 

3 you're being asked. Why -- what's the problem with 

4 doing that? Which adds a little bit of security that 

this warrant really is -- this search is really 

6 necessary. 

7  MR. KOESTER: Justice Breyer, I think in 

8 practical application it is going to be more of a 

9 time-consuming process, though, to obtain the search --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why wouldn't it take --

11 let's see, how long did it take me to say that? It took 

12 me about 30 seconds. So -- so even if you are a lot 

13 more careful, why would it take more than, say, 

14 3 minutes? 

MR. KOESTER: To obtain a search warrant --

16  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what you do is you 

17 have a system, and you phone up and you do just what I 

18 said. And this man or woman who is there is not a 

19 policeman. That's the virtue of it is this man or woman is 

trained to listen to policemen and others say things and 

21 try to pin him down a little bit and make an independent 

22 judgment. So -- so why would it take more than 5 

23 minutes?

why I drew the analogy between the telephonic search

warrants that were approved back in the 1970s. It 

sounds like that would be an instantaneous procedure, 

but some of the lower courts that have actually examined 

the process, they came to the conclusion that it's still 

a time consuming process --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Koester, in most 

jurisdictions, unless I'm mistaken, the cop on the beat 

cannot apply for and get a search warrant. He has to go 

through a prosecuting attorney or someone in the 

prosecutor's office first. So it's not just getting 

hold of a judge. It's getting hold of the prosecutor 

first and then getting hold of the judge if the 

prosecutor approves it, right? 

MR. KOESTER: That is -- is absolutely 

correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that the case in 

Missouri? 

MR. KOESTER: That is the case in Missouri. 

The prosecution attorney --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In some cases I 

suppose the judges actually want to read the affidavit 

and give it some thought. It's not going to be 3 

minutes. 

MR. KOESTER: That's exactly right, 

Mr. Chief Justice. I think if we were to the point

where we were approving search warrants in 3 minutes, it 

would essentially be a rubber stamp --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we do have -- we do 

have, I think, an indication that there are 

jurisdictions that do it inside of a half-hour. 

MR. KOESTER: That -- that may be true, 

Justice Ginsburg. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So do you define 

reasonableness --

JUSTICE KAGAN: You suggest that 15 or 20 

would be a different case. I am wondering where you 

would draw the bright line. 

MR. KOESTER: That's a difficult question, 

to draw a bright line for exactly when we would draw the 

line where -- where the exigency would disappear. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So would the importance 

of the search warrant suggest, as a constitutional 

right, suggest that we should judge reasonableness by 

the people who are the least efficient or by the people 

who are the most reasonably efficient? 

MR. KOESTER: Well, Justice Sotomayor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Meaning people, police 

jurisdictions. 

MR. KOESTER: In -- of course, local law 

enforcement practices are going to vary from

within a reasonable range? 

6  MR. KOESTER: Well, I think prosecutors are 

7 always going to strive to -- obtain search warrants as 

8 efficiently as possible. But whether or not this was a 

9 reasonable search does not depend upon local police 

practices.

I would like to pick up where some of the 

Court's questions led off: This idea that we might live 

in a world where warrants could be gotten so quickly 

that -- there is not true exigency. First of all, that 

is not state of the world now. There is substantial 

variation from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and we are 

just not in a place where the time to get the warrant 

everywhere is 15 minutes or less. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- I mean, once we say 

that you don't need a warrant -- you know, even if 

things improve, the game's up, right? No? 

MS. SAHARSKY: No, I don't think that that's 

true at all. The police do not have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You mean somebody can come 

up 10 years from now and say, although you approved it 

10 years ago without a warrant, things have changed, so 

now you need a warrant? 

MS. SAHARSKY: I think that if the world 

changed so that every police officer had an iPad and 

that judges were always on duty and that the warrants 

could be gotten that quickly, you would consider that 

and you would also consider the other sources of delay, 

which are the time to get to the hospital, etcetera, 

etcetera. But yes, I would -Â­

then why shouldn't that determination be made case by

MS. SAHARSKY: Because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Case by case, whether in 

fact it would have taken that long to get a warrant? 

And if it -- if it would have taken too long, then it's 

okay without a warrant. If it wouldn't have taken that 

long, it's bad. 

MS. SAHARSKY: The question --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Totality of the 

circumstances test, right? 

MS. SAHARSKY: Right, but the totality of 

the circumstances are with respect to the destruction of 

evidence and what the police are witnessing. They know 

there is certain destruction of evidence and what they 

are weighing that against is uncertainty about whether 

there's time to get a warrant. They have no idea what 

this person's blood alcohol content is. They have no 

idea how fast it's decreasing. They might --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Saharsky, what about 

saying at least they should try, since a number of 

jurisdictions can do this within a half hour, say, 

initiate the process while you are going to the 

hospital; when a half-hour is up you proceed; but at

least there has been an effort to get a warrant. 

MS. SAHARSKY: I think there -- I think 

there are legal problems with that and practical 

problems with that. The legal problems is that the 

Court has never suggested that the police are both 

simultaneously in require-a-warrant land and not in 

require-a-warrant land. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we have -- I don't 

want to because you have multiple answers -- but on that 

point, we do talk about exigent circumstances. If -- if 

we proceed as Justice Ginsburg's suggestion indicates, 

then the fact that you can't get a warrant within 

45 minutes is the exigent circumstance. 

MS. SAHARSKY: Right. I mean, in all of the 

destruction of evidence cases the Court has said, 

There's destruction of evidence; we're not going to make 

you wait until half of it is destroyed or three-fourths 

of it is destroyed or something like. And that's the 

rule really that Respondents want. Everyone --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Justice Ginsburg said 

30 minutes. 

MS. SAHARSKY: Right. And what I'm saying 

is as a practical matter, I think it would be very 

difficult to -- to suspect that nationwide folks could 

get warrants in those circumstances. You typically have

search warrant because he's the one who's witnessing --

6  JUSTICE ALITO: Jurisdictions have an

8 they -- even if we were to say that they don't need one, 

9 they certainly have a strong incentive to get warrants 

because it insulates the search to a much greater degree 

11 from later challenge -- at a suppression hearing. So 

12 why shouldn't it depend on the practicalities in a 

13 particular jurisdiction? 

14  Not every jurisdiction has prosecutors and 

judges who are staying up at -- you know, 3:00 o'clock 

16 in the morning on Sunday morning waiting for the phone 

17 to ring or for -- to receive some sort of an electronic 

18 message that there has been a stop and somebody wants 

19 a -- wants a search warrant. Maybe -- you know, big 

jurisdictions can do that, but small ones can't. 

21  So why -- but if you are in a big 

22 jurisdiction that -- or one that feels that they can 

23 afford that, then why should -- you know, why should the 

24 Fourth Amendment permit the search to take place without 

the warrant when it could have been obtained practically --

MS. SAHARSKY: Well, I mean, a couple of 

responses. First of all, this Court makes nationwide 

rules and the question is whether it's reasonable to do 

what Missouri did here even if other jurisdictions would 

choose to or could do it differently. 

But second -- you know, this idea with respect 

to -- that it should matter based on the time to get a 

warrant is something the Court has never done in its 

Fourth Amendment exigency cases. And it may be the case 

that a court looking backwards could say, well, we think 

you had enough time to get a warrant. 

But the police officer where he stands with 

the person, he knows a few things. He knows one thing 

for sure: That evidence is going to be lost, and it's 

critical evidence. It's not just to get above .08, but 

you have these laws that are enhanced with --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought -- I thought 

that we often said that you look at whether or not you 

can get a warrant before you can break in so that the 

drugs aren't flushed down the toilet and so forth. We 

make that judgment all the time. 

MS. SAHARSKY: Right. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if that showing is not 

made, you must get a warrant.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So I think it's quite 

incorrect to say that we -- we don't look at the time 

factor. 

MS. SAHARSKY: I think it matters as a 

general --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: We look at it all the 

time. 

MS. SAHARSKY: I think it matters as a 

general matter whether warrants take time to get and 

whether evidence is lost. But the Court has never gone 

jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It has never 

second-guessed the police in the way that the Court is 

suggesting today. 

In Kentucky v. King, for example, an 

exigency case, the Court said the police could have 

proceeded a couple of different ways here; we are not 

going to make them use the least restrictive way; we are 

just going to ask whether what they did was reasonable. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree that there is a 

uniform standard. But -- and I don't know if you ever 

did finish the answer to Justice Ginsburg, but she --

she had suggested that we have a uniform rule of exigent 

circumstances. That -- her suggestion complies with 

your objection.

it correctly, I think our point is this, which is that 

the police officers have to act reasonably in the 

situation. And in a situation they know for sure the 

evidence is going to be lost, they know that every 

minute is critical. For example, Respondent here's 

blood --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there are so many 

situations in which we require a warrant, nevertheless. 

When there is drug dealing in a house, every time people 

enter that house, it's almost a certainty that they're 

going to use the drugs and that evidence is going to 

disappear. You rely on hope -- on knowing that there's 

likely to be telltale signs left over. 

And that's the same thing you do in an 

alcohol situation. You rely on the testimony of the 

police officer, you rely on the implied consent 

presumption. It's not as if this is destruction of all 

evidence, and -- and not like a fleeing situation where 

someone gets away, you have nothing left. This is --

this is vastly different. 

MS. SAHARSKY: I mean, with respect, we 

disagree. This evidence is critical, and the number 

matters. I mean, it is the case that blood alcohol 

evidence is the most important evidence. This Court has 

recognized this in several cases -- Schmerber,

Skinner -- and since then the law has only changed to 

make it more important. In 2005 you had --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You mentioned Schmerber. 

Why did the Court go through all of the -- why -- it 

could have made it a much shorter opinion by simply 

saying, yes, blood alcohol dissipates. But it didn't. 

It -- it pointed out that in that particular case there 

was a delay to investigate the accident, the person had 

to be taken to the hospital for care, so how much time 

elapsed? I think it was two hours, wasn't it? 

MS. SAHARSKY: The Court -- made a mention 

of two hours, but that was not a critical portion of its 

analysis. We don't think that that mattered to 

Schmerber because the Court said, first, there was clear 

probable cause in that situation. Second of all --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was all the -- why 

was it in the opinion? 

MS. SAHARSKY: Well, it's one line in the 

opinion. If you look at it, the Court says, we are told 

the percentage of alcohol in the blood begins to 

diminish shortly after drinking stops, the body 

functions to eliminate it from the system. Particularly 

in a case like this, time had to be taken to bring the 

accused to a hospital and to investigate the scene --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. They didn't need to

say any of that. 

MS. SAHARSKY: Well, they said particularly 

it means there's an extra thing. But it doesn't mean 

that the first thing wasn't enough. And what we say is 

if there was some uncertainty in Schmerber, the Court's 

case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't mean that it 

was enough, either, right? 

MS. SAHARSKY: Well, that gives me the 

second part of my answer, which is the Court's cases 

since Schmerber have relied on the destruction of this 

evidence being enough for exigency. 

And I would just point the Court to look at 

Skinner, at South Dakota v. Neville, at Winston v. Lee, 

and even in a footnote in Kentucky v. King. This Court 

has not said anything about the person having to go to 

the hospital and whether there was an investigation --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel for Missouri tells 

us, Ms. Saharsky, that the breathalyzer is just as good 

and that in fact he expects that the consequence of our 

ruling in his favor in this case will be that drunken 

drivers will agree to the breathalyzer test. 

But I don't know why it isn't adequate to 

produce that result simply to put the drunken driver in 

a -- in a paddy wagon and on the way to the hospital

say -- you know, we're going to be in the hospital in 

20 minutes; we're applying for a warrant; when we get 

there, we're going to -- we're going to -- you know, 

stick a needle in your arm, unless, of course, you agree 

to take the breathalyzer test. Why isn't that enough 

to -- to force them into the breathalyzer test, so that 

they will blow up the balloon. 

MS. SAHARSKY: Well, because in that 

situation, I think they're willing to take their chances 

that the evidence is going to dissipate below the .08 

standard or below these higher enhanced penalties, .15, 

and then be able to challenge it, as opposed to if they 

gave the evidence that they potentially wouldn't be able 

to challenge it. 

But I think the point that comes --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Or maybe they're drunk. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, but, but -- I mean, 

Justice Scalia raises a point, which is you always have 

some delay. Unless you are talking about sticking a 

needle in somebody roadside, you have to take them to 

the hospital. So there's going to be some amount of 

time which you're going to lose, and why can't you use 

that amount of time, if you can, to try to get a 

warrant?

MS. SAHARSKY: Well, I think there are two 

answers. One, you typically as a practical matter have 

one officer on the scene who's proceeding with this and 

he's the one that would have to prepare the affidavit, 

typically the one to consult with the prosecutor. He's 

the one who's going to drive to the hospital. 

Presumably, we don't want him texting during driving, et 

cetera. 

The second answer is a legal answer, which 

is that the Court has been very hesitant to second-guess 

the police in these circumstances and to say when the 

police are in a fluid situation they have to, say, try 

to get a second officer on the scene and maybe do the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Now, I think you should be 

fair. He doesn't have to prepare a written affidavit in 

a number of these States. It's a telephonic warrant. 

You have to give us that. 

MS. SAHARSKY: Well, even in some of the 

telephonic -- telephonic warrant procedures, you still 

have to have a written document. You just write it out 

and then you read it to the judge and then actually a 

record needs to be made of it. The case United States 

v. Reid in the Fourth Circuit actually considered this 

and said -- you know, it sounds like it won't take that 

long, but it turns out these procedures actually take a

while. 

And it's not just the time to get a warrant. 

It's the initial time that had been taken at the stop, 

the investigation, the field sobriety test. Then, 

there's the time to get to the hospital. And -- you 

know, sometimes these people, these folks, get to the 

hospital and they're not given first priority, so 

there's sometimes some waiting at the hospital. So a 

significant --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So is it okay -- is it 

okay to let police officers take the blood? 

MS. SAHARSKY: Well, we think that's a 

different question and one that the Court reserved in 

Schmerber. The Court said there was medical personnel 

in a medical setting taking the blood in that case. 

That's the exact same thing that's happening here. 

But it said if we had a different case, we'd 

ask whether the -- the situation invited an unjustified 

element of personal risk of infection and pain. So we 

think the Court should get a case that has a record on 

this and then it could make a determination as to 

whether there is that risk. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Oh, I bet that if we 

rule in your favor, we will. 

MS. SAHARSKY: I'm not sure that that's

true. The reason that a few States have considered 

having police officers get trained in this way is 

basically out of necessity. It is just in rural 

jurisdictions it's too far to get to the nearest 

hospital. 

But it's fair to say that police officers do 

not want to be in this business of taking blood. It 

diverts them from their other activities. It's -- you 

know, it's an extensive training process. So I -- I'm 

not sure that that's true, but it's not something the 

Court has to decide --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you want to be in 

those rural places and be stopped without an independent 

magistrate approving a field officer taking blood from 

you? 

MS. SAHARSKY: Well, what I'm saying is that 

there are only a few States that are doing it now, and I 

think it is -- it should be -- the Court should wait 

until it actually has a record to make that 

determination. But -- you know, there has been training 

along those lines. 

That's something, for example, that NHTSA at 

the Department of Transportation has helped these States 

investigate whether it's a real option because the 

police officers are very far away from -- you know, the

nearest hospital and that it's -- it's all based on this 

concern about destruction of evidence. 

But just to get back to --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think going back to 

Justice Scalia's question, if a person does take a 

breathalyzer, is there ever a reason for a warrantless 

blood test? 

MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. As a general matter, 

you would not need to obtain a blood test -- you know, 

practically because the evidence is not the same, but --

you know, substantially as good. The blood test is a 

little better in that you have a sample that sticks 

around as opposed to one that is gone. You also get two 

samples, so the defense can test it, and it is better 

evidence with respect to whether it's susceptible to 

challenge. 

You also might have someone who consents to 

a breath test, but because, as you pointed out, they're 

so drunk they can't give a good sample, like they say 

they'll provide a sample, but they really just can't. 

And then there's another case that is not 

the fact here, but something we would want the Court to 

be careful about, which is driving under the influence 

of drugs. Those do not show up on a breath test, but 

the police officers might have very good reason to

believe that the person is under the influence, such 

that they might take a breath test and get a zero 

reading, but still want to take a warrantless blood 

test. 

So all the Court needs to do to resolve this 

case is say where this person refused a breathalyzer --

actually, the exact same facts of Schmerber -- it was --

it was reasonable for the police to say, we know this 

evidence is going away, we know it's going to be lost, 

maybe we can get a warrant quickly, maybe we can't, we 

don't know what his blood alcohol is, we don't know when 

it's going to dip below .15, .08, let's just go ahead 

and proceed. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: All this talk about -- you 

know, losing evidence every second, I mean, I suppose 

the exact same thing could be said in other 

alcohol-related crimes, public drunkenness, underage 

drinking. You wouldn't be making the same arguments 

there, would you? Or would you? 

MS. SAHARSKY: No. I mean, the -- the 

question you'd ask will be the same, which would be a 

reasonableness balancing test, but I think the 

government interest on the side of that balance would be 

very different from the ones at issue here. You know, 

the Court here has said that drunk driving is a serious

public safety problem. We're talking about one person 

being killed every 51 minutes, despite everything we've 

done in the last 3 decades. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: So it's not just exigency 

that you're -- you're saying that there should be a 

weighing of the costs and benefits here. 

MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. That's what the Court 

did in Schmerber. It looked at the intrusiveness of the 

blood test in this context and then it looked at the 

government's need for the evidence. And the need for 

the evidence in the cases you're positing we suspect the 

Court would not think as strong as the evidence here. 

But just to get back to some of the 

questions the Court has had about the time to get 

warrants, I mean, the evidence that the Court has before 

it is that it would take at least an hour and a half to 

two hours to get a warrant here. That's in the Joint 

Appendix, page 54. Even though the person said -- one 

officer said he could get in touch with the prosecutor 

and judge, he did not quantify how long it would take. 

There's also an exhibit that the defense --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Incidentally, it wasn't 

clear to me: Is that 1 hour from the time of the --

pardon me -- two hours from the time of the stop or two 

hours from the time he put him in the back of the patrol

States where warrants were required tried to get them

may stick a needle in the arm of everyone arrested on 

suspicion of drunk driving without a warrant and without 

consent. Missouri's answer to that question is yes, 

even in routine DWI cases like this and regardless of 

how quickly and easily a warrant could be obtained. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought the question was 

if -- if in fact the person won't agree to a 

breathalyzer. 

MR. SHAPIRO: The question is -- it's not 

clear to me. Number one, Your Honor, there's nothing in 

the record to suggest that the driver is always first 

offered the opportunity, the choice of choosing a 

breathalyzer as opposed to --

breathalyzer, Your Honor.

MR. SHAPIRO: And declined it twice, that's 

correct, Your Honor.

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, aside from all --

the thing, what it boils down to, at least in my mind, 

is, is yes, of course it would be better to -- to have a 

neutral person hear what the policeman has to say and to 

act as a second judgment on that; it would make it less 

likely that people who are really innocent, in fact, 

have this happen to them and so forth. 

But they're arguing that that's a -- that's 

a considerable burden in many, but not all States. And 

at some point -- and the addition in respect to the 

second judgment, namely the magistrates that you get, is 

not worth really what you're going to lose, which are 

going to be people who are drunk driving around on roads 

and -- and possibly killing people. We all know how 

that side can be built up, too. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So at some point, I would 

wish you would spend some time addressing that, that 

practical argument. 

MR. SHAPIRO: I'd be happy to answer that 

question right now, Your Honor. I think there are two 

responses. One is Missouri specific and case specific 

and one is more generic because I think it's important 

to remember they are not asking simply to reverse the 

suppression motion in this case on the grounds that the

facts of this case made it reasonable to do a 

warrantless blood draw. 

What Missouri and the United States are 

urging is a categorical exemption to the warrant 

requirement in all DWI cases nationwide. So we have to 

think not only about --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is this a lot of sound and 

fury signifying nothing? I mean, what -- what advantage 

do you think your client would -- would really get from 

the warrant requirement other than the delay that that 

would entail allowing his blood alcohol to reduce 

itself? 

Are the -- for some warrants, let's say a 

warrant to go into a building where the police contend 

there may be drugs, the policeman will -- will you know, 

the magistrate will say, What evidence do you have that 

there's drugs? Well -- you know, two weeks ago we had 

this informer, yesterday we saw this and so -- you know, 

all sorts of different factors. 

In these DUI cases it's always going to be 

the same thing. The policeman is going to say, well --

you know, his breath smelled of alcohol; we gave him the 

walk a straight line and turn around test, he flunked 

it; he couldn't touch his nose with his index finger.

MR. SHAPIRO: Your Honor, I do not know the 

answer to that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I bet you they're not. 

MR. SHAPIRO: But I think it's also true, 

Your Honor, that warrants in general are rarely turned 

down, that the overwhelming percentage of warrant 

requests in all criminal cases are granted -- are 

granted by magistrates. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But in many of them there 

is a lot of judgment that has to be brought to bear: Is 

this a reliable informant, how long ago did he tell you, 

and so forth. Whereas, in all of these cases it's going 

to be the same thing: His breath smelled of alcohol, he 

couldn't walk a straight line, and whatnot. And -- and 

that's the probable cause. And I don't see how the 

independent magistrate is going to do you a whole lot of 

good, except for the fact that it will delay the 

process. 

MR. SHAPIRO: This Court's entire Fourth 

Amendment jurisprudence, Your Honor, rests on the 

proposition that the privacy safeguards of the Fourth 

Amendment benefit by having a neutral and detached

4  And I could imagine a situation --

JUSTICE ALITO: What if the State has a 

6 form; we have some forms in the Joint Appendix. What if it 

7 has a form for the officer to fill out? He checks 

8 certain boxes, and then you send this electronically to 

9 a magistrate, and if the right boxes are checked, the 

magistrate will grant the warrant. 

11  Is that -- do you think that is consistent 

12 with the Fourth Amendment? 

13  MR. SHAPIRO: Well, it's something very 

14 close to what Missouri already has, Your Honor. In Cape 

Girardeau County the prosecutor has prepared 

16 standardized forms which the police officer then fills 

17 out, presents to the prosecutor, the prosecutors sends 

18 on to the magistrate and the magistrate decides whether 

19 to grant the warrant. But I think that cuts in exactly 

the opposite direction, which it shows that the process 

21 of obtaining a warrant is not very elaborate and it need 

22 it not be very timely. 

23  And I can imagine, in answer to 

24 Justice Scalia's questions, I can imagine circumstances

situation where they have not asked the driver, for 

example, to go through the field sobriety test; said as 

they -- as we stopped the driver on the road, he was 

going 10 miles over the speed limit, I questioned him, 

his speech was slurred, his eyes seemed bloodshot, I 

want to do a blood test. 

And the magistrate in that circumstance 

might say, did you at least perform the field sobriety 

test? Did you at least offer --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about that field 

sobriety test? Suppose the person who is apprehended 

and is suspected of being drunk says, I'm not going to 

walk a straight line. I'm going to just sit here. You 

can't make me do anything without a warrant. 

Do you need -- if the defendant doesn't 

consent, do you need a warrant to -- to have the 

standard sobriety test? 

MR. SHAPIRO: Do you mean do you need a 

warrant to have the field sobriety test? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Is that the question, Justice 

Ginsburg? I don't think you need a warrant to require 

somebody to put his finger to his nose or to walk a 

straight line or to stand on one foot. I would not say

But there is no doubt that putting a needle 

in somebody's arm triggers a warrant requirement. And I 

think there are really two --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about a 

breathalyzer, do you need a warrant for that? 

MR. SHAPIRO: I think you probably do need a 

warrant for a breathalyzer, Your Honor. But --

Missouri's position is you not only don't need a warrant 

for a breathalyzer, you don't need a warrant for a blood 

test. And we don't -- this is not a breathalyzer case. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know what 

Missouri's position is, and I know it's not a 

breathalyzer test. But if the logic of your position 

leads to the requirement of a warrant for breathalyzer, 

that would be pertinent in analyzing your position. 

MR. SHAPIRO: I think -- I think, Your 

Honor, it -- I would say that requiring somebody to 

produce, to breathe into a machine for -- in order to 

gather evidence for the State's prosecution is a 

state -- is a search that should probably trigger the 

warrant requirement, but it is certainly a less -- it is 

certainly less intrusive, Your Honor, it is certainly 

less intrusive than -- than the blood test --

the reasonableness, doesn't it? I don't know why you 

want to bite off more than you can chew. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, I certainly don't want 

to bite -- I want to bite off --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a different case and 

what is reasonable for sticking a needle in your arm is 

not necessarily reasonable for asking you to blow up a 

balloon. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Your Honor, I certainly want 

to bite off as little as I have to chew in this case, 

but -- but there are two salient facts because I think 

it is important to focus on what is before the Court in 

this case. And what is before the Court in this case is 

a warrantless blood draw, and the two salient facts in 

my mind are, one, as I said, case specific. 

You have a State trooper here who has been 

doing this for 17 and a half years. He testifies at the 

suppression hearing that he has only been required to 

seek a warrant fewer than ten times. Why is that? That 

is because the overwhelming number of drivers, in fact, 

give their consent. And in the ten cases over those 

17 years where he had to seek a warrant, he testifies 

that he never had any difficulty obtaining a warrant, 

and there is certainly no indication that those warrants 

in any way interfered with the State's ability to

1 prosecute those cases. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Shapiro, could you 

3 tell me, and what I am deeply troubled about in your 

4 argument, is you incant the totality of the 

circumstances test. But what circumstances is the Court 

6 actually looking at to determine whether forgoing the 

7 warrant was necessary or not under that circumstance? 

8 We know one. We know where a fatality has occurred or a 

9 serious accident because we -- presumably you have to 

secure the scene and you have to take care of injured 

11 people or have cars towed, whatever else it is. 

12  But I'm not sure what other circumstances 

13 under your theory would really justify a magistrate -- a 

14 court below saying, you -- you know, it's okay, you didn't 

get a warrant here. It can't be merely because it takes 

16 too long to get the warrant because that shows 

17 inefficiency. It was part of my question earlier. 

18  MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, so that's exactly 

19 correct, Your Honor. I think the Court got it right in 

Schmerber. I think the question is: Are there special 

21 facts that are extrinsic to the warrant process itself 

22 and that are beyond the control of the police that 

23 significantly impede the ability of the police even to 

24 initiate the warrant process.

rural -- in a rural jurisdiction and it takes a long 

time to rouse a prosecutor and a magistrate at 3:00 in 

the morning to get the warrant. You would say, that's 

too bad, everybody has -- the whole country has to 

operate like New York City, you have to have somebody on 

duty all the time. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, Cape 

Girardeau County is a rural county in southeastern 

Missouri --

JUSTICE ALITO: But I'm asking you a 

hypothetical question. I -- I bet there are places like 

that. I have encountered magistrate -- Federal 

magistrate judges who were unreceptive to receiving 

warrant applications in the middle of the night, and 

that is known to -- to exist. Suppose you have a 

jurisdiction like that? Does that count as a 

circumstance that would justify a warrantless taking of 

blood? 

MR. SHAPIRO: I would say no, Your Honor. 

don't think the State ought to be able to take advantage 

of its own failure to modernize an expedited --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the magistrate is 

unavailable because he or she is ill?

6 alternative magistrate. 

7  But the second salient fact, Your Honor --

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Shapiro, that's a separate question, 

9 isn't it? I mean, one prong of your argument is you 

need individualized circumstances, you can't have a per 

11 se rule. And now this other set of questions is about what 

12 you get to count in the totality of the circumstances 

13 test; is that right? 

14  MR. SHAPIRO: That is correct, 

Justice Kagan. 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: So one could disagree with 

17 you and one could think, as Justice Alito and 

18 Justice Kennedy suggested -- you know, you do take into 

19 account that it's the middle of the night in a rural 

county and it's going to take two hours, but still 

21 think, well, that's the analysis you have to go through. 

22  MR. SHAPIRO: That is correct,

States in the country by our count, 26 States in the 

country that by statute have prohibited warrantless 

blood draws in routine DWI cases. They are listed on 

page 31 of the red brief in Footnote 9. 

Given that fact, in the face of that 

reality, I don't think Missouri can plausibly claim that 

a categorical rule that would then apply nationwide if 

this Court were to announce it in the context of this 

case, that warrants are never required in routine DWI 

cases, could satisfy the standard that this Court has 

established, namely that the exception to the warrant 

requirement that is being proposed serves law 

enforcement needs so compelling that a warrantless 

search is objectively reasonable in every case. 

There is no evidence that I am aware of, in 

response to Justice Kennedy's question, and there is 

certainly no evidence in the record in this case or in 

the briefs in this case that those 25 States that 

prohibit warrantless blood draws in the circumstances 

that my client confronted here have a lower conviction 

rate, are less concerned about drunk drivers --

JUSTICE BREYER: A lot of States have 

varying degrees to which they want to enforce strict 

rules against drunk driving. And a State -- that's 

exactly the kind of thing that worries me on your side.

The -- you have a bunch of States that don't -- you 

know, it's not easy to get hold of a magistrate in 

15 minutes or so forth. And so what to do about that? 

If you say, well, you don't have to because 

you haven't got it provided, you give them every 

incentive not to make the magistrate available. That's 

cutting in your favor. On the other hand, it's pretty 

tough to say that all these States have to have the best 

possible magistrate available 24 hours a day so somebody 

can call in ten instances a year because the guy won't 

take the blood test -- won't take the breathalyzer. 

And that's where I am in a dilemma. And so 

I'm looking for an answer to that. And you don't have 

an absolute rule or I don't see an absolute rule. 

Should you say, look, here's what you have to do, it's 

better to have a second opinion there, which is the 

magistrate's? 

And so on the way to the hospital, it's just 

that's where we started, you have to phone and try to 

get one, and if you don't have one by the time you're at 

the hospital, tell them again: It's your last chance, 

give us the breathalyzer or else. And he says no, 

then you take the blood test. Is that the solution, or 

do you have a better solution? What's the solution to 

the problem if you are willing to reject, which you

aren't, but hypothetically you might be, that there's 

the absolute rule. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, I would say several 

things. First of all, Your Honor, I really do have no 

reason to believe that there's any jurisdiction in the 

country at this point that is not deeply concerned about 

drunk driving, or recognizes that drunk driving is a 

serious problem. That is certainly not our position. 

Secondly, the reason I think that there is 

no evidence that in the States that prohibit warrantless 

blood draws in routine DWI cases like this have lower 

conviction rates is, number one, in most cases, they can 

obtain consent; number two, in cases where they can't 

obtain consent, they have been able to obtain warrants 

in a timely -- in a timely fashion; and number three, 

even in the absence of warrants, all the facts that lead 

to probable cause often create a very compelling case 

for conviction in the absence of the blood alcohol --

JUSTICE BREYER: My question is what you 

don't want to do and you don't have to, but if you think 

of a second-best solution it might always be better than 

what I think of as a second-best solution.

want to say anything that would suggest -- we have a 

number of them floating around and -- and I just wonder 

if you want to express any view on a second-best 

solution. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, well -- well, our -- our 

position, and I'm not sure whether you're classifying 

this as our first position or -- or something else --

our position is that within the context of Schmerber, if 

there are special facts external to the warrant 

requirement, then you have to apply a totality of the 

circumstances test, and you ought to apply a 

reasonableness standard. 

In the context of the delays that are 

intrinsic to the warrant requirement, absent and if any 

evidence that those intrinsic delays have interfered 

with the ability of 25 States in the country to enforce 

their drunk driving laws, this Court ought not to adopt 

a categorical exception to the -- to the warrant 

requirement. 

And the risk of doing it, as you pointed 

out, Justice Breyer, is then you create this odd 

disincentive, which is the States that have the most --

have the slowest and most cumbersome warrant procedures 

are the States that get a free pass and are able to 

override the Fourth Amendment. That seems to me -Â­

JUSTICE ALITO: That's not true because 

there's a great advantage to the prosecution in having a 

search with a warrant as opposed to a warrantless search 

in terms of suppression; isn't that correct? 

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, there is some advantage 

to having -- certainly, a search that is conducted 

pursuant to a warrant is much less subject to 

suppression than a search that is subject not pursuant 

to a warrant. But -- but there is generally speaking in 

these cases a probable cause that is derived from the 

officer's observations on the scene and the defendant's 

performance in the field sobriety test, that -- that --

you know, can support the warrant -- support -- support 

the search. 

But I think --

JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you this question? 

How much blood has to be taken in order to test for 

blood alcohol? What if medical technology advances 

to -- I gather it's a -- it's a substantial amount. But 

what if it advances to the point that you don't need any 

more blood than you need now to test blood sugar, and 

you just have a little machine that makes a tiny prick 

in somebody's finger and you've got enough blood to do a 

blood alcohol test. Does it change then?

don't think the Fourth Amendment rule turns on the 

amount of blood that you take out of somebody's body. 

think the Fourth -- an important, maybe not the 

important dividing line, an important dividing line for 

Fourth Amendment purposes is puncturing the skin, and 

the Court has recognized this in other circumstances. 

And I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So does that mean --

the last footnote in the Solicitor General's brief talks 

about some other methods, including a urine sample. Not 

as accurate as blood, but it can help achieve the same 

result. One of the things that I think affects the view 

in this case is it's a pretty scary image of somebody 

restrained, and -- you know, a representative of the 

State approaching them with a needle. But I take it you

about this device that you just sort of hold in front of 

that you don't have to blow up the balloon, you just hold 

it in front of the individual and it measures to some 

extent blood alcohol content, or at least whether the 

individual's been drinking? Surely you don't need a 

search warrant for that. 

MR. SHAPIRO: I think that -- I think that's 

probably -- I think that's probably correct, Your Honor. 

You presumably do not need a search warrant, a search 

warrant for that. And this Court held, first in 

Schmerber and then reaffirmed in South 

Dakota v. Neville, that there is no Fifth Amendment 

issue in requiring the defendant to produce the evidence 

that can then be used against you. So we know we're not 

talking about a self-incrimination problem; we're 

talking about a search and seizure problem. 

And if the government were able to obtain 

the evidence in a way that did not rise to the level of 

a search, then the warrant requirement wouldn't apply. 

But we are not there. We're not there. 

And -- and the -- the warrant process 

that -- that Missouri has described is -- is not as 

complicated. There are many places now that, number 

one, permit not only telephonic warrants but electronic

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're in an odd --

odd position to be making -- it's an understandable 

position -- your argument is these warrants are just 

easy as -- as pie. You just send in this thing, the 

judge does it in an instant, it doesn't take very long

protection of the Fourth Amendment to a far -- far

The idea is that the prosecuting attorney is 

supposed to spend some time looking at this before 

submitting it to the judge and the judge is supposed to 

spend some time examining it. But the idea that you're 

going to do these things in a half hour seems 

unreasonable to me. 

MR. SHAPIRO: But I don't think it's 

unreasonable, Your Honor, and it's because we all 

recognize that the evidence in these cases is relatively 

routinized, and the procedures are relatively 

standardized. But that does not mean there is not a 

value to the warrant process, and to the second look by 

a mutual and detached magistrate. And the value of --

go back to what in this conversation we sort of have 

lost focus of, which is the question presented, and 

which is the essence, I think, of your adversary's 

arguments. I'm not sure you've really put forth -- the 

essence of their argument is that you can forego the 

warrant requirement when you know for a fact that 

evidence is going to dissipate over time. 

Basically, they're saying this process 

undermines our right to get a warrant because the 

evidence is dissipating. We certainly have cases that 

talk about destruction of evidence being a reason to 

forego the warrant. What makes this case different from 

those? 

MR. SHAPIRO: I'd be happy to answer that 

question, Justice Sotomayor, if I could just complete my 

answer to the Chief Justice for one second. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Sure. 

MR. SHAPIRO: And my answer would be that 

even if there are boxes on a standardized form, there is 

value to making sure that the prosecutor and the police 

have checked off all the right boxes before they engage 

in a process as intrusive as putting a needle in 

somebody's arm. 

Now, in answer to Justice Sotomayor's

1 Your Honor. First, this Court has on two 

2 occasions considered and rejected the notion that the 

3 mere fact that alcohol dissipates over time is itself 

4 sufficient to proceed without a warrant. 

As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, in 

6 Schmerber, the Court's discussion of what the Court 

7 itself called special facts would have been unnecessary 

8 if all the Court needed to say was that this natural 

9 dissipation of alcohol in the blood automatically would 

lead to --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Shapiro, Schmerber is an 

12 odd case because Justice Ginsburg and you are exactly right, 

13 that they spend a lot of time talking about special 

14 facts, and particularly so, but then you read the 

opinion kind of backwards and forwards, and you can't 

16 find the special facts. 

17  MR. SHAPIRO: I think the special facts, 

18 Your Honor, were the accident and the injuries at the 

19 scene, which delayed the police for two hours before 

they could even get to the hospital and initiate the 

21 process of applying for a warrant, at a time when there 

22 were no cell phones, there were no faxes, there were no 

23 internets, and all warrant applications had to be 

24 presented in person. That's a very, very different

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, if they had sent more 

police officers to the scene, they could have done 

everything faster. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Excuse me? 

JUSTICE ALITO: If they had sent more police 

officers to the scene of the accident, if they -- then 

they could have done it faster. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Perhaps. 

JUSTICE ALITO: So what's the difference 

between that practical limitation and the limitation 

that exists in a world -- in a rural jurisdiction? 

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, I think that practical 

limitation, whether or not there were other officers on 

the scene, right, or that could have been sent to the 

scene, we're not asking for a rule in which this Court 

would direct police officers how they -- they ought to 

deploy their resources. If there are multiple police 

officers on the scene, I don't think it's unreasonable 

to say one can attend to the accident and the other one 

can search -- can search for a warrant, and that becomes 

part of the totality of the circumstances. But 

Schmerber is not the only case, Your Honor. 

In -- in Welsh v. Wisconsin, the Court 

expressly said that the mere dissipation of alcohol in 

the blood was not sufficient to justify a warrantless

entry into a defendant's home in order to arrest the 

defendant on DWI charges. It's explicit holding, it's 

not simply an inference that one has to draw from 

Schmerber. 

The second thing I would say in response to 

your question, Justice Sotomayor, is -- is -- is 

biology. And that it is true that alcohol dissipates 

over time through natural body processes. But that's 

only after the blood alcohol level has reached its peak, 

and that is generally about half an hour after somebody 

has had his last drink. So there is a period of time in 

which the blood -- the body is continuing to absorb 

alcohol and then -- and the blood alcohol level is 

continuing to rise. Only at peak does it then start to 

dissipate. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry, 

what's the relevance of that? 

MR. SHAPIRO: The relevance of that is that 

it is not true that in every -- it won't be true in 

every case, Mr. Chief Justice, that the State is losing 

evidence with each passing moment. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it depends upon 

when the last -- if a person left the restaurant right 

after they had a nightcap and then left, but if they 

just had drinks before, I mean, the problem seems to be

there in either case. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't know when 

the person's last drink was. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, you may or may not know, 

depending upon what the -- the person is willing to tell 

you. All I'm saying is that in every case, in every 

case, it's not the situation that from the moment you 

stop the driver, his blood alcohol level is going down. 

There will be some cases where it is going up. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I am probably just -- but a 

policeman has probable cause to believe that somebody 

inside the house has drugs. He hears the toilet 

flushing and he thinks they're flushing the drugs down 

the drain. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: He doesn't have to get a 

warrant as long as he reasonably believes that the 

evidence is disappearing. All right. Now, the 

difference between your case here and that is 

specifically what? Suppose we were just to refer to 

those cases --

MR. SHAPIRO: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- and say it's the same 

thing.

MR. SHAPIRO: Because the process is a very 

different process. In the typical drug case, which is 

what this Court has considered when it has examined the 

question of whether the destruction of evidence 

qualifies as an exigent circumstance, that question has 

almost always arisen in what I'll call a typical drug 

case, Richards v. Wisconsin, Kentucky v. King. And in 

those situations, what the Court is worried about is 

that the suspect inside the house is going to flush the 

drugs down the toilet. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What you're saying is if 

it's now or never --

MR. SHAPIRO: It is now or --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- where the other is a 

slow process. 

MR. SHAPIRO: It is now or never and not 

only is it now or never, that -- but in most of those 

cases, probably not all, but in most of the cases, the 

State's case is going to disappear down the drain along 

with the drugs and the ability to destroy the drugs lies 

entirely within the control of the defendant. The 

defendant gets to decide whether he's going to put the 

drugs down the toilet or not and when he does, the 

destruction is immediate and total. 

In this situation, the process is gradual.

It takes hours. It can take hours, depending upon how 

much alcohol is -- is in the system and it is outside 

the control of the suspect. There is nothing that the 

suspect can do to expedite the process of the 

destruction of evidence. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we -- we know the 

defense attorneys love it when there's a delay because 

then the retrograde analysis has more and more 

contingencies that make it unreliable. 

MR. SHAPIRO: That may be -- that may --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, you'd much rather 

examine the State's expert if the sample was taken three 

hours than if it were -- after the arrest than one. 

mean, that's a given. 

MR. SHAPIRO: There is -- there is -- there 

is no doubt, Justice Kennedy, first of all, the 

retrograde extrapolation evidence, which is now being 

considered in various courts around the country is 

controversial. It's subject to cross-examination. You 

know -- the -- we haven't resolved whether -- whether 

the state of that -- the state of that -- the state of 

that evidence yet. But having said that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought -- I thought you 

would also distinguish the drug flush cases on -- on the

somewhat less than violation of the integrity of your 

body. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, I think that that is 

certainly -- that is certainly true -- that is certainly 

true as well, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that goes into the 

reasonableness determination. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Right. And there -- and there 

is no doubt, I will not deny, the State's case will be 

easier if it does not have to obtain a warrant, but this 

case -- Court has recognized that many times in the 

past. Criminal investigations are always easier if the 

State does not have to comply with the warrant process. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shapiro, before your 

time runs out, the case of the fingernail --

MR. SHAPIRO: Mm-hmm. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- scrapings has been 

raised as saying well, that's -- somebody is going to 

scrape your fingernails, that's as intrusive as a blood 

test. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, I would say three 

things, Your Honor. I don't think it is as intrusive, 

although even in Cupp v. Murphy, which is that case, the 

Court described it as a serious, but brief intrusion on 

the cherished value of personal security. The Court

recognized that even the -- the fingernail scrape was --

was a serious Fourth Amendment issue. 

Secondly, that evidence, unlike the blood 

alcohol evidence, was under the control of the defendant 

and in that case, on the facts of that case, much like 

many of the Court's other exigent circumstances cases, 

there was evidence that suggests that the defendant was 

actively engaged in the process of degrading the 

evidence at the time that the police stepped in and said 

we're going to preserve what is left rather than allow 

you to be the agent of your own destruction. 

And as the Court said in Kentucky v. King, 

it is a very different situation when you have the 

defendant himself destroying evidence. Under those 

circumstances, it may be reasonable for the Court to say 

you can't simultaneously destroy evidence and then 

protest that the destruction of the evidence -- evidence 

has created the exigency that requires the State to act 

without a warrant. But there is no agency in this case 

on behalf of the defendant. The defendant has no 

capacity. 

And I come back to what I said before. It 

is true, I think this question came -- came up earlier, 

when Mr. Koester was being -- was being questioned. 

Fourth Amendment standards are not determined by State

1 law. The Court has said that in Virginia v. Moore. We 

2 all understand that. But in the determination of what 

3 is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, this Court has 

4 often looked to State practices in response to 

Justice Kennedy's question. 

6  In Tennessee v. Garner, you have the Court 

7 say half the States have abrogated the Common Law Rule 

8 that would have allowed the police to shoot any felon --

9 fleeing felon. In Richards v. Wisconsin, you have half 

the States that did not support an exception to the No Knock 

11 Rule. Here we have half the States in the country that 

12 would not have permitted what went on in this case.

that the closer a chemical test is taken to the time of 

21 driving, the more reliable the evidence of intoxication 

22 is, the more reliable the evidence of impairment is. 

23  So under the Respondent's approach, it would 

24 be mandated that we're going to allow the most reliable
