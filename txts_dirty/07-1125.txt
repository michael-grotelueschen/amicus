 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you. If it please the 

Court:

 The court of appeals in this case -- excuse 

me, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you raise the 

podium?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Actually, I have never used 

this before, so it's a learning experience for me, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's enough.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Okay.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: We can't see you.

 MR. ROTHFIELD: That -- that may be an 

advantage, Your Honor.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we can hear you.

 MR. ROTHFELD: If -- if I should modify it,

please -- please let me know.

 The court of appeals in this case made two 

fundamental and separate errors, each of which should 

require reversal of its decision. First, all agree that 

the question whether Title IX precludes the use of 

Section 1983 to enforce the Constitution is a matter of 

congressional intent. Yet, the court of appeals 

entirely disregarded all of the ordinary indicia of 

congressional intent: The statutory text, the statutory 

background structure and evolution, the unquestioned 

legislative purpose.

 Each of these considerations points 

conclusively towards a single outcome: Congress did not 

mean Title IX to preclude the use of Section 1983 to 

enforce the Constitution.

 Second, rather than consider any of this 

direct and compelling evidence of what Congress actually 

had in mind in Title IX, the court of appeals applied 

what it thought to be a presumption that the 

availability of Title IX's implied right of action to 

enforce Title IX's own statutory prohibition of gender 

discrimination somehow should be taken to mean that 

Congress meant to preclude the use of Section 1983 to 

enforce constitutional rules against discrimination.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, there is --

there is a little bit of an air of unreality about all 

this, because, of course, Congress didn't provide a 

cause of action in Title IX to start with. And the 

reason they don't have all these limitations and 

restrictions is because they didn't put in the cause of 

action.

 We implied it from the statute, and so it 

seems kind of awkward to say: Well, there are no 

limitations, as I said, when there was no cause of 

action.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I guess there --

there are a number of points that I -- I can make in 

response to that, Your Honor. First of all, I think 

what -- what you say is absolutely right. Congress did 

not expressly provide a cause of action in Title IX.

 And so since -- since the question in a 

preclusion case, the question whether or not Congress 

meant to preclude the use of Section 1983, is whether 

there is a clear indication of congressional intent to 

do so, that there -- as a matter of definition, that 

can't be present here. But -- but before --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe the question ought to 

be whether this Court intended to have the Title IX 

action which it invented preclude 1983. Why don't we 

look to the intent of this Court?

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I think not, Your 

Honor. I think that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you agree that this 

Court invented the cause of action?

 MR. ROTHFELD: No, I -- I don't agree with 

that. I -- I do think -- and -- and I -- this is not my 

principal point, but I do think it's quite clear that if 

we are talking about what is the clear intent of 

Congress regarding preclusion of use of Section 1983, 

that the Congress did not expressly create a -- a 

private right of action at all bears very significantly 

on that.

 I don't at all disagree that Congress 

intended and expected that the courts would recognize 

the right of action under -- under Title IX. But 

Congress actually in Title IX specifically I think 

addressed the preclusion question that we have here.

 There is a clear statutory test that answers 

the question in this case in -- in several respects. 

First of all, when Congress enacted Title IX, it 

specifically provided that -- it specifically 

contemplated that there would be continued, private 

constitutional litigation challenging -- to end 

discrimination.

 It specifically authorized the attorney

general to intervene in private litigation "whenever" --

and I am here quoting from the text of the statute --

"whenever suit is initiated in any court of the United 

States to assert rights, deprivation of equal 

protection, under the Fourteenth Amendment of the 

Constitution on account of sex."

 Congress, therefore, specifically 

contemplated when it enacted Title IX that there would 

be -- there would, in fact, be constitutional litigation 

challenging gender discrimination on account of sex. 

And Congress surely knew that that litigation would 

proceed under Section 1983. Respondents --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did we rely on that 

provision in implying the right of action under Title 

IX?

 MR. ROTHFELD: The -- the Court did not. I 

mean there, the -- the Court looked at what it took to 

be the general -- the manifest congressional intent when 

-- when it enacted Title IX. But it did not 

specifically rely on -- on that legislation. The 

legislation, of course, goes to whether or not Section 

1983 suits were available, not whether there is a Title 

IX implied right of action available.

 And, as I say, in that -- in that 

legislative language Congress made expressly clear that

it intended -- and intended actually to facilitate by 

allowing the attorney general to intervene in --

continued Section 1983 litigation to enforce allegations 

of -- of gender discrimination.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rothfeld, I follow 

your argument entirely, and then in the civil rights 

area there are a lot of overlapping statutes. You can 

sue under Title VII. It doesn't take away your right 

under 1981.

 But in this case, as we get down to what 

this case is about, we have a determination by a court 

that the school district acted reasonably in relation to 

these complaints. And then you say: But we have 

constitutional claim. A constitutional claim requires 

you to show deliberate, intentional conduct if it's an 

individual; if you are talking about an institution, 

some kind of not just one incident, but a custom, a 

pattern.

 What, when you get down to the merits, is 

different about those? In other words, is it on the 

wrong track to talk about precluding a statute? Instead 

of talking about just plain old issue preclusion, what 

is different about 1983?

 Yes, you have two claims; but if you lose 

under IX, you are going to lose under 1983 as well.

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, that -- that is right, 

Your Honor, to the extent that the claims are identical 

and that they have actually been adjudicated.

 The -- the First Circuit in this case 

resolved the Title IX claim focusing on deliberate 

indifference in response to the peer-on-peer sexual 

harassment. To the extent that there is a federal 

constitutional claim growing out of that conduct of the 

same sort and to the extent that the elements of that 

claim are identical, then we agree that at that point 

that would be precluded. But we think that there is 

more to this case than that one issue that has been 

resolved.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What more? What more is 

alleged in the complaint? I thought the complaint just 

spoke about deliberate indifference.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I guess there are 

-- are two points in -- in response to that, Your Honor. 

First of all, I think that the complaint can be taken to 

allege in addition more generic --

(Banging sound.)

 MR. ROTHFELD: I hope I am not responsible 

for that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will give you an 

extra ten seconds.

MR. ROTHFELD: And I -- I assure you I will 

-- I will use them, Your Honor.

 The -- the complaint, we think, should be 

taken also to be generally in response to complaints of 

-- of misconduct by individuals within the school, but 

in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Spell that out -- spell 

that out practically. I know you used --

MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think -- for example, 

Your Honor, we think that one thing that -- that could 

be developed and explored further is disparate treatment 

of complaints; for example, the treatment of 

complaints of bullying by boys more favorably perhaps 

than by girls, believing testimony of boys rather than 

believing testimony of girls.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there was no 

allegation at all of that kind in this complaint.

 MR. ROTHFELD: I -- I -- I agree that that 

was not set out specifically in the complaint. The 

complaint did say in a -- in a general sense that 

Jacqueline Fitzgerald was denied equal access to the 

benefits of education. It says that the discrimination 

she suffered included but was not limited to sexual 

harassment. It asked for relief, injunctive relief, to 

bar unconstitutional treatment not only of Jacqueline

Fitzgerald but of all female students in the school, 

which I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, could you have 

brought a claim that they didn't let the female students 

play hockey under your complaint? I mean, that's 

additional discrimination.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: Didn't it have to be 

related to the particular facts?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Yes, that's right. I 

think --

JUSTICE BREYER: And you talked about you 

wanted some additional discovery. What? What is it 

that you could go to a district judge now and say, 

Judge, I have a basis here for asking for discovery on a 

different but related theory? What words would you use? 

What would you write in that request?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, there are a number of 

points I should make in response to that, Your Honor. I 

think one is, just as a general matter, we think that 

that's something -- this entire set of questions are 

things that are better resolved by the courts of 

appeals -- on -- the court of appeals on remand. I 

think that there are -- there are unresolved 

constitutional --

JUSTICE BREYER: The reason I ask is 

obviously if this case happens to be a case in which, 

because of the finding that there was no intentional 

discrimination and the school board behaved properly, 

that if that's the finding and therefore you have no 

claim under 1983 in respect to that, it becomes very 

theoretical to say that they went too far and said you 

might have no other 1983 claim because you would have 

some other 1983 claim, but we should dismiss this as 

improvidently granted and wait until somebody does this 

again.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, certainly -- I --

certainly, I understand that suggestion, Justice Breyer. 

And let me give you two responses to that. First a 

specific response to why it could happen on remand. 

This is not a theoretical possibility. There was 

actually discovery that was requested concerning 

additional complaints, concerning additional 

disciplinary action against other students, concerning 

requests for bus monitors, as to which could have been 

developed that there was disparate treatment as to 

those. The Respondents declined --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I still don't follow. 

What disparate treatment? Did you have to have that 

they treated girl's complaints one way and boy's

complaints another way?

 MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that would be one way 

in which --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And as far as this record 

shows, there has just been this one incident of 

harassment.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Again, Your Honor, I think 

one of the problems is that this case sort of went off 

the tracks at the earliest possible stage, at the -- at 

the time this motion for dismissal was granted. And it 

could have developed in quite a different way.

 For example, discovery was requested on 

these subjects that I -- that I mentioned to Justice 

Breyer, which -- which could have been used to develop 

that, in fact, requests by boys were treated more 

favorably than requests by girls; complaints by boys 

were responded to more -- more favor --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that request here in the 

record?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Excuse me, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is that request here?

 MR. ROTHFELD: The discovery request?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Do I have the request in 

the joint -- in the a -- do I have it in the appendix 

here?

MR. ROTHFELD: No. No. It --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, we don't have it in 

front of us?

 MR. ROTHFELD: You do not have it in front 

of you. But I can tell you that the request was made, 

the Respondents declined to respond it to it for, among 

other reasons, the -- their assertion that it would not 

lead to the discovery of relevant evidence or admissible 

evidence. After the 1983 conclusion ruling, and because 

of the conclusion ruling, that was not followed up 

because it would have been futile to try to develop 

additional argumentation in that -- in that direction.

 Had the case not hopped the track at this 

point, if the complaint could have amended -- could have 

been amended, additional individual defendants could 

have been added, the case could have gone on in quite a 

different direction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Rothfeld, we were -- we 

were warned about all these problems in the brief in 

opposition, weren't we?

 MR. ROTHFELD: That is correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Didn't that focus almost 

entirely upon the fact that there is no 1983 cause of 

action anyway?

 MR. ROTHFELD: That is exactly --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And we nonetheless 

granted -- granted cert?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Precisely the same arguments 

that were made in almost identical language in the brief 

in opposition are now being made as an argument as to 

why this Court should decide the merits of the 1983 

claim or dismiss as improvidently granted.

 The Court -- I don't presume to tell the 

Court what it was thinking when it granted review of the 

case, but it did presumably reject those arguments at 

that point, and there is no reason that they are any 

additional basis now.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What I understand, Mr. 

Rothfeld, that if you win on the question presented, you 

would agree that the -- the arguments the other side 

makes on this, on whether there's a cause of action 

under equal protection and so forth, that would remain 

open on remand?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And you may still lose the 

lawsuit even if you win here?

 MR. ROTHFELD: That is -- that is absolutely 

correct. The constitutional arguments were made on the 

merits to the district court and to the court of 

appeals. They were not addressed by either. Those

courts cut it short and threw the case out on conclusion 

grounds.

 And I -- I think the way in which the court 

of appeals decided the case actually suggests that it 

was of the view that there was more to the case than 

simply the Title IX claims that had been rejected, 

because one would have thought that if the court of 

appeals was of the view that there is nothing to the 

case beyond the Title IX peer-on-peer harassment claim 

that has been reject, it would have ended its discussion 

at that point. It would have said: We reject your 

Title IX claim; there is nothing more to your 1983 

constitutional claim; that's the end of the matter.

 But it didn't do that. It decided the Title 

IX claim on the merits, rejecting it. And it then 

separately went on to address the Section 1983 

constitutional claim and said: We are not going to 

address those merits at all; we are going to say that 

those claims are precluded as a matter of per se Title 

IX law, that Title IX is preclusive. And, therefore, 

one would think that the court of appeals had it in mind 

that there was more that could have been decided about 

the merits --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we find that out on 

remand.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What you're saying is 

they made a basic legal error.

 MR. ROTHFELD: That's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You may have a losing 

case under 1983, but let the First Circuit decide that?

 MR. ROTHFELD: That -- that is absolutely 

correct. That is our --

JUSTICE BREYER: How do we know that the 

First Circuit wasn't just thinking about the facts of 

this case in front of it when it said that there's no 

1983 action. I mean, they didn't think there was no 

1983 action for search and seizure. They must have had 

some idea of what the limitations of their saying no --

no -- no 1983 action was. So why do we know that they 

went beyond what they had in front of them in this case? 

I'm not saying they didn't? I am just wanting to know 

what we -- how we know that?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I think one of the 

problems is, of course, we don't know for sure what --

what they were thinking, and therefore, it makes sense 

to think that this Court, in the regular course of its 

practice could decide the question presented and to send 

the case back down to the lower courts --

words, but it's whether the Title IX replaces the --

what is it, it's whether -- I'm sorry. You have it 

right in front of you there.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Whether Title IX precludes 

the assertion of constitutional claims for gender 

discrimination in schools under section 1983. The --

the -- the reason that I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: You think they're --

they're referring to all of Title IX, no matter what the 

claims, whether they are overlapping or not?

 MR. ROTHFELD: I think that that is the 

language that the First Circuit uses. The First Circuit 

says, in so many words, that Title IX is the exclusive 

avenue for the assertion of claims of gender 

discrimination arising out of -- arising from schools.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, because they were 

relying on case where we did say that a very detailed 

scheme was pre-emptive?

 MR. ROTHFELD: They were relying on one case 

in which the Court said that, in Smith v. Robinson, the 

only time in 140 years that Section 1983 has been on the 

books that this Court has ever said that Congress meant 

to preclude its use to enforce a particular

constitutional right. And I think --

you could use 1983, then the very elaborate mechanism 

that Congress had set up, who would use it?

 MR. ROTHFELD: That's -- that's absolutely 

right. But I -- I -- I add parenthetically that 

Congress promptly responded to the Court's decision in 

Smith by restoring the remedy --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Just on that one issue on 

attorneys' fees.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that the 

language used is actually broader in the -- in the --

legislation. But that, as I said, is a parenthetical 

point.

 I -- I think that something that we have 

here which was not present in Smith at all -- and as you 

said, Justice Ginsburg, it is absolutely right that 

there was a much more elaborate, involved administrative 

remedial scheme in the statute considered there, there 

is nothing remotely like that in Title IX. But before 

you could even get to that point, there is this 

expressed evidence in the statutory text of Title IX 

that Congress did not mean to preclude. This is Section 

1983.

 First there is the provision that I

mentioned regarding the attorney general, which -- which 

expressly contemplates there will be continued Section 

1983 constitutional gender discrimination after the 

enactment of Title IX. I think that in and of itself 

was positive and tells the Court all it needs to know.

 But beyond -- there is -- there is more. 

Beyond that, there is the language of the 

antidiscrimination provisions of Title IX, which was 

borrowed directly, is identical to the language of Title 

VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Congress dropped 

the phrase "race, color and national origin" that 

appears in Title VI and substituted "sex" in Title IX.

 And, so, the Court has recognized that 

Congress expected and intended that Title IX would be 

interpreted just as -- as had been Title VI.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have there been any 

decisions on Title VI and 1983?

 MR. ROTHFELD: There -- there had been a 

myriad of such decisions. There had been, as we cite in 

our brief, as the American Bar Association cites in its 

amicus brief supporting us, the American Civil Liberties 

Union cites in its brief, there have been almost two 

dozen cases decided before the enactment of Title IX in 

which courts allowed the simultaneous assertion of 

statutory discrimination claims under Title VI and

section 1983 discrimination claims under Title IX. 

There had not been a single suggestion by any decision 

that there might possibly be preclusion. And so, at the 

time that Congress used the language of Title IX, it 

knew that that language had been uniformly, widely 

construed across the country to allow the simultaneous 

assertion of those claims, not the preclusion of Section 

1983 claims for discrimination.

 And so it's when Congress -- when 

legislative language has been the subject of judicial 

construction, as the Court has said many times, and 

Congress repeats that language in a new statute, its 

expectation and intention is that the judicial 

construction is going to be taken as well.

 And so that I think that is also dispositive 

of the question in this case, because the Congress chose 

language that it necessarily knew had been understood 

not to preclude the use of Section 1983.

 And I will mention as well, just to throw in 

the suspenders along with the belt, an additional 

consideration that the court of appeals ignored here was 

the manifest legislative purpose of section -- of Title 

IX, which was to expand and strengthen protections 

against discrimination in schools.

Title IX is Spending Clause legislation, and that, under 

our precedents, imposes certain limitations on how we 

interpret it that would not be applicable under Section 

1983.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Absolutely correct. And I 

think that there are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the point is 

that that would then allow 1983 actions to circumvent 

those limitations on the Title IX remedy.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I -- I think not, for a 

couple of reasons, Your Honor. First, as I say, there 

is this direct evidence of what Congress had in mind. 

It specifically referred to constitutional litigation 

under the Fourteenth Amendment when it enacted Title IX, 

and, therefore, by definition it could not have been 

concerned about evasion in that sense. But I think that 

their -- "evasion" is not the word to use here because, 

on the one hand, there are statutory rights created by 

Title IX; on the other, there are pre-existing 

constitutional rights.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And those constitutional 

rights have negated -- I think it might be -- it's at 

least arguable that it would be harder to win a 1983 

case, given that, as to the individual, you have 

qualified immunity, and, as to the institution, you have

to show a custom or practice.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, the only availability 

for individual liability is under the Constitution, 

because Title IX, at least as construed by the lower 

courts, does not permit suits directly against the 

individual, only against the institution, which I think 

is a significant distinction between the two and 

supports the argument that Congress could not have 

intended to preclude because, as the Court has 

recognized repeatedly, the availability of individual 

liability greatly adds to the deterrence, the effect of 

deterring constitutional violations.

 And the suggestion that, when Congress 

enacted Title IX it would have -- meant to have the 

perverse effect of allowing a school, by accepting 

federal funds, to insulate school policymakers from any 

personal statutory liability, you know, for even the 

most blatant and obvious acts of unconstitutional sex 

discrimination, would turn Title IX on its head. It's 

inconceivable that Congress could have had that in mind 

when it enacted a statute that was clearly designed to 

expand and strength protections against sex 

discrimination.

 I'll make sort of two additional points, 

Your Honor. As I suggest, I think the direct evidence

in the statutory text, as well as the legislative 

purpose, is dispositive here and the Court need not go 

beyond that to answer the question here. That leaves 

the question of how the court of appeals got the matter 

so far wrong. And I think that the reason that they did 

is, ignoring the text, they applied what they thought to 

be a presumption derived from this Court's decision in 

cases like Smith v. Robinson and the Palos Verdes case 

that the creation of a new statutory right and a new 

statutory remedy necessarily reflects a congressional 

intent to preclude the use of Section 1983 to enforce 

overlapping constitutional remedies. There has never 

been such a presumption.

 The Court has said repeatedly, I think, as 

was suggested earlier in the discussion, that when 

Congress creates new statutory rights and new statutory 

remedies, they are presumed to overlap with and to 

supplement existing statutory rights and remedies, 

unless the two are positively repugnant to one another, 

unless they are inconsistent and can't be reconciled. 

That certainly is not the case here. The Section 1983 

constitutional claims and Title IX supplement and 

complement each other. The two statutes are by no means 

coterminous in who can be sued.

 The Court has certainly never presumed that

the creation of any statutory right or statutory remedy 

bars the use of Section 1983 to enforce the 

Constitution, as suggested by Justice Ginsburg's 

question. The Court has only once in well more than a 

century that Section 1983 has been on the books held 

that availability of the constitutional remedy had been 

precluded. As I say, Congress promptly responded by 

providing that remedy.

 The Palos Verdes decision, which was the 

fulcrum of the court of appeals decision, I think 

suggests what's wrong with its analysis. Palos Verdes 

involved a new statutory right, a new statutory action 

to enforce that right. The statutory action was limited 

in significant respects, and the Court concluded, as a 

matter of common sense, that one could infer from that 

situation Congress intended that the new right with the 

new remedial system would be exclusive, otherwise 

plaintiffs could immediately go to court and render that 

system a dead letter.

 But, as Justice Scalia pointed out in his 

opinion for the Court, that remedy had no effect 

whatsoever on section 1983. It meant that Congress had 

placed the new remedy outside of section 1983's remedial 

framework, but that claims that were available prior to 

the existence of that new right, prior to the creation

of that new right, remained available under section 

1983. And that is exactly the situation that we have 

here. Plaintiffs are not trying to allege a new 

statutory right that is outside the section 1983's 

remedial framework; instead, they are asserting 

fundamental, pre-existing constitutional rights.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I take it they don't 

have to bring these actions together. They can sue 

under Title IX; if they lose, then they can start a 

whole new lawsuit under 1983?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that to the 

extent -- as was suggested by Justice Ginsburg's point 

in questioning, to the extent that the claims are the 

same, then they would preclude it. If the 1983 has the 

same elements, the same cause of action, it --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It would be a different 

claim, but there would be issue preclusion.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Issue preclusion. That's 

right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if you have 

different -- I guess would you have a different set of 

defendants, right? You would have the school in the 

Title IX case, the individuals in the 1983 action?

Title IX for a type of claim that could have been 

brought as a parallel claim against the individual under 

section 1983, and the Title IX claim was rejected, to 

the extent that the elements are the same, presumably 

there would be a defense of collateral estoppel.

Clause. Therefore, having Title IX preclude section 

1983 Equal Protection claims does not deny petitioners 

in this or any other case availability --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you go over that 

again? I didn't understand it. You said Title IX 

provides --

MS. HODGE: Title IX --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- against sex 

discrimination than the Constitution does.

 MS. HODGE: Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Explain that to me.

 MS. HODGE: The Title IX prohibits 

discrimination on the basis of sex. The Equal 

Protection Clause or section 1983 and the Equal 

Protection Clause require that additional intentional 

discrimination that this Court found in Personnel 

Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney. We would 

suggest to the Court that Title IX actually covers a 

broad range of circumstances that may not involve that 

very specific intent required to perfect a 

constitutional violation. And clearly -- if you look at 

the cases, the cases clearly involve a variety of 

instances which would not be sufficient under, say, a 

constitutional evaluation.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Give me an example.

MS. HODGE: An example would be the 

situation such as this particular situation. We are 

told this is a case of peer-on-peer, student-on-student 

harassment. In this situation, the standard as decided 

by this Court in Davis is deliberate indifference.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what would the 

standard be under 1983?

 MS. HODGE: The standard under 1983 is also 

deliberate indifference, but it requires then that the 

deliberate indifference be shown to be not just the act 

of a school administrator who does not do what they 

should do in order to pursue a particular complaint; 

but, rather, there needs to be the specific intent to 

discriminate or -- or specific intent to choose boys 

over girls or girls over boys in that decisionmaking 

process.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but if you lose under 

-- under Title IX, a fortiori, you would lose under the 

Constitution, I would think.

 MS. HODGE: I -- I believe -- and that is, 

in essence, the position that the Barnstable School 

Committee and Superintendent Debra are arguing in this 

case; that is, that because deliberate indifference is 

the standard that is applicable both under Title IX and 

also under the Constitution, that it is -- it is --

having lost the issue of deliberate indifference before 

the First Circuit, that finding of the First Circuit 

precludes any further controversy between the parties in 

this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they didn't go on the 

issue of preclusion. If they had done that, it would be 

a different case.  They said that Title IX is preemptive 

of 1983. And they cited the cases where -- like Smith 

against Robinson where that is what the Court held.

 MS. HODGE: I believe, Your Honor, that we 

have a situation in which you have both claim 

preclusion -- both preclusion under Smith v. Robinson as 

well as issue preclusion, which makes it somewhat 

complicated. But I would suggest in this case under 

these circumstances, because the issue was deliberate 

indifference and because there was a finding both as a 

legal matter as well as a factual matter of deliberate 

indifference, that essentially the two sort of collapsed 

into one.

 With regard to Smith, I would point out that 

under the Smith theory constitutional claims can be 

precluded if the -- under the statute under review it 

has comprehensive, remedial schemes. And we would argue 

that there is a comprehensive remedial scheme, and that 

this Court has, in fact, sort of found that and even

added to it in the development -- have found that 

Congress intended to add to the remedial scheme an 

implied right of action.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you must, I 

think, recognize that the elaborate scheme that Congress 

set up under the Education of the Handicapped Act is 

quite different from what this Court did. It just said 

there is a private right -- right of action. There is 

an implied private right of action.

 It didn't set up any administrative 

mechanism. It didn't set up any regime for going to --

to an agency first and then coming to the court, none of 

that.

 MS. HODGE: There is not. But I would 

suggest that that is appropriate under the 

circumstances. And I would also suggest that there is, 

in fact, an administrative scheme. The regulations 

that, in fact -- that have been promulgated by the 

Office of Civil Rights and the Department of Education, 

in fact, have a number of prerequisites and 

requirements. They impose upon --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are not arguing 

that the agency regulations have the effect of 

precluding the 1983 action.

scheme leads to the potential loss of federal funding --

JUSTICE BREYER: Are you saying -- are you

a institution that is receiving Federal assistance, 

okay? And we also imagine that somebody is claiming 

that on the basis of gender they have been excluded from 

participating in, or denied the benefit of, or have been 

subject to discrimination.

 Are you saying that it is impossible for 

anyone to imagine a circumstance in which it would be 

held the defendant did not violate Title IX, but in 

which the court held it did violate the Equal Protection 

Clause? There is no such circumstance; no one can 

imagine one. Is that what you are saying?

 MS. HODGE: Your Honor, what I am saying is 

I cannot imagine one. And I don't believe --

And you think no one can imagine one. So the obvious 

question on rebuttal is, since we have limited it to

MS. HODGE: I believe that that is true.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's simple.

 MS. HODGE: And I would point out that in 

response to the Petitioners' argument today, they have 

attempted to suggest that there may be some issues that 

were not discovered; that were not, in fact, fully 

reviewed by the court below.

 And I suggest that the First Circuit did, in 

fact, look at specifically that issue. And the First 

Circuit said in their decision that, in looking at the 

equal protection claim in particular, that the 

petitioners offer -- or in that case, they offer, the 

plaintiffs offer -- no theory of liability under the 

equal protection clause other than the defendants' 

supposed failure to take adequate actions to prevent 

and/or remediate the peer-on-peer harassment that 

Jacqueline experienced.

 And I suggest to you that that is exactly 

the issue that -- that that is exactly the issue. The 

issue is whether or not, if you look at the complaint, 

the claim that is being brought under Title IX and the 

claim that is being brought under Section 1983 in the 

Constitution are virtually identical, which is a second 

problem of the Smith test: If there is a comprehensive 

remedial scheme. Again, it's a remedial scheme.

And, second, the question is: Are the 

claims virtually identical? And I would suggest to you 

that the First Circuit found that they were virtually 

identical. And I would suggest that that is what leads 

to preclusion.

 Now, that doesn't mean that there aren't 

other claims that could be made with regard to others. 

But for the institution, it -- I -- the -- it is very 

important. Congress established this particular scheme 

under Section 19 -- under Title IX, and it would be our 

view that Congress specifically and intentionally 

focused -- fixed the responsibility for sex 

discrimination on the institution and on the 

institutional recipient of Federal financial assistance.

 And that if you were to allow Section 1983 

claims, that enforcement would not be nearly as 

equitable. We would point out that it's obvious, but it 

is important to consider that recipients of Federal 

financial assistance include not only municipalities 

that include public schools; they include State entities 

which under this Court's decision -- under this Court's 

prior decision in Wills versus Michigan are not subject 

to suit under Section 1983 and private entities that are 

not subject to 1983 at all.

claim violate section -- Title IX?

 MS. HODGE: There -- there --it is not 100 

percent clear except for the following, and I would 

suggest this: Title IX prohibits discrimination. If it 

were determined that a policy or other practice led to a 

denial of equal access to the benefits in -- in -- and 

participatory activities of an individual student based 

on their gender, I believe it is covered; and I believe 

it is discrimination; and I believe it is prohibited.

 And the fact of the matter is, though, that 

under the law as developed by this Court and the Equal 

Protection Cause, the fact of the matter is that it 

would not cover disparate impact, because this Court has 

held that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you have any case in 

all of Title IX that -- that fits that abstract picture 

that you have just described? I mean you have to have a 

pattern and practice of what -- a pattern and practice 

of discrimination -- to get -- to get under the 

Constitution or under 1983?

 You have to have deliberate indifference to 

what: To the gender harassment, to the gender 

discrimination? So can you describe to me that --

anything, any Title IX case, that has a disparate 

impact? We really didn't want a Feeney type of case.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you describe a Title 

IX case that's like Feeney in that respect where we 

didn't want this diverse impact to occur; we really 

didn't want it at all, but it happened?

 MS. HODGE: I believe that the fact that it 

happened is sufficient discrimination to come under 

Title IX. I would point out to Your Honor that the 

Cannon case, in fact, involved essentially the -- a 

disparate-impact type case. It dealt with admissions 

policies and the effect of the admissions policies on 

individuals.

 And, consequently, I believe that it is not 

ethereal. It is quite real. But the difference is that 

the question becomes one of whether or not an 

individual, based on their gender, is being denied the 

benefits of, and participation in, available --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: On the basis of gender.

 MS. HODGE: On the basis of gender -- on the 

basis of gender, but I don't believe the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And Feeney says it wasn't

wasn't a veteran.

MS. HODGE: But you see, I believe that the 

impact, which would have been an individual would not 

have been allowed to participate, may be an additive 

factual conclusion which would go to the general 

discrimination issue. The position that -- the argument 

we are making to this Court includes the fact that since 

Title IX is as broad, if not broader, and I would 

suggest the following through a visual picture.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is -- you are 

leaving out something quite glaring in that respect. 

For example, single sex schools, military academies, 

admissions to elementary and high schools, are not 

covered by Title IX.

 MS. HODGE: Oh, you are absolutely correct, 

Your Honor, and under those circumstances, we would 

suggest that as this Court found in Mississippi v Hogan, 

that those institutions would then be subject to section 

1983 review, but on the highly constitutional standard 

which requires intentional discrimination; and second of 

all, we believe that that is -- that Mississippi is an 

illustration of the reason why the argument of 

Petitioner regarding 2000h of Title IX, which deals with 

the fact that -- that when they passed Title IX, they 

also reserve the opportunity for the Attorney General to 

become involved in a case under 1983, that the intention

of that language was not necessarily to preserve 1983 in 

cases against recipients who are in fact covered, but it 

would have been to reserve the right of the Attorney 

General to -- to intervene in cases in which either the 

institution was not covered -- because you are 

absolutely right, there are institutions which are not 

covered -- and as you decided in Mississippi v Hogan, 

they would be subject to section 1983; and/or 

individuals that the First Circuit recognized might, 

because they -- if they are -- if they are State actors, 

that is not the case you have here, which was 

peer-on-peer harassment -- but if you is had a situation 

where for example, a teacher or an administrator was in 

fact the alleged harasser, that a 1983 could be brought 

against the individual, and indeed the Attorney General 

could intervene in those cases.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If it's an individual, 

under Title IX you can't bring the suit.

 MS. HODGE: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But you could 

under 1983?

 MS. HODGE: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

and that's why I have had trouble with this case -- is 

that if you look at the First Circuit opinion, it sort 

of seems to say, "if there is a difference, of course 

you can have a 1983 suit, but if there is no difference, 

you can't." I mean, everybody here seems to agree to 

that, I guess.

 So I'm not certain what to do, because Selya 

started his opinion by saying this isn't a case where 

Title IX doesn't apply; it does apply; they have the 

funding; but he doesn't talk about the exemptions and he 

doesn't really talk about the -- a difference between 

suing an institution and suing an individual. So maybe 

what we should say is, maybe he meant it, but he didn't 

say it.

 MS. HODGE: Well, I would argue -- I would 

argue to the Court that I would hope that this Court 

would take -- would affirm the First Circuit opinion, 

but I would say to -- to -- to Your Honor the following: 

that with regard to the individual defendant in this 

case, who is the superintendent of schools, who as we 

argue, the question presented only deals with the 

institutional recipient; but nevertheless the First 

Circuit found that the individual was acting only in 

their official capacity.

 And once again, that -- that issue is not

before this Court. And having decided that they were 

acting in the individual's official capacity, we would 

argue therefore that the individual would not be sued, 

because the claim and all of the facts --

JUSTICE BREYER: So you were saying if it's 

an individual acting in his official capacity, you 

cannot sue him under Title IX?

 MS. HODGE: To the -- yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. Okay.

 MS. HODGE: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Then their answer to that 

which is now say, look, we want to sue an individual in 

his official capacity; that's why we want to bring our 

1983 suit. And then you reply, but there are bars here 

of collateral estoppel. Claim preclusion, whatever it 

is.

 MS. HODGE: Issue preclusion.

 JUSTICE BREYER: They all have new names.

 (Laughter.)

 MS. HODGE: Okay.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The -- the -- okay, so 

that's your argument.

 So why don't we just send it back, say 

that's right; this suit is not precluded by 1983; 

indeed, that's the only place can you bring it; it's not

precluded by Title IX, and now court, you go decide 

whether claim preclusion exists, or whatever they call 

it. Collateral estoppel, or -- you understand what I 

mean.

 MS. HODGE: Your Honor, I believe that they 

did decide that in the language I did quote to you just 

a moment ago from the First Circuit opinion, which is 

found at the appendix 23a or the decision. Essentially 

they are -- they are saying that -- that there was --

that because no theory of liability was offered other 

than this, that there isn't any further claim available.

 With regard to sending this case back, we 

argue, based upon the deliberative difference standard, 

which I think is indisputably -- the standard falls 

under Title IX, and the standard under the Equal 

Protection Clause -- that that deliberative difference 

standard and -- and the fact the First Circuit found 

that -- that there was -- that the Barnstable School 

Committee acted reasonably and without deliberative 

difference, precludes -- there is no issue in 

controversy anymore.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yet the other side says 

that there may be, and I don't know why we ought to get 

into that. Why can't we just send it back and let them 

figure that out? And -- and -- and decide what we took

this case to decide, namely, the split that now exists 

in the Federal courts over whether Title IX precludes 

the use of 1983. That is an important question. It's 

why we took the case. Why can't we decide that issue 

and then for all these loose ends, send it back to the 

court of appeals?

 MS. HODGE: Because there must be an issue 

in controversy for this Court to send any -- there must 

be an issue in controversy here and also --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He says there is an issue 

in controversy, that's good enough for me.

 (Laughter.)

 MS. HODGE: Well -- well, with all due 

respect, I would suggest that what you have to look at 

is the complaint, and you have to look at the argument, 

you know, what was in fact argued. And I would 

suggest --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- I'm sorry, so 

you seem to be saying that they were right, that 1983 

actions are not always precluded, depending on whether 

there is a difference in the issues that are presented 

or whatever.

 So you should never say that Title IX 

precludes an action under 1983. In fact, you should say 

that sometimes the issues that are litigated under Title

IX may result in the fact that you don't have 

available -- you don't get relief under 1983, but there 

is still a cause of action.

 MS. HODGE: I don't -- I don't believe that 

that is -- that that -- that that should -- that should 

be the result of your decisionmaking.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's kind of odd to 

say that -- as I understand what you are saying, you are 

saying that whenever there is issue preclusion, the 

consequence is that 1983 is precluded in the sense that 

actions were precluded in Smith. Well why -- I guess 

I've gotten -- maybe I am repeating the question. Why 

do we have to decide that, and we would just say there 

is a 1983 action, but you may not be able to pursue it, 

I guess is the way to put it, if your claims are 

precluded or the issues result in the fact that you 

don't recover.

 MS. HODGE: I -- I believe that that would 

be satisfactory. From our point of view because we 

believe the issue preclusion applies that would be 

satisfactory because we --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- but that doesn't 

cover the situation in which a plaintiff says, I don't 

want to proceed under Title IX; I want to proceed first 

under 1983. Then there is going to be no question about

whether 1983 is -- is unavailable because of issue 

preclusion. He is starting with 1983.

 MS. HODGE: There is no question, but in 

those circumstances then as to an institution --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What is your position on 

that --

MS. HODGE: Our position is that as a 

recipient of Federal -- if the institution involved is a 

recipient of Federal financial assistance who is covered 

by Title IX --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't proceed under 

1983.

 MS. HODGE: Cannot proceed under 1983.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So you are disagreeing.

 MS. HODGE: Yes, we are. Yes, we are 

disagreeing, and I would suggest that the difficulty 

that this Court is having, or at least as I experience 

it, the difficulty with regard to issue preclusion and 

claim preclusion turns in this case on the fact that 

this perhaps being a peer-on-peer harassment case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it quite clear we 

can forget about issue preclusion and assume as 

Justice Scalia did, the client brought an action under 

1983 and did not rely on Title IX at all, and just sued 

the school board, you would say he can't do that?

MS. HODGE: Correct. Correct.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And that's your issue, 

whether that's right or wrong. We don't have to talk 

about issue -- issue preclusion to decide that issue.

 MS. HODGE: That is correct, except that as 

we argue -- what we have argued before the Court is that 

under Smith the question is, is there a comprehensive 

remedial scheme, and we would argue that there is; but 

then have you to determine whether the claims are 

virtually identical; and we would argue that here the 

claims are virtually identical.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't your reasoning 

apply to, say, a race discrimination case in employment? 

We have got title VII and you have 1981. Title VII has 

a lot of accoutrements, a lot of text to go through; 

1981 is plain and simple. So therefore, title VII ought 

to preempt 1981, right? So you -- in the area of race 

discrimination and employment, title VII would end any 

access to 1981. It would be the same kind of argument, 

wouldn't it?

 MS. HODGE: I believe that -- that there is 

that argument, but to be honest, I'm not in a position 

right now to reflect on exactly -- I believe that that 

would be certainly the direction, however, there are 

unique aspects of race. And I believe that that is yet

another basis on which I would quarrel with the 

Petitioner with regard to suggesting that Title VI 

and -- and Title IX ought to be treated exactly the 

same. The history of sex discrimination versus race 

discrimination are quite different in scope.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What does that have to 

got to do with what you are arguing is that if you have 

an elaborate mechanism, which you said you have under 

Title IX, I think that is debatable? But that was 

certainly the picture in Smith, and it's the picture in 

Title VII, Title VII versus 1981. That -- that fits 

your -- the -- your description, Title VII and 1981, 

much better than Title IX and 1983, I think.

 MS. HODGE: I guess I -- I don't agree. It 

is our -- it is our view that 19 -- that in this 

particular instance -- and I -- and I think I may have 

misspoken if the view is, is that it's the 

administrative schemes that get compared. I -- I 

believe under Smith, the issue is whether or not there 

is a comprehensive remedial scheme, and here you have 

the remedy -- both an administrative remedy as well as a 

private right of action, which we would argue should 

preclude the 1983 claims.

 Moreover, we would also look with regard to 

the fact that this is a constitutional claim to the --

to Bivens -- to the line of cases under Bivens which we 

cite in our brief, the fact that when Congress provides 

a remedy for a particular area -- in a particular area, 

that that remedy can preclude an independent action 

which even is based on the Constitution. And we would 

suggest that that would be -- that that is something 

that we would urge this Court to consider --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because 

we're still in the business of implying rights of action 

under Bivens. And it's different to say -- you know, if 

you say we are applying it, but as soon as Congress does 

something, we are not going to do that. That's quite 

different than construing a provision like 1983 which 

Congress has enacted.

 MS. HODGE: Well, that is correct, except 

that this Court has, in fact, applied its preclusion 

doctrine by looking at whether or not Congress has made 

any statement in the statute, then if you want to take 

it statute to statute, then what you would be looking at 

is you would be looking at essentially Rancho Palos 

Verdes. And as -- as this Court did in -- when it 

decided Rancho Palos Verdes, it remanded for 

consideration communities of equity, which is a Title IX 

case for reconsideration by, I believe it's the Eighth 

Circuit under the Rancho Palos Verdes decision.

And while that case ultimately did not come 

back to this Court, but the circuit court determined 

that it treated -- it treated the issue differently, and 

we would argue that that is a part of this split, and 

that that is -- and that is not the appropriate 

resolution.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no 

constitutional claim in -- what was it -- Palos Verdes.

 MS. HODGE: Exactly. There was no 

constitutional claim in Rancho Palos Verdes. However, 

this Court did cite Smith and did cite Smith in its 

decision and -- and favorably so. But moreover, we 

would argue that -- the question is really a different 

-- comparing a statute to statute, which is Title IX to 

section 1983. Congress allowed for actions in 1983, 

Congress allows for actions under Title IX, or whether 

or not you are looking at the issue of Title IX versus a 

constitutional claim.

 Now, I want to just make the point that 

preclusion makes sense. Congress really did put the 

focus in Title IX on the institution, and Congress is 

also seeking to have equity of enforcement.

 Further, as set for in the amici in support 

of the Respondents' position, we would point out that if 

section 1983 claims are not precluded, that it would

require the expenditure of funds by -- by recipients of 

federal financial assistance on a variety of issues that 

are totally unnecessary including qualified immunity.

 And on the peer-on-peer harassment case, I 

think it's very important to focus on what this case is. 

It is a peer-on-peer, student-on-student harassment 

where, what you would have is, if you were going to 

allow additional claims under section 1983 against the 

institution, it would -- it would intrude and interfere 

with the school's processes of disciplining students.

 And I would also suggest that it might also 

interfere in the classic manner in which --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me ask you one sort of 

anomaly that keeps running through my mind in this case. 

If you have two school boards, one of -- two schools, 

state schools, one gets federal funds and the other does 

not, does this preclude -- no 1983 remedy against one, 

but there is a 1983 remedy against the other, that's 

your view, isn't it?

 MS. HODGE: It is exactly our view because 

the recipients would be subject to the remedial scheme 

set forth in Title IX.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is it anomalous to think 

it --

believe the reverse is anomalous, because what you would 

be suggesting if you do not preclude section 1983, you 

would suggest that the recipient could have both the 

1983 and a Title IX, whereas the nonrecipient would have 

just section 1983.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would it prove the same 

facts in both cases? I mean, the case of it would 

involve the same evidence, same alleged wrongdoing, and 

then one case you can rely on 1983 and the other you 

can't?

 MS. HODGE: I believe under those 

circumstances, Justice Stevens, that what we would be 

talking about would be the situation where a -- under 

Title IX there is -- there's actually an easier path to 

recovery, if you will, because it does not require the 

specific intent required by Massachusetts v. Feeney, 

which we believe sets a slightly higher -- a bar and a 

higher level of intentionality.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought you just said 

that a deliberate indifference under both statutes, 

under 1983 and Title IX.

 MS. HODGE: Your Honor, it is -- deliberate 

indifference is the standard. However, in order to 

prove a constitutional violation, you must also have the 

specific intent for invidious discrimination that we --

that this Court has not imposed and did not impose in 

Davis for violations of peer -- for peer-on-peer 

harassment cases.

 So, while the discrimination needs to be 

intentional under Title IX, it is not required that 

there be the specific intent to favor one over the other 

or one protected status over the other.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you wouldn't have 

gender discrimination.

 MS. HODGE: But you -- excuse me, I'm sorry. 

You would have gender discrimination if you have a 

typical -- in the peer-on-peer harassment cases, the 

question is whether or not the institution was or was 

not deliberately indifferent in the manner in which it 

responds. In -- in a deliberate indifference --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Response to what? 

Response --

MS. HODGE: To a complaint about sexual 

harassment. If the institution fails to respond 

appropriately, the lower courts have found that that can 

be gender discrimination under Title IX. They do not in 

any way look to ensure that -- look to determine whether 

or not there is that specific invidious discrimination 

that we would argue this Court has imposed in its cases 

under the Equal Protection Clause.

recipient of federal financial assistance?

constitutional standard is different, so I am just 

giving you a case. It could be a school, it could be

 Two principal points. First on the proper

indicates Congress saw Title IX solely as vindicating

the constitutional right to be free from gender 

discrimination perpetrated by educational institutions; 

it follows that the plaintiff's equal protection claims 

are precluded.

 That was not a holding that had to do with 

claim preclusion, issue preclusion, title estoppel; it's 

a holding that constitutional claims simply cannot go 

forward. So there were constitutional claims were 

advanced below, argued to both courts, that have not 

been discussed by any court at any point, and I think 

the proper disposition here is, the most regular course 

in a case of this sort to is decide the question 

presented, send the case back.

 It certainly is not the case -- it's a 

commonplace that the Court has threshold questions that 

are presented to it. There are remaining issues that 

have to be resolved on remand, it's certainly not the 

Court's usual practice to decide whether or not 

plaintiffs can -- can prevail on those claims on remand 

before deciding the threshold question on which cert was 

granted. I think that's the appropriate approach for 

the Court to take here.

 On the merits, very quickly. Again I think 

we have to -- the gold standard of evidence as to 

preclusion, we have expressed statutory text that deals

with it. Learned colleague suggested that the Attorney 

General intervention provision somehow limited the cases 

involving claims by schools that do not accept Federal 

funds are somehow not subject to Title IX. That is not 

the language of the provision. The provision says 

whenever -- whenever it is claimed, it is initiated, in 

a court of the United States asserting deprivation of 

rights essentially on account of sex, the Attorney 

General can intervene. Clearly Congress had it in mind 

that there would be such claims, and this was enacted as 

part of -- Title IX was enacted as part of the statute 

that creates rights against discrimination by schools 

receiving Federal funds. It makes no sense to suggest 

that Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, does that provision 

apply only when there is a Title IX cause of action?

 MR. ROTHFELD: No. No.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh well, if it doesn't, 

then it -- then it has validity whether or not you agree 

with your position.

 MR. ROTHFELD: That's true but I think it 

answers the preclusion question that it suggests that 

Congress has it in mind that there would in fact be 

section 1983 constitutional litigation involving gender 

discrimination.

JUSTICE SCALIA: They thought only in cases 

where there is no Title IX action.

 MR. ROTHFELD: They said whenever there is a 

claim of unconstitutional gender discrimination. I 

think it's a blanket suggestion Congress made --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, you don't think they 

mean whether there is a valid claim? Even when there is 

a claim that isn't allowed under the law?

 MR. ROTHFELD: I am suggesting that the 

language says that whenever a claim of gender 

discrimination is advanced under the Constitution, the 

Attorney General can intervene. I think what we can 

draw from that is Congress imagined, it said there would 

be constitutional litigation involving gender 

discrimination after they enacted the law. And because 

that provision was added to the law as part of Title IX, 

Congress surely contemplated that these suits would 

involve gender discrimination involving schools.

 The other sort of clear textual indication 

which again, again my learned colleague has not really 

discussed, is the Title VI history of enforcement prior 

to the enactment of Title IX, which would absolutely --

that there are almost two such dozen decisions, which 

this Court incorporated into the canon, which suggests 

it is not only appropriate, it's realistic to think that

when Congress was aware of at the time it enacted Title 

IX. Those decisions clearly indicated there was no 

preclusion. The language of Title VI and Title IX is 

identical. There can be no doubt, I think, that 

Congress would have had it in mind, which, if it is not 

appropriate in this context as well.

 One final, very quick point. This is an 

implied right of action; to suggest that Congress meant 

to preclude the use of the Constitution to enforce --

preclude section 1983 to enforce the Constitution while 

leaving it to the courts to imply the alternative 

remedy, to devise the contours on and the limitations on 

that remedy, would require -- hypothesize a remarkable 

leap of faith on the part of Congress.

 It also would require the most extravagant 

and speculative reading of Title IX, to understand that 

it's not only to include private rights of action but to 

preclude the assertion of express rights of action 

created by Congress by a language in another statute.

 If there are no further questions, Your 

Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:10 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
