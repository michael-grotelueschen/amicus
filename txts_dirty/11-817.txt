 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE 

6  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

7  MR. GARRE: Thank you, Your Honor, and may 

8 it please the Court: 

9  The question in this case is when does a 

trained drug detection dog's alert to a vehicle 

11 establish probable cause to search the vehicle? 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Are you for or against the 

13 dog this time? 

14  MR. GARRE: For it again, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: For it. 

16  MR. GARRE: The Florida Supreme Court 

17 answered that question by erecting what we think is an 

18 extraordinary set of evidentiary requirements, in 

19 effect, puts the dog on trial in any suppression hearing 

in which defendant chooses to challenge the reliability 

21 of the dog. 

22  I think, most fundamentally, the problem 

23 with the court of appeals' -- the Supreme Court's 

24 decision -- is that it misconceives what this Court's 

cases conceive of the probable cause requirement, 

3

1 converting probable cause, which this Court has referred 

2 to as a substantial chance, or fair probability, of the 

3 detection of contraband or evidence of a crime, into 

4 what amounts to a continuously updated batting average 

and a requirement that dogs be virtually infallible. 

6  That -- that --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Garre --

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- that goes to the 

9 field performance; but, the other requirements, that 

the -- some showing that the test -- that the training 

11 program is reputable, some showing that the handler, not 

12 only the dog, has -- has had training, it seems to me 

13 those two -- not -- there's nothing improper about that. 

14  MR. GARRE: Well, and I think, Your Honor, 

under our view of it, it's okay to inquire into whether 

16 or not the dog has successfully completed a bona fide 

17 training program, which -- which we think is a training 

18 program in which the dog is going to be tested for 

19 proficiency, including in a setting where some vehicles 

have drugs and some vehicles don't. 

21  And Aldo, the dog in this case, clearly was. 

22 He'd received a 120-hour training program with the 

23 police department in Apopka, Florida. He received a 

24 40-hour refresher seminar by another police department 

in Dothan, Alabama. And he was subjected to continuous 

4

25

Official 

1 weekly training, in which part of that training 

2 consisted of taking him out, walking him by some 

3 vehicles that contained cars, some vehicles that didn't. 

4  And the testimony of Officer Wheetley was 

that Aldo's performance was really good. And what he 

6 meant by that was that if there were eight cars with 

7 drugs. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't -- then why 

9 didn't they get the dog recertified? By the time of the 

search, the certification had expired 16 months. 

11  MR. GARRE: It was a lapse, Your Honor. The 

12 dog subsequently was recertified. 

13  Our position is that the Fourth Amendment 

14 doesn't impose an annual certification requirement. 

Some states have it, some states don't. 

16  I think, more important in this case was the 

17 fact that the dog was continuously trained, continuously 

18 evaluated in training. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what do you -- what 

do you have to show to establish that the dog was well 

21 trained. 

22  MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, I think the 

23 most important thing is successful completion of 

24 proficiency testing.

 I mean, what -- what our friends would like,

1 and what the Florida Supreme Court would like, would 

2 really for the courts to delve into all aspects of the 

3 training, what types of distracters were used, what type 

4 of smell and printing was used and the like.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, if it were just 

6 that -- you have the show that the program was 

7 reputable. 

8  MR. GARRE: Well, certainly that it was 

9 authentic, Your Honor. And here, the programs were --

were conducted by actual police departments in -- in 

11 Alabama and Florida. And this Court ordinarily would 

12 presume regularity in those sorts of training settings. 

13  And there's no reason to approach the 

14 training of a dog any differently, but --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought all of these 

16 training facilities were private entities that 

17 contracted with police departments. 

18  MR. GARRE: No, Your Honor. The 

19 certification. Certification usually is done by private 

entities which are operated by former law enforcement 

21 officers. But the training itself, it usually and here 

22 was done by police departments themselves. 

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I go back to 

24 Justice Ginsburg's question? There's no -- what I 

hear -- read the Florida court saying is there's no

1 national standard for certification. That's correct? 

2  MR. GARRE: Yes. 

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's no national 

4 standard that defines what's adequate training, correct.

 MR. GARRE: That's right. There --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So -- let me just finish 

7 my question. So assuming there's no national standards, 

8 then how do you expect a judge, without asking questions 

9 about the content of the certification process, the 

content of the training process, and what the results 

11 were and how they were measured, how do you expect a 

12 judge to decide whether the certification and the 

13 training are sufficiently adequate. 

14  MR. GARRE: And I think that the central 

inquiry that we would think the judge would undertake is 

16 to determine whether or not the dog was performing 

17 successfully in proficiency testing. 

18  I mean -- after all, that's why we train the 

19 dogs. And if --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you still have to 

21 ask what that training was, and the judge still has to 

22 determine whether the judge believes it was adequate, 

23 correct? That's what the totality of circumstances 

24 requires.

 MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, in our view,

1 we don't think it's -- it's an appropriate role for the 

2 Court to delve into the contours of the training, what 

3 specific methods were used to train or distract or --

4 you know, all the contours that they bring up in their 

brief. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what does a judge do, 

7 just say, the police department says this is adequate, 

8 so I have to accept it's adequate? 

9  MR. GARRE: Not -- you would have to accept 

it, Your Honor, on its face. I think you -- in a record 

11 like this -- and I think this record is clearly 

12 sufficient -- and, ultimately, that's what we're asking 

13 this Court to hold -- what you have in the record 

14 is evidence --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Garre, I -- I have 

16 no problem that this record -- with this record. My 

17 problem is how do we rule. 

18  Because it seems the me that I'm not quite 

19 understanding what -- how -- the legal rule you're 

asking us to announce. I think the legal rule, you're 

21 saying, if the dog has been tested for proficiency by a 

22 police department's determination of what's adequate for 

23 proficiency, that establishes probable cause. That's 

24 what I think the rule you want us to -- to do.

 I don't know what the role of the judge is

1 in that --

2  MR. GARRE: I think it would be close --

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- with that rule. 

4  MR. GARRE: -- close to that. We would ask 

whether or not the dog successfully treated -- completed 

6 training by a bona fide organization. And here --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No certification, no 

8 questioning of the handler and the handler's training? 

9 The judge can't do any of that and shouldn't do any of 

that. 

11  MR. GARRE: Certification is not required. 

12 It may be one way that the police department could 

13 establish reliability a different way, but certification 

14 itself is not required when you have a record of the 

type of training that you have here. 

16  We do think that you could put the handler 

17 on the stand and ask about the reliability, certain 

18 questions about reliability. 

19  We don't think, in a record like this, the 

judge would say, well, it says that he completed 120 

21 hours in narcotics detection at the Apopka, Florida 

22 police department, and 40 hours at the Dothan police 

23 department, so --

24  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's not enough for 

you to win by us saying that a court can't insist on

1 performance in the field records, that it has to look at 

2 the totality of the circumstances. 

3  What other case have -- have we announced, 

4 under a totality of the circumstance test, an absolute 

flat rule like the one you're proposing? Where else 

6 have we said that one thing alone establishes probable 

7 cause --

8  MR. GARRE: Your Honor --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that one factor 

alone. 

11  MR. GARRE: -- I think one area where the 

12 Court mentioned that was in the Lago Vista case, where 

13 it talked about the importance of clear rules for police 

14 officers and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose that if the 

16 reasonableness of a search depended upon some evidence 

17 given by a medical doctor, the Court would not go back 

18 and examine how well that doctor was trained at Harvard 

19 Medical School and, you know, what classes he took and 

so forth, right. 

21  MR. GARRE: Absolutely. And the same way 

22 that when an officer provides evidence for a search 

23 warrant, we don't demand the training of the officer, 

24 what schools he went to or what specific courses he had 

in probable cause.

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Garre, you said there 

2 was the certification, training program, but you gave a 

3 third. You said, or otherwise show proficiency in 

4 locating narcotics.

 So if there is no certification, no 

6 training, how would the state establish that the dog was 

7 reliable in detecting drugs? 

8  MR. GARRE: Your Honor, I think that that 

9 would be the unusual case, and it probably would be 

captured by the other factors; but, what we meant by 

11 including that is that there's no limit on the types of 

12 evidence that the police could submit to show 

13 reliability. 

14  If you didn't have certification or a formal 

training program, the fact that there was evidence that 

16 a dog like Aldo successfully performed in weekly 

17 training over the course of the year, and the police 

18 submitted the records, like the records in the Joint 

19 Appendix in this case at pages 106 and 116, that might 

be another way of establishing reliability. 

21  But the -- the central way would be showing 

22 that the dog successfully completed training or that the 

23 dog was certified. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I think you'll agree 

that the handler, too, the handler would have to --

Official 

1  MR. GARRE: Well, Your Honor, we don't think 

2 there is a Fourth Amendment requirement of certification 

3 for handlers. Again, this is something that varies 

4 among states.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not -- not certification, 

6 but that the handler has been -- has been trained --

7  MR. GARRE: Yes. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to work with drug 

9 detection dogs.

 MR. GARRE: That's correct. And Officer 

11 Wheetley here, of course, had been trained. He had 

12 gotten a 160-hour course in narcotics detection, and had 

13 done training with Aldo in the Dothan, Alabama police 

14 department, 40 hours there.

 And these dog -- the dog, Aldo, and Officer 

16 Wheetley had worked together for about a year before the 

17 time of the search. 

18  The handlers themselves are going to be in 

19 the best position to know the dogs and evaluate their 

reliability. And they have a strong incentive to ensure 

21 the dogs are reliable. That's both because they don't 

22 want to miss contraband when it's available -- when it 

23 exists in the field; and, also, they don't want to be 

24 put into harm's way.

 The traffic stop, in particular, is one of

1 the most dangerous encounters police officers face. 

2 They're not going to want to be working with a dog that 

3 is consistently putting the officer in a position of 

4 searching cars based on an alert when that dog is not 

reliable in predicting the presence --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm somewhat 

7 troubled by all of the studies that have been presented 

8 to the Court, particularly the Australian one where, 

9 under a controlled setting, one dog alerted correctly 

only 12 percent of the time. 

11  How and when and who determines when a dog's 

12 reliability in alerting has reached a critical failure 

13 number? And what is -- what do you suggest that number 

14 is, and how does a judge determine that that's being 

monitored? 

16  MR. GARRE: We don't think the 

17 Fourth Amendment puts a number on it. This Court has 

18 rejected a numerical conception of probable cause. 

19  But with respect --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I'm deeply 

21 troubled by a dog that alerts only 12 percent of the 

22 time. Whatever -- whether we have a fixed number or an 

23 unfixed number, that seems like less than probability 

24 for me.

 MR. GARRE: But, but let me -- let me

1 address the, the South Wales study, Your Honor, which I 

2 think is the one that you were referring to and that's 

3 the primary one relied on by the other side. In that 

4 case they reported that over the course of several years 

the dogs' alerts resulted in discovery of drugs only 26 

6 percent of the time. 

7  But there is another part of that study 

8 which doesn't come up in the amicus briefs, and that's 

9 that in 60 percent of the other cases the individuals 

admitted to using drugs or being in the proximity of 

11 drugs. And if you include that in the universe of 

12 accurate alerts, as you should, then the number becomes 

13 70 percent of dogs accurately alerting. That 70 percent 

14 based on the primary study that they rely upon --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That doesn't answer what 

16 happens to the dogs who have -- dogs grow old. They are 

17 taken out of service for a reason. So how -- how is a 

18 court supposed to monitor whether or not a dog has 

19 fallen out of --

MR. GARRE: Well, primarily by looking at 

21 whether the dog has successfully completed training. 

22 And you're right, dogs do go out of service when they 

23 reach a certain age. Dogs, like humans, become old and 

24 impaired over time. But -- but looking at weekly 

training records, like are available in this case, dogs

25

Official 

1 that successfully perform week in and week out in 

2 training are going to successfully perform in the -- in 

3 the real world. 

4  And, after all, I think the most problematic 

aspect of the challenges to the reliability of these 

6 dogs is that law enforcement agencies across the country 

7 at the state and Federal level, law enforcement agencies 

8 around the world, and law enforcement agencies that 

9 protect this Court rely on detection dogs as reliable 

predictors of the evidence of contraband, evidence 

11 of the presence of explosives or likewise. 

12  And this is an area where we think that a 

13 page of logic and experience is worth a volume -- a page 

14 of experience and history is worth a volume of logic. 

These dogs have been used and are being used in many 

16 settings across the country and across the world today. 

17 And the reason they are being used is because the people 

18 who work with them know that they are reliable and --

19 and know by experience that they are reliable.

 And that's one of the central problems we 

21 have with the argument on the other side, is that 

22 ultimately this Court should distrust the reliability of 

23 the dogs. And again --

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Garre, could I 

understand your argument? Because -- suppose in a case 

15

25

Official 

1 the government comes in, says this dog has been through 

2 training and the handler has been through training. And 

3 this is a case in which -- this is never going to come 

4 up when the dog actually alerts to narcotics; it's not 

worth anybody's time at that point. 

6  It's only going to come up in a case like 

7 this, where a dog alerts to narcotics, there is no --

8 there are no narcotics, but something else is found, and 

9 so the person ends up being criminally prosecuted. So 

it's, you know, a small universe of cases. 

11  So the government comes in and says that the 

12 dog has been trained. Can -- can the criminal defendant 

13 at that point call the handler, say, how has the dog 

14 been trained, what are the methods that -- that the dog 

has -- was used, and how did the dog do in training? 

16 Can the -- can the defendant do that. 

17  MR. GARRE: Your Honor, I think that the 

18 defendant can call the handler and can ask those sorts 

19 of questions. I think the court would cut it off if you 

got into questions like, well, did they use the 

21 play-reward or the scent-imprinting method in training. 

22 Well, what specifics -- because I think that delves too 

23 far into the details. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: But you can ask questions 

like how did the dog do in training.

1  MR. GARRE: Yes, and that was done here. 

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: And how about if you really, 

3 if there were some articles that said, you know, that 

4 there was a certain kind of method that, for example, 

led to a lot of subconscious cueing by the handler. 

6 Could the -- could the criminal defendant say, did you 

7 use that method that leads to these problematic results? 

8  MR. GARRE: I -- I don't think so, Your 

9 Honor. First of all, cueing is not part of this case 

because they haven't argued that the dog was cued. The 

11 argument is the dog was just sort of inherently 

12 reliable. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: I'm using "cueing" not in 

14 terms of any intentionality, but one thing that I 

learned in reading all of this was that one difficulty 

16 here is that dogs respond to subconscious cues and that 

17 there are different ways of training that make that less 

18 or more of a problem. 

19  MR. GARRE: And our position is, is that you 

can inquire into cueing during this hearing, that the 

21 defendants can -- can argue that the dog was cued, and 

22 in -- in the course of that argument you might be able 

23 to get into those sorts of things. That's different 

24 than the challenge that was made here. There wasn't a 

cueing challenge made in this case.

1  I would like to just go back to one of the 

2 premises of your question, which is that the dog in this 

3 case didn't accurately alert. The dog in this case 

4 accurately alerted to the odor of illegal narcotics.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, I didn't mean to say 

6 that. I just meant to say that there were -- there were 

7 no drugs found. 

8  MR. GARRE: Right. And, and I think that's 

9 another central problem with the Florida supreme court's 

decision, is this notion that alerts to so-called 

11 residual odors aren't indicative of the dog's 

12 reliability. A dog's alert to the lingering odor of 

13 methamphetamine which was in the car, must have been in 

14 the car in this case, is just as accurate as a dog's 

alert to the presence of methamphetamine itself in the 

16 car.

security and law --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I have two 

7 separate questions for you. Tying the earlier case a 

8 little bit to this one, I am assuming that your position 

9 is -- and you'll tell me what the legal standard is --

that a well-trained dog, if he alerts, or walks by a row 

11 of apartments, a row of houses, and alerts to drugs, 

12 that that simple alert is probable cause for the police 

13 to get a search warrant. 

14  MR. PALMORE: Yes, we believe that an alert 

by a trained dog is sufficient to establish probable 

16 cause. 

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that, without any 

18 other information about -- unlike the earlier case or 

19 this one, where the police officer saw the individual 

being nervous, et cetera, et cetera -- that all -- all 

21 it takes is a dog alert, despite the fact that there is 

22 no study that says the dogs reliably alert 100 percent 

23 of the time? 

24  MR. PALMORE: 100 percent of the time is of 

course not required for probable cause.

Supreme Court. It demanded infallibility where 

6 infallibility is not required. 

7  In terms of studies, it is actually well 

8 studied --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So -- so shouldn't we be 

addressing the question whether a -- an alert,

12 standing by itself, enough?

14 course reliability is important. The question is how 

you determine reliability. This is a somewhat unique 

16 setting where the law enforcement tool is actually 

17 tested initially and on an ongoing basis in a controlled 

18 setting to establish its reliability. Your Honor asked 

19 what the standard for bona fide training is.

 We think the -- the important point is the 

21 outcome of the training: Is the dog proficient? Can 

22 the dog reliably detect narcotics odor and only 

23 narcotics odor in a controlled setting where false 

24 positives and false negatives can accurately be 

measured? That record is established here.

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, only because the 

2 officer said that he satisfactorily performed --

3  MR. PALMORE: Well --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and what the Florida 

court said: But we don't know what that means. 

6  MR. PALMORE: Well, we -- I think we do know 

7 what it means, Your Honor. There are two different 

8 showings that are made here. There is a formal training 

9 and formal certification, both for the dog and the 

handler separately, and then a separate training, formal 

11 training together. 

12  But then, just as important, you have 

13 ongoing, but less formal, proficiency exercises 

14 conducted by the handler in which the dog, in a 

controlled setting where errors could reliably be 

16 identified, performed quite strongly, including 2 days 

17 before the arrest here. So that's JA 113 on June 22nd, 

18 the dog performed perfectly in a controlled setting. 

19  And we have -- there are records in this 

case going back several months before the arrest and 

21 several months after the arrest showing that -- that 

22 this dog passed the test, this dog was reliable. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you agree that 

24 that's an appropriate area of inquiry?

 MR. PALMORE: We think it is.

3 school, he was certified, the judge can say, when was he 

4 last tested, right? When did he last go through some --

MR. PALMORE: Yes, I think the judge can ask 

6 those kinds of questions. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The -- the only 

8 thing really you say they can't ask about is what's --

9 what's his record.

 MR. PALMORE: Well, there is a question --

11 there are a couple sub-issues here. The principal vice 

12 of the Florida Supreme Court was in imposing an 

13 unprecedented and inflexible set of evidentiary 

14 obligations that are part of the government's 

affirmative case that the government has to always 

16 introduce any time it seeks to establish probable cause 

17 based on a dog alert. We think that's fundamentally 

18 misplaced for a -- for a variety of reasons. 

19  The question of what the government -- what 

are fair game questions for a defendant to ask once the 

21 handler is on the stand is a -- is a different question. 

22 And --

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And judges do this 

24 thousands of times in thousands of cases. They ask: 

Was the tip reliable? There are any number of 

22

Official 

1 permutations. It's a question of whether or not the 

2 trial judge was -- made a correct determination in 

3 determining that there was or was not sufficient cause 

4 for the police to proceed. It just happens every day.

 MR. PALMORE: I think that's right, Your 

6 Honor, but I think the -- the critical aspect of 

7 reliability in this context is the dog's performance in 

8 a controlled setting. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Palmore, you 

criticize the Florida Supreme Court for requiring 

11 evidence of field performance; and, assuming that that 

12 evidence is not required, if the defendant, in preparing 

13 for the suppression motion, wants what information there 

14 is, would it be proper to seek -- for the defendant --

would it be permissible for the defendant to speak -- to 

16 seek through discovery whatever field performance 

17 records there are? 

18  MR. PALMORE: We don't think so, certainly 

19 not as a routine basis. The kind of burden that that 

might impose on law enforcement we don't think is 

21 justified. 

22  That's a separate question from whether the 

23 defendant can ask the handler, if the handler is on the 

24 stand, about field performance, and then the court can 

give that answer whatever weight is appropriate. 

23

Official 

1  We think, typically, an answer on field 

2 performance is not going to be material. It's not going 

3 to be helpful. Because the problem is in the field, 

4 when a dog alerts, the dog is trained to alert to the 

odor of drugs. 

6  Your -- it's like a -- what the -- Florida 

7 Supreme Court wanted a batting average, a batting 

8 average that would be calculated when we know the number 

9 of at bats, but we don't know in many cases whether 

there was a hit or an out. So we had a fraction where 

11 we know the denominator but not the numerator. 

12  The answer to the Florida supreme court's 

13 question and concern about reliability, again, is to go 

14 back to the controlled setting, where we know what's a 

hit and what's an out, and we can calculate a reliable 

16 batting average. That needs to be where the focus 

17 should be in determining the reliability of a dog. 

18  And there should -- there's no reason to 

19 constitutionalize the process or the training 

methodologies that get you to that point. What matters 

21 is, is this dog successful in a setting in which we can 

22 measure success. 

23  And I think that it's also important to 

24 point out that the Florida court was basically alone in 

establishing these unprecedented and inflexible sets of 

24

1 evidentiary requirements. 

2  There is a large body of case law in the 

3 lower courts on the reliability of drug detection dogs 

4 going back 30 or 40 years, and there are no other 

courts, no other appellate courts to be sure, that have 

6 imposed these kinds of requirements on law enforcement 

7 when it seeks to establish probable cause for a 

8 detection -- for after a detection dog alerts. 

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: If you take out the Florida 

Supreme Court and this one trial court in Massachusetts, 

11 basically you think what courts have been doing is the 

12 right thing? 

13  MR. PALMORE: In general. There is some 

14 diversity across the courts, but I think that if you 

look at Judge Gorsuch's opinion in the Ludwig case from 

16 the Tenth Circuit, or the Jones case from the Virginia 

17 supreme court, you see approaches that are basically 

18 sound, where courts have confidence that if law 

19 enforcement comes in and says, this dog is trained and 

has demonstrated proficiency in a training setting, that 

21 that dog is generally reliable. 

22  And I think, as Mr. Garre --

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: But where at the same time 

24 they'll allow a defendant to question the handler about 

that training, about how the dog has performed in that

1 training; is that right? 

2  MR. PALMORE: Yes. Those questions can be 

3 asked. 

4  But I think it's critical, as Mr. Garre 

pointed out, that the courts not constitutionalize dog 

6 training methodologies or hold mini trials with expert 

7 witnesses on what makes for a successful dog training 

8 program. Because, as Mr. Garre said, the government has 

9 critical interests, life and death interests, that it 

stakes on the reliability of these dogs. 

11  So the U.S. Marshals use dogs to protect 

12 Federal judges. The Federal Protective Services use 

13 dogs to keep bombs out of Federal buildings. The TSA 

14 uses dogs to keep bombs off of airplanes. FEMA uses 

dogs to find survivors after hurricanes. 

16  There are 32 K-9 teams in the field right 

17 now in New York and New Jersey looking for survivors of 

18 Hurricane Sandy. 

19  So, in situation after situation, the 

government has in a sense put its money where its mouth 

21 is, and it believes at an institutional level that these 

22 dogs are quite reliable. And I think the courts --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you -- I'm not 

24 sure it's relevant, but do dogs -- are their -- does 

their ability -- is it even across the board? In other

1 words, if you have a dog that's trained and good at 

2 sniffing out heroin, the same dog is going to be good at 

3 detecting a bomb, or is there some difference? 

4  MR. PALMORE: No, there -- well, I think any 

dog could be trained in either discipline. And if you 

6 look at the Scientific Working Group on Detection Dogs 

7 report that we cite in our brief, the report explains 

8 that the same general methodologies and the same 

9 different -- same general approach is used to train each 

kinds of dogs. But, typically, a drug detection dog 

11 will not be cross-trained on explosives. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you don't know 

13 whether -- in other words, are dogs good at sniffing 

14 things, or are they -- can they be good at bombs, but 

not good at meth? 

16  MR. PALMORE: Well, I don't know the 

17 specific answer to that. I think once a dog kind of 

18 chooses a major, that's what they stick with. But I 

19 think the important point is that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't want coon dogs 

21 chasing squirrels. 

22  MR. PALMORE: Right. But I think the 

23 important point is that these dogs have to meet -- have

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLEN P. GIFFORD 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

8  MR. GIFFORD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

9 please the Court:

 There is no canine exception to the totality 

11 of the circumstances test for probable cause to conduct 

12 a warrantless search. If that is true, as it must be, 

13 any fact that bears on a dog's reliability as a detector 

14 of the presence of drugs comes within the purview of the 

courts. This can encompass evidence of initial 

16 training, certification, maintenance training and 

17 performance in the field. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you understand the 

19 government to disagree with that general position? In 

other words, the trial court, if you have an attorney 

21 that's really concerned about the training of this dog, 

22 they can ask about it.

24 to disagree about the relevance of field performance.

3  JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't think they 

4 disagreed about what he may do; I thought they disagreed 

about what he must do. That is, the Florida Supreme 

6 Court said you must, da, da, da, da, da, and gave a 

7 whole list. I thought that's what the case was about. 

8  MR. GIFFORD: Well, the Florida Supreme 

9 Court did have several passages in its opinion where it 

talked about what the state must produce. And at first 

11 glance, that looks rather didactic. 

12  However, what I think the Florida Supreme 

13 Court was saying there was that if this -- these records 

14 exist, the state must produce them. And that is 

consistent with the state's burden of proof to justify a 

16 warrantless search. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: That's a totally different 

18 matter. Of course, I agree with you that a trial judge 

19 has control of the trial. He's likely to know what's 

relevant. In different circumstances, different matters 

21 will be, and he has first say on what you're going to go 

22 into. It's the must.

requires that list?

 MR. GIFFORD: No, I don't think so, even 

6 though they used the word "must." I think that the 

7 "must" concerns performance records and training records 

8 that exist. 

9  Farther down in the opinion, the court says 

reasons why the -- why the state should keep and present 

11 performance records --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: But what --

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so if the state 

14 doesn't keep -- if the state doesn't keep any 

performance records, then there would be no field 

16 performance to show, but that doesn't mean the state 

17 loses; is that what you're saying? 

18  The state doesn't keep performance records. 

19 The Florida Supreme Court seemed to say field 

performance records are required. 

21  MR. GIFFORD: If the state does not keep 

22 field performance records, that is a fact, that is a 

23 lack of evidence that could be held against the state in 

24 the suppression hearing. And it shifts the focus onto 

providing evidence of the initial training, the

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: Now I thought the

the Florida court was saying is that if you didn't 

6 produce it, the dog's evidence would -- would not be 

7 allowed -- it's --

8  MR. GIFFORD: They did use --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the search is invalid.

 MR. GIFFORD: The court did use the word 

11 must --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

13  MR. GIFFORD: -- but it's not -- it's not a 

14 specific recipe that can't be deviated from. Because, 

in addition to listing the records that must be 

16 produced, the Florida Supreme Court also said, and all 

17 other evidence that bears on the reliability of the dog. 

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Even worse. 

19  MR. GIFFORD: So it's not a specific recipe, 

and it's talking about what -- if these records exist, 

21 they must be produced. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you conceding that 

23 the Florida Supreme Court, at least with respect to the 

24 field performance records, was wrong, that they -- it is 

not a Fourth Amendment requirement?

-- but they outline what the government must prove, and 

6 that was one of them. 

7  MR. GIFFORD: They said what the government 

8 must produce if those records exist. But when you go 

9 down to the part of the opinion where the court applies 

the law to the facts, the court didn't just say, because 

11 there were no field performance records, no probable 

12 cause, we close up shop, conviction reversed. 

13  What the court did was take into 

14 consideration the lack of field performance records, the 

lack of any records about initial training and 

16 certification aside from the fact that this dog had a 

17 certificate. 

18  And we have to remember that this 

19 certificate, not only was it 16 months out of date, it 

wasn't a certificate for Aldo. It was a certificate for 

21 Aldo and a Seminole County deputy together as a team. 

22  This dog was never certified as part of a 

23 team with Officer Wheetley in this case. And the 

24 certifications in this area are team certifications, not 

individual certifications.

 MR. GIFFORD: No, but that's an indicator of 

6 reliability, which is the ultimate test here, has this 

7 team been trained and certified together --

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, fine. Counsel can 

9 bring that up. Counsel can bring that up at the hearing 

before the judge. But -- but I understood this to be 

11 a -- a requirement. You never even get to that hearing, 

12 because there's no evidence that this dog was ever 

13 trained with this policeman.

such evidence.

19 that the dog wasn't trained with this policeman means 

that you need to look for evidence -- other evidence of 

21 reliability, which also doesn't exist in this case.

2 worked effectively as a team? 

3  MR. GIFFORD: Well, first, this weekly 

4 training is maintenance training. It's to maintain the 

dog at a level of proficiency that has previously been 

6 established. That level of proficiency hadn't been 

7 established with this team of Wheetley and Aldo. The 

8 level of proficiency that had been established was with 

9 Wheetley and with another Seminole County deputy.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what -- what are 

11 the -- what are the incentives here? Why would a police 

12 department want to use an incompetent dog? Is that any 

13 more likely than that a medical school would want to 

14 certify an incompetent doctor? What -- what incentive 

is there for a police department? 

16  MR. GIFFORD: The incentive is to acquire 

17 probable cause to search when it wouldn't otherwise --

18 otherwise be available. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: And that's a good thing?

 MR. GIFFORD: Is that a good thing? 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you acquire 

22 probable cause, you go in and there's nothing there.

3 department doesn't care about that, but it certainly 

4 cares about wasting the time of its police officers in 

fruitless searches. 

6  MR. GIFFORD: The incentive of the officer 

7 to be able to conduct a search when he doesn't otherwise 

8 have probable cause is a powerful incentive. As the 

9 Court has said, ferreting out crime is a competitive 

enterprise. And also, these --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: Willy-nilly. Officers just 

12 like to search. They don't particularly want to search 

13 where they're likely to find something. They just like 

14 to search. So let's get dogs that, you know, smell 

drugs when there are no drugs. You really think that 

16 that's what's going on here? 

17  MR. GIFFORD: Officers like -- officers like 

18 to search so that they can get probable cause so that 

19 they can advance their career. Forfeiture is also an 

issue in this --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: They like to search where 

22 they're likely to find something, and that only exists 

23 when the dog is well trained. It seems to me they have 

24 every incentive to train the dog well.

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm -- getting back 

7 to -- I'm confused about the difference between must and 

8 is required. What if the judge has before him or her a 

9 record, this is where the dog went to school and it's a 

bona fide school, this is where the dog was certified, 

11 he's trained every -- every, you know, couple of weeks 

12 or whatever it is, and the judge says, do you have any 

13 field records, and the officer says, no, and the 

14 drug says -- the judge says, well, then no probable 

cause. That's reversible error, right? 

16  MR. GIFFORD: It is reversible error if we 

17 know what went into the training and certification. Was 

18 that training and certification sufficient to prove the 

19 dog was reliable? Did it include the use of blanks and 

did the --

21  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You have, I guess, 

22 experts testify about whether -- what constitutes a good 

23 training program.

agree with you there will be a whole body of experts 

6 that will spring into being about dog training. I 

7 assure you that that will be the case. 

8  MR. GIFFORD: Those experts already exist. 

9 They -- they are prevalent in the case law already.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I understood the Florida 

11 Supreme Court, counselor, to say that the deficit in the 

12 training records here was because there was no evidence 

13 of false positives, that the reports didn't say, the 

14 training reports didn't say, if the dog was alerting 

falsely. 

16  Assume that the record, as your adversary 

17 claimed, shows the opposite, that a satisfactory 

18 completion means that the dog detected drugs where they 

19 were. What -- why wouldn't the training records here be 

adequate in that circumstance? 

21  MR. GIFFORD: That would be one of several 

22 showings that would make the training records adequate. 

23 Also, you would want to know whether there were 

24 distractors used in the field. However, I don't believe

1 arguable; the parties dispute this -- for the

3  All the state had for the initial training 

4 with Deputy Morris, not with Deputy Wheetley, was a 

certificate: One certificate that said this dog was 

6 trained by the Apopka Police Department for 120 hours 

7 with Deputy Morris; another certificate saying that this 

8 dog was certified by Drug Beat narcotics certifications, 

9 again with Deputy Morris, for 1 year.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I guess what I'm 

11 asking you is, as a matter of law you want us to hold 

12 that training records are inadequate unless what? 

13 Unless -- you're going to specify now a list of things 

14 they have to include?

 MR. GIFFORD: No. This Court in -- in a 

16 number of circumstances has provided examples that can 

17 guide a court in probable cause determinations. In 

18 Illinois v. Gates, under the old Aguilar-Spinelli test, 

19 the Court specified where evidence on one prong can be 

so strong that it substitutes for evidence on another 

21 prong. In Ornelas, the Court pointed to local knowledge 

22 that can be relied upon, such as the winter climate in 

23 Milwaukee.

1 says "must." You can't just say, you know, I'm not

4 opinion here in which the Florida Supreme Court says 

"must." It must include the, you know, the field 

6 training. Now, do -- do you disavow that or -- or do 

7 you want us the ignore it? What? 

8  MR. GIFFORD: That is -- that is not the 

9 holding on which I'm relying here. The holding on which 

I'm relying is that training and certification alone, 

11 the mere fact of training and certification alone, is 

12 not sufficient to establish the dog's reliability. 

13  And as to the language about "must," 

14 remember, the Florida Supreme Court didn't just say that 

the failure to produce one of these elements 

16 necessitated reversal. 

17  It then went and engaged in a totality of 

18 the circumstances test. And several lower courts 

19 applying that case, applying Harris, have reached the 

same conclusion. In two of those cases --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if this is absent in 

22 the totality of the circumstances and you nonetheless 

23 hold that there was probable cause, then "must" does not

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not what the 

4 Florida Supreme Court said? It listed, along with 

training, that the -- the provision of records of field 

6 performance. 

7  MR. GIFFORD: I read that as: If those 

8 records exist, the state must produce them, because not 

9 only does it bear the burden of proof; it's the only 

party that can produce these records because it keeps 

11 the dog. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose it's -- it's a 

13 dog that's just completed the training, training course, 

14 top-performing dog in the training program, but there's 

no field record. 

16  MR. GIFFORD: If that -- if the training is 

17 sufficient, if it has those elements that demonstrate 

18 that the dog is reliable, those are the circumstances. 

19 You have the totality of the circumstances there and 

those circumstances don't include any field performance. 

21 And, yes, under that circumstance, a trial court can 

22 find the dog to be reliable. 

23  JUSTICE ALITO: What is wrong with the 

24 state's argument that field performance records are not 

very probative because dogs detect odors, they don't

1 detect the physical presence of the substance that 

2 created the odor, and therefore so-called false alerts, 

3 cases in which a search was performed and no contraband 

4 was found are not really cases of false alerts. What's 

wrong with that? 

6  MR. GIFFORD: Well, you don't know whether 

7 they're cases of false alerts or not, because the state 

8 will always point to the possibility of residual odor as 

9 a reason.  And we know from the studies that have been 

cited in the briefs that there are other reasons that 

11 dogs alert when that alert cannot be verified. Handler 

12 cueing is identified as the chief one. And simply dogs 

13 make mistakes. Dogs err. Dogs get excited and will 

14 alert to things like tennis balls in trunks or animals, 

that sort of thing. 

16  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that may all be true, 

17 but then what -- what can one infer from the fact that a 

18 dog alerted a number of times when no contraband was 

19 found?

 I think what you just said was the 

21 explanation could be the dog detected an odor, but the 

22 substance wasn't there, or it could be that the dog was 

23 cued or the dog was confused or the dog is not very 

24 competent. So what can one infer from these field 

performance records?

1  MR. GIFFORD: Well, what you can infer is
 

2 this dog is not a very accurate indicator of probable
 

3 cause, because probable cause tests whether drugs are
 

4 likely to be found in a search that follows an alert.
 

If the dog's --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: But they are likely to be 

7 found if there is a residual odor of drugs, even though 

8 the drugs are no longer there. So it's not an 

9 incompetent dog when he alerts because of the residual 

odor. 

11  MR. GIFFORD: But if a dog has -- but if a 

12 dog has previously alerted and no drugs have been found 

13 because the dog's hyperacuity causes him to smell drugs 

14 that were there two days or two weeks ago, then the next 

time that dog alerts, it's less likely, the probability 

16 declines that drugs will be found. 

17  It goes to what probable cause measures, 

18 rather than what the dog training and certification 

19 community measure, and that is, the likelihood, the 

reasonable probability, that drugs will be found 

21 following the search. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, how is that any 

23 different than a police officer who comes to a car and 

24 smells marijuana? He's never going to know whether 

there is any more in the car or not. It could have been

1 smoked up an hour before. I don't know how long 

2 marijuana lingers for, but -- I'm not sure why residual 

3 odor affects the reliability of the dog, which was 

4 Justice Scalia's point. It's no different than an 

officer who smells something. 

6  He doesn't actually know whether it's 

7 physically still present or not, but we're talking about 

8 probabilities. 

9  MR. GIFFORD: That's correct. And -- and 

the difference is that -- that the police officer can 

11 describe what he has smelled and can say, I smell 

12 marijuana. All the dog tells the police officer is, I 

13 smell something I was trained to detect, perhaps, if I'm 

14 operating correctly.

 But getting to this -- this issue of 

16 residual odor, our position is that an alert where no 

17 drugs are found means that the dog -- that -- it 

18 detracts from probable cause in that instance. 

19  But that's not the only rule available to 

the court. Residual odor, whether an alert was to 

21 residual odor and is therefore correct and accurate, is 

22 something that can be litigated. 

23  In one of the lower courts that decided the 

24 case after the Florida Supreme Court, the court looked 

to the field performance records, and it found several

1 of them well supported on the issue of whether the alert 

2 was probably to the odor of drugs; several it didn't 

3 find. So that is an issue that can be litigated. 

4  Another possibility is --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, excuse me. 

6 Where -- when nothing is found, how can you tell whether 

7 the dog alerted to a residual odor or simply made a 

8 mistake? 

9  Now, there may be cases where there is other 

evidence that suggests that drugs were present in that 

11 location, and, therefore, that is something from which 

12 you could infer that the dog was alerting to residual 

13 odor; but, the fact that you don't have evidence of that 

14 doesn't mean that there wasn't residual odor.

 MR. GIFFORD: No, it doesn't mean that there 

16 wasn't residual odor. But, again, you go back to what 

17 probable cause measures, I believe. 

18  And the Florida Supreme Court didn't demand 

19 evidence of residual odor. What it did is it said that 

if field performance records exist, then the state can 

21 explain unverified alerts in the field as residual odor, 

22 and then a court can then evaluate that. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's the magic 

24 number? What percentage of accurate alerts or 

inaccurate is enough for probable cause?

Official 

1  MR. GIFFORD: Well, this Court has always 

2 hesitated to assign percentages to probable cause; but, 

3 in the lower courts, once you get below 50 percent, 

4 probable cause is much less likely to be found, assuming 

that there is no other corroborative evidence, no other 

6 reasonable suspicion factors. 

7  I'd like to talk briefly about the Oregon 

8 supreme court and what that court did in several cases. 

9  Helzer and Foster decided in 2011, 

independently of the Florida Supreme Court decision, 

11 doesn't cite Harris; in Foster, the Oregon supreme court 

12 had a dog that trained initially with the same handler, 

13 unlike here, where the evidence was very strong as to 

14 the features of the training and certification program, 

and where that dog had, I believe, a 66 percent field 

16 performance record. 

17  Now, the court in Foster said that the dog's 

18 reliability can be established by training, 

19 certification, and performance in the field. The court 

added that it didn't think that performance in the field 

21 was the most reliable measure, but it's relevant, and 

22 the court considered that 66 percent percentage. 

23  But then, on the same day, in Helzer, there 

24 was a dog that trained initially with a different 

handler, that the handler ultimately testified to very

Official 

1 few details of the ongoing training and the
 

2 certification.
 

3  In Foster, the certification was with an
 

4 organization that required a 90 percent success rate.
 

In Helzer, there was no such testimony.
 

6  And this officer, like the officer here,
 

7 didn't keep field performance records when the dog
 

8 alerted and no drugs were found.
 

9  In Helzer, the court found that there was
 

insufficient evidence of reliability. And I believe 

11 that those two cases demonstrate what is a -- what is a 

12 correct line to draw in navigating what is reliable. 

13  On several arguments made by the state, the 

14 argument was that the maintenance training included 

blanks, and that the dog did not alert to blanks. The 

16 record, we believe, supports the Florida supreme court's 

17 conclusion that blanks were tested -- the dog was tested 

18 on blanks, but there was no testimony as to whether the 

19 dog didn't alert on those blanks.

 The state has said that the dog was 

21 subsequently recertified. I don't find support in the 

22 record for that. At a suppression hearing, the state 

23 argued -- the officer testified that the dog was 

24 scheduled for another certification, but we don't know 

whether the dog was ever recertified.

1  The Court can affirm the Florida Supreme 

2 Court simply on the failure to produce adequate 

3 documentation of certification and initial training, and 

4 on the fact that this dog was never certified with this 

trainer -- with this handler and didn't initially work 

6 with this handler. 

7  You don't have a dog here who was reliable 

8 enough to demonstrate probable cause. The Florida 

9 Supreme Court so concluded. I believe its conclusion 

was correct. And unless there are additional 

11 questions... 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The alert -- the alert 

13 here could have been to residual odor, or it could have 

14 been to drugs inside the pickup truck. If it's --

because the alert was in front of the -- a front door 

16 handle, is that -- so it -- it's equally likely that 

17 it -- that it was just residual odor or that there were 

18 drugs inside the pickup truck. 

19  Can the police establish probable cause 

when what the dog alerted to may well have been residual 

21 odor and nothing inside? The dog didn't alert anyplace 

22 other than the door handle, is that... 

23  MR. GIFFORD: It can constitute probable 

24 cause. What Officer Wheetley testified to in this case 

was he believed that this alert was to residual odor

1 on the door handle --

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me. Did you say it 

3 can or it can't? 

4  MR. GIFFORD: It may. It may. It can 

constitute probable cause in this case. 

6  Officer Wheetley testified that this dog 

7 alerted to the door handle. And in his prior 

8 experience, when the dog alerts to the door handle, it 

9 means that someone who had smoked or consumed drugs or 

handled drugs had touched the door handle. 

11  Now, if Officer Wheetley had testified that 

12 in his experience when he'd seen such alerts and 

13 conducted a search, drugs were found inside the vehicle, 

14 then that residual odor alert would support probable 

cause. 

16  Officer Wheetley did not so testify. There 

17 was insufficient evidence that this residual odor 

18 alert -- that a residual odor alert of this nature, 

19 without finding drugs afterward, supports probable 

cause. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: But at least we don't have 

22 to worry about mothballs in this case; is that right? 

23 There are no mothballs?

2  JUSTICE ALITO: Was that the holding in the 

3 Florida Supreme Court, that there was no probable cause 

4 because the dog alerted to the wrong part of the truck?

 MR. GIFFORD: No, Your Honor. 

6  JUSTICE ALITO: Was it any part of their 

7 reasoning? 

8  MR. GIFFORD: They were concerned about 

9 residual odor alerting without any explanation by the 

state as to how residual odor alerting supports probable 

11 cause. 

12  But the primary basis for its decision was 

13 the lack of performance records and the lack of records 

14 supporting initial training and certification to show 

that this dog was reliable. 

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if we think they were 

17 wrong in that respect, I suppose that you would say the 

18 Court shouldn't reverse, but should vacate and remand 

19 because the question did alert him to the door handle, 

was that enough? Was that enough to establish probable 

21 cause that there were drugs in the vehicle? 

22  MR. GIFFORD: Well, I don't think the door 

23 handle itself is -- is dispositive. I think it's the 

24 door handle plus the lack of evidence that we have a 

reliable dog.

1  And, again, the reason you need a reliable 

2 dog, evidence on what training and certification means, 

3 is that there are no standards, no standards whatsoever 

4 for initial training.

 Some states do have standards for training 

6 and certification. Florida does not. And no standards 

7 for -- for maintenance training as well. 

8  In order to have probable cause, you have to 

9 know what that certification, what that training means, 

if you don't have standards that will tell that for you.

12 conclude.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE 

16  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

17  MR. GARRE: Thank you, Your Honor. 

18  First, probable cause in this Court's 

19 precedents looks not only to the likelihood that 

contraband would be present, but the likelihood that 

21 there would be evidence of a crime. And that would 

22 include the so-called residual odor, evidence that drug 

23 paraphernalia, someone had recently smoked illegal 

24 narcotics in the vehicle, or the like.

 So the alert to the so-called residual odor

1 of drugs is just as probative to the question of
 

2 probable cause as an alert to drugs themselves.
 

3  The fact that Aldo alerted to the door
 

4 handle area of the car doesn't negate in any way the
 

probable cause that Officer Wheetley had to search. 

6 What it means is that the door handle area was where the 

7 scent of the illegal narcotics was the strongest. It 

8 could have been narcotics coming out of that area, or 

9 coming out of the door seam, or could have been the fact 

that someone who had used narcotics was using the door 

11 handle to get in and out of the car. 

12  Second, courts can determine reliability in 

13 this context. They would look to the performance in the 

14 controlled training environment. There is a real danger 

with suggesting that field performance records are --

16 are a permissible foray for defendants in suppression 

17 hearings to challenge the reliability of dogs because, 

18 one, as Justice Alito pointed out, it's not a controlled 

19 setting.

 We don't know whether the dog did alert to 

21 residual odors of narcotics that had been in the car, 

22 drugs that were hidden and simply not found during 

23 the relatively --

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Would you -- would you

1  MR. GARRE: I think they could ask about it, 

2 Your Honor. I don't think they could demand the 

3 performance records themselves. And that would be a 

4 huge deterrent to law enforcement, even maintaining 

those records. 

6  Third, Officer Wheetley and Aldo did train 

7 together for nearly a year before the search in 

8 question. They did complete the 40-hour drug detection 

9 seminar at the Dothan, Alabama, police department. And 

that certificate's at page 105 of the record. 

11  And second, as Justice Scalia pointed out, 

12 all the incentives in this area are aligned with 

13 ensuring the reliability of drug detection dogs. It's 

14 not in the police interest to have a dog that is 

inaccurate in finding contraband or that is inaccurate 

16 and putting an officer in harm's way. 

17  Humans have relied upon dogs for law 

18 enforcement-related purposes, due to their extraordinary 

19 sense of smell, for centuries. Dogs, trained drug 

detection dogs and explosive detection dogs, are 

21 invaluable members of the law enforcement community 

22 today. 

23  We would ask the Court to reverse the 

24 decision below, which would act as a serious detriment 

to the use of that valuable tool.
