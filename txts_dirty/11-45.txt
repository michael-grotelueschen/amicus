CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 11-45, Elgin v. Department of 

the Treasury. 

Mr. Schwartz. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY A. SCHWARTZ 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The question in this case is whether it is 

fairly discernible from the Civil Service Reform Act 

that Congress revoked the district court jurisdiction to 

declare acts of Congress unconstitutional in actions 

brought by Federal employees. The answer is no, for 

several reasons. 

First, the Civil Service Reform Act doesn't 

say that it precludes section 1331 jurisdiction. 

Congress could have said so. Congress didn't say so. 

And there's no inference of preclusion of the 

Petitioners' claims that's fairly discernible from the 

scheme itself. And that's because challenges to 

constitutionality of statutes are just not the type of 

claims that are reviewed through the CSRA scheme. 

Because of this, the Merit Systems

Protection Board dismisses challenge -- challenges to 

constitutionality of a statute routinely as outside of 

its authority. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Schwartz --

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- suppose an employee is 

fired and he has a variety of different kinds of claims, 

constitutional and statutory. What would you think 

happens then? Does he bring the constitutional claims 

in one court but the statutory claims in another 

court -- excuse me -- in the -- in the commission? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: No, Your Honor. I believe 

that, because of normal rules against splitting of 

claims, the employee would have to make a decision. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that seems just as 

bad. In other words, that then, you -- it's not 

inefficient necessarily, but your scheme would force the 

employee to choose between her constitutional claims and 

her statutory claims. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: That is correct. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Why would we do that? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Because of the importance of 

making the constitutional claims available in -- in a --

for judicial review. That is -- that's just one of the 

options that the employee would have to weigh.

JUSTICE ALITO: Why would you make 

that concession? Why wouldn't it be possible in that --

for an employee to choose? If the employee had both 

constitutional and nonconstitutional claims, perhaps 

that employee could take advantage of the review scheme 

that's outlined by the Government. But in the situation 

where there's purely a challenge to a statute, the 

employee would have the option of bringing the claim in 

one of the district courts. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: That -- that certainly is a 

possibility, Your Honor. And -- and it is a possibility 

that the employee could bring his constitutional claim 

in the district court and still pursue his statutory 

claim before the Merit Systems Protection Board. 

However, I'd like to point out that, while this is an 

interesting hypothetical, we don't have to look at 

hypotheticals in this situation because we have in the 

Third Circuit since 1986 and in the District of Columbia 

Circuit since 1995 -- those two circuits permit Federal 

employees to bring their constitutional claims in the 

circuit court. 

We were unable to find a single instance in 

which there has been one of these mixed claims of a -- a 

constitutional claim and a statutory claim brought in 

those circuits.

JUSTICE SCALIA: In -- in those cases, did 

the -- did the plaintiffs also have nonconstitutional 

claims which they were pursuing in the Federal Circuit? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: We -- we were unable to -- to 

find any example of -- of that happening. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, well, that's -- that's 

the problem here. I mean, yes, if all you have is a 

constitutional claim, I suppose the system you propose 

would work. You go to the district court. But where --

where you have both, it's a problem. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: I -- and I -- I agree that 

that is a more difficult situation. But it's not the 

situation presented by the facts of this case at least. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: You suggested that it's a 

situation that doesn't often arise, and I guess that 

puzzles me. Why wouldn't it often arise? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: I don't know why it doesn't 

often arise. It -- it might be that -- that people 

prefer to leave their claims in the Merit Systems 

Protection Board. And --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you --

aspect of the claim? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Your Honor, if -- if an 

employee is fired because of his religion, there's --

there's a -- a separate procedure for discrimination 

claims such as could be brought under Title VII -- and, 

in fact, those claims do go directly to the district 

court. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, because -- well, 

let's -- then I have to do a new hypothetical. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because he gave a -- a 

speech --

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- saying there's no 

global warming or something. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. That claim now could be 

brought before the Merit Systems Protection Board, and I 

agree that -- that it can be brought before the Merit 

Systems Protection Board, and I'm not urging this Court 

to say that that --

Honor.

claim that there has been unconstitutional action by an 

official. I thought that your point was when you're 

challenging the constitutionality of a statute, then you 

have a right to go to the district court.

on? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. I am drawing a 

distinction between a challenge to the constitutionality 

of a statute, as the Petitioners are doing here, and 

that is beyond the -- the authority of the Merit 

Systems --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you talking about a 

facial challenge to the statute as -- and am I 

understanding you right? A facial challenge goes to the 

district court and a constitutional as-applied challenge 

goes to the commission? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. And -- and that --

that's the procedure. The as-applied challenge -- those 

cases are bread-and-butter cases at the Merit Systems 

Protection Board now. If somebody says I was fired 

because I wrote a letter to the editor that my boss 

didn't like, he's not challenging the constitutional --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- I was leading up 

to the fact, why should there be a difference? If the 

MSPB has this expertise in as-applied, why doesn't it 

have it for facial? I mean, the expertise question 

is -- it can't be a matter of expertise; or am I wrong 

about that? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, I would -- with due 

respect, I -- I disagree with you, Your Honor. The

expertise required to decide the present Petitioners' 

claim and the letter to the editor claim is totally 

different. In the letter to the editor claim, the facts 

concern the facts of the workplace, what was my boss's 

motivation, what were his actual reasons for firing me. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, and whether that 

reason was justifiable. And isn't it the case that 

whenever the reason is an unconstitutional reason, you 

would have an as-applied challenge, right? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, why do you need a 

facial challenge in addition? I thought that we always 

try to do as-applied first and facial second. So, why 

isn't it enough that you can go to the Merit Systems 

Protection Board and then to the Federal Circuit saying 

that this action was wrong and not allowed under the 

statute? And -- and if -- if the reason it was wrong 

was that it was unconstitutional, what's -- what's the 

problem? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Justice Scalia, I -- I agree 

that in the as-applied challenge where somebody says my 

rights were violated, that case now goes and should go 

to the Merit Systems Protection Board. In the present 

case, there's no challenge to the application of a 

statute. There's no challenge to any decision that was

decision made by Congress --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, that is the 

rule --

MR. SCHWARTZ: -- in enacting the Civil --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the rule that 

you would apply across the board so long -- only in the 

case of a facial challenge do you get to go to the 

district court? If it's an as-applied -- this law was 

unconstitutional as applied to me -- that's still before 

the MSPB? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. And -- and --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me how --

MR. SCHWARTZ: And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- how -- how this is 

any different than the administrative system and review 

system that was reviewed in Thunder Basin and Illinois 

Long-Term Care? In both those statutes, the agencies 

weren't permitted to consider facial challenges, 

constitutional challenges; and we said that's okay, they 

can't, but the reviewing court can. So, how's that any 

different from the situation you're proposing here? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. There are several 

significant differences. I'd like to -- I'd like to go 

through them.

First of all, in the Thunder Basin case, 

the -- the constitutional challenge was -- was to the 

procedures that were being applied. The agency, the 

Mine Safety Commission, was -- was an expert in those 

procedures. The facts that were involved in making that 

determination were the very facts that this Mine Safety 

Commission had expertise in. 

In the present case, the challenge is to the 

Selective Service laws. The Merit Systems Protection 

Board --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But please deal with the 

language of both cases. Both cases said even if the 

agency can't review a constitutional challenge, there's 

still review within the Federal Circuit -- within the --

within the circuit courts, and that's okay. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, why isn't that okay 

here? I think that was Justice Scalia's question to 

you. I know that you say, well, the Federal Circuit 

won't have a record. But the Government says if it 

wants a record, it can remand and ask the agency to 

develop it. So, what's wrong with that procedure? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: The first thing that's 

wrong -- that's wrong with that procedure as it would be 

applied to this case is that it's -- it's a vast

departure from the Civil Service Reform Act scheme as it 

was created by Congress; and -- and -- because that 

scheme involves the Merit Systems Protection Board 

acting as a trial court; and -- and giving the first 

level of review and in effect substituting for the --

for a district court. And then --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't one of the 

challenges here by one of the Petitioners that he was 

constructively discharged? Isn't that an issue that the 

board is better suited to determine in the first 

instance, whether there was at all a constructive 

discharge? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, in fact, it's -- it's 

just the reverse of that, where that one Petitioner 

would be taking the position that he was not 

constructively discharged. If he was constructively 

discharged, the Merit Systems Protection Board arguably 

would have jurisdiction. If he voluntarily resigned, 

under the Government's theory, he would be among the 

class of Federal employees -- constitutes about a third 

of Federal employees -- who have no appellate rights to 

the Merit Systems Protection Board. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought your position 

was that the Merit Systems Protection Board has said we

questions, period. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, I thought that the 

court was saying this claim is dismissed because we 

don't have jurisdiction to deal with that kind of 

question. And then your next -- the Federal Circuit --

well, how can the Federal Circuit exercise jurisdiction 

over a claim where the first-instance decisionmaker said 

it didn't have authority to render the decision? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that that's 

what your position was. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: That is what our position is, 

and -- and it leaves open the question of just what the 

Federal Circuit is going to do after the Merit Systems 

Protection Board has dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's not your 

position, as I understood it, in your response to my 

earlier question. You said that the -- it is all right 

to have as-applied constitutional challenges presented 

to the MSPB or not presented but then reviewed in the 

Federal Circuit. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: My position is that if the 

MSPB has jurisdiction to find a statute -- that since 

the MSPB does not have jurisdiction to find a statute

unconstitutional, any claim in which the employee is 

asking for them to find a statute unconstitutional is 

one that is outside of the CSRA scheme. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, but -- but 

within the statutory scheme, are you saying that a claim 

that this statute is, while not facially 

unconstitutional, unconstitutional as applied to me --

does -- where does that claim go? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: My confusion is about the use 

of the term "as applied." And I -- rather than using 

terms such as "facial" or "as applied" where the 

dividing line can be somewhat blurry, I propose drawing 

the dividing line between a case where the employee is 

saying this statute is unconstitutional; I'm saying 

Congress made a mistake --

with your argument. The dividing line should be where 

the MSPB itself could decide the claim. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: If the MSPB can decide the 

claim, then it goes to the MSPB. If the MSPB can't 

decide the claim, I think is what you're saying, then 

it has to go to the district court. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: And you're saying that the 

MSPB has said that, although it can decide, can decide, 

cases where he says, you know, my -- my supervisor fired 

me for a discriminatory reason, that that's within the 

scope of the MSPB's authority, a claim like this, which 

is that the Selective Service Act is unconstitutional 

full stop, is not within the scope of the MSPB's 

authority. Is that right? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes, that's absolutely 

correct. And -- and the cases that would not be within 

the MSPB's authority would include cases where the 

employee says the statute is unconstitutional and would 

also include the million or so Federal employees who, as 

the Government says, have no appellate rights to the 

MSPB, all -- all of those persons, career -- those 

persons would include summer interns, FBI employees.

Federal bureaucracy that we don't have to really give,

I assume, because it's the sensitive nature of what they 

deal with. 

So, I guess what I'm saying is, do you want 

us to focus on the millions of employees who would now 

be going to district court or do you want us to focus on 

the small number that have facial constitutional 

challenges?

They're precluded under the Administrative Procedures 

Act. That's this Court's Fausto decision. And in this 

Court's Fausto decision, a Federal employee who could 

not bring a case -- his appeal to the Merit Systems 

Protection Board tried to bring a Back Pay Act claim in 

the Court of Claims and this court said, no, that is 

precluded. 

And what the Government is doing is saying 

you got a right in Fausto, but for constitutional 

claims, Mr. Fausto had it right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but that's -- that's 

entirely logical. Fausto in effect said that the 

statutory structure simply provides no cause of action 

for these people, okay? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: They're not entitled to 

anything. But I don't think that there's anything in 

the -- in the civil service laws that say these people 

are not entitled to constitutional protections. So, I 

don't think that -- that Fausto rules this out. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Well, and I -- I agree with you 

completely that -- that constitutional claims are 

different from statutory claims --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And it's those that I say 

that people not covered by appeals to the Merit Systems 

Protection Board -- they can bring those constitutional 

claims, even though they can't bring statutory claims. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. And that's -- that's 

the position I'm taking. I'm taking it a step beyond 

the Government, however. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. You're taking -- I'm 

saying that's true only with respect to those people who 

have no right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection 

Board. You're going further.

Board, right, can go directly to the district court? 

That's a different question. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: But I -- I'm limiting that to 

those people who can appeal to the Merit Systems 

Protection Board, but the Merit Systems Protection Board 

has no authority to grant them relief.

respect to your argument. There's a claim that -- that 

the agency acted in an unconstitutional manner, not that 

any statute is unconstitutional --

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- but there's 

unconstitutional executive action. There's an as-

applied claim. Let's say that a plaintiff says that the 

registration requirement is unconstitutional as applied 

to me, not to other people, but to me because I'm a 

conscientious objector or I have religious objections to 

military action that the United States is taking at this 

particular time. And then there's this -- there's a 

claim that this statute is unconstitutional on its face. 

Now, where do you -- which of those can the 

Merit Systems Protection Review Board decide? Just the 

first category? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Just the first category. 

JUSTICE ALITO: So, it's not a distinction 

between as-applied and facial? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: No. No, no. And that's --

that's -- that's why -- that's why I'm specifically not 

trying to say where the line is between as-applied and 

facial.

to the district court. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: That is absolutely correct. 

And --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Now, in your original briefs, 

Mr. Schwartz, you suggested that if the MSPB can't hear 

a claim, neither can the Federal Circuit. And as I 

understood the Government's brief, the Government comes 

back and said that's not the case. Even when the MSPB 

can't hear a claim, the Federal Circuit could hear it. 

Now, then there's a question of, if there's a necessity 

for a record, how does the record get developed? 

But do you now concede that the Federal 

Circuit could hear the claim as a matter -- you know, on 

the -- at the -- at the first level? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: I agree that a system can be 

proposed to get these claims to the Federal Circuit. 

However, it's not the system of the -- that Congress 

created in the Civil Service Reform Act. And the 

significance of the contortions that have to be gone 

through to get these claims to the Federal Circuit 

demonstrates that it's not fairly discernible from the 

Civil Service Reform Act as written by Congress that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you take the position 

that the MSPB, having no jurisdiction and saying it has 

no jurisdiction, it can't adjudicate this matter, well,

then, a reviewing court has no jurisdiction to -- to 

review? There's nothing to review because the MSPB said 

we have no jurisdiction. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: That's how it would work in 

the real world. I mean, what is -- what is the Federal 

Circuit supposed to do? It has an order from the MSPB 

that says we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The 

Federal Circuit -- and the Government doesn't say that 

that is wrong. The Federal Circuit says we affirm your 

dismissal, and now we'll move on to the merits. That --

it's possible we could have a system like that, but that 

isn't the system of the Civil Service Reform Act, and 

that's not the way that appellate courts normally 

function. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it really a 

question of jurisdiction of the MSPB? 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: "Jurisdiction" is a 

word with many meanings. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Yes. And -- and -- and 

there's a general rule with that -- there have been 

exceptions to -- that administrative agencies do not 

have authority to rule on constitutionality of statutes.

says -- the employee says I was dismissed. MSPB says

that's right, you were, and it's lawful. The employee

we can't. The Federal Circuit says but we can; so, make 

your argument. What's the problem? And then I'll 

decide it. And if they decide it's unconstitutional, 

then the action of the MSPB is wrong. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: That's a system that -- that 

could come up. It's not the system of the Civil Service

Systems Protection Board is not going to say we affirm 

your dismissal or that -- it's not going to reach the 

merits. It's going to -- it's going to get the 

paperwork. The government is going to --

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine, fine. What they say

to your dismissal was unconstitutional.

they say they're right that they didn't, but you do; so, 

will you please decide that this statute is 

unconstitutional? What's the problem?

JUSTICE BREYER: Ah. It may be unusual. I

there isn't one. I want to know what's the problem with

MR. SCHWARTZ: Okay. The problem, if that 

is the system that's going to be in place, is that it's 

not quite that straightforward. It's -- at first, the 

employee has to file his claim in the MSPB with 

everybody knowing it's going to be dismissed. He then 

appeals that dismissal to the Federal Circuit, which 

affirms the dismissal, says, yes, MSPB has no 

jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, it doesn't affirm the 

dismissal. It says the dismissal was unconstitutional; 

go reinstate him.

extensive factual discovery in Rostker. So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that your point was 

and hasn't the Federal Circuit said that the MSPB has no 

jurisdiction to decide we have no jurisdiction to 

review. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: That's what the Federal 

Circuit had said. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that an appellate 

court is reviewing a court of first instance. The 

scheme that has been proposed would turn the Federal 

Circuit into a court of first instance, rather than an 

appellate court. 

MR. SCHWARTZ: And that is why what's 

proposed by the Government is such a departure from the 

CSRA scheme as written by Congress, in which MSPB has 

first-instance jurisdiction; the Federal Circuit has 

appellate jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, isn't your basic 

answer to Justice Breyer -- I mean, correct me if I'm 

wrong -- you think that the problem is that there's no 

record that the Federal Circuit can use to evaluate this 

constitutional claim?

there's one you have to have factual development, and I

and may it please the Court: 

I'd like to begin if I could by addressing the 

question asked by Justice Kagan, which is why shouldn't 

the scope of the MSPB's authority be the test for 

determining whether a claim can be filed in district 

court? 

And I think using that as the test would 

lead to unclear and easily manipulated jurisdictional 

rules. Among other things, it often won't be clear up 

front whether the MSPB can resolve an employee's claim 

or not. A claim that appears at first blush to 

challenge a statute's constitutionality might be 

resolved, for instance, by interpreting the statute to 

avoid the constitutional question, which is something 

that the MSPB could do. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: We could just ask the 

MSPB, Mr. Feigin. If you bring the claim to the MSPB, 

and then the MSPB says, no, we have no authority to 

adjudicate this claim, then you know that you're in a 

world in which the MSPB doesn't have authority, so that 

you can go to the district court. 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, I don't think that's 

consistent with the CSRA, Your Honor, because the way 

the CSRA works is that you go to the MSPB first, and 

then you go to the Federal Circuit. And I think

everyone agrees that the Federal --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but the CSRA is 

presuming that the MSPB actually can decide something. 

MR. FEIGIN: I don't think it's presuming 

that any more than 42 U.S.C. 405(g) was presuming that 

in Illinois Council or the Mine Act was presuming that 

in Thunder Basin Coal. That is, that it's often useful 

to have constitutional claims presented to an agency in 

the first instance, even if the agency can't resolve 

those claims, because it allows the agency to figure 

out -- for example, in the case that this Court was 

discussing with Mr. Schwartz about circumstances where 

there might be nonconstitutional claims and 

constitutional claims, the agency might be able to moot 

out the case on nonconstitutional grounds. The 

constitutional --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feigin, those --

those statutes to which you refer said that no action on 

the claim -- well, this was Social Security benefits --

no action shall be brought under 1331. There is no such 

provision here. 

MR. FEIGIN: That was true in Illinois 

Council and some of the other cases we cite. But in --

in Thunder Basin, the Court was very clear that the 

statute was facially silent as to the preclusion of

pre-enforcement claims like the sort that were at issue 

in Thunder Basin. The Court nevertheless held that the 

claim in Thunder Basin was precluded, and it held that 

even though it acknowledged that it might be possible 

that the constitutional claim that was raised by the 

plaintiff in that case couldn't be addressed in first 

instance by the Mine Commission. 

Now, the MSPB here is very analogous to the 

Mine Commission. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, could you help me with 

something? Because I agree with you, Thunder Basin is a 

very strong case for you, but McNary is a very strong 

case for Mr. Schwartz. And I read those two opinions, 

and, frankly, I have a tough time reconciling them. So, 

could you tell me how you do? 

MR. FEIGIN: We prefer Thunder Basin, Your 

Honor. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, I imagine so. 

MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, I think, as we 

suggest in our brief, McNary actually presented a very 

specialized circumstance in several respects. First of 

all, there was a special statutory provision in that 

case that limited judicial review of -- in that case, to 

the record that had already been developed, and that's

not true here. 

Second, the Court was very concerned in 

McNary that if the plaintiffs weren't allowed to bring 

their claims in district court, they wouldn't be able to 

receive any meaningful judicial review at all. 

Now, here, the plaintiffs in this case can 

get meaningful judicial review from the Federal Circuit, 

which everyone agrees has the authority to resolve a 

constitutional challenge to a statute. 

Now, if I could, I'd like to address I think 

some confusion, as the Chief Justice was noting, over 

the meaning of the term "jurisdiction" and exactly what 

would happen if the Petitioners had brought this case in 

the first instance to the MSPB. 

Now, before getting into this, I'd like to 

acknowledge that when Petitioner Elgin did bring this 

case to the MSPB, the government argued that the MSPB 

had no jurisdiction. We have conceded below and we 

concede here that we were wrong about that. We do not 

think Elgin should be prejudiced by the government's 

position. If he were to file a motion now to reopen his 

case with the MSPB, the Government would support that. 

Here's how it should have worked if the 

government --

MR. FEIGIN: Our answer -- our answer --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Will they be able -- if 

the -- if the commission says, no, we won't reopen, do 

they have any avenue now to go to the Federal Circuit? 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, they can appeal that 

decision to the Federal Circuit, and the Government will 

again support the fact that the case ought to be 

reopened. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Please finish with your 

answer. 

MR. FEIGIN: And let me now address what 

should have happened when the case went to the MSPB. 

The MSPB would have had jurisdiction over the case in 

the sense that the challenge to the adverse action is 

properly before the MSPB. I think that's very clear 

under 5 U.S.C. 7513(d) and 5 U.S.C. 7701(a), which grant 

the MSPB jurisdiction over adverse actions under the 

CSRA. 

Now, the MSPB would not be able to 

adjudicate the constitutionality, would not be able to 

issue an order striking down a Federal statute. And to 

determine that that would be what would be necessary 

here in order to grant the plaintiffs relief, what it

build up the administrative record for review --

pause --

MR. FEIGIN: Yes.

question? So, the government -- if Mr. Schwartz comes 

in before the MSPB and says we have three witnesses who 

are going to testify only on the constitutional issue; I 

have this volume of evidence about what's happening in 

the military; it's only relevant in the constitutional 

issue; and, you know, it's going to take us 2 days to 

present this -- the government is going to say it's okay 

with us, right? 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor --

object that that's beyond the jurisdiction of the agency 

to decide. 

MR. FEIGIN: We will not object that it's 

not beyond the jurisdiction of the agency to decide --

MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think this 

is fairly analogous, although not perfectly analogous, 

to the fairly common circumstance where, for example, a 

district court reserves to itself a decision on the 

merits of an action and then delegates to a magistrate 

judge decisions on discovery. Now, the only 

limitation --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But they're very different 

because the magistrate can come back to the district 

court judge and say we have a tough one, Your Honor; why 

don't you decide it? 

I mean, here you're stipulating that the 

board has no power to decide this question. Call it 

jurisdiction; call it something else. The board cannot 

decide the question, but the board is going to now 

become the arbiter of discovery disputes? The 

factfinder? I mean, "weird" is a good word for it. 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, first of all, Your Honor, 

the only thing that we think the MSPB lacks authority to 

do, the only thing, is to issue an order on the merits 

declaring a Federal statute unconstitutional. It is 

competent to resolve discovery disputes --

into the merits of the constitutional claim? In other 

words, the parties can just put in any evidence they 

want? 

MR. FEIGIN: Well --

JUSTICE ALITO: Any evidence they think 

might be possibly be relevant to the case, they can put 

that in. It can be discovery of anything. 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, there may be disputes as 

to the scope of discovery. And those -- resolution of 

those disputes may touch on the merits. We think the 

MSPB can do all of that. The only thing the MSPB lacks 

authority to do, according to the MSPB, is to issue an 

order striking down a Federal statute as 

unconstitutional. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you think the MSPB should 

find facts with regard to this claim? 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, first of all, Your Honor, 

I think this case isn't going to require any factfinding 

because I think it's worth noting that both judges that 

have addressed Petitioners' arguments on the merits, the

claim without factfinding. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: I would think, Mr. Feigin, 

it would depend on how it's litigated. But in a case in 

which there is some factfinding to be made, would the 

MSPB have authority to find facts? 

MR. FEIGIN: Yes, it would, Your Honor. 

Now, I'd like to add that in many cases --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you go back and tell 

me when the government changed its position? It was my 

understanding that up until, well, certainly this case 

was litigated, the government was taking the position 

MSPB has no jurisdiction to pass on the 

constitutionality of a statute. 

When did the government back away from that 

position? When did it say, no, we were wrong; they do 

have jurisdiction? 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I need to 

separate out two things. First, it is still our 

position that the MSPB has no authority to declare a 

Federal statute unconstitutional. Now, the government 

was taking the position that in cases where an employee 

had been removed pursuant to a statutory bar, that the 

MSPB lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal of -- of a 

case like that. 

And the reason the government argued was not

because the MSPB lacked authority to decide the 

constitutionality of a statute, although we believe 

that, too, but because the government was arguing 

erroneously that an employee who is removed based on a 

statutory bar that should have prevented his hiring in 

the first place wasn't an employee within the meaning of 

5 U.S.C. 7511. Now the government no longer takes that 

5 U.S.C. 7511 position. We've been consistent on that 

in the court of appeals and in this Court, and, 

therefore, we believe that the MSPB did properly have 

jurisdiction over the action in this case. 

Now, when it goes up to the MSPB, the MS --

and after -- the MSPB would then deny relief on the 

merits because it would lack the authority to declare a 

Federal statute unconstitutional. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't want to delay you; 

so, don't pause too long. But I've just been curious --

where did this rule -- is there a statute or something 

that says an agency can't say that this action would be 

unconstitutional? Where does that idea come from? 

MR. FEIGIN: So, there is not a statute, 

Your Honor. This Court has said in several cases that 

administrative agencies generally lack the authority to 

declare a statute unconstitutional. It's clear from 

Thunder Basin that that isn't a constitutional

limitation on the authority of Federal agencies. That 

is to say, if Congress wanted to give an agency the 

authority to adjudicate the constitutionality of a 

statute, it could. And the Court noted that the Mine 

Commission in Thunder Basin believed it did have the 

authority to adjudicate the constitutionality of 

statutes, although the Court didn't reach whether the 

Mine Commission was correct about that. 

And in this case, the MSPB believes, 

consistent with this Court's repeated statements, that 

it lacks authority to adjudicate the constitutionality 

of statutes. 

Now, if the Court decides that the best way 

to reconcile this scheme would simply be to say that the 

MSPB does have the authority to adjudicate the 

constitutionality of statutes, I think that would make 

much more sense than the position the Petitioners are 

urging. And here's an example, I think, that 

illustrates why the position the Petitioners are urging 

will lead to confusion of jurisdictional rules and 

manipulation of jurisdictional rules. 

So, if you imagine two employees who were 

fired by an employing agency for leaking information to 

the press, confidential information to the press, they 

both challenge their removals, but they raise slightly

different arguments. The first one says, well, I don't 

think the employment statute should be construed to 

allow me to be fired for this reason because I think the 

employment statute should be construed with First 

Amendment principles in mind and shouldn't reach this 

case. 

The second one says I concede that the 

employment statutes allow my firing for this reason, but 

I think those -- I think that statute is 

unconstitutional as applied. 

Now, those are really the same claim and --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Feigin, they might 

well be the same claim, but if the MSPB can decide the 

one and cannot decide the other, that's a relevant 

distinction. Now, you might be right in what you said. 

Well, maybe one answer is that the MSPB can decide both. 

But as long as the MSPB can decide the one or the other, 

it seems -- I mean, that's -- it seems like a sensible 

dividing line. 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, even if the 

MSPB lacks the authority to strike down a Federal 

statute, I still think it might be able to adjudicate 

the claim of the employee, the second employee, who 

brings it as an as-applied challenge because the Court 

would -- I'm sorry; not the Court -- the MSPB could

decide that case on the same constitutional avoidance 

grounds that are -- that are urged by the first 

employee. 

That is, they really are the same case. 

Before striking down a statute as constitutional, this 

Court all the time, it instructs lower courts, and this 

would be true of agencies, too, should interpret the 

statute to avoid any significant constitutional 

question. 

JUSTICE ALITO: But they're not at all the 

same claim. They're related, but one says the statute 

means something; and insofar as it's applied to a 

particular situation, it's unconstitutional. The other 

one says it doesn't mean that. 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I think they 

are the same in the respect that, as I was just saying 

to Justice Kagan, if the MSPB --

JUSTICE ALITO: When we -- just let me rephrase 

that. If -- if this Court adopts a certain 

interpretation based on the principle of constitutional 

avoidance, do you think the Court is rewriting the 

statute? 

MR. FEIGIN: No, Your Honor, but there may 

be ambiguity in a statute that the Court interprets to 

avoid a significant constitutional question. So, maybe

I can give another example that might flesh this out a 

little bit. 

There's a statute, 5 U.S.C. 7311, that bars 

from Federal employment people who have participated in 

strikes. Now, it's easy to think of an employee who 

raises a factual or statutory challenge to that claim. 

He says that what he did wasn't participating in a 

strike, either factually or shouldn't be considered 

participating in a strike within the scope of the 

statute. And he also challenges the statute on 

constitutional grounds. 

And the most common case brought to the 

MSPB, in our experience, that raises a constitutional 

claim also raises the sort of factual and statutory 

claims I was just suggesting. Now, the MSPB might 

resolve that first question -- those first set of 

questions in such a way as to avoid the constitutional 

question by saying that the statute doesn't reach the 

conduct that the particular employee engaged in. 

And if we imagine instead that the employee 

had only brought the constitutional claim, which would 

be kind of a strange way to litigate because he'd be 

giving up arguments on which he might win, I still think 

that the MSPB could decide, look, before we send this 

off to the Federal Circuit and decide that the only way

we can grant you relief is to say that a Federal statute 

is unconstitutional, which is something we don't think 

we can do, we should at least take a look at the statute 

to see whether these somewhat ambiguous terms, 

"participate" and "strike," actually do apply to your 

conduct. 

And by failing to give the MSPB the first 

crack at doing that, what --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any such 

possibility in this case? I mean, the statute says men 

must register for the draft. There's no way to avoid --

to reread that statute to say anything other than that. 

So, I don't -- I don't see any constitutional avoidance. 

MR. FEIGIN: I agree with that, Justice 

Ginsburg. In this case, we don't think the 

constitutional question can be avoided, and we don't 

think the MSPB could have granted relief. But I don't 

think the Court should essentially throw everything out 

just because of this case. Their position is going to 

make for unclear jurisdictional rules, and employees 

aren't going to know where they're entitled to go or 

where they're supposed to go, because --

certainly -- it doesn't appear that there's anything in 

the Act that precludes them from granting any 

appropriate relief with respect to an unlawful 

discharge. Am I correct? 

MR. FEIGIN: That's correct, Your Honor. 

The statute does not, as we explain in our brief, draw 

any distinction between the types of arguments that 

would be made in seeking to set aside an unlawful 

discharge --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Although, that's weird in 

another way, isn't it, Mr. Feigin, because, can we

the Selective Service Act is unconstitutional? I mean, 

what do they know about that question? 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, as everyone agrees and as 

Mr. Schwartz was discussing with the Court, the MSPB 

does have expertise on -- in constitutional claims. The 

MSPB are a set of -- a set of persons that are appointed 

by the President and confirmed by the Senate. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but this is a 

question, and -- and you can -- I take the point that 

I'm just talking about this case. But this is a

Justice Kagan, but the CSRA doesn't draw distinctions

covers. And I think --

that's why our primary position is that the MSPB does 

not have that authority. However --

really what the argument boils down to is -- is if we 

accept your position, there's a kind of procedural

U.S. magistrates, all -- tax courts, all kinds of people

that they can't do it from some kind of lore from 

Kenneth Davis or something or -- what's -- what's the 

basis of this? And wouldn't it be simpler if you just 

said it says they can take appropriate relief? They can 

take appropriate relief, period. End of the matter.

MR. FEIGIN: Well, that treatise is cited, 

for example, by -- the Court cites the Mine Commission 

cases that themselves cite the treatise. But the point 

is, Justice Breyer, even if our rule does have a couple

clear jurisdictional rules.

lack this authority in fact; right? It's not just the 

MSPB's position.

statute unconstitutional, we think Congress would have 

greatly preferred the latter because that preserves 

the -- the basic idea of the CSRA, which was to 

consolidate and streamline judicial review. 

As this Court recognized in Fausto, Congress 

specifically did not want challenges to adverse actions 

to go through district court into the court of appeals 

and get a duplicative and wasteful two-layer judicial 

review. Instead --

JUSTICE ALITO: If anybody who drafted or 

voted for the Civil Service Reform Act had thought about 

a case like this, where it's a pure question of law, a 

facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute, 

do you think they would have said, well, the way we 

think that this should be handled is this scheme that 

you have proposed? 

MR. FEIGIN: I think they would have 

preferred it to a scheme where, first of all, the claims 

go to district court, which is precisely what the CSRA 

was trying to eliminate; and, second of all, to a scheme 

where it becomes confusing and dependent on precisely 

how a plaintiff frames his argument which court winds up 

entertaining the claim.

other -- any other case where an appellate court has 

authority to decide a question that the court of first 

instance lacked authority to decide? I mean, you say 

MSPB says it has no authority, and you agree with that. 

I couldn't think of another case where a 

court of appeals, which is a court of review, not first 

view, substitutes itself for an incompetent court of 

first instance. 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, first of all, 

we cite several examples of courts of appeals deciding 

constitutional questions in the first instance, at pages 

37 to 38 in our brief. Another example would be this 

Court's decision in INS v. Chadha, the legislative veto 

case, which came up from the Board of Immigration 

Appeals. The Board of Immigration Appeals said it 

didn't have authority to adjudicate the separation of 

powers question. It was reviewed by the Ninth Circuit 

and then reviewed by this Court. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Feigin, could I go back 

to the Chief Justice's question about what actually 

would happen in the MSPB? Presumably in this case, what 

the plaintiffs seek to do is to develop an extensive 

factual record showing how much has changed in the 

military in terms of the -- the -- the role that women 

play in the military. And that it's almost impossible

to litigate this kind of claim without having such a 

record. That's the entire basis for -- for arguing that 

Rostker is outmoded, given current military operations. 

So, how could the -- the plaintiff develop that record 

that is needed to litigate this claim? 

MR. FEIGIN: You would develop it in the 

MSPB, either in the first instance on the initial 

appeal, or the MSPB could let it go to the Federal 

Circuit without having developed an administrative 

record. And the Federal Circuit if, unlike either of 

the judges to address the merits in this case, believed 

that a factual record was necessary, it could remand to 

the MSPB with instructions that the MSPB take evidence 

and develop an administrative record. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't like that at all. 

That's ridiculous. Send it back to an agency that has 

no jurisdiction over the question, you know, make 

factfindings on this -- on this question over which you 

have no jurisdiction. 

Can you give any example where -- where that 

occurs elsewhere? Why wouldn't the -- the preferable 

course be to appoint a master, have the Federal Circuit 

appoint a master to do it?

MR. FEIGIN: Well, first of all, Your Honor, 

I think it's actually going to be a fairly rare case in 

which a challenge to a legislative act of passing a 

statute is really going to turn on some sort of factual 

finding -- like a credibility --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, but this is that case. 

MR. FEIGIN: -- like a credibility 

determination or something that's uniquely within the 

competence of a trial court or an agency with trial 

court-like powers. 

I think what might be more common, Justice 

Kagan, is that you might need to develop some sort of 

administrative record. But once the evidence is 

submitted, the conclusions one would draw from that 

evidence will be fairly obvious. For example, in 

Rostker v. Goldberg, there was discovery, there was 

evidence submitted, and then the parties were able to 

stipulate to the facts that would set forth review. 

So, in this case, for example, I don't think 

there's really going to be a dispute that the MSPB is 

going to have to resolve about what sorts of positions 

women can serve in, in the military. I think the 

government is going to be willing to stipulate to that.

matter; even if women can now do 99 percent of the --

the things that are done in the military, the 

Registration Act is still constitutional. Wouldn't you

MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor, I don't --

it can be proven that they've -- that women are now --

that the percentage is now high enough, the statute may 

be unconstitutional?

does it make to develop a big factual record before you 

know whether it's even -- whether it even makes any

constitutional challenge to a statute. As the Court

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wouldn't that be the 

proper way of doing it, if you're going to go up on a 

constitutional claim? Make your offer of proof, and 

then the Federal Circuit can decide if it needs more 

evidence or not. 

MR. FEIGIN: That's where I was going with 

this, Your Honor. In fact, the MSPB has a special 

rule -- I believe it's 5 C.S.R. 1201.61; it's cited in 

our brief -- where even if the MSPB decided not to 

accept evidence for some reason, a description of the 

evidence would go in the record and, therefore, be 

available for the Federal Circuit. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if -- I guess 

that the party doesn't -- doesn't even have to raise its 

constitutional claim before the MSPB, does it? 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, the Federal --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, it's pretty 

odd to say that you've somehow waived a claim you

couldn't pursue. 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, the Federal Circuit has 

in analogous cases decided constitutional claims that 

weren't raised in front of an agency when the agency 

couldn't decide them. In the Government's view, it 

would make sense to exhaust, for the reasons I was 

explaining earlier and to Justice Ginsburg, which is 

that it may be that the MSPB finds that the statute 

doesn't really cover the situation. Now, I acknowledge 

that's not going to happen in this case; it is clear 

that section 3328 required these people's removals. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. You're -- you're 

actually proposing that you have to exhaust questions 

that the agency has no authority to decide? 

MR. FEIGIN: Yes, Your Honor. I think the 

Court has recognized --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Curiouser and curiouser. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA: If you don't bring before 

the agency a question that the agency says it has no 

authority to decide, you have forfeited your ability? 

MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I don't think 

what should happen in this -- in a case like this is 

that the employee appeals to the MSPB and says nothing 

at all. The employee should appeal to the MSPB and at

least say what his constitutional claim is. And the 

benefit of that, as the Court has recognized in, for 

example, Weinberger v. Salfi, is that the agency can 

assure itself, yes, it's a constitutional claim that is 

beyond my authority to resolve, and there's no other way 

for me to resolve it. 

Another benefit of presenting these claims 

to the agency is the MSPB hasn't been crystal clear 

about exactly where its authority begins and ends; and 

neither the Federal Circuit nor this Court has addressed 

that question at all. And allowing the agency in the 

first instance to determine whether it has the authority 

to grant the plaintiff the relief he is seeking has a 

great benefit of clarifying what the scope of the MSPB's 

authority is. It makes a lot more sense for the MSPB 

and the Federal Circuit to be deciding what the scope of 

the MSPB's authority is than it is to file a claim in 

the District of Massachusetts and have that district 

court and then the First Circuit debating about what the 

proper scope of the MSPB's authority is. 

I think the CSRA expresses a clear 

preference that appeals of adverse actions like this go 

through the MSPB and to the Federal Circuit, so that 

they can decide those kinds of questions. Again --

Salfi go? The agency couldn't decide the constitutional 

question. So, what's the next stop? Was it a court of 

appeals or the district court? 

MR. FEIGIN: In Salfi, Your Honor? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 

MR. FEIGIN: That would have been in 

district court. However, under 42 U.S.C. 405(g), which 

was at issue in Salfi and Illinois Council, the district 

court is performing essentially appellate-style review 

of the agency's findings. That is, any -- the preferred 

course is that any additional factfindings that would be 

necessary would be made on remand and not taken by the 

district court. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not on the constitutional 

question. 

MR. FEIGIN: I think it would still be the 

preferred course that the agency would do any further 

factfinding that would be necessary in the first 

instance. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why? The district court 

is -- that's what it's equipped to do. That's what it 

does all the time. And --

MR. FEIGIN: Well, under 405(g), rather than 

1331, the preferred form of factfinding is in the agency 

and remands to the agency for further factfinding,

rather than development of the facts in the district 

court in the first instance. 

In any event, the Court has recognized that 

in Thunder Basin, for example, where review in the first 

instance was in the court of appeals, that the court of 

appeals had adequate authority to give meaningful 

judicial review to a constitutional claim that an 

agency, in that case the Mine Commission, by hypothesis 

could not decide.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY A. SCHWARTZ 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. SCHWARTZ: Thank you. We're not here 

for an exercise in which side can best rewrite the Civil 

Service Reform Act so that the Petitioners' claims can 

fit in it. What we're here for is to determine whether 

the background rule that Federal courts have Federal 

question jurisdiction, under the common law and under 

section 1331, to rule on claims challenging the 

constitutionality of an act of Congress. 

Now, the fall-back position is that that 

jurisdiction remains. What this Court is -- is tasked

to do is to see whether it's fairly discernible from the 

Civil Service Reform Act as it was written by Congress, 

not as it's twisted or amended or bent to fit these 

claims in it, but whether the Civil Service Reform Act 

as written by Congress revokes that background Federal 

court jurisdiction. 

And I suggest that the gyrations that have 

been discussed about, well, we could do this, we could 

go up, we could go down, we could do these odd 

procedures, show that it is not fairly discernible that 

Congress intended to somehow try to shoehorn these 

claims within the CSRA framework. And for that reason, 

not because the Government's system is better, not 

because the system that I'm proposing works better or is 

faster, but because there is no fairly discernible 

evidence from the Civil Service Reform Act, as written 

by Congress, that Congress intended to revoke this very 

fundamental jurisdiction of the district courts. 

This is a Marbury case, not a Bivens case. 

This is fundamental jurisdiction, the power of the 

Federal court to say that Congress, not some Federal 

agency, but that Congress acted in violation of the 

Constitution. And I suggest that it -- the Court should 

act carefully before deciding that Congress took that 

fundamental jurisdiction away from the district courts,
