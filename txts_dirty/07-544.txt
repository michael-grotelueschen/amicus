 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 07-544, Hedgpeth versus Pulido.

 Mr. Friedlander.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMY FRIEDLANDER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Respondent has agreed with us that the ninth 

circuit was wrong when it said that the error here and 

the one in Stromberg were structural defects.

 The remaining question is whether Respondent 

can salvage the Stromberg rule by making it part of a 

proper harmless error test as he attempted to do.

 His harmless error test is wrong for several 

reasons, but the Stromberg part of it was wrong for 

basically one reason. He makes the Stromberg rule into 

a rule of harmless error, and it is not even a correct 

rule of error.

 This Court has defined "instructional error" 

to require not merely a mistake in instruction, but a 

reasonable likelihood that the jury misapplied the law. 

So when Respondent says, invoking Stromberg, that to 

instruct the jury on valid and invalid theories is

harmless error if the jury adopted a valid theory, what 

Respondent is saying is nothing more than that no error 

occurred in the first place. Because the jury found 

everything it needed to find in order to convict and, 

therefore, did not misapply the law.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do that again, will you?

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: We need to have a 

reasonable likelihood that the jury misapplied the law. 

That's how we get to error. Respondent invokes 

Stromberg to say if the jury is instructed a right way 

and a wrong way and they went the right way, we have 

harmless error.

 No. What we really have is no error at all. 

Because there is the -- the jury did not misapply the 

law. Moreover, Stromberg is not even a correct rule of 

error. Because under Stromberg you have error if the 

jury could have misapplied the law. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I interrupt you? You 

are saying no error occurred, and on page 11 of your 

brief you say, "An unconstitutional instructional error 

occurred in this case because there was a reasonable 

likelihood the jury found," and so forth and so on.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: Yes. I agree that error 

occurred in this case. What I'm trying to argue here is 

that Respondent is entirely off base in importing the

Stromberg rule into a harmless error determination. 

Stromberg is, at most, a rule of error. The jury went 

the wrong way. That is a rule of error, but it is not 

even a correct rule of error because under Stromberg you 

say, could the jury have gone the wrong way; whereas, 

under this Court's modern precedent you have to have a 

reasonable likelihood that the jury --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you said that's what 

happened here. That's what your brief says.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: Yes. I agree that there 

was an error here but not because of Stromberg. Because 

this was a reasonable likelihood that the jury 

misapplied the law.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But you should have said 

"no" to the question, I think. Because I thought the 

question -- whatever it was, you are saying that there 

isn't a reasonable likelihood that its error influenced 

the outcome. You are not saying that?

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: There is a reasonable 

likelihood that the jury misapplied the law. That's the 

error question.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: Then the harmless error 

question is: Given that they misapplied the law, do we 

know under the requisite degree of certainty -- Chapman

on direct review, Brecht here -- that they would still 

have found him guilty of felony murder under a proper 

instruction?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you agree that the 

California Supreme Court gave an incorrect explanation 

to the answer to that question? They said there was no 

harmless error because the -- the jury made a specific 

finding that rebutted that, and that finding depended on 

the difference between the word "and" and "or."

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: I'm not sure I followed 

the last part of the question, but I agree with you if 

what you are saying is that the California Supreme 

Court, in effect, applied a Stromberg-like test. They 

said "necessarily resolved."

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. I'm -- I'm 

questioning the basis for the Supreme Court's conclusion 

that the error was harmless.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: Their basis for the 

conclusion was the jury's "special circumstance" 

finding.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: Now, they did not 

consider, when they made that "special" -- when they 

interpreted that "special circumstance," the "and/or" 

mistake that was embedded in the instructions.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Which meant that the jury 

really hadn't answered the question they thought it had 

answered.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: No, it didn't mean that. 

We don't agree with that. We don't believe that that is 

a correct interpretation of the instruction.

 But let me skip past that if you'll allow 

me. Even if you -- even if you accent any meaning from 

that "special circumstance" finding -- and we don't 

agree with that but even if you did -- you had at a 

minimum here the nature --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If you do that, you are 

removing the basis for the California Supreme Court's 

decision.

decision, yes, I think that's right.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: All right.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: Okay. But it doesn't 

matter because we are going to apply Brecht anyway.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Could you clarify the -- the 

category of cases that would be affected if your 

argument is accepted? There would be -- an error would 

be -- would not be harmless under Brecht if it had a 

substantial or -- or injurious effect, right?

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: True.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Now, what is the standard 

under California law for submitting a theory of 

liability to the jury? Presumably, you have to have 

some evidence in support of it.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: I'm not sure I understand 

the question. I think that goes to the question of 

whether there is error in the first place in submitting 

a factually unsupported theory.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, you are -- you are 

arguing that there are instances in which, when a theory 

of liability is submitted to the jury, the error -- and 

it's erroneous -- the error can be harmless.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Correct? Now, what are the

submitting the theory of liability to the jury in the 

first place? You have to have -- presumably, there has 

to be some evidence in support of that, right? How 

much?

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: I don't think -- I don't 

think I know the answer to that question. It would 

certainly be error under California State law if there 

is a reasonable -- if they have the same reasonable 

likelihood standard that the Federal courts have, if 

there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury 

misapplied the law.

 Now, in a -- but you seem to be focusing on 

an evidentiary sufficiency, and I think that's governed 

by Griffith where if you -- if you have an insufficient 

-- if you have insufficient evidence to support the 

theory, then it's inappropriate --

JUSTICE ALITO: What I'm asking is: When is 

there going to be a case in which a theory of liability 

is submitted to the jury and it's -- and it's erroneous 

-- multiple theories are submitted; one erroneous. And 

yet it would turn out that the submission of the 

erroneous theory did not have a substantial or injurious 

effect.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: This one -- this case --

this case was submitted to the jury on two alternative

theories: One of them correct, pre- killing aiding and 

abetting; one of them incorrect, post-killing aiding and 

abetting. And it didn't have a substantial injurious 

effect because we know that at an absolute minimum here 

the jury found that the defendant acted -- aided and 

abetted robbery with reckless indifference to human life 

and was a major participant in the robbery. And those 

findings were not compatible with post-killing aiding 

and abetting.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought there was --

that there was this -- there were three possibilities, 

and one was that the defendant didn't do anything 

before, didn't do anything during, but was simply an 

accessory after the fact.

 If the jury believed that, then there was no 

way it could convict him of the crime that he was 

convicted of.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: Well, the jury rejected 

accessory after the fact but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do we know that? Was 

there a special verdict?

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: They were instructed on 

accessory after the fact as the lesser offense and they 

found in essence robbery and felony murder.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They found the greater

offense, so there would have been no need for them to go 

to the lesser included offense. Your trouble is -- and 

I think the problem that we are having is that in 

finding the greater offense, they may have done so under 

a theory of accomplice liability that was consistent 

with the accomplice simply coming in at a late stage in 

the proceedings.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: Yes. That's right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, that's the 

difficulty we are having.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: Yes. There is a 

reasonable likelihood that in deciding felony murder 

they failed to decide that he engaged in the robbery 

before the killing.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: However, they went and 

found the special circumstance in which they found 

reckless, aiding and abetting with reckless indifference 

to human life and as a major participant.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I thought the, the 

difficulty with using that as a means of answering the 

first error was that the way the special circumstance 

instruction was phrased, they could have found the 

special circumstance without finding anything more than 

that he came in at a late stage.

MR. FRIEDLANDER: No. That's not correct. 

I don't believe that's correct.  It is true that part of 

the instruction, that and/or difficulty, focused on a 

different question, a different point, said that if you 

-- if they -- I'm blanking out but --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The second -- go ahead.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: It didn't address the 

reckless indifference to human life and the major 

participant, but that was embedded in the instructions, 

and from the start the courts that have looked at this 

and have reached this question have all agreed that 

there was a jury finding of reckless indifference to 

human life and major participant, and they have 

disagreed as to what it might have meant. Okay? Now, 

the U.S. district court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How do we -- in this --

how do we know what the jury found? They just came in 

with a guilty verdict; is that right?

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: No. They came in with a 

special circumstance finding. The special circumstance 

finding that this was --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't the special 

circumstance finding the one that had the word "or" in 

it, and therefore allowed the jury to give a post-

killing interpretation of the event.

MR. FRIEDLANDER: No. The special --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I thought that was what 

the California Supreme Court relied on?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree with Justice 

Stevens. I thought that was the whole problem, the "or" 

and the "and" is the problem for you.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: The -- I'll read from JA 

14. This is the special circumstance instruction that 

was -- was mistaken: "The murder was committed while 

the defendant was engaged in the commission or attempted 

commission of a robbery, or the murder was committed in 

order to carry out or advance the commission of the 

crime of robbery, et cetera."

 Now, that -- that finding alone we agree if 

you -- if you -- if you just follow that finding, that 

doesn't implicate the defendant. But you have to read 

at JA 13, the instruction, JA 13: "The defendant with 

reckless indifference to human life and as a major 

participant aided and abetted in the commission of a 

robbery which resulted in the death of Flores." That's 

at JA 13.

 So there were multiple findings here. And 

-- and the district court which -- this is at the bottom 

of the first paragraph of JA 13.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but isn't -- maybe I'm

not getting it. Help me out here. One possibility 

under -- under the instruction at JA 13 is "or assisted 

in the crime of robbery." And the other instructions 

because they are erroneous leave open the possibility of 

finding that he assisted in the crime of robbery only if 

he came in late. And that's why it does not solve the 

original error.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: No. The -- the problem 

with the, I think you're mixing up two things here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I may be doing that.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: The felony murder 

instructions did not speak to this question of 

contemporaneity. They left it open. That was error. 

We acknowledge that that was error. Okay? So they 

arguably find felony murder, aiding and abetting felony 

murder based on post- killing aiding and abetting. Now, 

the jury has to get to the special circumstance finding, 

right?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: And now it has to decide, 

among other things, as I -- as I read to you, "did he 

aid and abet robbery with reckless indifference to human 

life and as a major participant in the commission of a 

robbery which resulted in the death of Flores?" That's 

at JA 13. So what we --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Where does it say that he 

must have assisted prior to --

MR. FRIEDLANDER: It doesn't. It doesn't 

say that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then that doesn't cure the 

error.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: Yes, it does, and the 

reason that it does is because the harmless error test 

is not whether the jury actually made the finding that 

it needed to make; rather, the harmless error test is do 

we know from the evidence and from the findings that the 

jury would have made the findings that it was required 

to make had it been properly instructed?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me that 

you're arguing one of two things: First, that there was 

no error at all under Stromberg; or second, that if 

there was error, it was harmless error. And I thought 

the case was about whether or not the Ninth Circuit 

erred in concluding that harmless error analysis didn't 

apply to a Stromberg error.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: Yes. I'm not arguing the 

first point. I -- I concede there was error. I just 

wanted to make the point that Stromberg itself is an 

incorrect rule of error. But I can see that that's led 

us down a path that I didn't need to go down.

Now, we are certainly arguing harmless 

error. As for the Ninth Circuit's opinion, we said --

the Ninth Circuit said this is structural error. We 

don't even start a harmless error analysis.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The district court didn't 

say that.

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: No, it did not. And --

and we said that's wrong. This is trial error, not 

structural error.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if we were to say, 

Ninth Circuit, you were wrong, but the district court 

was right --

MR. FRIEDLANDER: Well, the district court 

was right to the extent that it found it to be trial 

error. It was wrong to the extent that it found it to 

be prejudicial trial error. But Respondent has agreed 

with us that this is not structural error, that we need 

to do a harmless error analysis, and what Respondent has 

done is import into this harmless error analysis we are 

saying the Stromberg rule; and it doesn't belong there.

 The Stromberg rule is not a proper rule of 

harmless error. It's at most a rule of error. I'd 

like --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But do you not agree that 

the harmless error -- the -- the rationale of the

analysis. Actually, I'm agreeing with you that there 

should have been harmless error. Did it perform the 

proper --

MR. FRIEDLANDER: It's incorrect in the way 

that you're thinking it is incorrect, but it was also 

incorrect in another way. It was incorrect in a way 

that it applied too strict a standard. It said has this 

question been necessarily been resolved; and it said 

yes, it has been necessarily resolved. Well, that's not 

the question. The harmless error question --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The -- answer was 

incorrect, too, wasn't it? And that answer was 

incorrect?

 MR. FRIEDLANDER: That answer was incorrect; 

and as well as what you're thinking, it was incorrect, 

in that they premised it on a factual basis that was not 

in fact the case. But I better reserve time for 

rebuttal.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I think the Chief Justice framed the main 

issue in this case properly. Consistent with the last 

two decades of this Court's instructional error 

jurisprudence, the Court should hold that the type of 

error at issue is not structural and is subject to 

harmless error review.

 The Ninth Circuit's contrary interpretation 

of Stromberg creates the untenable result that adding an 

invalid theory -- adding a valid theory to an invalid 

one somehow makes the error worse. Even Respondent now 

rejects that interpretation. It follows that this Court 

should reverse the Ninth Circuit and remand for 

application of harmless error review under Brecht.

 The main issue --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's what the district 

judge did, right?

 MR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor. The district 

court did apply harmless error review under Brecht. The 

court of appeals, of course, did not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It could just review the

district court's decision using the standards that the 

district court used?

 MR. SHAH: This Court could do that, but the 

longstanding and customary practice of this Court is 

that when the court of appeals does not address the 

harmless error question, that it remands to that court. 

It did that in Rose V. Clark, in Pope V. Illinois and 

California V. Roy, and more recently in Recuenco.

 And in several of those cases the 

intermediate court or the district court, in the habeas 

context, did address it and the court of appeals didn't 

in all of those cases that the Court did remand for 

application of harmless error.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I wasn't questioning 

that. The issue, is the United States position say 

structural error was wrong, harmless error was right, 

and then just have the Ninth Circuit review the district 

court's decision that held that there was harmless error 

the way it would ordinarily review a district court 

decision?

 MR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor, but I would add 

that this Court should also clarify the scope of that 

harmless error inquiry. I think there are two important 

principles. There is no logical reason to apply a 

narrower form of harmless error review in this case than

the Court did in Neder.

 So I think that this Court should clarify 

that the principles of harmlessness articulated in Neder 

should apply on remand to the Ninth Circuit. I think 

those of those principles bear mention.

 First, the question is not what the jury 

actually or necessarily found, but rather, it 

encompasses what a rationale jury would have found 

absent the error.

 And I think the second important point for 

this Court to clarify is that harmlessness review is not 

limited to cases, is not limited to cases where the 

relevant elements are undisputed, but rather even when 

disputed, a reviewing court should consider the entire 

record and determine whether, in light of the jury 

finding, there is sufficient evidence to support a 

contrary verdict. And then it should remand, Your 

Honor, to the court of appeals to apply those 

principles.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say in light of 

the jury finding when you have disavowed any necessity 

that the jury had found this?

 MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, we do --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean "in light of the 

jury finding," why don't you just drop that.

MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, we think it's 

important because there are certain jury findings that 

we know the jury made in this case. The jury returned a 

special circumstance verdict. And we know based upon 

that verdict that at a minimum, the jury found that 

Respondent was a major participant in the crime -- just 

taking the facts of this case, the Respondent was a 

major participant in the robbery, that he exhibited a 

reckless disregard for human life.

 And we also know that the jury rejected a 

duress defense. The jury was instructed on that 

defense, and yet the jury came back guilty.

 So I don't think that the -- that the 

inquiry should take place in a vacuum, but, of course, 

the reviewing court should have the benefit of the 

limited jury findings that we do know were made, and 

then apply the sufficiency inquiry in light of those 

jury findings. There is no reason to disregard the jury 

findings that were made.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Suppose it's not, in 

the abstract anyway, necessarily true that this case 

follows a fortiori, because here, at least you have a 

valid theory. That may make it a harder case, because 

the jury had based its entire verdict on an invalid 

theory.

It may be more difficult than a situation 

where you've got a theory of the case that is invalid 

because a particular element is missing. And you can 

look and see whether or not that was harmless or not.

 MR. SHAH: I would disagree, Mr. Chief 

Justice. I think there are two possibilities in a case 

with alternative theories. One possibility is that the 

jury relies upon the defective instruction. For 

example, there is one element omitted just like the 

instruction in Neder. If that's what the jury had done, 

then this case is no different than Neder, no better, no 

worse, right.

 The other possibility, however, is that the 

jury relies on the completely valid theory. If the jury 

relied on the completely valid theory, then there is 

even less of a problem than Neder. There is no problem 

at all.

 So I don't see how the error in this 

alternative valid theory and defense theory circumstance 

could be any --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The difference is when you 

only got one theory, you know what he relied on. When 

you got alternatives, how do you know which one he 

relied on?

 MR. SHAH: Well, you don't -- you don't,

Your Honor. And that's what the reviewing court has to 

decide. But in either scenario, if it -- if you assume 

that the jury relied on the defective theory, then we 

are in the same box as in Neder, and the reviewing court 

would decide whether there was -- you know, they would 

apply the harmless error review to the missing element 

and decide whether there was sufficient evidence to 

render that error harmless; or the court could ask, 

well, is that uncontraverted or overwhelming evidence 

that the defendant would have been found guilty under 

the valid theory.

 And that would also be a permissible 

inquiry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess, 

though, the point is when you have invalid and valid 

theories, it would be a little harder than Neder, 

because they don't have to make any findings under the 

valid theory. You know, because you don't just have to 

fill in a missing piece of the puzzle, as in Neder. You 

have to -- they might have been working on an entirely 

different puzzle.

 MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, in almost all 

conceivable cases there is going to be at least some 

overlap between -- between the two theories. And what 

the -- the reason why that's relevant is because you

know that when the jury has returned a general verdict 

of guilt, they have necessarily found beyond a 

reasonable doubt that each of those elements has been 

satisfied.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No. But in this case the 

question is whether the uncle did it or the nephew did 

it. And if there is a lot of doubt about -- about -- if 

there is substantial reason to believe maybe it was the 

uncle, they might have taken the easy case out. I think 

this is vastly different from a single theory case.

 MR. SHAH: Well, Your honor, here's why --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Because it's an -- there 

is plenty of evidence that he might have been guilty 

after the fact. There is no doubt about that. But 

there is doubt about the former.

 MR. SHAH: Your Honor, here's why I think 

the cases aren't that different, because, you know, at a 

minimum from the general verdict of guilt if you take a 

case like this, you know that the jury found that there 

was an unlawful killing. You know that the jury found 

that there was a robbery. You know that the jury found 

that Respondent was involved in the robbery. The only 

element that we don't know --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Perhaps after -- after the 

death occurred. That's all we really know.

MR. SHAH: It is possible that the jury 

would have found that, and that's the question that the 

reviewing court would perform in harmless error review, 

just like if there -- basically that is the exact same 

question the Court would form, would do under Neder if 

the timing element were omitted all together. The 

reviewing court would look at the evidence and decide is 

there sufficient evidence to support an after-the-fact 

participation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So what we are 

talking about, in other words, is the application of 

harmless error, which may or may not be harder in the 

multiple theory case, and not the question of whether 

harmless error analysis should be applied.

 MR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor. That's going to 

be completely fact dependent whether it's harder or not. 

But I think analytically it's exactly the same as in 

Neder.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Aren't there going to be 

cases in which there's enough evidence to support the 

submission of a theory of liability to the jury, but so 

little that the court is going to be able to say that 

it's harmless under -- that the submission of the 

invalid theory was harmless under Brecht?

 MR. SHAH: Yes. I mean, you can image in a

case -- take Neder. By this Neder instruction, the one 

omitting the materiality element, was submitted to the 

jury certainly enough evidence to support it, and then 

there was another valid theory --

JUSTICE ALITO: There is difference. An 

element of the defense has to be submitted to the jury. 

And it may be that that it's -- the element is 

undisputed, but a theory of liability isn't going to be 

submitted to the jury unless there is some evidence to 

support it.

 MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, if -- if there 

is some evidence to support it, if we were in a direct 

review context, that's the inquiry that Neder says. So 

on a clean slate it might be that if there is sufficient 

evidence to support a contrary verdict, that that would 

end the inquiry.

 But in many of these cases we are going to 

know that the jury has made at least some findings, has 

found some of the elements. And that might inform the 

harmless error inquiry, just like in this as we know 

that the jury has found things like a respondent was a 

major participant, exhibited a reckless disregard for 

human life, discounted a significant portion of this --

of his statement by rejecting the duress defense.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. BRADLEY O'CONNELL

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. O'CONNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Unlike the Sarausad case argued earlier this 

morning, this is a case of conceded constitutional error 

under the reasonable likelihood standard, the same 

question that consumed so much of the Sarausad argument.

 We acknowledge that this is a trial error 

and is subject to the Brecht prejudice standard. And as 

I believe Justice Souter commented during the Sarausad 

argument, in a Brecht situation, the defendant wins the 

benefit of the doubt. That is a lesson of this Court's 

decision.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with that. And my 

question is going to be -- at some point, both of you 

seem to agree with that so -- pretty much, it's a 

harmless error standard of review. I think a wrote a 

case on that, which says that --

MR. O'CONNELL: Yes. You wrote on O'Neal, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. So why don't we

just send it back and say apply the standard?

 MR. O'CONNELL: Your Honor, although the 

Ninth Circuit admittedly used a structural defect 

nomenclature with which we don't agree, we believe that 

the Court can't -- that upon considering both the Ninth 

Circuit decision and the district court decision, this 

Court can affirm because the inquiry which the Ninth 

Circuit did conduct was actually a case-specific 

inquiry, not really a structural defect inquiry, and 

when an examination of the evidence and the verdicts and 

the instructions and anything else indicative of the 

jury's thinking still leaves the court uncertain whether 

the jurors relied on the valid or the invalid theory, 

that's a substantial and injurious influence. That is 

grave doubt. That is equipoise, in the language of Your 

Honor's opinion.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying that I should 

have grave doubt myself and any judge would have to. He 

made an argument here I think that wasn't such a bad 

one. He said look at page 14 and you'll see the 

mistake, you know, in the joint appendix.

 MR. O'CONNELL: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: There it is. And it's 

absolutely wrong. The basic instruction under the law 

says you have to be engaged in the crime and you have to

have a certain state of intent. You have to have 

committed this murder in order to help the crime or at 

least in order to escape.

 MR. O'CONNELL: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And that's wrong. Put them 

together, but then look at the instruction on page 13, 

which he actually gave, and the one on 13 really does 

seem to say that, or more so. It says, you can only 

apply -- jury, you can only apply this special 

instruction if two things are true: First, in lines 9 

through 12 of that instruction, it seems to repeat that 

you have to be engaged in the crime. And then just 

before that, it says, and you have to have one of two 

states of mind. You have to either intend to kill the 

person or at least be recklessly indifferent. And since 

that's what we said on page 13, the fact we made a 

mistake on page 14 doesn't matter that much. That's one 

of his arguments that I'm sure they have a lot of 

evidentiary ones and a bunch of other ones.

 MR. O'CONNELL: Your Honor, I think the 

answer to that question is in the underlying trial 

reporter's transcript at pages 1015 to 1016, the 

district attorney's cross-examination of Mr. Pulido. 

The district attorney developed the theme quite 

effectively that, even under Mr. Pulido's own account,

he exhibited reckless indifference because he saw the 

mortally wounded victim lying there, and the D.A. said, 

did you try to resuscitate him? Have you ever had a CPR 

class? I did once. Well, did you do CPR on him? No. 

Did you call 9-11? You didn't care whether he lived or 

died, did you?

 So this entire line of cross-examination, to 

which the district attorney came back again, though 

somewhat less dramatically, at 1330 of the transcript 

and again at 1337 to 1338, commenting that he -- that 

Mr. Pulido did not go back in at some later point to 

check on the victim's condition, that entire line of 

cross-examination encouraged the theme that even under 

Mr. Pulido's own account of the facts, he showed 

reckless indifference. And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the error wasn't 

harmless. And that's an argument you can make before 

the Ninth Circuit on remand.

 MR. O'CONNELL: That certainly is an 

argument that if the Court -- if the Court is convinced 

that the Ninth Circuit's analysis in substance --

because I realize the nomenclature -- the nomenclature 

was inconsistent with harmless error, and I'm not going 

to defend that. If the Court is convinced that the 

substance of the Ninth Circuit's analysis was so far

removed from what harmless error analysis requires in 

this context, we agree that the usual course would be to 

send it back.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why don't we 

just take them at their word? As you say, they are 

applying the wrong nomenclature. It would be easy 

enough for them when they get it back to say, oh, we 

meant, you know, harmless error under Brecht. But that 

seems to me to be at least an open question.

 MR. O'CONNELL: Your Honor, I think I could 

best answer that by offering my own critique of the 

Ninth Circuit opinion and -- which may explain why it 

may be unnecessary. In my opinion, what the analysis 

that the Ninth Circuit conducted was equivalent to a 

sufficient analysis, equivalent to the point of 

equipoise discussed in O'Neal. That is to say, it 

reviewed the evidence and said -- and the verdicts and 

the instructions -- and said we're uncertain, we can't 

tell which way the jury went.

 My critique of the Ninth Circuit's -- at 

least its per curiam opinion, as opposed to one of the 

concurring opinions, is that in fact this is not just a 

general verdict case. We know a great deal about the 

jurors' thinking in this case. We know that by a vote 

of either 8-4 or 4-8, the jurors rejected the

prosecution's primary theory, which was that Pulido 

personally shot the victim and that, in the prosecutor's 

words, Aragon had nothing to do with this, Aragon wasn't 

there, Aragon isn't a murderer.

 We also know -- and this will be another 

echo of the Sarausad case -- we also know that 

throughout their five days of deliberations, the jurors 

submitted question after question directed to what are 

now -- what are concededly defective erroneous 

instructions, and moreover, those questions focused 

right in on the defect in the instructions and in 

particular the timing of Mr. Pulido's assistance.

 And I refer the Court in particular to the 

jurors' handwritten diagrams of alternative conceptions 

of felony-murder aiding and abetting liability, which 

are at 36 to 38 of the joint appendix, and also the 

jurors' question at page 41 of the joint appendix 

whether -- this goes right -- this goes, as the district 

court said, to the crux of the issue: Does the 

defendant have to have knowledge before or during the 

crime of the -- of the unlawful purpose of the 

perpetrator? And as to both of those questions the 

judge said: Go back and reread those same instructions, 

which of course were erroneous.

 So my critique of the Ninth Circuit opinion,

which is again slightly different, I think, than the 

State's, would be that it neglected to mention that 

compelling evidence that in fact the jurors actually 

found a set of facts corresponding to the invalid late 

joiner theory, because in my view what -- the analysis 

the Ninth Circuit conducted gets us to a point of 

equipoise, and that's enough for Brecht. The defect in 

the Ninth Circuit's analysis is they neglected to also 

factor in those juror queries, and in my view the juror 

queries move us from a state of equipoise to a very high 

probability that the jurors relied on the -- and adopted 

a factual scenario corresponding to an invalid theory.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under Brecht, you 

have the burden of showing a substantial injurious 

effect.

 MR. O'CONNELL: Well, actually, Your Honor, 

as understand O'Neal the Court specifically renounced 

describing it as a burden, and in fact said that we are 

not going to use the "burden" terminology, and rather 

than talk about allocating burdens, we are going to 

address it from the perspective of the judge and say, if 

the judge is in equipoise, that is sufficient.

 We also know that -- drawing upon the 

relationship between the Brecht standard and others, we 

know that a Strickland standard is deemed to -- that if

you have Strickland prejudice, you don't have to go 

through a separate Brecht analysis. Because of 

Strickland, reasonable probability also satisfies 

Brecht's substantial and injurious influence. Well, 

this Court has said again and again, in construing 

Strickland, it does not require a more likely than not 

showing; it simply requires a showing sufficient to 

undermine confidence in the outcome. And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think you win 

under Brecht?

 MR. O'CONNELL: I think we will under 

Brecht, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You think the Ninth 

Circuit, although it didn't use that label, actually 

applied the Brecht standard?

 MR. O'CONNELL: In substance, it did even 

though, as I said, I will -- I can't -- I can't run from 

the language the Ninth Circuit actually used.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure. Well, then it 

seems to me you agree with your friend that the Brecht 

standard -- and the government -- that the Brecht 

standard applies.

 MR. O'CONNELL: Yes, we do, Your Honor.

over is whether the Ninth Circuit applied that standard

applied it in substance.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why don't we just 

send it back and ask them? Say: We can't tell. The 

parties are having disagreement about what you did. 

What did you do?

 MR. O'CONNELL: Your Honor, as I said a 

little earlier, if I fail to persuade the Court that the 

substance of what the Ninth Circuit did was --

effectively satisfied Brecht as interpreted in O'Neal, 

then I agree that's an appropriate course, and we 

indicated that in the final section of our brief. There 

is not --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm sure that would be -- I 

mean, what worries me is proliferating arguments among 

judges. Why not just say, you know, apply Brecht. I'd 

like it with the O'Neal clause because it seems to me 

the O'Neal clause applies.

 MR. O'CONNELL: I agree, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Just go do it. And then 

they can say "we already did it," or they can say "we 

didn't already do it, but we'll do it now." Let them

don't -- I don't strenuously object to that because, as 

I've mentioned if the court, if the court remains, 

remains of the view that what the Ninth Circuit did was 

simply incompatible with Brecht, then I agree it should 

be sent back and I -- and I understand why that might be 

the Court's inclination. Let me offer another angle for 

why what the Ninth Circuit did is entirely compatible 

with Brecht.

 In civil cases, this Court routinely applies 

the same sort of general verdict analysis which in 

criminal cases has become to be known as the Stromberg 

line. In fact, it did it as recently this summer in the 

Exxon Valdez case. Now civil cases don't have Chapman, 

they don't have structural defect; civil cases are 

subject to a harmless error standard which ultimately 

goes back to the identical statute which was construed 

in Kotteakos.

 And going back to the opinion of the Court 

in O'Neal, in addressing the relationship between 

Kotteakos/Brecht harmless error review and civil 

harmless error review, the Court indicated he think 

rather strongly that those standards are either 

equivalent or to the extent that they differ, the 

Brecht/ Kotteakos standard is less forgiving of error 

because of the liberty interest at stake. Now that

means two things. From a retrospective point of view of 

simply construing this Court's different lines of cases, 

I think it demonstrates that this general verdict 

analysis is entirely consistent with a Kotteakos type 

harmless error analysis, but it also has some 

perspective implications, because if this Court were to 

wholly disavow that type of analysis and say that has 

nothing to do with harmless error review, that's going 

to impact civil cases, too; and obviously in all this 

Court's opinions, the Court is considering not only the 

immediate case, but what is going to happen if we -- if 

we rule one way or another.

 So this case -- this case supports a finding 

of prejudice under that O'Neal equipoise and as for the 

Ninth Circuit did, that's not what it called it, it even 

more strongly supports prejudice when one factors in the 

rest of the record, notably the juror -- the juror 

queries and another item which I think may be responsive 

to some of Justice Alito's earlier questions, which is 

the strength of the evidence on the various theories.

 There were three theories and obviously 

there was evidence in support of the prosecution's main 

theory that Pulido shot the victim himself. There was 

evidence -- obviously there was substantial evidence in 

the form of Pulido's own testimony in support of the

invalid late-joiner theory. Out of these the one theory 

that had least support in the record before the jury was 

the valid aiding and abetting theory, because no witness 

testified to a scenario in which Pulido assisted in some 

fashion or another prior to the shooting; nor did the 

prosecutor attempt to develop that type of scenario in 

argument because the prosecutor was very clear: 

Prosecutor said you're going to get aiding and abetting 

instructions just in case. They only apply -- if --

they only come into play if you were to believe the 

defendant's story which was a real whopper; but if you 

believe the defendant's story the felony murder rule 

applies.

 But then the prosecutor immediately went 

back, "but I don't think it applies at all, Aragon 

wasn't there. Aragon didn't do it. Pulido did it," and 

prosecutor went back to his primary theory.

 So the theory which the -- present in the 

instructions was least before the jury, was the valid 

aiding and abetting theory, yet defining this conceded 

error harmless depends on the notion either that the 

jury actually adopted a pre-shooting aiding or abetting 

or that they necessarily would have adopted one if 

properly instructed.

 There is one final point I'd like to make,

which is there is a qualitative aspect to Brecht; and 

when one has an error under which the defense testimony 

even if believed renders the defendant guilty 

erroneously, that derails the entire defense. That it 

seems to me is the quintessential substantial and 

injurious influence; because it practically renders the 

trial nullity by erroneously telling the jury even if 

you find this set of facts, the defendant is guilty.

 So for these reasons and additionally for 

the very thorough prejudice analysis found in the 

district court opinion, we urge the Court to affirm, 

despite the Ninth Circuit's inept nomenclature, but in 

the event the Court is dissatisfied with that 

explanation, we have acknowledged that the appropriate 

course in that instance would be to send it back under 

Brecht.

 Unless the Court has any further questions, 

I'm prepared to submit.

Mr. O'Connell.

MR. FRIEDLANDER: We agree that we need to 

do Brecht. We disagree on what Brecht is. Respondent 

is telling you that Brecht is the error test, whether 

the jury relied on the valid or invalid theory. That's 

what he says Brecht is. In Calderon v Coleman, this 

Court said there is a difference between the error test 

and the harmless error test.

 All these questions that the jury asked went 

to the question of error. Did the jury misapply the law 

by failing to find a contemporaneity aspect of felony 

murder? They did not go to the harmless error question 

of what the jury would have done had it been properly 

instructed.

 We urge the Court in remanding the case to 

make clear that the error analysis must be kept separate 

from the harmless error analysis. This is a mistake 

Judge Thomas made in his concurring opinion. We -- he 

assumes -- he sees a mistake in an instruction; he 

assumes that the mistake rises to the level of 

constitutional error; and then he does a prejudice 

analysis by deciding whether the mistake caused the jury 

to misapply the law. In other words, he -- he applies 

an error analysis to decide prejudice. And what he does 

is he includes all this evidence of the questions the 

jury asked when those questions went only to the

misapplication of law that was the error, and did 

nothing to show the basis of the jury's special 

circumstance finding, which is the heart of the harmless 

error determination here. If there are no further 

questions.
