3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

4 argument first today in Case 07-330, Greenlaw versus 

United States.
 

6  Ms. Howe.
 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY HOWE
 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 

9  MS. HOWE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
 

please the Court: 

11  For over 200 years, this Court has held, 

12 without exception, that an appellate court may not 

13 modify a judgment in a party's favor unless that party 

14 has filed a notice of appeal. Such a rule, this Court 

has explained, serves important interests in notice and 

16 finality. 

17  In 1984, Congress enacted the Sentencing 

18 Reform Act against the backdrop of this well settled 

19 rule. In 18 U.S.C. section 3742, Congress provided for 

limited appellate review of sentencing errors. Nothing 

21 in the text, structure, or history of section 3742 

22 reflects any intent by Congress to deviate from the 

23 inveterate and certain cross-appeal rule, nor is there 

24 any reason why sentencing appeals should be treated any 

differently from other appeals. Instead, section 3742

1 reflects traditional principles of appellate
 

2 jurisdiction. In --

3  JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you this
 

4 question? I've been thinking about this case.
 

Supposing your client prevailed on appeal and they held 

6 a resentencing.  Could the district judge have increased 

7 the sentence? 

8  MS. HOWE: No. It could not have because 

9 the government --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The district judge could 

11 not have increased it? If they sent it back for a new 

12 sentencing, a fresh hearing on what the sentencing 

13 should be, would the district judge have been foreclosed 

14 from giving a higher sentence than he gave the first 

time? 

16  MS. HOWE: If -- he would have been 

17 foreclosed, yes, Your Honor. 

18  JUSTICE STEVENS: What's the authority for 

19 that proposition?

 MS. HOWE: Simply that the -- the district 

21 --

22  JUSTICE STEVENS: Say, if it was a capital 

23 case and he won on appeal, he could get the death 

24 sentence the second time around, which is a little more 

serious sentence.

1  Why couldn't he have gotten a higher 

2 sentence. 

3  MS. HOWE: This is a -- the case actually in 

4 United States versus Harvey, which was a case out of the 

Third Circuit, and, although the district court could 

6 order the same sentence, it can't increase the sentence. 

7 Yes. It would be circumventing the cross-appeal rule. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that based on any --

9 any precedent of this Court's?

 MS. HOWE: No. It's based on the 

11 cross-appeal rule. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So just on the 

13 cross-appeal rule? 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought 

it would depend on what the mandate from the court of 

16 appeals said. If the mandate said the sentence is 

17 vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing, it 

18 seems to me that leaves open the full range of 

19 legitimate sentencing.

 MS. HOWE: Certainly. I mean, our argument 

21 would be that the -- you know, if the court of appeals 

22 can't order the sentence increased, that on remand the 

23 district court couldn't circumvent the cross-appeal rule 

24 by increasing the sentence as well.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the court 

5

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 of appeals -- if your argument is correct, the court of 

2 appeals is limited solely by virtue of the failure to 

3 file a notice of cross-appeal. That -- that's a 

4 limitation that wouldn't apply in the district court.

 MS. HOWE: No, that's certainly true, that 

6 it would be circumventing the cross-appeal rule to allow 

7 the district court to do something that --

8  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it would also, I take 

9 it, be circumventing what could happen in the district 

court. You have to move very -- seven days in the 

11 district court for mathematical error, and that's it. 

12  MS. HOWE: Yes, under this rule. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than for assistance 

14 --

MS. HOWE: Yes, the district court has, I 

16 believe, seven days to correct the sentence. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: This would not be a 

18 mathematical error? 

19  MS. HOWE: No. This would not be a 

mathematical error, but --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: I could have sworn that 

22 I've seen more than one petition for certiorari in which 

23 the claim is that the sentence was increased on remand 

24 vindictively. I'm sure I've seen cert petitions like 

that. And you're telling me that the assertion of 

6
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 vindictiveness is unnecessary, and it just can't be 

2 increased on remand? 

3  But all you have is a court of appeals case 

4 for that.

 MS. HOWE: Yes, we --

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Perhaps that's after a new 

7 trial. 

8  MS. HOWE: Perhaps. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What happens if it's --

what happens if the sentence is five years, reversed on 

11 appeal, error in evidence, same -- same offense, same 

12 indictment? Then you have to comply with the 

13 vindictiveness rules before he can give a higher 

14 sentence?

 MS. HOWE: I think it might be different if 

16 it were -- if there were a new trial on the same 

17 indictment. But -- you know, going back to the 

18 cross-appeal rule, I mean, the court of appeals could --

19 the district court could certainly impose the same 

sentence. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you think is the 

22 rule if there's a new trial and the judge says, you 

23 know, what about this, I heard the evidence again; I 

24 think I'm going to increase the sentence?

 MS. HOWE: Well, our argument would be that

1 the government had forfeited the right to make that 

2 argument and that the district court would not be -- you 

3 know, that would essentially be sua sponte ordering --

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what's sua sponte --

MS. HOWE: You know, if the government had 

6  --

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a resentence. 

8 There's a new judgment, a new conviction. What happens 

9 then?

 MS. HOWE: New judgment and conviction -- it 

11 -- the rule may be different. Unless double jeopardy 

12 may apply as well. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Double jeopardy if it's a 

14 new judge? Is that what you said?

 MS. HOWE: I -- I'm not sure. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Who asked this question? 

17 We're going to get a totally different case here. 

18  (Laughter.) 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Let's go back to where 

you started, and that was with the statute, 37 -- what 

21 is it? 42? 

22  MS. HOWE: 42. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- (f). And the -- that 

24 has two subparts, and the first part just says the court 

of appeals can decide whether a sentence was imposed in 

8
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 violation of law, period. 

2  And (2) has two subparts that refer to the 

3 party appealing. So why doesn't the first one cover 

4 both sides when the second one is distinctly divided 

into (a) and (b) parts? 

6  MS. HOWE: Certainly, Justice Ginsburg. And 

7 that -- this is reprinted on page 5a of the government's 

8 brief. And the inference that I think, 

9 Justice Ginsburg, you're drawing and that the amicus 

would have you draw is that the fact that the subsection 

11 (f)(2), which is on page 6a, subsection (f)(2)(A) and 

12 (b) refer to whether the appeal has been filed; whereas, 

13 subsection (f)(1) says not, which means that, in some 

14 circumstances, the cross-appeal rule does not apply in 

circumstances such as that. 

16  But our interpretation, which we think is 

17 the correct one, is that the only reason that subsection 

18 (f)(1) does not refer to whether an appeal has been 

19 filed is that subsection (f)(1) refers to the kind of 

claims that both defendants and the government can 

21 bring; whereas, subsection (f)(2) parallels 

22 subsections(a)(3) and (b)(3), but (c), only the 

23 defendant can appeal an upward departure; only the 

24 government can appeal a downward departure.

 And our interpretation, again, which we 

9
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 think is the correct one, is that subsection (f)(1)
 

2 doesn't need to refer to whether an appeal has been
 

3 filed, because -- because both the defendant and the
 

4 government can bring those kinds of appeals.


 And even if you don't agree with that
 

6 interpretation, I think it's worth noting that the
 

7 amicus -- that the amicus's construction is further
 

8 flawed for three reasons. And the first is that that
 

9 would cause subsection (f)(2) to operate illogically.
 

There's no reason why the -- for example, if you had a 

11 case in which the defendant had appealed and the 

12 government had not appealed, under this interpretation 

13 the court of appeals could increase a sentence if it 

14 found there had been a misapplication of the Guidelines 

that would result in an increase in the defendant's 

16 sentence; but the court of appeals would not be allowed 

17 to increase the defendant's sentence if it found that 

18 there was an unwarranted downward departure, because the 

19 government had filed a notice of appeal. We don't think 

-- that doesn't make any sense. We don't think there's 

21 any reason why Congress would have intended for it to 

22 operate this way. 

23  The second reason is that this is a very 

24 thin reed to rest this construction of the statute on, 

given that Congress must have been aware of the 

10
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 cross-appeal rule. There's no reason to think that it 

2 would have departed from two centuries of appellate 

3 practice in this way, based on this -- this very thin 

4 reed, and in fact we know from the Organized Crime 

Control Act of 1970 that Congress was aware of the 

6 cross-appeal rule because in that case it expressly 

7 carved out that exception --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: What happens if it's just 

9 the converse case? The same thing, I take it.

 MS. HOWE: I'm sorry? 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: We have a government 

12 appeal. The sentence was 10 years. The government 

13 thinks it should be 20. 

14  On appeal, the appellate court thinks the 

government is wrong, and moreover, the appellate court 

16 discovers an error: It should have been one year. And 

17 you're saying, well, according to you, not only is the 

18 court of appeals helpless, but the district court is 

19 helpless. So this person is in jail for nine years 

where he shouldn't have been. That's your position 

21 here? 

22  MS. HOWE: That's correct, Justice Breyer. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's a pretty tough 

24 position. It -- it seems to me there could be errors --

and I guess if he's sentenced to death, it's the same. 

11

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 I mean, the -- the -- it's a pretty tough position, 

2 isn't it? That there is no authority in the courts of 

3 appeals, or in the district court, or anywhere in the 

4 system to create -- to correct a serious error where a 

person could, in fact, be in prison for a long time 

6 contrary to the law. 

7  MS. HOWE: Well --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: How is it supposed to work 

9 in your system that we get those errors corrected?

 MS. HOWE: I have three points, 

11 Justice Breyer. 

12  The first is that Congress must have been 

13 aware of this scenario in particular because in the 

14 Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, when the government 

appeals, that -- in those provisions, that brought up 

16 the defendant's sentence and his conviction for review. 

17 And Congress decided, for whatever reason, not to 

18 continue that -- that exception to the cross-appeal rule 

19 when it enacted the Sentencing Reform Act.

 The second point, Justice Breyer, is that 

21 we're not aware that there's actually any body of case 

22 law in which this happened. No one has pointed to any 

23 cases in which this has actually happened. The --

24  JUSTICE STEVENS: I believe you say it has 

decided not to make an exception to the cross-appeal 

12
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 rule. Of course, the cross-appeal rule itself is not 

2 statutory, is it? 

3  MS. HOWE: The cross-appeal rule itself is 

4 not statutory, but --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It's an arguable rule 

6 among the courts of appeal as to whether there is such a 

7 rule. 

8  MS. HOWE: It is indeed, Justice Stevens, 

9 but --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So it's not surprising 

11 that Congress didn't make exception to a rule that isn't 

12 that firmly established. 

13  MS. HOWE: It is not surprising, but we know 

14 from the Organized Crime Control Act that Congress 

certainly was aware of the cross-appeal rule, because in 

16 that case it did carve out a limited exception. 

17  And my third point, Justice Breyer, 

18 returning to your question, is that the defendant in 

19 that case may well have an argument, may be able to seek 

post-conviction relief under section 2255, as the 

21 Government acknowledges in its brief. 

22  So he may be able to go back to the district 

23 court under section 2255 and obtain relief in that 

24 manner.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought it was sort of an 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 important part of your case that the cross-appeal rule 

2 was an established rule. You now knowledge that it's 

3 not an established rule? 

4  MS. HOWE: Well, we do believe it is 

jurisdictional, Justice Scalia. In the Morley case, 

6 which we think --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: Not just jurisdictional but 

8 well-established. 

9  MS. HOWE: We believe it is both 

well-established and jurisdictional. And we believe, in 

11 particular, when you're talking about sentencing, even 

12 if you don't agree with us that the cross-appeal rule 

13 generally is jurisdiction, we believe that section 3742 

14 is jurisdictional. Because it sets out in subsections A 

and B, the kinds of errors that defendants and the 

16 government can bring. 

17  But we also believe that it ultimately 

18 doesn't matter in this case, Justice Scalia, because 

19 even if, as amicus concedes, it is merely a rule of 

practice, it is a rule of practice that is not subject 

21 to exception, and Mr. Greenlaw timely invoked it at his 

22 earliest opportunity. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: But you say it is a 

24 well-established at least rule of practice.

 MS. HOWE: Absolutely.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: And what's to be said 

2 against that? How many courts of appeals do not apply 

3 that? 

4  MS. HOWE: The Eighth Circuit in this case 

certainly does not apply it. The Tenth Circuit --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they --

7  MS. HOWE: They acknowledge. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: They didn't apply it under 

9 this statute. I am saying, apart from this statute, 

what courts of appeals in other cases deny the existence 

11 of a cross-appeal rule? 

12  MS. HOWE: The District of Columbia Circuit 

13 and the Ninth Circuit both regard it is a rule of 

14 practice that may be subject to exceptions and 

exceptional circumstances. But, even if it is a rule of 

16 practice, Justice Scalia, we still prevail because 

17 Mr. Greenlaw has timely invoked it at his earliest 

18 opportunity and because in a sentencing context it is 

19 not subject to any exception.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What difference does it 

21 make? Now, you said this is a jurisdictional rule 

22 because its no rule. What difference does it make if it 

23 is labeled "jurisdictional," or if it is just regarded 

24 as a tight procedural requirement?

 MS. HOWE: It makes a difference,

1 Justice Ginsburg, in the sense that it cannot be waived 

2 if it is jurisdictional. The Court can raise it at any 

3 time. If it is a rule of practice, it is subject to 

4 exception below. In this -- as in this case with this 

rule, the Court has not found an exception in over 200 

6 years. The -- in the sentencing context in particular, 

7 it is not subject to exception. 

8  And Mr. Greenlaw timely invoked it. If this 

9 Court has no further questions, I'd like to reserve the 

remainder of my time.

13  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD 

14  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. MAYNARD: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

16 please the Court: 

17  The Court of Appeals erred in increasing 

18 Petitioner's sentence for two reasons: 

19  First, it lacked jurisdiction to do so in 

the absence of a notice of appeal by the Government 

21 under 18 USC 3742(b). 

22  Second, even assuming it did not strictly 

23 lack jurisdiction, it nevertheless violated the 

24 mandatory claim- processing rule that a judgment may not 

be increased in favor of an appellee in the absence of a

1 timely --

2  JUSTICE ALITO: Now, if the cross-appeal 

3 rule is jurisdictional, how do you account for the 

4 sentencing-package cases? The court makes a mistake on 

count 1, and the district court makes a mistake on count 

6 1, the court of appeals vacates the entire sentence for 

7 the development of a new sentencing package. 

8  MS. MAYNARD: Those cases are not 

9 inconsistent with the finding of jurisdictional, Justice 

Alito, because in those cases the court of appeals has 

11 granted the defendant's requested relief, and it has 

12 vacated the judgment at the request of the defendant. 

13  And then, once it goes back to the district 

14 court, what the district court may lawfully do would 

turn on the scope of the mandate, not on principles of 

16 the cross-appeal rule. 

17  JUSTICE STEVENS: But in this very case 

18 could the court of appeals said: We will grant the 

19 appellant a new sentencing hearing and send the case 

back to the district for resentencing; and, by the way, 

21 district judge, when you do the resentencing, take a 

22 look at the section that imposes a mandatory minimum? 

23 Could they have done that? 

24  MS. MAYNARD: If the court of appeals had 

found an error at the defendant's request, yes, 

17

1 Justice Stevens, and remanded it, depending on the scope 

2 of the mandate and under the scope of the mandate --

3  JUSTICE STEVENS: And you could have ended 

4 up with precisely the same result that they ended up 

with in this case. 

6  MS. MAYNARD: But it would have been a key 

7 difference in the sense that they would have found some 

8 of the defendant's claims on appeal correct. Here the 

9 court of appeals rejected all of the defendant's claims; 

and, nevertheless, in the absence of a government 

11 appeal, increased the Petitioner's sentence. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: So if the Court of Appeals 

13 had said that the sentence that was imposed by the 

14 district court was unreasonable by two months and 

accepted the defendant's argument to that extent and 

16 then remanded, on remand the district court could have 

17 corrected the sentence on the gun counts. 

18  MS. MAYNARD: It would have depended on how 

19 the mandate was worded. But if they vacated the 

sentence in its entirety and remanded it, the district 

21 court could have imposed a lawful sentence at that time. 

22 Yes. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though the 

24 prosecution didn't ask for it? I thought that you were 

relying on the division of authority between the 

18

1 executive, the prosecutor, and the court. And that is 

2 that a court reacts to the charges that the prosecutor 

3 brings, and if the prosecutor isn't asking for a higher 

4 sentence, the court has no authority to grant it.

 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor. In the court 

6 of appeals that is true. But I understood 

7 Justice Alito's hypothetical to posit a situation where 

8 at the defendant's request his sentence was vacated. 

9 And then what the district court could do on remand 

would depend on the scope of the mandate . 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not? Why wouldn't 

12 the prosecutor still have control and say: Judge, the 

13 government is asking for ten years, no more? 

14  MS. MAYNARD: Before the district court, 

Justice Ginsburg, the government would be required to 

16 press the law. And, as it did here, the law is that 

17 under 924(c) this is a second, or subsequent, conviction 

18 in count 10; and it is error. Petitioner should have 

19 been sentenced to a second, or subsequent, sentence of 

25 years on count 10. 

21  So if it were back in the district court and 

22 the district court were free under the scope of the 

23 court of appeals mandate to impose sentence, then the 

24 government would be obligated to argue the law before 

the district court. What --

4  If that's all the mandate says, does that 

authorize the district court to do the right thing under 

6 the law? 

7  MS. MAYNARD: The courts of appeals have 

8 different rules, Your Honor, about whether or not a 

9 general mandate of the type that you posit should be 

assumed to open up all issues for sentencing or not. 

11  And there's actually some disagreement in 

12 the circuit on what one assumes from a general mandate. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, actually rule 35 was 

14 changed because it used to be based on the mandate. But 

now rule 35 says you can reopen within seven days after 

16 the verdict or finding of guilty. So that would 

17 indicate under the rules that the mandate is irrelevant. 

18  MS. MAYNARD: Well, no, Your Honor. I think 

19 rule 35 speaks to what the district can do within seven 

days of renouncing the sentence. Once the sentence is 

21 timely appealed, if the defendant were to prevail or if 

22 the government were to prevail in a case in which the 

23 government had actually appealed and it were to be 

24 remanded, then the defendant --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Within the scope of the

1 appeal, which brings us right back to this case.
 

2  MS. MAYNARD: Within the scope of the
 

3 mandate.
 

4  JUSTICE SOUTER: I don't understand your
 

mandate rule as being consistent with your general 

6 theory of the case. Because if the court of appeals 

7 cannot order this kind of relief, how could it be that 

8 the court of appeals' mandate would authorize the 

9 relief?

 It would seem to me that you've either got 

11 to take the position that the mandate is, in effect, a 

12 kind of neutral order. The district courts may or may 

13 not have authority to do something after the mandate 

14 comes down. But I don't see how you can take the 

position that the mandate, itself, by the court of 

16 appeals will, itself, determine what the district court 

17 can do. 

18  MS. MAYNARD: Well --

19  JUSTICE SOUTER: Because, in effect, I think 

you are saying, by structuring the mandate in a certain 

21 way, the court of appeals can open the door to something 

22 that the court of appeals, itself, could not do. But by 

23 structuring the mandate in a different way, the court of 

24 appeals can cut off the possibility of district court 

orders of a sort that the court of appeals couldn't do.

1 And that seems -- that is what seems to me inconsistent 

2 with your theory of the limited court of appeals 

3 jurisdiction. 

4  MS. MAYNARD: I don't think it is anomalous, 

Your Honor, in a case in which the court of appeals has 

6 jurisdiction over a claim, grants the requested relief, 

7 and vacates the sentence. For then, what the district 

8 court can do can turn on the scope of the court of 

9 appeals mandate.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Now, let's 

11 consider -- assuming that the mandate leaves open -- the 

12 question open entirely for the district court. 

13  You said ultimately what the district court 

14 can do depends on the mandate. Can the court of appeals 

also by mandate say: And by the way, district court, 

16 because we couldn't increase the sentence here, you 

17 can't do it either? Is that open to the court of 

18 appeals? 

19  MS. MAYNARD: I don't know there's any court 

of appeals that has held that it could do that. It --

21  JUSTICE SOUTER: Then what is the play in 

22 the mandate that you are assuming when you say it 

23 depends on the mandate? What the district court can do 

24 would depend on the mandate.

3 does the court of appeals -- given the limits on what 

4 the court of appeals itself can order, what are the 

options that the court of appeals has in writing the 

6 mandate that will determine what the district court can 

7 do? What are you getting at. 

8  MS. MAYNARD: I'm not sure that that's -- I 

9 don't know the precise contours of that, Justice Souter, 

but if the court of appeals grants the Petitioner's 

11 request to vacate the sentence --

12  JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah. 

13  MS. MAYNARD: -- and then remands for 

14 resentencing, in a general way, that could leave open to 

the district court the ability to resentence. 

16  JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

17  MS. MAYNARD: But one --

18  JUSTICE SOUTER: Now you say that could 

19 leave open -- if a mandate is general, that could leave 

open. Can the mandate be specific in precluding?

3 Here --

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know about your 

initial premise. I -- I take it the policy here is that 

6 the defendant who appeals ought to know what's at stake 

7 in the appeal. He shouldn't be surprised. 

8  MS. MAYNARD: That's right. 

9  JUSTICE KENNEDY: If he cross-appeals, fine; 

if he doesn't cross-appeal, he knows what the stakes 

11 are. 

12  MS. MAYNARD: That's right. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But now you're saying that 

14 if the sentence is -- is vacated, they can start all 

over? That the district court can't start all over if 

16 it's still in the district court. Why should the court 

17 of appeals have any more authority than the district 

18 court does? 

19  MS. MAYNARD: Well, because it -- once 

the court -- if the Petitioner -- I mean -- at any risk 

21 in any appeal, and this is true in civil cases, too, you 

22 know, if you seek a new trial on damages, for example, 

23 in a civil case, because of instructional error, and you 

24 go back, I think, you know, the jury who decides the 

damages a second time isn't bound by the first jury's

1 decision. Any time --

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the -- the 

3 defendant who is appealing has to be very careful about 

4 the relief he requests? He says I don't want the 

sentence vacated; I want the sentence reduced to five 

6 years instead of 10. 

7  And nothing else? That's the only relief I 

8 seek? 

9  MS. MAYNARD: I think if the court of 

appeals finds error in the sentence it vacates under the 

11 -- the remedial provisions in 3742 for the -- for the 

12 court -- for the district court to resentence the 

13 Petitioner. 

14  For example --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well -- if that's the case, 

16 if the -- if the -- if it cannot be structured by the 

17 request for relief as the Chief Justice is suggesting, 

18 then on the Government's theory, in a case like this, if 

19 the defendant wins on appeal, he is in serious trouble 

when that case goes back to the district court; whereas 

21 if he loses, he can't be any worse off than he is now. 

22  That's a strange -- that's a strange rule. 

23  MS. MAYNARD: Well, if the defendant wins in 

24 the sentencing appeal, there -- there's always a chance 

that on -- on remand, the -- the district court will

1 reconfigure the sentence. 

2  JUSTICE SOUTER: But in effect that means 

3 then -- and this -- I didn't understand this to be your 

4 position -- but that means, in effect, that the 

cross-appeal rule is essentially, as you're arguing for 

6 it, a formality. It limits what the district court can 

7 do, but it is not a rule that embodies the notion that 

8 when a defendant appeals the defendant ought to know, in 

9 effect, what he can gain and what he can lose; because 

if, on your theory, if the defendant wins and there's a 

11 mandate back to the district court, it is wide open. 

12  MS. MAYNARD: Well, I think, you know, if 

13 you look at cases -- recent -- I think post-Booker for 

14 example --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I want to look at 

16 them but I want to know what your position is first. 

17 And I take it your position is that if the defendant 

18 wins, and he cannot by his request for leave limit the 

19 relief, as the Chief Justice suggested, then when the 

case goes back to the district court, in effect, the 

21 slate is totally blank and he's starting all over again 

22 and he is subject to -- to whatever outer limits he 

23 would have been subject to in the first instance. 

24  MS. MAYNARD: Right. I was going to use the 

Booker case as an example. Post-Booker, you know,

1 defendants have appeals, saying I was innocent, or 

2 mandatory Guidelines regime, and I want to be sentenced 

3 under the advisory Guidelines regime. And when those is 

4 cans have gone back, this -- courts of appeals have --

most of the courts of appeals have held that the 

6 district court is not bound by original sentence -- it's 

7 not free from the mandatory Guidelines. It can consider 

8 all the factors as instructed by the Court, and isn't 

9 simply decrease the sentence. And I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then the cross-appeals rule 

11 is essentially a rule of appellate court procedure and 

12 nothing more. 

13  MS. MAYNARD: Well, I think in this 

14 situation, actually -- it definitely is a rule of 

appellate court procedure. 

16  JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah. But --

18 mandatory --

do in the absence of a party pressing a claim before it.

4 of appeals in doing something illegal? I mean, they 

know that what they're authorizing, or imposing really, 

6 as a sentence is illegal. 

7  MS. MAYNARD: No. All they -- all they're 

8 doing, Your Honor, as we requested, is rejecting the 

9 Petitioner's claims on appeal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm reminded of what 

11 we do in statutory cases. If one party says this is, it 

12 should be read A, and the other party says it should be

9 cross-appeal in this case?

 MS. MAYNARD: There's nothing in the record 

11 to indicate why the government didn't cross-appeal, 

12 Justice Ginsburg. But there are good reasons why the 

13 government wouldn't cross-appeal in any given case. 

14 There are 8,000 plus adverse decisions against the 

government in 2007, and reasons why the government might 

16 not cross-appeal or appeal in a given case include the 

17 length of the sentence the person has already received, 

18 whether there's a need for clarification of a particular 

19 question of law, whether this is a recurring error --

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me many of 

2 these horribles really exist, however we decide this 

3 case. I don't know that anybody says that if there is 

4 not a firm rule requiring the -- a cross-appeal, I don't 

know that anybody says that the court of appeals must 

6 search the record and correct any errors below. 

7  MS. MAYNARD: Well, the amicus is 

8 arguing that's the meaning of 3742 --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It happens all the time,

19  MS. MAYNARD: Exactly, Your Honor. And that 

-- the danger to parties, in particular to the 

21 government in having courts reach out and arrogate to

1 it was plain --

2  JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask this one 

3 question? This problem has been around for a long, long 

4 time; and sometimes cross-appeals -- courts of appeals 

have corrected what they thought was plain error, and 

6 without a cross-appeal there. 

7  Has that generated a whole lot of problems 

8 over the years? I mean there are isolated cases that 

9 you've all been able to find searching 30 or 40 years of 

jurisprudence, but I don't see any widespread problem 

11 being generated by the courts of appeals who have 

12 disagreed with your view. 

13  MS. MAYNARD: Well, if I could make two 

14 points. The court of appeals actually found two errors 

that aggrieved the government here, Justice Stevens, and 

16 ruled for us only on one. So in a case where we didn't 

17 notice an appeal, on an issue we did not brief, the 

18 court of appeals ruled against us. 

19  And second, I'm aware of no case in this 

Court where this Court has reached out to find plain 

21 error on behalf of a nonpetitioning respondent or a

1  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY T. JORGENSEN, 

2  AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

3  IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW 

4  MR. JORGENSEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

6  There are three questions really in this 

7 case, and the Court need not resolve all of them 

8 depending upon how it resolves the others, but some of 

9 them get lost sometimes, so I would like to state what 

the three are. 

11  The three are first, does section 3742 

12 provide an answer? Is it an affirmative grant of power 

13 to the court of appeals to the Eighth Circuit to give 

14 the right answer when the Petitioner asked them is my 

sentence imposed in violation of law? Or is it a limit 

16 on the court's power telling them they cannot provide 

17 him with relief? That's the first question. 

18  If the Court concludes that it's neither --

19 if a Court a court concludes either that it is a grant 

of jurisdiction, or rather a power -- or that it's not, 

21 that it's an affirmative limit, then the -- if the Court 

22 concludes that 3742 is more like 1291, just a general 

23 appellate statute that does not give the answer here, 

24 then the Court has to go on to decide is this case -- is 

this rule, this cross-appeal rule, in the criminal 

32

1 context not the civil context that is -- that is subject 

2 of this 200 years of discussion, but in the criminal 

3 context is it a jurisdictional limit on what the courts 

4 can do or is it a rule of practice.

 And then finally, if the Court concludes --

6 if the Court concludes it is a jurisdictional limit, 

7 then that's the end. If the Court concludes that it is 

8 a rule of practice, the final third question is:  Is it 

9 a waivable rule of practice or is it a firm and 

inflexible rule of practice? I think what often gets 

11 assumed. But, of course, in Kontrick, in Bowles, the 

12 Court addresses the issue in that case -- in those cases 

13 and decides whether the rule of practice at issue in 

14 that case --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Jorgensen, suppose I 

16 think there's a larger anterior question to all of this? 

17 And that is what I suggested in the colloquy with 

18 Ms. Howe, we have a system in which the prosecutor can 

19 bring charges. The judge may think, my goodness, 

looking at this set of facts, you could have charged 

21 much more. 

22  The judge can't do that, he can't tell the 

23 prosecutor you have to charge "Y" in addition to "X". 

24 The government chooses not to appeal. Now, what right 

does the court say, I know you didn't appeal,

1 Government, but should have so we're going to take care 

2 of it for you? 

3  It seems to me that our system rests on a 

4 principle of party presentation as many systems do not. 

In many systems, the court does shape the controversy 

6 and can intrude issues on its own. But in our 

7 adversarial system, we rely on counsel to do that kind 

8 of thing. So, my problem with your whole position, 

9 without getting down to particular statutory provisions, 

is what business does the court have to put an issue in 

11 the case that counsel chose not to raise? 

12  MR. JORGENSEN: The answer to that question, 

13 Justice Ginsburg, is multi-part, and I'll try to move 

14 through it quickly. This Court had said -- made the 

very point that you made at the charging stage. That at 

16 the charging stage the court -- the district court 

17 cannot decide what a criminal will be charged with; but 

18 that once the trial has proceeded to judgment, that 

19 prosecutorial discretion is at an end. I wish I could 

remember the name of the case, but Justice Scalia was 

21 the author. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Me, too. 

23  (Laughter.) 

24  MR. JORGENSEN: The point being that once a 

crime has been proven, the law kicks in, and the

1 defendant must be sentenced in accordance with lawful. 

2 The same is true on appeal. I'm not advocating here 

3 for, I think, what your question would assume, which 

4 would be a roving court of jurisdiction -- a roving 

court of appeals that could reach out and take 

6 jurisdiction over a case that has not been brought to 

7 it. 

8  Under 3742 no one questions that the court 

9 has jurisdiction over the case, over the very sentencing 

issues because somebody has filed a notice of appeal and 

11 brought it to the court. The only question is when the 

12 defendant says to the court under 3742(a)(1) was my 

13 sentence imposed and the statutory languages in 

14 violation of law, can the Eighth Circuit provide the 

right answer or is it powerless to provide the right 

16 answer to only provide an answer that benefits him? 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: Could we discuss -- let's 

18 leave aside for the moment what the background rule of 

19 law is and discuss whether -- I guess it was your first 

point -- whether this particular statute proscribes the 

21 answer, and therefore, we don't have to go any further. 

22  Why do you say it proscribes the answer? 

23  MR. JORGENSEN: I believe that it does, 

24 Justice, because everybody agrees that the Sentencing 

Reform Act was a clean break with the past and imposed 

35

1 an entirely new regime. So, the talk about the regime 

2 of the past is somewhat beside the point. 

3  So then you get down to the language itself 

4 of section 3742. Under (a), it provides that a 

defendant may ask the court of appeals was my sentence 

6 imposed in violation of law; and under (b)(1), the 

7 government can raised same appeal. Then under (d), the 

8 parties certify to the court or bring to the court the 

9 record that they think addresses the issue that either 

side raised; and then in (e), the court -- (e) says the 

11 court shall decide whether it was imposed in violation 

12 of law; and then (f) (1) says if the court determines 

13 that it was imposed in violation of law, it shall send 

14 it back with instructions.

 Now, the main answer to that is well, 

16 (f)(1) -- you have to get all the way to (f)(1) before 

17 you have got the answer. And that's unsurprising. I 

18 don't think any member of the court would say that the 

19 Eighth Circuit lacks the power, is barred from noticing 

the 924(c) error here. 

21  Certainly the Eighth Circuit could see it; 

22 certainly the Eighth Circuit could say it. I see the 

23 error here. The only question is, can it provide the 

24 remedy? And that's what (f)(1) says.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why would -- why

1 would Congress want a different disposition for (f)(1) 

2 than for (f)(2)? It's clear under (f)(2) if the 

3 sentence is outside the applicable guidelines and the --

4 or if the departure is based on an impermissible factor 

or is to an unreasonable degree or the sentence was 

6 imposed for an offense for which there is no applicable 

7 guideline and its plainly unreasonable, for that, it is 

8 clear that if it hasn't been raised by one or the other 

9 party, the court doesn't get into it.

 Why would it want a different rule for those 

11 two? In other words, I'm saying that far from 

12 supporting your case, as your brief suggests, (f)(2) (a) 

13 and (a) seems to me harms your case. 

14  MR. JORGENSEN: If I can give a two-part 

answer, Justice. First, the court is not in the 

16 practice of overturning what the plain language says on 

17 a sort of legislative history or surmising what Congress 

18 may have been motivated by. But even if it were, there 

19 is a clear answer.

 (F)(1) subsumes (a)(1) and (a)(2) and (b)(1) 

21 and (b)(2). And the questions under those statutes or 

22 rather those provisions are legal questions. The kind 

23 of questions was this sentence imposed under (a)(1), 

24 (b)(1) in violation of law or (a)(2), (b)(2), was it an 

incorrect application of Sentencing Guidelines?

1  If the court of appeals gets that wrong, 

2 that's the kind of thing that's going to be imposed in 

3 everybody else's case. Under (3) and (4) it's this 

4 defendant's case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Wait, (2)(a) and (b) I 

6 thought -- do I not have this right, (2)(a) and (b) say 

7 the same thing as (1)? It says if the sentence is too 

8 high says the defendant's appeal, then what you do is 

9 you vacate it and send it back with such instructions as 

the court considers appropriate. 

11  MR. JORGENSEN: Indeed.

13 to do with the district court.

and it was the government that appealed, the court shall 

16 set it aside and send it back with such instructions as 

17 it considers appropriate, again subject to (g). 

18  So all three say the same thing. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: 

the defendant has appealed. 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23 the government has appealed.

1 government has appealed, you don't get any relief 

2 under -- under --

3  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, do you. If it's too 

4 high -- wait. Wait. If it is too -- ah.

 (Laughter.) 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: I see. 

7  MR. JORGENSEN: You're exactly right, 

8 Justice Scalia. So the question is, why would Congress 

9 say what is plainly said, which is under (f)(1) 

violations of law and incorrect applications of the 

11 Sentencing Guidelines, the court gives the right answer 

12 no matter who appeals. But under (f)(2) Congress 

13 specifies it matters under this who appeals. And the 

14 reason is, in those instances, it is too high in this 

defendant's case, and this defendant can be entrusted to 

16 forward his own cause; but under (a)(1) and (a)(2), then 

17 you get a court of appeals precedent that gives the 

18 wrong answer, if a question of law or the application of 

19 the Sentencing Guidelines.

 So there is a difference between (a)(1), 

21 (a)(2), (b)(1), (b)(2) as --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, that difference 

23 disappears if you say that, in fact, the whole thing 

24 assumes that the factor complained of has been brought 

to the court's attention by the proper person. So that

1 (f)(1) assumes that if it's the government appealing in 

2 violation of law because the defendant was given too 

3 little, or if it's the defendant appealing because in 

4 violation of law that he was given too much, it makes 

much more sense that way, it seems to me. 

6  MR. JORGENSEN: That -- that -- if the Court 

7 were to go there, Justice, I believe that goes back to 

8 you previous question of: Should we assume or should 

9 the Court believe that Congress was aware of its 

history --

11  JUSTICE BREYER: The way to do this then is 

12 -- is -- I see -- this section foresees basically what 

13 the other side is saying. It foresees it, because it's 

14 a very unusual case what happened here.

 MR. JORGENSEN: It is a very --

16  JUSTICE BREYER: So the way you should 

17 handle it, given this section, is the court of appeals 

18 would send -- I'm trying this on -- the court of appeals 

19 says, well, it's the defendant that appealed, who 

appealed. He says the sentence is too high. Given what 

21 we have in front us in the issues, he's right; now we've 

22 noticed that there's is other problems here. So what we 

23 do is send it back for resentencing. And, Judge, when 

24 you resentence, look at it. And see if maybe we're 

right. That would be a perfectly fair way to handle it, 

40

1 and a normal way to handle it. Is that right? 

2  MR. JORGENSEN: Well, importantly, Justice, 

3 one, two, three, and four, one being: Is it posed in 

4 violation of law? Two: Is it incorrection application 

of Sentencing Guideline (c)(3)? Or is it too high? 

6 There's a body of case law as to what kind of a field --

7 fields fit within what category. And the parties and 

8 the courts of appeals are united in believing that the 

9 Petitioner's question in this case fits within (a)(1): 

Was his sentence imposed in vital of law. 

11  But, as you know, the Court created the 

12 reasonableness question in Booker, and then the courts 

13 of appeals have agreed that that fits in within(a)(1). 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: But you don't have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not enough to say, 

16 well, we've noticed by the way we're -- you know, in 

17 looking at the proper appeal by the proper -- my 

18 goodness, look what we've noticed. 

19  It's not that. You're saying the court of 

appeals has to search the record. It has to make sure 

21 that there were no errors in favor -- or harming the 

22 other party who has not cross-appealed. 

23  And that's a considerable burden, as Judge 

24 Boudin's opinion on the court of appeals makes clear.

 MR. JORGENSEN: Indeed.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: And it's extraordinary. 

2  MR. JORGENSEN: Indeed, although it is what 

3 3742 says, and I believe it's actually not that 

4 different than what happens with jurisdictional issues. 

The court must resolve those that are brought to it. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Precisely so. 

7  MR. JORGENSEN: And then the court notices 

8 the ones that are obvious, has a duty to look for them 

9 because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is why we have tried 

11 to pare down what is jurisdictional. 

12  MR. JORGENSEN: And on that question, I --

13 before the time runs out, I want to, Justice Scalia, 

14 follow up on your question, which is: What if the Court 

assumes that 3742 does not provide the answer? Which is 

16 I believe where you're going. 

17  Then the Court confronts the question of, is 

18 the cross-appeal rule jurisdictional or a rule of 

19 practice? Now, the Court has provided the answer to 

that once in, I believe it said, Langnes, and said that 

21 it is a rule of practice. And then since, there's been 

22 obviously a long period of time. And then the Court has 

23 had its series of cases contra Bowles, Arbaugh. And 

24 under those cases, there is no good argument that it's 

jurisdictional. The teachings of those cases is that 

42

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 the Court has used the phrases "power" and 

2 "jurisdiction" too broadly, too loosely, and is now, as 

3 you say, trying to cut back on those jurisdictional 

4 limits. And a rule like this can only be jurisdictional 

if it's based on a statute, and I believe all the 

6 parties agree this rule is not based on a statute. 

7  So then that gets us finally to the question 

8 of, if 3742 does not provide the answer and it is a rule 

9 of practice, is it a mandatory rule of practice, an 

inflexible rule of practice? Or one where the Court can 

11 use discretion as to whether or not to apply it when 

12 it's invoked? 

13  And the -- there can be no question that 

14 there are discretionary rules of practice. Indeed, in 

Bowles, the one issue on which all nine Justices agreed 

16 is just that: Justice Souter, writing for the dissent, 

17 would have found that that rule or practice was 

18 discretionary. Justice Thomas, writing for --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it's 

discretionary, how would you -- I assume it's reviewable 

21 for abuse of discretion. 

22  MR. JORGENSEN: Indeed. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How would you know 

24 whether it's an abuse of discretion or not? I mean, the 

issue is going to be the same in every case. There was 

43

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 no cross-appeal. If there had been, we would have 

2 increased the sentence, and one court of appeals says, 

3 well, we're not going to do it; and the other court of 

4 appeals says, yes, we're going to do it.

 Which one is reversed for abuse of 

6 discretion? 

7  MR. JORGENSEN: I believe the one that 

8 refused to correct such a plain error, obviously. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought you might 

say that. But I mean --

11  (Laughter.) 

12  MR. JORGENSEN: But your question was, what 

13 is the standard? If I may, I believe that's the 

14 question. And the Court has, I think, provided the --

several formulations of what the standard is. In 

16 Langnes, the Court said good cause was the standard. In 

17 Reynolds, which contrary to what Petitioner said was a 

18 case where this Court afforded relief on a sentence to a 

19 criminal Petitioner who had not brought that issue to 

this --

21  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, could do you this? 

22 Because this is quite helpful to me. Reading, I started 

23 out where Justice Scalia was at the beginning of this 

24 argument. I thought the district court normally has it 

open, to the judge, to resentence. Resentence is 

44
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 resentence. You can't be vindictive, but that's the 

2 limit. That's how it works normally, I thought. 

3  And given -- if that's so, then you look at 

4 the three sections we just saw, try to read them 

together, and say they certainly are written with the 

6 notion that the noticing of a plain error on the other 

7 side is going to be few and far between if ever. 

8  So the normal way to handle it is just what 

9 we said: The judge decides on the record and the appeal 

-- I decide this for the defendant here. But I've 

11 noticed something, says the writing judge. And of 

12 course it's open on resentencing to go into that. 

13  MR. JORGENSEN: I --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: So if you were going to do 

something other than that, in the court of appeals, 

16 you'd have to have a reason, and it would have to be a 

17 fairly good reason. So you don't close off the escape 

18 hatch because we can't all foresee the future perfectly, 

19 but you say it's going to be few and far between.

 Now does that work? 

21  MR. JORGENSEN: I believe it does work, 

22 Justice Breyer. 

23  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 

24  MR. JORGENSEN: And I believe it --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This argument is not an 

45

5

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 argument under the statute? This is an argument giving 

2 your interpretation of what the background rule is? 

3  MR. JORGENSEN: I believe that's right. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: And you would limit the 

background rule to plain error? 

6  MR. JORGENSEN: Yes -- yes, Your Honor, I 

7 would. And that does not really contradict what the 

8 Eighth Circuit did here. Rule 52(b) is really another 

9 formulation of the very same thing that the court said 

in Langnes; that's good cause. In Neztsosie, it -- the 

11 Court phrased it "countervailing considerations" which 

12 outweigh the institutional interests in fair notice and 

13 repose. And, of course, rule 52(b) talks about 

14 "fairness, integrity, and public reputation of judicial 

proceedings." They're all different formulations of the 

16 same --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if it's such a 

18 --

19  MR. JORGENSEN: -- of the same --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If it's such a plain 

21 error, it's fair to to ask why the Government didn't 

22 cross-appeal. If you --

23  MR. JORGENSEN: There is nothing in the 

24 record here, Justice, on that. The Government has been 

very careful not to say or urge you on reply -- to ask.

1 I believe it was a blunder, and so to adopt --

2  JUSTICE SOUTER: A blunder? 

3  MR. JORGENSEN: A blunder. So, to adopt the 

4 Government's rule is to adopt a new -- a new 

exclusionary rule that the defendant goes free when the 

6 constable blunders. 

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if this were to be a 

8 more frequent occurrence, i.e., plain errors, then we 

9 were to rule for you and court of appeals generally 

would do this, then a defendant might think twice 

11 about appealing in a complex case. 

12  MR. JORGENSEN: That's true, Justice. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because there's nothing 

14 that could happen -- once the district court rules and 

the seven days for error goes by, there's nothing that 

16 anybody can do to raise it. 

17  MR. JORGENSEN: Well, the first part of your 

18 question was true, Justice Kennedy, but respectfully the 

19 second part was not.

 In the -- the way it currently works, under 

21 the rules, a defendant must file his notice of appeal 

22 before the Government files it. And so, as it currently 

23 stands, he makes his choice before he ever knows. There 

24 is no extra burden that would be placed on him.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, he doesn't have to 

47

1 pursue it if the Government appeals. 

2  MR. JORGENSEN: That's exactly right. And 

3 the Government makes that point that at some point, if 

4 the Government raises its appeal, he could strike a deal 

with them. Now, it's not correct to assume that he 

6 could then unilaterally walk away because there is a 

7 notice of appeal, the Government's notice of appeal. So 

8 he has to strike a deal with the Government at that 

9 point. That's no different than in this case. At oral 

argument, the Eighth Circuit asked both parties about 

11 this error. He could have struck a deal then. 

12  If this case turns on notice, there isn't a 

13 notice problem here. It's all over the record. It's 

14 raised at sentencing. It's raised on appeal. It's 

discussed in the briefs. It's discussed at oral 

16 argument. This error was known to all. 

17  Now --

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't understand that 

19 a party couldn't voluntarily withdraw a notice of 

appeal. 

21  I mean, suppose the only way that the court 

22 of appeals can get into this is because the defendant 

23 has pursued an appeal. 

24  Suppose this comes up and the defendant 

says, oh, my goodness, I stand to get 15 more years in

1 prison; I'm withdrawing my notice of appeal. There's 

2 nothing before the court of appeals then. Nothing. 

3  MR. JORGENSEN: That's a critical 

4 difference, Justice Ginsburg. You're exactly right that 

the court of appeals must have, under 3742, a notice of 

6 appeal, or it has no jurisdiction. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 

8  MR. JORGENSEN: But under the hypothetical 

9 we were discussing, I perhaps assumed incorrectly. I 

thought we were talking about the defendant files his 

11 notice of appeal before the Government ever files; then 

12 subsequently the Government files as well. Now, if the 

13 defendant withdraws, there's still a notice of appeal 

14 before the court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right. 

16  MR. JORGENSEN: But if the government had 

17 never filed, you're exactly right that the defendant 

18 could take his back. But the problem is it doesn't 

19 answer Justice Kennedy's question. His question was: 

Isn't a defendant entitled to know that he's -- that the 

21 Government might appeal, that he might be at risk, that 

22 there might be a problem here? And my point is he 

23 doesn't know under the current system anyway. He has to 

24 make his choice before the Government ever makes its 

choice. Now --

1  JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Jorgensen, may I take 

2 you back to something you mentioned earlier in the 

3 argument? And I thought I followed it at the time, and 

4 I may not have understood you.

 As I recall, you were explaining the
 

6 difference between (f)(1) and (f)(2)(A) and (B) by
 

7 saying that in (f)(1), which was -- which does not
 

8 embody any condition on who has appealed --

9  MR. JORGENSEN: Right.


 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the concern is that, if 

11 there is an error, it's an error which will in effect 

12 infect all cases. It's a circuit error, and it's 

13 potentially there for any case that comes along for 

14 sentencing; whereas, in (f)(2), if there's an error, the 

limited damage is simply to the case itself, to the 

16 particular defendant. 

17  Where I don't follow that reasoning is in 

18 the fact that F 1 refers not only to an incorrect -- to 

19 a violation of law, but incorrect application of 

sentencing guidelines, which would seem to include a --

21 the particulars of a given case. So am I either 

22 misunderstanding your argument or maybe misunderstanding 

23 subsection 1. 

24  MR. JORGENSEN: Well, Justice Souter, the 

lines between A 1, 2, 3, and 4 are not as bright as they 

50

1 might be. But when Congress enacted it, in response to 

2 Justice Scalia's question of why might Congress have 

3 done this when it wrote it, which was before Booker, 

4 which introduced some additional theory as to which of 

those four does an appeal fit within, one was: Is it 

6 imposed in violation of law? 

7  And, using that clear language, you can 

8 imagine the Congress would be concerned that violations 

9 of law not go unremedied.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: If that's all it said, I 

11 would certainly understand your distinction. 

12  MR. JORGENSEN: And then 2 is an incorrect 

13 application of the sentencing guidelines, which, again, 

14 at the time of the Sentencing Reform Act were intended 

to be, I believe, mandatory. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: So that it was a violation 

17 of law? 

18  MR. JORGENSEN: Indeed. There isn't that 

19 much of a difference between 1 and 2. But then when you 

get to 3 and 4, then you get into the language that 

21 addresses the particulars of this case: Was this 

22 defendant's -- was the application to this defendant too 

23 high based on an unreasonable fact or to an unreasonable 

24 degree, I believe is the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I guess the problem I still

1 have is some incorrect applications of the sentencing 

2 guidelines pre-Booker were, in fact, violations of law. 

3 But not all of them were, any more than all of them are 

4 now. But forget the situation now. Not all of them 

were. 

6  And I don't see how you can draw the sort of 

7 nonporous distinction that you are drawing. I mean it 

8 is a good try; but even pre-Booker there are some 

9 incorrect applications that could have been corrected on 

an abuse standard that were not properly described as 

11 violations of law per se. 

12  MR. JORGENSEN: I think that's right, 

13 Justice Souter. And I could only say that what we're 

14 doing here is we are hypothesizing why would Congress 

have said what they said; and it is a dangerous game to 

16 play. But that is my best hypothesis. But it does say 

17 what it says. 

18  Now, if I can return -- and I hope this is 

19 helpful -- to the questions that began the entire 

argument, which is the sentencing -- the sentence 

21 packaging rule or the sentencing package rule which 

22 Justice Breyer addressed, I believe the right answer to 

23 your question, Justice Stevens, is that under the way 

24 the sentencing package rule works, which is applied, I 

believe, by all circuits, is that if any part of a --

52

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: What do we mean by the 

2 "sentencing packaging rule"? 

3  MR. JORGENSEN: That's a very good question, 

4 Justice Scalia. Under section 3553(a) after the 

Sentencing Reform Act was imposed, judges were --

6 district judges were empowered and given the obligation 

7 to build a sentence that took into consideration a 

8 number of competeding factors such that you might, if 

9 you were a judge, a district judge, reduce a sentence 

under one count of an indictment if you were going to 

11 give more under another; and you put together a 

12 sentencing package; and then that's the sentence that 

13 the defendant receives. 

14  And then when that goes up on appeal, if any 

part of that package is undone, the whole package is 

16 undone. This is the rule that the circuits follow. 

17  To your question, Justice Ginsburg, I don't 

18 believe they have a precedent of this Court to fall --

19 to base that on. But it is the rule that is nearly 

uniformly followed. So then when the case goes back to 

21 the district court, the district court is free to 

22 construct a new sentence. 

23  So, as here, if the defendant had prevailed 

24 in any way, then back on remand the district judge could 

have imposed the same sentence. 

53

1  Now, a limit on that, Justice Scalia, is the 

2 vindictiveness cases. That if there is any evidence 

3 that the increased sentence, making the sentence the 

4 same or more is as a -- you know, it's a pay back --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Getting what he deserves, 

6 right? 

7  MR. JORGENSEN: Exactly. And that can't be 

8 done. But, otherwise, with that narrow exception, the 

9 sentence can be exactly the same, even though the 

defendant prevailed on appeal. 

11  Now, that played out exactly in this case. 

12 In this case, when it went back to the district court, 

13 the defendant said to the district court: Don't give me 

14 more. You can fit the new fifteen years within what I 

already have. Give me what I already have. 

16  And the District Judge said: No. I'm going 

17 to give you more. 

18  Now, the answer clearly, I think, cannot 

19 turn on the fact that the Seventh -- excuse me -- the 

Eighth Circuit knew the answer. We had some questions 

21 about what if the Eighth Circuit said: Well, I see an 

22 error here, but I don't know how it affects your 

23 sentence, so I am sending you back. Would that be okay? 

24  But it can't turn on the -- that the Seventh 

Circuit knew in this instance that he would get an 

54

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 increased sentence as versus it would be okay to send it 

2 back without saying what the effect would be for the 

3 district judge to impose. 

4  And, Justice Kennedy, your question was: 

What happens if there's a new trial? As my children 

6 would say, it is a complete do-over. When the trial 

7 starts all over again, new facts are found or not found, 

8 and the sentence is completely constructed all over 

9 again based on the facts as found by the jury in the 

second trial. 

11  If I can end, Justices, I would end by 

12 saying that I believe section 3742 does provide the 

13 answer here. Congress provided a clean break with the 

14 past. The idea that Congress was aware of a clear rule 

that they would have followed, I think, is contradicted 

16 by Reynolds, where this Court did the opposite; Langnes, 

17 where this Court said that the cross-appeal rule was a 

18 rule of practice, not a jurisdictional limit; and the 

19 confusion in the courts of appeals.

 I believe the answer to your question, 

21 justice Scalia, on whether it is well-established is 

22 that in the civil context I believe the D.C. Third, 

23 Fourth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits say that this is a 

24 rule of practice while the Senate has debated it back 

and forth.

1  And in Neztsosie the Court noted this 

2 confusion and noted, indeed, that some of the circuits 

3 are internally inconsistent as to what the rule is. 

4  It is slightly different in the criminal 

context. I believe the Eighth and the Tenth Circuits 

6 have not followed -- have not followed the rule, while 

7 the Second, Third, Fourth and Seventh have; and the 

8 Fifth is internally inconsistent. I may -- I may have 

9 some error, honestly, in that recitation. I did it from 

memory when you asked. 

11  But my point, I think, comes through no 

12 matter what, which is: How could Congress have assumed 

13 this is a clear rule and, when we write these words, the 

14 courts will know that's what we mean, when there's all 

this confusion amongst the courts?

1 this authorizes and, in fact, requires the court of 

2 appeals to determine whether any of the errors that are 

3 outlined in subsection (e) have occurred. But (e) can't 

4 possibly be this sort empowering, roving, free-standing 

authority that the amicus believes it is. 

6  Because if you look at the language of 

7 subsection (e), all it provides -- and this Court has 

8 recognized that it merely provides the scope of review 

9 -- that, upon review of the record, the court of appeals 

shall determine. It doesn't say anything about whether 

11 a notice of appeal has been filed, how the record got 

12 there. And to figure out those things you have to look 

13 at the structure of the statute. 

14  And when you look at the structure of the 

statute, it is clear that subsections (a) and (b) are 

16 the provisions that provide for appellate jurisdiction 

17 in sentencing cases. 

18  Amicus also tries to argue that, you know --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: (E) also contradicts (f) --

MR. HOWE: (F)(2)and then --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- (2)(A) and (B) because 

22 in some of those cases it doesn't determine that if the 

23 appeal has been brought by the wrong party. 

24  MS. HOWE: That's absolutely right. That 

merely provides the remedy, Justice Scalia.

1  And the amicus tries also to argue that this 

2 is not some sort of free-standing, roving appellate 

3 authority. That, you know, for example, if the case is 

4 brought under (A)(1), a violation of law, the court of 

appeals only needs to determine whether it is a 

6 violation of law. But he also argued that the court of 

7 appeals is not obligated to scour the record for errors. 

8 It is only to notice plain error. 

9  But if one should start placing these 

limits, these limits come from subsections (a) and (b) 

11 and the background of traditional appellate practice. 

12 And once you start placing these limits which do not 

13 appear in the text on subsection (e), the entire 

14 construction falls apart.

 The second point I would make is that the 

16 amicus argues that, somehow, section 3742 represents as 

17 a break from the past; that Congress did not have in 

18 mind the background of this well- established appellate 

19 procedure. But in section 3742 Congress made clear --

may I finish -- it was only providing for limited 

21 appellate review. 

22  And if you are going to treat sentencing 

23 cases differently in light of this court's historic 

24 practice of construing the availability of government 

appeals narrow rate, you need to treat -- you need to be
