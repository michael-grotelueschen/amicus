 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 06-1595, Crawford v. The Metropolitan 

Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee. 

Mr. Schnapper.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 When Vicky Crawford reported to city 

officials that she had been repeatedly harassed by the 

board's director of employee relations, her conduct was 

protected by section 704(a) of Title VII. It is 

protected first by the first clause of section 704(a), 

which is known as the opposition clause. The opposition 

clause has three elements that must be proven. Only one 

of them is at issue here. But just to set the context, 

first a plaintiff will have to prove that the employer 

acted with a retaliatory motive. Second, the employee's 

statement or conduct must relate to action that was 

unlawful under Title VII. It might be something that 

happened in the past. It might be a concern about 

something that might happen in the future.

 And third, the conduct must be in the nature

of opposition, and that's the question in dispute in 

this particular case.

 It is our view that the -- it is sufficient 

to establish that element if a reasonable person would 

conclude from the employee's statement or conduct that 

the employee disapproved of or objected to the 

employment practice in question.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So a co-worker of your 

client says: You know, the boss really was guilty of 

sexual harassment and the co-worker says: Gee, that's 

terrible.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes, yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's enough? That's 

opposition?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Yes, it is. In fact, 

there are cases involving --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if it's just, 

sexual harassment is terrible?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: That would be covered. If 

an employee wore a button --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if there's no 

link, there's no link to the person that the original --

the complainant says was engaged in that activity?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: The opposition doesn't have 

to be directed at a particular event.

JUSTICE SCALIA: What about, violating the 

law is terrible?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think if there's no 

reference to Title VII that wouldn't suffice.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. But if she said that 

in response to the remark by the co-worker that she had 

been subjected to sexual harassment and then the remark 

was "Violating the law is terrible," that's opposition?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think a trier of fact 

could conclude she was referring to what the co-worker 

had just said.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if Mr. Jones, the 

person, did that, that's terrible.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's actionable as 

opposition to the practices?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: It is protected. If the 

employer comes in and fires her for having said that. 

The case --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Schnapper --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to say in part 

it seems to me that in isolation it seems harmless, 

almost trivial, but the whole point is that the employer 

doesn't think it is trivial. The employer uses it, by 

hypothesis, as a basis to retaliate.

MR. SCHNAPPER: Right. That's why the 

elements are important. If the employer fires a worker 

for that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that doesn't solve the 

problem of having too broad an entry into this thing. 

You get to the jury by just showing that she said "Oh, 

if he did that, it's terrible," and then it's up to the 

jury all of a sudden whether that is the reason that the 

employer fired this person or not. I mean, that just 

leaves -- lays the employer open to a lot of jury 

determinations that he shouldn't be subject to, it seems 

to me.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: With all deference, Your 

Honor, the plaintiff must have sufficient evidence to 

get to the jury on all three elements. Retaliation 

claims are routinely dismissed on the causation element. 

There's not usually a dispute about whether the conduct 

was protected, and this case in that regard is unusual. 

But the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you believe, as I 

understood you to suggest a moment ago, that you could 

prove causation if the statement "It is terrible" or 

"Sexual harassment is terrible" had been uttered in 

effect in the abstract without reference to particular 

behavior or a charge of particular behavior on the part

of a co-worker or an employer? In other words, if A 

says "Sexual harassment is terrible" and elsewhere in 

the company sexual harassment is going on and A is then 

fired, would it be your view that A would at least state 

a claim if A said, I had expressed disapproval of sexual 

harassment, it turns out there was sexual harassment 

being gone -- taking place elsewhere; and I was fired 

for that reason. Would that at least state a claim that 

would get a harassment case into court?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Up --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What I'm getting at, 

doesn't the statement "It's terrible" or whatever the 

opposition may be have to be made in relation to some 

specific activity?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: No, Your Honor. No, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Then what is the limit? It 

seems to me you've got a cause of action in effect under 

the statute that would be virtually unlimited. Anybody 

who thinks sexual harassment is bad and later gets fired 

can claim retaliation under the statute if it turns out 

just as a matter of good luck that somebody was being 

sexually harassed unbeknownst to the speaker.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: That's at least two 

questions. Let me try to answer them both. With regard

to what would constitute protected activity, it is our 

view -- and I think this is consistent with the lower 

courts and the view of the government -- that there 

doesn't have to actually be a violation. If a worker 

walks into the office with a button saying "Violations 

of Title VII are bad and I'm against them," she can 

be -- and fired for that, that's illegal even though 

nothing was going wrong.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But why are we -- why are 

we spending so much time on hypotheticals that are so 

far from this case? This was a person who appeared at 

an internal proceeding, she gave testimony, very 

specific testimony. She wasn't saying: I'm against 

harassment. She said: This boss harassed me. It is 

about as specific as you get. So we're dealing with a 

particular case of somebody who was a witness in an 

internal investigation. Why do we have to reach the 

outer boundaries of this claim in this case?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: You do not, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but, you know, 

that's why we ask hypotheticals that aren't related to 

the specific facts, because we're interested in how 

broadly the proposition you're asking for goes. I'd 

still like to find out where you draw the limit. What 

if the person says: Mr. Jones would never do anything

like that, but if he did that would be terrible. Now, 

is that actionable as opposition?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Expressing 

disagreement with conduct that violates the law is what 

the opposition clause protects. It doesn't have to be 

about a specific instance, although it emphatically is 

so here. It doesn't have to reference the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And there does not have to 

have been sexual harassment in the employment unit.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: That's right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So this is a law directed 

against expressive activity.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Yes. Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are those laws good? I 

thought we had a First Amendment.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: No, no. It is a law that 

protect expressive activity and those laws are 

excellent. It protects the activity.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if the employee just 

made -- reports factual information: Supervisor did 

such and such; doesn't express opposition to it. Or 

what if the employee goes further and says: Supervisor 

did such and such, but I know he was just kidding; or I 

hope you don't take any action against that person. 

Would that be opposition?

MR. SCHNAPPER: Not necessarily. Again, it 

depends on the question that was asked and the answer 

that was given. If I might, for example, in this case 

the question was did Mr. Hughes engage in inappropriate 

activity. That was a request -- I think a trier of fact 

could understand that that was a request for a 

description of something that the witness objected to.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Let me ask this. Suppose 

the employer conducts an investigation because it 

believes that the supervisor has engaged in improper 

activity. So what they are trying to do is substantiate 

grounds for dismissal or some other sanction. And then 

an employee provides information that's exculpatory. 

Can -- is that protected? Is that -- is that 

information protected.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: It's our view that that is 

not protected by the opposition clause. It is our view 

it would be protected by the participation clause.

 If I might get back to the question --

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't it strange when there 

are many situations in which testimony or the reporting 

of information is protected, but when it's done, isn't 

it usually done both ways, as it is under the 

participation clause? So that the testimony is --

cannot be the subject of retaliation or the reporting of

information cannot be the subject of retaliation, but 

not it's protected only if it goes in one direction? 

Isn't that a very odd approach to that situation?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: That's why we're advancing 

the view that the participation clause here provides as 

well, so that it's clear that exculpatory witnesses are 

protected. It is not unimaginable that an exculpatory 

witness would anger someone.

 But going back to the question you asked 

earlier, it's possible that in response to a question an 

answer might be given which a reasonable person would 

not conclude reflected disapproval such as, well, he 

told that joke, and I thought it was funny.

 And, indeed, in the Harris v. Forklift case 

there were witnesses like that who -- who confirmed that 

the owner of Harris Forklift had made the jokes in 

question but said they didn't mind. That that would not 

be our position at --

JUSTICE ALITO: Wouldn't that be very 

strange? Suppose that this -- the factual situation 

actually is very severe and is enough to -- to establish 

liability on the employer's part, but this particular 

reporting employee doesn't think so. So then the 

employer might well be very annoyed that this 

information which can be the -- the basis for liability

has been brought out against the employer, and the 

employer might want to retaliate.

 Why would that be unprotected just because 

this employee adds his or her opinion that it isn't 

serious?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: We think it is protected by 

the participation clause.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why don't you follow what 

the EEOC says? I mean, the EEOC, as I understand it, 

has said the very fact the employer has initiated an 

investigation of an alleged discrimination is sufficient 

to demonstrate the reasonableness of the employee's 

belief that by providing information relevant to the 

inquiry she is opposing an employment practice made 

unlawful by Title VII.

 And then they go on. To be absolutely clear 

about it, they say an employee who assists her or her 

employer in the endeavor, i.e., you go and testify; so 

the sun was shining on that day; you are assisting your 

employee by telling the truth-- is by definition -- is 

opposing practices made unlawful by Title VII.

 So here we have a difficult question, quite 

an interstitial question, defining precisely "opposing," 

and here we have the EEOC doing it. So why don't we 

just follow what they say?

that would certainly be fine with us.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't be fine with 

me.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: We get to the same place --

we get to the same place by a different route.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if I am 

indeed very much in favor of sexual harassment? I am a 

world class sexual harasser, but I'm also not a liar, 

and I'm -- I am subpoenaed or called up by the employer 

in connection with this internal investigation and asked 

whether so-and-so harassed a particular worker. And I'd 

say, yes, as a matter of fact, he did, and a good thing 

too.

 Is that expressing opposition?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: No. We believe it is 

covered by the participation clause. We think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Covered by the 

participation clause?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Because our view is that the 

employer's internal processes for detecting and rooting 

out sexual harassment, for example, is a -- is a process 

-- is a process that's under this title within the 

meaning of --

mean, let's suppose the opposition clause protects 

everybody in the internal investigation who could be at 

all interpreted as favorable to the complainant. It 

also protects everybody who could possibly be viewed as 

neutral.

 Then you have a problem about what about a 

person who loves sexual harassment? This is the 

hypothetical: he comes in, testifies: I love sexual 

harassment; it's wonderful, and they fire him. Now is 

this a real problem?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: It -- it is not, Your Honor. 

But -- but as the -- as the Chief Justice pointed out, 

I'm -- you know, I'm here to answer hypothetical 

questions, and I'm going to do so.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that --

[Laughter.]

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought that the --

real case -- the real case that we're dealing with is 

somebody who appeared in an internal investigation, and 

I thought that what was the debate between the two 

sides; anyone who made a charge, testified, assisted, or 

participated in any manner in the investigation, I 

thought that the other side's position was, well, this 

is not an "investigation" within the meaning of the 

statute. That what goes on internally doesn't qualify.

"Investigation," "proceeding," or "hearing" 

under Title VII requires first that there be a Title VII 

charge. I thought that that's what the controversy 

we're talking about today is about: Is this a 

qualifying investigation?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Your Honor, there actually 

are two distinct questions here. One of them is whether 

the conduct is protected by the opposition clause and 

whether it constitutes opposition.

 The second question is whether this conduct 

is protected by the participation clause and would be an 

investigation under Title VII. We are asserting 

arguments under both claims, and -- and the Respondents 

disagree with us on both.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And those are 

overlapping but not whatever it -- concurring --

MR. SCHNAPPER: Redundant.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- positions. You 

can oppose without participating. You can participate 

without opposing.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Right. Right. This case is 

both. But -- but there are circumstances which are only 

one or the other.

 And this is -- this is a statute that --

that is deliberately written with overlapping provisions

to be sure nothing is missed.

 In the phrase in the Fort Stewart case, I 

think, Justice Scalia, it is ex abundante cotilla, out 

of an abundance of caution, or in modern terms boots --

belt and suspenders. So these are deliberately 

overlapping provisions to -- to assure that --

JUSTICE ALITO: What is the test for 

determining whether an investigation has been done, and 

the person has testified? What degree of formality, if 

anything, is necessary?

 If -- if somebody in -- in the company 

simply goes to the office of an employee or the 

workplace of an employee or encounters the employee in 

the hallway or someplace and asks a question, is that 

enough? Does it have to be --

MR. SCHNAPPER: No.

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- a sort of a formal 

proceeding in -- in some sense?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: It -- it -- in our view, it 

doesn't have to be formal, but there are two essential 

elements to an investigation or a proceeding or anything 

other internal being under this title. The first is 

that the employer must have a rule or policy forbidding 

the type of discrimination in question which is similar 

to the requirements in section 706(c) for State and

local agencies.

 Second, the individual -- the official who 

did whatever you describe has to have been specifically 

authorized by the employer to play that role. Vicarious 

here wouldn't cover it.

 If I could reserve the balance.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT 

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court.

 We think this case is best resolved under 

the opposition clause, and that clause does not require 

employees to utter magic words of opposition or to 

initiate the interview in which they express opposition 

to unlawful conduct. Rather, the clause is satisfied 

when a reasonable person would understand that the 

employee has objected to sexual harassment in the 

workplace.

 And when an employee discloses or reports 

that she has been subject to unlawful sexual harassment, 

a reasonable person could certainly infer that the

employee opposes a practice made unlawful by the 

statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In that case, 

doesn't the opposing employee herself have a direct 

cause of action under Title VII? Given what 

Ms. Crawford described, you know, "that happened to me, 

too," she could proceed under Title VII herself.

 MS. BLATT: Right. She has got timing 

requirements. So if she hasn't complained to the EEOC 

within the relevant time, she wouldn't have a cause of 

action for discrimination. But once she has 

retaliated -- an adverse action is taken against her 

because of what she has reported, then she has timing 

requirements on when she has to sue for the retaliation, 

and she did that here.

 And this is a case where the Sixth Circuit 

tossed the case out on summary judgment, and it erred in 

doing so because the facts alleged in this case were 

more than ample to survive summary judgment on the 

question of whether she opposed what the Director of 

Employee Relations did to her.

 She alleged that in the context of a sexual 

harassment investigation in which she was asked to 

disclose inappropriate behavior by the director, she 

reported repeated instances of offensive, objectionable,

and unwelcome conduct by him. For instance, she said 

that she had her head pulled into his lap and that in 

response she threw him out of the office, thereby 

indicating that she did not like this conduct.

 The jury could easily infer from those facts 

that she opposed the director's conduct. Now, that 

timing would --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would you go as far 

as Mr. Schnapper in determining what constitutes 

"opposition"? I mean, do you agree with him that a case 

where somebody says, "oh, Mr. Jones would never do that, 

and if he did, I think that would be awful" -- is that 

"opposition"?

 MS. BLATT: If you -- yes, if a reasonable 

person could infer that. I think that we are similar.

 But if you just are a reporter of unlawful 

conduct, that's enough. But this case is easier, much 

easier. She was a victim.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, yes, I know, 

but -- I know, but --

MS. BLATT: I understand that. And if --

you can either decide the broader question or the 

question of the Petitioner here, which she reported that 

she was subject, and it makes it all the more evident, 

and certainly a jury could have found that she opposed

the conduct.

 But we do think that at least a reasonable 

inference could be drawn -- when you report facts that 

would constitute unlawful activity, the reasonable 

inference is that you have objected.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Facts that would 

constitute unlawful activity. What about facts that --

I mean, many of these cases, of course, are 

he-said/she-said cases, and what about the facts that 

you are reporting confirm one side or the other? They 

just ask you, look -- and, you know, the person says, 

"Well, every day at three o'clock he came in and do 

this," and you're outside. And he says, "No, I wasn't 

there."

 MS. BLATT: Right. If you just have a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you opposing it 

if you say -- you know, you are asked, "Well, you know, 

you sit outside the office; did he come in there or 

not?" And you say, "Yes, he did."

 MS. BLATT: I think this is where we have 

not embraced the position of the EEOC, that we don't 

think that expresses opposition if all you do is say, 

"here's what a person's job duties were and he was in 

town on that day" or "I had lunch with him on that day," 

and that would verify -- it may verify a victim's

statement or corroborate it and thereby be the essential 

evidence in the case, but it wouldn't come within the 

statutory language of opposing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even you knew that 

that was the critical fact in resolving the complaint?

 MS. BLATT: If a reasonable -- well, if a 

reasonable person knew from all the circumstances, then 

maybe. If this -- unfortunately, if you don't like jury 

trials, this is a jury question whether you oppose the 

practice or not, and it would have to go to a jury based 

on the totality of the evidence.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, since this is a case 

where the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that the 

participation clause is the line of least resistance. I 

understand we have to say what a hearing is and so 

forth. Are you asking us to resolve on the opposition 

clause because that will give more guidance to the 

system or --

MS. BLATT: No. When you said "least 

resistance," it certainly is the most sweeping and broad 

coverage. In that sense, you cover all witnesses and 

participants in the process, and we think Congress 

intended to do so here.

clause is?

 MS. BLATT: The participation clause is much 

broader coverage. It could -- it would cover anyone who 

participates in the investigation, whether or not they 

oppose the practice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it depends how 

you define the investigation --

MS. BLATT: Opposition.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the inquiry, and 

that's kind of a tough issue, it seems to me.

 MS. BLATT: If this were before the EEOC, 

everybody who testifies in that proceeding or 

participates in the investigation would be covered. It 

doesn't matter whether you oppose a practice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

 MS. BLATT: So in that sense, it's broader. 

The reason why this case is easier for you, under the 

opposition clause, is it's a narrow holding and it 

doesn't get you into the question of whether just an 

employer investigation is an investigation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess the 

question I was asking earlier, you have overlapping but 

not concentric categories, so the "opposing" may be 

broader than the "participating in" depending upon how 

we define either one.

MS. BLATT: That's exactly right, but at a 

minimum when you have a victim of sexual harassment who 

reports it to her employer in the context of an 

investigation where she's asked was there anything 

inappropriate and she recounts here, it's so clearly 

opposition. It so clearly should not have been thrown 

out on summary judgment. And it so clearly can force --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You think -- you think the 

conduct in this case is also covered by the 

participation clause?

 MS. BLATT: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You do?

 MS. BLATT: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The problem with that is 

that I -- while I have the EEOC with me, say, on --

assuming your thing -- on, from what I read, on the 

opposition clause, when I looked into what the EEOC 

actually said here on the participation clause, I don't 

think I can characterize it, except for their litigation 

position.

 MS. BLATT: But that --

JUSTICE BREYER: I can't characterize what 

they've said in their compliance manual as being with 

you on that.

 MS. BLATT: That's correct. We don't and

change it. They could easily change it.

 MS. BLATT: Yes, it is true that it's in a 

brief, it's on their Website, it's on home page, on 

their Website.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. It's not in their 

manual.

 MS. BLATT: It's not in their compliance 

manual; it's in our amicus brief, but it is the EEOC's 

position. And, again, that's why I think it's an easier 

case for you under the opposition clause.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Can you think of any other 

situation in which the law says that a person who 

testifies or provides information is protected against 

retaliation only if that person gives testimony of a 

particular type or gives a statement of a particular 

type?

 MS. BLATT: No, but you have to remember 

there are two separate clauses. The statute under the 

opposition clause just says "oppose a practice made 

unlawful." If you didn't oppose a practice, you're not 

covered under that. You would be covered under -- in 

the proceeding, why there is such broad coverage. Once

you're under the participation clause, no matter what 

the substance of your testimony is, it's covered. It 

protects the process itself, regardless of whether it 

was -- it was determined true.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I understand that, but 

I'm -- what I'm asking is, is the reason to doubt 

whether Congress intended in the opposition clause to 

provide protection only for people who testify or 

provide information that goes in a particular direction?

 MS. BLATT: I think --

JUSTICE ALITO: If the purpose is to -- is 

to elicit information and protect the people who come 

forward with the information, then why don't you provide 

the protection irrespective of what the person says?

 MS. BLATT: I think that position is 

consistent with the EEOC, and I don't think we would 

oppose that position in the sense that it would give the 

greatest and broadest protection.

 And what is so upsetting about this case is 

the gaping hole in statutory coverage that the Sixth 

Circuit left. It is an inexplicable gap that a 

complaining witness in an employer investigation would 

be unprotected from retaliation. The statute simply 

can't function, as intended by Congress, as intended by 

this Court, if there are all these incentives for

employees to investigate unlawful activity, witnesses 

come forward and report that they, in fact, have been 

subjected to sexual harassment, and employers are free 

to retaliate. They --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that's a very 

strong argument for the participation clause.

 MS. BLATT: It is. It is, but it's all the 

more reason that she has to be covered under one of them 

if not both of them. Witnesses simply are going to be 

afraid to fully cooperate if they're not given 

protection.

 And if there are no questions, we'd ask that 

the Sixth Circuit be --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the other side 

says this is not an investigation. There was no charge 

filed. She's filed no charge. So this is not a 

qualifying investigation. What is the government's 

position on that?

 MS. BLATT: Well, I mean, we think that is 

border-line absurd, although all courts that have 

reached the issue have held that. And it just -- it 

makes no sense, and it -- I'm not even --

held what?

internal investigation is covered as long as somebody 

has filed a charge. It's not clear who or that it has 

to be related to the subject matter. And that would 

mean if the investigation is conducted on the day a 

charge is filed at noon, all the witnesses who came in, 

in the morning, are unprotected; yet all the witnesses 

who came in, in the afternoon, would be protected. Yet 

nobody even knows that a charge has been filed. And 

that's just not something that Congress possibly could 

have intended and wanted to leave the morning witnesses 

unprotected from retaliation.

 So I don't think the current state of the 

law under the participation clause is supported by the 

text, and it's certainly not supported by any policy 

under Title VII.

 No questions?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Young.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS H. YOUNG

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. YOUNG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 Title VII was the result of a congressional 

compromise which struck a balance between protecting the 

interests of employees and employers.

In relation to the anti-retaliation 

provisions of section 704, that balance was struck to 

protect the rights of employees to report allegedly 

discriminatory activity, as well as employers' rights to 

manage their workplaces. The participation clause 

covers activity or conduct in the course of an 

investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII.

 The opposition clause -- the actual words of 

the opposition clause protect an employee who has 

opposed a particular unlawful practice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what more 

could Ms. Crawford do to make it clear that she opposes 

what was alleged in this case?

 MR. YOUNG: She could have -- she could have 

initiated making contact with the government official to 

register a complaint or an objection.

 Instead, she made a disclosure or she 

cooperated in the investigation, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how can the 

fact that what led to the statement change the 

characterization of the statement? She can initiate it, 

go in and say, "I oppose what's going on," or if 

somebody just asks her, you know, "how do you feel about 

what's going on," she says she opposes it. It seems to 

me in either case you look at the statement and not what

led to the statement.

 MR. YOUNG: Congress chose to use the word 

"oppose," Your Honor. That's why the short --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's why my 

hypothetical uses the word "oppose." In the first case, 

she goes in of own volition and says, "I oppose"; in the 

second case, she says "I oppose" in response to a 

question. Congress used the word "oppose," and my 

hypothetical in both cases used the word "oppose."

 MR. YOUNG: If she's not taking the 

initiative, then she has to report it and request that 

something be done about it. Does the word -- if she 

uses the word "oppose," as in your hypothetical, that 

would not be the facts of this case, but that would 

probably nudge it to the line of opposition conduct 

because she's using the word "oppose."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. Well, is it 

real a magic word? She comes in and says, "you won't 

believe" -- you know -- "you think that's bad, wait till 

I tell you what he did to me," and goes on tells -- it's 

quite obvious from the context that she opposes it.

 MR. YOUNG: Well, that's why we advocate a 

reasonableness standard, Your Honor, in the ears of the 

person receiving the information, but under the facts of 

this case, that standard was not met.

The true opposition activity -- it's called 

the opposition clause, not the disclosure clause, not 

the cooperation clause. There's an element -- and all 

the parties have provided the Court with a dictionary --

the various dictionary definitions of the word "oppose," 

all of which contain the common theme of resistance, 

coming up against something, communicating resistance.

 When the -- when what Mrs. Crawford said to 

the human resources investigator in response to 

questioning is actually examined, it is making a 

disclosure. There's no request that anything be done 

about it. The time lag between the end of the alleged 

harassment and the actual reporting is over two months. 

Mrs. Crawford had multiple opportunities to report to 

her supervisor, her supervisor's supervisor, the 

director of employee --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You mean if she had made 

complaints after she had answered the questions in --

and given the information at issue here, that would 

convert her prior statements into opposition?

 MR. YOUNG: That would -- the fact that Your 

Honor chose the term "complaint" would be a different 

situation from what we had here. A subsequent --

call active opposition; and I took it from what you said 

a moment ago that if she had given the evidence in 

question here, and then in the period, subsequent period 

of two months, made some sort of complaint, that that 

complaint would have qualified her original evidence as 

opposition.

 Is that your position?

 MR. YOUNG: That complaint would undoubtedly 

be opposition. Would it reach back --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You're taking about --

MR. YOUNG: Would it retroactively imbue the 

initial disclosure with an opposition quality? Yes. 

Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It would? Why? It doesn't 

seem so to me. I mean, it either was or wasn't. You're 

making the argument, essentially, that "oppose" has two 

quite different meanings. You can ask somebody, you 

know, do you oppose the war in Iraq? And all you're 

asking is what is your opinion of the war in Iraq. Do 

you think it is good or bad?

 But "oppose" is also used in a quite 

different sense. He -- you say somebody opposed the war 

in Iraq, you mean he went out and -- and paraded against 

it and so forth.

 And your assertion is that in this

legislation, it has the latter meaning. It just doesn't 

ask for your opinion about whether sexual harassment is 

good or bad. It asks whether you were actively --

actively opposing it.

 Now, once you adopt that position, I don't 

see how the fact that you -- that something that was not 

active opposition can be converted into active 

opposition by something that occurred later.

 I mean, if you want to abandon your other 

argument, that's fine with me, but --

(Laughter.)

 MR. YOUNG: Your Honor, I'm uncomfortable 

with the concept that subsequent -- a subsequent 

complaint can imbue a prior statement with that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would that uncomfortable? 

Say it doesn't. I mean, I -- I don't care if you're 

uncomfortable with it. Does it or doesn't it?

 MR. YOUNG: Perhaps yes. But if it does --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Then I don't understand 

your case.

 MR. YOUNG: Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't 

see that distinction as being relevant. Because if --

if a subsequent complaint is made a month, two months 

after the initial disclosing conduct, then we're -- then 

we're traveling on that subsequent complaint.

And the fact that a disclosure was made a 

month or two prior doesn't become a relevant watershed 

date in terms of when the protections of the statute 

arise.

 The -- the -- the concept is something more 

than disclosure, something more than mere cooperation. 

The language of the statute is he or she has opposed a 

specific practice, not just opposition to the war in 

Iraq in general; not just opposition to sexual 

harassment in general; but that a specific --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It isn't just a specific --

again, if I don't understand your case, it isn't just a 

matter of the specific practice.

 Your point is it is not asking your opinion. 

It is asking whether you are actively trying to 

eliminate it.

 I think even if -- if you were asked your 

opinion, you know, do you -- do you oppose what, you 

know, what this supervisor did? And -- and you said 

yes, I don't favor it, I think it's bad, I think it's a 

bad idea, I -- as I understand your case, that's not 

opposition.

 MR. YOUNG: Your Honor --

specific act of harassment as opposed to putting it in 

the context of harassment in general.

 You -- you -- if you're hiding behind the --

the defenses you've built up, it seems to me those 

defenses require something more than an expression of 

your opinion of whether it's good or bad.

 Your opinion is whether it's good or bad is 

not opposition.

 MR. YOUNG: I agree with that, Your Honor. 

I used the term "practice" inartfully. Our argument is 

there is a specific act that the employee considers to 

be unlawful, and that's what the employee is opposing. 

So that is what needs to be communicated to a reasonable 

person within the government or within --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If the -- if the employee 

in response to the inquiry that's being made says yes, I 

saw my employer do "X" and it happened -- and I think 

it's terrible, that is certainly specific to the act.

 MR. YOUNG: It's specific to the act, Your 

Honor, but I -- I would argue that does not cross the 

line into "and I oppose it."

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the reason -- but the 

reason it doesn't cross the line is you are, in effect, 

saying that "oppose" within the meaning of the statute 

has got to be read more narrowly than the -- than the

notion of oppose as we commonly use that word in common 

speech.

 And I don't know why -- I don't know what 

your -- what your authority is for saying that "oppose" 

was not used in its commonsense everyday connotation.

 MR. YOUNG: Well, I think the word "oppose" 

can be used in a specific sense in common everyday 

speech and can be used in a general sense, Your Honor. 

And I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But in my hypothetical, 

we're not talking about a general sense. In my 

hypothetical we were talking about a reference to a very 

specific act. So the generality problem doesn't arise. 

And yet despite the specificity, you say, and despite 

the fact that in common speech a -- a specific statement 

like that would be taken as opposition, you say it 

shouldn't be under the statute.

 And the statute doesn't have any definition 

that narrows it. Common speech wouldn't narrow it your 

way.

 Why should it be narrowed your way?

 MR. YOUNG: The -- Your Honor's hypothetical 

of saying something is terrible would -- would -- would 

not be commonly understood to communicate opposition

case, "get the hell out of my office," wouldn't that be 

opposition even under your statement, under your

an active opposition it seems.

 MR. YOUNG: Well, the -- because the -- in 

the context of anti-retaliation provisions, making a 

statement to an alleged harasser to stop the harassment 

or get out of my office does not rise to opposition 

conduct, because the -- the -- the essence of the 

opposition clause is somehow putting the employer on 

notice.

 If every employee who was a victim of sexual 

harassment and says stop, if that -- if that constitutes 

opposition conduct under the retaliation clause, 

suddenly that employee has two causes of action, one for

sexual harassment and one for retaliation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that isn't even --

look, the best way to oppose a crime is to cooperate 

with the police when they investigate individual 

instances.

 The best way to oppose sexual discrimination 

in the workplace is to cooperate with the employer when, 

in fact, he investigates individual instances.

 Is what I've just said English? Does it 

make sense? And indeed, I'm just quoting the EEOC's own 

definition.

 MR. YOUNG: Yes, it was in English. Yes, it 

makes sense, Your Honor, but I would beg to differ, 

respectfully. The best way to oppose sexual harassment 

is to go and make a complaint about it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It is your opinion. The 

EEOC's opinion is, as they state, the best way to oppose 

is to cooperate.

 Now, what are we to do with, at 

least ambiguity, giving you that, I'll give you 

ambiguity. But we have the agency charged with the 

enforcement of this taking the side of it that is the 

opposite side that you are taking.

 MR. YOUNG: Yes, Your Honor. There is --

there are enough contradictory statements in the

Court is inclined to give to the EEOC's compliance 

manual should be tempered by the fact that even the EEOC 

recognizes the importance of employees taking initiative 

to report harassment and not --

waiting for the investigation to come to them.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The investigation is not 

of her. She's testifying as a witness.

 MR. YOUNG: She's offering a statement in an 

interview, Your Honor, as a witness, yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And this is an act that's 

meant to protect people against discrimination in the 

workplace, including harassment.

 MR. YOUNG: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is a woman who 

testified truthfully -- we have to assume that because 

this was tossed out at the very threshold, so we have to 

assume that everything she alleged in her complaint is 

true, right?

 MR. YOUNG: It is not up -- it is not before

allegations are true, Your Honor; but it comes to the

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is no -- no dis --

then there has to be no genuine dispute as to any 

material fact. That means we must take her allegations 

of fact as true at this point.

 But in any case this is a statute that's 

meant to govern the workplace with all of its realities.

 One of them was when they asked, well, why 

didn't you make a complaint, use whatever internal 

remedies are there are? She said, because the person in 

this outfit who is charged with receiving complaints is 

the harasser.

 MR. YOUNG: That isn't -- that was her 

contention. That's not necessarily true.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we have to --

everything -- for you to prevail, since there has been 

no trial on the facts, we have to take the facts as she 

alleges them.

 MR. YOUNG: There are multiple places to 

report sexual harassment, Your Honor. She -- she didn't 

even report it to her boss. She didn't report it to her 

boss's boss, and she didn't report it to the Director of 

Human Resources.

didn't report it. In order to recover here she has to 

have taken a public stand; and whatever the reason why 

she didn't, the fact is that she didn't.

 Why do you get into, you know, the reason 

that she didn't?

 MR. YOUNG: I agree with you, Your Honor. 

The reasons why she didn't make a report are immaterial.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and I suppose that 

you -- you would require the -- the opposition to be 

somehow a public -- a public expression of opposition. 

No?

 MR. YOUNG: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, if one political 

candidate says that the other one opposed the war in 

Iraq, do you think the other candidate could say, that's 

a lie? I'm sorry, that the charge would be held to be 

correct if, in fact, the other candidate had never said 

anything about the war in Iraq, although deep in his 

heart he thought it was probably a bad idea.

 Would you say that he opposed the war in 

Iraq? I don't think so.

that's your position as to the meaning of --

MR. YOUNG: Yes, Your Honor. And even the 

EEOC in its own compliance manual as set forth on page 

38 of the red brief, the examples of opposition cited by 

the EEOC are threatening to file a charge, complaining, 

protesting, picketing. These are active verbs.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why wouldn't this fall 

within the participation clause? There was an 

investigation, and -- and you described the people who 

provided information as "witnesses."

 MR. YOUNG: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So why doesn't it fall under 

the participation clause?

 MR. YOUNG: An -- an employer's internal 

sexual harassment investigation is not an investigation 

under this title.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Never, even after -- even 

after a charge has been filed with the EEOC?

 MR. YOUNG: Well, the five circuits that 

have squarely considered the issue have held that that's 

the trigger that brings the internal investigation under 

the rubric of the participation clause here, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And what's your argument?

 MR. YOUNG: I'll -- I'll take that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how about taking our 

decisions in the Faragher and Ellerth case which in a 

sense made the employer's internal investigation part of 

the EEO process because it says to the employer, if you 

don't have that find of effective internal complaint and 

investigation procedure, then you're going to be stuck 

on respondeat superior liability. If you do, then you 

will be shielded.

 So this Court's decision in those two cases 

seemed to me to say to every employer, as part of your 

EEO compliance you had better have this internal 

complaint procedure and investigation.

 MR. YOUNG: I agree. Faragher and Ellerth 

put the carrot on the stick in front of the employers 

and say, here's an affirmative defense that will be 

available to you in certain harassment cases if you 

adopt a -- an anti-harassment policy which includes an 

investigation mechanism. However, such a policy and 

such a mechanism is not made mandatory by Faragher and 

Ellerth. The argument of --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you say it's not made 

mandatory. Any employer who doesn't go through it is 

crazy. And I don't see how this Court, having imposed 

in practical terms the requirement that Justice Ginsburg 

just described, can then say, oh, but we're going to

construe this indefinite term of "investigation" 

to exclude this kind of employer activity which our 

construction of the statute has virtually mandated.

 So that if in fact the employer's 

investigation succeeds in ending the problem and there 

is no EEOC complaint, those who participated in the 

investigation are absolutely helpless against 

retaliation. That would be a bizarre way to interpret a 

-- a statute in which we have any -- any opportunity to 

interpret "investigation" to include this kind of 

investigation.

 What do you say to that?

 MR. YOUNG: The fact that Faragher and 

Ellerth create an incentive to employers to develop 

these policies with investigate -- which include 

investigations, does not elevate such investigations to 

fall under the statutory requirement of being --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No. But I'm -- I'm giving 

you an argument as to why we should construe it to 

elevate it, and -- and the argument is that we, in 

effect, in what I think were correct decisions -- you 

agree, you said a moment ago, were correct decisions --

have in practical terms mandated this kind of an 

inquiry.

 Why then would it be reasonable for us, if

we have any option in construing the term 

"investigation," to construe it to exclude this kind of 

investigation and exclude coverage of the people who 

under our decisions are supposed to come forward and --

and answer questions? Why would that be a reasonable 

construction?

 MR. YOUNG: Because at some point, Your 

Honor, the construction departs so far from what can 

reasonably be supported by the language of the statute 

itself that it --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why isn't it -- why 

isn't an investigation by the employer an 

"investigation"? That's the language of the statute.

 MR. YOUNG: It -- it is an "investigation." 

Our contention is it does not fall under the category of 

an "investigation" under this title even despite 

Faragher and Ellerth.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought Faragher 

and Ellerth --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why couldn't he -- I'm 

sorry, Chief Justice.

and Ellerth were limited to the hostile work environment 

cases.

that's true, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well -- well, that's 

a different question.  Is the defense we recognized in 

Ellerth and Faragher in the hostile work environment 

case or in the specific action case as well?

 MR. YOUNG: My understanding of Faragher and 

Ellerth is that it -- it applies in the hostile work 

environment case involving harassment by a supervisor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you were going to 

answer Justice Souter with the assertion that if indeed 

the Court wants employers to conduct these 

investigations, it does not want to reduce the incentive 

to do so.

 And the rule that is urged by the other side 

means whenever the -- whenever the employer conducts 

such an investigation, any employee who is smart enough 

to come in and testify against -- against sexual 

harassment has a guaranteed job. It is almost like --

almost like being a Federal judge.

 [Laughter.]

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't be fired after 

that, or the employer can't fire her without opening 

himself up to a lawsuit under -- under this provision. 

And he might win the lawsuit, but it's going to cost 

money. So why -- maybe an employer would rather say,

you know, I'd rather roll the dice and -- and not 

conduct an investigation and insulate all of my hostile 

employees from -- from employment actions.

 MR. YOUNG: That would be the -- that would 

be the employer's interest. The disincentive that the 

employers would have to comply with these -- with this 

Court's directives or strong suggestions in Faragher and 

Ellerth is employers would stop conducting these 

investigations if everyone they interviewed was going to 

be a potential retaliation claim.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And instead they would 

substitute the -- the response to an EEOC investigation 

in which they would not have the leg to stand on in 

opposing respondeat superior. I suppose that would be 

an inducement for them to go ahead with the 

investigation; wouldn't you?

 MR. YOUNG: Their -- they would lose the 

protections of Faragher and Ellerth. We would be back 

to respondeat superior liability. It sounds illogical, 

but I -- I submit to the Court that if -- that if it is 

going to be a Hobson's choice and it -- it would be a 

situation in which employers would have an incentive to 

choose not to -- would choose to abandon their policies 

and take their chances.

in a retaliation -- in a sexual harassment case, there's 

20 potential plaintiffs because they all participated. 

It doesn't even matter if the employer knows what the 

employees said. If -- if some type of discipline or 

adverse action is imposed by the employer on any of 

those employees, there is an instant retaliation claim.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: By the way, I take it in --

in this case, although this is not the issue before us, 

that if you -- if you lose on the issues before us, it 

is still your position that ultimately you should win 

this case, because you have good evidence, you say in 

your briefs, to indicate that the reason for firing had 

nothing to do with retaliation.

 That's true, isn't it?

 MR. YOUNG: I have two arguments left in my 

quiver on summary judgment, Your Honor, that the trial 

court didn't even consider. So if this case goes back 

down, that's what I'm going to ask the trial court to 

consider.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What are the other 

arguments on summary judgment.

 MR. YOUNG: The lack of causation, the lack 

of knowledge between whatever told the investigator in 

this confidential interview as to which confidentiality 

was promised and delivered, the lack of any knowledge --

-- the lack of any evidence that the decision-makers 

regarding Ms. Crawford and her job, that they knew what 

she said in this interview. The lack of causation is my 

first ground and the lack of pretext is my second ground 

that has yet to be considered. Because of the abundant 

evidence of misconduct which was discovered regarding 

how Ms. Crawford was not running her office.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say it's not 

that the employer is stuck because there's a potential 

retaliation claim, if the employer is certain of its 

grounds, that this discharge had nothing to do with her 

testimony, then go ahead and discharge her.

 MR. YOUNG: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you get your litigation 

fees if you win? If the plaintiff here loses, does she 

pay all the attorneys' fees that this employer has 

incurred on this litigation?

 MR. YOUNG: It is very difficult for a 

victorious defendant to recover attorneys' fees under 

section 1988, Your Honor. The threshold is very high. 

I've never recovered the fees in my 14 years working for 

this office in a section 1983 case.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So even when you win you 

lose.

Honor. Or a Title VII case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: On the other side, that 

attorney, there's a large disincentive. He hasn't got a 

good case. He's not going to be paid any retainer as 

you might be. And he's not going to get any counsel 

fees. Why should such -- why should it -- counsel be 

available to a person who obviously was discharged for 

having her hand in the till and not because she was 

harassed?

 MR. YOUNG: First of all, there is no 

allegation that Ms. Crawford embezzled or took money. 

There is no allegation, and she was not disciplined. 

She was not discharged based on any allegation she was 

stealing money. That's simply not a factor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. I meant that as a 

hypothetical.

 MR. YOUNG: Oh, I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the reason that 

she was -- what was the employer's reason for 

discharging her?

 MR. YOUNG: Multiple -- she was the payroll 

coordinator and her office -- all these checks were 

sitting in her office and they were not being processed. 

Some of them were six, eight, ten months old. Her 

office was in complete disarray. And this came to light

as a result of this sexual harassment investigation when 

her subordinates were interviewed and they provided 

testimony regarding how she was running her office, and 

that eventually got to the finance department of the 

government, which hired an outside auditor which went in 

and generated all this evidence at great expense to the 

metropolitan government to hire this outside auditor.

 That's where the evidence was developed to 

terminate Ms. Crawford six months after the statement to 

the investigators. So that's -- those were the facts on 

how it happened.

 I forgot Your Honor's original question, or 

maybe I answered it. I don't know.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I said if you have a 

really strong case of having discharged this person for 

cause that has nothing at all to do with harassment, you 

are going to win the lawsuit and it would be hard for 

the plaintiff to get a decent lawyer to represent her 

side of the case because she's going to lose.

 MR. YOUNG: In theory, yes; but the burdens 

of litigation, which is part of the congressional 

compromise -- back in 1964 in order to gain passage of 

the Civil Rights Act, employer's interests were deemed 

to be of equal magnitude as employees'.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't have to answer 

that. We'll be glad to see you again.

 MR. YOUNG: I hope I'm not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: My point is simply 

that the incentive system is skewed because if you lose 

you pay not only your attorneys' fees but the 

complainants'. If you win, you have to incur yours.

 MR. YOUNG: In civil rights cases the 

incentives, that incentive fee, that incentive system, 

is skewed against the defendants because of the public 

policy reason favoring --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not saying it 

shouldn't be. But in terms of the pressures towards 

settlement, it is a very strong incentive.

 MR. YOUNG: Yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Is bringing frivolous 

cases cost-free for the plaintiffs? There are certain 

costs.

 MR. YOUNG: Well, Your Honor, many of these 

types of cases are taken on a contingent fee basis

except for hard costs.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It is a mix. I mean, you 

know, a lot of plaintiffs might be afraid to bring these 

cases because they'll be accused of doing all kinds of 

bad things. They don't want their reputations ruined. 

They have lawyers who take contingent fees because they 

have to pay for it. Oh the other hand, you have 

problems with your costs and you have problems 

dismissing people who should be dismissed. Everybody 

has problems in this area. That's why we have law and 

lawyers. They try to minimize it. This doesn't seem 

fruitful to me.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't it true that 

financially it is always cost-free for the plaintiff 

because she has an attorney who is taking it on a 

contingent basis? Now, you could say it's not cost-free 

to the lawyer; but even that's not always true because 

if the lawyer has nothing else to do he may as well be 

doing this, you know, whatever the odds are.

 MR. YOUNG: I agree with that, Your Honor.

 And if the Court has no more questions, 

thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SCHNAPPER: Thank you, Your Honor, may 

it please the Court:

 Protecting witnesses from being fired 

because they provide information in internal 

investigates is not going to interfere with the conduct 

of those investigations or deter them. We know that 

from experience. Until the decision in this case, no 

one had questioned the applicability of the opposition 

clause to a witness in an investigation who complains 

about sexual harassment. It was simply not in dispute. 

The compliance manual in this regard was entirely clear 

since 2000 because the Commission took the position 

witnesses who complained were protected by the 

opposition clause. None of the problems Mr. Young 

expressed concern about had happened.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, Ms. Blatt 

said the government would prefer a decision under the 

opposition ground as opposed to the participation. Do 

you have a preference?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think she said she thought 

it was easier. We don't have a preference. But I'd 

like to address briefly the participation clause. The 

participation clause does have the singular value, as

Justice Alito suggested, that it is evenhanded, that it 

will protect witnesses for both sides. And the 

integrity of the process is certainly strengthened if 

both witnesses, witnesses on both sides, know they're 

protected from retaliation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the only question --

-the participation is not in doubt. The only question 

is whether it's an investigation under this subtitle.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: But the question is under 

this title. That language its certainly broad enough, 

as Justice Souter suggested, to encompass the sort of 

process that's at issue here. As Justice Ginsburg 

pointed out, this Court's decisions in Faragher 

virtually mandate these decisions.

 In response to the Chief Justice's point --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You think the language 

"investigation under this title" is the equivalent of 

"investigation with respect to an alleged offense under 

this title"? That doesn't strike me as self-evident at 

all. It seems to me "investigation under this title" to 

me means an investigation under this title, which is not 

an investigation by the employer.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: I think the words under this 

title are elastic enough to support either meaning. The 

context of the statute and the way this Court has

repeatedly construed it give meaning to it. In response 

to the concern that the Chief Justice raised, Faragher 

and Ellerth are not the only decisions that provide an 

incentive for these investigations. The Court's 

decision in Kolstad makes the existence of this sort of 

process essential to avoid awards of punitive damages. 

So even in non-harassment cases that same incentive has 

been created by the courts.

 In a situation involving harassment, the 

contours of the investigation are fact largely shaped by 

Federal law, not only policy guidance which the EEOC has 

issued helping employers figure out what to do, but a 

large and growing body of case law under Faragher and 

Ellerth elucidating what those requirements are. 

Particularly importantly here, the victims of sexual 

harassment are virtually required by the court to use 

these processes. Ms. Crawford had to speak up at some 

point or she had had no claim.

 And last, as a practical matter, if sexual 

harassment is going to be stopped, it's mostly going to 

happen through these internal processes. By the time 

most of these controversies about sexual harassment get

driven from her job. In Faragher and Ellerth and 

Harris, those had quit. If you look at the array of 

lower court decisions involving sexual harassment, by 

the time a case gets to the Commission in most of those 

cases the victim has give up and left.

 So it's exceptionally important that these 

processes be effective and evenhanded.

 No further questions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 1:59 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
