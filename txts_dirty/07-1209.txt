 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 07-1209, Peake v. 

Sanders et al.

 Mr. Miller.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court.

 Congress has directed the Veterans Court to 

take due account of the rule of prejudicial error in 

reviewing administrative determinations of veterans 

benefits. For four reasons, the court of appeals erred 

in holding that the Veterans Court should presume the 

existence of prejudice whenever it finds that the VA has 

erred in providing notice to the claimant.

 First, section 7261, the Veterans Court 

prejudicial errors statute, is in language that is 

essentially identical to that of the APA's prejudicial 

error provision. And when Congress adopted that 

language in 1988, it was understood to place upon the 

party challenging an agency's action the burden of 

showing that any error was prejudicial.

 Second, a notice error of the kind at issue

here does not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say that? That 

it was understood so? Because of the Attorney General's 

commentary on that?

 MR. MILLER: The principal reason that it 

was understood is because the uniform practice in the 

courts of appeals as of 1988 was to place upon 

challengers to agency action the burden of showing 

prejudice from the error. And the Congress was well 

aware of that, and in particular the Senate Veterans 

Affairs Committee was cited in the Ninth Circuit's 

decision in Seine & Line Fishermen's Union.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You basically have 

four cases in the courts of appeals to support that 

proposition, right?

 MR. MILLER: Well, Your Honor, it's 

considerably more than that. And the only cases that 

could even suggest any support to the contrary rule are 

in the very different context of notice and comment 

rulemaking under section 553.

 And the reason that that's different is 

really for two reasons. That is that the -- the 

interest that section 553 is intended to protect is not 

the interest of any particular commenter or particular 

outcome of the rulemaking. It's the interest of the

public in having the agency's decisionmaking fully 

informed by all of the relevant comments.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but this is --

I mean, it's kind of the -- it's the first notice.  It 

gets the ball rolling. I think it's like, you know, two 

teams and you don't tell one of the teams when the game 

starts and then you say, well, it doesn't matter because 

they would have lost anyway, there is no prejudice.

 MR. MILLER: The reason that in a great many 

cases there is not going to be prejudicial error of the 

kind at issue here is that the VA has an informal 

non-adversarial system and many opportunities to correct 

the effect of any official notice error. That is 

illustrated by the history of the cases. To take the 

Ms. Simmons's case, for example --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can we go back to the 

question that was just posed? We have never held that 

every agency -- agencies come in many sizes and shapes, 

but in all cases, the APA places the burden on the -- on 

the petitioner. But this Court has never held that 

across the board, no matter what agency we are talking 

about, that's the rule.

 MR. MILLER: That's correct. This Court has 

not held that. But Congress was aware that the uniform 

practice, certainly in agency adjudications in the

courts of appeals, was to place the burden on the 

challenger, and Congress --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Was Congress aware of this 

when the Administrative Procedure Act was passed, you 

mean?

 MR. MILLER: No, the statute at issue here 

is the Veterans Judicial Review Act of 1988. So the 

relevant time we are looking at what the practice was is 

as of 1988 when Congress incorporated the language from 

the APA and placed it into section 7261. And as of 

1988, it was clear that the burden was on the 

challengers.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Can I ask you to clarify 

exactly what you mean by the "burden" of showing 

prejudice? Is it correct that neither of the following 

-- to borrow the terminology that you would use in 

formal litigation, and I understand this is not formal 

litigation before an agency, but to borrow that 

terminology, is it correct that the issue here doesn't 

concern either the burden of production or the risk of 

nonpersuasion before the administrative agency? Before 

the regional office? In other words, if there's -- if 

there is evidence that the veteran as opposed to the VA 

has to produce, that doesn't change, and whatever the 

standard is that has to be met to show an entitlement to

benefits, that doesn't change either, so that all that's 

involved here is whether -- whatever showing needs to be 

made is to be made on appeal or on remand?

 MR. MILLER: That's correct. If we are 

talking about what showing needs to be made on appeal. 

And as this Court suggested in O'Neal, you know, the 

burden language is perhaps more appropriate for the 

context where there's people presenting competing 

evidentiary submissions to a factfinder and that's not 

what we have here.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's in O'Neal. It says 

that, but most of the court joined and the reason it 

says it is it just confuses everybody, at least me, to 

talk about "burden" in this context. I think if O'Neal 

is right, it says what this is, is not involving a jury, 

not involving -- it's just what Justice Alito says, and 

following that, what you have, you say to the judge, 

"Judge, your job is to decide this. Decide. Decide 

whether you think that the one side -- whether there is 

error or whether the error is harmless or whether it 

isn't. Decide it."

 Now, it could be in a rare instance the 

judge just can't decide. He's in grave doubt. And so 

what we are talking about is what to do in that -- what 

should be a very, very rare instance.

Now, when I read this case, I thought the 

Veterans Affairs is absolutely common sense on this. It 

says, well, when you really don't know what to do, 

Judge, if the veteran got no notice at all, then 

probably the error was harmful. But if he got the basic 

notice, and all that's at issue is who should produce 

what or whether he thinks that he didn't know that he's 

supposed to produce a lot of information, well, there, 

it would be pretty rare that it was harmful. So then 

you'd better say to him, veteran, why did this hurt you?

 That's all common sense, and it seemed to me 

that that's what the Veterans Court was saying and then 

the Federal Circuit unfortunately, like I might have 

done, too, got it all mixed up with this burden of proof 

language. Now, you tell me, legally is that result 

which I am talking about sensible, and if so, how do I 

get there legally?

 MR. MILLER: Justice Breyer, the reason that 

we have used the language of "burden" --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not criticizing you for 

that. I'm not -- it's not a criticism. I'm just really 

trying to figure out to get to what I see as common 

sense legally.

 MR. MILLER: The point that we are trying to 

emphasize is that, in the ordinary course the Veterans

Court, like any court, is going to act on the basis of 

arguments that are presented to it by the parties. So 

when you speak of the "burden," you mean the challenger 

has the obligation, if it wants the Veterans Court to 

find prejudice -- to articulate some theory of how there 

was prejudice. And that --

JUSTICE BREYER: The theory is he didn't 

know anything about this, got no notice whatsoever, so 

he didn't know that he's supposed to produce more 

information or he'll lose. That's the theory.

 MR. MILLER: But in order to -- in order to 

connect that error -- I mean, that's an identification 

of an error under the Veterans Claims Assistance Act. 

But if you connect error --

JUSTICE BREYER: But if you connect it by 

saying normally a veteran who isn't that knowledgeable 

-- not everybody is a genius in law -- when he doesn't 

get a notice that tells him you got to produce something 

more or you lose, he might forget to produce something 

more. That's the theory.

 MR. MILLER: If he has something more. And 

what we are saying is that in order to get a remand, the 

claimant, by the time they get to the Veterans Court, 

has already identified the error, has made an argument 

to explain to the court that there was in fact an error,

at that point they ought to explain how the error 

affected them. If it prevented them from put in a piece 

of evidence, they ought to tell the court, "Here's the 

piece of evidence that I want to put in."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, usually, when 

you have an appellate court, with a hard question, is 

easily divided, the case is resolved on the basis of the 

standard of review. What is the presumption, if it's a 

close case? And why isn't that all sort of what we are 

talking about here? It's a close case, and the judge --

the panel says, well, this side has the burden of 

persuasion, so we're going to come out the other way.

 MR. MILLER: Because I think in a case where 

the -- like these, where plaintiff has not identified 

anything that they would have done differently, it isn't 

a close case with respect to the question.

 Now, we have to be clear: If a claimant can 

articulate something they would have done differently, 

we are not saying they have the obligation of showing 

that the outcome definitely would have been different or 

more likely than not, it would have been different. It 

would be sufficient to identify what they would have 

done differently.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what if what 

they would have done differently is get different

medical tests, or done something like that, or have the 

doctor in the prior testing who prepared the diagnosis 

look at something that they didn't have them look at 

before? In other words, it's not simply the absence of 

documents that they know they can submit or could have 

submitted. It's that type of question where nobody 

knows. I mean, you don't know what would have happened 

if they had the doctor look at the issue that now turns 

out to be critical, but if they had gotten the right 

notice they might have had time to do that.

 MR. MILLER: Well, depending on the state of 

the record in a particular case, that might be 

sufficient to show a reasonable probability that the 

outcome would have been different. But in a lot of 

cases it won't be, and I think Simmons's case is a good 

example of that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if the government has 

the obligation at the very first to tell the veteran 

what the veteran must produce to substantiate the claim 

and the government doesn't do that, why shouldn't it be 

the responsibility of the government to say to the 

court, "this is what, if we had done what we were 

supposed to do, this is what we would have included in 

our notice." And looking at that, the court can tell 

whether there's anything the veteran might have done.

But why shouldn't the government at least have the 

obligation to say what it would have done had it 

complied with the statute, what it would have said 

specifically in this case?

 MR. MILLER: Well, I mean, how does the 

government comply, to take Simmons's case as an example, 

when the VA sent her the notice letter, her claim was 

for an increased rating. She had a hearing loss that 

had already been determined to be service-connected, but 

was not sufficiently severe to be compensable, and she 

said: My hearing has gotten worse and it now is 

severely worse to be a compensable disability. The 

notice letter that was sent to her, which is on page 43 

of the joint appendix, was incorrect and simply 

described the general requirements for establishing a 

service connection. It didn't specifically say to make 

out an increased rating claim you have to show that your 

hearing has become worse.

 But as soon as she got a decision from the 

regional office, which is the first decisionmaker in the 

VA system, she was told that the reason her claim had 

been denied was because her hearing loss was not 

sufficiently severe. And there's a mechanical 

application of the certain number of decibels in each 

ear yields a certain disability rating, and the notice

that she got from the regional office explained all of 

that and cited the regulation that we produced in the 

tables.

 So at that point she was aware of why her 

claim had been denied and what was missing, namely, 

evidence that her hearing had become worse. And she had 

been given at that point a series of hearing 

examinations -- examinations for hearing by VA doctors 

and the results of those were all reproduced in the 

decision that she got. And yet, the Veterans Court 

found that the government had failed to carry its burden 

of showing a lack of prejudice, because we couldn't show 

as a matter of law that there was no way she could 

obtain --

JUSTICE BREYER: Which is fine. If I get 

that record and if it is the way you describe, I'm not 

in grave doubt. No problem. The record's the way you 

described it, she knew everything she was supposed to 

know, so there's no harmful error, okay? We are only 

talking about cases where there is real doubt in the 

judge's mind about whether this failure of the agency 

did or did not hurt the woman or man. Now, when in 

doubt, we have the Veterans Court telling us the best 

way to administer this stuff is when they get no notice 

at all, and you are really in doubt, judge, you don't

know if it was harmful or not, here's what you do: 

Assume it was harmful. They're the ones who know. I 

don't know.

 MR. MILLER: With respect, Your Honor, I 

don't think that's a fair description of the effect of 

the rule adopted by the court below.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose then we look at our 

rule, we read the first paragraph, what this court said, 

and we all held it, and therefore, we say, those are the 

cases we're talking about, where you are in doubt, and 

when you are in doubt, go proceed as the Veterans Court 

told you in terms of who has to show what.

 MR. MILLER: I think this case is a good 

illustration about why that sort of grave doubt you are 

describing doesn't arise in a case like this, where at 

no state in the proceedings has the claimant offered 

anything that they would have done any differently. If 

they can't say, you know, here's what would have 

happened differently, than there really isn't any doubt 

what will happen on the remand, because if on the remand 

if they don't do anything different then the result is 

not going to be any different.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe I am not following 

this as I should, but it seems to me you are suggesting 

that there is no error.

MR. MILLER: No, certainly there was an 

error. There was an error.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What was the error?

 MR. MILLER: The error was that the initial 

letter that was sent to her describing what the evidence 

needed to -- that she needed to submit in order to 

establish her claim, misidentified that evidence; that 

it described the elements of general claim for service 

connectiveness, didn't specifically explain what was 

needed just an increased rating claim.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Are you saying that error 

was not prejudicial because the earlier information she 

received gave her what she needed?

 MR. MILLER: The principal reason why that 

error was not prejudicial is because the only way she 

could have received benefits for an increased rating 

claim was evidence that her hearing had become worse. 

And she had a VA hearing test that said her hearing did 

not meet the schedule A criteria for being compensable 

damages.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Why wasn't that statement 

you just made sufficient to discharge the burden of 

showing no prejudice?

 MR. MILLER: The fact -- I -- we believe it 

shouldn't, then. But under the rule as imposed by the

courts below, it clearly wasn't.

 Under the decision of the Federal Circuit, 

the VA has the burden of showing that there was no way 

that benefits could have been awarded as a matter of 

law. And that had been in effect prior to the VA 

proving negative by demonstrating the non-existence of 

any evidence anywhere that might have been material to 

the claim.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know -- it's 

easy to look back and view this in the abstract legal 

terms, but we are dealing with lay people who are trying 

to get something from the government, which is always a 

difficult thing. And you have one notice saying you 

have got to show that this was during the service, then 

they get another notice or decision saying it wasn't 

severe enough. Why is it so difficult, when the 

government made a mistake in dealing with this layperson 

who is just trying to get benefits to which they are 

entitled, to say that the government has to show that it 

didn't make any difference, rather than requiring the 

layperson to do that?

 MR. MILLER: Well, because there are two 

responses. The first is that it's important to keep in 

mind the stage of the proceedings which this inquiry 

involved. The prejudicial inquiry is only at issue once

the claimant has reached the Veterans Court, which is an 

adversary proceeding in which claimants do have counsel, 

and they identified an error and they have explained to 

the court: Here's what the error was. So that's the 

stage in which it would be incumbent upon them to 

articulate how the error might have affected them.

 The other point to be made is under the rule 

of the court of appeals it's going to be very, very 

difficult in many cases for the government to discharge 

the burden of showing there is no evidence that could 

have possibly been produced. And the result is a large 

number of remands.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And as between the two 

courts, the court of appeals, the Veterans Court and the 

Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, do we owe 

either of them, maybe not deference in the Chevron 

sense, but some deference because of their expertise in 

dealing with these claims, and if that is so then do we 

owe more deference to the court of appeals or the 

Veterans Court?

 THE WITNESS: I'm not aware that this Court 

has ever --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean it's an issue of 

law, so I take it it's de novo.

 MR. MILLER: It's certainly that.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in the exercise of 

that review, don't we have to give some weight to the 

determination of the Court of Appeals for Veterans 

Claims that sees these claims all the time? I actually 

thought that that's where you were going to start out 

because you cited 7261, which says that the Court of 

Appeals for the Federal Claims shall, what, give due 

effect to -- take due account of the rule of prejudicial 

error. And I think you could get from that that they 

have a certain amount of latitude in determining what 

the best rule is. But you're not going to -- you don't 

tell us that?

 MR. MILLER: No, and I think that by 

adopting language from the APA using the same language 

that applies to all kinds of judicial review of agency 

actions, Congress strongly suggested that it didn't want 

a unique rule for judicial review of VA determinations. 

And so I think there is no reason to defer to either the 

Veterans Court or the Federal Circuit on this general 

question of the standard of prejudicial review.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask a factual 

question. You said most of these people were 

represented by counsel. There used to be a rule that 

they could only be paid ten dollars a case. Is that 

still in effect?

MR. MILLER: When I said they were 

represented by counsel, I meant in the Court of appeals 

for Veterans Claims, not at the administrative --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But not during the nisi 

prius proceeding.

 MR. MILLER: In the administrative 

proceeding the restrictions on payment of counsel have 

now been relaxed at the Court of Veterans Appeals stage. 

So there generally -- there is not counsel at the 

regional office, but once the case reaches the board 

there can be counsel.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: There can be counsel. But 

is it really typical?

 MR. MILLER: I don't know the statistics on 

that, because --

JUSTICE STEVENS: There would be a dramatic 

change, because years ago I remember a case in which the 

Court upheld a ten-dollar fee limit on the notion that 

these people didn't need lawyers at all, which struck me 

as a little strange.

 MR. MILLER: In any event, that is no longer 

the case at the board level, and even those claimants 

who do not have counsel, the great majority of them, I 

think about three-quarters at the regional office level 

and 98 percent at the board level are represented by

some sort of non-attorney representative, either service 

organizations like the American Legion, or many States 

have organizations that assist claimants. Like Ms. 

Simmons, for example, was represented by a North 

Carolina State agency before the VA. So there is some 

assistance to claimants there.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Miller, could you help 

me out on how the system works in practice in a 

different way? One of your answers a few moments ago 

was that when -- I think it was Ms. Simmons was told why 

she lost, she in effect got as much notice as she would 

have needed to have to in effect do better on a remand. 

My first question is: Is there an automatic right to a 

remand?

 MR. MILLER: If you are talking about after 

the initial decision from the regional office, there is 

not an automatic right to a remand, but there is an 

automatic right to a de novo review by a more senior 

official at the regional office.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: With new evidence?

 MR. MILLER: Yes. You can get a hearing. 

You can present new evidence. It's a decision review 

officer. And then if you are still dissatisfied with 

the resolution after that, you can go to the board, and 

you can get a hearing before the board. The board's

review is de novo.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But even on the --

on the functioning of the system as you have explained 

it, at the -- at the very least the person says -- let's 

assume Simmons says: Oh, now I understand and I will 

get the following piece of evidence, which I didn't 

realize was my responsibility.

 Even on that explanation, it means that the 

claimant is going to have to go through another stage in 

the administrative litigation process.

 So I assume that ought to count as some sort 

of prejudice, and I assume it's something that, as it 

were, the burden of championing the VA ought to bear 

rather than the claimant.

 MR. MILLER: Well, I guess to the extent 

that the delay in adjudicating the claim is a kind of 

prejudice, it's not a prejudice that would in any sense 

be cured by a remand for further proceedings, which will 

just result in further delay.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If the -- I'm sorry. I 

didn't mean to interrupt.

 MR. MILLER: I would just add that the --

the effective date of the claim, which is the date as of 

which benefits are awarded, is the date the claim was 

filed, so you wouldn't be losing money when you --

except for the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you are going to 

have to go through another stage of litigation. One of 

the functions of the burden rule, and it might be too 

subtle a function to worry much about, but one of the 

functions is to puts the party with the burden on -- on 

notice that if you fail in your obligation, you're the 

one who is going to have to pay, unless you can convince 

everybody that there was in fact no harm done by this. 

And this induces the party with the burden to do what 

the primary obligation says the party ought to do.

 And on your -- and on your analysis, since 

the government would not have that obligation, the 

government has less of an inducement to follow the 

statutory obligation.

 MR. MILLER: But the government has a very 

strong inducement to follow the statutory obligation. 

Like every agency -- -

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it may have a strong 

inducement, but I'm talking about a stronger one. If 

the government knows that it is going to bear the burden 

of any doubt about the significance of its failure, to 

some extent I suppose that is going to induce the 

government to be on its toes.

 MR. MILLER: Well, I suppose that is right,

but I think in a lot of cases -- the VA in all cases 

strives conscientiously to comply with its statutory 

obligations. The notice requirements as described in 

section 5103 are fairly vague. They -- the notice has 

to be tailored, at least to some extent, to the nature 

of the claim that's presented. And every time that the 

Veterans Court or the Federal Circuit elaborates on 

exactly what kind of notice is required, to the extent 

that the VA wasn't aware of that elaboration before, 

there are going to have to be remands in all those 

pending cases.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I mean that's the 

essential problem with common law adjudication. And 

there is not much we can do about that.

 MR. MILLER: But it's a problem that is 

particularly acute here, given the volume of claims that 

the VA has.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the experience? 

When the case is remanded, it goes back to the -- does 

it go back to the regional? Suppose the -- the veteran 

is now given an opportunity to present whatever 

additional substantiation.

 MR. MILLER: The claim, when remanded from 

the Court of appeals for Veterans Claims, goes back to 

the board. In most instances the board would then send

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT SIMMONS

 MR. MEADE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I would like to make three points. First, 

because notice is integral to the system that Congress 

designed, the VA's failure to provide notice is likely 

to prejudice the veteran.

 Second, it would be difficult for the 

veteran and comparatively easy for the government to 

carry a burden. It would be difficult for the veteran 

because under the government's rule the veteran would 

need to engage in a speculative exercise, identifying 

what evidence would have been developed had the veteran 

been notified and had he received the full assistance of 

the agency.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why is it a speculative 

enterprise? If you are correct, and the proper 

resolution in a case like this is a remand, let's say 

all the way back to the regional office, and if before

the regional office it's the veteran who will need to 

come forward with some evidence supporting the claim, 

why does it make sense to remand the case to the 

regional office if there is no possibility that when the 

case gets back there the veteran can come forward with 

medical evidence that's needed?

 MR. MEADE: Two reasons, Justice Alito: 

First, it's not clear even in the Veterans Court that 

the veteran will have notice of what's required, a point 

I would like to address.

 But, second, if it's remanded, the process 

will develop as it should have in the first place, 

because under the statutory scheme there is both the VA 

and the veteran, the informed veteran, who have joint 

duties and together during an interactive process they 

develop the evidence together. And during this 

interactive process, to answer to Justice Stevens's 

question, the veteran is prohibited from hiring a 

lawyer. Without having the most basic notice of what's 

required, the veteran cannot participate in this 

process. And the only way we can know how the process 

would really work would be to give the veteran the 

notice that he was entitled to in the first place and 

then allow the process to unfold as it should have.

situation -- and I think actually your co-Respondent's 

case illustrates this better than yours. But you have a 

situation where the record as it has developed contains 

some evidence that supports the veteran's position and 

some evidence that supports the position in favor of 

denial of benefits. The Veterans Administration all the 

way up through the process finds that the evidence 

contrary to the veteran's position is much stronger and 

denies the claim on that basis. The veteran says: I 

didn't get notice of what exactly I needed to prove.

 Now, if on remand to the regional office 

it's still going to be up to the veteran to come forward 

with medical evidence showing hearing loss or vision --

connecting the vision loss to something that happened in 

the service, why does it make sense to send it back if 

there's no possibility that the veteran is going to be 

able to do that when the case gets back?

 MR. MEADE: Well, the answer is, first of 

all, that we don't know how the process would unfold 

once the veteran has notice. Even if there is evidence 

in the record, we don't know what evidence would have 

been developed had the veteran had proper notice.

 In addition, veterans often are not --

I'm not sure I follow you on that point. Once he's got

up to the next level and finds what the notice should 

have told him, why can't he come up with it then?

 MR. MEADE: Well, for a few reasons. First 

of all --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You say it's a de novo, 

right, at this next level?

 MR. MEADE: First of all, it's unclear 

whether the veteran would even have notice even at that 

point. None of the other requirements that the agency's 

is required to give are the same as the notice 

requirement. However, if in appropriate cases they have 

given the actual notice by the time it reaches the 

Veterans Court, they can use that to rebut the 

prejudice. And that's what the Veterans Court said in 

Vasquez-Flores.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In your case did your 

client attend the initial hearing?

 MR. MEADE: There was a medical examination 

that she didn't attend. There was a question of where 

the notice was sent, and this is at 70a of the 

Petitioner's appendix. There was confusion. 

Apparently, notice was sent to the wrong address by the 

agency.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what's the first 

time that your client knew that this claim was going to

be processed at a particular time or the first time your 

client knew it had been denied? I just was never clear 

on the fact of what happened. If the notice was lost in 

the mail, so how did she know there was a hearing at 

all, or did she?

 MR. MEADE: She later informed the agency 

that she had changed her address. But even it appears 

that further notices were sent to the wrong address.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm just trying to -- it 

seems to me at the first hearing, if she in fact is 

there, they say, well, now you have to give us some 

notice. And then at that point -- or some 

documentation, and at that point, at the initial 

hearing, everybody knows who has to produce what.

 MR. MEADE: But there is not necessarily a 

hearing. It was a medical examination that was supposed 

to be scheduled that she didn't attend, partly because 

of confusion of where the notice was sent.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there usually an 

initial hearing?

 MR. MEADE: No. There's only a hearing if 

the veteran requests it.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay.

 MR. MEADE: There is no hearing unless the 

veteran requests it. So here we have a situation where

the veteran did not know what she needed to provide. 

She has two sets of claims, one for her left ear and one 

for her right ear. Neither claim was intuitive. And 

she couldn't figure out what she needed to do without he 

notice --

JUSTICE BREYER: And so, why not just say 

that? What's the big problem of saying, judge, and then 

you say just what you said? And then the judge again 

won't be in doubt any more. So there's no need for this 

case because, either -- either -- either the veteran's 

agency will say, look, I walked that veteran through the 

process, I walked him through the process, walking him 

through the process he was told everything he needed to 

know, and there is no real problem here. It's just a 

formality that he didn't get the notice. And if that's 

true, I'm not in any doubt, unless the veteran tells me 

that that's wrong, and here was something, okay?

 On the other hand, we have your case. Your 

case, she didn't go to the doctor. If she went to the 

doctor, maybe she would have found something out.

 Again, I have no doubt, there is harmful 

error. So this case is a theoretical law professor's 

case that is never going to come up, because there is 

never any doubt. Either the VA did walk him through it 

and it's no deal -- big deal, because she can't come up

with anything, or she can come up with something.

 MR. MEADE: I agree that burdens only matter 

in a handful of cases, but it makes sense to put the 

burden on the government for a number of reasons.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It certainly does because 

it makes sense to tell the government: Government, you 

have to come up with every possible conceivable factual 

scenario and prove there wasn't a man from Mars who came 

in, and -- you know, that doesn't make sense.

 MR. MEADE: But that's not what we ask for 

here. First of all, if the veteran actually received 

notice during this dialogue that the government 

describes, then the government can point to that as a 

way to disprove prejudice.

 Second of all, veterans are often 

vulnerable. They are often unrepresented in the 

Veterans Court. Under the latest statistics, 64 percent 

are unrepresented at the beginning of the Veterans 

Court, 24 percent at the conclusion of the Veterans 

Court. Many have psychological and mental disabilities 

like post-traumatic stress disorder. Twelve percent of 

those who currently receive disabilities receive 

benefits for PTSD.

 And it's not clear -- this is not lawyers; 

this is not doctors trying to receive benefits. This is

not just lay people. They are veterans who served the 

country --

JUSTICE BREYER: I know all this and why 

don't you just tell the judge that and say: Look at my 

client, judge, look at my client. My client obviously 

isn't going to understand what to do unless the client 

is told. And here my client wasn't told.

 I'm the judge, I'm not in any doubt, you're 

going to win, okay?

 So what I can't figure out is how to deal 

with this case, which as I said strikes me as a law 

professor's case that shouldn't make any difference in 

any real situation.

 MR. MEADE: The reason is that it's helpful 

to have presumptions to deal with the typical case where 

we have in our case a first element notice error. The 

question where the veteran does not even know what 

evidence he needs to put forward, in that case it makes 

sense because of the high likelihood of prejudice to 

have a general rule that the burden should be on the 

government and not on the veteran.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No court is going to 

accept as a showing of prejudice the idea that, here, 

look at my client as a layperson who didn't know what to 

do. That's not going to be adequate, is it?

MR. MEADE: I don't think it would be. 

That's why it makes sense to have a general presumption. 

In cases where the government can either show that the 

process worked as it should have or that the veteran 

actually received notice during the process, it can 

rebut that prejudice.

 In fact, in 2008 alone, the government has 

been able to do so. And it has done so at least a dozen 

times in a number of cases, rebutting the burden of 

prejudice that was established by the Veterans Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's wrong with 

Mr. Miller's response that at the very first level of 

review, you can start all over; and at that point you 

know precisely why your claim was denied?

 MR. MEADE: Well, again, there are various 

levels of review. But the notice to start that first 

level of appellate review does not necessarily give the 

veteran the notice that she is entitled to.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was my 

question. Is it -- is it -- I take it it's more than 

just a stamp saying "denied," right? There is some 

explanation in every case?

 MR. MEADE: Exactly. There is a statutory 

requirement that a statement of reasons needs to be 

provided, but the statement of reasons don't necessarily

correlate with the detailed requirements under the 

notice statute. Under Vasquez-Flores what the Veterans 

Court said was that the notice needs to be quite 

detailed and the denial letter in a particular case 

might not map on to those particular requirements.

 In October of this year, Congress went 

farther and said: We want these notice letters to be 

even more detailed. We want to give the veterans more 

notice, which shows that the Congress is concerned about 

these notice letters and wants to make it clear to the 

veteran what is required.

 Let me answer a point that Justice Alito 

raised before. We are not asking here for a presumption 

of benefits. All we are asking for is a remand so that 

the veteran can get notice and have the process proceed 

as it was meant to in the original circumstance.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Does the -- the notice 

can be given -- skipped entirely, as it was in Simmons 

case, or notice could be given but it's defective. It 

can be defective in a major way, it can leave out -- you 

said Congress recently required a more detailed notice. 

Do we treat all those like, as long as the notice 

doesn't measure up fully to their statutory requirement, 

then the veteran goes back to square one? And so, you 

wouldn't make any distinction between whether the notice

was not given at all, and the case where the notice was 

given, but it was incomplete?

 MR. MEADE: The question of whether the 

notice is okay or not, is a question for the Veterans 

Court, a factual finding.

 Generally, though, I would agree with you 

that either no notice or incomplete notice are the same 

and would trigger a first notice error. There would be 

cases, I suspect, where the notice was erroneous, but 

only on a technical ground, that the Veterans Court 

would not think of as being a first level notice error.

 One final point I would like to make, Your 

Honor, is that in passing the statute Congress made it 

clear that it wanted to assist all veterans, including 

those whose claims did not appear meritorious on their 

face, and it did so by overruling the decision in Morton 

v. West in the Veterans Court.

 That case has said that a veteran needs to 

meet a certain minimal threshold before receiving VA's 

assistance, that first the veteran needs to show that 

the claim is well grounded. Congress rejected that in 

passing the statute and said: Congress wants to help 

all veterans, including those whose claims don't seem 

meritorious on the face and including those who can't 

make a threshold requirement. And Congress specifically

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. LIPPMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT SANDERS

 MR. LIPPMAN: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice,

 Justice Br eyer, I would like to address one 

of the observations you made applying O'Neal and 

Kotteakos and the "grave doubt" standard.

 The problem here is that those standards 

assume a fully developed record. That's why it's not a 

perfect fit here because the very notice failure, the 

defective notice, prevents a fully developed record.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it seems -- what I 

was trying to get to, which I don't see how to quite get 

there -- it seems to me that if something really went 

wrong, if there -- there's no notice, that "veteran, you 

have to put in some material, or you are going to 

lose," if there is no notice of that, and he really

didn't get any notice during all this cooperative 

process, then I think the Veteran's Court is right. At 

that point I think it's fair to assume that he's hurt.

 But if he got the notice -- and there'll be 

a few cases where he had nothing to produce, but a lot 

of them he would have had something to produce. They 

know it, we don't know. The Veteran's Court knows. Now 

the other three matters -- who is supposed to produce 

what, and do you have general knowledge, can you produce 

whatever you want -- I would think it would be very rare 

that a veteran was hurt, if he knows the first, by not 

knowing the second, third and fourth.

 And therefore, I think he better come forth 

to explain in the brief, in the brief, why this matters. 

Now, that's what it seemed to me the Veterans Court set 

up. They know about it. They set that up. It's common 

sense. So, how do I get to a legal result that says 

just that? Or can I or should I?

 MR. LIPPMAN: I don't think you should, and 

if my case could be used as an example --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Your case is one where 

the veteran did get what they call the first level 

notice.

 MR. LIPPMAN: Correct.

implication of Justice Breyer's question is that your 

client would lose, because your client did get the first 

level notice and you say that that's not good enough.

 MR. LIPPMAN: That's correct. He did not 

get the second or third level of notices; that is, what 

the government said it will get and what he was required 

to get.

 This is the letter or part of the letter, 

critical part of the letter he got. It says: "We are 

making reasonable efforts to help you get private 

records or evidence necessary to support your claim." 

So he had every reason to assume that the -- that the VA 

would get the evidence that was necessary.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why doesn't this make sense 

in your case? I think this illustrates what is 

troubling to me about the Federal Circuit's decision, 

but maybe I am missing the point.

 Your client was denied benefits for failure 

to show a causal connection, to show that his vision 

loss is service-related. He provided evidence from two 

private ophthalmologists or optometrists providing very 

weak causes of -- evidence of causation. One said it 

was not inconceivable that this was the cause of it. He 

was examined by two VA doctors, who said it was more 

likely that this was caused by post-service infection

rather than by an explosion while he was in the service.

 Now if the case -- if the notice was 

defective, why does it not make sense to say to your 

client, show us that you can come up with some medical 

evidence that shows that this is service-related, 

something more than a doctor who says it's not 

inconceivable?

 Then it makes sense to remand it. But if 

you can't do it on appeal, what sense does it make to 

remand it, where the same failure to provide evidence is 

going to doom his claim?

 MR. LIPPMAN: Two answers to that, Your 

Honor.

 The first is, the government makes the 

proposition that all we need to do is offer an 

explanation. But in legal terms, that is a proffer on 

appeal, and that is every bit as evidential as the 

actual evidence itself. Now, if we -- if we are to have 

a whole practice of proffers, it opens up a Pandora's 

box. I mean, where -- where do you stop if you make an 

exception for extra-record evidence, when the statutes 

make it clear that the evidence or whatever you are 

using has to be before the agency.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why is that such a tough 

thing to do? It sounds like it's sort of -- is there

some law out there that stops you from saying in the 

brief in a paragraph that, we would just like you to 

know, Judge, that we had some evidence here, or we have 

some now that we want to present to them. That's all.

 And then if I see that, I would say, my 

goodness -- and you describe it in three sentences. Now 

what is -- the Constitution doesn't stop you from doing 

that, does it? What stops you from doing that?

 MR. LIPPMAN: The statutes stop you from 

doing that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: They stop you, but the 

Veterans Court said to do it. So -- and they are the 

one who know this area and they said you should have to 

do it.

 MR. LIPPMAN: But with all due respect, I 

think the Veterans Court got it wrong. I mean --

JUSTICE BREYER: Between me and the Veterans 

Court, as to who knows best how to work this system, 

it's ten to one it's not me.

 MR. LIPPMAN: Okay. Let's look at it this 

way. Let's take it outside the VCAA context. A veteran 

has a right to a hearing, an evidentiary hearing, upon 

request. Let's say he requests the hearing, and for 

whatever reason the VA doesn't schedule one. He loses 

that right even though he requests it. Are we then now

to have proffers on the court of appeals saying, well, I 

would have said this, I would have said this, I would 

have said --

JUSTICE BREYER: What they decided there is 

if there's no notice at all, no, you don't have to have 

a proffer, because it's up to the agency to do just what 

you want. But if it's one of these other three, far 

more technical things, which occur far more rarely, on 

that one, you better tell the judge in the brief how it 

makes a difference.

 That's their conclusion. What's wrong with 

that?

 MR. LIPPMAN: Well, there -- there is 

certainly no analysis to it. I mean, it's sort of an 

intuitive distinction and in my case, it doesn't work.

 And I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the -- the statute 

says, and this is consistent with Justice Breyer's line 

of questioning, that the Veterans Court, the Court of 

Appeals, the Veterans Court of Appeals, shall give due 

account to the notice -- to the rule of prejudicial 

error. That seems to me to indicate that it has some 

discretion in how to decide the harmless error rules 

that it will apply, and that it knows more about it, in 

Justice Breyer's term, than either we or the Court of

Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Why can't I get that 

out of this statute?

 MR. LIPPMAN: Well, I guess you would have 

to reconcile the more specific statute that deals with 

only able to submit evidence or any other material at 

the time -- at the of the agency's adjudication. In 

other words, I don't see that statute allowing 

post-agency adjudication proffers or even submitting 

evidence. I mean, just by the very line of your 

questioning, it seems to me that you find it 

interchangeable whether you assert it in your brief that 

this is what I would have done or whether you would have 

submitted the evidence itself. They are both 

evidential. And another problem, which is really --

JUSTICE ALITO: Your position seems to be 

not that the government should have to show prejudice, 

but as applied to a case like yours, that there is an 

irrebuttal presumption of prejudice. What could the 

government show? They would have to show that there is 

not a single ophthalmologist in the country who, if he 

or she examined Mr. Sanders, would find that the vision 

loss was attributable to a bazooka explosion in World 

War II?

 MR. LIPPMAN: No, Your Honor. The -- what 

the government must show is well set forth in the

Federal Circuit's opinion. It must show that the 

claimant had either actual knowledge of what he needed 

to submit; second, that he had some constructive 

knowledge, in other words a reasonable claimant would 

have had notice; or three, that the claim couldn't 

entitled to benefits as a matter of law.

 So that's the beauty --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- but I don't understand 

that. I mean, let's suppose, contrary to your wishes, 

that the client was not hurt. He was hurt by some other 

thing, nothing to do with the bazooka. That's not your 

client -- that's the imaginary client -- but everything 

else is the same.

 Well, does that mean because they forgot to 

tell the client that the client has to go and produce 

some evidence, and she thought the Veterans 

Administration would produce all the evidence? Because 

they forgot that, your client wins and gets the money?

 MR. LIPPMAN: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: That doesn't seem --

MR. LIPPMAN: -- he wouldn't get the money, 

okay? Because all -- we are talking about a remand, not

some evidence, don't you, or you lose?

 MR. LIPPMAN: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So then why is it a big 

deal that you summarize what you're going to produce in 

the brief? We're back where we started.

 MR. LIPPMAN: Let me answer it this way. 

Let's assume we do make proffers, as you suggest, at the 

Veterans --

JUSTICE BREYER: I might have called them a 

proffer. I just want to say it's a description in the 

brief of how you're hurt.

 MR. LIPPMAN: Well, in the legal sense I 

consider it the same thing. Maybe Your Honors don't, 

but I do. And -- let -- let's say he proffers or 

describes in his brief what medical evidence he needs to 

submit.

 How could he in good faith make a proffer 

and speculate on what the doctor -- let's say he is 

seeing a treating doctor. And on page 49 in the 

footnote, there is a discussion of what I'm going to 

explain to you now. But let's say he alleges, well, if 

I had gotten notice, I would have gone to my treating 

doctor, and I would have submitted questions and I would 

have submitted the claims file, but I can't know in good 

faith what the doctor would say. It's inherently

speculative. And that's one good policy reason, apart 

from the clear categorical language of the statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You started earlier, 

at one point, to say how this actually worked out in 

your case. Could you just spend a minute to explain 

that?

 MR. LIPPMAN: How --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How it makes a 

difference in your case.

 MR. LIPPMAN: Sure. It was a little unclear 

until a case -- if I may answer it this way, Your Honor.

 My -- the Board of Veterans Appeals decided 

there was only one medical evidence it would follow, and 

that was the 2000 VA exam. And that exam really denied 

the veteran because there was no corroborating medical 

evidence contemporary with his injury and the 

symptomology thereafter. If I could have it go back 

down, what I would do is try to find what we call "buddy 

statements," lay statements, that would corroborate that 

he had symptoms from time of service and well on, which 

under a case called Buchanan is sufficient evidence to 

base a finding of service connection.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why wasn't that 

enough for you to establish prejudice, regardless of who 

had the burden?

MR. LIPPMAN: To make that allegation at the 

court of appeal that I would have gotten this?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Uh-hmm.

 MR. LIPPMAN: Quite frankly, I don't know if 

I would have gotten it.  I mean, I would try.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you would 

phrase the prejudice in terms of what you would have 

done and what you weren't able to do, and which you can 

now go back and do if it's remanded. You don't have to 

have the evidence that three people would say he was 

complaining about the vision loss at the time. It just 

seems a reasonable thing to -- you know, maybe it is 

reasonable, maybe it's not; but the Veterans 

Administration has more knowledge about that.

 MR. LIPPMAN: Your Honor, in a way, the 

third prong of the Federal Circuit's analysis does that. 

It tells the government: Look, if the veteran could not 

prove his claim, no matter what the facts -- evidentiary 

development was, then the veteran loses.

 So really it's all contained in the third 

prong. And that's why the Federal Circuit's analysis in 

my opinion is so good. It's because it doesn't make you 

go outside of the record to reach these issues, and it 

allows the government a lot of room to prove that it's 

not worthwhile, this claim's not worthwhile to, remand.

I ask the Court to really carefully look at 

that because I know the Federal Circuit spent -- must 

have spent a lot of time in coming up with that 

analysis.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know where this 

first level, second level -- I'm looking at the statute 

on page 98a of the petition. And it seems to me all 

part of one. It is one notice? It doesn't seem to 

specify a second and a third. It's describing the 

contents.

 MR. LIPPMAN: Well --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: "As part of that notice, 

the Secretary shall indicate which portion of the 

information and evidence is to be provided by the 

claimant and which portion by the Secretary." The 

statute seems to be talking about one notice, not "first 

level," "second level."

 MR. LIPPMAN: Well, they haven't enumerated 

it, Your Honor, as such. But analytically it breaks 

down to that. But the fourth element, because it says, 

look, you'll have to tell the claimant what the 

contents, what you need. Then it says, well, what we 

are going to get for you, and then that's the second. 

And third one is what you have to get.

 The fourth one was engrafted upon it because

recall offhand the exact subdivision, Your Honor.

the Secretary requests the claimant provide any evidence 

in the claimant's possession that pertains to the claim.

straightforward.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MILLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 I would like to make just three points. 

First, on the question of what is provided to the 

claimant after the denial in the regional office. 

Before they get to the Board of Veterans Appeals, the 

regional office issued them a statement of the case, and 

that's described at 38 C.F.R. 19.29, and that regulation 

has fairly detailed requirements about what has to be in 

there in terms of a description of the evidence, the 

description of the applicable laws and regulations and 

analysis of the board's conclusions, or the regional 

office's conclusions and its application of the law to 

the evidence.

 The second point --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think it's 

perfectly clear from that what gaps need to be filled 

in?

 MR. MILLER: In many cases, it would be. 

But perhaps there would be some where it wouldn't, and 

of course in those cases if there can be some 

articulation of why it wasn't then we would agree --

JUSTICE SOUTER: At that point is the 

claimant disentitled to have a lawyer?

 MR. MILLER: No. Once they file the notice

of disagreement in the regional office and receive the 

statement of the case, they could then have a lawyer in 

the board.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But at the point they get 

the notice and they are trying to evaluate the 

significance of the notice, they are not entitled to a 

lawyer?

 MR. MILLER: If you are referring to the 

statement of the case, by the time they receive the 

statement of the case they are at the stage of the 

proceedings where they could get a lawyer.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what about the notice, 

the original notice? They don't have a lawyer at that 

point? That was Justice Souter's question. I didn't --

MR. MILLER: Oh, if you meant the original 

notice required by the statute. No.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No -- at the point where 

the statute requires original notice, they are not 

entitled to a lawyer.

 MR. MILLER: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: We agree on that. Now, 

they have gone through stage one of the litigation and 

they have lost. And they are getting a statement of 

reasons. At that point, are they entitled to have a

lawyer?

 MR. MILLER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But whether -- I guess the 

situation that I am concerned with is, the person up to 

that moment not only does not have, but is not entitled 

to have a lawyer. The person then gets a piece of paper 

in the mail that says, "You lost. These are the 

reasons." If the person -- if the claimant then says, 

"I don't know what they are talking about. I will go 

get a lawyer," then I can understand at that point a 

relatively sophisticated mind is going to come in to 

understand it. But if the client simply reads it and 

says, "I really don't know what they are talking about 

here or at least I think I know what they are talking 

about, and I guess it's hopeless," the person is not 

likely to have legal advice.

 And what I'm getting at is that the person 

at that stage, at the moment the notice arrives, is in a 

position, I would think, of extreme relative 

disadvantage.

 MR. MILLER: I think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You can see where I am 

going with the argument.

 MR. MILLER: Yes. The important point is 

that the only way the prejudicial error becomes an issue

and really the paradigmatic case that we are talking 

about is where the veteran does get counsel and has 

reached the Veterans Court and has identified the error 

in a way that's persuasive to the Veterans Court, but 

nonetheless identifies no additional evidence that they 

would have --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it seems to me that 

there are two points at which the veteran is at a 

disadvantage. And you are talking about the second of 

the two. I am talking about the first of the two. And 

the first of the two is the point at which the -- I 

mean, following the hearing, the veteran gets the notice 

and the veteran is not in a very sophisticated position 

to evaluate what the veteran is being told.

 MR. MILLER: Yes, and a claimant who in the 

Veterans Court can say, you know, "I didn't understand 

and as a result I failed to present the -- because of 

the defective notice and my lack of understanding of the 

statement of the case, I didn't present this important 

piece of evidence, and here's how it would have been 

material," in that case, they would be entitled to a 

remand. But a remand --

saying "entitled to a lawyer," do you mean entitled to a 

lawyer or allowed to have a lawyer?

claims.
