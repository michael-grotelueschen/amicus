 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in case 07-751, Pearson v. Callahan.

 Mr. Stirba.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER STIRBA,

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. STIRBA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 At the time of the arrest in this case there 

were three different Federal circuits and two State 

courts that established it was Constitutionally 

permissible for police officers to enter a home without 

a warrant as a follow-up entry to effectuate arrest 

after an illegal drug transaction when a government 

agent had occurred and probable cause had been 

established.

 Although the rule has become known as the 

doctrine of consent once removed, and the lower courts 

have banned various rationales in support of the rule, 

the name or label is not important. What is important 

is that the rule is predicated upon well recognized 

Fourth Amendment principles, and that at the time of the 

arrest the consent doctrine was well established in the 

lower courts as settled Fourth Amendment law.

Thus, irrespective of how this Court rules 

on the constitutionality of the rule itself, the 

Petitioner officers could have reasonably believed that 

what they were doing was lawful.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, because the 

Fourth Amendment principle of consent was well 

established? In other words, if a police officer goes 

to the door and says "May I come in," that is -- that is 

perfectly acceptable. Is that -- that the level of 

generality that you think we ought to analyze this issue 

at?

 MR. STIRBA: No, certainly we think that the 

generality of just pure consent is not the level at 

which it should be determined. In fact, that was the 

problem with the Tenth Circuit case. But it has to 

be -- the right has to be defined in a specific clear 

way, and it has to be -- the contours of the right have 

to be sufficiently clear that police officers know that 

when they engage in the conduct, they know what they 

they're doing is unlawful.

 In this case, Mr. Chief Justice, all of the 

law that was in existing at the time of the entry was 

supportive of exactly what the police officers did.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it seems to me that 

misses the point of the case. I mean, the point of the

case is that consent to the police was established, 

consent to police informants was not, and that when I 

consent I am not consenting to the -- to the whole 

world. If I am consenting to somebody who is not a 

police officer, that is not equivalent to consenting to 

a police officer.  That's the point of the case; and as 

I understand it, there was -- there was only one case at 

the time that this occurred which equated the 

confidential informant for the police with the police; 

and that was the Seventh Circuit case; isn't that 

correct?

 MR. STIRBA: Justice Souter, we are not --

we are not contending this is an implied consent case, 

although that has been a theory that has been advanced 

in the lower courts. We believe that the way that this 

was constitutionally lawful -- this is really a Lewis 

case, and that is once you engage in some illegal 

conduct with a government agent in your home, you have 

waived any expectation of privacy.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but that -- that 

equates -- in terms of existing law, that equates the 

government agent, which in this case is not a police 

officer, but a confidential informant, with a police 

officer. And it seems to me that is the nub of the 

case: Is that person equivalent, so that consent to one

in effect is consent to as many police as want to come 

in, or is it not the case? And it seems to me what you 

have got to argue here is that the confidential 

informant and the police officer for Fourth Amendment 

purposes should be treated as identical.

 MR. STIRBA: Absolutely. And we do -- and 

we think --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And there is no clear law 

on that. That's why we are here. There's one -- at the 

time that this search was made, as I understand it, 

there was only one case which held there was such an 

equivalence, is that correct?

 MR. STIRBA: There are two points, 

Justice Souter. First of all, with respect to the 

lawfulness of the confidential --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, first -- I want to 

hear what you say, but tell me, is it correct that at 

that time there was one case that held the equivalence?

 MR. STIRBA: No, Your Honor. There actually 

-- there were actually three out of the Seventh Circuit, 

the Pollard case out of the Sixth Circuit, which 

involved a police officer and a confidential informant 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Which was not a circuit 

case, right?

MR. STIRBA: That is a circuit case.


 JUSTICE SOUTER: District case?


 MR. STIRBA: That was a circuit court case,


U.S. v. Pollard.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So there were three circuit 

court holdings that the confidential informant was 

equivalent to a police officer?

 MR. STIRBA: There were three out of the 

Seventh Circuit. Paul, Diaz, and I think it's Aziano 

were all confidential information cases where the courts 

ruled squarely that there was no difference between a 

confidential informant and a police officer.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, did you -- now, do 

you have other circuits that held that?

 MR. STIRBA: Yes, Your Honor. The Pollard 

case involved a confidential informant --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Where is Pollard from?

 MR. STIRBA: Sixth Circuit.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Sixth.

 MR. STIRBA: And they cited in support the 

confidential informant cases from the Seventh Circuit. 

We also read Gramble -- this is a 2000 -- I'm sorry, a 

995 Ninth Circuit case which talked about a government 

agent, it did not draw a distinction between a 

confidential informant and a police officer -- as

supportive as well. That's exactly what Judge Kelly 

determined in the dissenting opinion in the Tenth 

Circuit.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Now why -- why are 

they correct? Why should the confidential informant be 

treated as equivalent to a police officer?

 MR. STIRBA: Well, fundamentally -- and of 

course the test for Fourth Amendments purposes is the 

Skinner test -- that once you are a government agent or 

a government actor, there really is no material 

difference in terms what the confidential informant 

would do or the undercover police officer would do.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Oh, but there is an 

enormous difference between the training and the 

character of a police officer and, as this very case 

illustrates, the confidential informants are often very 

shady characters who can't be counted on to be 

truth-tellers, and have a powerful incentive to get 

someone for the police, because in most cases they are 

seeking to have their own case dealt with 

sympathetically. So, how can you equate a police 

officer with a confidential informer, who is usually 

someone who knows where the drug house is because he's a 

dealer himself?

 MR. STIRBA: Two points. In our reply

brief, pages 6 and 7, we point out the wide variety of 

confidential informants. They come in many different 

shapes and sizes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about this one? 

Wasn't this one that fits my description, the one in 

this case?

 MR. STIRBA: This one clearly had a drug 

problem. This one also attended college. This one also 

was a star athlete in high school, and this one also was 

reliable in a previous drug transaction. Moreover --

JUSTICE SOUTER: He was trying -- and he was 

trying to make a deal to get leniency with the police.

 MR. STIRBA: Well, there is no question 

about that. But once again, he is a government actor. 

For purposes of Fourth Amendment liability it doesn't 

matter whether it's a police officer or a confidential 

informant, as long as he is an agent of the government, 

which clearly he was. He was a government actor --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you -- you certainly 

cannot argue -- maybe you are, but I don't see how can 

you argue in response to Justice Ginsburg that the 

integrity to be expected from a confidential informant, 

taking that as a category of law including all sorts of 

informants, is the integrity that we would expect in a 

police officer.

MR. STIRBA: Well, as a general proposition, 

Justice Souter, you can't make that kind of 

determination. We point out --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why can't I?

 MR. STIRBA: Because sometimes confidential 

informants are retired police officers; sometimes 

confidential informants are police cadets. Sometimes 

confidential informants --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then if that -- if that is 

true, as it clearly is, they run the gamut from the good 

to the bad. You can't make -- adopt the proposition 

categorically that confidential informants should be 

regarded as having the same integrity as a police 

officer.

 MR. STIRBA: I wouldn't want to make that 

statement. I don't know that it's material, though, to 

the analysis under the Fourth Amendment and whether or 

not, once you are a government agent or a government 

actor, there really is no legal significance that flows 

from that to draw a distinction between one who is 

actually employed by the police, taking a paycheck from 

the police, and one who is not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's one feature of 

this is that I think is really puzzling: What this case 

is about is the Fourth Amendment, that requires, with

certain exceptions, the main rule is to get a warrant. 

And here you have a confidential informer going to the 

place to make sure that they really do have the goods. 

Then he goes back to the police. He spends two hours. 

He's being wired and whatever else. Why didn't somebody 

pick up the phone and get a warrant at that point? The 

confidential informer could say: "I was there and I saw 

the drugs." What -- the whole purpose of these rules is 

to have the police get a warrant when they can. And how 

do you explain that two hours lapse between when they 

had probable cause and when the -- when the informant 

returns for the second time?

 MR. STIRBA: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the 

officers testified why they didn't get a warrant, 

244-245 in the joint appendix, and 256 and 257. Two 

problems: One, they weren't sure the drugs were going 

to be there. These are small amounts of drugs in a 

rural area; they dissipate very quickly.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: We're talking about 

probable cause. If they got a warrant within an hour or 

two of the time that that informant says he saw them 

there, do you seriously question whether there would be 

probable cause?

 MR. STIRBA: I am only going on the record 

and what these informed officers testified to.

JUSTICE SOUTER: But we're asking for the 

basis. You're asking for a rule and our questions go to 

the reason for having that rule. And the officers may 

have said -- and I will assume they said -- in this 

case: Oh, gee, we weren't sure the drugs would still be 

there. But in terms of probable cause law, that's just 

not a serious answer, is it?

 MR. STIRBA: Well, it is. In essence we are 

talking about an anticipatory warrant, and under U.S. v. 

Grubbs you not only need probable cause to believe that 

the drugs will be there --

JUSTICE SOUTER: They don't even need an 

anticipatory warrant. They need a warrant to go in and 

search that place on the grounds that there are probably 

drugs there, and if they saw drugs there a couple of 

hours beforehand and they had no affirmative evidence 

which they should bring forward under the Frank standard 

to indicate that the drugs were being taken out, is 

there any serious question that probable cause would be 

found?

 MR. STIRBA: Justice -- Justice Souter, I 

don't believe at the time, approximately 9 o'clock in 

the evening, the police had probable cause to believe 

the drugs were there.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: An informant just came out

and said there were drugs there and they don't have 

probable cause?

 MR. STIRBA: At the time of 9 o'clock, I 

don't think it was established that there were drugs --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why not?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought it was 

established not only that there were drugs, but that he 

actually tasted some.

 MR. STIRBA: He never told the police that. 

And the purpose --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But --

MR. STIRBA: The purpose of the operation, 

of course, was to establish that there was in fact drugs 

in the house. The transaction would occur and that 

would conclusively establish probable cause. I don't 

think we should fault the police for essentially being 

careful before they entered the home to make sure that 

in fact they had probable cause.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The reason the police are 

being faulted is that they didn't get a warrant. And 

the warrant requirement is a generally good starting 

place for a Fourth Amendment argument.

 Justice Ginsburg's point is that if they had 

an informant who had seen drugs in the place within two 

hours, they had, if they'd been before a magistrate, the

basis in probable cause to get a warrant. And I still 

haven't heard why in fact they couldn't have got one or 

why they didn't have the probable cause.

 MR. STIRBA: Well, as I -- as I explained 

before, they believed the drugs in --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not interested in what 

they personally believed. We're talking about objective 

Fourth Amendment standards. Did they or did they not 

have a basis to establish probable cause at that point?

 MR. STIRBA: We don't believe they did, Your 

Honor. And we don't believe they could have gotten a --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That is --

MR. STIRBA: -- an anticipatory warrant.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I will admit that is the 

most astonishing view of probable cause I have heard in 

this courtroom. Of course they had.

 MR. STIRBA: Well, the record evidence 

doesn't substantiate that, or they would have gotten --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why doesn't it?

 MR. STIRBA: Or they would have gotten a 

warrant.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why doesn't it? As I 

understand, the record evidence is that their informant 

was in that guy's home, and within two hours of the 

point that we went through, the second entry, he had

seen drugs. Why wasn't there probable cause within that 

two-hour period?

 MR. STIRBA: Because the police did not 

believe that at the time that they could have gotten a 

warrant, that the drugs would not have been dissipated. 

And they -- as they testified --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that a reasonable 

belief?

 MR. STIRBA: Pardon me?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, we're talking about 

probable cause, not an establishment of mathematical 

certainty.

 MR. STIRBA: Here's another point. That is 

just an option, Justice Souter, the police -- if you 

believed the police could get a warrant. They didn't 

have to get a warrant. They obviously were engaged in a 

buy/bust operation, which eventually led to them to the 

particular position where they clearly established 

probable cause.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They clearly would have 

been if they had sent a police officer in. You're 

asking us to extend the police officer rule to include a 

confidential informant rule. One reason for doing so 

is, or would be, that in practical terms there is a need 

for it. Justice Ginsburg's question was, why is there a

need for it, when they could have gotten a warrant? And 

we still haven't heard an answer.

 MR. STIRBA: In rural Utah -- and this is 

page 47 of the joint appendix -- the officers testified 

that one of the reasons why they need to use 

confidential informants is because the police are all 

known. And, therefore, if they're going to engage in 

any drug --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why didn't they use 

the confidential informant to get a warrant?

 MR. STIRBA: Well, I don't know how I can 

answer the question any more than I have, 

Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That doesn't --

MR. STIRBA: They -- they chose not to, for 

reasons they didn't believe they had probable cause and 

they were concerned that the drugs had been dissipated.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, in every --

given the posture of the ultimate issue in this case on 

the underlying constitutional question, you do not have 

to prove that you are right; isn't that correct? You 

have to establish that the contrary principle is not 

clearly established?

 MR. STIRBA: That's correct. And the law at 

the time that these officers engaged in this operation,

entered the home -- and once again, it was based upon 

probable cause -- supported in fact constitutionally 

what they did, and that it was indeed permissible. And 

that was the basis upon which we believe, irrespective 

of how the Court views whether they should or should not 

have gotten a warrant and the constitutional 

implications of that, that the law was clearly not 

established sufficiently such that these officers were 

entitled to qualified immunity. That was one of the 

problems with the Tenth Circuit case. They --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just establish one 

thing? Tell me if I am wrong. That this argument about 

consent once removed was not presented in the lower 

courts. That is, in the trial court you argued exigent 

circumstances, and then on appeal the inevitable 

discovery rule. So there was -- in the courts below, 

this was not given as the reason, the consent once 

removed was not alleged as the basis, as the 

justification for this search?

 MR. STIRBA: That's true. On the criminal 

appeal, the State did not argue Lewis, did not argue 

consent once removed. And that is part of the problem 

with a number of cases that have been cited by the 

Respondent. They are exigent circumstances cases where 

the consent once removed doctrine of Lewis isn't even

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. STEWART: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The police entry in this case was 

constitutional and, in any event, did not infringe any 

constitutional right that was clearly established at the 

time the officers acted. The mandatory order of 

decision for qualified immunity cases announced in 

Saucier v. Katz should be overruled.

 I did want to begin by clarifying the answer 

to your question, Justice Ginsburg, because I'm not sure 

if it was entirely clear. There were really two cases 

here, one of which was the criminal prosecution of Mr. 

Callahan, the Respondent in this Court. And the 

individual officers were not parties as to that case. 

That was handled by the State of Utah. And you're

correct that in the criminal proceeding the consent once 

removed argument was not made. And that led to the 

motion to suppress ultimately being granted and 

consequently Mr. Callahan was not subject to criminal 

proceedings.

 Mr. Callahan did file a civil suit against 

the individual officers who were involved in effecting 

the arrest, and in that civil proceeding the consent 

once removed argument was made all the way up. It was 

made in the district court, and it was made in the court 

of appeals as well.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Stewart, could I follow 

up on one other thing that came up during the preceding 

argument? Isn't the issue whether there was or was not 

probable cause quite separate from the consent once 

removed doctrine? What -- assuming that there was 

probable cause here, there may be many instances in 

which the consent once removed doctrine would be 

applied, if it's a valid doctrine, where there wasn't 

previously probable cause.

 MR. STEWART: That's correct. I think the 

consent once removed doctrine would have its greatest 

utility in cases where the police suspect but don't have 

probable cause to believe that a particular individual 

is engaged in criminal activity, and so they send an

informant or an undercover police officer in to try to 

either confirm or dispel their suspicions. They 

wouldn't be able to get a warrant at the outset because 

they would not have probable cause at that time of 

ongoing criminal conduct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if our question is 

should consent once removed be recognized as a doctrine 

that covers the confidential informant in this case, one 

question that we may sensibly ask is, is there a need to 

recognize that broad a consent doctrine? And one 

question that would bear on that would be, in these 

cases, is there difficulty or impossibility of getting a 

warrant under normal probable cause standards? And I 

think that was the point of Justice Ginsburg's question. 

Do you doubt that they could have gotten a warrant 

within the two-hour period?

 MR. STEWART: We certainly think that they 

had probable cause. There was testimony from police 

officers to the effect that magistrates in Utah would be 

reluctant to grant warrants based on these circumstances 

because of the possibility that the drugs would be 

dissipated. I am not in a position to second-guess 

their empirical experience as to the circumstances under 

which Utah magistrates will and will not grant warrants. 

But we think as a legal matter that there was probable

cause, and that a warrant should have been issued. But 

certainly there are -- there are plenty of 

circumstances --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- it's not just 

this case. Maybe you can tell me. I thought because 

they were dealing with a confidential informant rather 

than a police officer, they sent him in to do the dry 

run. I mean the -- in the police officer cases usually 

the -- the undercover police officer goes in. The other 

police officers are there ready to come in when he gives 

them the signal. But the police officers don't 

ordinarily go through this dry run that they had here 

with the confidential informer.

 MR. STEWART: Well, I -- I would think that 

with either police officers or with informants you could 

have some situations in which the undercover operative 

has very recently attempted to confirm the presence of 

drugs. And you can have other cases in which the 

undercover operative, again either an informant or a 

police officer, could hear rumors on the street that a 

particular individual was engaged in drug-dealing, might 

not have probable cause, and they might decide that the 

best way to set up the operation was to send this person 

in to attempt to make a buy at a time when probable 

cause was lacking. But they would want to arrange the

operation in such a way that if the operative's 

experience confirmed their suspicions and gave them 

probable cause to arrest, they would be able to go in 

immediately.

 And our principal contention is not that the 

consent to the entry of Bartholomew was implicit consent 

to the later entry of the police officers. It was that 

once a person has, even unknowingly, admitted a 

government agent into his home, his expectation of 

privacy is sharply reduced and the entry of the officers 

works an insubstantial incremental invasion of privacy.

 And I would like to return to the point that 

Mr. Stirba was making. It's true that the informant 

here lacked the training and skills that -- and 

integrity, for that matter, that you would expect a 

police officer to have. But he was for Fourth Amendment 

purposes a government agent a State actor. If his 

handlers had instructed him to look for an opportunity 

to rummage through the drawers --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Stewart, could I 

interrupt you, because there is something that hasn't 

been reached. Do you think that we should answer the 

constitutional question first or the immunity question 

first?

this case should address the constitutional question 

first because it is the subject of the square circuit 

conflict, it's been briefed and argued, it's a question 

that independently warrants resolution.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It is quite difficult. I 

mean there -- we don't know quite a lot about whether 

they would have gotten a warrant, how -- how dangerous 

it was, whether the drugs were likely to be hidden. And 

I was thinking of it, and that's why I am saying this, 

is that it's a perfect reason since constitutional 

questions in this area are -- are like the stars in the 

sky. There are so many. Rather than having the judges 

answer each one and getting everything mixed up, why not 

just have them take whatever is the easier path? As a 

judge I like to take what is the easier path.

 MR. STEWART: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: And if it's easier to deal 

with the qualified immunity, deal with it and forget the 

rest of it.

 MR. STEWART: I guess the first thing I 

would say in response to that is we think that the --

the balance or the way in which discretion will 

ordinarily be exercised will typically be different in 

the case of the lower courts than in the case of this 

Court, because the principal role of the lower Federal

courts is to decide individual cases before them usually 

in the most expeditious and noncontroversial way where 

they --

JUSTICE BREYER: I see that, but unless we 

do that here, they are never going to get the right 

message. And so what we will have is 1,000 judges 

trying in an average in a year 50 or 60 cases each with 

multiple facts, and we will have approximately over a 

10-year period hundreds of thousands. I've exaggerated, 

but there will be many, many -- many, many conflicts, 

many, many confusions. And unless we say, no, we are 

not doing it ourselves, how will they ever get the 

message?

 MR. STEWART: Well, I think they will get 

the message --

JUSTICE BREYER: We don't always have to do 

it, but I mean once.

 MR. STEWART: I think they will get the 

message if the Court tells them that the mandatory rule 

of Saucier is no longer in effect, that courts have 

discretion to decide based on their sound judgment 

whether it is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't it -- why 

isn't it an advisory opinion, if we do not have to 

decide -- to decide the ultimate question whether this

is constitutional or not, but simply whether or not it 

was clearly established whether it was unconstitutional? 

Why isn't it purely an advisory opinion to say whether 

it's constitutional or not?

 MR. STEWART: I mean, in one sense it's an 

advisory opinion, but in another sense there are --

there are often cases in which two alternative grounds 

for a decision are proffered, either one of which, if 

accepted, would compel a judgment in one litigant's 

favor. And the fact that it would theoretically -- if 

the court concludes there is only --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. Those are 

different grounds, it seems to me. Those are two 

independent, as you said. Here it's kind of a -- it's a 

progression. You first ask, either, under somebody's 

view, I guess, Saucier, whether or not it's 

constitutional or not and then whether it's clearly 

established.

 I just don't know why the first question 

isn't purely advisory, because you don't have to know 

whether it's constitutional or not.

 MR. STEWART: Well, it's true that if the 

Court announced that this search was constitutional, 

that it would necessarily be saying: And there was no 

clearly established constitutional law to the contrary

at the time the officers acted. But the Court --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- to the question. I 

mean, look, if I have to answer the constitutional 

question -- and what bothers me is this consent at one 

remove. What? You are saying a drug seller who lets in 

a disguised policeman in order to sell him a drug 

because he thinks he's a druggie is suddenly consenting 

to the entire LAPD coming into his house? I would think 

that is the last thing he would have thought about 

wanting, not the first.

 MR. STEWART: But that -- that would be 

equally true in the case of the undercover police 

officer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, maybe they both 

should be the same. I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's what I wanted to 

know, and it gets back to the merits and not Saucier. 

We are going through two different things here.

 Assume this is an undercover officer, not an 

-- not a -- not an informant. Now, the undercover 

officer sees a crime being committed, and he is ready to 

make the arrest. Can he automatically ask for police 

assistance and -- and other policemen? Are the police 

then entitled to come into the home in your view, or do 

there have to be some exigent circumstances?

MR. STEWART: No. We think he could 

automatically ask for the police to come into the home 

because the incremental intrusion on privacy by having 

several police officers rather than one to make the 

arrest would be insubstantial.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But isn't the reason it's 

insubstantial is that we have a rule for independent 

reasons having nothing necessarily to do with this kind 

of situation in which one officer's knowledge is 

regarded as another officer's knowledge. The police are 

regarded as a group, so that we have a rule ready, in 

place, saying: You show one, you have shown the whole 

department.

 We don't, however, have any such rule with 

respect to agents generally.

 MR. STEWART: I think you don't have that 

precise rule, but it is nevertheless the case that the 

undercover operative here, the informant, was a State 

actor. Had he been instructed to look in private places 

without consent, his conduct would have constituted a 

Fourth Amendment violation because he would have been 

regarded for that purpose as -- as an agent of the 

State, and he should, therefore, be regarded as a State 

agent for these purposes.

if -- if I may, I know your red light is on: Your 

position is if an undercover officer is in the premises 

and sees a crime being committed, he automatically can 

invite police in to assist him in making an arrest 

without exigent circumstances?

 MR. STEWART: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's -- what do I read? 

What authority do you cite me for that proposition?

 MR. STEWART: I don't think this -- this 

Court has ever squarely so held. I believe that the 

Respondents concede that because they don't take issue 

with the fact that consent once removed is applicable 

when the person already inside is an undercover police 

officer.

 This is a case about consent. By consenting 

to the entry of a confidential informant, that Mr.

This Court has long held that it is 

presumptively unreasonable for police to enter a home 

without consent or exigent circumstances or a warrant. 

Here there were no exigent circumstances; there was no 

warrant, nor was there any consent.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: YOU -- was Mr. 

Stewart correct that you concede that if this person 

entering the house were in fact a police officer, that 

this would have been okay?

 MR. METZLER: No, Your Honor. We think it's 

a closer case, but if it is a -- if this confidential 

informant had been a police officer, it would be the 

same analysis. There is no exigent circumstance here; 

there is no consent. And -- and the consent to be 

competent to the police officer in your case would not 

extend to the police officer in your case would not 

extend to the --

could make the -- the arrest by himself. Assuming he 

was a police officer --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- and -- but you are 

saying he can't ask for assistance to make that arrest 

effective in all cases. There has to be some exigent 

circumstance.

 MR. METZLER: Correct. If -- if there are 

some sort of exigent circumstances, in this case they 

would plan that in advance; and police are not allowed 

to create their own exigency to get around the Fourth 

Amendment.

 JUSTICE ALITO: You are advocating a rule 

that is going to get police officers killed, aren't they 

-- aren't you? If an undercover police officer is in a 

house making drug buy, and you want to say that the 

single officer who is there in an undercover capacity 

can say, "You guys are all under arrest," he can't 

signal for other police officers to come in and help him 

effect the arrest without anybody being killed?

 MR. METZLER: Of course, the safest thing 

for him would be to simply withdraw, get on the 

telephone, and get a warrant to come back in, or during 

the two hours that they were planning this entry he 

could have gotten a warrant then or an anticipatory 

warrant. There are plenty of stated options.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me that 

in the case that Justice Alito put, that there are

exigent circumstances.

 MR. METZLER: Well, to the extent they 

planned it in advance, and the basis of their entry --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -- that's a 

different point and I have some question about that. It 

seems to me the police are never quite sure exactly 

what's going to happen.

 MR. METZLER: Well, if they -- if they 

planned on an exigent circumstance as being the reason 

that they are allowed to go in, under this Court's 

decision -- the long line of decisions in Payton and 

Steagald saying exigent circumstances or consent are the 

way to get in without a warrant, then it would not be 

permissible. If --

JUSTICE BREYER: Imagining -- you are 

imagining different cases. We can imagine a spectrum of 

cases. In some cases the policeman or the confidential 

informant will be there, and he really couldn't have 

gotten a -- a thing in advance -- a warrant in advance. 

It wasn't certain, and they are in there and they see a 

lot of drug behavior going on, and the drugs are going 

to be hidden, go, disappear the second he leaves; and if 

he tries to arrest them, everybody is going to jump on 

him and kill him. Okay?

 So there are a lot of cases just like this

one, but with a few changes, which are -- he needs to 

call the police, and there will be others where he 

doesn't.

 So that's why I am so uncertain about what 

it is we are deciding here on the merits. We would have 

to say on the merits this is a case where there are no 

exigent circumstances. Can we say that? I -- would not 

want to "never are there."

 MR. METZLER: I think certainly in this case 

there were not exigent circumstances. The informant was 

on his way out the door. He -- he wasn't attempting to 

make an arrest. No one thought that the -- that Mr. 

Callahan would destroy the drugs or that anyone would 

leave. In fact, the Petitioners abandoned exigent 

circumstances in the court of appeal. So I think you 

can decide this case on the merits, as there were no 

exigent circumstances. And then ask, is it reasonable 

to think that because there was an informant inside and 

because he sent out a signal that there was probable 

cause, a drug transaction had happened inside the house, 

does that make any difference whatsoever as to whether 

there was consent?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a tough -- at 

least I find it a very difficult question. I do not 

find it necessarily a terribly difficult question

whether that -- whatever the answer is -- whether it was 

clearly established, precisely because I find the 

underlying questions difficult. So you have a handful 

Court of Appeals decisions, you have got a factual 

variation; the issue is whether to extend the police 

coming in to a confidential informant, all of those 

questions are very difficult; but precisely because they 

are, it doesn't seem that the rule, whichever rule is 

adopted, is clearly established.

 Why don't -- and yet if I were on the lower 

court of appeals, you would say -- or Saucier would say, 

I have got to decide that very difficult constitutional 

question and then decide what's a very easy qualified 

immunity question. Does that -- why does that make 

sense?

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think it's a difficult 

question.

don't because you are arguing one side of it.

granting cert on one. Why shouldn't the lower courts

 MR. METZLER: Well, with regard to the 

Saucier question, we think the Court should keep the 

Saucier question, and particularly in this case where 

there is a circuit split, the court should decide the 

constitutional question and not move on to the clearly 

established question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why, because we need 

to provide guidance on that question?

 MR. METZLER: Yes.

it can't come up any other way?

 MR. METZLER: It certainly could come up --

against the political subdivision, right? You could 

have sued some other political entity other than the 

officers individually, right?

sue the county in this case. But --

sure that the -- that the law continues to elaborate 

that potentially meritorious constitutional 

rights are --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that was 

my question. There are other ways for the law to 

develop. The issue can come up on merits in the suit 

against the municipality which doesn't raise the 

qualified immunity question. If you come up -- if you 

have a search where a person sues to get whatever was 

seized back. You know, if there's a -- and also the 

option is, if the question of which order want to 

proceed is optional, the law can develop if the courts

for good and sufficient reason decide to reach the 

constitutional question first.

 I -- I'm just wondering what benefit there 

is in an absolute rigid rule that courts of appeals -- I 

had a few of these cases in courts of appeals; I thought 

it was very odd that I had to go and decide a difficult 

constitutional issue and then not worry about it because 

in one sentence you say well, but the issue is not 

clearly established and so it's qualified immunity.

 MR. METZLER: Well, that would take us to 

back before Saucier, the Court -- it's a recent decision 

that hasn't been proven to be workable. And in fact --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but my point 

though is that at least in my experience it was 

unworkable, or at least frustrating, in that we had to 

decide not just a factual question but a constitutional 

question in a context where it wasn't necessary.

 MR. METZLER: Well, it depends on your view 

of necessity. In some cases certainly, it won't really 

come up in other contexts and the law is not established 

in section 1983; it may never be established. But here 

we are talking about a question where there is a circuit 

split and the Court definitely should provide guidance 

to the lower courts. I don't think that --

that there is a circuit split almost by definition mean 

that it's not clearly established?

 MR. METZLER: Well, this Court has looked to 

controlling -- its own precedents and controlling 

circuit law to decide what is -- what law is clearly 

established, and here, Payton and Steagald the courts 

held that there is a bright-line rule that's very simple 

for police officers, it's easy for them to understand.

 If they would like to enter without a 

warrant and they don't have exigent circumstances and 

they don't have consent, then it is presumptively 

unconstitutional. And it's a good rule and an easy rule 

and it's also why this is not a difficult constitutional 

question. There are no exigent circumstances in this 

case, and no reasonable officer could conclude that the 

presence of a confidential informant in the house means 

there is consent to the police officer.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What if -- what if the 

officers in this case had read the Seventh Circuit 

decision, and they said these are judges on the United 

States Court of Appeals, and they think this is 

consistent with the Fourth Amendment? And what's more, 

one of these is written -- one of these opinions is 

written by Judge Posner, and he's the smartest man in 

the world --

 JUSTICE ALITO: He knows everything there is 

to know about law and economics and jurisprudence and 

literature and many other subjects.

 (Laughter).

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it unreasonable for them 

to follow that?

 MR. METZLER: Well, I think the officers in 

the Tenth Circuit need to be aware the way that our 

Federal court system works, and the Seventh Circuit 

decision isn't binding on the Tenth Circuit. And with 

all due respect to Judge Posner, he dropped ball on this 

one. He says this -- this is a the case where -- it's 

the United States v Paul -- there are no exigent 

circumstances; the officers there could have gotten a 

warrant and in fact should have gotten a warrant but he 

said it was justified by consent. He's saying that 

consent to one person is consent to many. And this 

Court's cases have said that consent is based on 

ordinary social expectation. When you let one person 

into your house, you just don't let in the whole world.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the Tenth Circuit 

says this is not allowed, and every other circuit since 

the Tenth Circuit's decision has held that it is, is 

that clearly established that it's not allowed in the

Tenth Circuit?

 MR. METZLER: Yes. I think certainly an 

officer in the Tenth Circuit would be bound to follow 

the Tenth Circuit rule. I mean, it's not irrelevant 

that other -- that other courts have decided it 

differently, but to the extent that there is controlling 

law in the circuit, I think that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then it is 

irrelevant. Then it is irrelevant that ten other 

circuits have decided it differently.

 MR. METZLER: Well, that very well might 

wind up in this Court if --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, right, but do 

the police officers get to decide that? Do they get to 

decide that not only Judge Posner thinks this, but ten 

other circuits think this, and it has been five years 

since the Tenth Circuit. I mean, do they have to go 

through that type of analysis?

 MR. METZLER: Well, we don't expect officers 

to survey the entire case law and come up with a law 

professor's view of whether this is reasonable or not. 

We expect them to follow the clearly -- the bright lines 

that this Court has set down and that are set down in 

their home jurisdictions. And if their home 

jurisdiction says it's unconstitutional it's not

reasonable for them to follow some out-of-circuit 

decision. If, for instance, the Seventh Circuit had 

said that a warrantless home entry is okay so long as 

the officer had breakfast in the last half-hour, that's 

an unreasonable rule, and it wouldn't be reasonable for 

any officer to follow that. And the facts here are 

about as relevant to consent as to whether there was --

the officer had breakfast that morning.

 So the officers here are not entitled to 

qualify -- nor can they rely on the Seventh Circuit. 

The Petitioners have not given you any reason to adopt a 

new exception here. They say this is based on a waiver 

theory or that it's a private search or that it is 

incident to arrest. But all of those ignore the 

substantial interest in the sanctity of the home.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do any of the other 

cases involve -- the other circuit cases involve 

confidential informants as opposed to police officers?

 MR. METZLER: Other than the Seventh 

Circuit?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MR. METZLER: The -- one case in the Sixth 

Circuit there was both a confidential informant and a 

police officer were admitted. And then there's a later 

case in the Sixth Circuit that did say this is okay for

it, which came after this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So at the time every 

circuit other than the -- you know, if there is a police 

officer and a confidential informant, I think that could 

be considered a police officer because he is going to 

call the police in -- every court of appeals decision 

involving a confidential informant said it was okay.

 MR. METZLER: Actually we have cited three 

circuits where these same facts happened. In the Eighth 

Circuit, the First Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And in those 

circuits, did the court focus on the distinction between 

the police officer and the confidential informant?

 MR. METZLER: Well, no. The court looked to 

whether there were exigent circumstances or consent. 

The courts followed this Court's decision in Payton and 

Bramble and that line of cases.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you believe 

that -- what is the appropriate level of generality to 

look at in addressing this question, a case involving a 

confidential informant?

 MR. METZLER: I think the appropriate level 

of generality is that the facts under the court -- the 

court has covered the field when it comes to warrantless 

home entries. If you have a warrant, you are okay. If

you have exigent circumstances, you are okay. And if 

you have consent, you are okay. Everything else is 

presumptively unconstitutional.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that?

 MR. METZLER: That's a good question.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't it that 

the issue hasn't come up, this question of a 

confidential informant is one that hasn't come up? Why 

would we say that is presumptively unconstitutional?

 MR. METZLER: Well, the Court's language is 

presumptively unconstitutional has said that many times.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You are talking about the 

main role of police is get a warrant, except -- and I 

think the Court has said a number of times to make this 

search reasonable, the police have to get a warrant if 

you want to interject the judicial between police and 

the person in jeopardy. So the main rule is warrant 

unless -- and then you have exceptions, but I think your 

point is that there is a main rule.

 MR. METZLER: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: This Court has gotten 

from the Constitution?

 MR. METZLER: Yes.

a situation where the exigent circumstances are the 

creation of the scenario that the police have set up, 

the police cannot -- and you have a police officer who 

is being the undercover operative who has the power to 

make an arrest, that police officer cannot signal for 

other officers to come in and assist with the arrest?

 MR. METZLER: Well, our position is that 

would be -- the additional officer entry would violate 

the Constitution --

JUSTICE ALITO: The additional officers 

would -- that would violate the Fourth Amendment?

 MR. METZLER: Yes.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Even if there is an officer 

safety problem there?

 MR. METZLER: Well, to the extent that they 

have created an officer safety problem, obviously the 

officers are going to go in to help him, no one is going 

to get hurt. But the additional officer's entry can 

violate the Fourth Amendment.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So the police say, you 

know, we made a mistake. We should have had a warrant, 

but we have our man in there now, we have got to do 

something. The police cannot send assistance?

 MR. METZLER: No, of course, they can send 

assistance. And they probably --

the additional officer's entry would violate the Fourth 

Amendment. Now, there might be limited --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So -- so my first 

statement was correct. It's illegal for the police to 

send their assistance, the other officers in?

 MR. METZLER: Yes, my answer was as a 

practical matter no -- no police officer is going to 

leave, even if --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but then he is 

going to get sued.

 MR. METZLER: He very well may get sued and 

there are questions of fact as to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you say as a practical 

matter we have to say that under the Constitution we can 

endanger -- we must endanger the officer?

 MR. METZLER: Well, I disagree that the 

officer could be in danger --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. The hypothetical 

is that they have to send people in to assist him. But 

the hypothetical also is they should have anticipated 

this, and therefore, in your words, they created exigent 

circumstances.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that 

dilemma and that paradox casts considerable doubt on 

your proposition that if the police create the exigent 

circumstances, they cannot rely on it. I seriously 

question that proposition.

 MR. METZLER: Even if -- even if you 

disagree with me on that, it shouldn't make any 

difference in this case where there was no exigent 

circumstances.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no. I want to talk 

about the general rule.

 MR. METZLER: Okay. Well, the general --

never mind --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You want us to write an 

opinion saying that any time police create the exigent 

circumstances, they can't rely on them if they had had 

the time to get a warrant. And I find that a dangerous 

rule.

 MR. METZLER: I don't think you would need 

to to write the opinion that would say that, because 

exigent circumstances are not in this case.

adopted the positions that for purposes of establishing 

probable cause, the knowledge of one police officer is 

also the knowledge of all police officers, at least 

within a department or working on a particular problem. 

So that if in a case in which there is a search without 

a warrant, if you add up everything that individual 

officers knew and that amounts to probable cause, then 

the search is good.

 Why don't we apply, in effect, the same rule 

in the hypothetical case that you have been given, which 

is a police officer who was admitted by consent and 

there are other police officers outside. At the point 

at which the police officer who has been admitted has 

the knowledge necessary for an arrest and has that 

knowledge as a result of the invitation and the waiver 

of privacy as to him, why don't we regard that on sort 

of general doctrinal grounds as a waiver of privacy with 

respect to the police in general, just as we regard 

police knowledge as being imputed to all police 

officers?

 That way you don't have the problem that, 

for example, Justice Kennedy's hypo raises, even in the 

case of exigent circumstances. But it doesn't open the 

door to what you were objecting to here. Why isn't that 

a proper solution or proper answer to this hypo?

MR. METZLER: Well, if you are to adopt that 

sort of -- I think you certainly could adopt that 

rationale. But I don't think the way to get there is 

through a waiver, because real there's nothing that the 

person -- the suspect has done that he knows about that 

would mean that he waived the expectation that 

additional people would come in. There might be --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, you are absolutely 

right in terms of his psychological process, the only 

person he has invited in is the one person. The reason 

for coming up with the answer I suggested is a broader 

doctrinal reason. That is the reason that we have for 

probable cause purposes regarded the police -- or the 

knowledge of one police officer as the knowledge for 

all.

 Why don't we, for the same reasons, since it 

is privacy that is at stake in all of these cases, 

regard the invitation of one police officer as the 

invitation of all, or to all?

 MR. METZLER: Again, I don't think that the 

way to get there is through consent. If you want it to 

balance and say, well, the government has an agent in 

there who is making the arrest and there is safety 

concerns and other reasons why we would want to do that, 

that might be one way to get there. I don't think it's

through consent.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It would be consent to one 

officer plus a doctrinal basis to construe that consent 

for Fourth Amendment purposes as a broader consent.

 MR. METZLER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's what we would be 

doing. We wouldn't be doing it because the individual 

in the trailer says I am inviting in the whole L.A. 

police department. We are doing it because he invites 

one L.A. police officer in, and we have doctrinal basis 

for regarding the police, as it were, collectively 

rather than individually for probable cause purposes 

when privacy is at stake.

 MR. METZLER: That would be -- that would 

certainly be a basis to allow for police officers.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Would it not open the door 

to, I guess, to what you are objecting to?

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why would probable cause 

solve the problem at all? There is clearly probable 

cause here. They are listening to what goes on. So 

they're -- do you dispute that when they hear that the 

drug transaction is taking place, that they lack 

probable cause?

 MR. METZLER: No, I think they do have 

probable cause. But in Payton, the Court said that

police officers who are outside who have probable cause 

need more than probable cause to get inside. They need 

a warrant, exigent circumstances.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. I think I may have 

created this problem for you and -- and maybe I -- I 

should get you out of it.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm not suggesting that the 

probable cause rule is what is operative here. I'm 

saying that for probable cause purposes we regard the 

police collectively, and why, since our privacy is at 

stake there and is at stake here -- why shouldn't we 

have a collective consent rule, too?

 MR. METZLER: You certainly could --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That -- that's my proposal.

 MR. METZLER: You certainly could adopt that 

rule, and that would be a -- an additional reason for 

police to enter beyond what has been thus far 

established by this Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you decide 

whether the confidential informant should be considered 

an employee of the police? Let's say this is the tenth 

undercover operation he has engaged in. They give him 

$100 after every undercover operation. I mean, is he an 

employee of the police department?

MR. METZLER: I don't think his employment 

status is -- is what is at issue. The question is 

whether he is an agent of the state for the purpose that 

he is inside -- for the purposes of making an arrest of 

the person inside the home.

 Here the confidential informant, all he is 

really doing is acting as a surveillance device. He is 

telling the officers outside what is happening inside. 

And he gives them probable cause.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why doesn't -- that 

doesn't make him an agent of the police?

 MR. METZLER: No, I don't think so. He 

might be an agent for some purposes but he is not an 

agent for purposes of making an arrest inside, which is 

what they want to do.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What is it there is a State 

statute that says that confidential informants may be 

designated by the police department to assist in making 

arrests?

 MR. METZLER: If there was some assist to 

making an arrest -- of the government, then assuming we 

are following Justice Souter's few exceptions, then I 

think that they would fall into that exception. But 

here, of course, the confidential informant is no such 

thing. This confidential informant was not active

politically. He wasn't making an arrest. There was 

no --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: He wasn't acting on 

his own. He was acting for the police. He didn't 

decide I'm going to do this and -- because you know, I 

want to do it, and it just so happens the police are 

involved as well.

 MR. METZLER: Well, that's true. He was 

acting with the police but he wasn't acting for the 

police. And nothing that the -- that the confidential 

informant did inside, even if attributed to the police, 

would give police the right to cross that threshold. If 

this confidential informant were a police officer, I 

think you would have to base it on the power of the 

police to make the arrest inside, the power of the State 

to make that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even if there is such a 

thing as citizen's arrest, I think it was part of this 

record that -- that they do not want confidential 

informers to go making arrests, so that the police 

distinguish the confidential informer.

 MR. METZLER: That's correct, 

Justice Ginsburg. Both the Solicitor General and the 

Petitioners agree that confidential informants should 

not and would not be making these arrests. So the

function of the confidential informant is really as I 

said, just a surveillance device; and what is important 

is not what he is doing but what the police are doing 

who are outside.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But going back to why 

should we decide this question, particularly in Fourth 

Amendment cases when these issues will come up on 

suppression motions, so there isn't a need to decide 

them in the -- in the civil context.

 MR. METZLER: But I think in general we are 

talking about a very small category of cases like this 

one where their -- the criminal defendant won on the 

Fourth Amendment and then the police bring up some new 

argument on a qualified immunity defense because there 

would already be some law on the questions that were 

decided in the -- in the criminal case.

 So in those limited circumstances it seems 

to put too much of a thumb on the scale on the side of 

police that says well, you can come up with a new theory 

and you don't even have to show that it applies; all you 

have to show is that nobody has ever rejected your 

theory and then it is not fairly established. I don't 

think in that small number of cases that the balance 

should really tilt that far towards police. And here, 

here it's certainly not, where the Solicitor General and

the Petitioners both agree that the Court should decide 

both questions.

 The constitutional question here is not very 

difficult. It boils down to, in the absence of exigent 

circumstances, could any reasonable officer have 

believed that the two circumstances they would like to 

see in previous cases -- that is, that a confidential 

informant is inside, and that he sends a signal out that 

there is probable cause -- do those make any difference 

whatsoever to the calculation of whether there are 

exigent circumstances or consent? The answer is no and 

no reasonable officer could have believed otherwise. If 

there are no further questions.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY PETER STIRBA,

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. STIRBA: The colloquy about the safety 

concerns when the officer or the confidential informer 

are in the home I think highlight why the distinction 

between a confidential informant and the officer really 

doesn't make much meaningful headway in terms of the 

Fourth Amendment. Obviously if the police officer was 

acting under cover in this particular situation he would

not have announced -- there were three arrestees who 

were actually in the premises at the time of the 

follow-up entry. He would not have said after the drug 

transaction occurred "oh, by the way, I'm a police 

officer, I'm here to arrest you," for obvious reasons 

connoting safety and other issues which would have been 

attendant to them.

 Similarly the confidential informant isn't 

going to do that, either, for the same particular 

problem, even if the confidential informant had arrested 

powers under State law. The issue is the police officer 

can call up for backup and assistance to effectuate 

arrest, which is specifically what occurred here. 

Similarly, there is no really distinction to be drawn 

between a confidential informant as a government actor 

allowing for the additional entry or follow-up entry of 

additional officers for backup and assistance to make 

sure the arrest is safe and secure than if you have a 

police officer.

 The second point I would like to make is the 

first time any Federal circuit drew this distinction 

between a confidential informant and a police officer 

was the Tenth Circuit decision. They adopted consent 

once removed. They just limited it to a police officer.

could not reasonably be expected to anticipate such a 

distinction being drawn, especially given the fact that 

there was at least a Seventh Circuit body of law, the 

Sixth Circuit body of law, and as we argue, which we 

think is a fair reading of Gramble -- because they cite 

the Seventh Circuit body of law that includes the 

confidential informant -- there were at least three 

circuits that rejected that distinction, and you in 2000 

confirmed that in the Sixth Circuit there is no 

distinction as a matter of this particular doctrine 

between a confidential informant and a police officer.

 And finally with respect to the exigent 

circumstances cases, and you can look at any one that 

was cited by the Respondent, there is no mention of 

Lewis, there is no mention of consent once removed, 

there is no mention of any abrogation of privacy. Those 

issues were not raised, just like the issues were not 

raised in the criminal appeal of Mr. Callahan's 

conviction; and so therefore they are really not 

relevant, they are not probative, and we are not 

suggesting this is an exigent circumstances case, nor 

are we suggest relying on for purposes of the Fourth 

Amendment issue any implied consent.

 We have rested our -- the justification for 

the Fourth Amendment issue on search incident and also
