 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in case 06-5754, Rita versus United 

States. 

Mr. Cochran.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS N. COCHRAN

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. COCHRAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Under the system described in 

Justice Breyer's opinion for the Court in Booker, judges 

would no longer be tied to the sentencing range 

indicated in the guidelines. That, of course, was a 

passage from this Court's recent decision in Cunningham 

versus California. Mr. Rita is asking the Court in this 

case to reiterate in strong enforceable terms that it 

meant what it said in Booker, that the guidelines are 

merely advisory provisions. The Government's assertion 

that the guidelines deserve a presumption of 

reasonableness was nothing more than an unfounded claim 

put forth to justify its efforts to try and thwart the 

Booker decision.

 The ink wasn't given a chance to dry on the 

Booker decision before the Department of Justice issued

a memo to all of its Federal prosecutors directing that 

they adhere to the guidelines and that they seek 

sentences within the guidelines in all but extraordinary 

cases.

 The district court below in this case did 

not treat the guidelines as advisory when it imposed a 

33-month within guideline sentence. The district court 

did not consider Mr. Rita's military record, the fact 

that he had been a combat soldier in two wars.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How can you say that, 

given that at the sentencing hearing, that military 

record was brought out, his physical ailments were 

brought out, his activity in law enforcement, all that 

was brought out? And indeed, the judge was assisting 

the defense attorney to make the case clearer when it 

was presented.

 MR. COCHRAN: In the district court, 

Mr. Rita did put forward evidence of his military 

records, health concerns, he -- the district court 

received that information. The district court did not 

consider that information because there's nothing in the 

record where the district judge weighed any of that 

information to determine what -- what effect to give any 

of it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you know, you don't

get a summary judgment case all the time. I used to get 

them, and the district court would hear all the 

arguments and write down the word denied. Does that 

mean he didn't consider the arguments? That's a very 

common thing. Here we have a district judge, he hears 

all the arguments. The attorneys brought it out. It's 

in the file. He reads the presentence report. It's all 

there, and the judge says, on balance, I'm going to go 

apply the guidelines. So how can you say he didn't 

consider them?

 MR. COCHRAN: Justice Breyer, the district 

judge didn't say that we're going to weigh all of the 

stuff, and I --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, he doesn't in a summary 

judgment case either. I mean, I've had quite a few of 

them, I used to, I think, where they just wrote denied. 

That was the opinion.

 MR. COCHRAN: Well, in the instance of a 

summary judgment matter, we don't have 3553(c), that 

requires the district court to state in open court in 

front of the defendant the reasons for the imposition of 

sentence.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, he says the reasons 

are these. I think that the guidelines sentence is a 

reasonable sentence. Would that be sufficient?

MR. COCHRAN: It would not, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? What in the 

statute or the law or the Constitution says that a 

district judge, although it might be good form in a 

difficult case to write more, but I've often written 

opinions where I say, and the remaining arguments we 

feel are not sufficient to change the result. That 

means I don't think they're that great an argument, and 

I don't answer every single one.

 MR. COCHRAN: With regard to the first 

question Your Honor posed, it's not sufficient for the 

district court to simply state conclusions, which is 

what happened in this case, that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Where in the law does it 

say that?

 MR. COCHRAN: Well, in 3553(c), it requires 

that the judge give the reasons for the imposition of 

the particular sentence.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Where -- I'm looking at 

that. It says shall consider. Am I missing something?

 MR. COCHRAN: The preamble states --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me your page 

cite?

 MR. COCHRAN: I'm sorry, Your Honor, on page 

3-A of Petitioner's brief in the appendix. It states,

"the court at the time of sentencing shall state in open 

court the reasons for its imposition of the particular 

sentence." And that's what we contend requires the 

district court to explain the facts that the court is 

relying on to impose the particular sentence in the 

case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So it isn't sufficient, in 

your view, that the judge just says, the reason I 

imposed this sentence is that's the guideline sentence, 

and I think in this circumstance it's reasonable?

 MR. COCHRAN: That's correct, Your Honor. 

Because the guidelines don't take into account all the 

myriad facts, and in this case, did not take into 

account the military record, the employment record, 

Mr. Rita's health concerns. The guidelines specifically 

did not take those into account.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I think these other factors 

that have been brought out, while they're serious 

factors, I don't think they're enough to warrant a 

different sentence. Suppose he adds those words?

 MR. COCHRAN: Your Honor, I think the --

JUSTICE BREYER: What I'm worried about 

basically is, I don't think in the law there's a special 

category that requires a judge to give special reasons 

in a guideline case. I think it's the same as any other

matter. Judges do normally give reasons. And I'd worry 

a bit about creating a special situation where district 

judges have to do something unusual.

 MR. COCHRAN: I don't think that this is 

unusual, Your Honor. I think the court has to explain 

the rationale for imposing the sentence, and not only 

does it have to do so in court, in front of the 

defendant, so the defendant understands the sentence 

that he is receiving --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I get where you're 

going. Can I say this in an opinion, would this satisfy 

you? And of course, like any other matter, judges do 

normally give reasons. They do normally reject 

arguments with reasons, and it's the same here. Would 

that satisfy you?

 MR. COCHRAN: I think it would have to be 

specific to the issues raised by the parties. And in 

this case, at a minimum, the judge would have to address 

the three issues that Mr. Rita put forward and discuss 

those: His military record, his employment, his health 

concerns. It would have to address any issues that the 

Government would raise, and any issues that the district 

judge was considering that maybe neither party had 

raised to the court as well.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How do you reconcile the

language in the prologue of (c) which says, the court 

shall state the reasons, with (c)(2), which says that if 

the sentence is not of the kind or is outside the range 

described in (a)(4) of the guidelines, the court shall 

state the specific reason for the imposition of a 

sentence different from the guidelines?

 Now, this seems to set up some dichotomy 

between giving reasons and giving the specific reason. 

Where does that line fall in your estimation?

 MR. COCHRAN: Well, I think foremost, Your 

Honor, is that that provision came about prior to the 

Booker decision when the guidelines were mandatory. And 

what that addresses and what it was meant to address was 

if the court were to depart, then it was -- it needed to 

explain that departure in a greater reason to enable the 

sentencing commission to take that information into 

account in revising the guidelines.

 That is still a purpose with the sentencing 

commission, to revise the guidelines, and they can still 

use that information. But it -- at the very least, we 

need information from the sentencing judge about each of 

the matters that he or she --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You haven't answered my 

question. I mean, you explain why it's put in there, 

but I want to know what is the difference between giving

the reasons and giving the specific reason.

 MR. COCHRAN: The specific reason I think, 

Your Honor, is so that the sentencing commission can 

take that information into account in later revisions of 

the guidelines. That was the purpose at the point that 

statute was passed.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But are you saying now that 

that distinction should be ignored?

 MR. COCHRAN: I don't know, Your Honor, if 

it's so much that it should be ignored inasmuch as the 

district court needs to give as many reasons, or as 

clear a reason for the imposition of the particular 

sentence. That will help --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it sounds to me as 

though you want all the reasons to be specific. I mean, 

I understand your argument. But if we accept that 

argument, then the distinction between reason and 

specific reason basically is going to be a matter of 

history, and perhaps it should be.

 MR. COCHRAN: It, it may, Your Honor. And, 

and because that provision predated this Court's Booker 

decision, it still holds relevance but not nearly the 

relevance it had when the guidelines were mandatory.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So your position would 

be, Mr. Cochran, that the obligation to be even-handed

would have to -- that the trial judge would also have to 

go through -- now this defendant maintained his 

innocence. He didn't express any remorse. He accused a 

Government agent of perjury. All that, he would have to 

take into account, just as specifically?

 MR. COCHRAN: Your Honor, I think that the 

Court certainly could consider all of that; and -- and 

if pressed by the Government would need to consider 

that. But certainly at a minimum, the Court needs to 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that what the 

Government pressed at the sentencing hearing?

 MR. COCHRAN: It did, Your Honor, and again 

the district court never came out with any specifics 

regarding any of those issues other than the conclusion 

that it felt that the guideline range was not 

inappropriate.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the district court 

says I give these following -- I've considered these 

following specific factors. But in my view, the 

consistency and nationwide uniformity that the 

guidelines strive to achieve is of great importance; and 

for that reason, I'm following the guidelines?

 MR. COCHRAN: I don't --

judgment for the district court to make?

 MR. COCHRAN: I think it's inappropriate, 

Your Honor, because while there should be uniformity in 

an attempt to move in that direction, uniformity is not 

the end all and be all. 3553(a) addresses 

individualized sentencing of the defendant before the 

court.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not the end all. 

Suppose the district judge said I think this is of great 

importance. You don't think that the Booker opinion --

or do you think the Booker opinion rejected uniformity 

and consistency as an important factor?

 MR. COCHRAN: I don't believe the Booker 

decision rejected that, Your Honor. What I believe the 

Booker opinion said was that for there to be advisory 

guidelines, for there to be constitutional sentencing 

practices, then uniformity is going to have to give way 

to some extent. At least at the very beginning.

 Once the district courts apply the 3553(a) 

factors, and go through the statute, and consider the 

guidelines, the district courts will then explain their 

rationale; and then that rationale will be -- in our 

opinion, will show where the shortcomings of the 

guidelines are.

the sentencing in this case violated the Sixth 

Amendment?

 MR. COCHRAN: Not as it was applied. It 

came close in the sense that the district court was 

laboring, in our opinion, under the belief that the 

guidelines held some control.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If it didn't violate the 

Sixth Amendment, then your argument is based on the 

Sentencing Reform Act?

 MR. COCHRAN: Well, it came -- it may have 

violated the Sixth Amendment. I don't know that I would 

concede that. But to avoid any constitutional issue, if 

we analyzed this under the statute, clearly the district 

court didn't comply with the statute.

 JUSTICE ALITO: You can't say whether it did 

or did not violate the Sixth Amendment?

 MR. COCHRAN: The district court held the 

guidelines to a greater quantum than simply advisory.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, was your client's 

sentence enhanced by any fact that should have been 

submitted to the jury?

 MR. COCHRAN: Well, under -- under a pure 

advisory system -- and I think Your Honor is addressing 

the cross-reference in this matter -- in a purely 

advisory system, the guidelines were calculated

correctly in Mr. Rita's case, because under a purely 

advisory system, the district court could look at that 

cross-reference, understand that it came about from 

uncharged and unproven conduct, and disregard it.

 But by not doing so in this case, and that 

cross enhancement doubled his effective guideline range, 

then this case may very well be unconstitutional because 

of the extra weight that the court gave the guidelines.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Mr. Cochran, you do 

contend, do you not, that if the guidelines had been 

mandatory, there would have been a violation of the 

Sixth Amendment.

 MR. COCHRAN: No question, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Because of the, the 

accessory after the fact point.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's right, Your Honor, 

absolutely.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Then the question 

ultimately is, does it violate the Sixth Amendment to 

say that we have a presumption there, a sentence is in 

the guidelines as a reasonable -- if you're an appellate 

court judge. And you think it does violate the Sixth 

Amendment?

 MR. COCHRAN: Our position is that the 

presumption does violate the Sixth --

JUSTICE BREYER: Then I guess the argument 

of the other side, which I would like you to address, is 

that, in which there -- we didn't think it violated the 

of Sixth Amendment if the district judge simple applied 

3553 -- uh, 3553(a). And of course, 3553(a) includes 

all of these things that go into the guidelines; it make 

a big point of that in 3553(a).

 So why -- why couldn't you say, you know, 

all these factors are taken into account by the 

commission? They start with an effort to a apply them 

in typical cases. This is their judgment in typical 

cases. So it is entitled to some kind of weight; and --

at least in a typical case.

 MR. COCHRAN: Your Honor, the guidelines 

should be consulted. No question --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, not consulting 

them. What I'm trying to do is to how much weight can a 

judge reading this give them without violating the Sixth 

Amendment? All I'm trying to do here is not whether the 

guidelines are good, bad, or indifferent. Congress 

wanted to apply them. We excised the mandatory to 

comply with the Sixth Amendment. Now, what else do we 

have to do to comply with the Sixth Amendment? Because 

I would think unless we have to do something else, we 

shouldn't do it, because Congress wanted it.

MR. COCHRAN: I would contend, Your Honor, 

that the Court needs to very clearly explain that the 

guidelines are, are a reference. They are --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The guidelines are what?

 MR. COCHRAN: Are a reference.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you say it is an 

initial benchmark?

 MR. COCHRAN: I don't -- when we start 

establishing benchmarks and presumptions, I think that's 

where we, we --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So benchmarks are bad. 

Presumption is bad. Great weight, that's bad?

 MR. COCHRAN: That's bad, too. And I think 

it's just another thing to consider.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does it matter what 

judge did in other cases? I mean, if we look on the day 

before he said, well, the guidelines say this, but I 

think this case is different, so I'm going to depart, 

and the day after he says I know what the guidelines 

are, but I'm going to impose a higher sentence?

 I mean, how do we know he's -- when he says 

I looked at the guidelines and I think they're 

appropriate, that he's considering himself bound by 

something that he may or may not agree with, as opposed 

to what he said? Which is, well, I cannot find that

they're inappropriate?

 MR. COCHRAN: And what that tells me, 

Mr. Chief Justice, is that, that the district court felt 

that the guidelines had a center of gravity, that the 

judge was bound -- in other words, shifted the burden to 

the defendant to say, well, I -- unless you can show 

that these are inappropriate, that it is a setting of a 

benchmark, it's a drawing of a line, and we contend that 

that is what the Sixth Amendment prohibits.

 If the guidelines are advisory, if they are 

but one of many factors to be considered, together with 

all of the other factors in 3553(a), the court can use 

that information, can use that reference. But once it 

starts putting any greater weight on the guidelines --

and the statute doesn't admit to that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about the point that 

Justice Breyer made that these other factors have been 

taken into account by the sentencing commission because 

Congress told them to consider those same factors?

 MR. COCHRAN: Well, Your Honor, the 

sentencing commission by its own admission has not taken 

into account all of the factors. In the very first 

guideline manual, 1987, the sentencing commission itself 

said it could not take into account all of the facts 

that play into human conduct.

JUSTICE BREYER: There are two separate 

things there. The general aims of sentencing, the four 

basic aims of sentencing, I believe the commission 

certainly took into account. A separate thing was the 

rule that said you can depart only for a matter that has 

not been fully considered by the guidelines.

 And there the original version, I believe, 

said that we've considered nothing thoroughly. Except 

for certain specific matters that had been mentioned 

like age, race, and we'll refer to statutorily. Now, 

that is what you're thinking of? I mean, if that's what 

you're thinking of, I don't think it's relevant to what 

your present point is.

 MR. COCHRAN: I'm not, Your Honor. First of 

all, I don't know and would contend that the initial 

sentencing commission did not take into account all of 

the four purposes of sentencing. They centered on crime 

control --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's because when they 

looked at all of the literature, they explained it, the 

rehabilitative purpose was not that it wasn't taken into 

account, it was there was a consensus among experts that 

there isn't much you can do about it. That's different 

from not taking into account.

 MR. COCHRAN: The other point I think with

regard to that, Your Honor, is in looking at 3553(a) 

that statute gives the district court the dual commands 

of first considering all of those factors and then 

imposing a sentence sufficient but not greater than 

necessary. The statute does not give to the sentencing 

commission that obligation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Cochran, I have this 

concern: If we accept your submission that the district 

court should just consider the guidelines together with 

everything else, give them a presumption of validity, 

anything else, just something to consider, that would 

presumably eliminate any Sixth Amendment problem with 

the district court's findings of fact.

 But the district court's sentence is going 

to go on appeal. And the appellate court in reviewing 

it for reasonableness, let's assume in this case the 

appellate -- the appellate court says oh, no, this 

person had -- we find as a matter of fact, given the 

record, military service, you know, which we think 

should have been taken into account. And, therefore, we 

set it aside.

 Now, the next case that comes up, which 

doesn't have the element of military service, in all 

other respects the same as your client's case, it comes 

up to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals

would say, ah, we don't have that different fact here 

and therefore we affirm the sentence.

 Isn't -- in other words isn't the finding of 

a fact necessary for the process of judicial review, 

even if it is not made necessary for the purposes of the 

district court's determination? He would not get that 

sentence but for this fact.

 MR. COCHRAN: That's correct, Your Honor. 

And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you haven't shown us a 

way out of the problem.

 MR. COCHRAN: In a purely advisory system, 

the district court is bound by the statutory minimum and 

maximum. And as this Court has said in Cunningham, if 

the Court is bound simply by that statutory minimum and 

maximum, then the factual finding as to where within 

that is up to the district court.

 It's only when we establish thresholds as 

the guidelines do we run into the constitutional 

problem.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, even if you don't --

don't establish thresholds by reason of the guideline, 

you are establishing thresholds upon judicial review, 

guidelines or not.

given there's this fact in this case, the sentence below 

was reasonable, but in the next case, where that fact 

does not exist, the court of appeals says, ah, the 

sentence is unreasonable, in other words, that fact is 

made a necessary condition for giving the higher 

sentence.

 So you haven't -- you haven't solved the 

problem of the, of the apparent conflict between --

between Booker and the advisory guidelines.

 MR. COCHRAN: Well, I think so long as the 

district court can evaluate and consider and potentially 

reject what the guidelines say, just as the Court can 

consider the effect of -- of the person's military 

record, Mr. Rita was a combat veteran in two wars, which 

is separate and apart from someone who may have been an 

Army recruiter --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You're not focusing on my 

point. I concede that the district court is free as a 

bird -- free as a bird -- but you have appellate review. 

And the appellate court in reviewing for reasonableness 

is going to make a particular fact determinative of 

whether this sentence can stand or not. Isn't that 

right?

 MR. COCHRAN: It is.

problem.

 MR. COCHRAN: I think what the court would 

have -- the appellate court would have to do is evaluate 

all of that through the prism of 3553(a). Is the 

sentence that was imposed the least sufficient sanction 

that the court below could have imposed. And if not, 

for whatever reasons, vacate it and return it back to 

the district court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what if 

there weren't guidelines at all, and the district court 

said maybe, you know, it's new, I want to see what other 

judges have done; he presses a button on the computer, 

give me what the sentences were looking at these facts, 

and finds out in the last 100 cases, this is what the 

sentence was. And he says this seems to me no different 

than those and that's the sentence I'm going to impose. 

Is there any problem with that?

 MR. COCHRAN: There is. And again, because 

3553(a) is an individual weighing of the defendant --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, well, he looks 

at all the individual factors and he says they seem not 

terribly different from these 100 other cases and the 

range in those 100 other cases was, you know, 5 to 7 

years, and so I'm going to give him 5 years.

 MR. COCHRAN: If the district court

considers all those facts and considers what may have 

been done and it is sufficient, if not greater than 

necessary given those facts, then the court can do that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How is that 

different than the -- how is that different than looking 

at the guidelines, which did that in a much more 

comprehensive way, and saying, I don't see anything 

different in this case from the normal guidelines case 

and so I'm going to impose that sentence?

 MR. COCHRAN: Well, the guidelines didn't 

take everything into account, and the sentencing courts 

were coming from 18 years of mandatory guidelines, of 

being required to follow this book that necessarily 

didn't incorporate all of the human factors in 

sentencing. And they have held to that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it did incorporate 

them in that district judges were free to depart from 

the guidelines if indeed they found there was some one 

of these human factors not considered by the guidelines 

which existed in the particular case.

 MR. COCHRAN: In theory, yes, 

Justice Scalia. But in practice, no, because what 

happened in the very cases as United States versus Foy 

out of the Ninth Circuit, the defendant in that case 

argued to the district court that he should have a

departure based upon lack of mutual guidance, and it was 

a reasoned decision.  It went to the Ninth Circuit. The 

Ninth Circuit found it to be a reasoned decision; and 

within the next amendment process of the Sentencing 

Commission, it was eliminated as a departure basis with 

no discussion at all.

 So yes, there may have been departures, but 

they were systematically removed, and in fact chapters 

5(h) and 5(a) show that very clearly.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, if they were 

systematically removed then all of these other human 

factors that you're complaining about were considered by 

the guideline commission and were simply rejected.

 MR. COCHRAN: They weren't considered, Your 

Honor, and in the history of those amendments that's 

borne out.

 And if the Court has no further questions, 

I'd like to reserve some time.

presumption of reasonableness in reviewing the sentence 

imposed pursuant to the advisory guidelines system that 

this Court announced in United States versus Booker. 

The guidelines represent the integration of the multiple 

purposes of sentencing reflected in section 3553(a) that 

the district court is obligated to consider. The 

commission also represents an expert body that has 

considered the various parameters of sentencing and the 

fact patterns that arise in the Federal system and has 

made an effort over time to arrive at an appropriate --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Isn't it true, just to get 

one thought out on the table, that there are factors 

that the guidelines don't -- did not consider, such as 

military service?

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Stevens, the 

commission considered that factor and then determined 

that it was not generally appropriate to a sentence 

outside the guidelines.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But isn't it true that 

under the guideline no weight is given to military 

service?

 MR. DREEBEN: The guidelines specifically do 

not give weight to it. They permit a judge --

he thought some weight should be given to military

service?

 MR. DREEBEN: Under Booker the judge should 

do that. That is the difference between an advisory 

guidelines system and a mandatory guidelines system. 

The judge can give weight to factors That the commission 

decided should not have weight in the sentencing 

process. That is the essence of what it means for the 

guidelines --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And presumably cannot give 

weight to factors that the commission decided should 

have weight.

 MR. DREEBEN: He can do that, too, 

Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Are we back to the original 

version, which I'll read what it says. It says: "With 

a few specific exceptions -- race, sex, national origin, 

creed, religion, socioeconomic State -- with those 

exceptions, the commission does not intend to limit the 

kinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere else 

in the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for 

departure in an unusual case." That's what it said. A 

part of the guidelines in the heartland. If it's not 

the heartland, depart.

 Now, what I wonder is are we not back under 

your theory of it just to where we were when it started

out, before the commission started ruling all these 

things out and began to make all its -- the judge could 

do that.

 MR. DREEBEN: I think we're back, 

Justice Breyer, to a further point even than the first 

set of guidelines, because even under the first set of 

guidelines application of the guidelines was mandatory 

unless the court found an aggravating or mitigating 

circumstance that wasn't taken into account.

 JUSTICE BREYER: We said we took nothing 

into account and therefore any circumstance that makes 

the case unusual would be in principle a ground for an 

exception.

 MR. DREEBEN: I understand that, 

Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying more than 

that is necessary.

 MR. DREEBEN: I think that the 

reconciliation of this Court's merits opinion in Booker 

and its remedial opinion in Booker does dictate that the 

judge has additional freedom to impose a sentence that's 

different from what's described in the guidelines.

 JUSTICE BREYER: He could do this: He could 

set aside the guideline on the theory that the guideline 

itself is unreasonable, that is it doesn't properly take

account of sentencing. But suppose he doesn't do that. 

Then, if you take your view that there's a presumption 

in its favor and if it is the normal case, not an 

unusual case in any respect, how can he not apply the 

guideline?

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, I think we 

have to distinguish between what the job of the district 

court is and what the job of the appellate court is; and 

in this case, the Government is arguing for a 

presumption of reasonableness on appeal. Once the 

district judge has determined that the guidelines 

sentence aligns with his own application of the section 

3553(a) factors, our submission here is that a court of 

appeals can generally presume that that is a reasonable 

sentence. The defendant of course has the opportunity, 

or the Government if the Government has appealed, to 

show that that presumption is overcome.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But unless there is a way 

to calibrate the strength of the presumption, there's no 

clear way to distinguish the presumption from the 

mandate. The mandate is gone. You say yes, they 

consider other things. But unless we can calibrate the 

presumption in some way that says, you know, a mandate 

was force 60 and a presumption is a force 40, something 

like that, there's no way to tell the two apart in

practice.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, I'm not sure 

that that would be true even if what we were talking 

about was a direction to the district judge to presume 

that he would impose a guidelines sentence. But that's 

not what we're talking about. The district judge does 

not operate and does not have to operate under the 

position that we're arguing for with a presumption that 

the judge will impose a guidelines sentence unless 

persuaded otherwise. The judge's obligation is to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He doesn't have to do it 

unless he wants to be sure of being affirmed.

 MR. DREEBEN: I would think that what the 

judge wants to do is be sure that he's complied with his 

statutory obligations.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, perhaps I 

misunderstood Justice Souter's question, but I have this 

concern, and I thought it was his concern as well. At 

the appellate level, is the presumption something that 

can only be overcome by a clear and convincing showing 

or is it just an initial benchmark? We're playing with 

standards and words here.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, we are.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And when we talk about 

presumptions at the appellate level, that's actually a

little strange in any event. You usually talk about 

presumptions as assisting us in finding a fact.

 MR. DREEBEN: That's true, Justice Kennedy. 

But I think what it reflects at the appellate level is 

that the court of appeals enters the case with an 

attitude that, our job is to decide whether what the 

district judge did was reasonable. We can operate --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So we write that this is 

an additive thing?

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, I think that it's not so 

different from the court of appeals saying we can enter 

this case feeling pretty confident that we can affirm a 

guidelines sentence unless the person who challenges 

that shows us a good reason otherwise.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, is your view -- on 

your view, is the appellate court engaging in some kind 

of de novo review or is the appellate court supposed to 

engage in a review that it will disturb the sentence 

only if it is shown to be unreasonable?

 MR. DREEBEN: The latter, Justice Souter. 

And I think that in that regard there is a range of 

reasonable sentences that could be imposed based on a 

given set of facts.

you have that, two criminals, criminal defendants, with

the same identical background and everything else, one 

judge says, I think military service should be taken 

into account, so I'm going to depart from the guidelines 

by 3 years. The judge next door says, I don't think it 

should be taken into account so I'm going to impose the 

guideline sentence. Both cases are appealed. They're 

consolidated for argument. What is the court of appeals 

supposed to do? Uphold both of them?

 MR. DREEBEN: The court of appeals can 

uphold both of them if it concludes that the actual 

sentence that's imposed is reasonable. And in the 

second case that the Court is going to hear today the 

Government argues for a proportionality principle that 

should govern the review of sentencing.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What is reasonable is -- is 

not merely a sort of number within a spectrum. It seems 

to me that what is reasonable is a function in part of 

the reasons that are given. And in the Chief Justice's 

view, two diametrically opposed reasons are given for 

two different sentences. Does the, does the appellate 

court in his example say, well, I think reasonable 

people could go either way on that, so however it comes 

out it's fine on appellate review? Isn't that what the 

court would have to do in order to affirm both 

sentences, other things being equal?

MR. DWYER: You're right, Justice Souter, 

and I can't say that that would be the first choice of 

the Congress that enacted the Sentencing Reform Act.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't it clear that it 

would have been the last choice of the Congress?

 MR. DREEBEN: It is, and it's not the first 

choice of the Government, either. But it strikes me 

that it is something of an inevitability once this Court 

has declared that mandatory guidelines are impermissible 

under the Constitution if judicial factfinding --

JUSTICE ALITO: What does the Sixth 

Amendment have to do with the selection of the 

sentencing philosophy that is to be imposed? How can 

there be a Sixth Amendment violation if either the 

guidelines or our case law says military service is or 

is not a relevant factor? I don't see how that has 

anything to do with anything that you can get out of the 

Sixth Amendment.

 MR. DREEBEN: It probably does not, 

Justice Alito. But what happened in the first part of 

Booker is that the Court declared that the guidelines 

are advisory and advice. It's advice that can be 

accepted or rejected.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I know, but Booker says 

what we're trying to do is to come close to what

Congress wanted but not violate the Sixth Amendment.

 Now, what I think we're talking about now --

I think -- i mean, you sort of shed some -- you 

clarified something very well for me, which is that in 

this case we're talking about the situation where the 

district judge applies the guidelines sentence, and then 

what's the attitude of the court on appeal, and the 

attitude is going to be, well, the Sentencing Commission 

thinks it's okay, the judge thinks it's okay, okay, you 

have to -- you better show me a good reason to think to 

the contrary. Fine.

 But the interesting problem is the problem 

of the next case which you're now talking about, is, 

well, what happens if the district judge and when should 

be the district judge and how free should the district 

judge feel he is to depart from the guidelines sentence 

even if it's not an unusual case.

 MR. DREEBEN: Let me try to address that and 

try to address Justice Alito's point about the question 

of how much sentencing philosophy can be decreed by the 

sentencing commission or Congress before a Sixth 

Amendment problem arises.

 As I understand this Court's sequence of 

opinions from Apprendi leading up to the most recent 

decision in Cunningham, if the law establishes a level

of punishment that may be imposed based on the facts 

found by the jury and says to the judge, judge, you may 

not go above it unless you find a particular fact, that 

fact is subject to the Sixth Amendment rule that the 

Court has announced and must be found by a jury.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Or some fact, not 

necessarily a particular fact.

 MR. DREEBEN: Any fact at all, as a matter 

of fact is what the Court has said, although I 

understand that to mean facts pertaining to the offense 

and the offender, not facts about the world such as the 

prevalence of crime.

 Now, what that leads me to conclude is that 

in order to escape the bright line rule that's been 

announced in this sequence of cases, including Booker 

itself and most recently Cunningham, a judge must be 

able to look at the set of facts that the jury found, 

determine what level of punishment would be advised by, 

say, a guidelines system, and not be bound to impose 

that level of punishment if the judge feels that a 

different level of punishment is appropriate.

 If that is a correct understanding of what 

this Court has held, it necessarily implies that a judge 

does have a certain amount of freedom in an advisory 

guidelines system to disagree with what the Sentencing

Commission has found, give the judge's reasons, and then 

is subject to appellate review for the reasonableness of 

that explanation and, the Government submits, subject to 

a proportionality principle, so that the sentence that's 

imposed outside the guidelines is a reasonable one and 

not an arbitrary one.

 Now, if I'm wrong about that and it is not 

necessary for the court to have the legal freedom to be 

able to disagree with what the Sentencing Commission 

said, that would be very good from the Government's 

perspective. But as I understand the complementary 

rules that are established by Booker, what an advisory 

guidelines system requires is that the guidelines be 

treated as advice rather than mandate. So while the 

guidelines have determined that military service is not 

ordinarily relevant to the level of punishment, a judge 

may determine in a particular case that he disagrees.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, this is the 

hypothetical: Supposing a judge thinks military service 

is relevant, and he decides to impose a sentence a 

little below the guidelines. But then he says, I 

recognize that in this circuit there is a strong 

interest in uniformity and the court of appeals has 

adopted a rule where they will presume a within 

guidelines sentence is reasonable and will affirm in

those cases. And I think with respect to the court of 

appeals, I think I would be wise to impose the 

guidelines sentence, so I will do so even though my own 

judgment is that it should be slightly lower. What 

should the court of appeals do with such a sentence?

 MR. DREEBEN: I think the court of appeals 

should correct the judge on a mistaken apprehension of 

law, which is that the judge --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Should reverse the judge 

then, within a -- a within guidelines sentence?

 MR. DREEBEN: In the circumstance, 

Justice Stevens, I think that you put your finger on two 

different types of review. In the circumstance in which 

a district judge operates with what I'll call legal 

blinders on that prevent him from complying with --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No. He operates with 

total candor. He's saying exactly what he feels like 

saying.

 MR. DREEBEN: I'm hoping that it's a 

misunderstanding of what the court of appeals has said, 

because the court of appeals should not have told the 

judge you're obligated to impose a guideline sentence.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they didn't say 

you're obligated, but you can be pretty sure you'll be 

affirmed if you do impose within guidelines sentences.

MR. DREEBEN: Judges are still obligated to 

comply with 3553(a), which requires them to exercise 

discretion. Now if a judge decides I might as a 

personal matter if I were writing the guidelines write 

them differently, and I might give great weight to 

military service, but one of the things that I'm 

required to do under section 3553(a) is to consider the 

need to avoid unwarranted disparity between defendants 

who have been convicted of similar criminal conduct and 

have similar records. And therefore, I am going to 

moderate my own personal preference and not impose a 

significant outside the range sentence, in order to 

ensure that I fully have taken into account the fact 

that we are in a Federal system with 674 Federal 

district judges, and we cannot have all our own personal 

guidelines systems.

 Now if a judge does that, I don't think 

there's anything wrong with that. I think that judge 

has actually complied with --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the court of 

appeals does that? What if the court of appeals says 

we've got 10 district judges in this circuit, nine of 

them do not take military service into account, one 

does, and we think that's inequitable, doesn't serve the 

interest in uniformity. And so even though that one

judge says in the exercise of my discretion I'm going to 

depart, we're going to reverse that as unreasonable?

 MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, I think 

there's a difference between a sentence that varies from 

what other judges would do and a sentence that is 

unreasonable.

 If the sentence that is different from what 

other judges would do is not supported by a cogent and 

coherent explanation, and it is unduly productive of 

disparity because, say, it takes a guidelines range like 

this one, of 33 months to 41 months, and the judge says 

in my view military service means that this defendant 

gets probation.

 Or to take an example that's on the other 

side, suppose that the judge says this defendant 

actually didn't get any extra credit in his criminal 

history for his prior crime, but he has been convicted 

before of lying to the Government about his gun charges. 

I'm now going to take him up to the statutory maximum or 

near it and give him eight years. I think in those 

circumstances a court of appeals can and should say, 

hold on, this is a view that the district judge is 

entitled to take on the merits. He's entitled to give 

greater weight to that factor, whether it's aggravating 

or mitigating, than what the guidelines did, but not to

this extent, or we're going to be left with a system in 

which disuniformity is the main principle.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It's not that complicated. 

All that happens is the court of appeals says, look, in 

the case of bank robberies we've discovered about 33 

percent of the defendants in the typical case have been 

in the Army. And therefore, we think that just ordinary 

armed services is not a reason, ordinary armed --

services in the military is not a reason for a 

diminished sentence. That's all, period. Or they can 

say it the other way, the absence of a military service 

is a reason for having the higher sentence, put it any 

way you want. And by the way, district judge, if you 

disagree with that, we're going to reverse you because 

we think it's unreasonable. Okay. What about that?

 MR. DREEBEN: That to me sounds identical to 

the system that pre-existed Booker's holding.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It did. But is there 

anything in the Sixth Amendment that forbids that?

 MR. DREEBEN: This Court hasn't specifically 

addressed --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what do you think? 

Because I would think that if you're going to answer 

that question yes, you are saying that not even the 

court of appeals can try to assure a degree of fairness

among different defendants in respect to sentencing.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Breyer, I would 

like to be able to answer the question yes and say that 

courts of appeals can establish their own sub-legal 

rules as --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's not sub-legal rules. 

What it's called is precedent. What you do is you 

decide a case and you decide this is unfair, and then 

the thing that as a similar case comes along, is you 

decide it the same way. And if a district judge doesn't 

follow that, you reverse it.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, if do you 

that, what you have is each court of appeals functioning 

as a sentencing commission.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Exactly. You've simply 

substituted stare decisis and the necessity of the 

district court following circuit law for the guidelines. 

And --

MR. DREEBEN: Exactly.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If the guidelines are 

unconstitutional because they make facts automatically 

determinative, I assume that would be unconstitutional 

because it makes facts automatically determinative.

 MR. DREEBEN: I assume too under the 

rationale --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well then, in other words, 

the Constitution of the United States prevents the 

courts themselves from trying to assure that sentences 

who are -- that individuals who are in similar 

positions, commit similar crimes, will be treated in 

similar ways. That to me is possible, but of course 

I've been in dissent in these cases. But it seems to 

me --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So long as the jury 

determines the facts that make them similar.

 JUSTICE BREYER: We're back --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The problem here is what 

makes them similar.

 MR. DREEBEN: I understand this dialogue. 

And what we have --

(Laughter.)

 I too have been with the dissenters in these 

cases, and what I'm trying to argue for here is a set of 

principles that appellate courts can apply and that 

district courts can look to when sentencing, that will 

come as close as is reasonably possible to achieving 

Congress's aims in the Sentencing Reform Act without 

crossing over the bright line rule that this Court has 

announced --

terribly different it is than the normal review for 

abuse of discretion. I mean, you don't even need two 

judges in my earlier question. Let's say you have the 

same judge, and for three weeks every criminal defendant 

who comes before him he says, I think if you have 

military service, you should get a reduction. And then 

all of a sudden he says, I see you have military 

service, but I'm not going to give you a reduction. I 

mean, is he bound by some abuse of discretion standard 

to be a little bit consistent? And if that's the only 

type of appellate review we're talking about, to ensure 

some degree of consistency in how similar individuals 

are treated in similar cases, I don't see that it raises 

any concern.

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm 

not arguing for any proposition that I think would raise 

concern. I do think that a general tenet of abuse of 

discretion review is that the court of appeals can 

affirm a result that it would not necessarily have 

reached itself.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dreeben, may I ask 

you, please, to address a point that Mr. Cochran raised? 

I think you were very helpful in saying this presumption 

for the guidelines is how the court of appeals evaluates 

a district court sentence, that there is no presumption

that binds the district judge.

 But one of the main points that Mr. Cochran 

made in his presentation was the district judge has to 

give reasons. He -- this was just a summary paragraph 

at the end of the sentence hearing. He has to respond 

to what defendant presented. He has to respond to what 

the Government presented. There is an obligation 

stemming from subpart (c) to give reasons, and that's 

what he saw as the principal flaw in this sentence, that 

the court of appeals has used. Reasons weren't given 

for it.

 MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, I don't 

think there was anything problematic with what this 

district judge did. As Your Honor noted, this was a 

sentence that was imposed after a lengthy sentencing 

hearing in which the court engaged in a dialogue with 

defense counsel about the three bases and the exclusive 

bases on which defense counsel asked for a downward 

departure. The judge at least four times in this 

transcript brought up Section 3553, recognizing that the 

judge was well aware of his obligation to imply the 

purposes of sentencing and the factors that were 

presented to him. Now he did that and he made comments 

along the way that indicate why he did not find physical 

condition, military service, or asserted vulnerability

in prison to be reasons that would justify giving this 

defendant a lower sentence.

 And in his ultimate explanation, though it 

is brief, he pointed to two of the Section 3553 factors 

explicitly. He pointed to the seriousness of the 

offense and he pointed to the need for public 

protection.

 Now if you look at the legal obligations 

that the judge had under Section 3553(c) to explain 

himself, the statute actually sets up a hierarchy of 

three different levels of explanation. First, in any 

case the judge is to state the reasons for the sentence. 

Second, if the sentencing range is greater than 24 

months, the judge is supposed to explain the particular 

reason for giving a sentence at one end or another end 

of the range. And finally, if the sentence is outside 

the range, the judge is to give the specific reason for 

a sentence outside the range. That statutory framework 

makes it entirely plausible to say that if a judge 

imposes a guideline sentence and explains, I see no 

reason not to impose a guideline sentence, he has met 

his burden of explanation without having to respond 

literally and in sequence to each argument that the 

defendant has made.

The district judge is reviewed under an abuse of 

discretion standard, which I take it means there's a 

presumption he got it right. Is that correct? There's 

a presumption the district judge sentence is correct?

 MR. DREEBEN: Well, Justice Stevens, our 

position is more complicated than that, because within a 

guidelines range if a sentence is imposed, the 

Government --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Why shouldn't there be 

also the same presumption when it is outside the 

guidelines range?

 MR. DREEBEN: Because sentences that are 

outside the guidelines range are more likely to be the 

cause of or a source of unwarranted disparity than a 

sentence within the range. And that is why that if the 

court of appeals is interested in fulfilling what Booker 

said the role of the court of appeals is, which is to 

iron out sentencing differences, there is more 

reason for the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, do you think the 

interest in uniformity, in same sentences across the 

board is stronger than the interest in getting the 

correct sentence for the particular defendant who's in 

court at the time?

correct sentence usually.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, there isn't. But if 

you say the district judge has broad discretion, which 

he does, and the review is under abuse of discretion, 

why should there not always be a presumption that the 

district judge got it right?

 MR. DREEBEN: Because there are more legal 

elements that go into sentencing and sentencing review 

than just those that you've named, Justice Stevens. 

Section 3553(a) itself, which is the guidepost for 

review, mandates that the district court consider the 

guidelines, consider the policy --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but it's sort of like 

findings of fact. They must take into consideration all 

sorts of aspects of the case, and you have a strong 

presumption that the findings of fact are accurate. Why 

don't you have a strong presumption that the ultimate 

judgment on the sentence is also accurate?

 MR. DREEBEN: What happens when a sentence 

is imposed outside the range is that there is a greater 

risk of infringing the main purpose of the Sentencing 

Reform Act, which was to avoid unwarranted disparities; 

and in contrast to a sentence within the range which 

does not merely run that risk to the same degree, a 

sentence outside the range may well. It's different

from what the sentencing commission with its expertise 

and its experience has recommended as the appropriate 

sentence, given those facts.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're -- I mean, 

this is a self fulfilling prophecy. You're saying if 

you don't comply with the guidelines, you're not going 

to have uniformity. Well, I -- my goodness. Is that 

consistent with the notion that the guidelines are 

advisory?

 MR. DREEBEN: I wouldn't put it as strongly 

as that, Justice Scalia. What I would say is that the 

further that a sentence diverges from the guidelines 

range, the greater the possibility of unwarranted 

disparity; and as a result of that, a court of appeals 

should look more critically at the reasons that the 

district court gave and ensure that the constellation of 

reasons and facts that's presented is not so likely to 

be a disproportionate sentence than --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's just 

inconsistent with the notion which I think is correct, 

that the district judge can simply disagree with the 

basic -- basic reasons of the commission, can simply 

disagree with the fact that the commission considers 

white collar crime, for example, something that should 

justify incarceration.

MR. DREEBEN: But Justice Scalia, 

reasonableness review connotes that the court of appeals 

will review the reasons that the district court gave for 

that disagreement.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So doesn't your presumption 

argument come down to an argument for a sufficiently 

comprehensive statement of reasons, with a more 

extensive statement required the further the court gets 

from the guidelines? Isn't that what it boils down to?

 MR. DREEBEN: It does for an out of range 

sentence, Justice Souter. I think that for a sentence 

within the range, the judge's statement that I have 

considered the guidelines range and I think it's 

appropriate does explain why that judge has given the 

sentence that he's given. It's consistent with the 

statute and it's consistent with the Constitution. Now 

when --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is there -- may I interrupt 

you? Because your time is getting short.

 Is there a difference between a presumption 

of reasonableness to the guidelines on the one hand and 

a rule that says the further you get from them, you can 

get as far as you want to, but the further you get from 

them, the more extensive your explanation has to be?

 Is there a distinction between those two,

two rules?

 MR. DREEBEN: There is a distinction between 

them but I think they are complementary rules and in the 

next case the Government will argue for a presumption 

that is precisely what you have articulated, 

Justice Souter. A greater and more extensive and more 

persuasive explanation is needed the further that you go 

from the guidelines range.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or presumably the 

further the facts suggest that you ought to depart from 

the guidelines range? If you've got a submission here 

18 compelling reasons, you shouldn't follow the 

guidelines, and you get one sentence from the district 

court saying -- you know -- I followed the guidelines, 

presumably that would be the same as a significant 

departure without further justification?

 MR. DREEBEN: It wouldn't be identical but I 

agree with you, Mr. Chief Justice, that a sentence 

within the guidelines can be unreasonable if there is a 

compelling case for a sentence outside the range because 

the guidelines simply don't fit in that circumstance.

 The sentencing commission itself recognized 

that the guidelines were generalizations; they carved 

out a heartland in the language of the sentencing 

commission's first set of guidelines, and that there

sentences.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is the system that you're 

describing any different for mandatory guidelines that 

are subject to departure when the district judge finds a 

significant reason, which was what mandatory guidelines 

had?

 MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Scalia. It is 

quite --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wherein is it different?

 MR. DREEBEN: It is different precisely on 

the area that, that you yourself articulated. The judge 

can disagree with the sentencing guidelines and 

determine that on the basis of the facts that the jury 

found, the judge would impose a different sentence, and 

that conclusion is then subject for reasonableness 

review and we submit based on a proportionality 

principle.

established in Booker. That in and of itself shows why 

there cannot be a presumption of reasonableness on 

appeal. Because you are holding the presumption to a 

different standard at that point. It is not a 

reasonableness across the board. You are putting the 

burden on one the parties, most likely the defendant, to 

come forward and explain why the presumption should be 

rebutted.

 That flies in the face with the across the 

board reasonableness this Court set forth in Booker.

 The guidelines are fraught with disparity. 

That why is they are advisory. That's why they can only 

be advisory. And the district courts must be allowed to 

look at them, to see them, to consider them, but 

ultimately to impose a sentence outside them for valid

Clearly the judge was rooted in the 

guidelines and that's why he gave a sentence of 33 

months at the low end.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The, the judge also 

pointed out that the jury made certain findings and he 

thought he was bound by them; that is, the defendant 

protested his independence, and the jury had found him 

guilty of false statements.

 MR. COCHRAN: That's correct. That's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The judge was bound by 

those.

 MR. COCHRAN: That's correct, Your Honor, 

but interestingly the court found very dubious the 

additional information regarding the cross-reference. 

And on page 87 of the joint appendix, the court states 

it was not able to evaluate the seriousness of that 

other investigation; and yet that was the 

cross-reference that doubled his guidelines sentence.

 We would ask the Court to rule in this case 

that the presumption of reasonableness cannot be 

accorded to the guidelines.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Cochran, you've 

started out by saying there were two places in the 

record that you thought showed the judge was bound by 

the guidelines. 49, what was the other one?

were inappropriate; and I suggest that that is a, a 

giving of greater weight and too much so in this case.

that a presumption cannot be accorded to the guidelines, 

that his sentence was unreasonable in this case, and 

that his case be returned for resentencing. Thank you.
