CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear 

argument next in Case 09-5327, Holland v. Florida. 

Mr. Scher. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD G. SCHER 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. SCHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

It is undisputed that Petitioner was not 

provided notice that the State supreme court had denied 

his postconviction appeal and had issued its mandate, 

with the result being that his AEDPA statute of 

limitations expired. The very day he learned this, 

Petitioner immediately prepared a pro se habeas petition 

and filed it within 24 hours. Before this, Petitioner 

had taken --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How do -- what in the 

record shows us that the failure to tell him that by the 

lawyer was anything other than negligence? What in the 

record suggests that the lawyer, just as many lawyers 

do, forgot to call the client, forgot to send him 

something? What shows that this is more than 

negligence? 

MR. SCHER: Well, first of all, we have what

the Eleventh Circuit characterized Mr. Collins's conduct 

as, which was gross negligence. And what we have here 

is a confluence --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I'm trying to find 

the basis for that finding. 

MR. SCHER: We have a repeated pattern. For 

example, first of all we have to go back in terms of what 

happened in State court. First we have Mr. Collins's 

assurances to Mr. Holland that he would in fact file his 

Federal -- or was aware of this --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but --

MR. SCHER: I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what his intent 

was. 

MR. SCHER: Correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: People say I'm going to 

do something, and they fail to do it often because 

something else comes up, because something has happened. 

That doesn't show intentionality in -- the failure to 

act doesn't necessarily prove that it was intentional. 

MR. SCHER: Well -- well, in terms of that 

what we have here, for example, is Mr. Collins was given 

two opportunities -- or the record shows that there were 

two opportunities for Mr. Collins to provide answers to 

these very questions. The most significant of those

responses was -- was in the Federal district court where 

the Federal district judge in fact issued a show cause 

order to Mr. Collins asking him to respond specifically 

to Mr. Holland's allegations. And in that response Mr. 

Collins completely ignored all of Mr. Holland's 

allegations. He never denied that -- being instructed 

to file the petition. He never denied that he had in 

fact informed Mr. Holland that he wouldn't -- that he 

would file the petition. He never denied any of the 

allegations with regard to the fact that Mr. Holland 

wanted that Federal habeas petition filed on time. He 

just went on to address --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that -- but that's 

the case in every case where -- where the lawyer is 

negligent and doesn't do something that -- that should 

have been done. 

MR. SCHER: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He has assured the client, 

I will take care of your case, and he doesn't do it. 

MR. SCHER: Well, here we have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's all that happened 

here. 

MR. SCHER: This -- this goes beyond the 

case of mere, garden-variety negligence that some of the 

courts have -- have addressed, because here we have a

combination of not only a failure -- we have the failure 

to notify Mr. Holland that the State supreme court has in 

fact denied its opinion, despite repeated instructions 

from Holland to Mr. Collins that he file his petition. 

Mr. Holland wrote --

JUSTICE ALITO: The facts here -- the facts 

here are quite extreme, but I am troubled by where you 

think the line should be drawn. If it is just mere 

negligence, would that be enough for equitable tolling? 

MR. SCHER: No, courts -- and this Court in 

Lawrence has held, for example, that mere negligence is 

not sufficient. What we have here certainly is 

suggestive --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well -- the difference 

between mere negligence and gross negligence -- one of the 

things I remember most clearly from torts in law school 

is that that's pretty -- that's an ephemeral 

distinction. But that's the one you one you think we 

should draw, between mere -- if it's gross negligence, 

then there's equitable tolling; if it's mere negligence, 

it's not? 

MR. SCHER: Well, we know certainly that the 

floor from -- from cases from this Court and from other 

courts is this mere or garden-variety negligence. But 

when you get to other factors --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why should -- why should 

that be? Two cases. Two criminal defendants. One 

spends a lot of time trying to find the most competent 

lawyer he can, and he does. He finds a highly skilled 

lawyer, who makes one little mistake and it's 

negligence. 

The other doesn't care. He gets a lawyer 

that's really incompetent, and the lawyer is grossly 

negligent. 

Now, you would be penalizing the client who 

exercised the most diligence under your rule. I don't 

understand the -- the justice of that. It seems to me 

that the first client should be better off, not worse. 

Now, maybe this is for your friend on the 

other side to answer as well, but I'm not sure, even 

following Justice Alito's initial line of questioning, 

we can distinguish between gross and mere 

negligence, that -- that it's even fair that we do so. 

MR. SCHER: Well, this Court --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't mean to interrupt 

his line of questioning, but it seems to be consistent 

with it. 

MR. SCHER: This and other courts have --

have been able to draw that line, and, of course you have 

to look at the specifics of each particular case,

because not only --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But what's the -- what's 

the point? What's the justice in doing that? 

MR. SCHER: Well, the way --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than just limit 

the number of cases in which we are going to set aside 

convictions? 

MR. SCHER: Well, in some circumstances, 

courts have just said, unfortunately you lose, your 

attorney didn't commit -- it was just a mere mistake. 

But what we have here, of course, is not -- we don't 

have a mere mistake; we have a confluence of these 

particular factors. And I think one of the more salient 

points that distinguishes Mr. Holland's case, for 

example, from Lawrence and from the situation in 

Coleman, is that Mr. Holland tried to rid himself of Mr. 

Collins on numerous occasions while this case was in 

State court. In Lawrence and in Coleman, the 

petitioners were not allowed to be free of their 

lawyers; they accepted those lawyers’ representation --

they accepted their representation and the acts and 

omissions that occurred in Lawrence and in Coleman were 

attributed to -- to the petitioners in those cases. 

Here, however, by contrast, Mr. Holland did 

everything he could -- he could, to be -- reasonably, to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you -- are you 

suggesting that there should be a different standard for 

those habeas petitioners who are -- whose counsel is 

appointed for them by the State or by the Federal 

government, as opposed to just a lawyer they hire? 

That's what I'm hearing you say. 

MR. SCHER: No, and I didn't mean to suggest 

that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So if the 

standard is going to be the same -- I -- I go back to 

Justice Alito's question, which is, the Eleventh Circuit 

is saying negligence/gross negligence, the line is too 

fine to draw. But there is a difference in a line 

between negligence, however one defines it, and an 

intentional, bad faith, dishonest, conflicted 

malfeasance. 

MR. SCHER: Correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Why isn't 

that a more workable line, given that you can't have 

equitable tolling without exceptional circumstances? 

MR. SCHER: Correct enough, but I think 

each -- well, certainly those were some of the 

individual factors that the Eleventh Circuit discussed 

when saying gross negligence isn't enough. I think in

Mr. Holland's case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You haven't argued why 

not, is what I'm saying to you. If exceptional 

circumstances has to mean something that really makes 

something exceptional, why is negligence of any variant 

exceptional? 

MR. SCHER: Because when you look at, for 

example, in this particular case, when we are talking 

about an exceptional circumstance, you’re talking 

about a lot of times -- and courts have done this --

is the confluence of what the attorney did or didn't do 

versus what the petitioner did. 

So we have, of course -- along the lines of 

the extraordinary circumstances here, we have 

Petitioner's diligence. And in some respects they 

dovetail. And I think what the Eleventh Circuit did was 

say we don't care what the Petitioner did; we don't 

really care what the lawyer did; anything the lawyer did 

unless the lawyer was mentally ill or had divided 

loyalties, then that’s -- those are the only factors that 

were going to be considered in terms of equitable 

tolling. 

But that is -- that is antithetical to 

the very nature of equity. Here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We've never held that

equitable tolling for anything is available under this 

statute of limitations here. 

MR. SCHER: That's correct. This Court, 

however --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And why should it be? It 

seems to me, this is not like the ordinary statute of 

limitations, where it says, you know, the statute is five 

years, and courts make all sorts of necessary exceptions 

to the five years. But here you have a statute that --

that provides exceptions, for example, “the limitation 

period shall run from the latest of the date on which 

the impediment to filing an application created by State 

action in violation … is removed.” In other words, we’re 

going to toll it for that particular event. 

“The date on which the constitutional right 

asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme 

Court” -- we’re going to toll it for that. 

“The date on which the factual predicate of 

the claim or claims presented could have been discovered 

through exercise of due diligence.” 

Many of -- many of the equitable tolling 

holdings involved precisely that. We’ll toll it since 

you couldn't have found out about the violation within 

the statutory period. 

But all of these things are handled already

in 2244(d). Why should we -- why should we assume the 

right to create some additional exceptions from the --

from the 1-year period? 

MR. SCHER: Well, with all due respect, I 

don't concur with the premise that those four particular 

subsections of 2244(d) are exceptions or -- or are 

tolling provisions. Indeed, this Court in Jimenez said 

that those four, (a), (b), (c) and (d), are --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many circuits have 

said that there is equitable tolling? 

MR. SCHER: Eleven circuits -- all of the 

circuits, and the only circuit that hasn't held that is 

the D.C. Circuit where it remains an open question. So 

all of the circuits that have addressed --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then it's a question of 

what are exceptional circumstances and whether it has to 

be something deliberate, which is what the -- as I 

understand it, the Michigan Court of Appeals said --

yes, if it was bad faith -- if it was a lie, a 

deception --

MR. SCHER: Correct. And, in fact --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So they’re drawing the 

line between intentional and -- and without intending 

but just being careless. 

MR. SCHER: Correct. And, certainly here, I

think we have what they deemed to be gross negligence, 

which I think certainly has an element of, let's say, for 

example, to use the term "recklessness." I mean, we've 

got six or seven circuits which have addressed this 

particular issue in terms of this line between mere 

negligence and -- and something more than that, and those 

circuits have all -- in the 13 or 14 years since AEDPA 

has been around, all been able to effectively deal with 

these particular cases on their particular facts. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: We have a case this 

afternoon involving an opinion of ours named McNally, 

which held that there's no such thing as a fraud action 

for a right to honest services. How many of the courts 

of appeals had held that there did exist such a right 

when we held that there didn't in McNally? 

MR. SCHER: I'm not familiar. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Every single court of 

appeals that had faced it had held that there was such a 

right. So the mere fact that you have 11 court of 

appeals that have found that they have extraordinary 

power -- judges like to find that they have power -- and 

that doesn't necessarily make it right. 

MR. SCHER: Well -- and I --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Of course, that also 

assumes that McNally was correctly decided --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- and I don’t think it was. 

May I ask you another question --

MR. SCHER: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- prompted by Justice 

Kennedy's question? Have any of the circuits taken a 

look at the probable merit of the underlying claim in 

evaluating the issue? 

MR. SCHER: In this particular case or in 

another case? 

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, not in this particular 

case. But Justice Kennedy says it's equally unjust to 

the client whether it's negligence or gross negligence, 

and I'm just asking whether in any of the reviews of this 

issue, that you are familiar with, have they sometimes 

looked at the probable merit of the claim, and if there 

was merit, why, you were more disturbed about attorney 

negligence, whereas if it's a frivolous claim, they 

wouldn't be. But do you know if any of them take a look 

at that at all? 

MR. SCHER: There are certainly some cases 

that address the tolling and then, of course, address the 

merits of the petition. I don't know that there are any 

that link the two. But, certainly, if you have, for 

example -- the Respondent has argued that the floodgates

are just going open, but certainly one of the -- one of 

the ways that a Federal district court can deal with 

this and has dealt with this in the past 13 years is to 

look at the petition. And if the petition raises 

something that’s so palpably meritless, you don't even 

need to get to anything about whether it’s -- just 

dismiss the petition because, of course, the vast 

majority of cases that AEDPA addresses in this particular 

chapter are noncapital cases and are pro se cases. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I looked in the brief to 

see if there was reference to the merits, underlying 

merits of the case. Can you just tell me very quickly 

what the key arguments are, if we ever reach the merits? 

MR. SCHER: In the Petitioner's case? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. 

MR. SCHER: He had -- well, there were a 

number of issues that he raised on direct appeal. There 

was issues regarding counsel. For example, I know in 

the postconviction motion, one of the key issues was he 

had a what's termed in Florida “a Nixon issue,” which is 

where counsel conceded some of the elements of the 

crime. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I shouldn't probably 

take your time with that. I will look at the State 

record.

MR. SCHER: But -- but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Scher, one point that 

you didn't mention, but you did I thought stress it in 

your brief, was that counsel here said: Oh, the 

deadline had run even before I was engaged, even before 

I was appointed to represent this man, so there was 

nothing that I could do for him, because the time had 

already expired. 

MR. SCHER: That's correct, 

Justice Ginsburg. What happened is that that particular 

explanation came up after the fact. I think what's 

significant about that, number one, is that his 

explanations have been a moving target to a large 

extent. But what's even more important is that none of 

that information was ever imparted to Mr. Holland while 

the case was pending. 

While Mr. Collins was providing assurances 

and reassurances to Mr. Holland -- about, don't 

worry, your State postconviction motion will be filed 

on time, your Federal rights will be honored, everything 

will be done, your appeal will be taken, once we are 

done in the Florida Supreme Court we will go off to the 

Federal district court -- at no time did Mr. Collins ever 

say: We've got a big problem here; the statute may have 

run, and so we need to start thinking in advance of ways

to deal with this. 

For example, if Mr. Collins truly 

believed that the statute had already run, the day the 

Florida Supreme Court issued that decision, he should 

have been in Federal court filing something right away. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Could you just tell me in a 

sentence or two what test you think we should apply for 

equitable tolling? What is necessary in order for there 

to be equitable tolling? 

MR. SCHER: Your Honor, I think the -- the 

test is the test that this Court has applied, which is 

in Pace and in Lawrence, which is extraordinary 

circumstances coupled with diligence. I think under 

those particular -- coupled with diligence, the 

Petitioner's diligence. 

JUSTICE ALITO: What does "extraordinary 

circumstances" mean? 

MR. SCHER: It's -- it’s a case-by-case type of 

issue. It's because it's an equitable remedy. It's not 

something that’s susceptible to rigid rules, which of 

course is the problem with the Eleventh Circuit's 

categorical exclusion of a particular large chunk of 

misconduct on the part of the attorney. But certainly 

here, where we have extraordinary circumstances, we have 

lack of notice to the Petitioner that his State court

these circumstances you have this confluence of events. 

And I think what makes this case -- what sets this case 

apart from the other ones that this Court has seen and 

that certainly other courts have seen is, for example, 

it's extraordinary -- or it was diligent for Mr. Holland 

to have asked the Florida Supreme Court on two occasions 

to rid himself of Collins, and he asked to proceed pro se. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The client -- this client 

was sort of the pesky client, but apparently knew a lot 

more about AEDPA than most people generally do. I mean, 

AEDPA's not exactly an ordinary term. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And had a lot of time to 

devote to it. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and suppose you have a 

client who is just bewildered. He doesn't know AEDPA; 

he doesn't know Federal court. Why should he be in any 

worse position than this client? 

MR. SCHER: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me it would be 

the other way around. This fellow knew enough that, if 

he had really just done a little bit more, he would have 

-- well, he tried to file a petition, but he might have 

done a little bit more. 

MR. SCHER: Well, I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the uninformed client,

the ignorant client, could never have approached this. 

I don't know why he shouldn't be more protected than 

your client, which goes back to Justice Alito's question. 

I'm not sure how we draw this line. 

MR. SCHER: I think the problem we have here 

with Mr. Holland is that the more diligent he was, the 

more the Respondent and the lower courts have said he 

should have done. And so he did X, Y, and Z; they say 

you should have done A, B, and C. 

But what I think is -- is significant here 

is he was stuck with this lawyer. He tried to get rid of 

the lawyer. The State filed motions saying you can't --

not only can you not fire him, you can't file a pro se 

motion because you are represented by the lawyer. So all 

Mr. Holland hears from the courts is that: You can't speak 

to us and we can't speak to you. So he's stuck. 

And then, of course, he's writing to the 

Florida Supreme Court clerk begging for information, and 

in fact in footnote 11 of the brief --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he never asked -- he 

wrote to the clerk, but he never asked to be informed 

when the judgment came down. 

MR. SCHER: Well, what we have, Your Honor, 

is if you look on page 11, in footnote 11, Mr. Holland 

wrote a letter to the Florida Supreme Court clerk,

toward the end of which he says: "I'm not trying to get 

on your nerves. I would just like to know exactly what 

is happening with my case on appeal to the Supreme Court 

of Florida." 

So we certainly have in the clerk's office 

-- and, again, that was on page 11, footnote 11. It's 

also at the Joint Appendix at 146 to 147. 

What we have here is Petitioner putting the 

Florida Supreme Court on explicit notice that he is 

having a problem with his lawyer, and further -- earlier 

in that particular letter, he apologizes to the clerk, 

saying: I'm sorry to pester you with these -- with these 

requests, but if I had a lawyer who was responding to my 

letters and who was listening to me and who would send 

me the documentations, I wouldn't have to be bothering 

you, but this is the situation that I'm in. 

And then, of course, he tries to not only have 

Mr. Collins substituted, but he asks to go pro se. 

That's an extraordinary circumstance. And what makes it 

even further, more extraordinary is the State coming in 

and saying, no, you can't not only do that, but you are 

not even allowed to file the paperwork asking to do 

that. And, in fact, when Mr. Holland did file his pro se 

petition in Federal district court, the State moved to 

strike it because he was represented by -- by counsel.

And so --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this case 

different if the filing error -- I understand there was 

a lot going on, but if the lawyer just miscalculated the 

days and was off by one day, this case comes out the 

other way in your view, right? 

MR. SCHER: I think not only under my -- I 

think, certainly, courts have -- have discussed this, that 

that's -- that's just an unfortunate mere mistake. But I 

think certainly we don't have that under the facts of 

this case. There has never been any suggestion that 

there was any miscalculation. We just have 

complete abandonment by -- by the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't -- you say --

you say “complete abandonment.” But this lawyer filed a 

whole lot of things on behalf of this client. He missed 

a very critical thing, the Federal habeas filing. But 

it's not abandonment of a client in the sense of not 

doing anything for the client. 

So it goes back to my beginning question, 

which is, where is the line drawn between the types of 

negligence and what the circuit suggested, which is some 

sort of intentional malfeasance? 

MR. SCHER: And I didn't mean to suggest --

when I -- when I used the word "abandonment," I'm -- I'm

referring to, of course, in terms of abandonment with 

regard to preserving -- enforcing the assurances that 

Collins had made with respect to filing the petition. 

And, of course, he also had told -- that --

Mr. Holland that he would inform him of the Florida 

Supreme Court's decision, because that, of course, is 

the triggering date. 

We have Mr. Holland, who had already been --

you know, asked his lawyer, you know, please file 

certain issues in my case and please keep me informed. 

When those two promises and assurances were not kept by 

the lawyer, Mr. Holland at that point has reason to be 

concerned that the additional promise, which is, I will 

file on time, was not going to be honored. 

And so Mr. Holland embarked on a series of 

diligent steps in order to get some information, but he 

didn't know where to turn. And, then, of course, for 

example, he writes to the clerk's office of the supreme 

court. Sometimes they send him information; sometimes 

they tell him to send a check. 

He doesn't know. He is not getting any 

consistency, and he's certainly not getting any response 

from his attorney. 

Then he files these motions in the State 

supreme court, which are opposed by the State as

nullities because he is represented by counsel. He then 

writes to the Florida Supreme Court saying, can you give 

me the information about your Web site -- maybe I can have 

some friends look up this case. Because, of course, he 

knows at this point that there is a problem, and he 

knows that the triggering date for the filing in the 

Federal petition is the denial by the Florida Supreme 

Court and the issuance of the mandate. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you are -- you 

seem, from what you just said, to be relying on a 

distinction between paid counsel, who is just as 

careless, and court-appointed counsel, because in the 

one case the client had picked that attorney, and in the 

other case, the client was given this attorney by the 

State. So I think you’re suggesting that the State has 

some responsibility when it provides the counsel. 

But before you said, no, your answer would 

be the same if you were not making a distinction between 

court-appointed and paid counsel. 

MR. SCHER: I think the -- the distinction 

that I was making -- I'm not saying that there's a 

difference in terms of paid or appointed counsel, but 

here where you have appointed counsel, I think one of 

the extraordinary factors is the State coming in and --

and moving to strike these pro se pleadings, telling

Mr. -- sending a signal to Mr. Holland that you are 

stuck with Collins, you can't speak to the supreme 

court, and the supreme court can't speak to you. 

Everything has to be funneled through your lawyer. 

And, of course, the ironic thing is that, had 

Mr. Holland been permitted to proceed pro se, he would 

have gotten copied with the decision by the supreme 

court of Florida. He would have gotten copied with the 

mandate. And then he would have known when the mandate 

issued. 

And as we know, when he found out -- I mean, 

the other extraordinary factor here is that when he 

found out that this happened, he prepared that petition 

that day and mailed it the next day. This is not 

somebody who sat on his rights. He didn't start 

complaining and writing letters and bemoaning his 

situation. He took action, which also distinguishes 

this case from a number of others. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess I understand 

what the cases have said. I -- I have trouble 

understanding why that should make a difference, why 

that should be so pertinent, why he should be in better 

shape than somebody who says: Look, I don't know

difference. In Lawrence, this Court had said Lawrence 

was out of luck because it's not like he asked for 

another lawyer or asked to proceed pro se. And so 

Holland -- and so Lawrence was stuck.

course of your argument, how -- how often do these 

deadlines missed (a) in capital cases and (b) in AEDPA 

cases? Do you have any statistics on that, or can you 

tell us from your experience? 

MR. MAKAR: I can tell you anecdotally the 

attorneys that handle these cases in Florida, that the 

equitable tolling issue comes up with some regularity. 

I’m aware of three cases just in Jacksonville where I 

live where the district judge there has had evidentiary 

hearings and has looked at these equitable tolling issues. 

In Florida, we have 394 individuals on death 

row, and those cases are at various stages in the 

litigation. So there is a certain amount of that that 

goes on. 

As to the noncapital cases, we know that 

the system is flooded with habeas petitions. Obviously, 

most of those are unrepresented. But there still is, in 

those cases -- a study I saw recently, a 2007 study from 

Vanderbilt University, that about 20 percent of those 

cases are dismissed on statute of limitations grounds. 

I’m inferring from that that there is some equitable 

tolling action going on there, but the specific amount 

we’re not sure of. But certainly in both the capital 

and noncapital area, this is an issue. 

And if I could get to the standard here,

then I guess we’re at a discussion of is this one of 

those cases? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, two responses. Number 

one, we do not believe that equitable tolling was 

intended by Congress under this complex statute of 

limitations for all the reasons set out in our brief. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So that’s earthquake, 

fire, flood, et cetera? 

MR. MAKAR: Exactly. And it relates to the 

same result, it seems -- to the same result as this Court 

came to in Beggerly and Brockamp, where the -- if 

Congress intended that to be the case, that's the case. 

JUSTICE ALITO: What if the lawyer lies to 

the client and the client says my time is running out, 

have you filed my -- my Federal habeas petition, and the 

lawyer says, yes, I filed it and here it is, and it has 

a -- a forged date stamp on it? No equitable tolling 

there? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, under our position that 

Congress intended to draw a very clear line, no. If 

the -- if the Court assumes or decides there is some 

sort of equitable tolling, then that's a different case, 

and -- and in those situations where there’s something 

beyond the incompetence of the lawyer. And that's our rule. 

If the Court decides there is equitable tolling or

assumes it exists, it has to be that the rule that the 

incompetence of the postconviction counsel cannot be a 

basis for relief. 

That's what this Court has essentially said 

in Lawrence and also in Coleman, and also what Congress 

inferentially said in -- in 2254(i). 

So, under those circumstances, here our rule 

works because you don't get into those gradations of 

negligence, you know, is it gross negligence? Well, 

how gross? And the bottom line here in this particular case, 

of course -- and the Court has asked these questions 

here -- is what really happened in this case? All you 

had was a Lawrence error, which was --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why should it matter? 

It's certainly unusual. Isn't that what we are after, one, 

is he diligent? Answer, yes, he has been diligent. 

Two, is it extraordinary? I would think it 

was fairly extraordinary that a person writes these letters 

to counsel and so forth, then the -- the thing isn't 

filed. Is that extraordinary or not? 

Whether it was his fault, whether he himself 

was kidnapped. I mean, maybe it wasn't the counsel's 

fault. You can imagine a lot of circumstances. But the 

question, I would think, is, is it extraordinary and is 

it fair?

authority to do this, would it make sense to say 

that the State is going to be subject to equitable 

tolling on a rather broad standard -- we’re going to 

give equitable tolling often -- unless the State has 

attorney discipline procedures, so that this happens 

only once and then the attorney can no longer practice 

in the Federal courts? 

MR. MAKAR: I suppose as a matter of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Obviously, what we’re 

looking for is some sort of a rule to keep the deadline, 

and if we’re going to accommodate your friend on the 

other side, to have -- to have some rule about 

exceptional -- exceptional cases.

-- but in the end, what we have here is garden-variety 

attorney negligence miscalculating and missing a 

deadline. The --

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't there at least one 

additional thing here? Holland filed a request -- a pro 

se request to be relieved of Collins's representation, 

and that was rejected by the -- that was rejected by the 

court because he was pro se. And therefore he couldn't 

ask -- he couldn't file something himself?

because there’s a misconception going on here. In the 

Florida Supreme Court postconviction process, Collins 

-- I'm sorry, Holland twice filed motions to remove 

Collins. Importantly, Holland never asked to go pro se. 

That is incorrect. If you look at Joint Appendix 134 

and 149 -- those are the two pro se filings that Holland 

made here. In both of those, he said: I'm having a 

conflict with my lawyer. My lawyer won't do what I want 

him to do; I want a new lawyer. 

And that's all he said: I want a new lawyer. 

He never --

JUSTICE ALITO: Was that denied on the 

ground that he was pro se? 

MR. MAKAR: The first motion was stricken. 

It was then denied because he was represented by counsel 

at that point. Keep in mind, this is in the State 

postconviction process. This is not where the Federal 

AEDPA deadline and so forth is being kicked about. In 

fact, there is really no discussion whatsoever about 

what the actual deadline to file this petition was at 

all in the record. 

The only time Holland asked to go pro se in 

any court filing is after he filed the pro se petition 

in Federal court -- the untimely one. He then shortly 

thereafter filed an emergency motion to relieve Collins,

JUSTICE ALITO: What I don't understand is, 

how can a -- how can a client request to have -- to be 

relieved of representation, if the client can't file 

that motion pro se? I understand the other things, but 

I don't understand why -- how -- how you can deny the 

request to get rid of this lawyer? Unless he has to 

have the lawyer file the motion for him? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. MAKAR: No, I think that certainly the 

filing of the motion, I think perhaps it was -- it shouldn't 

have been stricken the first time, but the court then on the 

merits denied it the second time. And keep in mind -- I 

forget who alluded to it -- this has been somewhat of an 

unusual case from the outset, in that if you look at the 

three Florida Supreme Court opinions that have been 

issued in this case, it shows that at the first trial 

Holland absented himself from the -- absented himself 

from the trial and he had to watch on circuit --

closed-circuit TV because he was being very difficult. 

And then in the second trial, we had two 

Faretta hearings amounting to hundreds of pages in which 

the Florida Supreme Court then said, well, he wants to 

represent himself, but he can't conduct himself properly 

and so forth. And also there's the issue of his -- his

-- there’s a mental issue there as well, that he has 

raised on appeal as well. 

So the court -- the Florida courts are sort 

of put in this difficult posture of saying, we want you 

to have counsel, we need you to have counsel because we 

want you to have effective representation, but then 

throughout the process here it's been a difficult, 

difficult number of decades, essentially, in this 

situation. So I think it's an unfair characterization 

to say that the Florida courts and also the Office of 

Attorney General who -- who routinely moves to 

strike these -- it's not because we're trying to deny 

anyone's day in court. It's because you have a lawyer 

and they have to speak to the lawyer, and the hybrid 

representation is impermissible. So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can we go back to 

just --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The State -- the State 

has no responsibility even though it made this 

appointment? So you agree there's no difference, 

whether it was paid counsel, somebody that the -- that 

the defendant picked to represent him, and someone that 

he just had to take because it's what the State gave him? 

MR. MAKAR: Exactly. And -- and that's the 

way the Court's decision in Coleman has allocated the

burdens and the risks. I mean, what the Court said was 

okay, if it's a direct appeal where the State is charged 

with that responsibility, that's one thing; but when 

it's postconviction, it's shifted. The whole paradigm 

and whole structure is flipped the other way, and you, 

the Petitioner, bear the burden, and not the State. 

This is important under AEDPA, because AEDPA --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Under -- on direct appeal, 

if counsel conducted himself this way, the State 

would -- he’d have to get relief because the State 

would have the burden, but not -- not on collateral? 

Is that what you're saying? 

MR. MAKAR: Sure. On direct appeal, if the 

lawyer is deemed to be ineffective, then that would be a 

constitutional error, and that would be subject to some 

sort of relief, but it flips in the postconviction 

stage, as this Court has held in Coleman. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I'm 

concerned about some of the situations Justice Breyer 

mentions, you know, if there is an earthquake, a plane 

crash, but the law seems to be focusing on other things 

when it's talking about extraordinary circumstances. 

Like here, we’re talking about how diligent he was in 

pursuing his lawyer. There seems to be a disconnect 

there.

I don't know why -- I mean, assuming we’re 

going to have, for argument, equitable tolling, what 

should we be looking at? The unusual nature of the 

situation that comes up, or whether you've got a pesky 

client? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, I think two responses 

there: Obviously, we believe that attorney incompetence 

or so forth cannot be a basis for equitable tolling. 

These other situations about natural disasters and 

hypotheticals where some, you know, very unusual, bizarre 

situation comes in that’s external to the 

attorney-client relationship, perhaps those -- those 

could be considered. 

But we believe that the Congress, through its 

purpose in enacting this statute of limitations, a 

complex one that has exceptions, that -- that is 

designed to alleviate the burdens and delays -- its intent 

was not to allow equitable tolling, because we --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it 

legislated against the background of cases like Irwin 

that stated the general proposition is, unless Congress 

says otherwise, there is equitable tolling. 

MR. MAKAR: But that can be rebutted. That 

can be rebutted, and we believe has been rebutted by the 

record here, which shows that these are precisely the

kind of delays that Congress intended to avoid by having 

a strict 1-year statute of limitations, that there's 

burdens put on -- not just the States but the courts --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- what I worry about 

is that you’re confusing the -- or perceive --

confusing the fact that lawyer negligence may not be the 

type of situation that Congress was looking at. With 

the hypotheticals that Justice Breyer listed, which are 

a different kind of situation, and you are trying to 

pigeonhole both and say Congress didn't intend for both 

to be covered. And yet you suggested a little later 

that they may have intended what Justice Breyer was 

thinking about. I -- I don't see anything in the 

structure of the statute that would preclude what 

Justice Breyer listed. 

MR. MAKAR: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what can we read to 

suggest that -- forget about the lawyer malfeasance; 

let's talk just about equitable tolling 

MR. MAKAR: Sure. Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- in its traditional 

sense. Most of the cases in equitable tolling, by the way, 

have to do with court errors. 

MR. MAKAR: Sure. What we’re suggesting is 

that under the structure of the Brockamp decision, what

the Court looked at there to determine when there is no 

equitable tolling intended by Congress, that here 

likewise there is no equitable tolling, and as the Court 

held in Brockamp, the fact that there may be unfairness 

in individual cases was the price Congress was willing 

to pay, the tradeoff it was willing to allow, to have a 

habeas system that was functioning. 

Now, assuming that position is rejected by 

the Court or the Court assumes equitable tolling, the 

next question is what should be allowed. And we believe 

it has to be exceptionally narrow. And certainly in 

this case -- and this case is all about attorney 

negligence or attorney gross negligence -- those --

those sort of circumstances are not enough. And --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why could you not say 

here -- I mean, the key sentence, I take it, is the 

Eleventh Circuit and it says: “No allegation of lawyer 

negligence or failure to meet the standard of care” --

none -- without “proof, bad faith, dishonesty, mental 

impairment” on the part of the lawyer, could ever 

qualify. 

Now, that's -- so we just say, no, no, that 

isn't so. Sometimes it could, when combined with other 

circumstances. And then go back and let them -- I don't 

know what this particular individual Petitioner's prior

conduct has been. I understand the problems that you 

have. But do you -- I guess you’re going to say no to 

this, but -- but it's a little hard to see why you couldn't 

have a narrow standard but just not rule out the 

possibility that under certain circumstances, just 

negligence or even less -- maybe the lawyer wasn't even 

at fault; maybe he got kidnapped. You know, I mean, there 

are odd things that happen in life. And just say go look for 

this; see if it's truly extraordinary, if it's fair, if 

he was diligent. What about that? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, we agree with the Eleventh 

Circuit standard to the extent it says, you know, that this 

sort of attorney negligence, gross negligence, incompetence, 

is not enough. Where we differ from the Eleventh Circuit 

is we're concerned, based upon our pragmatic day-in, 

day-out handling of these cases, that when you say 

dishonesty, well -- or a conflict -- that those concepts 

can be conflated into things that they are not, 

particularly when these communications between lawyer 

and client are outside the State's view. We are not 

privy to what goes on between lawyer and client. The 

lawyer says, I will do this, says it verbally or maybe 

even in writing. We don't know about that. We're not 

privy to all that. 

And it creates this potential, when we allow

the standard, as the Eleventh Circuit held -- we allow the 

standard to gravitate away from its core purpose and 

allows it to be used to sort of game the system in a way 

to gain an advantage. That's why we are concerned about 

any degree of attorney misconduct or behavior because it 

could easily --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any idea, 

before the Eleventh Circuit announced its standard, how 

many habeas petitions were tolled by district courts in 

that -- in your -- in Florida, on the basis of equitable 

tolling, that -- that they permitted petitions to go 

forward after the statute of limitations? 

MR. MAKAR: Unfortunately, I'm not aware of 

any data on that. There are not that many. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So would there be -- I 

mean, what I'm actually worried about is not a lawyer 

being kidnapped. I'm actually worried what can 

happen in a person’s life. He gets deathly ill. His wife 

gets sick. Something happens to the children. Some very 

unusual thing comes along at the last minute, and all the 

plans go awry. And to have a little bit of flexibility 

in this statute to take care of those very unusual human 

circumstances seems a reasonable reading of it. But you 

say it's not because --

Congress intended not to have equitable tolling, and 

then to the extent it did, it could have drafted 

something along the lines of what's in 2263, which is 

the next chapter -- it’s the companion chapter that says 

instead of having 365 days with no equitable tolling, 

you can have 180 days and 30 days for good cause if 

there's a deadline missed --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're not -- you're 

not worried about Justice Breyer's case of the really 

extraordinary circumstance where everybody would say, 

well, that's -- you know, we understand. You’re 

worried that if you create an exception, that all sorts 

of other stuff will come in. And so why isn't the answer 

to that concern that you’ve got an unusual case here 

where you do have the client saying, do this, do this, 

do this, and the lawyer doesn't? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, under these facts --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's very hard to 

argue against -- against equity, against equitable 

tolling. But at the same time, I think you do need a 

constraining principle that it doesn't do away with the 

statute of limitations. So why isn't what we have here 

good enough?

standard?

that you have got a client who is constantly telling the

judgment. And, you know, it's not just your run-of-the-mill 

case where the lawyer happens to miss a deadline. 

MR. MAKAR: Well, that goes to the issue 

that -- of not -- of diligence, of course, which is not 

the issue we’re looking at. We’re looking at the 

extraordinary circumstances, not the diligence. 

Extraordinary circumstance has to be something that --

attributable to the lawyer or something along those lines. 

We're not -- we'll concede diligence for the 

moment and say here it's what the lawyer did, as 

Lawrence held. He missed the deadline. In fact, 

this case -- you know, Lawrence, obviously -- it was 364 

days before they even filed the State postconviction motion, 

and the lawyer in that case wasn't appointed for 300 days, 

and the State postconvictions process was sort of in 

disarray. And all those things that the Court in 

Lawrence said are not supportable for equitable tolling 

apply equally here. 

The only difference in this case is this 

allegation about the -- the lawyer didn't communicate 

with his client. Well, if that becomes the governing rule, 

all is lost, because attorney communication with client

is perhaps even more amorphous a concept. It could be 

based on verbal representations and so forth. So we are 

very concerned that it not slip into that sphere where 

it can be easily manipulated for the advantage of 

getting some sort of delay. 

And as I say, the analysis here of 

purpose of AEDPA, structure of AEDPA, and the 

burdens -- as I say, the burdens are important to the 

State and to the court system. I was looking at that 

recent study, the 2007 study, that seemed to suggest 

that AEDPA is -- basically, when these cases are being 

filed in Federal district court, it has taken a year and 

a half to 2, 3 years for them to be resolved, and in 

this case keep in mind it took 18 months in the district 

court, 18 months in the Eleventh Circuit, and then 

further. 

But that’s allowing the invocation of this 

doctrine, not just in this case. We’re worried about the 

noncapital context as well, that that will somehow put 

an end to the importance of what Congress enacted. 

There is a pre-AEDPA mentality out there, 

I'm afraid. And it's natural. It's understandable. 

We're all human. There’s a pre-AEDPA mentality that 

there must be a remedy. There must be some equity done. 

And I think that sort of undergirds why perhaps most of

the circuits have either assumed -- I think 11 have 

either assumed or adopted some sort of equitable 

tolling. 

I think they are waiting for this Court, 

which has left the question open to provide guidance on 

that issue, and we suggest that either there be no 

equitable tolling or that, if there is to be equitable 

tolling, on the circumstances of this case it has to be 

extreme attorney misconduct or incompetence, and that 

just simply is not established on this record. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- why isn't it 

extreme attorney incompetence to miss a deadline? I 

mean, you either miss it or you don't. It's not going 

to get -- why doesn't that qualify as extreme attorney 

misconduct? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, I guess the short answer, 

of course, is the courts have said no, that's not 

enough, we need something that’s truly extreme, 

something far from just missing a deadline. We probably 

all know lawyers who have missed deadlines. We all know 

lawyers who haven't communicated with their clients. 

Those things are ordinary, run-of-the-mill, happen-every-day 

sort of events. It has to be something beyond that. 

It has to be something that is truly extreme for 

the exception to kick in.

to not file something on time? I mean, oh gosh, that 

strikes us all as just -- that’s --

we think about a situation, and -- and --

has to be criminal behavior? 

MR. MAKAR: It has to be something beyond 

just attorney incompetence. What the -- that's a 

concept that we can get our arms around, and we 

certainly get into this line-drawing of, well, is a 

failure to communicate three or four times enough? Or a 

failure to have a letter go to the client in response to 

his request -- is that enough?

question? It doesn't go to the merits, but I'm really 

curious. The lawyers selected for postconviction work, 

which I understand now are compensated by the State, are 

they selected from the same panels as the lawyers that 

represent defendants generally and who are appointed by 

the State in criminal matters? 

MR. MAKAR: Well, there’s a collateral counsel 

registry list. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Is it --

MR. MAKAR: There’s actually what they call 

CCRC. There's actually State lawyers around the State who 

provide this, and then there’s a registry list as well. 

And they have to meet certain standards. Chapter 27 of 

our Florida Statutes set out the standards that these 

counsel have to meet. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the collateral counsel 

registry is a different group of lawyers than are 

generally appointed in criminal cases? 

MR. MAKAR: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I see. 

MR. MAKAR: Well, Your Honors, if there’s 

no further questions, we ask that the court affirm the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TODD G. SCHER 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. SCHER: I just have a couple of brief 

points. First, to clarify, the Respondent argued that 

Mr. Holland never asked to proceed pro se in the State 

court, and that’s just incorrect, and it's flatly 

contradicted by their brief on page 43, where they 

write: "Holland moved to replace Collins with another 

attorney (whom Holland presumably thought would raise 

any issues Holland desired) or to proceed pro se if 

substitute counsel could not be appointed." 

And I think, again, going back to one of 

the things that Justice Breyer was discussing with 

Respondent's counsel, was I think that that -- the 

problem with the Eleventh Circuit's analysis is this 

categorical exclusion. Equitable tolling and 

extraordinary circumstances have to be considered as 

a -- consider all the circumstances, and so to 

categorically exclude this one particular area, 

we submit, is what the problem is here. 

And we also do have, contrary to what

the Respondent contended --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you would say --

it is -- you could categorically excuse ordinary 

negligence as opposed to gross negligence? 

MR. SCHER: That's where courts, including 

this Court, have drawn the line. That seems to be the 

floor, but, you know, obviously, when you get into the 

particular circumstances of a case, that's where a 

categorical rule excluding a particular type of area 

beyond just garden-variety neglect -- really, that's 

the problem here, is that was antithetical to the 

notion of equity. 

And I just wanted to point out briefly that 

this record does avail itself of numerous instances where 

Mr. Holland had alleged that the attorney lied to him. JA 

-- in the Joint Appendix on 170, Mr. Holland writes that 

Mr. Collins lied to him. On the Joint Appendix on 194, 

that Mr. Collins deceived him and misled him --

going to be --

Federal habeas rights. Those --

JUSTICE ALITO: Doesn't that go without 

saying, that every attorney -- and every attorney presumably 

undertakes not to miss the statute of limitations? Is 

there a difference between the attorney who simply says 

nothing and the attorney who says, yes, I'm not going to 

miss the statute of limitations? 

MR. SCHER: I think it makes it more --

JUSTICE ALITO: That’s a lie? 

MR. SCHER: I think it makes it makes 

it more extraordinary. And what makes that situation 

even yet more extraordinary is where the client has 

tried to rid himself of this lawyer on a number of 

occasions or to go pro se, precisely because he has been 

experiencing these -- these -- lack of trust and other 

problems in terms of these deceptions from his lawyer, 

so he was really hamstrung by the time that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I’m worried --

MR. SCHER: -- it was too late. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I’m worried about 

the open-ended nature of what you’re asking for, how --

how would you state the test you would like in the most 

restrictive terms?

incorrect in excluding this particular type of attorney 

misconduct and negligence because that’s antithetical 

to equity, and so I think --

problem comes up when you say “this type of attorney 

negligence.” 

What is your test? What type of --

unique facts here, we have, again, the confluence of 

circumstances. We have the --

you start saying, well, you can forgive an inequitable case, 

every time a case comes up, you’re going to -- there’s 

going to be sympathy for the client. The lawyer goofed. 

Of course, you don't want to penalize the 

client, but Congress obviously had something more in 

mind. 

MR. SCHER: Well, but certainly -- but the other 

part of the test for equitable tolling is diligence, and 

I think, when -- when one looks at the -- at the body of 

case law that has developed since 1997 on the issue of 

equitable tolling and AEDPA, the vast majority of these 

cases are disposed on the fact that the Petitioner is 

indiligent. 

Here, of course, the Respondent, if I heard 

correctly, is now conceding that the Petitioner was 

diligent. And so there are certainly other ways to avoid 

even having to get to the question of exceptional 

circumstances; for example, just looking to the 

diligence prong. 

But here, where you have a failure to 

notify, you have the failure to heed the instructions from 

a client, you have the client saying you’ve lied to 

me, the client telling the State and the Federal courts 

this lawyer is not my agent anymore, I don't want him, I 

don't trust him, he has misled me, he has deceived me --
