 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument this afternoon in Case 08-992, 

Beard v. Kindler.

 Mr. Eisenberg.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD EISENBERG

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. EISENBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 Joseph Kindler, after attacking the judicial 

process by murdering a witness against him, again 

repudiated that process by breaking out of prison twice 

and fleeing the country.

 The court of appeals refused to honor the 

resulting procedural default on the ground that it was 

inadequate because discretionary. This Court should 

clarify that the purpose of the adequate State grounds 

doctrine isn't to strip State courts of their equitable 

power to excuse procedural defaults, but simply to 

ensure that they don't discriminate against Federal 

claims under the guise of procedural ruling.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I didn't understand the 

Third Circuit rule to equate discretion with inadequacy. 

I thought their position was -- the assertion was that

the rule was mandatory; that is, if you are fugitives, 

you are out forever.

 But in fact, at the time that Kindler fled, 

the rule was discretionary, so the mandatory rule hadn't 

been firmly established. That's what I thought the 

Third Circuit held. It did not equate discretion with 

inadequacy.

 MR. EISENBERG: That was the -- the argument 

presented, but I think what the Third Circuit held was 

simply to equate discretion with inadequacy. But in any 

case, Justice Ginsburg --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that? I mean, why 

do we have to guess about it? Where -- where do you 

find that in its opinion? Because I have -- I have the 

same -- the same problem.

 MR. EISENBERG: I don't think we really have 

to guess, Your Honor. I think, looking, for example, in 

the third appendix at the top of page 22, where the 

Third Circuit is characterizing its prior law in this 

question:

 "After surveying decisions of the 

Pennsylvania courts, we concluded that the Pennsylvania 

courts had discretion to hear an appeal filed by a 

fugitive who had been returned to custody before an 

appeal was initiated and dismissed. Accordingly, the

fugitive-forfeiture rule was not firmly established and, 

therefore, is not an independent and adequate procedural 

rule."

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the fugitive-

forfeiture rule that they were talking about was the --

the mandatory rule wasn't firmly established.

 MR. EISENBERG: Well, I don't think that's a 

fair reading of this language, in and of itself, Your 

Honor. But it really doesn't matter for our position, 

and that's because the rule that was applied to this 

defendant was a discretionary rule.

 The Pennsylvania -- the trial court in this 

case exercised his discretion not to reinstate 

post-verdict motions. The opinion that was written by 

the trial court and is in the joint appendix at page --

I believe it's 69, Your Honor -- states that the 

question was whether the trial judge abused his 

discretion in declining to reinstate post-trial motions.

 When the case that Your Honor's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I have a number of 

problems with the Third Circuit's opinion, but the 

question presented, it seems to me, is not really the 

dispositive point of the opinion. I don't think the 

question you presented is really that squarely before 

us.

MR. EISENBERG: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I don't see a split, 

either. I mean, of course, there is going to be some 

discretion. The question is -- the Third Circuit, as I 

read the opinion, was concerned that it wasn't firmly 

established at the time of the waiver.

 I have real problems with whether the waiver 

should even be -- whether the time of the waiver is 

controlling, but that is not the question you asked us 

to resolve.

 MR. EISENBERG: Your Honor, I think the 

problem here and the reason that we are at this point is 

that, whether the test is stated directly as being a per 

se ban on discretion or whether simply the standard is 

so high under an interpretation of "firmly established" 

that allows for virtually no deviation in results by the 

State courts, the effect is the same. It's to drive out 

the exercise of discretion by the State courts.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this wasn't the 

ruling by the court in analyzing your cases and 

saying -- you know, in six out of the cases -- six out 

of the ten cases, discretion was exercised, in four it 

wasn't, and so it's not firmly established because the 

numbers are skewed.

 Justice Ginsburg -- you pointed Justice

Ginsburg to page 23, and the Court very directly there 

says, look, we are rejecting the State's argument that 

the waiver rule was mandatory.

 MR. EISENBERG: Justice Sotomayor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so it characterized 

your argument that way, that you were saying the 

district court had no discretion.

 MR. EISENBERG: Justice Sotomayor, the State 

didn't argue in Federal court that the State rule was 

mandatory. We were very explicit.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, whether you think 

you did or didn't, that's how the court described it, so 

it understood you to be taking a different position.

 Are we going to correct it because it 

misunderstood you? Or --

MR. EISENBERG: The problem is that the 

Third Circuit did not engage in any inquiry about the 

nature of the rule that was applied to this defendant, 

so it was not in any position to say that a different 

rule was applied to this defendant than the rule that 

should have been applied.

 That's the problem with the argument that a 

new rule was sprung on this defendant. The rule that 

was applied to this defendant was discretion, and the 

Third Circuit never discusses anything other than that.

They reject our argument that the underlying 

rule was mandatory in that language, but they never 

discuss what rule was actually applied to this 

defendant. We think it was clearly a discretionary 

rule.

 But the -- the real question is whether, at 

the time of the default, the default that occurred by 

the extraordinary act of escaping, the defendant was not 

fairly apprised of the consequences of his action.

 And, really, whether or not the rule --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You mean that the 

defendant might not have escaped if he knew that the 

rule wasn't --

MR. EISENBERG: Well, I think that's the 

irony of applying this sort of adequacy analysis to this 

kind of default, but that, I think, is more of a problem 

for Kindler than for the Commonwealth.

 This Court has consistently held in its 

adequacy cases that the litigant must have ample 

opportunity to comply with the State's procedure.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I don't know why you 

submit -- why you seem to concede that that applies 

here. I can understand why we want to look at the time 

of the waiver if it's an attorney arguing about jury 

instructions and so forth, but the man escapes when the

door is open or when the window is open, and he doesn't 

give consideration to these things; and if he does, I 

think that's quite irrelevant.

 It seems to me that the waiver point is --

is something that shouldn't be conceded. I think that 

if ten years elapse between the time of the escape and 

the time the State formulates its rules, that he is 

bound by those rules when he gets there. But you don't 

argue that. That's not what you presented to us.

 MR. EISENBERG: Well, I think, Your Honor, 

what we are presenting is that the nature of the State 

rule here was -- was such that the defendant had 

reasonable notice of what he was facing by escaping, 

whether or not it would have affected his subjective 

decision to escape, and therefore that the State ground 

can't be thrown out in Federal court on the ground of 

adequacy. And really, whether the rule was strictly 

mandatory in 1984 or discretionary doesn't much matter 

for purposes of putting the defendant on notice that if 

he escaped, he was going to run into serious trouble 

trying to appeal at the same time that he was trying to 

stay in Canada for the rest of his life.

 That's what this case is really all about. 

And yet, the lower courts I think have so misconstrued 

this Court's adequacy doctrine that they have come to

the point of saying that even in that situation, the 

rule is inadequate and can be ignored in Federal court.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What court has said? As 

I read the Third Circuit, it says:  A procedural rule 

that is consistently applied in the vast majority of 

cases; even if State courts are willing to occasionally 

overlook it and review the merits of a claim, that 

that's okay.

 MR. EISENBERG: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what other circuit 

has said that any measure of discretion or even a lot of 

use of discretion bars deference to the State rule?

 MR. EISENBERG: Justice Sotomayor, I think 

if you look at the amicus brief filed on behalf of 25 

States, you will see that that there are a great many 

cases where that's exactly the analysis that the courts 

have applied, and in many of those cases they have 

required the parties to place before them dozens and 

sometimes hundreds of other examples of the operation of 

a State procedural rule so that the lower Federal court 

can decide whether that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How many of those cases 

resulted in the overturning or the grant of habeas --

MR. EISENBERG: I think in California, for 

example, it's been quite common. The State's rule for

timeliness of post-conviction communications is seldom 

enforced in Federal court, as we learned from the amicus 

brief. In fact, it virtually doesn't exist. And even 

in those cases where the courts --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But do we -- what --

what does that tell us about us establishing the rule 

that you propose?

 MR. EISENBERG: I think what it tells us is 

that the lower courts are applying a very different 

adequacy rule than this Court has been applying. We are 

not really asking for some kind of new rule from this 

Court as compared to your prior line of cases on 

adequacy.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But you are asking us to 

take away a part of the inquiry.

 MR. EISENBERG: Not at all, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Your notice -- your 

notice and an opportunity to comply doesn't address a 

repeated statement by us, which is that whatever test is 

applied has to get to whether the State court is 

attempting to evade Federal review of constitutional 

questions.

 MR. EISENBERG: Yes, it does, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And so your 

test does nothing to inform that question, for example,

the Flowers situation. There was a clear rule, there 

was more than an adequate opportunity to comply, and yet 

we said it didn't qualify for deference because it was 

clearly, given the circumstances of the State 

application of the rule at issue, an attempt to evade a 

constitutional right.

 MR. EISENBERG: The question is what those 

circumstances are, Your Honor. And in virtually case 

after case, the circumstances that have been identified 

by this Court for actually finding a rule inadequate are 

that the State rule was some kind of bait and switch, 

that it was a -- to use Justice Holmes' classic 

formulation, that it was a spring -- a trap that was 

sprung on the defendant. One rule existed at the time 

that the litigant was proceeding, another rule was 

applied when the case reached appeal. And that is 

characteristically what has made this Court, not the 

lower Federal courts, but this Court, hold that rules 

were actually inadequate.

 So in Ford v. Georgia, for example, where 

the defendant raised a Batson claim after the jury was 

sworn, because that's what the law was at the time of 

his trial, when the case reached appeal the appellate --

the State appellate court said: No, no; we have a new 

rule now; you have to do it before the jury is sworn.

And they found his claim waived. That rule was 

inadequate.

 In James v. Kentucky, where the defendant 

asked for an adverse inference charge and he asked for 

an admonition rather than an instruction, and the State 

court said, no, no, it was supposed to be an instruction 

rather than an admonition, that was a reversal of prior 

State law.

 There are many cases very much like that 

where there is a spring set by the State in the sense 

that a different rule is applied on appeal than was 

before the litigant at the time that he was trying to 

comply with the rule.

 Now, this case obviously is quite far from 

that, and that's exactly why this case should have been 

the last sort of case where a rule was found inadequate. 

The higher the standard that the lower courts apply, the 

stricter the standard that the lower Federal courts 

apply to analyze the adequacy of State rules, the less 

opportunity there will be for discretion on the part of 

the States. And the loser in that equation, while it 

might not be this defendant, will be the vast majority 

of defendants who would have been more entitled, more 

deserving of discretion, of leniency from the State 

courts.

The State courts need to be allowed to apply 

the kind of discretion in their procedural rulings that 

this Court applies, that the Federal courts are allowed 

in -- in Federal procedural rulings -- for example, 

under the plain error rule, even under the Federal 

fugitive-forfeiture rule.

 In 1876 this Court said that it's within our 

discretion to dismiss a case where the defendant is a 

fugitive, and since then, while there have been a number 

of decisions from this Court concerning fugitive 

defendants, none of them have laid out the sort of menu, 

the sort of standards and substandards and subrules that 

the defendant is now arguing have to be present in a 

rule for it to be adequate.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question that you 

present -- I mean, you state it forthrightly in your 

brief, and I'm reading from page 7, you say: "The court 

of appeals interpreted this Court's precedent to compel 

a finding of inadequacy for any State procedural rule 

that permits the State courts to exercise a degree of 

discretion. Any discretion is inadequate." That's what 

you say the court of appeals interpreted this Court's 

precedent to say: Discretion, inadequate.

 Well, I'm looking first at the petition 

appendix page 62, which describes the district court's

understanding, which the Third Circuit affirmed. It 

says: "An occasional act of grace by a State court in 

excusing or disregarding a State procedural rule does 

not render the rule inadequate to procedurally bar 

advancing a habeas claim in district court."

 Well, that's saying, yes, you can have a 

rule with discretion, not to follow the rule woodenly, 

and that doesn't make it inadequate.

 MR. EISENBERG: Justice Ginsburg, an 

occasional act of grace, that level of -- of leniency or 

flexibility that would be allowed by the district 

court's view of the law, or the Third Circuit's, is 

simply not appropriate in judging the adequacy of State 

grounds.

 It's certainly not the kind of miserly, 

crabbed review of the exercise of discretion that occurs 

in Federal procedural rulings like the plain error rule.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, do you want to 

modify then what you said? You said that the court of 

appeals said that any -- any degree of discretion means 

that the rule is inadequate.

 MR. EISENBERG: Justice Ginsburg, we say 

that because there was no analysis here of what degree 

of discretion or whether discretion was actually applied 

by the State court in this case. That's why, in effect,

we say that the Third Circuit's ruling was about the per 

se exercise of discretion.

 But even if it wasn't automatically about 

the exercise of discretion, even if it was merely 

applying a rule which is so narrow and strict that in 

practical effect the State courts have little actual 

discretion to exercise, that's still a problem and it's 

still inconsistent with the purpose of the adequate 

State grounds doctrine, which was never intended to 

allow Federal courts or to require lower Federal courts 

to engage in the kind of analysis that many of the lower 

Federal courts are now undertaking.

 Basically, they -- they are taking out their 

magnifying glasses and starting to split hairs by 

looking at every single case, by looking at how those 

cases compare to each other, by deciding whether there's 

enough of a standard, is there enough of a precedent, 

did you tell this little particular little fact to the 

defendant before. That sort of analysis is not part of 

this Court's adequacy doctrine.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what makes -- makes 

this particularly puzzling is you are attributing a rule 

to the Third Circuit that that very circuit in Campbell 

v. Burris said was not a tool. In the -- in Campbell v. 

Burris, the Third Circuit said a State procedural rule

can't be, cannot be rendered per se inadequate merely 

because it allows for some exercise of discretion.

 MR. EISENBERG: And I think if the Third 

Circuit had applied that statement in this case, there 

might have been a different result and at the very least 

there would have been additional analysis, because that 

calls for additional analysis beyond the absolute lack 

of analysis in this opinion about the nature of the rule 

that was actually applied to this defendant.

 Without that sort of analysis, you can't say 

that the Court is looking at whether this -- this 

particular exercise of discretion came within the small 

window that that court would allow to the States. That 

-- that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it would be really 

odd, considering that one member of the panel was on 

both cases, Stapleton, and these cases are in the same 

year, for at least that judge not to think that what he 

said in the one case was in no conflict with what he 

said in the other.

 MR. EISENBERG: And yet we have a result, 

Your Honor, which is explainable only on the ground that 

the State court rule maintains some power of discretion 

by the State courts. There is nothing else in the 

opinion that explains the result in this case.

But I emphasize again that, even if the 

court had applied a different rule, the rule that it 

said it was applying in some of the Third Circuit's 

other panel opinions, we would still be left with a 

standard which is far narrower than anything that this 

Court has actually applied in its own decisions.

 There have been a variety of phrases in the 

Court's decisions, things like "firmly established," 

"strictly followed," "regularly applied."

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it seems to me that 

that's not what the Third -- Third Circuit was saying. 

It was saying that adequacy of the rule is determined by 

the law in effect at the time of the waiver, and it 

wasn't well-established.

 Now, I have real problems with that as an 

opening premise, but that's not what you asked us to 

resolve in your petition.

 MR. EISENBERG: Well, I don't think that 

there is an analysis of whether the law was -- was 

established at the time of the waiver, Your Honor, 

because what the court says, or at least what the 

precedents it rely on say, is that at the time of the 

waiver here, assuming for the moment that that's the 

relevant inquiry, the rule was discretionary.

 The question then has to be, was that rule

applied to the defendant? If a different rule is 

applied to the defendant, if the difference --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I don't know 

how you say that. Yes, it was clearly established that 

the district court had discretion -- none of the 

justices below disagreed with this -- to dismiss 

post-verdict motions on the basis of flight. The courts 

below themselves said: What we don't have a rule about 

is what we do with respect to a post-judgment motion to 

reinstate or how we the appellate court will treat that 

waiver once it comes before us. Will we apply it to the 

appellate process as well?

 I understood the Third Circuit to be saying 

that it was those two latter components, which the 

courts below themselves identified as new questions, 

that it was resolving, that involve new rules.

 MR. EISENBERG: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's as simply as I 

thought the issue was. Maybe your adversary will 

dissuade me and concede your point that what the court 

was saying, the discretionary application, is what was 

at issue, but if as I've described things is correct, 

how does your position continue to be sustained?

 MR. EISENBERG: That wasn't State law in 

fact, Your Honor. The State courts didn't make the kind

of decision that the Federal court, not actually in this 

case, but in the case that it cited, Doctor, tried to 

make. That is a distinction that Doctor invented from 

State law. It is not a distinction that the State cases 

announced themselves.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you are 

disagreeing with is the Third Circuit's conclusion of 

what the status of Pennsylvania law was?

 MR. EISENBERG: Well, that would have been 

clearer, I think, if we were appealing from the Doctor 

decision here now rather than from this decision, but I 

think that there is at the very least a great degree of 

unclarity in exactly what the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, Doctor dealt with 

what will the court do with respect to, not post-verdict 

motions, but with respect to appeals that are raised 

before or after flight.

 MR. EISENBERG: That is what Doctor said was 

a distinction in State law.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And that's what Doctor 

said?

 MR. EISENBERG: Doctor said that. Only that 

Federal court said that.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So now the only other --

do -- according to the courts below, what are we going 

to do with post-verdict motions to reinstate and to 

appeals that result after flight and after waiver; 

correct?

 MR. EISENBERG: In fact, not a new question 

at all under State law, Your Honor. And we have cited 

several State court opinions --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's where the 

disagreement lies: Did the Third Circuit get 

Pennsylvania law wrong on this issue.

 MR. EISENBERG: I think that's at least 

where the disagreement lie -- lay between the 

Commonwealth and Kindler below. As I say, I think 

there's a great --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. Let's assume 

the Third Circuit, that we take the hypothetical that 

they were right. How do you still win?

 MR. EISENBERG: Then the question becomes, 

Your Honor, whether the alleged discrepancy, difference 

in the State law or -- or degree of unclarity is 

sufficient to meet this Court's adequacy test.

 And that's where I think we get back to 

Federal analogies like the Federal fugitive flight rule. 

And I'd like to address that -- that question, and then 

reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

Under the Federal fugitive flight rule, many 

of these kinds of distinctions have never been spelled 

out. The courts simply laid out a general rule starting 

in the late 1800s that it was within our discretion to 

dismiss.

 But despite the fact that the Court hasn't 

basically subdivided the rule with the nit-picking 

analysis that the Doctor court tried to impose on the 

Pennsylvania cases, that doesn't make the fugitive-

forfeiture rule inadequate and therefore inapplicable to 

defendants. In fact, even after this Court's decision 

in Ortega-Rodriguez, which overturned an automatic 

forfeiture rule on -- applied by the Federal Court of 

Appeals, the Court allowed the district court's 

discretion to carry out the fugitive-forfeiture rule as 

they saw fit under the circumstances. And the day after 

Ortega-Rodriguez, despite the fact that no substandards 

had yet been developed, there was still a Federal 

fugitive-forfeiture rule --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask one question 

before your time is gone? Has there ever been a 

precedent in Pennsylvania where they have applied the 

procedural default rule against a capital defendant who 

-- who was guilty of flight?

 MR. EISENBERG: No, Your Honor, and I think

that that's an excellent example of what I was just 

saying. The fact that the general rule of fugitive-

forfeiture hadn't yet addressed the subquestion of 

whether there should be an exception for capital 

defendants did not render the State rule inadequate.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But wasn't there -- wasn't 

there a general rule that capital defendants always get 

one shot at their constitutional issues?

 MR. EISENBERG: No, Your Honor. At this 

time, there was simply a rule that said that in capital 

cases we will apply a limited form of relaxation of 

our -- of our rules to address significant questions. 

When you look at that language, it's almost exactly the 

same as the Federal plain error rule.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But were there 

Pennsylvania cases in which they had prevented a capital 

defendant from raising a Federal constitutional issue 

for the first time?

 MR. EISENBERG: No, Your Honor. There had 

only been a few capital cases even decided at the time 

of the flight here.

 The point is that the way that the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: How about other rules? In 

capital cases, had they applied other procedural default 

rules at -- for the first time a capital defendant

 MR. EISENBERG: At that time, I think they

JUSTICE STEVENS: So then how can you have a 

firmly established rule?

 MR. EISENBERG: I don't think you have a 

firmly established rule, Your Honor, because you have --

the firmly established rule was the preexisting rule 

requiring preservation of error claims, in the same way 

that under the Federal plain error rule the rule is you 

have to preserve your claims.

 A defendant cannot come along and say: Hey, 

in Rule 52(b) it says that if my claim is plain and 

significant it's not waived, and therefore I have no 

obligation to ever preserve my claims. The Federal 

plain error rule is an exception that might apply to 

you, but it doesn't do away with the underlying rule of 

issue preservation.

 Thank you.

I first want to address what is really at 

stake here. The Commonwealth wants this Court to change 

the adequate State ground doctrine so that Mr. Kindler 

may be executed with no review by any court of his 

meritorious claims that his death sentence was 

unconstitutional.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that's 

because he escaped. He avoided judicial process, and 

you would have him be in the same position once he's 

captured and returned and captured and returned as he 

was before he escaped at all, right?

 MR. LAWRY: Well, the question is, was there 

a firmly established and consistently applied State rule 

that would result in all of his claims being taken away.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you think 

that -- and you don't think -- you think you can argue 

that a State rule saying, look, if you escape and flee 

the jurisdiction, you bar -- your claims cannot be 

adequate and independent?

 MR. LAWRY: No, I don't think that, Your 

Honor. What -- what -- what this Court has always 

required and what we are arguing, this Court has always 

required that a State procedural rule be firmly 

established and consistently applied in order to take 

away a litigant's claims.

And our position and what the Third Circuit 

below held was that in numerous respects, the -- the 

rules that the State court applied here were not firmly 

established or consistently applied.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What rules -- I'm --

MR. LAWRY: Well, it's really --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What is -- what is your 

position as to what the Third Circuit was saying or 

holding? Are you saying, like your adversary, that they 

were saying because it was discretionary and there were 

a lot of exceptions to it, it wasn't firmly established? 

Or were you -- or do you read it as saying, now that you 

have made it mandatory, that's a new rule -- the waiver 

mandatory, that's a new rule?

 MR. LAWRY: Well -- well, to begin with, 

what we're saying is that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's not what you are 

saying. What do you think the Third Circuit said?

 MR. LAWRY: What -- what I would suggest the 

Third Circuit said is that this case is very like 

Doctor. It said Doctor was controlling precedent, and 

Doctor involved a defendant who fled pretrial or in the 

middle of trial, and at that time there was a sort of 

two-part rule in Pennsylvania for dealing with fugitive-

forfeiture.

One part was -- and this is in noncapital 

cases. One part was if the defendant flees during the 

appellate process, then the appeal could be dismissed. 

The other part was if it's any time before that, there 

is discretion.

 And -- and so, when Doctor appealed, by the 

time his appeal was heard, Pennsylvania had changed its 

rule completely to one in which a flight at any time, at 

any time at all, was considered a complete forfeiture. 

And that was -- it was that change from a discretionary 

rule to a forfeiture rule that the Third Circuit said in 

Doctor was inadequate. And it said again in Kindler 

that the same kind of change was inadequate.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What was the change --

MR. LAWRY: The change --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that you think the 

Third Circuit was identifying?

 MR. LAWRY: The change that the Third 

Circuit identified was from a -- a situation where there 

was complete discretion -- and really more often than 

not, even in noncapital cases, the discretion was 

exercised to hear the issues. It changed from that to 

one where there is essentially a -- a presumption of --

of waiver or forfeiture and some potential way to --

lower court in this case had said: You know, we have 

discretion, but we're not going to exercise it because 

you escaped twice and were away much longer than most 

fugitives. There is a presumption that witnesses' 

memories fade, that it's harder for trials that are so 

distant from the event, that distant from an event. We 

are not going to exercise our discretion.

 Is it your view -- because that's the 

undertone I'm hearing -- that under firmly established 

ground that the court would have still ruled that that 

exercise of discretion was not adequate under --

MR. LAWRY: That the Third Circuit would 

have said that?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yeah.

 MR. LAWRY: It's a very -- it's a very 

different case. I think if --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Sure, it is. But what 

you -- there is a tone to the way you presented this 

case that says because they chose often to exercise 

discretion in the past, if they choose not to in any 

case, it's no longer an independent State ground. 

That's what -- is that the point you are arguing?

 MR. LAWRY: No.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because that's the 

question presented.

MR. LAWRY: That's not the point that we are 

arguing. What we are arguing is that there needs to be 

consistent application of the rules. And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, that begs your 

adversary's question, which is every case has one or 

more differences in it. At what point does a lower 

court have to -- can it say, you know, yes, because they 

exercised discretion sometimes but not others it's still 

an independent State ground to find forfeiture?

 MR. LAWRY: There -- there are several 

things that are important in this kind of situation. 

One is how -- it's really how is the rule being applied. 

And if -- if the rule is -- if there is a situation 

where -- where in the vast majority of cases the rule is 

being applied to deny review and there are occasional 

acts of grace, that's one thing. It's very different 

when almost every time the situation comes up review is 

allowed and then in the occasional exception, without 

explanation, it's taken away.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, following 

up on that, I'd like your answer to this question: Is a 

State procedural rule automatically inadequate and, 

therefore, unenforceable when the State rule is 

discretionary rather than mandatory? Automatically?

 MR. LAWRY: No, it is not automatically

inadequate.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you agree --

MR. LAWRY: It's not our position --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you agree with 

the Petitioner's response to that question? Their 

point -- their question presented is, is it 

automatically inadequate because there is discretion? 

They say no, you say no.

 MR. LAWRY: And we don't think that the --

that the Third Circuit said --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that was 

the same -- that was the position you took in your 

opposition to certiorari.

 MR. LAWRY: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And yet we 

nonetheless granted -- granted cert.

 MR. LAWRY: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if some of 

us -- or I suppose if several of us -- think that that 

may have been or was what the Third Circuit said, would 

you have any objection to us vacating the opinion, 

explaining since you both agree that the rule is not 

automatically inadequate, make sure they understand 

that, and then they can proceed however they see fit?

that, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Insofar as the ongoing 

rule is concerned, let's assume that as of the time of 

Doctor, which was a Third Circuit case, 1996, the 

Pennsylvania rule was then clear, Pennsylvania for the 

first time having made its rule clear. Would it be 

improper to apply it to this defendant, because he 

escaped before Doctor made it clear? I -- I just don't 

understand why the general rules of -- of -- of waiver 

apply in this case. It -- it doesn't affect rational 

conduct. It doesn't trap an attorney. Why can't we 

take the rule as it was when we heard his case after he 

had been returned as a fugitive?

 MR. LAWRY: Well, part of the problem here 

is that -- that Pennsylvania law and what the 

Pennsylvania rule is was a moving target throughout this 

time period. There was the -- the discretionary sort of 

regime under Galloway which -- which did hold as Doctor 

describes it. Then there was a time period when there 

was absolute forfeiture. Then there was another time 

period where they backed away from that.

 And so that -- that kind of shifting, of 

turning procedural rules on and off, is the antithesis 

of consistent application of rules.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that may be, but

where -- where do you get that from the opinion of the 

court of appeals here? I find it very easy to get from 

the opinion of the court of appeals the proposition that 

if there is discretion, it's not a firmly established 

rule.

 Where do you get your theory, that they had 

changed it from a discretionary rule to a mandatory rule 

at the time that the State court made this ruling? 

Where do you find that in the opinion of the court of 

appeals?

 MR. LAWRY: Well, I -- I would -- I would 

acknowledge that it's a bit cryptic, but I think because 

the Third Circuit in Kindler said that Doctor is what's 

controlling in its analysis, I think you really have to 

read it in light of Doctor. And Doctor makes very clear 

that what the Third Circuit was looking at there was a 

change from a discretionary rule to a mandatory rule.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So they are going to say, I 

imagine below -- I'm not sure -- say: Look, that's 

right, and Doctor talked about the shift from mandatory 

to discretionary, and the district court -- the State, 

in Doctor, said that it was a mandatory -- it's 

mandatory.

 But in this case, the district court said 

it's discretionary. So insofar as there are two rules

-- or were at the time, your client got the benefit of 

the most liberal, and, therefore, insofar as there is a 

difference, it made no difference.

 MR. LAWRY: Well, actually our client didn't 

get the benefit of a number of things that were clearly 

established law in Pennsylvania at the time.

 First off, there was the policy of relaxed 

waiver that applied to all capital cases and meant 

merits review of all issues. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's -- that's a 

different issue. Now, your -- your assertion is that 

what the court of appeals was based on -- decision 

was -- was not this that you are arguing now, but 

rather, it was based on the fact that there had been a 

change in the law from discretionary to mandatory.

 I can't find that, frankly, in the opinion, 

except in its reference to Doctor, so I have got to go 

back and read Doctor and guess that that's what they 

meant when they referred to Doctor.

 But assuming it's true, Justice Breyer says, 

even if it is true, what difference does it make? 

Because, even if they had changed from a discretionary 

to a mandatory, the trial court in the State had not 

realized that they had changed and gave him the 

discretionary.

So what -- what complaint do you have?

 MR. LAWRY: Well, it's not even clear, 

really, what -- what the trial court was applying, but I 

think that there are -- there are a number of serious 

problems with -- with the consistent application in this 

case.

 If you want to look for just the most 

obvious ones, Reginald Lewis, a capital defendant, and 

Mr. Kindler escaped together, at the same time, the same 

day, together. Mr. Lewis got complete full review, 

merits review, of all of his issues on direct appeal, 

all of his issues in post-conviction. Mr. Kindler got 

no review.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And that 

is -- your objection is that it wasn't fairly applied. 

Discretion was abused in this case, to borrow from the 

Federal law. They didn't treat them the same. They 

should have treated them the same.

 But the question is whether the rule is 

automatically inadequate if there is discretion. You 

are arguing about how it was applied, which I guess 

means that it's not automatically inadequate because if 

they apply it the way you think it should be then it 

would be adequate.

thought there. I apologize.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe I did, too.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. LAWRY: No. I don't think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the point is you 

are arguing about the application -- the exercise of 

discretion. You say the one guy, Lewis, got the benefit 

of the rule; your guy didn't get the benefit of the 

rule; and that's unfair, right?

 MR. LAWRY: That's -- that's part of what 

I'm arguing. Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are not 

arguing -- which would be very odd to argue -- that the 

discretion always makes the rule invalid because you --

MR. LAWRY: No. We are not -- we are not 

arguing that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do I -- Do I take it 

that -- that Justice -- Justice Breyer's question, 

repeated by Justice Scalia -- just take that fact, 

that's the only question before us. If it was 

discretionary and it's now mandatory, just focus on that 

only.

it's like Ford or any of the other cases where -- where 

the rules are being changed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: If -- if the new rule was 

applied to him.

 MR. LAWRY: Yes.

rule wasn't applied to him. The trial court thought 

that it had discretion.

 MR. LAWRY: Well, yes --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's clear from the trial 

court's opinion, isn't it?

 MR. LAWRY: Okay. But -- but what I'm 

focusing on is what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did, 

and they did a number of things.

 Another thing that the Pennsylvania Supreme 

Court did was they said, in the direct appeal opinion, 

Mr. Kindler's flight makes his case like somebody who 

affirmatively goes and gives up his direct appeal 

altogether. All right.

affirmatively gave up their direct appeals altogether,

relief, they got full post-conviction review in the 

Pennsylvania courts. When Mr. Kindler went, he got no 

review.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: By whom?

 MR. LAWRY: By any -- I'm sorry. By either 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no. Stop.

 Is the relaxed waiver rule one that applies 

to district court consideration or appellate court 

consideration or both?

 MR. LAWRY: It applies at all levels.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At all levels. What is 

your reading of what the new rule that the State was 

announcing was announcing? That it was doing away with 

the State court's relaxed waiver rule? Was it doing it 

away with its own relaxed waiver rule? What's your 

position in this case?

 MR. LAWRY: The -- the State courts simply 

did not apply relaxed waiver to Mr. Kindler.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: None of them, including 

the trial court?

 MR. LAWRY: Including -- including the trial 

court, yes. Mr. Kindler asked for relaxed -- in fact, 

when the Commonwealth initially moved to dismiss his 

post-verdict motions, the Commonwealth said: We know

there is this relaxed waiver out there, so if you -- if 

you don't dismiss his post-verdict motions entirely, at 

least dismiss the guilt phase and consider his issues 

with regard to capital sentencing. The Commonwealth 

said that.

 So -- so the -- so there's -- there's no 

question that -- that, on the PCRA appeal, what the 

Pennsylvania Supreme Court applied was a mandatory rule. 

They said it's forfeited, no review whatsoever, and --

and that would be the difference --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: By the trial court and 

by us, is that what you're --

MR. LAWRY: Yes, yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: How would you fill in this 

sentence? I'm beginning where the Chief Justice did. 

Say everybody said: Look, this opinion is at least 

unclear. It's -- everybody agrees that the simple 

existence of discretion does not make a State ground 

inadequate, so we send it back for you now. And you 

will have some good arguments, I guarantee each side 

will have some good arguments, as to whether they were 

being consistent or not, whether there was a consistent 

rule or not.

 MR. LAWRY: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, next sentence, which

maybe would never be written: This is not to say that 

discretion automatically means it's adequate, for it 

could be applied inconsistently.

 Now, there could be another sentence, 

because that other sentence would have to go on to the 

fact that any discretionary rule will never be applied 

with perfect consistency or anywhere near it. That 

would be true if you give a trial judge the choice in 

his discretion to waive a -- a time limit ruling.

 Some will do it with one. Some will do it 

in the other. You can't do it perfectly. So is there 

any sentence we could put in there? So you hedged on 

there, and probably they will, too, because it's very 

hard to find the right sentence.

 You don't want the simple application of 

discretion, you say -- which inevitably means some 

inconsistency, to make a State rule inadequate. On the 

other hand, they can't go too far. So what is too far?

 MR. LAWRY: Well, I would -- I would 

actually direct you to Judge Harlan's opinion in 

Sullivan, where he says: "A court has an obligation to 

be reasonably consistent and to explain the decision, 

including the reason for according different treatment 

to the instant case." But that never happened --

trial Supreme Court -- a Supreme Court in a State is 

supervising lots of trial courts, and you will have 

different human beings sitting there as judges, and they 

will inevitably be inconsistent with each other to some 

degree. Have you not noticed that?

 MR. LAWRY: Certainly.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: So is there anything we can 

say that will improve the situation? That's why I 

started out by saying maybe the best thing is to say 

nothing.

 MR. LAWRY: Well, the -- the key is really 

consistent application and -- and looking to see whether 

the rules are being turned off and on.

 Like I would -- I would point the Court to 

Barr v. City of Columbia, which I think is a very good 

example, where there is maybe five people who make the 

same objection, and four of them get merits review, and 

the other person doesn't get merits review. Now, maybe 

there's some explanation somewhere for that, but this 

Court said: You know, this is not what we call 

adequacy; this is not consistent application.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the problem --

Justice Stevens' question brought this up. I mean, how 

do you address that question if you don't have very many

applications of the rule?

 MR. LAWRY: Well, it's certainly --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Say it's the first 

one that comes up.

 MR. LAWRY: Well, it would certainly help to 

give a -- a reasoned explanation of what's happening. 

There -- you -- you're not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but your 

reasoned explanation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But all -- all those books 

on our wall are the first time it's ever come up. I 

mean, that's how the law -- that's how the law is made. 

So -- the whole point of the adequate independent State 

ground, it seems to me, is part we don't want to affect 

rational conduct retroactively -- not applicable here. 

Two, we don't want to have the State court use this as a 

subterfuge or a device to avoid a Federal right. I 

don't think that's applicable here. You might want to 

argue about that.

 So it seems to me that the fact that it's a 

completely new rule in the case of an escape may mean it 

is still an adequate ground.

 MR. LAWRY: Well, I would -- I certainly 

would argue that there -- there is every reason to see a 

potential for the State seeking to avoid Federal review.

Look at the relaxed waiver cases in the attachment to 

the brief. There are 51 cases over a 20-year period 

where the State courts reviewed every single issue on 

the merits in a capital case, regardless of what 

happened below.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And they concluded that was 

ridiculous, so they stopped doing it.

 MR. LAWRY: But -- but during the time 

period, during the relevant time period in Mr. Kindler's 

-- from his escape all the way through his PCRA 

proceedings, that was the rule. And then they changed 

it, which is similar to -- to some of the other things 

that we see in this case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But those weren't escape 

cases. Were they all escape cases?

 MR. LAWRY: Oh, no. No.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's the point. 

Why isn't escape sui generis, and how can we ever say 

that?

 MR. LAWRY: Well, but -- but if you want to 

look at what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court actually 

said here, they said Mr. Kindler's case is in the 

category like people who affirmatively waive. Okay, 

that's what they said on direct appeal. Then you look 

in PCRA, on the PCRA appeal, and they don't treat him

like the people who affirmatively waive. That's not 

consistent application.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You don't doubt that 

it would be an independent and adequate State rule to 

say whenever anybody escapes they waive their claims?

 MR. LAWRY: That -- certainly, going forward 

that's -- that's an adequate rule, yes.

 Another -- another aspect --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what's the interest 

in not applying this in this case? As you say, that's a 

fine rule. If you are a fugitive, you are out. You say 

that wasn't the rule at the time he escaped. But you 

are not asserting any reliance interest by the escapee, 

that, gee, if I knew that the rule was going to be 

mandatory, I wouldn't have a chance to appeal to the 

discretion, I wouldn't have escaped.

 There is no -- there is no absence of notice 

that -- that matters. I mean, if he had notice he would 

have still escaped, I assume.

 MR. LAWRY: Yes, but the -- the issue here 

is not solely about notice to Mr. Kindler. There is an 

issue also about evasion of Federal review. That goes 

right back to Ward, in like 1920, talking about State 

courts seeking to take away this Court's jurisdiction by

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you just said that it 

would be okay to have a rule going forward that if you 

are a fugitive, you are out.

 MR. LAWRY: But that -- but that's if it's a 

firmly established rule that is consistently. And 

that's not what we see here. And let me give you 

another example of that. Even in a noncapital case, the 

Pennsylvania Supreme Court never held that a 

presentencing flight meant that the defendant would get 

no post-conviction review. They -- they affirmatively 

rejected that idea in Commonwealth v. Huff. But for 

Mr. Kindler they said a presentencing flight means no 

post-conviction review. Put simply --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is -- what is 

the Federal fugitive rule?

 MR. LAWRY: The Federal fugitive rule is --

that was set in Ortega-Rodriguez -- says that a flight 

presentencing does not take away your appellate rights. 

It says that the district court has discretion how it 

would want to deal with that. It also --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Has discretion?

 MR. LAWRY: It has discretion. It says, you 

know, the blunderbuss of dismissal is not -- is not an 

appropriate -- is not usually an appropriate device, 

because there are a lot of other things the district

courts can do short of taking away all appellate rights, 

no review by any court anywhere.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does the discretion 

that the Pennsylvania courts have here -- is that 

similar? Can the Pennsylvania Supreme Courts exercise 

that discretion in a calibrated way, not all or nothing?

 MR. LAWRY: They -- they certainly could.

 The -- one of the things that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Were you still answering 

the Chief Justice's -- I had -- had one more.

 MR. LAWRY: No.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I didn't mean to 

interrupt.

 You said there was no post-conviction 

review. I -- I thought they in this case went on to 

ask -- to exercise a limited review. They didn't reach 

the Mills v. Maryland point, but they did give a limited 

review to determine the sufficiency of the evidence, 

whether the death penalty was a product of passion or 

prejudice, whether the evidence fails to support the 

finding of the aggravating circumstance, whether the 

sentence was extensive or proportional. They did give 

post --

MR. LAWRY: -conviction review.

all those points.

 MR. LAWRY: Well, those were -- those were 

direct appeal things that they looked at, yes. The --

the -- those are part of the statutory appellate review 

for capital cases in Pennsylvania.

 As far as I am aware, nobody has ever gotten 

relief from that statutorily mandated direct appeal 

review. But in post-conviction, they -- they gave no 

review at all to the post-conviction claims, including 

the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is a certain irony 

that the case you're relying on on the merits is Mills, 

where if he hadn't escaped he would have gone through 

the whole process before Mills was decided.

 MR. LAWRY: Well, but he may well have 

gotten relief anyway. He raised -- he actually raised 

an objection, a Mills-type objection at trial. It was 

raised in the post-verdict motions. It would presumably 

have been raised on direct appeal. And -- and if it had 

been so raised on direct appeal he could have -- and he 

didn't win on direct appeal, he could have sought 

post-conviction relief in Pennsylvania based on the fact 

that Mills came down later, because the Pennsylvania 

retroactivity rule is that you can get retroactive 

application of a decision if you -- if you objected. If

you raised the issue earlier and a new decision comes 

down that would help you, you can raise that later.

 So the idea of a windfall that was raised in 

the Commonwealth's brief doesn't -- he didn't get a 

windfall. He didn't get any review in State court, and 

there's also of course the ineffective assistance of 

counsel claim. The law has not changed on the 

ineffective assistance of counsel claim.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, he got the 

windfall of being free for eight years, right? I guess 

that gets back to the point of your friend, which is he 

is in no worse position because he escaped and spent 

eight years on the lam than if he had stayed in prison.

 MR. LAWRY: He is in much worse position. 

He -- he just -- he just had all -- all review taken 

away in the State courts and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. Obviously 

if the State prevails he's in a worse position. But 

under your view, he's in this -- he's in no worse 

position. He hasn't waived all his objections and 

claims, procedures.

 MR. LAWRY: Well, there are certainly other 

things that the State can do. They can -- they can 

prosecute him criminally for escape. There is 

administrative confinement, those kinds of things. But

there is really --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Before or after his 

execution?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. LAWRY: Well, there -- this -- this 

Court said in Ortega-Rodriguez that -- that increasing 

somebody's sentence by a number of years based on escape 

would introduce an element of arbitrariness and 

irrationality, and -- and certainly changing the 

sentence from life to death based on disrespect to the 

courts seems like a fairly -- a fairly serious 

consequence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I'm sorry, if 

I could just nail down the point. As far as his rights 

and proceedings in this case, he is in no worse position 

under your theory having escaped and been out for 

eight years than if he had stayed put?

 MR. LAWRY: In -- in Federal court if it's 

held, as we argue, that the State court rulings were not 

adequate, that's true. And their argument is he should 

be executed with no review by any court.

 I do want to return for a minute to relaxed 

waiver because, you know, the primary argument that I 

heard was that in 1984 at the time of the escape that 

relaxed waiver wasn't that firmly established. That's

simply not true. There are four decisions applying 

relaxed waiver prior to 1984, and those decisions held 

that a person who affirmatively waived a constitutional 

issue -- I see my time is up.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Finish your 

sentence.

 MR. LAWRY: There -- okay. There are four 

cases and in every case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court 

gave full merits review to all issues, even issues that 

were only first raised at oral argument.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I please --

MR. LAWRY: Sure.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you pick 1984 as the 

time of the escape? Whether it's an adequate or 

independent State ground, whether it's been consistently 

applied, it seemed to me -- it seems to me you should 

look to the time at which the State rule is applied.

 Now, as of 1984 I suppose there are some 

notice requirements that you can say due process 

requires, but I don't know why the adequacy of the State 

ground, whether it's consistently applied, should be 

judged on the basis of what was the law in 1984, rather 

than what was the State law at the time they applied the 

rule.

question about whether that is introducing a novel rule. 

But -- but I was -- in the comments I was just making, I 

was principally addressing the Commonwealth's argument 

that relaxed waiver wasn't that well established in 

1984.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD EISENBERG

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. EISENBERG: Mr. Lawry's answer to the 

question about a mandatory forfeiture rule, Your Honors, 

I think is the crucial one here. When asked whether an 

automatic mandatory forfeiture rule would be adequate, 

he said yes. And I think that's the problem with just 

trying to remand this case without doing more, because 

that's where you wind up.

 If the lower Federal courts continue to 

undertake the kind of consistency analysis that they 

think consistency requires, it will drive that sort of 

discretion out, and you will wind up with forfeiture 

rules and other State procedural rules that are all 

automatic, because that's the way the Federal courts 

will be telling the State courts that their rules will 

be found adequate State grounds and enforceable on 

Federal habeas corpus review.

There was no subterfuge here the -- to avoid 

or evade the Federal question. The argument in favor of 

that position is: Look at all the other cases where the 

State court did address Federal constitutional 

questions. Well, exactly. Of course we did in many 

other capital cases. And the -- the penalty for trying 

to be lenient in those other cases is that now in the 

worst case we can't apply any sort of forfeiture, any 

sort of procedural bar, even for a guy who breaks out of 

jail twice. The State court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what about his --

his colleague who broke out with him? How do you -- how 

do you explain that.

 MR. EISENBERG: That defendant was gone less 

than two weeks. And, so, we withdrew our motion to 

quash his appeal. It's not just that the State court 

didn't grant it, we withdrew it because he was 

recaptured in New York two weeks later.

 This guy was out for seven years. After he 

was captured the first time in Canada and started to 

fight extradition, his post verdict motions were 

dismissed. The motions that he had been -- and told him 

that under state law at that time were absolutely 

essential to preserving any claim for further review, 

and his response to the dismissal of his post verdict

motions after the first escape was to break out of jail 

again a second time.

 During the second escape, somebody died, 

another prisoner fell to his death. During the first 

escape the plan, the diversion that allowed this 

defendant to sneak out through the window he sought 

through was to have a riot staged on the part of the 

other prisoners, during which they tried to push one of 

the prison guards off the third tier of the prison cells 

to the floor below. That would -- that caused all the 

other guards to rush up. During that time the defendant 

slipped out the window.

 That's why this was the case where the court 

exercised its discretion to impose a procedural bar. 

Mr. Lawry says, well, the Commonwealth just wants to 

execute him without any sort of review.

 He did have limited review, as Justice 

Kennedy pointed out, but really you are left with only 

the two choices of imposing a procedural bar, a bar that 

this Court said was longstanding and well established in 

American law in Estelle v. Dorrough --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask --

defendant better off than he would otherwise have been.

We have all been somewhat trouble because some ambiguity 

in the opinion below. What if we -- I think your 

opponent answered this question. What if we were to say 

that the answer to the question presented, in italics in 

your brief is no? And send it back to the court of 

appeals and tell them whether they -- that would change 

their decision or not.

 Would you agree that were a proper 

disposition.

 MR. EISENBERG: No, Justice Stevens. I 

think the reason the case is worth being here is to 

provide greater guidance than to that provide to the

weighed in on this question --

rule. And if you say there isn't, doesn't that give
