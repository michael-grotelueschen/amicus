 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in case 06-376, Hinck vs. United States.

 Mr. Redding.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. REDDING

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. REDDING: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Federal Circuit's opinion is simply 

wrong. Enactment of Section 6404(h) did not repeal 

district court and Court of Federal Claims refund 

jurisdiction over interest by the Internal Revenue 

Service. Both circuits have found that there was 

pre-existing jurisdiction prior to the enactment of 

Section 6406(h). Nothing in Section 6404(h) expressly 

repeals that jurisdiction, and there are many instances 

in the code where Congress when it does intend to 

expressly limit jurisdiction, will state that in the 

enabling statute. Reference to the tax court, specific 

reference to the tax court in 6404(h) was mandated 

unnecessary by Section 7442 and the nature of the tax 

court. The tax court is only given jurisdiction over 

those matters where it is specifically set out in the 

tax code.

And the established framework of pay and sue 

jurisdiction in the district courts and prepayment 

jurisdiction in the tax court is a well established 

framework for tax litigation. That has been accepted 

and enunciated by this Court as far back as the Flora 

opinions. It's a well established pattern of duality of 

jurisdiction in the two forums.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But not with respect 

to abatement of interest in particular.

 MR. REDDING: Not with respect to abatement 

of interest, Your Honor, but as a general basis. The 

availability of a prepayment forum that was originally 

enacted to be complementary to the ability to pay and 

sue in order to protect smaller taxpayers, and avoid the 

hardships faced by having to pay in full before having 

access to refund jurisdiction, and in fact perhaps to 

avoid bankruptcy. That is completely consistent with 

the way this section is enacted. Section 6404(h) even 

includes the limitation that only taxpayers with a net 

worth below $2 million or corporations below $7 million 

have prepayment access to the tax court. And abatement 

by itself is generally a prepayment remedy.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's a -- on that 

point, Mr. Redding, it seems odd that given this 

tripartite system, Congress would want only the tax

court to be restricted in the people who could claim the 

abatement, the net worth test applicable in the tax 

court on your theory, if there is authority in the 

claims court and in the district courts, they're not 

limited to the net worth restrictions.

 MR. REDDING: That is correct, Your Honor, 

but I do believe that it is consistent with the intent 

of the formation of the tax court to provide a 

prepayment forum to especially avoid hardship and the 

potential even of bankruptcy. It's very consistent with 

that pattern to say that the larger taxpayer can afford 

to pay the tax and sue, whereas the smaller taxpayer may 

be in greater need of a prepayment forum. It's also 

consistent with imposing the very short limitation 

period for bringing an action in the tax court, because 

there the government has a very vested interest in being 

able to proceed with collection of the tax.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But why would you 

not want some -- a larger taxpayer to be able to proceed 

in the tax court if you can also proceed in the claims 

court?

 MR. REDDING: Your Honor, I can't speak to 

Congress's reasoning behind that but I can understand 

the logic behind saying we're going to create a special 

prepayment remedy that allows the smaller taxpayer an

expedited means of resolving these issues without having 

to first pay it and sue, whereas the larger taxpayer is 

not put into a hardship position, is not inconvenienced 

as bad by having to follow the old well established 

procedures of pay and sue.

 And I will note that 6404(h) does not apply 

only to 6404(e)(1), which is the subsection we're coming 

under. 6404(h) applies to all of the abatement grounds 

under Section 6404. And if we were to repeal 

jurisdiction in the district court and the Court of 

Federal Claims over all of those provisions, then we 

would be completely taking away a remedy that has been 

there all along to the larger taxpayers. But to create 

a new remedy that is consistent with the pattern that 

allows a small taxpayer access to a prepayment forum, I 

think is completely consistent with the entire history 

of this court. This court meaning the tax court. And 

its purpose.

 In evaluating two statutes that appear to 

either conflict or overlap, I think it is, in reviewing 

whatever doctrine you call it, whatever canon you call 

it of interpretation, it appears to me that what this 

Court has always done is to look to see if the two 

statutes can be harmonized rather than seeing if one 

supersedes the other. And here considering the

extension of prepayment jurisdiction to the tax court 

merely an additional form of prepayment jurisdiction 

being granted to the tax court is completely consistent 

with the long-standing pattern of pay and sue 

jurisdiction in the district courts, prepayment 

jurisdiction in the tax court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you have no 

basis for an abatement of interest action apart from 

6404(h), correct? That is the only place you get the 

actual cause of action to sue for abatement of interest?

 MR. REDDING: Abatement as a prepayment 

remedy, yes, Your Honor. Once the IRS has failed to 

abate the interest and you make payment then you have 

the normal refund, refund provisions available.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what would you 

cite to, in response to the prior cases that said you 

had no cause of action for abasement of interest?

 MR. REDDING: Actually Your Honor I don't 

believe that's what the cases said. They said you had 

no cause of action that could be pursued under 

6404(e)(1) but even the seminal cases, Horton -- or 

Selman and Horton Homes compared a Section 6404(e)(1) 

action to a Section 6404(e)(2) action and basically said 

you could have brought a refund claim. If you qualified 

under (e)(2) there would have been no impediment to

bringing that as a refund action because there was a 

clearly established standard. The (e)(2) provision is a 

must standard.

 Now, under 6404(h) if it is exclusive over 

abatement jurisdiction, then any taxpayer who would have 

had access to the courts, for example for an (e)(2) 

abatement case, unless they are a small taxpayer they 

will be completely denied any remedy whatsoever.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is (e)(2)? Is it 

produced in these materials. I got (e)(1); I don't have 

(e)(2). I don't really like talking about a section I 

don't have in front of me.

 MR. REDDING: I believe all of 6404 was in 

the appendix but I don't have it in front of me.

 Yeah. It's -- it's immediate, in the code section 

it's immediately below (e)(1).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ah.

 MR. REDDING: But I mean -- I'm sorry, Your 

Honor. That doesn't help you --

(Laughter.)

 MR. REDDING: -- where it is in the 

materials.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's one thing about this 

case I'm sure about.

MR. REDDING: I apologize, Your Honor, but I 

do not have that. It is in the appendix to the 

petition, the entire code section is set out.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that the one that says 

interest abated with respect to erroneous refund check? 

Or am I reading wrong?

 MR. REDDING: Yes, Sir, it is.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the one I'm 

looking at just has (e)(1). Did you have a page number?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: At page 42 of the appendix, 

all -- all there is is a subsection 1.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.

 MR. REDDING: Well, Your Honor, I have the 

code section in front of me now but I still do not have 

the reference in the appendix. I apologize but I simply 

don't have it, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can I go back to 

something you just said, that I thought you said that 

the people would have no remedy if the tax court -- were 

the only forum for abatement claims? And it would be 

the exclusive forum but nobody -- it wouldn't deny 

access to anyone.

 MR. REDDING: Your Honor --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Abatement claim, if you 

read this as the Government does, is one place where you

go, and the tax court but everyone who has an abatement 

claim could go there. So who's being cut out?

 MR. REDDING: Well no, Your Honor, everyone 

cannot go there. You can only go there if you're a 

taxpayer, an individual taxpayer with a net worth of 

less than $2 million.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Oh, yes. But -- yes. 

And I had asked you before well doesn't it seem, it 

seems strange that Congress would want to limit the 

authority of the, of the court where most people go and 

have no limit for the wealthier taxpayers.

 MR. REDDING: Your Honor, again, my, my view 

of that is the Congress intended to limit the special 

relief of prepayment jurisdiction to the smaller 

taxpayers. But the availability of a pay and sue remedy 

was already in existence and continues in existence and 

those wealthier taxpayers generally can afford to pay 

the liability in full and sue.

 A prepayment forum which delays the 

collection of the tax to the Government, you know, the 

Government has a special interest there in restricting 

access to that relief so that it can proceed with 

collection. And again, it just makes logical sense that 

as to a larger taxpayer the ability to pay and sue 

should be a sufficient remedy. Generally speaking --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Congress was 

operating on the assumption that no court could hear an 

abatement claim?

 MR. REDDING: Your Honor, that comes largely 

from the legislative history, the House Committee report 

addressing interestingly, subsection (h). And 

subsection (h) since it applies only to prepayment 

abatement claims specifically, I think then you, then 

that legislative history makes sense. Because in that 

same page in the legislative history --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, give me a decision 

of the claims court or a district court that said courts 

have authority to abate the interest before Congress 

enacted this legislation?

 MR. REDDING: I don't believe there is a 

specific case out there that I can cite to you where it 

has happened. It is, it is reflected in both Horton 

Homes and Selman that that availability existed with 

respect to (e)(2) to --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it fair to say that 

Congress acted on the assumption that there was no right 

to the abatement with, and to the payment unless it 

enacted the statutes?

 MR. REDDING: Your Honor, I don't believe 

so. Again, because that legislative history that's

referred to is restricted, the House Committee report is 

restricted only to the subsection creating the tax court 

prepayment jurisdiction. It is not relevant to the rest 

of the amendments to Section 6404. And I note that in 

doing so Congress also did not make the restriction on 

the $2 million/$7 million net worth relative to the 

rights being granted under the other provisions of 6404.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's easy to see why the 

only cases you have relate to (e)(2) rather than (e)(1). 

(E)(2) which we don't have in the materials, but I have 

gotten a copy of it.

 And (e)(1) says that the Secretary "may" 

abate the assessment of all or any part. And those 

cases that denied it said this is discretionary; he 

doesn't have to. (E)(2) on the other hand, interest 

abated with respect to erroneous refund check, says the 

Secretary "shall" abate the assessment. So really, 

(e)(2) doesn't -- doesn't do you any good at all with 

respect to whether there was a cause of action before 

(h) was adopted.

 MR. REDDING: Well -- Your Honor, I 

respectfully disagree because 6404(h) applies to (e)(2) 

as much as it does to (e)(1). And any taxpayer that 

would have met the net worth requirements or whether or 

not they met the net worth requirements that are now in

H, could have brought a refund suit under (e)(2) 

previously.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, sure. But --

but that's just saying, if -- you used to have the 

entitlement under (e)(2) and you're saying well, you 

could bring cases under (e)(2). But 6404(h) allows you 

to bring cases under (e)(1). It would follow a fortiori 

that you could bring them for (e)(2) as well, but that 

doesn't prove that you could prove them under (e)(1) in 

the claims court or the district court.

 MR. REDDING: No it does not, Your Honor. 

What I'm trying to address is the intent to repeal the 

pre-existing jurisdiction, again because 6404(h) does 

not apply just to (e)(1), where the might be a question 

about whether or not they could have brought the case 

previously, although jurisdiction existed. Clearly they 

could have brought their case under (e)(2).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. What you're say is 

that cases that used to be bringable under (e)(2) would 

now be bringable only under (h) which would in effect be 

an implicit repeal of (e)(2).

 MR. REDDING: Of (e)(2) --

JUSTICE SCALIA: At least as far as suits 

elsewhere than in the tax court.

 MR. REDDING: That's correct. And

additionally limit it solely to the small taxpayer. The 

larger taxpayer who had a prior remedy would have none.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It seems to apply just to 

abuse of discretion.

 MR. REDDING: I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE BREYER:: Doesn't the new statute 

just apply to abuse of discretion?

 MR. REDDING: No, Your Honor, it does not. 

It creates the standard under which the tax court may 

review any interest abatement claim under Section --

JUSTICE BREYER: It says you have 

jurisdiction to determine whether it's an abusive 

discretion. Maybe I'm reading the wrong place. 6404 --

MR. REDDING: Yes, Your Honor, that is the 

standard it applies to.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. Well that standard 

doesn't apply to the (e)(2). It has nothing to do with 

it; (e)(2) says if it's a refund, abate, if not, not. 

It's not a question of abuse of discretion or not.

 MR. REDDING: Well I think it's the standard 

on which they are to review the Government's action. 

And I believe I cannot cite the case but there are cases 

that hold that a violation of law is a per se abuse of 

discretion. There are also other subsections --

subsections under 6404 which are made provisions in

other 6404 subsections, which are must provisions. 

There are about five different subsections under 6404 

that provide for interest abatement.

 Again, I come back to the long-established 

pattern of having prepayment jurisdiction in the tax 

court and postpayment refund jurisdiction in the 

district courts and Court of Federal Claims. It's a 

well established system, and adding a new prepayment 

form of relief into the tax court in no way should be 

implied to be a repeal of the long established refund --

pay and sue refund jurisdiction that normally exists.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if you went into 

the district court and claimed that the failure to abate 

interest was an abuse of discretion, what would you rely 

on for the -- for the cause of action?

 MR. REDDING: If the failure to abate 

interest was an abuse of discretion under (e)(1) you 

would rely on (e)(1) for the cause of action. The right 

is created by the other subsections of (h) of 6404.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought the prior 

cases consistently, consistently said that there was no 

judicial review because it was "may abate" and that it 

was only with the arrival of 6404(h)(1) that there was a 

cause of action for abuse of discretion?

 MR. REDDING: Yes, Your Honor, but I believe

what they actually said is that there was jurisdiction 

to hear it but there was not a justiciable standard that 

could be applied with regard to (e)(1). However, once 

Congress came in and says to the tax court you're going 

to apply this standard, there is a standard of review. 

That now indicates Congress did not intend it to be 

solely discretionary, and that the district court or 

Court of Federal Claims would look to the general common 

law; it would look to precedents, such as the APAA abuse 

of discretion standard is consistently used throughout 

the court systems in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you want to look 

at 6404(h)(1) saying now we have a standard, but you 

don't want the other stuff that goes along with 

6404(h)(1), which is it's in the tax court; you got to 

have less than ten million, blah, blah, blah?

 MR. REDDING: That is correct, Your Honor. 

The abuse of discretion standard is a common law 

standard which has been carried over into -- into this 

statute. But to create a --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it didn't exist 

before this statute? I mean, the lower courts as I 

understand it said, routinely, yes, you can have 

jurisdiction, but have you no claim for relief because 

there is no, no law to apply. This is a totally

discretionary matter of the Commissioner's grace. So 

Congress perhaps didn't grasp the subtle distinction 

between no jurisdiction, and you can walk in the door 

but you go out the next door, because there is no 

justiciable claim. And it provided peculiarly in the 

tax court for relief that was not available anyplace 

before?

 MR. REDDING: I understand and that's 

basically the Fifth Circuit's view, Your Honor. I do 

not agree with that view. I think that the Congress was 

merely expanding the existing structure of prepayment 

jurisdiction for the tax court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Fifth Circuit -- I 

thought the Fifth Circuit went your way.

 MR. REDDING: Pardon?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the Fifth 

Circuit went your way.

 MR. REDDING: It did, Your Honor. I'm 

sorry. The Federal Circuit analyzed it as you have. I 

do not believe that that is the correct analysis. I 

think the Fifth Circuit has this one right. What you 

have is a grant of jurisdiction to the United States Tax 

Court for a prepayment forum of relief which is 

consistent with the existing pattern, and in no other 

instance where that has been done has there been an

implied repeal.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. -- Mr. Redding, let me 

come back to the phantom (e)(2) which we have finally 

traced down.

 MR. REDDING: I apologize, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I am not sure that (h) 

would impliedly repeal (e)(2), because (e)(2) is 

mandatory. There isn't any question under (e)(2) 

whether there has been an abuse of discretion. There is 

no discretion. It is mandatory to the extent that the 

Administrative Procedure Act would govern (e)(2), it 

would be for a violation of law not for abuse of 

discretion.

 So when (h) says the tax court shall have 

jurisdiction to determine whether the Secretary's 

failure to abate interest was an abuse of discretion, I 

would take that to apply only to (e)(1), which says the 

Secretary may abate and not to (e)(2) which says the 

Secretary shall abate. There is no question of -- of 

discretion in (e)(2) at all.

 MR. REDDING: I understand that argument, 

Your Honor. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It was a pretty good 

argument, I thought.

MR. REDDING: I agree, Your Honor. I would 

note to the Court, though, that 6404(d) is also a 

may-abate provision which is in the code. 6404(a) is 

also a permissive abatement provision, and those 

provisions would clearly be covered by it. I, when it 

says it may, may review a failure to abate interest 

under 6404, I read that as encompassing all of 6404 and 

creating their standard for review. I do not review 

that as a new standard that applies.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What about those other 

sections, (c) and (d), which say the Secretary is 

authorized? Have there been cases which, which said 

that you could sue for, for his failure to make use of 

that?

 MR. REDDING: Your Honor, I've been able to 

find no case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the same as with (e)?

 MR. REDDING: Yes Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: As with (e)(1).

 MR. REDDING: Yes, Your Honor. There's no 

clearly history of cases.

 I would also submit, Your Honor, that 

because of the established pattern of pay and sue versus 

prepayment jurisdiction and the necessity to make a 

specific reference to the tax court in any grant of

jurisdiction in the tax code in order to enable the tax 

court to have jurisdiction, that if this is the ruling 

of this Court with regard to 6404(h), it is going to 

raise a question every time prepayment jurisdiction is 

extended to the tax court over any matter as to whether 

that somehow now becomes exclusive of the conventional 

pay and sue remedy.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Of course, there's a 

fundamental difference on this particular question 

between pay and sue and sue --

MR. REDDING: Prepay.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- prepay, because 

if you -- in the district court if you're paying and 

suing you're not really subject to the accrual of 

interest, right?

 MR. REDDING: No, Your Honor, that is not 

correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I owe the IRS, 

1,000 dollars and they send me a bill and I paid the 

1,000 dollars, they've got the money, I don't. So I 

don't owe interest on that, do I?

 MR. REDDING: Your Honor, may I reflect it 

back to the facts in this case. The time period with 

respect to which abatement is requested occurs many 

years before the IRS ever sent the taxpayer a bill. The

errors and delays complained of in this case occurred 

during the course of the partnership level examination 

and proceedings. The taxpayer at that time doesn't even 

have a notice of what the adjustments are going to be, 

let alone what his tax liability is. In a partnership 

case, the partnership level determinations are made at 

the partnership level. The Government then, without any 

further notice to the taxpayer, is free to make the 

computation of the taxpayer's liability and send him a 

bill.

 During the pendency of the proceedings at 

the partnership level, there is virtually no way to 

tell, except as to what the outside maximum liability 

might be if the Government prevails, what your liability 

is going to be. And if --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The initial bill 

includes the interest?

 MR. REDDING: Absolutely, Your Honor, that's 

being asked to be relieved of in this case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But still, in the 

tax court situation it's still accruing?

 MR. REDDING: Well, yes. It's accruing 

during the course of the tax court proceeding. And 

again, even there for an individual if the time period 

involved was prior to the assessment the pay, the being

able to pay it and cut off the interest really wouldn't 

make sense.

 Basically, Your Honor, I believe that, I 

believe that this case really rests on what I think the 

Fifth Circuit summarized quite well when it says that it 

makes more sense in this case to simply believe the 

Congress, quote, "simply intended" -- "simply chose to 

extend concurrent jurisdiction to the tax court over a 

certain class of claims." And that's all it really has 

done here. It has implemented and expanded the 

conventional jurisdiction of the tax court as a 

prepayment forum before you do have to pay the liability 

to resolve a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service.

 There is no reason, I don't believe, to see 

this as a major departure from the existing structure of 

pay and sue jurisdiction versus prepayment jurisdiction. 

This is just a well established plan that's been in the 

code for many, many years.

 Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court has no other 

questions I would reserve my remaining time for 

rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Redding.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. MARCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The court of appeals correctly held that the 

tax court has exclusive jurisdiction over actions 

challenging interest abatement determinations under 

Section 6404(e)(1). The language, structure and history 

of the interest abatement review statute supports the 

court of appeals' decision as to principles of sovereign 

immunity. Under Petitioner's theory the specific 

restrictions on the remedy that Congress created may be 

avoided by the simple expedient of filing a challenge in 

another forum. Nothing in the interest abatement review 

statute or this Court's precedent permits that result.

 The place to start is the language of the 

interest abatement review statute. Section 6404(h) 

provides the tax court shall have jurisdiction over an 

interest abatement action brought by taxpayers who meet 

the net worth limitations set out in another part of the 

code and who file their claim within 180 days of the 

Secretary's mailing of a final determination not to 

abate interest.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If, if the history of this 

issue had been such that before the enactment of this 

section the courts of appeals were divided or the courts

were divided as to whether or not there was jurisdiction 

in the Court of Claims and in the district court, would 

your position be different?

 MR. MARCUS: No, our position would be the 

same. We would first look to the statutory language of 

Section 6404(e)(1) and that provision provides that the 

Secretary may abate interest when there is an error or 

delay committed by an IRS employee in the performance of 

a ministerial act, and that "may" language contrasts 

with other provisions that have mandatory language that 

requires the Secretary to abate. In addition, if you 

look at the nature of the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So it's, so it's only (h) 

that gives any court any jurisdiction at all?

 MR. MARCUS: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even though in our 

hypothetical world some courts of general jurisdiction 

thought that they did have jurisdiction?

 MR. MARCUS: That's correct, Justice 

Kennedy. Up until 1986 the IRS didn't even have ability 

to abate in these circumstances.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did (h) apply to (e)(2) as 

well as to (e)(1)? Does it apply only to discretionary 

abatement provisions?

 MR. MARCUS: No, it's our position it

applies only to discretionary abatement determinations 

by the Secretary. The language -- typically when abuse 

of discretion standard is imposed, it presupposes that 

the decision being reviewed involves an exercise of 

discretion.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So what happens with 

(e)(2)? You use the pay and sue provisions?

 MR. MARCUS: Yes, you could use it, although 

it typically comes up when the Government has filed an 

action to recover an erroneous refund. It's usually 

raised as a defense. But you could bring it that way.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, isn't it an abuse --

isn't it an abuse of discretion for the Secretary to 

fail to do what the statute tells him he absolutely 

must?

 MR. MARCUS: I think as a technical matter, 

Justice Kennedy, that's correct. But I don't think 

that's the natural way to read the statute, and when the 

Congress imposed that abuse of discretion standard it 

assumed that the decisions that were being -- that were 

subject to review involved the exercise of a discretion.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't, I don't even think 

it's technically correct. How is it an abuse of 

discretion? He has no discretion. He must do it. How 

could you say he has abused his discretion? What

discretion?

 MR. MARCUS: Well I think some cases --

there is some case law that has said that when there is 

an error of law committed by a lower court that can 

constitute an abuse of discretion. But in our view 

again it's not the natural reading of the standard that 

Congress put in. And also, if you look at the 

legislative history, Justice Kennedy, you'll see that 

Congress was focused on the absence of a judicial remedy 

with respect to determinations by the Secretary that 

involved an exercise in discretion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But what the cases 

said prior to 6404(h) when they asked for interest 

abatement was not that we don't have jurisdiction to 

consider that claim. They would just say there's no 

standard to apply, so it's committed to agency 

discretion by law. Then all of a sudden 6404(h) comes 

along and gives you a standard, so that removes that 

objection. What's wrong with that?

 MR. MARCUS: I think that's -- with respect, 

I think the Fifth Circuit's reasoning is too clever by 

half. The Fifth Circuit basically extracted one piece 

of Section 6404(h)'s integrated whole and held that 

there now is a refund cause of action that's not subject 

to the specific restrictions.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's because 

of the way that Congress enacted the language. It 

doesn't say that the tax court and only the tax court 

shall have jurisdiction. It says the tax court shall 

have jurisdiction. That is a, in many respects a 

preferred forum and they're saying you can bring it 

there as well, but it doesn't take away the jurisdiction 

that the prior courts had recognized.

 MR. MARCUS: Well, I think you need to look 

at what the state of the law was when Congress enacted 

this provision and think about what Congress would have 

wanted to do. If Congress would have wanted to reverse 

those decisions that had said there's no cause, no 

refund cause of action for interest abatement, they 

could have easily referenced the refund statute and said 

there is a refund action available. They also could 

have specified that the Court of Federal Claims or the 

district courts can exercise jurisdiction over interest 

abatement issues.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Don't you think it's 

kind of strange, though, if you have the interest 

abatement is available only for a particular category of 

taxpayer and not others?

 MR. MARCUS: No.

worth of two million and one dollar you can't get any 

interest abatement, but if it's $2 million you can.

 MR. MARCUS: I don't think, I don't think 

it's anomalous. I think if you consider the concept of 

interest under the tax code, the way it works under the 

tax code is interest accrues on an unpaid tax liability 

from the time the tax is due until the time the tax is 

paid. So the amount of underpayment is the amount of 

taxpayer is borrowing from the Government. The interest 

that accrues on that underpayment is not a penalty; it's 

just a charge basically for the time value of money.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, but you abate 

it in some cases, but you don't abate it in the others.

 MR. MARCUS: Right. But I think, I think 

the idea was that Congress was concerned that some 

taxpayers, taxpayers that fall within the net worth 

limitations, might be in positions where they are less 

positioned to pay the full tax liability up front.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's what I 

thought, too. But then your friend explained that in 

the initial bill is where the interest is contained in a 

lot of these cases and in this case in particular. So 

it's not as if you have the opportunity to pay it in 

advance to stop the accrual of interest. Just you get 

the bill and you find out, you know, you owe a 1,000

dollars and 300 of it is interest.

 MR. MARCUS: I don't think that's correct, 

Your Honor. The way this is -- the interest that's 

abatable is, a taxpayer is in full control of whether 

that interest runs or not. If the taxpayer pays his 

full tax liability on time, interest doesn't accrue, so 

there's no interest to abate.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But he doesn't even know 

what his tax liability is, especially in a partnership 

situation.

 MR. MARCUS: Well, the taxpayer --

JUSTICE SCALIA : He makes the 

partnership calculation, it goes to the IRS, and then 

they figure out what the tax is. And meanwhile, you 

know, the interest is running.

 MR. MARCUS: Well, Justice Scalia, first of 

all, the taxpayer is in the best position to know what 

the tax liability is. If a taxpayer is going to make 

certain investments, they should understand what the tax 

consequences are.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: This is quite a different 

argument. You're saying, you know, he should have paid 

the full tax in the first place, not he could have paid 

the interest that he knew was accruing.

 MR. MARCUS: Right. But he could have

prevented that, the abatable interest, from accruing. 

This abatable interest doesn't accrue until the taxpayer 

receives notice from the IRS that there is a problem 

with the return. So the -- in other words, that first 

period from the time the underpayment is made until the 

IRS notifies the taxpayer, that, that interest is not 

subject to abatement. That automatically accrues and 

there is no remedy. Congress has created no remedy for 

that period, and there's just a period, there's a 

provision in section --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I didn't 

understand that. Say that again? There's no abatement 

for the interest that accrues until you're notified of 

what the --

MR. MARCUS: Until you're notified, until 

the IRS notifies you that they are looking further at 

your return. They might not at that point tell you 

precisely how much you owe, but you're on notice that 

the IRS is looking into your return further and that you 

can at that point make a payment or put down a deposit 

that doesn't compromise your ability as a taxpayer to go 

into the tax court, but it does stop the accrual of 

abatable interest.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you don't know how much 

to pay, do you? I mean, when they send you the notice

they don't send a notice that says, we're looking into 

this and we think you're going to end up owing $5,000, 

do they? They don't give you a figure.

 MR. MARCUS: Again, they don't necessarily 

tell you exactly how much you owe, but it's the 

taxpayers' --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Do they name a figure at 

all --

MR. MARCUS: They sometimes do.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- when they give you the 

initial notice?

 MR. MARCUS: They sometimes do, and then at 

18 months, at 18 months under subsection (g), under 18 

months under a provision that was acted in 1998, the IRS 

has to at 18 months tell you how much you owe; 

otherwise, the interest cannot continue to accrue after 

that 18-month period. But you should -- but it is the 

taxpayer's responsibility to know what their tax 

liability is.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's true. That's true. 

But you can make that argument. That argument, if you 

accepted it, would be an argument for having no 

amendment to subsection (h) at all.

 MR. MARCUS: Right, but that's the idea.

the Secretary to abate, and then Congress gave the 

Secretary that authority as a matter of grace in 1986, 

to extend this relief to forgive the accrual of 

interest. I mean, after this is money --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And the question is, why is 

the grace confined to some taxpayers and not to others?

 MR. MARCUS: The short answer is because 

Congress has said that, said that, and the Congress 

decided to impose the net worth limitation.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They've said it if we 

accept your view of the exclusivity of the amendment to 

(h).

 MR. MARCUS: Right. And typically when 

Congress imposes restrictions on a remedy this Court 

reads that, reads that as an intentional --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah, but is there any 

other instance in the law? I suppose there probably is, 

but what surprised me about that is this: Imagine we 

have two citizens and they are identical in every 

respect in terms of their claim, they each believe the 

government owes them $50,000. They each have 

identically strong claims. And Congress passes a law 

and says one of you can come into court and the other 

can't. Now suppose it said the poor person can't come 

into court. Do you think there wouldn't be a

constitutional problem there? Remember, they have the 

same claim for the same amount, with the same precise 

strength of their argument. But we say rich people can 

go in, and we'd say why did you do that? We say poor 

people don't have as much stake in society. They don't 

have -- now suppose you heard such an argument. How 

long would it take you to feel there's a constitutional 

problem?

 MR. MARCUS: Well, I think there has to be a 

rational basis for --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. No. No. The rational 

basis is that the poor person doesn't have the stake in 

society that a rich one does.

 MR. MARCUS: Well, I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It's worthless. Okay. Now 

I guess, if you can't keep the poor person out for such 

a reason then you can't keep the rich person out for 

that reason. So you tell me what the rationale is in 

keeping the rich person out any more than the poor 

person. They have the same claim, same amount, same 

cause. The cause, by the way, was that some bureaucrat 

in the IRS forgot to send a notice so nobody knew what 

was happening. That was the cause. And the reason it 

didn't get abated is because a different bureaucrat got 

mixed up, okay? Same claims.

MR. MARCUS: Keep in mind, this is -- what 

you're talking about is, this is interest that's running 

on money that the taxpayer is borrowing from the 

Government. This is money that the Government is 

legally entitled to as of the date it was originally 

due.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yeah.

 MR. MARCUS: And so this is money that the 

taxpayer is borrowing. A large net, high net worth 

taxpayer can invest that money elsewhere and may well 

even make out even better.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But at the end of the day, 

the claim happens to be interest worth $5,000. The IRS 

abused its discretion under the statute in failing to 

write a check for $5,000 to both. What we do is we 

allow one of them to bring a lawsuit to get the 5,000, 

and we say to the other one, you can't bring the lawsuit 

to get the 5,000.

 Now my question is, what's the basis for 

that distinction?

 MR. MARCUS: And the rational basis is that 

Congress believed that taxpayers of a high net worth, 

there would be no hardship, but -- in them not having a 

cause of action.

hardship?

 MR. MARCUS: Because they can use the money, 

invest the money.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And so can a poor person.

 MR. MARCUS: Well, but they're not as well 

positioned as the wealthy taxpayer, so --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The next thing you know, 

they will enact a progressive income tax.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: By the way, this has 

nothing to do with the progressive income tax. What I 

have not seen anywhere is the use of wealth, totally 

different from the dollar value of a claim, to shut the 

courthouse door. I'm just saying, is there such a case 

anywhere, and if there is no such case, then I'd say I 

wonder about this assumption. The assumption that the 

reason that you cannot keep the courthouse door open to 

everyone is because what?

 MR. MARCUS: Well, first of all, there are 

other examples. There's --

JUSTICE BREYER: What.

 MR. MARCUS: This is derived from, 

ultimately derived from the Equal Access to Justice Act, 

there are attorneys' fees provisions, but also 

assistance to taxpayers, and those net worth limitations

JUSTICE BREYER: We know, attorneys' fees 

you give to poor people more than to rich people. That 

makes sense. That has nothing to do with having a 

formal rule saying you cannot enter the courthouse.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there a you cannot enter 

the courthouse provision here, or is it -- as I 

understand your case, it is that it remains 

discretionary with the Secretary with respect to people 

who have more money, but it is not discretionary with 

respect to people who have less money.

 MR. MARCUS: That's correct.


 JUSTICE BREYER: I don't understand.


 JUSTICE SCALIA: So one has a cause of


action and the other doesn't have a cause of action. 

And the difference you're making between the two is 

you're permitting the Secretary to waive the interest 

with respect to the rich. You're requiring him to do it 

with respect to the poor. Isn't that the difference?

 MR. MARCUS: That's correct. There is an 

administrative claim that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Wait. That might be the 

answer.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The poor do not have the 

incentive or even the ability to defer paying a tax,

where the people that have large bank accounts may, and 

investments, may well profit by just paying the interest 

to the Government.

 MR. MARCUS: That's exactly right. And 

Justice Breyer, if you want, if you --

JUSTICE BREYER: Wait. Wait. There are two 

separate things. I want to understand this. In other 

words, the Secretary does not have the power to abate 

the interest in respect to the rich person?

 MR. MARCUS: No. He does have the 

authority.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Oh.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's permissive, not 

mandatory.

 MR. MARCUS: Yeah, the Secretary has the 

authority to waive interest.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But he doesn't have --

JUSTICE BREYER: He can do it -- in the 

first case with the rich person, he can abuse his 

discretion.

 MR. MARCUS: With respect to taxpayers who 

meet the net worth limitations.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In other words, in the one 

case Congress has passed a law saying with a poor person 

you cannot abuse your discretion, but with a rich person

you can abuse your discretion. That's what the 

underlying substantive statute says.

 MR. MARCUS: And there's another --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait a minute. They are 

not really saying that. They're saying it's totally 

within your discretion. You can't possibly abuse your 

discretion when you have total discretion. They're just 

saying, you know, do it if you want to do it.

 MR. MARCUS: That's right. It's a matter of 

administrative grace for the Federal taxpayers who 

are --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No. The standard of 

discretion is the same for the poor and the rich, isn't 

it? The only difference is that the poor can get into 

court and the rich cannot.

 MR. MARCUS: They have an enforceable right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So it's a question of 

remedy, not standing.

 MR. MARCUS: Right. There's a judicial 

remedy in one case and only an administrative remedy in 

the other.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is that the poverty line?

in the tax -- I'm sorry, Justice Alito.

million the poverty line now?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MARCUS: Not that I'm aware of.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So what is -- so what's the 

rationale? This isn't treating the rich and the poor 

differently, is it?

 MR. MARCUS: It's treating exceedingly high 

net worth individuals and corporations differently from 

everyone else.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Someone with a net worth of 

$1.5 million couldn't invest the money in the interim?

 MR. MARCUS: They could. Congress chose to 

draw the line where it used this provision that was 

already in place under the Equal Access to Justice Act. 

It referred to that provision --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: This was for purposes of 

attorneys' fees?

 MR. MARCUS: Right, the provision that 

applies to attorneys' fees. Congress has also imposed 

this provision in a burden shifting provision in the tax 

code, Section 7491. If the Court wants to get a better 

idea of what Congress's concern for what it called the 

average taxpayer, or the smaller taxpayers, it can look 

at the legislative history. There was a hearing in 

March of 1995 that's cited on page 98 of the

supplemental appendix to the cert petition, and that was 

the Court of Federal Claims decision. It's footnote 19. 

It refers to a hearing in March 1995. And if you read 

through that, you can see where that concern for the --

for average taxpayers and lower net worth taxpayers came 

from.

 Nothing in Section 6404(h) gives rise to an 

inference that Congress intended to establish additional 

remedies in the district court and Court of Federal 

Claims. To the contrary, this Court has consistently 

applied the rule that when Congress creates a specific 

remedy, it intends that remedy to be exclusive. That 

rule is fully applicable here. Otherwise, the specific 

restrictions Congress imposed on the remedy could be 

defeated by bringing the claim in a different forum.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Wouldn't it have been 

simpler if Congress just said the tax court shall have 

exclusive jurisdiction, instead of just saying 

jurisdiction?

 MR. MARCUS: That might have made it 

simpler, Justice Ginsburg, but it accomplished the same 

result by imposing the specific restrictions that it 

did. And again, it would have -- there's another --

there are two other provisions in the tax code where 

Congress -- where the tax court effectively has -- one

of the provisions where the tax court has exclusive 

jurisdiction under Section 6330(d), where also it 

doesn't specify that -- the Congress didn't specify the 

tax court has exclusive jurisdiction but it does. And 

there's another case where there's an administrative 

determination, it doesn't go to the underlying 

substantive tax liability.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The difference --

the difference is that the district court, the claims 

court already has jurisdiction for pay and sue claims, 

if you pay the IRS you can sue to get a refund. And so 

this isn't as if we're looking at something that says 

the tax court has jurisdiction and trying to use that as 

a wedge to get other jurisdiction. There's already a 

grant of jurisdiction. The problem was, there was no 

standard of review for these may abate claims, and all 

of a sudden we find in this provision there is a 

standard of review, it's abuse of discretion, and that 

fills the void. Why can't they just use that?

 MR. MARCUS: Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice, 

I don't think it was just a matter of not being a 

standard of review. I think it was a matter of just 

being, of intent by Congress to have this just be a 

matter of administrative grace. And again, if you 

contrast the language of the different --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought what 

you had argued before when people would try to seek this 

release was that there's no standard of review to hold 

the Secretary's exercise of discretion up against.

 MR. MARCUS: I think that was one of the 

reasons that the Government cited, but I think there was 

others as well.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But one thing you 

never said was that there was no jurisdiction, because 

there is jurisdiction in the district court. If you've 

paid money to the IRS and you want it back, you can 

bring a refund action.

 MR. MARCUS: If you have a legal entitlement 

to it, and the point is you didn't have a legal 

entitlement to it before. That's what the courts held, 

and Congress responded to that, not by saying you do 

have a legally entitlement to this through a refund 

action, which they easily could have said if they wanted 

to reject those prior decisions, but instead they 

created a limited remedy in the tax court. I don't see 

how you can read that limited remedy in the tax court to 

give rise to a broader remedy that doesn't have those 

restrictions that Congress imposed on the tax court 

remedy.

 So it should be -- I think 6404(h) should be

read as an integrated whole and you can't just extract 

one piece and then bring that over, as the Fifth Circuit 

said, to apply to a refund action. I don't think that's 

the proper way to interpret the.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I now think maybe I don't 

agree on this point that there are different standards, 

because it does say in this abuse of discretion. And 

indeed that's a normal administrative standard, and so 

as you read this you would think that the IRS does not 

have any legal power substantively to abuse its 

discretion in refusing to bring an abasement in refusing 

to bring an abatement -- excuse me, to abate the 

interest. So far do you agree?

 MR. MARCUS: I'm sorry, Justice Breyer? 

That Congress --

JUSTICE BREYER: Once they make clear that 

the standard is abuse of discretion, it only makes clear 

what's there in the law anyway, that administrative 

authorities do not have the authority to abuse their 

discretion. Now, sometimes we don't review that in the 

courts. That doesn't make it legal. It just means you 

can't catch them out in court.

 MR. MARCUS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So there's a standard that 

applies to everybody. Then all that this does, to go

back to it is it closes the courthouse door. Now I want 

to know what your rationale was for doing that? It had 

nothing to do with the standards that applied. It has 

to have something to do with why one class of people by 

wealth are kept out of court. I think if it were the 

other way around it wouldn't last for three seconds, and 

the only reason maybe I don't think about it as hard 

this way because I think, well, privilege is involved, 

etcetera. But when you force me to think about it, I 

want to know what the reason so.

 MR. MARCUS: Well, I don't think it's right 

to characterize it as the closing of the courthouse 

door. Congress opened the courthouse door in a limited 

fashioning in 1996. That's what happened. There was no 

courthouse door opened in --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'll accept that 

characterization. Now you give me the reason why we've 

opened the courthouse door to individuals who are alike 

in every respect but for their net worth? Now give me 

that, the same reason? I always want to know what the 

specific reason is, the specific rationale and. I'm not 

saying there isn't one. I just want to know what it is.

 MR. MARCUS: Justice Breyer, I don't know if 

I can give you a better one than I gave before. But 

it's that high net worth taxpayers are better positioned

to pay their full tax liability up front and to handle 

the accumulation of interest in the event that there is 

some delay in the processing of their return.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: They're exactly alike but 

for their ability to earn interest in different ways.

 MR. MARCUS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And I would not concede, as 

you seem to have, that the consequence of (h) is simply 

to open the door. I think the category of decisions 

that are committed to agency discretion by law within 

the meaning of the APA are agency decisions as to which 

the term "abuse of discretion" makes no sense. There's 

no such thing. It is totally committed to agency 

discretion. It's only other decisions that are not 

committed to agency discretion by law where you -- where 

the discretion can be abused. If you look at it that 

way, it isn't a matter of closing the door to one 

category and opening it to another; it's a matter of 

different substantive laws applying to the two, to the 

two classes. Anyway, I choose to look at it that way. 

You can talk --

MR. MARCUS: That's a fine way of looking at 

it, Justice Scalia. The other, the other anomaly the 

Fifth Circuit identified was the taxpayer, the taxpayer 

seeking a refund having to split off his claims. This

too is not a significant anomaly. The vast majority of 

taxpayers seek redetermination of their tax liability in 

the tax court and those taxpayers must split their 

claims because the interest abatement claim doesn't 

ripen until the taxpayer's underlying liability has been 

assessed. Moreover, the interest abatement question is 

distinct from the taxpayer's underlying liability.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can they bring it as 

additional claim after they get the final determination? 

They start a whole separate action for interest 

abatement?

 MR. MARCUS: That's -- if they, if they, if 

they got relief on their refund claim, if they prevail 

on their refund claim there would be no need to do that. 

The interest would automatically abate. But if they 

were unsuccessful they could still pursue an interest 

abatement on the grounds that the IRS committed an error 

in delay in performing a material act.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is it part of the 

same proceeding or is it a separate proceeding?

 MR. MARCUS: Well, it would be, it would be 

a proceeding that would follow the proceeding on the 

underlying liability.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You're making the 

claim that it's no big deal that you have to go to the

district court to get your refund and then go to the tax 

court to get the interest abatement, which does seem 

like a big deal to me. And you say, well, in the tax 

court you have to do it separately, too.

 MR. MARCUS: It's not as inconvenient --

well, it, it may be inconvenient but it's a necessary 

consequence of the exclusive review scheme the Congress 

set up. And there is no reason -- to take that policy 

concern and have that trump the statutory language and 

the regime that Congress clearly established.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And there is no linkage 

between the two, with, it's one thing to split a claim 

when they have common elements, but the interest 

abatement has nothing to do with the substantive 

underlying -- substantive liability?

 MR. MARCUS: That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. It involves questions about administrative 

problems that might arise during the processing of the 

taxpayer's case. A ministerial act, the failure to 

transfer a file when a taxpayer moves from one 

jurisdiction to another, or after, or notice of 

deficiency if the agent just delays in issuing the 

notice because he forgot about it and it just sat on his 

desk for a couple of days. Those are the kinds of 

issues that, that come up in interest abatement

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. REDDING,

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. REDDING: If I may, there are a couple 

of brief points I would like to make. In the 

legislative history of the 6404(h) it concludes with the 

statement that no inference should be made from that 

legislation as to other courts' jurisdiction. I think 

that should be taken very seriously. As to the claims 

court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Who said that?

 MR. REDDING: That's in a House committee 

report, Your Honor. As to claim splitting, it is 

actually a horrendous problem when you're talking 

especially about partnership-related cases. I will note 

that there are several hundred cases below waiting the 

outcome of this case. As in the Cramer and Weiner 

opinions that came out of the Fifth Circuit, the Court 

can note that there are claims for interest abatement,

abatement not under 6404, but that interest was 

overcharged by applying the penalty rate of interest. 

There is a refund claim for the penalty portion of the 

interest.

 There is also a refund claim that the tax 

was assessed outside the statute of limitations; that's 

clearly a refund claim. None of those claims would be 

encompassed under 6404(h). These taxpayers would have 

had to have completely split their claims, asked for an 

interest abatement in the tax court for abuse of 

discretion on 6404(e)(1).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the point that 

Mr. Marcus just made, that the issue is discrete on 

interest abatement, and it involves mishandling within 

the Internal Revenue processing, and it's not like other 

questions that have to do with the -- with the 

intricacies of the Internal Revenue Code --

MR. REDDING: That's only relatively true to 

6404(e)(1), Your Honor. But I will note that under 

6404(a), where cases are now coming out of the tax court 

for the first time, because it now has jurisdiction 

under (h), it provides authority for the Commissioner to 

abate interest where the IRS has erroneously or 

illegally assessed the tax liability after the statute 

of limitations runs or whether it's simply an erroneous

assessment. Those claims have nothing to do with 

discretion, and they are not really just ancillary to 

the tax liability; they arise out of the substantive 

challenge to the liability itself. The Woodrall case 

that has come out, which is the, I think is the first of 

the 6404(a) cases, was an assertion that the 

interest had been charged after the tax had been paid. 

Now that's not a discretionary abatement; that's an 

illegal assessment of interest and that's a 6404(h) 

claim now.

 Previously it would have been strictly a 

refund claim under 16 -- under 1346.

 I would also note that in terms of the being 

able to pay it to cut off the interest accrual, that in 

these cases, these cases that are before the Court, the 

F quality -- the document the Government first sent out 

proposing adjustments to the partnership level, if you 

had computed the liability based on what the 

Government's position was, the ultimate tax liability 

including interest to any point in time would have been 

at least three times the amount that results from the 

tax court decision.

 It's just ludicrous to say that the taxpayer 

should be expected to take whatever the Government's 

proposed adjustments are, compute what his maximum

liability may be, and pay it in advance or post a bond 

in advance in order to cut off the interest accrual. 

That argument just doesn't -- in my mind does not fly, 

Your Honor.

 This, this Court in Bob Jones University did 

address the pay and sue versus prepayment jurisdiction 

issue in terms of constitutionality and due process. 

And, and basically said that as long as there is a pay 

and sue remedy available, the taxpayer has no due 

process rights to a prepayment remedy, but that the 

Court might have come down differently had there been no 

remedy available in terms of pay and sue.

 I would also note that both the tax court, 

the district courts, the Court of Federal Claims and the 

appellate courts have long reviewed other discretionary 

acts within the tax code by the Commissioner where no 

standard is set forth on an abuse of discretion 

standard, such as the authorization of the Commissioner 

to abate certain penalties where the taxpayer has sought 

an independent appraisal on the overvaluation penalty 

under 6659. Those cases have been reviewed for years by 

the tax court and by the district courts in refund cases 

on an abuse of discretion standard. It is the Federal 

common law standard for reviewing an abuse of 

discretion.
