CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Lopez versus Gonzales and 

Toledo-Flores versus United States. 

Mr. Long. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR. 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER LOPEZ 

MR. LONG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 

the Court: 

A drug-trafficking crime is defined in 18 U.S. 

Code Section 924(c) as any felony punishable under the 

Controlled Substances Act or two other Federal statutes. 

"Punishable" is a key term. If that word is omitted, the 

remaining phrase, "any felony under the Controlled 

Substances Act," clearly refers to felony violations of 

the Controlled Substances Act. The parties agree that 

"punishable" means "subject to criminal sanctions." So, a 

"drug-trafficking crime," under 924(c), is conduct that is 

subject to being punished under the Controlled Substances 

Act.

 State felonies are not, themselves, punishable 

under the Controlled Substances Act. It is not a Federal 

crime to violate State law. The defendant's conduct may 

be punishable under both Federal and State law, but a

State felony is not a felony punishable under the 

Controlled Substances Act. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do you agree that if 

there were a State conviction for an offense that would 

have been punishable under the Federal law, their both 

being felonies, that enhancement can apply, in that 

instance, and that that does meet the definition? 

MR. LONG: Yes, Justice Kennedy. Our position 

is, if the conduct would violate a felony provision of the 

Controlled Substances Act or one of the other two Federal 

statutes, it then is a drug-trafficking crime under 18 

U.S. Code Section 924(c), and, therefore, it is an 

aggravated felony.

 But there are three additional textual 

indications, in addition to simply the "felony punishable" 

language, that misdemeanor offenses under the Controlled 

Substances Act are not drug-trafficking crimes under 

Section 924(c). The first one is, there are other 

provisions of Section 924 -- (e), (g), and (k) -- where 

Congress actually used very similar language. It referred 

to conduct punishable under the Controlled Substances Act 

or the two other statutes, or offenses under the 

Controlled Substances Act or the two other Federal 

statutes. But then, it added an express reference to 

State offenses, so --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where --

MR. LONG: -- the implication is that when 

Congress meant to include State offenses, it said so. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where are those sections?

 MR. LONG: The -- you can find them; they're in 

the appendix to Lopez's blue brief, Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. LONG: -- and the provisions on (e), (g), 

and (k) -- 924 begins on page 3A of the appendix, and (e) 

begins on 5A, and you can pick up -- (g) is on 6A, (k) is 

on 7A. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What are the sections -- (b)? 

MR. LONG: They're subsections (e), (g), and 

(k). 

JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that doesn't carry 

too much weight, though, because the provision that -- I'm 

looking at (g)(3), "violates any State law relating to any 

controlled substance," can be broader than what's 

punishable under the Federal Controlled Substances --

MR. LONG: It --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- Act. 

MR. LONG: It is a bit broader, Mr. Chief 

Justice, but if you look at all of these provisions, the 

implication is clearly that Congress was referring to

State law when it meant to include State law. I mean, the 

-- if you looked at (e), for example, there it's a 

parallel construction; it's not broader. I think perhaps 

the government would say, "Well, we're talking about 

offenses." That's a little different from a felony, but 

"offenses" is actually a broader term. 

I'll mention an additional statute, which was 

not in the appendix -- 18 U.S. Code Section 3559(c)(2)(H). 

This provision -- it's a similar provision; it defines a 

"serious drug offense" as an offense that is punishable 

under the specific sections of the Controlled Substances 

Act, or an offense under State law that, had the offense 

been prosecuted in a court of the United States, would 

have been punishable under the CSA.

 An additional textual indication is, it's agreed 

-- and this Court has already said, in Gonzales against 

the United States, that a drug-trafficking crime under 

924(c), under the criminal statute, must be a Federal 

crime. 924(c)(1)(A) refers to a crime that may be 

prosecuted in a court of the United States, and that 

clearly refers to a Federal crime. The definition of 

drug-trafficking crime, by its term, says it is for 

purposes of 924(c), so there is no reason why Congress 

would have wanted to include State felonies in a 

definition that applies to a Federal criminal provision

that all concede applies only to Federal predicate 

offenses. And --

JUSTICE ALITO: In --

MR. LONG: -- the Government's interpretation 

would significantly broaden Section 924(c) to include 

Federal misdemeanors. 

JUSTICE ALITO: In 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(B), 

what, in your view, does the first phrase, "illicit 

trafficking in a controlled substance," add to the 

reference to a drug-trafficking crime --

MR. LONG: Justice --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- as defined by 924(c)? 

MR. LONG: Justice Alito, in our view, "illicit 

trafficking" means any offense that has a trafficking 

element -- that is, distribution, possession with intent 

to distribute, manufacture --

JUSTICE ALITO: But are there any trafficking 

offenses that would not fall within 924(c) if you define a 

"trafficking offense" that way? 

MR. LONG: Yes. They're -- most offenses under 

the Controlled Substances Act are trafficking offenses. 

There are a few that are simple possession. There is a 

date-rape drug that I will not try to pronounce, but it's 

listed in 21 U.S.C. Section --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, no, there --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- are possessory -- there are 

"mere possession" offenses that are outlawed by 924(c), 

but is it not the case that any -- if you interpret 

"trafficking" to mean trafficking in the way the word 

would be used in ordinary speech -- that any State 

trafficking offense you can think of would have a 

corresponding felony violation under the Controlled 

Substances Act, so that if you read the statute that way, 

the initial phrase is superfluous?

 MR. LONG: I believe the Government has a 

footnote in their brief where they suggest there are some 

State trafficking offenses that actually do not have a 

parallel in Federal law. Soliciting, I think, may be one 

of them. So, I think there are, in fact, some. And our 

position, of course, is that by adding illicit trafficking 

-- any trafficking offense, State or Federal, whether or 

not it is punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, 

is an aggravated felony. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Let me ask the same question a 

different way. If -- since 924(c) includes some "mere 

possession" offenses, and illicit trafficking in a 

controlled substance includes all violations of 924(c), 

doesn't that show that the way Congress used "illicit 

trafficking in a controlled substance" is not in the sense

in which the term is used in ordinary speech, but's much 

broader, so that it can include "mere possession" 

offenses? 

MR. LONG: The -- Justice Alito, there is an 

argument -- it's developed in the brief of the American 

Bar Association -- that, because illicit trafficking is 

the general category, that all the aggravated felonies in 

this category should have a trafficking component; and, 

therefore, the felonies punishable under the Controlled 

Substances Act that are "simple possession" offenses 

should not, in fact, be included. That is not an argument 

that we have pressed in our brief. We read the phrase to 

say "illicit trafficking, including any felony punishable 

under the Controlled Substances Act." So, I would agree 

with you, to the extent that if it is a felony punishable 

under the Controlled Substances Act, Congress has said, by 

definition, that it is included in the category of illicit 

trafficking. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But that's ambiguous. That's 

perfectly ambiguous. Because, the case of your client, it 

is a felony, and it is punishable under the Controlled 

Substances Act. 

MR. LONG: Well, Justice Breyer, it is a 

misdemeanor under --

that's the Government's argument -- they say "any felony

don't mean, necessarily, any felony punishable as a felony 

under the Controlled Substances Act. 

MR. LONG: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: It might mean anything that is 

a --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- felony, and --

MR. LONG: But --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- it is also punishable; in 

which case, you lose. But, in the first case, you win.

JUSTICE BREYER: So, what am I supposed to look 

to, to decide which is --

MR. LONG: Well, you could look to the case of 

Jerome against United States, which is -- which was a 

unanimous decision of this Court -- in which the Court 

held that the -- just the phrase "any felony" --

JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh.

 MR. LONG: -- in the Federal bankruptcy statute 

should be interpreted to mean any Federal felony, so --

punishable as a felony under South Dakota law, and it is 

also punishable as a felony under Federal law, under 801,

conviction under Federal or State law. It's simply a

question of whether the conduct is punishable, capable of

it's a State felony --

MR. LONG: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it --

MR. LONG: Precisely. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- if this is an 

ambiguous statute, do you -- what mileage do you get from 

Barrett? There is certainly an argument that what was --

Congress was trying to do was to codify that practice of 

saying, "If there is analogous felony -- if there is 

analogous crime under State law, that should be included."

And that made good sense. 

MR. LONG: Yes. If it's ambiguous, and you look 

to the legislative history, I think we get considerable 

mileage from Barrett. The Congress was pretty clear that 

what it was doing was codifying Barrett. The Barrett 

approach, which was then followed by the BIA for more than 

a decade, was that they would count State drug crimes, but 

only if they were felonies under the Federal statutes, 

under the Controlled Substances Act. So, I think we get 

considerable mileage out of that. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You've --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- about the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- answered Justice Breyer by 

citing the Jerome case. After Jerome, we decided United 

States vs. Gonzales, having to do with the consecutive or 

concurrent sentencing terms. And it -- are those two 

cases in some tension? Gonzales didn't mention Jerome. 

And I noticed that none of the briefs mentioned it either. 

Is there some tension in the cases? And, if so, is this a 

case where, when we write an opinion, whatever the 

outcome, we should talk about that? And, if that's so, 

what should we say? 

MR. LONG: I don't see any tension. Gonzales 

was just about consecutive versus concurrent sentences

under State versus Federal law. I mean, the Court has 

applied that principle --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it does --

MR. LONG: For example, in Taylor --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it does seem to limit the 

broad statement in Jerome, without mentioning Jerome. 

MR. LONG: Well, but -- I mean, with respect, 

Justice Kennedy, I don't see how it limits it. And there 

have been other cases -- Taylor is an example -- where the 

Court adopted a single definition of "burglary" for 

purposes of 924(e). That applies the Jerome principle. I 

mean, it's a principle that has been applied in a number 

of this Court's cases. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But has it ever been 

applied in a -- to a statute that specifically says that 

the term "aggravated felony" applies to an offense 

described in this paragraph, whether in violation of 

Federal or State law? 

MR. LONG: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That would seem to me to 

be a very express legislative repudiation of the Jerome --

MR. LONG: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- principle. 

MR. LONG: -- when we get to that language, Mr. 

Chief Justice -- and I do think it helps the analysis to

first decide, What is the definition of a "drug-

trafficking crime" under 924(c), the criminal statute? 

Once you've decided that -- now, when you move back to the 

INA, there is this language. The term "aggravated felony" 

applies to an offense described in 101(a)(43), whether in 

violation of Federal or State law, or the law of a foreign 

country. Now, we think that's pretty straightforward. It 

has to be an offense described. So, the simple example is 

money laundering. It -- the offense described in 18 U.S. 

Code Section 1956, "money laundering," is an aggravated 

felony. So, a violation of State law or of foreign law 

can be an aggravated felony, but only if it is the offense 

described in 1956. If States or a foreign government has 

a broader definition of "money laundering," that can't 

count, because it's not the offense described. And when 

you turn to a drug-trafficking crime, the way that offense 

is described in 101(A)(43) is -- Congress picked up, in 

its entirety and without any modification, the definition 

of "drug-trafficking crime" in 924(c), a felony punishable 

under the Controlled Substances Act.

 So, if you agree that, in the criminal statute, 

that means a felony violation of the Controlled Substances 

Act, the offense described is the felonies in the 

Controlled Substances Act, not the felonies in the 

misdemeanors. And State -- if State law wants to call a

-- something that's a misdemeanor under Federal law a 

felony, they can do that, but they can't expand the 

offense described. The offense described, the way 

Congress did that, is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But are you saying it would 

also include State trafficking offense, because it's 

described in the word "trafficking"?

 MR. LONG: Yes. I'm focusing on the definition 

of "drug-trafficking crime." It -- also, there's the 

illicit trafficking piece of this. And, I should add, any 

State offense that is illicit trafficking is going to be 

an aggravated felony. We recognize that.

 If there are no further questions, I'd like to 

reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY CROOKS 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER TOLEDO-FLORES 

MR. CROOKS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I would first like to address the Government's 

contention that Mr. Toledo-Flores's appeal is moot. His 

appeal of his sentence is not moot, primarily because he 

is still subject to the sentence that is the subject of 

that appeal. Even though Mr. Toledo-Flores was released

from prison on April 21st of this year, and deported to 

Mexico, he's still subject to the supervised-release 

portion of his sentence, because supervised release is not 

automatically extinguished by deportation. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But there's no 

supervised release of people outside the United States. 

MR. CROOKS: There's no supervision of people 

outside the United States, Mr. Chief Justice, but he is 

still subject to the jurisdiction of the District Court, 

and still subject to the conditions of supervised release 

that are not dependent upon supervision. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, like what? 

MR. CROOKS: Well, for example, he shall not 

excessively use alcohol, he shall not associate with 

persons who --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's going to happen 

to him if he does that? 

MR. CROOKS: If the District Court learns about 

it he could be violated -- he could be extradited back 

from Mexico, and he could face up to a year more in 

prison. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Has anything like that 

ever happened before with people subject to supervised 

release who are then deported? It would be the first 

time, if the District Court did that, right?

MR. CROOKS: There have been instances in the 

case law where people on supervised release have been 

extradited back from foreign countries based on violations 

of their supervised release. But the point is, under the 

statutory scheme, Mr. Toledo-Flores is still subject to 

the District Court's jurisdiction. The District Court 

retains jurisdiction to modify his supervised release, to 

change the conditions, or to cut the supervised release. 

If the District Court learns of a violation and a 

violation warrant is filed within the supervised-release 

period then the supervised-release period is effectively 

tolled and the District Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that --

MR. CROOKS: -- retains --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that period has how many 

months to run?

 MR. CROOKS: Until April 20th of next year, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you -- you said you rely 

primarily on that argument -- do you have another 

argument? 

MR. CROOKS: Yes, we do, Your Honor. After 

April 20th, of course, in accordance with this Court's 

decisions in Spencer v. Kemna and Lane v. Williams, the 

Court needs to look for a collateral consequence of the

then-expired sentence. And, in this case, we point to the 

possibility that a retrospective reduction in the term of 

imprisonment -- which, of course, will not give excess 

prison time back to Mr. Toledo-Flores -- but even to 

reduce the number of the sentence, on paper, could be a 

favorable factor for him to get a waiver of 

inadmissibility, should he ever want to get a nonimmigrant 

visa in the future to come visit his U.S.-citizen 

children. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: We have a case involving 

standing which says that -- you know, the doctrine of 

standing is more than a -- an exercise in the -- in the 

conceivable. And this seems to me an exercise in the 

conceivable. Nobody thinks your client is really, you 

know, abstaining from tequila down in Mexico because he's 

on supervised release in the United States, or is going --

is going to apply -- having been deported from the country 

for criminal offenses, is going to apply to come back in 

the -- these are ingenious exercises in the conceivable. 

This is just not the real world. 

MR. CROOKS: Well, my answer to that, Justice 

Scalia, is that this Court has never said that an appeal 

of a sentence may become moot before that sentence is 

expired. And in cases like Lane v. Williams and Spencer 

v. Kemna, the sentences were completely expired, and,

therefore, the Court had to look for collateral 

consequences of the now-expired sentence. Here, in 

consequence -- in contrast, Mr. Toledo-Flores is still 

under the sentence, which is a direct consequence --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That depends on whether you 

consider the sentence to be effectively expired once he 

leaves the country, if the sentence is one of supervised 

release, which is impossible once he leaves the country. 

Supervision being impossible, supervised release is not a 

realistic consequence of the prior conviction.

 MR. CROOKS: But that argument could be made 

with respect to a person who is in the United States, who 

is subject to a term of probation where the only condition 

is that he not further violate the law. In that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, no, because --

MR. CROOKS: -- instance --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in that -- in that 

instance, action can be taken against him if he does 

further violate the law under the terms of probation. The 

point is that the jurisdiction of the probation office or 

the District Court doesn't extend to Mexico. 

MR. CROOKS: Well, that's true. But if we're 

talking about future violations of the law, it is very 

often the case that persons who are deported to Mexico do 

come back, and do have their supervised release --

MR. CROOKS: No, not at all, Your Honor, but I'm 

saying that, in the respect that you just talked about for 

the U.S. citizen, it's not any different, that the court 

retains jurisdiction to violate the supervised release, 

and to revoke it, and then to send him back to prison. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it is different, in the 

respect that he would first have to violate the law by 

entering the United States. 

MR. CROOKS: That is true. But in most cases, 

that is the only violation of supervised release for which 

they are later revoked. And, in that respect, it would be 

no different from a person who violates his probation by 

driving while intoxicated or committing some other legal 

violation.

imprisonment, even retrospectively, could have an impact 

on the ability to get a waiver of inadmissibility in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because the length of the 

sentence counts heavily in the attorney general's 

assessment, is that --

MR. CROOKS: That's correct, Your Honor. In 

Hamdi, they pointed out that the length of the sentence 

goes to two of the three factors that are evaluated by 

Immigration officials -- under a decision called Matter of 

Heronka -- that are used in evaluating whether a person 

should be granted a waiver of inadmissibility in the 

discretion of the attorney general --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think there's a 

realistic possibility that this person is going to be 

readmitted? A realistic possibility?

realistic possibility he's going to try to get readmitted, 

so that he can be subjected to really enforced supervised 

release?

visa at some point --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Has he applied for such a visa? 

Has he expressed any intention to apply?

have U.S.-citizen --

MR. CROOKS: But this Court has never held that

sentence can be moot while that sentence is still in 

effect, and when it can still have consequences for Mr. 

Toledo-Flores. And that's what distinguishes this case 

from all the other cases decided by this Court, is that 

the sentence itself is the concrete and continuing injury 

that defeats --

Breyer.

 I wanted to point out that, in Campo Serrano, 

which we've cited in our brief, this Court held that a 

deported alien's probation term was a continuing criminal 

sentence that saved the case from mootness. And the Court 

pointed to the fact that he -- that the deported alien in 

Campo Serrano could, just like Mr. Toledo-Flores, have his 

conditional release revoked, and he could be reimprisoned, 

upon a finding that he had violated his conditions. And 

we believe that Campo Serrano points very strongly in the 

direction that this case is not moot.

 On the merits, I would just like to point out

found to have committed aggravated felonies. That 

conclusion follows, not just from Section 924(c), but, 

more importantly, by the fact that what is relevant here 

is, What is the meaning of 1101(a)(43), which is the 

operative provision, which just happens to incorporate the 

definition of "drug-trafficking crime" from 924(c)? And 

there are three features of 1101(a)(43) with --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why don't you say "it just 

happens"? I mean --

MR. KNEEDLER: No. No. But -- no, but -- yes. 

No, it's --

 MR. KNEEDLER: It expressly incorporates it, 

yes. Yes. But the -- but the operative provision is 

section 1101(a)(43) of the INA, and there are three 

features of that that we think reinforce this conclusion. 

The first is that the consequences of aggravated felony 

status under the INA turn on whether one is convicted, not 

whether they have committed the crime, and that's true 

both with respect to the enhancement of sentences under 

1326 and the -- and the immigration consequences. And we

a conviction to look about how the -- to look at how the

crime is treated under the jurisdiction of conviction.

of Appeals have bought the Government's argument -- that 

there -- you do not need a conviction --

MR. KNEEDLER: Our point is not that 924(c) 

requires a conviction when it's in the Immigration Act, 

it's that the immigration consequences of that 

incorporation turn on whether someone was convicted of an 

aggravated felony. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is --

MR. KNEEDLER: So --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the ground of deportation 

that refers to "aggravated felony" refers to someone who 

has been convicted of an aggravated felony. The 

ineligibility for cancellation of removal turns on whether 

someone has been convicted of an aggravated felony, and 

the enhanced penalties under Section 1326 for someone 

whose illegal reentry, following aggravated felony, is for 

a conviction for an aggravated felony. So, my point is 

that, under the INA, the consequences turn on conviction, 

and it makes sense to look at the jurisdiction of 

conviction -- here, State law -- to see whether it -- to 

look at the -- to determine the status of the crime. And 

since State law determines it to be a felony, that's the

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if there is room for more 

than one construction of this statute, it seems to me 

unseemly, in the immigration context, to say that two 

people who have committed the identical acts, one of them 

is barred from ever coming back, doesn't have any of the 

dispensations, and the other does, because of the 

happenstance of the State in which they were convicted. 

That kind of disuniformity in an area where the 

Constitution expressly charges Congress with authority to 

make uniform laws, it's -- doesn't that uniform-law 

specification in the Constitution tug in the direction of 

the interpretation that Mr. Long was --

MR. KNEEDLER: No, we --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- presenting to us?

 MR. KNEEDLER: -- we think it does, for several 

reasons. First, with respect to the constitutional 

requirement, the uniformity provision applies to uniform 

rules of naturalization; that is, citizenship. This --

we're not talking about citizenship here, we're talking --

we're talking about the eligibility of aliens to remain in 

the country. Beyond that, even where the Uniformity 

Clause applies -- and there's, for example, a parallel 

Uniformity Clause for bankruptcy -- that's never been 

interpreted to mean that consequences of certain conduct 

under State law can have no impact on bankruptcy law, and

that there can't be a variation. The State-law homestead 

exemption under the -- under the bankruptcy laws is a good 

example of that. 

But, going beyond that, with respect to the 

issue of uniformity generally, Congress has established 

uniform standards in Section 1101, either in terms of 

identifying the conduct in certain instances; in other 

instances, by identifying the minimum sentence that was 

actually imposed. In this case, we think, with respect to 

drug-trafficking crimes, it -- it's imposed a uniform 

standard, in terms of the length of the sentence; it has 

to be a felony. That's -- that is uniformity. 

But the -- to answer your point more directly, 

it is a principle throughout 1101(a)(43) that one looks to 

State law, not to -- not to a -- some supposed uniform 

standard of Federal law. And, for example, if you --

several subparagraphs -- and if you'll -- 1101(a)(43) is 

set out at page 12(a) of the appendix to our brief --

three subparagraphs -- (j), (q), and (t) -- refer to the 

sentence that may be imposed for a violation. Well, when 

you're talking about a State conviction, that's clearly 

referring to the sentence that may be imposed under State 

law for a conviction. Four other subparagraphs -- (f), 

(g), (r), and (s) -- turn on the sentence that was 

actually imposed. That means that -- in the case of a

State crime, as we have here, that State law has to 

authorize the sentence, and that the State Court, applying 

State sentencing principles, has actually imposed a crime 

of -- for -- of at least 1 year. So, it is -- it is 

infused in Section 1101(a)(43) that, in fact, you do look 

to the consequences of an offense under State law. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm prepared to accept perfect 

ambiguity here, linguistically. And I thought of an 

empirical question, that you may know the answer to, that 

might shed some light. 

Now, going along the way -- maybe I'm making a 

mistake to point it out, if I am -- but I go to the key 

thing here, which is the words in 924(c), What is a 

"drug-trafficking crime"? A "drug-trafficking crime" is a 

crime -- "any felony punishable under the Controlled 

Substances Act." That could mean an act, physically, that 

is a felony under some law, and is also punishable under 

the Controlled Substances Act as a misdemeanor. Okay? 

Felony under -- it could pick that up. And it also could 

mean any conduct which is punishable as a felony under the 

Controlled Substances Act. And I could look at those 

words a thousand times and not have a clue which it means. 

So, I thought of an empirical test. This 

statute, 924(c), happens to be a statute that, if you 

engage in a drug-trafficking crime, as defined, and you

have a gun with you, you get mandatory 5 years. That's 

the point of it. And the Government does all the 

prosecuting. So, in how many cases where a person 

committed a misdemeanor offense, simple possession, and 

had a gun, did the Government insist that they get the 5-

years minimum? Now, if you're prepared to tell me "a lot 

of 'em," I'm prepared to tell you, the Government has 

consistently interpreted the statute the way you are now. 

But if you're prepared to tell me "zero," I would say I 

would be suspicious of an interpretation that comes along 

now for the first time. And my mind is open on it. I'm 

quite interested in the answer. 

MR. KNEEDLER: To my knowledge, we have not 

brought crime -- prosecutions under 924(c)(1), based on 

the circumstances you posit, but that's --

JUSTICE BREYER: But if --

MR. KNEEDLER: -- but I don't think that that 

goes very far with respect to answering this question. 

For one thing, as this Court pointed out in the Gonzales 

decision, the requirement that there be a Federal crime, 

and, therefore, a Federal felony under 924(c)(2), comes 

from the language in 924(c)(1) that says that the crime 

must be subject to prosecution in a court of the United 

States. And this Court, in Gonzales, said it's that 

language that renders the -- renders it a requirement that

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, I say it's 

suspicious. 

MR. KNEEDLER: But the question is not what 

924(c)(2) means, standing alone or in the abstract; it's 

what it means, as incorporated into 1101(a)(43). And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And, of --

MR. KNEEDLER: -- there --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- course, that's --

when you get to that, it must give you pause that your 

analysis is of a term, "drug-trafficking crime" or 

"illicit trafficking," and your theory leads to the 

conclusion that simple possession equates with drug 

trafficking.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the Petitioner has 

conceded, as I understand it -- I heard Mr. Long, I think, 

concede -- that possession offenses can constitute 

aggravated felonies under this provision, that there is 

the recidivist possession, there is the possession of the 

date-rape drug, there is possession of 5 grams or more of 

cocaine. All of those are specified as being -- of being 

felonies under the -- under 940 -- or 844. But, beyond 

that, it's important to take into account that a lot of 

State statutes dealing with drugs do not -- are not 

patterned directly after the Federal statute, and there's

no reason why Congress would have insisted that they do so 

in order for this statute to operate sensibly. And one 

notable example, for instance, is, when it comes to 

possession of a substantial amount of drugs, that that 

certainly would create a strong implication that the 

defendant was engaged in trafficking activities, or 

intended to. 

The Federal statute deals with that by making it 

a felony to possess with intent to distribute the drug.  A 

number of States don't do that. They, instead, have 

graduated possession offenses, based on the quantity of 

drugs that the defendant is possessing; that above a 

certain quantity of drugs, it would be a felony. They're 

getting at the same problem, but they've come at it in a 

different way. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then, in those cases, you can 

say the conduct would constitute a felony under the 

Federal statute; but here, if I recall correctly, the 

amount involved would not have qualified for possession 

with intent to distribute, under Federal law. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, it would always be up to 

the jury to decide that. Now, in Mr. Lopez's case, he was 

-- he was initially charged with a series of offenses that 

went beyond the aiding and abetting of possession that he 

ultimately pleaded guilty to, but, as he testified in his

-- in his immigration hearing, his aiding and abetting of 

possession was assisting someone in purchasing drugs, 

which was, itself, a trafficking element. And so, this 

shows that the way the State crimes are defined or applied 

are often getting at what Federal law --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes. We have a case in which 

we're assuming, for our purposes, we just have possession. 

I mean, I understand the facts of this case.  And I wanted 

to ask -- I have two questions, Mr. Kneedler. One of them 

-- the second one, I'd ask that -- you were going to 

mention three different points, one about conviction; you 

had two other points you didn't get to. I want to learn 

what those were. But, before that, it seems to me that, 

when you put the whole statute -- all the -- all the 

different statutory provisions together, you really boil 

down and focus on 924(c)(2) and the words "for purpose of 

this subsection, the term 'drug-trafficking crime' means 

any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances 

Act." And if the word "Federal" had been inserted before 

the word "felony" in the statute, would that not make the 

statute perfectly clear? 

MR. KNEEDLER: It probably would, but I think 

it's interesting that the version of 924(c) that was in 

effect prior to 1988 said exactly that. It said "felony 

violation of Federal law."

intended to be --

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, but --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- substantive --

MR. KNEEDLER: -- Congress --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- or merely --

MR. KNEEDLER: But --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- stylistic.

 MR. KNEEDLER: -- Congress did change it, in the 

1988 Act, but it did it -- and this is significant -- it 

did it in connection with two changes in the immigration 

law. One is the enactment of the definition of 

"aggravated felony," which, as I have explained, the 

definition of "aggravated felony" looks to State law, in a 

number of respects, in terms of the severity of the 

offense or the punishment actually imposed. That was one 

change. 

The other change that was made in the 1988 Act 

was to amend Section 1326 with respect to illegal 

reentries, and it did that by enhancing the penalty for 

conviction of any felony other than an aggravated felony, 

and an aggravated felony. And certainly the conviction of 

any felony includes State law offenses in this --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Just again, Mr. Kneedler --

focusing again on that specific language, you're saying, 

in effect, that that phrase means any State or Federal 

felony punishable under the Federal statutes. 

MR. KNEEDLER: It says -- yes, it says "any 

felony." And that is our -- doing it -- and what --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And is it ever true that a 

State felony is punishable under a Federal statute? 

MR. KNEEDLER: The conduct is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, I know, but --

MR. KNEEDLER: -- punishable. The conduct is 

punishable, not --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- but do you know of any 

instance where we've said a State felony is punishable 

under a Federal statute? 

MR. KNEEDLER: I think not -- I think not used 

in that sense, but I think it's important -- it's 

important to look at the language, as a whole. It does 

not say "punishable as a felony under" --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you do agree --

MR. KNEEDLER: -- "under the Controlled" --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- that the key to the case is 

how we read that one sentence. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, no, I agree that the -- I --

in my view, the key to the case is in 1101(a)(43),

because, if you look at the structure of 1101(a)(43) --

and this gets to the question you -- you said -- you 

mentioned that I had three reasons. One is that under the 

-- under the INA, the conviction consequences turn on the 

conviction of an aggravated felony, and it only makes 

sense to look at the jurisdiction of conviction to 

determine the nature of the crime, whether it's a felony. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but you don't -- you 

don't look to the jurisdiction of conviction. Are you 

telling me you require a conviction? You -- I thought you 

told me you don't require a conviction. 

MR. KNEEDLER: No. Under 924(c), you don't. 

But under the -- under the -- if you're bringing a Federal 

prosecution under 924(c), the term "aggravated felony" has 

no role in that determination. It is a -- it is a 

separate Federal crime. We're talking about, here, the 

consequences of -- the consequences of being an aggravated 

felon under 1101(a)(43) are, Where does the definition of 

"aggravated felony" apply? It only applies under the INA 

if someone has been convicted of an aggravated felony. 

You're only -- you're only subject to deportation for 

aggravated felony if you've been convicted, you're 

ineligible for cancellation or removal, you're subject to 

sentence enhancement. All those things follow on 

conviction. And we think it only makes sense to look to

the jurisdiction of conviction. That is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right, Mr. Kneedler, 

assuming that -- as I understand it, the answer you just 

gave, your second point, as well as the point that you and 

Justice Stevens were debating, turns, in your view, on a 

definition, or a reading, of the statute that would work 

this way: that if, under State law, the act were a felony, 

but, under Federal law, the action was merely a 

misdemeanor, it would still, for purposes of this 

definition, be an aggravated felony. 

MR. KNEEDLER: That's correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: That -- isn't that very 

strange, that Congress would have wanted a reading of the 

statute that would turn its definition of a "misdemeanor 

crime" into an aggravated felony for purposes of the 

immigration law? 

MR. KNEEDLER: I don't think so at all. And for 

one -- for one thing -- as I've mentioned, the structure 

of the act, as a whole, of 1101(a)(43) -- and there are 

numerous subsections -- look to how the crime -- what the 

authorized punishment was, or look to how the person was 

actually sentenced under State law, not under Federal law.

MR. KNEEDLER: I also haven't mentioned the 

explicit provision, that one of the other Justices 

mentioned earlier -- I think, the Chief Justice -- that 

the penultimate sentence of 1101(a)(43) says that 

something -- a -- an offense constitutes an aggravated 

felony, whether in violation of Federal or State laws.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well --

MR. KNEEDLER: So --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- I know it says that, but 

that doesn't necessarily take you any further than saying 

that if the words of the statute refer to something that 

could be a State law felony, under the -- under the 

penultimate sentence, it will count. It does not 

necessarily answer the question that we have, and that is 

whether a particular reference in the statute is a 

reference to a Federal felony or a State felony. So, it 

has a -- the penultimate sentence has work to do. And, in 

fact, we can see the work being done in the -- in the very 

definition of "drug trafficking" -- but it doesn't 

necessarily lead to the conclusion that you draw from it. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, we think -- we think it is 

quite a -- we think it's a strong confirmation of the 

pattern in 1101(a)(43), that the statute looks to what

authorized there, and the express mention of that -- or --

is to turn for -- turn the gravity of the Federal

felony. 

MR. KNEEDLER: The Federal Controlled Substances 

Act does not occupy the field of drug control in the 

country, any more than any other Federal crime occupies 

that field. And --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I realize that. But, if 

we're asking, "What is important in the mind of Congress, 

for purposes of the immigration law?" one would suppose 

that the most obvious touchstone of importance is the way 

Federal law deals with it -- i.e., in the case of a crime, 

whether Federal law calls it a felony or Federal law calls 

it a misdemeanor. You know, in your reading, when Federal 

law calls it a misdemeanor, if State law calls it a 

felony, it becomes a Federal felony for the immigration

law. And that's what seems to me odd. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Right. And this is not the only 

place where that consequence can arise. There are --

there are cases involving "What's a crime of violence?" 

which is -- which, under subparagraph (g), is another 

aggravated felony. The crime of violence is defined in 18 

U.S.C. Section 16, subsection (b) of that -- this Court 

considered that statute in Leocal -- requires that the 

offense be a felony which creates a serious risk of 

physical harm. The courts have looked to the State law of 

conviction to determine whether something is a felony --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, could --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but --

MR. KNEEDLER: -- under that provision. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: May I just ask one --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: It's one thing to turn to State 

law to get an answer where there is no other answer. The 

problem here is that State law and Federal law are at odds 

in determining the gravity of the offense. The Federal 

law, on my hypothesis, would say, "It is minor; it's just 

a misdemeanor." The State says, "No, it is a felony." It 

seems to me very odd, given the tension between the State 

and Federal classifications, to say that, for Federal 

purposes, the State classification is going to trump the

Federal classification; and that's a different situation 

from the one you posit. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, and -- if I could just 

mention one other -- on other example, under the theft-

offense category in subsection -- I think it's (f) --

where a theft offense is deemed to be an aggravated felony 

if a sentence of at least 1 year was imposed. There are 

misdemeanor offenses there that -- as a matter of Federal 

law, it can be a misdemeanor for certain types of theft 

offenses; and yet, they are covered as aggravated 

felonies. And, again, that would --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Kneedler, could I ask you 

about your assertion that you "look to the State of 

conviction"? What do you mean by that? For purposes of 

1101. Does that mean, if you're convicted, in State 

court, of a misdemeanor -- and even though that action 

would be a Federal felony, it's not an aggravated felony? 

MR. KNEEDLER: That is our position, yes. 

Because the requirement -- the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, it's sort of a double 

inconsistency. Not only do you treat State -- State 

actions that are -- that are minimal -- I'm sorry, where

enhancement, because it is not a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's extraordinary.

 MR. KNEEDLER: No, but it's -- that's not --

only true under this provision of 1101(a)(4). The other 

-- the other provisions -- (f) and (g) and (j) and (q) and 

(t) that I mentioned, that looked to the sentence that may 

be imposed under State law, or that was actually imposed 

-- would, likewise, render someone in that situation who 

was convicted of only a misdemeanor in State Court -- even 

though it might be a felony under Federal law, they would 

not be -- they would not be convicted of an aggravated 

felony, because --

write 1101(a)(43).

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- that a reasonable -- let's 

say the statute's ambiguous, and you've convinced us 

there's no constitutional requirement of uniformity. But 

is it reasonable to assume that Congress would want the 

different consequences to depend on the State of 

conviction?

legislative history suggesting that? 

MR. KNEEDLER: I think -- as I say, I think it's 

on face of the statute. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Barrett suggests otherwise. 

If what Congress was trying to do was to codify that 

practice of looking for an analogous crime under State 

law, that's -- that seems to me the -- at least what 

Congress was trying do. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, that -- the legislative 

history of the amendment in 1990 does not discuss the 

aspect of Barrett that went to the comparison to decide 

what -- in what circumstances there would be an analogous 

Federal crime. It was clear that it wanted to ratify the 

result that State crimes are covered. 

But we think that that was evident from the 1988 

amendments to -- that both enacted the definition of 

"aggravated felony," revised the definition of "drug-

trafficking crime" to delete the requirement that it be a 

Federal felony -- that was deleted in 1988 -- and enhanced 

sentences --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You --

MR. KNEEDLER: -- under 1326, clearly on the --

on -- by reference to whether someone was convicted of a 

State felony, without any -- without any general Federal 

minimum.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I --

MR. KNEEDLER: What Congress --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just switch gears for a 

moment, because your time is almost up, and we -- you 

haven't addressed the mootness problem in Toledo-Flores. 

MR. KNEEDLER: In Toledo-Flores. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is the Second Circuit wrong 

in U.S. v. Hamdi? Because it seems to me that U.S. v. 

Hamdi is on all fours with respect to mootness. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Yes. We think it is wrong, be --

under this Court's decision in Spencer versus Kemna and 

other cases, that, if the possible consequence turns on a 

discretionary judgment that may be made by someone else, 

that is too speculative to constitute a real live case or 

controversy. And that's what I understand Toledo-Flores 

to be arguing, is that if he applied for discretionary 

relief in the future, that it might -- it might matter, 

because his sentence might be reduced slightly. 

I should point out that in the District Court 

Toledo-Flores conceded that if he didn't get an eight-

level sentence enhancement, he would get a four-level 

sentence enhancement, because this is at least a felony, 

within the meaning of the adjacent provision of the 

guidelines. That would result in a guideline range of 24 

to 30 months. He would then have gotten 24 months, under

that guideline range, the very same thing that he got 

here. And, under the guidelines at the time, a term of 

supervised release was mandatory. And a 1-year term of 

supervised release was mandatory in those circumstances. 

He would have gotten exactly the same term of supervised 

release if he had been -- if he had gotten only the four-

level enhancement, rather than the eight-level 

enhancement.

 I also think that it is somewhat farfetched to 

think that, given the fact that Toledo-Flores had more 

than 12 illegal entries into the United States, and 

various State offenses, that the determination of whether 

the attorney general would actually grant discretionary 

relief would turn on a marginal difference in the sentence 

on that particular offense. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR. 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER LOPEZ 

MR. LONG: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

In answer to Justice Breyer's question, Mr. 

Kneedler said that a Federal misdemeanor is a drug-

trafficking crime under Section 924(c) if a State punishes 

it as a felony. He said, "Well, the Federal Government 

never prosecutes Federal misdemeanors under Section

924(c)." He said, "The reason is because of 

924(c)(1)(A)," and the language there is, it has to be an 

offense for which the person may be prosecuted in a court 

of the United States. But that language -- a person may 

be prosecuted in a court of the United States for a 

misdemeanor. So, the Government is making an argument 

that, to my knowledge, has never been accepted by any 

court, has not ever been advanced by the Government in a 

criminal context, and that would significantly expand 

Section 924(c) and numerous other criminal statutes that 

we cite in our brief that used the same definition of 

"drug-trafficking crime." 

The -- Mr. Kneedler also said that the 

aggravated felony provisions in Section 101(a)(43) refer 

to State law, but I read them just the opposite. There 

are two kinds. There are 21 of them. Many of them say, 

"an offense described in 18 U.S. Code Section X." I mean, 

that's really what -- we're dealing with one of those 

here. So, it clearly goes to Federal law to define the 

offense. Now, if State law or foreign law also punishes 

that offense, then it's an aggravated felony, but, 

clearly, Federal law is defining the offense.

 There are other categories, such as murder and 

theft, that are defined, in general terms; but the 

Government's position, as I understand it, is, again, you

use a generic uniform definition. You don't pick any 

definition that the States may have. The Court just 

granted --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought -- I 

thought you conceded that a State offense could constitute 

illicit trafficking --

MR. LONG: Well, yes --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in a Controlled 

Substance --

MR. LONG: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice. But, again, 

to be clear -- and I think this is consistent with the 

Government's position in other cases -- ultimately, there 

will be some uniform Federal definition of what 

constitutes illicit trafficking. It would be -- some 

commercial element would probably be the definition the 

Court hasn't decided. States can define it more broadly. 

But the actual definition -- just as the definition of 

"burglary" or "theft" --

JUSTICE ALITO: You think there's a uniform 

Federal definition of a theft offense? 

MR. LONG: Well, it's -- I mean, as -- this --

in the Taylor case, in burglary, the Court has a 

methodology for this. You pick a sort of generic 

definition. It may not -- it may not come from a Federal 

statute; it could --

JUSTICE ALITO: There's -- they'll -- there's no 

variation in State offenses that would fall within that, a 

theft offense?

 MR. LONG: Well, it's -- again, this is -- the 

provision we're dealing with is -- looks to Federal law, 

the Controlled Substances Act and two other statutes. My 

understanding of the Government's position -- and it's 

consistent with this Court's cases, in Taylor -- is that, 

even when it's a generic offense, you would -- you would 

still have a uniform definition. And that is certainly 

consistent with the principle of uniformity that applies 

both in criminal law and in immigration law. I mean, if 

there's any ambiguity, at the end of the day, ambiguities 

are supposed to be resolved in favor of uniformity, 

uniform Federal law -- uniform Federal criminal law, and 

uniform immigration law. Effectively, what the Government 

is arguing that -- is that States can banish noncitizens, 

and can do so by enacting drug laws, deciding to make a 

simple possession offense a felony. That's a decision 

that a State would make, almost certainly, for reasons 

that have little or nothing to do with immigration, and 

it's highly unlikely that Congress would have left that 

determination to States.

 On uniformity, aggravated felonies is a 

condition for citizenship. If you're convicted of an

aggravated felony, you may not become a U.S. citizen. You 

are foreclosed from establishing good moral character. 

So, in fact, citizenship is at stake here, and the 

Uniformity Clause is in play.

 If there are no further questions, thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. Long.
