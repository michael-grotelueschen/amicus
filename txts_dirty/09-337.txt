P R O C E E D I N G S 

(10:09 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear 

argument this morning in Case 09-337, Krupski v. Costa 

Crociere, S.p.A. 

Mr. Bendure. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. BENDURE 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. BENDURE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

This case revolves around Rule 15(c)(1)(C) 

of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In pertinent 

part, if two subsections are -- are satisfied, the rule 

permits relation back of an amendment adding a new 

defendant after expiration of the limitations period. 

The courts below found, and Respondent does 

not question, that we satisfied the first subsection: 

Notice and no prejudice. That arose from the service of 

the original complaint upon Costa Cruise, the agent and 

corporate affiliate represented by the same attorney as 

Respondent Costa Crociere. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know, Mr. Bendure, 

what exactly the corporate relationship was between the 

two? 

MR. BENDURE: No, Your Honor, not the

corporate relation. The functional relationship as 

described in the affidavit is that Costa Cruise is the 

booking agent for Costa Crociere. And for the notice 

procedure, according to the affidavit of Mr. Klutz, 

Costa Cruise engaged the IRSI adjustment service to 

resolve claims arising on the ship. So in that respect 

it was also, in our view, an agent of Costa Crociere. 

But the specific corporate relationship is not known. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Thank you. 

MR. BENDURE: Because of that timely service 

on Costa Cruise, we satisfied the first subsection. And 

as this Court noted in Schiavone, timely service on one 

defendant may serve to give imputed notice to a related 

defendant, which is what we have here. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, your --

your client tripped over the cable, right? 

MR. BENDURE: Correct. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if the case 

were there were two people behind her and she was 

pushed? And she didn't know which one pushed her, Jones 

or Smith. So she sues Jones, and Smith knows all about 

it because, of course, he's a key witness or whatever. 

Can he be substituted later on because he was the person 

she should have sued? 

MR. BENDURE: If you're talking about a lack

of knowledge of the real name, probably --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not just the real 

name. It's not that Jones pushed her, but his real name 

is Johnson. It's that Jones -- whoever pushed her; I 

forget -- but one guy --

(Laughter.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One of the people pushed 

her, and she named that -- she named the other person. She 

made a mistake about who pushed her. Can they have 

substitution in that case? 

MR. BENDURE: I would say yes, because --

again, assuming that all of the other criteria are 

satisfied. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. The non-pusher 

has notice --

MR. BENDURE: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and everything else. 

But there’s no relationship between the two of them. 

MR. BENDURE: It's -- it's obviously a 

slightly different and more difficult case from our 

perspective, but what I think is critical is the status 

that's involved. In this particular case, the suit was 

filed against the vessel operator, and that vessel 

operator was identified as Costa Cruise, when we know 

that the actual identity was Costa Crociere.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the first --

when was your first notice of that? I mean, it was on 

the first page of the ticket, but the answer came after 

the statute of limitations. Was that your first notice 

that there was this different entity, or did you know 

that earlier? 

MR. BENDURE: It was -- we say that was the 

first notice. Now, the circuit court used an imputed 

knowledge rationale to suggest that the inclusion of the 

name "Costa Crociere" within the definitions section 

gave us what I would call constructive notice. But in 

terms of actual knowledge that -- that we had sued the 

wrong party, it was the answer which was filed after --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you don't -- I didn't 

understand you to deny that the ticket made it very 

clear who operated the ship. 

MR. BENDURE: I'm not sure --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you contest that? 

MR. BENDURE: I contest that it makes it 

very clear, but I don't contest that one could conclude 

that that provided constructive notice, that if read 

carefully one might infer. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why not? Don't you 

read the contract carefully before you bring a lawsuit? 

MR. BENDURE: Well, actually it was under

definitions. And according to the definitions, Costa 

Crociere fell within the same definition of "carrier" as 

the steward, the ship itself, any --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you are -- you either 

are contesting or you’re not contesting that it's clear 

from the ticket. I had assumed it was clear from the 

ticket. 

MR. BENDURE: I’m not -- I am not agreeing 

that it's clear. I am agreeing that it provides 

constructive notice from which one might infer that. 

Not clear, but discernible. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you had -- so then you 

had notice even before the suit was filed. It was on 

the -- it was on the ticket. 

MR. BENDURE: We had what the circuit court 

referred to as “imputed knowledge.” Now, I think there's 

a --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the -- did the name 

show up any place other than page 1 of the general 

conditions of passage? 

MR. BENDURE: I don't believe so, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's -- and this is 

what? An 11-page, very small print --

MR. BENDURE: It's an 11-page, small print

document. And one thing that bears mention is that 

reference is under the designation "Definitions," 

because Respondent makes some hay out of the fact that 

we complied with other requirements which are under a 

different heading which says "Limitations of liability." 

But what we also had was that we purchased 

the ticket from Costa Cruise; it was sent by Costa 

Cruise. We had the pre-suit notice sent to Costa 

Cruise, responded by the -- the gentleman under the 

heading "Costa" that says "claims administrator for 

Costa Cruise." So there was certainly what I would call 

conflicting information at best about which was the name 

of the actual vessel operator. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not -- not if you read the 

definitions on page 1. And if you are not going to read 

all 11 pages before you file suit, I would think you 

would at least read page 1. And that, it seems to me, 

made it clear. 

MR. BENDURE: Well, it -- well, under the 

same definition, the steward would be a carrier every 

bit as much as Costa Crociere, S.p.A. So it seems to me 

by that reasoning you could conclude that the steward or 

the janitor is the vessel operator because they are 

likewise defined as the carrier in that definitional 

section.

And, in fact, it also includes the vessel 

itself within the definition. So let's assume that my 

client had, instead of suing Costa Cruise, sued Costa 

Magica, the name of the vessel itself. Most of the 

cases would say that an amendment like that to add the 

actual name, once you have identified the status of the 

defendant you seek to sue, falls within the 

subsection (ii), which is addressed primarily to the 

constructive notice of the defendant, that they knew or 

should have known that they would have been brought in 

the suit but for a mistake concerning the proper party's 

identity. 

But the general focus of that second subsection, 

I think, is to look to whether this defendant knew or 

should have known that it was the intended target. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me -- I’ve been 

thinking about the Chief Justice's question where the two 

people are pushed and you don't know which person -- or 

two people fired the shotgun, and there’s only one pellet, 

and you don't know which gun the pellet came from. In 

that case, I think we could stipulate that even by 

reasonable inquiry, you wouldn't know. 

In your case, I think the -- and I think the 

difference in the case is that "reasonable inquiry" 

means you should have known. So now we have a rule that

excuses something you should have known but doesn't 

excuse something you -- you couldn't have known, which 

seems odd. And because it's odd, therefore, maybe 

that's why it only applies to clerical errors. 

MR. BENDURE: Well, actually when it talks 

of mistake, it seems to me that the very notion of 

mistake connotes error. I looked at a couple of 

definitions, dictionary definitions. Merriam Webster's 

defines a mistake as, quote, "a wrong judgment" or, 

quote, "a wrong action or statement proceeding from 

faulty judgment, inadequate knowledge, or inattention." 

So, at least in that colloquial sense, the very nature of 

mistake implies some measure of blameworthiness. 

And, indeed, it's hard to conceive of a 

mistake that couldn't be avoided. And I think that's 

the problem with looking to the ticket, because what the 

definition on the ticket essentially says is: With due 

diligence, you might have avoided the mistake. 

But in my view, and I think in the view of 

the language of the rule, that doesn't change the very 

nature of it as being a mistake. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel --

MR. BENDURE: Certainly. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- assume I accept 

your argument, and I am the cruise operator -- the

cruise owner, cruise ship owner, and I look at the 

complaint, and I say: I think they really meant me, 

but -- I think. Now, within the 4(m) period, which is 

the period in which I am supposed to reasonably know 

that I would have been named absent a mistake, here an 

answer is filed, and you are told there is a mistake, 

and you don't correct the mistake. What conclusion 

would a reasonable person at that second juncture make 

about whether you made a mistake or not? 

MR. BENDURE: I think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And I think that's what 

the issue is here, which is, assuming the complaint 

could be read as a mistake during the 4(m) period, 

wasn't that mistake corrected, and you refused or failed 

to act? 

MR. BENDURE: Let me respond both legally 

and factually. Legally, I submit that it doesn't make a 

difference because under the text of the rule if during 

that 4(m) period they had the knowledge that you're 

suggesting and which would be suggested by the 

Respondent when they say, I think, if you had filed the 

amended complaint and served it a month after the answer, 

it would have been timely, we would have done it. 

That acknowledges that there was a mistake, 

and once there is a mistake, if during that 120-day

period they knew or should have known that it would have 

been brought against them but for the mistake, that 

knowledge doesn't evaporate by later events, as long as 

there is knowledge during that period. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That makes so little 

sense to me. Here I think -- and for the following 

reason: You seriously I don't think could contend that 

if you had sought to amend a year later, that that would 

have been timely, correct? 

MR. BENDURE: Correct. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. But putting 

aside prejudice --

MR. BENDURE: Okay. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- what the lower court 

said was because your delay speaks to a choice, that 

that's the only thing a reasonable defendant would have 

assumed, that having been told that you sued the wrong 

party and you continued in that action, that that's what 

you intended to do, to sue that wrong party. 

MR. BENDURE: Let me point out factually --

and I did not stress it in my brief. The answer was 

filed on February 25th. Twenty-three days later, on 

March 20th, the court entered a scheduling order which 

said: You have until the end of June to amend your 

complaint to add parties.

So it seems to me that a defendant faced 

with a court order that says the time for amendment 

extends till the end of June would not be drawing any 

conclusions that the plaintiff's state of mind had 

changed. And one difficulty with trying to look at 

different points during the 120-day period is that it 

seems to me you'd have a constantly moving target. 

If you say that we satisfied 120(m) at one 

point in time but somehow that's not enough and at a 

later point in time maybe they didn't know it any more, 

and then perhaps I guess in theory you could have them 

again -- if we had sent them a letter even after that and 

said, you know, we really did mean it, and then for some 

reason they concluded otherwise, you'd have a constantly 

moving target. And that's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bendure, would you 

explain one factual matter to me? I might have gotten 

this wrong, but I thought the answer was filed after the 

1 year had run. 

MR. BENDURE: It had. It had. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So when the answer was 

filed it was too late for you to come within the statute 

of limitations. 

MR. BENDURE: Absolutely true. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And I thought that would be

the answer that you would give to Justice Sotomayor, 

because when you got the answer -- which was filed after 

how many days? 

MR. BENDURE: It was filed I think 24 days 

after the complaint. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you had gotten that a 

few days earlier, you could have amended, and then we 

wouldn't be here. 

MR. BENDURE: That's certainly true, Your 

Honor. And I think it also --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. You have 

120 days to amend, don't you, from the filing of the 

complaint? 

MR. BENDURE: No, Your Honor. The 120 days 

is the time frame for the notice to the defendant. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right. 

MR. BENDURE: It -- 120 days after the amended 

complaint is our time for service of the amended --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Complaint. 

MR. BENDURE: -- complaint on the new defendant. 

But I think the point that is raised by Justice Ginsburg is 

this: Once we find out and the limitation period has already 

expired, school's out. If we tried to amend immediately 

thereafter -- if we hadn't made a mistake -- we couldn't 

amend 1 day after expiration of the limitation period.

So if we had acted immediately, we still 

don't get relation back unless we've satisfied the two 

criteria of the subsections. But if we do satisfy those 

within the 120-day period, then we fall in the safe 

haven provided by the rule whether the amendment itself 

occurs 1 week, 3 weeks, or 7 weeks afterwards. That --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the basic point is 

the answer didn't come in until you were already out 

under the statute of limitations. 

MR. BENDURE: Correct. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So from their point of 

view, nothing else matters; you were out when they filed 

their answer, and you could do nothing to cure that. 

MR. BENDURE: We could do nothing to, as a 

matter of right, file within the limitation period. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did your amended complaint 

contain any new and material allegations other than the 

name correction? 

MR. BENDURE: It actually was a second 

count, but it was the same allegations against Costa 

Crociere that had been made against Costa Cruise. We 

did not amend the theories of liability. And, again, 

getting back to the question of status and theories, I 

think that's the critical distinction between this case 

and the cases they rely upon, Ish Yerushalayim and

things like that, where you're changing from an 

individual defendant to an institutional defendant or 

vice versa on a different theory. And, of course, you 

couldn't mistake an individual for an institution. 

And that I think is the line of demarcation 

that we’re asking the Court to draw, and it explains 

why in the lower courts the decisions which present our 

paradigm all or virtually all allow relation back; 

whereas, those that seek to amend a change from an 

individual to a corporation or vice versa often don't 

permit relation back. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought that the only 

condition was that it had to arise out of the same event 

or transaction, which would give you much more running 

room than -- than what you assert. 

MR. BENDURE: Only if you’re amending 

against the same defendant. If you are adding a new 

defendant, you have to satisfy (i) and (ii), which look 

to the notice and reason to know of the new defendant. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bendure, in addition 

to the mailing of the ticket -- the mailing of the 

ticket came; it said "Costa Cruise" -- were there any 

other connections between the plaintiff passenger and 

Costa Cruise beyond the ticket coming in an envelope 

that says "Costa Cruise"?

MR. BENDURE: There was the -- the pre-suit 

claims notice which was sent to Costa Cruise at the 

Florida address, in attempted compliance with the 

provision of the ticket which says you must file notice 

to the carrier before filing suit. And you have to do 

that within 185 days. 

So we not only got the ticket from Costa 

Cruise -- we bought it from Costa Cruise -- the ticket 

itself, if you look at I think it's 25a of the 

appendix to the petition for certiorari, there is a 

prominent page which says "Costa Cruise, cruise company" 

next to a picture of the vessel. So we have that. 

Then when we filed the notice, we sent it to 

Costa Cruise, we get a letter back from a person who 

claims to be in a position to resolve the liability of 

the vessel over -- owner, signed by him as claims 

administrator for Costa Cruise. 

Those are the things -- oh, and then we 

have, prior to the commencement of suit, the 

Internet investigation about which Florida company is 

registered to do business in the State of Michigan, and 

we look at the Costa Cruise Web site, which says: "Costa 

Crociere with several offices in several countries, 

United States office, Costa Cruise, Florida." 

So those are some of the things which give

rise to the mistake --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Bendure, can -- can I 

come back to your -- I'm not sure why it matters, but it 

seems to me you’re giving too narrow an interpretation, 

and I would not like our opinion to read any more 

narrowly than the statute allows. 

It seems to me that if you assert a 

different claim arising out of the same transaction, you 

would be able to amend. If you will look at (c)(1)(C), 

which is what you’re asserting here, right? (C)(1)(C) 

says, “the amendment changes the party or the naming of 

party against whom the claim is asserted, if Rule 

15(c)(1)(B) is satisfied.” Then you go back to (1)(B) 

and it says, “the amendment asserts a claim or defense 

that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence 

set out.” 

It doesn't say it has to be the same claim. 

MR. BENDURE: There’s no question we 

satisfy that. Everybody agrees. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. That's 

why I don't understand why you’re arguing a more 

narrow -- a more narrow interpretation. 

MR. BENDURE: Because I’m forced to --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. GLAZIER 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. GLAZIER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

There are, we suggest, two issues before the 

Court: The first is the legal question of whether a 

plaintiff's knowledge about the identity of the proper

party can preclude a finding that there was a mistake 

concerning the identity of the proper party. That, we 

suggest, is in some ways the easier issue, because there 

are -- there’s abundant authority from the circuit 

courts of appeal and from this Court in Nelson v. Adams 

USA, where the Court said the rule requires a mistake. 

In that case, there was no mistake. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Glazier --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's no mistake if you 

happen to know it, if you happen to know who the right 

party is? 

MR. GLAZIER: Correct. And --

JUSTICE BREYER: Ever? 

MR. GLAZIER: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Have you ever driven a car 

where your wife has said turn left and you’ve turned 

right? 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: Has that ever happened to 

you? 

MR. GLAZIER: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Was there anything you 

didn't know?

Honor --

sometimes I make mistakes knowing all the facts, and so 

do you and so does everybody else. So I never heard of 

this thing that you can't make a mistake knowing all the 

facts. But anyway, here we have a person who didn't 

know all the facts. What the judge says is he should

My wife told me to turn left and I turned right, okay? 

But I didn't take it in. 

MR. GLAZIER: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: So that's a different 

matter. Where does it say that he did know the facts as 

opposed to he should have known the facts? 

MR. GLAZIER: The circuit court refers --

talks about imputed knowledge. We disavow that. There 

was no need for imputed knowledge in this case. What 

imputes knowledge is someone who does not have 

knowledge. Courts and lawyers make that up. If you 

don't have knowledge --

JUSTICE BREYER: I just want the citations 

to the page. I wasn't challenging you. I just wanted 

the citations to the page --

that, in fact, he knew that this company called "Costa

Cruise" in Italian is the same as the company called 

"Costa Cruise" in English? I take it "Crociere" means 

"cruise." 

MR. GLAZIER: They are -- they're separate 

corporations. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, yes. One is called 

"Costa Cruise" in Italian and one is called "Costa 

Cruise" in English. And I just want to know where it 

says in the record that the client or he, the lawyer, 

actually knew, actually knew that he should have sued 

the one that spells its name in Italian? 

MR. GLAZIER: They are separate 

corporations. There’s nothing in the record that says --

JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't ask you that 

question. I'm asking for a record citation as to where 

there is a finding that this particular plaintiff knew 

that the Italian company called "Costa Cruise" was in 

fact the one he should have sued? 

MR. GLAZIER: There is a finding --

JUSTICE BREYER: I’ll write them down and 

look at them later. 

MR. GLAZIER: The finding on page 19a of the 

district court opinion says --

says "Her failure to timely naming Costa Crociere, 

S.p.A. as defendant." 

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought what the district 

court said was “impute” the knowledge. 

MR. GLAZIER: No. No, the district court 

did not impute knowledge, and this is an important 

point. The circuit court imputed knowledge, and --

JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that? 

Where does it say that on 19a? 

MR. GLAZIER: 19a -- it's not precisely it, 

but it says, "Her failure to timely named Costa Crociere 

as defendant was not the result of a mistake." It does not 

specifically say --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I -- I know. I would 

say in reading this, that both courts have made the most 

elementary mistake of the English language in thinking 

that when a person doesn't know something but should 

have known it, that that’s inconsistent with a mistake. 

That's the very definition of a mistake. 

MR. GLAZIER: Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, all I want is some 

citation from you that shows that isn't what they 

thought.

me, when I hear I want to run out the door, because what 

the word "constructive" to me means is not knowledge.

ticket. There is no doubt, no doubt whatsoever, that 

the plaintiff or her attorney read --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any other than 

that one page on the ticket, that against the mailing 

envelopes that she got that say "Costa Cruise" -- is 

there anything in the entire record other than that 

definition page that includes carrier, that includes 

steward, anything else that tips her off that this is a 

different corporation? 

MR. GLAZIER: There are three different 

pieces of evidence. The first is the ticket. The 

ticket defines carrier as Costa Crociere. It is the 

only entity stated by name --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It says it includes 

stewards. What do you -- what do you say to that? 

MR. GLAZIER: I'm sorry. I didn’t --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It includes the stewards on 

the boat, according to your -- your friend. 

MR. GLAZIER: It lists one entity by name, 

Costa Crociere, and lists others by role. Now, there 

may be some dispute over whether --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why can't Costa 

Cruise be perceived to hold one of those roles? 

MR. GLAZIER: Well, one might argue that 

there might be a number of different entities that might

be a carrier, but there is only one entity which is 

clearly the carrier, indisputably a carrier. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What is the relationship 

between those corporations? 

MR. GLAZIER: Costa Crociere is, I believe, 

one level removed an owner of Costa Cruise Lines. Costa 

Crociere operates around the world. They have different 

companies that operate as sales and marketing agents in 

different regions. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But are they -- are they 

sister corporations, a parent-sub --

MR. GLAZIER: No. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- or what? 

MR. GLAZIER: Costa Crociere is parent, and I 

believe there’s a corporation below them, and then that 

corporation owns Costa Cruise Lines. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: When it's below them, you 

mean it owns all the shares in its -- in its subsidiary 

company? 

MR. GLAZIER: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You know, the -- the 

definition of carrier includes independent contractors. 

I mean -- I -- I would -- other than that they are more 

closely related, I can see someone thinking, well, Costa 

Cruise is at least an independent contractor with which

Costa Crociere does business. 

MR. GLAZIER: There might be more than one 

carrier, but there is one carrier identified by name. 

It is the first -- it is the first person listed. Costa 

Crociere is the carrier. I -- I suggest that if one 

reads the first page of the ticket, one might have 

questions about whether there might be some other 

entities that are carriers, but there is simply no doubt 

that Costa Crociere is the carrier. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And if you went to --

MR. GLAZIER: Now, there is no --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you went to the Web site, 

which was mentioned, for Costa Cruise, there would be a tab 

that says "Our ships" "Our ships" -- and one of those ships 

is Costa Magica, whatever. 

MR. GLAZIER: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: "Our ships," and it 

identifies Costa Cruise as the cruise operator. That's 

the information that's given to passengers in the United 

States who are going to book on these ships. It says 

Costa Cruise, our ships, Costa Cruise is the operator. 

That's what was being put forth to the public. 

MR. GLAZIER: What -- what -- the relationship 

between the parties was governed by the ticket. The 

ticket says, for example, the claim against the carrier

has to be filed within the Southern District of Florida. 

This claim was filed in Southern District of Florida, 

but they did not sue the carrier as identified on the 

ticket. And the question is was there a mistake 

concerning the identity of the proper party --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it shouldn't matter 

that this confusion was caused in large part by this 

entity that advertises in English under the name "Costa 

Cruise" and identifies Costa Cruise as the operator. 

"The largest European cruise operator" is how Costa 

Cruise is -- is identified in -- in the advertising. 

MR. GLAZIER: We -- we believe that the 

ticket is clear, and that governs. But even if one would 

disagree with that, then we move forward. If there were 

any confusion, there’s an answer filed. Costa Cruise 

Lines is sued. Costa Cruise Lines denies that it can be 

held liable, says it wasn't the carrier, it wasn’t --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the answer is filed 

conveniently after the 1-year period has run. 

MR. GLAZIER: The answer is filed, but the 

question of whether the defendant knew or should have 

known that there -- it -- it would have been sued but 

for a mistake, the inquiry there is not within the 

limitations period. It was until the 1991 amendment, 

which followed the Schiavone case.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but I don't --

I mean, there’s some sharp practice going on here. 

Paragraph 10 of their complaint sues Costa Cruise Lines 

because -- saying they owned, operated, managed, 

supervised, and controlled the ocean-going passenger 

vessel. And it's the same lawyer for Costa Cruise as 

for Costa Crociere, right? 

MR. GLAZIER: Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So that 

lawyer looks at this and says: Aha, they made a 

mistake; they named the cruise line rather than the name 

in Italian. So I'm going to wait until the statute of 

limitations runs, and then a couple of days after, I'm 

going to say aha. 

MR. GLAZIER: The statute of limitations is 

not the measuring period. It was before the 1991 

amendment. Now, what happened here is the answer is 

filed, which makes clear the defendant -- the defendant 

Costa Cruise Lines denies it was involved with the 

ownership, operation, or management. That's Joint 

Appendix 30. Joint Appendix --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did the answer say the 

statute -- the 1-year period has run? Was that raised 

as a defense in the answer? 

MR. GLAZIER: It was not raised in the -- in

the defense -- it was not raised as defense in the 

answer. It -- it was not. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: When was it raised as a 

defense? 

MR. GLAZIER: It was raised 10 weeks later 

in a motion for summary judgment, which was still within 

the Rule 4(m) period, and that is the crucial period. 

If upon reading the answer, which says the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- the Rule 4(m) 

period concerns when you can serve. It doesn't say that 

the statute of limitations is any more than what was the 

term of the -- of the passage, was 1 year. 

MR. GLAZIER: Well, the Rule 4(m) period is 

awfully important because Rule 15(c) turns on, since 

1991, on the Rule(4)(m) period. If during the Rule 4(m) 

service period, the -- it became clear to Costa Crociere 

that it was an intended defendant, that it would have 

been sued but for a mistake, then the complaint against 

Costa Crociere would relate back, even though it was not 

timely filed. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, that -- that 

assumes -- that assumes -- when, what is it, 1(C)(ii), 

"knew or should have known," it says within the period 

provided by rule 4(m). Now, in the early part of that 

period, at -- at one point in the period you should have

known. And at another point, because the answer was 

filed, you shouldn't have known. 

MR. GLAZIER: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And you're relying on the 

fact that they filed an answer which -- I'm sorry --

that -- that you filed an answer which made it very 

clear to them what the situation was. But was there any 

point, any -- and all it takes I think is any point 

within that 4(m) period -- when you -- you knew or should 

have known? 

MR. GLAZIER: The answer, we submit, is no. 

When they filed the complaint, the complaint indicated a 

couple of things. First of all, they were suing Costa 

Cruise Lines, but they had read -- the complaint made 

clear that they had read the ticket. They specifically 

relied on the venue provision of the ticket. So we knew 

that they had read the ticket, which clearly identifies 

Costa Crociere as being the carrier, yet they still --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where -- where is the 

defense -- I mean, the ticket says suit must be filed 

within 1 year of the date of any alleged injury. And 

where is the -- that defense stated? You said it comes 

up 10 weeks --

judgment, which -- which is not in the joint appendix.

It's docket entry 19. The affidavit which is -- was

the Joint Appendix at Joint Appendix 33. And the 

motion -- the answer made clear that Costa Crociere is 

the carrier which could be liable, not Costa Cruise 

Lines --

test case. All right, did this plaintiff really not --

JUSTICE BREYER: What possible reason is 

there that somebody who is hurt on a ship and has a 

lawyer, and she has a broken leg, and she'd like to get 

recovery, would deliberately sue the wrong person? 

MR. GLAZIER: The plaintiff --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there such a reason? 

MR. GLAZIER: The evidence in the record is 

that the plaintiff's lawyer looked at the Web site and 

chose a United States corporation instead of --

JUSTICE BREYER: And I’m just saying, did he 

do it by mistake? If you were representing this person, 

would you want to sue the company that could give you 

some money if they are liable? Or would you rather sue 

the Bank of America that has nothing to do with it? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. GLAZIER: Well, if it were -- if I had 

to sue Costa Crociere through the Hague Convention in 

Genoa, maybe a lawyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I want to ask you 

about that, because in your brief you refer in your 

footnote on page 6 to requirements of the Federal 

Government 44101-44103. So I looked those up. I 

discovered that 44103 says that it is a requirement, and 

you say you follow these requirements, that you shall

establish under regulations of the FMC financial 

responsibility. 

And those regulations tell you that, at 

least as best I could read them, that you must furnish a 

written designation of a person in the United States as 

a legal agent for service of process, and they are 

referring to instances in which somebody on a ship 

suffered an accident. 

So since you say that you are complying with 

that, I would like to know the name and address of that 

person in the United States for whom you must send legal 

process, because if obviously that had been on the 

ticket, that is precisely the man to whom this plaintiff 

would have sent the notice. 

MR. GLAZIER: I cannot answer the question 

now. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well then, were you correct 

when you said in your -- in your brief that this company 

which you represent does comply with 44103? 

MR. GLAZIER: My understanding is the answer 

is yes, but I cannot address the specific question. 

I submit --

JUSTICE BREYER: It is relevant, I think, 

because it adds to the confusion if they are under a 

legal requirement to have a service -- an agent to

receive service, and then they not only don't do it, but 

they don't have it printed on the ticket. And they get 

everybody mixed up by having the same name in English, 

or a very similar one, and announcing someone you’re 

supposed to serve, and then it turns out to be not that 

person you’re supposed to serve. It's a mysterious 

person that you can't find. 

MR. GLAZIER: But the question, though --

JUSTICE BREYER: It seems odd. I’d like 

to know what the explanation is of this. 

MR. GLAZIER: Well, the question is not a 

more generalized blame explanation, but under the rule, 

the language of the rule, whether Costa Crociere knew or 

should have known that the action would have been 

brought against it but for a mistake concerning the 

proper party's identity. 

And the most problematic case -- part of the 

case for the plaintiff is why, when they were told in 

the answer that they had not sued the proper party, that 

Costa Cruise Lines was not the carrier, was not the 

operator, but Costa Crociere is, why did the plaintiff 

not do anything? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we -- let's clarify 

that point now. I am looking at 3a, which is the court 

of appeals opinion, and it says that "Costa Crociere

moved to dismiss, arguing that it had been sued after 

the 1-year ticket period allowed for claims set 

forth" -- as set forth in the ticket. Then the rule 

tells us that you have this much time to serve, and 

then the complaint will -- the -- the amendment will 

relate back to the date of the original filing. 

It doesn't change your statement, your 

defense. The 1-year statute of limitations isn't 

affected. What is affected is the complaint will 

relate back if there’s an amendment filed. But the 

1-year statute of limitations remains, and you didn't 

bother to answer until the -- that time had run. 

MR. GLAZIER: But if -- if, during the 

120-day period -- you know, the Rule 15(c) happens to 

rely upon the measuring point, but service is not the crucial 

point. Within that 120-day period, if the plaintiff had 

done anything, anything at all, to indicate that she had 

not sued Costa Crociere because of a mistake, then the 

complaint would have related back, a very easy case. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but the relation 

back is different from the point at which the statute 

has run. The statute runs after 1 year. Then, if she 

does what the rules say, it can relate back to the date 

of the original filing. The fact remains that you 

didn't file your answer until after the limitation

MR. GLAZIER: Yes. Yes, we did not file the 

answer. They filed the lawsuit on the eve of the --

JUSTICE ALITO: Why does that even matter? 

I'm not really sure I'm following this argument. Let's 

say that the answer was filed during the limitations 

period, and the lawyer -- the plaintiff's lawyer is a 

solo practitioner, and he or she is out of the office 

because the lawyer's on a cruise --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- and doesn't come back 

for 2 weeks. And by that time, the limitations period 

has run. It's still a mistake. 

MR. GLAZIER: If --

JUSTICE ALITO: Where do you see in --

the question on which cert was granted has to do with 

imputed knowledge. Where do you see in the text of this 

rule anything that picks up the concept of either imputed 

knowledge or actual knowledge? It just talks about a mistake. 

MR. GLAZIER: We do not rely at all upon 

imputed knowledge. The Court granted review, but we 

don't think there is imputed knowledge here. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, where -- just -- where do 

you -- where in the rule is there anything that relates to the 

reasonableness of the mistake? What if it is the most

foolish, negligent mistake you can possibly imagine? Is 

it not still a mistake? 

MR. GLAZIER: The rule contemplates by its 

structure that the mistake will be the cause of the 

reason why the -- the plaintiff did not sue the parties. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That’s not what the 

rule says. That’s not what the rule says. The rule 

doesn't talk about what kind of mistake or why. The 

rule says what the defendant should have known. And so, 

when you read this complaint, it's very clear you know 

you’re the carrier. 

MR. GLAZIER: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You know cruise -- the 

other line, the sales agent, can't be the carrier, 

correct? 

MR. GLAZIER: We --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it's either a factual 

or a legal mistake. There is no other way to read that 

other than that there is a mistake. 

MR. GLAZIER: And then --

to answer Justice Breyer's question, which is: What 

conceivable reason that is not either negligence or 

unintentional or inadvertent or just plain stupidity,

injured would want to name a party who wasn't 

responsible for the injury? 

MR. GLAZIER: The most powerful evidence is 

simply when they were informed of the claimed mistake, 

they did nothing for 95 days to indicate in any manner 

whatsoever that it was a mistake. They had --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that's evidence from 

which the absence of a mistake might be inferred. I 

agree with that, but that doesn't establish that it 

wasn't -- it wasn't a mistake. 

MR. GLAZIER: Well, this -- whether 

something is a mistake ultimately is a factual issue. 

There’s a legal question of whether a plaintiff's 

knowledge of the identity of a proper party can preclude 

a finding of mistake. But once we get past that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But, counsel, don't --

what you’re really talking about is whether once the 

answer was filed, they were dilatory in making their 

motion. I don't understand how you can argue that the 

day you received this complaint, you didn't understand 

that some sort of mistake had been made. 

The day that the answer came in, you might 

start to have a doubt because of their delay in the 

motion to amend, but doesn't that go to a 15(a) 

question, whether the judge should have given leave to

amend because of dilatory tactics? Isn't that a 15(a) 

question, not a 15(c) question? 

MR. GLAZIER: Well, delay in moving to amend 

via 15(a). But 15(c) requires the judge to determine 

whether there was a mistake. And here, in essence, we 

have a test case: Well, the plaintiff is claiming that 

the reason why she did not sue Costa Crociere --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there anything in the 

face of the complaint that would suggest anything but a 

mistake? Now, forget -- I'm being very specific. On 

the face of the complaint. You read that. 

MR. GLAZIER: Yes, I believe there is. The 

complaint specifically makes clear that the plaintiff's 

lawyer read the ticket. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Where does it say that? 

Where does it say: "I know that the carrier is Costa 

Crociere"? Where does it say that? 

MR. GLAZIER: The complaint certainly does 

not say that. What --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What the complaint says 

is that Costa Cruise, the operator of the vessel, 

injured me, correct? 

MR. GLAZIER: It says that the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And is that an accurate 

statement of fact?

said the previous paragraph, 9, says: "The plaintiff 

has complied with all the pre-suit requirements of the 

passenger ticket." So you know they read the ticket. 

MR. GLAZIER: Right. And in the paragraph 

before, venue is proper in Broward County; defendant's 

passenger ticket contains a forum selection. So we know 

when Costa -- Costa Cruise Lines, or Costa 

Crociere learns of this, we know that the plaintiff 

decided --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, which is it? 

Is that a Freudian slip? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. GLAZIER: No. No, because we’re --

because we’re not disputing --

they have read the ticket, and despite that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I object to your relying 

upon the -- the answer as -- as establishing compliance 

with (C)(ii), because (C), in the prologue, says "is 

satisfied, if within the period provided by Rule 4(m)." 

And there is at least some point within that 

period before the answer was filed. And if, within that 

period before the answer, you knew or should have known 

that it was a mistake, it seems to me you lose. 

Do you understand what I'm saying? 

MR. GLAZIER: I understand what you’re 

saying, but there’s nothing in -- just the point --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the -- the only 

thing you could rely on for that short period before the 

answer is filed is simply the ticket, right?

MR. GLAZIER: There’s nothing in the rule --

the ticket and the complaint -- there’s nothing in the 

rule that says that only events up to point of the 

running of the limitations period or the service of the 

answer are relevant. It is throughout the certain --

within the period --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you are reading 

"within the period" to mean "throughout the period." It 

doesn't say “throughout the period.” It says “if within 

the period.” 

MR. GLAZIER: Well, the district court, 

which is serving as the fact-finder there, looked at all 

the evidence. And the powerful evidence is the service 

of the answer, which identifies the party --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's an important 

issue with respect to the statute. I don't think we can 

treat cavalierly whether "within the period" means 

"throughout the period." That's one of the issues here. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one -- one question 

about the face of the ticket, the one with the picture 

on it. Is it Costa Cruise or Costa Crociere that got 

this big award for “B.E.S.T. 4”? 

MR. GLAZIER: I -- I don't know the answer 

to that.

MR. GLAZIER: I don't know the answer at 

this time. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I make the assumption that 

it's the cruise line, Crociere, that got the award. So 

the ticket itself confuses the two companies. 

Is that a mistake, incidentally? 


(Laughter.) 


JUSTICE KENNEDY: If I am right, is that a mistake? 


MR. GLAZIER: I -- Your Honor -- clearly, as 


you said, Costa Crociere is the vessel operator. The 

ticket makes it clear on the next page, the very next 

page --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: How many -- if you have a 

1,000-page ticket, how many pages do you have to read? 

MR. GLAZIER: Here, you only have to read 

one. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But this is the first one. 

MR. GLAZIER: Well, this is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: The one I pointed out to 

you with the mistake, that’s the first one. 

MR. GLAZIER: It’s -- it’s on the cover. 

The ticketing agent here, Costa Cruise Lines, adds the 

cover. The first page of the provisions say Costa 

Crociere is the -- is the vessel operator.

there’s no response. No response, and then a motion for 

summary judgment. Still nothing. If the plaintiff had 

merely said in an e-mail or a phone call, hey, I made a 

mistake, then it would be clear. An easy case. But 

they did not act despite being informed. Despite being 

informed in the answer of the identity of the proper 

party and in the motion for summary judgment. The trial 

court, serving as the trier of fact here on this issue, 

had to make that decision. Maybe the court with another --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm still puzzled, because 

Rule (C) just requires -- describes the state of mind of 

the defendant, correct? C(i) and (ii); isn't that 

right? 

MR. GLAZIER: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And is it not true that 

under (i), the defendant did receive such notice of the 

action, would not be prejudiced? That's clear, isn't it? 

MR. GLAZIER: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And is it also true that 

at the time they received the complaint, they knew or 

should have known that the action would have been 

brought against the carrier instead of the broker?

show that there’s --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't think -- you 

don't think that the agent didn't realize that they 

would have sued the carrier if they had known the 

identity of the right party? 

MR. GLAZIER: What is known is that they had 

the ticket. They still decided --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand all that. 

MR. GLAZIER: -- to sue Costa Cruise Lines --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But we're talking about the 

-- about mindset of the defendant, and to say that they 

wouldn't have sued -- they would have sued the broker 

instead of this carrier? It's absurd. 

MR. GLAZIER: Well, the events played a role and 

demonstrated that even after the plaintiff was informed 

of the identity of the proper party, they continued to 

pursue the claim against the ticketing agent.

a good grasp of the facts and the issues in our 

arguments. I’d just like to clarify a couple of 

factual points. 

The district court ruling didn't rely on the 

ticket at all. What the district court said was: I 

adopt the legal premise that if you knew before the 

filing of -- before the running of the statute of 

limitations but didn't sue, that would not be a 

mistake. And here, says the district court judge, they 

filed their answer after the statute of limitations, and 

that's why you lose under a rule that requires that 

notice before the statute of limitations expires. That 

was the district court rationale. 

The circuit court was the one who relied 

upon the imputed knowledge notion that is now, I think, 

disavowed by Respondent himself. 

With regard to the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This is sort of an 

equitable rule, isn't it, this mistake? We're going to, 

you know -- equity takes account of such things. It 

seems to me very reasonable to say: If the mistake is 

egregious, it doesn't apply. 

MR. BENDURE: I think now one gets into a 

wonderful process of trying to identify mistakes on a 

scale of egregiousness. Like, how many points of

egregiousness would it take? And I think that's beyond 

the statute, or the court rule itself, which just uses 

the plain language "mistake." 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought 

your answer would have been: This has nothing to do 

with equity at all. It's just the interpretation of a 

legal rule. 

MR. BENDURE: Certainly. And the rule 

itself -- I understood Justice Scalia's point to be that 

the interpretation of the rule is designed to be liberal 

in its application to avoid the forfeiture of 

potentially meritorious causes of action over technical 

mistakes which have nothing to do with the merits. I 

thought that was the sense in which you used the word 

"equitable." 

The other point I’d like to make, even 

though it's, in my view, legally insignificant, is their 

argument regarding the nature of the delay. Their 

motion for summary judgment was filed on May 6th. Two 

days later, the court erroneously dismissed the lawsuit 

for a period of approximately a month. It was then 

reinstated on June 5th, and our response, which sought 

relation back, was filed on June 13th. 

So in addition to the scheduling order, 

there is a 1-month period of time in which the case was

erroneously dismissed. So if it were significant, we 

could say there’s not significant delay. But the 

ultimate point is it's legally beside the point. 

If the Court has no further questions, 

I'll --

JUSTICE BREYER: This might be tangential, 

but is there a reason to suggest the Federal Maritime 

Commission look into this? Because I read the regs. I 

don't understand quite what's going on, because it seems 

to me they have a rule that is designed to prevent this 

situation. 

MR. BENDURE: It may well --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that true, what I'm suggesting 

or not? You know the area better. 

MR. BENDURE: I don't know. I'm not a 

maritime lawyer, Your Honor. But I think certainly if 

the Court's opinion were to note it, the Maritime 

Commission might well take a hint from the opinion and 

look into it. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

MR. BENDURE: Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is submitted.
