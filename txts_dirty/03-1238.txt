 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Court will now hear 

argument in IBP, Inc. vs. Alvarez and Tum vs. Barber 

Foods, Inc.

 Mr. Phillips.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

There are two issues in this case. One concerns 

walking time, and the other concerns waiting time. And 

unless the Court has a different order, I'd propose to 

start with the walking time.

 Section 4(a)(1)'s language, which comes from the 

Portal-to-Portal Act, which was enacted in 1947, by its 

plain terms clearly covers the walking that's involved in 

these two cases. The statute, which is reproduced at the 

appendix of the petition, at 88(a), says that there is no 

mandatory compensation for, quote, "walking to and from 

the actual place of performance of the principal activity 

or activities which such employee is employed to perform."

 It's difficult for me to imagine language that 

could more directly cover what we're dealing with in this 

particular case, because the Plaintiffs here are -- for

IBP -- are employed to slaughter and to process beef. The 

employees at Barber Foods are employed to process chicken. 

And thus, the actual place where they perform those 

services are obviously on the lines where the processing 

takes place.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I would have thought that, but 

we've held otherwise.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know that we've --

I don't know of any case where this Court has held 

otherwise.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we've held that they're 

-- that the principal activity consists of doffing --

donning and doffing the clothes required, haven't we?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, this Court said that 

donning and doffing was a principal activity in 

contradistinction to a preliminary or postliminary 

activity for purposes of section 4(a)(2), but the Court 

specifically said, in Steiner, that that holding does not 

apply to matters that are specifically excluded under 

section 4(a)(1), which deals with walking time, Justice 

Scalia.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: So, you think Steiner is 

irrelevant?

 MR. PHILLIPS: For -- no, I don't think it's 

irrelevant to the workplace. I think it is irrelevant to

the proper disposition of this case, yes.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it is if we don't accept 

the continuous workday rule. If we do accept the 

continuous workday rule, why isn't it, in effect, the 

premise from which the conclusion for the other side 

falls?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, we don't have any quarrel 

with the continuous workday rule. The question is, When 

does the workday begin? And our assessment of the 

workday, as defined in section 4(a)(1), which controls, 

specifically, the walking time in this particular case, 

begins when you arrive at the actual place where you're 

going to perform the services --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but your argument --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- or primary activities.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- assumes that there is only 

one actual place. And their argument, which is consistent 

with the text of the statute, is that there may be more 

than one principal activity, and hence, more than one 

place. And if the -- if the place of donning and doffing 

is such a place, then wouldn't it be at least 

administratively odd to apply the continuous workday rule 

immediately to exclude some walking time that follows 

that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think so. I think it

is perfectly sensible and a clear bright-line rule, 

Justice Souter, to say that when you arrive at the actual 

place where you perform, not just any activities, and not 

just the activities that are integral and indispensable to 

your working activities, but to the principal activities 

for which you're hired -- and, admittedly, there can be 

more than one of those, but that doesn't -- you know, 

donning and doffing is not a principal activity --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So, you're saying that --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- of anyone who's cutting beef.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- so-called "integral 

activities" are not principal activities.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. They don't have to 

principal activities. They're better understood as --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They felt otherwise.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Phillips, I -- the 

Steiner opinion explicitly agreed with the lower court in 

that case, which said that the term "principal activity or 

activities" embraces all activities that are integral and 

indispensable.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And if -- if you think that 

putting on the clothes fall within that, then that covers 

walking, too --

MR. PHILLIPS: It --

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- after that.

 MR. PHILLIPS: The problem with that analysis is 

that the court was only analyzing section 4(a)(2) for 

these purposes. And what it was saying is, "We are 

prepared to accept that there are certain activities that 

are either preliminary or postliminary, and then there are 

others that are primary activities. And if you are 

integral and indispensable to a primary activity, it is a 

compensable event."

 Recognizing that Steiner is probably the most 

extraordinarily extreme facts that you could imagine, 

because we're talking about clothings that had -- clothing 

that had to be changed in order to protect the public --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Phillips --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- health and safety.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you're asking us to 

interpret the same words, "principal activity or 

activities," differently in sub (2) that was at issue in 

Steiner, and in sub (1), and then the clause that follows 

both of those. The same phrase is used. So if "principal 

activity" includes donning or doffing, under sub (2), why 

wouldn't the same follow for sub (1) and the following 

clauses?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Because you have to read the 

language "principal activity or activities" in (a)(1)

within the context of what Congress was trying to achieve 

by the Portal-to-Portal Act, which was to absolutely and 

categorically exclude walking time from being part of 

mandatorily compensated activities of a particular 

employee.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it is included if it's --

once the workday begins, if there's a rotation, you walk 

from one station to the other. That walking time, I think 

it's conceded, would be included.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, if your date -- if the 

principal activity is donning and doffing, then the 

walking time thereafter would also be included.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But, Justice Ginsburg, if you 

step back and think about this language in the context of 

the words that are written here, it says, "walking to and 

from the actual place of performance of the principal 

activity." No one would think that that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: "Or activities."

 MR. PHILLIPS: Or activities. But, again, 

Justice Souter, all that suggests is that there are times 

when somebody who's working in a clothing operation may --

you know, may spend time distributing the cloth or may 

spend time actually sewing the cloth. Those are two 

separate activities. They're different activities. But

it doesn't mean -- and it certainly doesn't convert 

anything that had -- can be described as "integral and 

indispensable" into a primary activity which such employee 

is employed to perform. No employee, in these cases, was 

employed to perform the act of putting on clothes or the 

act of picking up equipment.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What do you think about the 

possibility, "it depends on the clothes and depends on the 

equipment," so that, in Steiner and here, it's a lot of 

protective gear, it's really quite part of the job and 

special and unusual. In Mt. Clemens, it's a kind of 

uniform. It's just washing your hands up, putting on an 

apron. So, where it's minor putting on clothes, as 

someone might in his house, doesn't come in substantial, 

doesn't come in integral and indispensable; but where it's 

quite a big deal, it does. And who decides? The agency.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are two parts about 

that that are worth focusing on. One is, I don't think 

you can lump the two cases together, because the clothing 

or the equipment that has to be put on with respect to the 

Barber Foods company is barely -- is quite minimal and, 

indeed, was deemed to be diminimus. So, I'm not -- I'm not 

sure you can lump the two cases together in that way.

 But also, in terms of where the Secretary comes 

out on this, let's not forget 79.7(g), footnote 49, which

is, candidly, the clearest statement from the Secretary 

with respect to, What do you do when you have donning and 

doffing that is followed by walking time? And what does 

the -- and what does the regulation specifically say? And 

that's on, I think, 92 and 93 of the appendix to our 

petition. It specifically says that that walking time is 

not excluded, not necessarily --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not necessarily excluded. It's 

really noncommittal on the point.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, except that, under their 

theory of this case, it is always excluded. Always. So 

that whatever else you can say about the meaning of that 

particular language, the interpretation the Secretary 

offers to you today flatly rejects --

JUSTICE BREYER: But "in certain" --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- that language.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- that footnote -- that's 

where I actually got the idea -- it says, "We reserve, in 

certain situations." To me, that meant sometimes it can 

be a major big deal to don clothing -- protective gear; 

sometimes it isn't -- an apron. And whose job is it? Now 

I'm repeating myself.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The Secretary's.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, but -- and if we were talking

about that in the context of other kinds of activities --

if you're back in the (a)(2) world of looking at whether 

something's preliminary or postliminary, I have less of a 

problem with dealing with that. The problem is, here 

we're talking about (a)(1) activities, the core of what 

Congress enacted the Portal-to-Portal Act to protect 

employers for.

 The Portal-to-Portal Act is not a statute that 

remotely provides protections for the employees. This is 

a statute that was designed to protect employers from 

billions of dollars of liability. And so, when you're 

talking about, "Under what circumstances can you ignore 

the flat prohibition on requiring walking time to be 

regarded as a mandatory subject of compensation?" then it 

seems to me the distinction you're proposing doesn't work.

 And it's also, Justice Breyer, again, flatly 

inconsistent. Their -- that's not their theory of the 

case. Their theory of the case is, "If we can describe it 

as in any way integral and indispensable to some other 

activity, that makes it a primary activity, that starts 

the workday, and everything after that then becomes 

compensable."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Phillips, can I call your 

attention to the text of Section 254(a)? It's in the red 

brief in the Alvarez case, at App. 1. What it -- what it

says is that you don't have to pay overtime compensation 

or minimum wages for and on account of any of the following 

activities: (1) "walking, riding," blah, blah, blah. This 

is (1).

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- for the "place of 

performance of the principal activity or activities which 

such employee is employed to perform."

 MR. PHILLIPS: Now you skipped over "actual 

place," there --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Okay.

 MR. PHILLIPS: -- Justice Scalia, but -- which I 

think is an important --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. PHILLIPS: -- word.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: (2) "activities which are 

preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity 

or activities."

 You're trying to sever (1) and (2), when the 

text itself joins them. The activities referred to in (2) 

are "said principal activity or activities." The "said" 

refers to the ones that are in (1).

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: How can we possibly sever (1) 

and (2) and say that for purposes of one, it means one

thing; for purposes of two, it means something else?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Because when the court was 

interpreting (a)(2) in Steiner, it wasn't interpreting 

(a)(2) to determine whether something was a postliminary 

activity in connection with "said preliminary 

-- primary activities." What it was saying is, these are 

not preliminary and postliminary activities, that they are 

excluded from that. And so, the court's really coming up 

with what is a third category of cases, which deals with 

integral and indispensable activities to a primary 

activity. They didn't have to analyze it as a primary 

activity. All they had to say was, it's not -- that the 

preliminary and postliminary activities are not simply 

temporal, that there is a substantive component to it.

 And that is essentially the holding of the court 

in Steiner. It says there's a substantive component; and, 

therefore, we're not going to just simply look in -- time-

wise, whether it comes before or after principal 

activities. We're going to decide that there are some --

there are some situations that are so important that they 

need to be compensated under (a)(2), because they don't 

fall within preliminary or postliminary language.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Phillips, it says it 

-- either something is before, preliminary; or after, 

postliminary. And if it's neither of those, then, it

seems to me, it fits -- it's not before the principal 

activity, and it's not after the principal activity, so 

what else is it, other than the --

MR. PHILLIPS: It's work --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- principal activity?

 MR. PHILLIPS: -- that's mandatorily compensable 

under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Remember, the Fair 

Labor Standards Act, under this Court's interpretations 

from Mt. Clemens Pottery and the cases that preceded it, I 

mean, it -- you know, it had a very sweeping definition of 

what is work within the meaning -- within the meaning of 

what is compensable as minimum wages and as overtime. And 

that's in place.

 And now Congress has stepped in and said, "Well, 

wait a second. When we did it -- when that got 

interpreted that broadly, we're talking about $6 billion 

in liability." So, it's very important, given that we're 

talking about fairly minimal activities on the -- on the 

-- that are involved here, triggering potentially massive 

liabilities. And so, what we've done is, we've excluded 

from those massive liabilities the walking, riding, and 

traveling time, because that's the basis on which you end 

up with big numbers.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, your approach 

introduces, really, a third concept. You have the

principal activities and you have -- either preliminary or 

postliminary -- and now you've got a third concept: 

integral. But the statute -- that's nowhere in the 

statute.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, I mean, that -- but 

that's -- this Court's decision in Steiner was the one 

that reached out to decide that "integral and 

indispensable" was a category of activities that were 

going to be compensable, even though, on the face of them, 

they may have appeared to be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, unless they were 

saying those activities were, in fact, principal 

activities. If it's integral, if it's embraced by the 

principal activity, it is a principal activity, and that 

at least is more consistent with the statute in keeping it 

in two categories rather than inventing a third.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't think that creates 

any particular problem, but what you end up doing, Mr. 

Chief Justice, under those circumstances, is, you 

completely eliminate the protection that Congress meant to 

provide here for walking, riding, and traveling time, 

which is -- which is a vital consideration --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how does -- how 

does your analysis apply? Let's say these employees had 

to change their equipment several times during the course

of the day.

 MR. PHILLIPS: You mean after they've --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, I mean, the --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- arrived at the actual place --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the equipment is only 

good for, you know, an hour, two hours, then they have to 

get new ones. They have to walk back to the place --

MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- they have to doff the 

other equipment, don new equipment, and walk back. 

Wouldn't your analysis say that that walking time is 

excluded?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No. No. Once you --


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why not?


 MR. PHILLIPS: We don't have any quarrel with


the argument that once you, for the first time, arrive at 

your actual place of performing the principal activity for 

which you were hired, which is cutting beef or whatever it 

happens to be in your hypothetical -- once you arrive 

there, that does begin the workday. That's the definition 

of what starts the workday, which is why I -- to our mind, 

this is a much clearer and brighter-line rule. We can 

tell you precisely when you start the workday. It's when 

you get to the place where you got hired to work, and 

start to do that work.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But do you have compensated 

activities that do not begin the workday?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, you do have compensated --

and that's true for lots of different situations, Justice 

Kennedy. You could have a situation where you go home, 

and you get called back in on an emergency, and nobody 

disputes that that's clearly compensable time, and nobody 

has ever seriously argued that you ought to extend the 

workday --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What happens with the 

microchip or a laboratory with highly contagious viruses 

where there's got to be two hours of scrubbing and then 

there's a walk? What do you do with that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: If the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Two hours of scrubbing --

MR. PHILLIPS: You know, it's -- it's very 

possible that the scrubbing will be regarded as an 

integral and indispensable part of the -- of the -- of the 

employment, and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But then there's -- but then 

there's --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- therefore, it's compensable.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but then there's a walk. 

What about the walk?

 MR. PHILLIPS: The walk is not compensable,

because Congress didn't want you to have walking until you 

got to the actual place where you would perform the 

services. And nobody's principal activity as an employee 

is to go take a shower or to go and pick up certain types 

of clothing. That's not --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But the problem --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- the understanding of 

"principal activity."

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Phillips, the problem I 

continue to have is that I thought Steiner embraced, 

explicitly, the notion that principal activity embraces 

all activities that are integral and indispensable. You 

take issue with that, but do you want us to overrule 

Steiner --

MR. PHILLIPS: No.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- or make some changes in 

it? I just don't understand.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I want you to limit Steiner to 

the very unusual facts that arose in that particular 

context. I -- we don't have any quarrel with the 

"indispensable and integral" test as a reason for 

beginning -- as a reason for compensating certain 

activities.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was --

MR. PHILLIPS: What we do --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- so unusual about the 

facts --

MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was so unusual 

about the facts in Steiner? They're pretty common.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, I -- the notion that if 

you didn't shower and change, you would expose not only 

yourself, but your family and everybody else to the risks 

of lead poisoning is a pretty extraordinary --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, but the --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- circumstance.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the routine where you 

have to don, you know, safety equipment, and you have to 

shower when you're done, whether it's being -- the 

meatpacking or the stuff at Steiner -- that's a pretty 

common occurrence.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, well, I would -- I would 

argue that you could make a -- you could make a claim that 

none of that donning and doffing ought to be compensable. 

And, candidly, we've made that argument. But, 

unfortunately, the court didn't grant the petition on that 

particular -- on that particular question. So, we have to 

take it as a given. But I don't -- I don't -- I -- for 

exactly the reason you identify, Mr. Chief Justice, that 

does create a problem. I mean, part of this problem is a

bit contrived. I don't think that the ordinary donning 

and doffing ought to trigger the beginning of the workday. 

But, assuming that it does --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you're saying --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- I still don't think -- I'm 

sorry, Justice Souter.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, no, I didn't mean --

finish.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But I still don't think that, 

even if you accept that that is compensable conduct within 

the meaning of Steiner, which I -- that's what it's 

talking about -- but Steiner, Justice O'Connor, doesn't 

say anything about the fact that there was going to have 

to be walking or traveling, or the workday. The court, in 

Steiner, clearly had in mind the workplace, where you're 

producing batteries. There's a lot of language in that 

opinion that says, "This is where you really do the work. 

That's your battery, and here's where you're going to get 

-- engage in activities that we think you need to be 

compensated." But the court never remotely suggested that 

you were entitled to the walking time between those two.

 And, if you go back to 790.7(g), that language 

specifically told every employer that simply because you 

have to pay for certain kinds of activities at the outset, 

because they're integral and indispensable, as decided by

a court, that doesn't necessarily mean you have to pay for 

all the walking time. And so, you've got to come up with 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You would say that's --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- a theory that supports that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- so for all activities that 

are -- that are integral and indispensable? What about 

sharpening tools?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, sharpening tools is the 

easiest one, because you do that right on your workplace. 

I mean, that's exactly what Congress had in mind in its 

legislative history --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, no.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But your --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that's -- but suppose --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- but your time shouldn't 

start from then. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that's not the 

hypothetical. Suppose you sharpen the tools outside, by 

your locker, and then you -- then you go for a 10-minute 

walk to get to the -- and you carry the sharpened tool?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, again, if the Court decided 

that sharpening the tools, even though it's done not at 

the same time, which is what Congress had in mind when it 

-- when it identified that hypothetical -- but, even if

you assume that, that that's integral and indispensable, 

it still isn't what triggers the time for starting the 

actual employment.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but isn't your -- in the 

answer that you just gave, and an answer which you have, 

in fact, consistently repeated, inconsistent with Steiner 

-- Steiner didn't say there is a separate category of 

integral activities. Steiner said that activities which 

are integral are part of the principal activity. And 

isn't your argument premised on denying that identity?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I can accept that identity 

for purposes of distinguishing between what's preliminary 

and postliminary activity. What I cannot do is to -- is 

embrace that for purposes of deciding when walking 

time/traveling time ought to be included. Congress was as 

plain as it could humanly be in saying that, "We're not 

going to allow walking and traveling time to be included 

in an unexpected fashion." And that is precisely -- as 

the Chamber of Commerce brief says, that is precisely what 

we're talking about here.

 And, candidly, as Judge Boudin said in his 

concurring opinion, the circumstances arising in this 

context bear a very eery resemblance to the situation that 

gave rise to the Portal-to-Portal Act in the first place. 

And so -- and I think it's important to put this into

context. You know, the language of the statute, as I read 

it, clearly is in our favor. The purpose of the statute 

is clearly in our favor. And then the question is, Did 

this Court, in a decision that dealt solely with 4(a)(2), 

mean to vastly change the scope of 4(a)(1) in a way that 

would dramatically expose employers to liability --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- why is it so dramatic, if 

we recognize that nothing begins until the donning and 

doffing -- that is, the travel to wherever you don and 

doff? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: None of that is included, 

even from the plant gate to the place where you don and 

doff.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But the -- well, in part, because 

plants are not -- have never been designed -- remember, 

we've got 79.6 -- the Secretary of Labor told employers 

for 50 years, "You can set up your plant without fearing 

that you're going to suddenly be hit with walking time 

after somebody engages in donning and doffing, even if it 

turns out to be integral and indispensable." For 50 

years, they followed that advice. They set up all of 

their plants with that expectation. And now this Court,

if it follows the ninth circuit's lead, will suddenly say, 

"Okay, what you need to go out and find is all of the 

integral and indispensable activities" -- not just donning 

and doffing -- any integral and indispensable activity 

that you can get a court to buy into, that will start this 

ever-expanding workday, such that any walking that goes on 

after that and before you get done with all of these ever-

expanding post-doffing activities. Then you have the --

that's -- you know, so you have this broad -- and that's 

why you're going to have these -- substantially greater 

and totally unexpected liabilities on the workplace.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is that advice contained, 

that you say was given to --

MR. PHILLIPS: 790.7(g), footnote 49, and it 

says, as --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- plain as day --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- not necessarily.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but -- there -- there, it 

means always. Always.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you say that they operated 

on the assumption that it meant never.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I'm prepared to --

notice that, although it did not, necessarily, it might.

where you have to walk and feed the dog in the morning before 

you show up at work. So --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- they're not saying 

only --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- the Secretary does. I don't 

know whether the plaintiffs necessarily do. And certainly 

the plaintiffs in those cases didn't. They took the 

position that the workday started as soon as you engaged 

in protecting the canines, just as in -- insurance 

industry, they -- the insurance adjusters are all taking 

the position that as soon as they have to get on the 

computer, that's an integral and indispensable part of 

their day, and everything after that, including traveling 

and movement, are all part and parcel of what gets added 

in there.

 What I'm suggesting to you is that once you go 

down this path and you say, "Okay, we're going to define

the workday by reference to whatever somebody determines 

is integral and indispensable," you are going to have an 

expandable workday, and that if you are really looking for 

a fairly clear rule, you sit -- you stick with what the 

language of the statute says, which is, the actual place 

of the performance of the activity for which you were 

hired. Once you've got that in place -- that's not to say 

that's the full length of when you get compensated. You 

can be compensated for activities outside of that workday. 

Happens every day, when you have to come in for an 

emergency or if you have to come in --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: My problem with your argument 

is Steiner.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I understand the problem with 

Steiner, Justice Kennedy, but I think it is inappropriate 

to read Steiner, which says, point-blank, "Our holding 

does not deal with conduct that is specifically excluded 

by 4(a)(1)," and then -- and ignore that. That whole --

that statement of the holding of the court seems to me to 

say, "All we're telling you the answer to" --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, it doesn't.

 MR. PHILLIPS: -- "is 4(a)(2)." 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The only thing specifically 

included in (a)(1) is walking, riding, or traveling to and 

from the actual place of performance of the principal

activity or activities. And once you assume that 

"principal activity or activities" includes everything 

that's integral and essential to principal activities, 

(a)(1) doesn't cover it.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, you can get to the logic of 

that. The question is, Is it appropriate to apply the 

"integral and indispensable" test, which is an atextual 

standard, in a way that essentially guts 4(a)(1) and the 

fundamentally important values that it was designed to 

serve? And what I'm suggesting to you is, that's a 

mistake. And we know that, because the regs protected us 

against this precise event. It is exactly what the 

Portal-to-Portal Act was designed to accomplish, and it's 

the better interpretation of this particular statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, may I just ask 

you a preliminary question about the IBM case -- IP -- IBP 

MR. PHILLIPS: IBP.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- IBP case? As I understand 

it, whatever we do here is irrelevant to what the bottom 

line is going to be in that case, because the 

determination is going to be made only under State law. 

The court below said that's what it was going to do. And 

the employees are not objecting. So, it seems that that 

case, as distinguished from Tum, is really not anything

that this Court should decide, because it would be

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, they don't argue that it's 

moot. And it's not purely academic. There are collateral 

consequences to deciding what the Federal law issue is in 

this particular context. We briefed this issue at the cert 

stage at some length, and the court granted cert, so I'm 

assuming that, in some respects, you, sort of, pass by 

that particular problem.

 There are collateral consequences. And the 

other side, again, doesn't say it's -- that it has mooted 

this case; it simply says that there's this serious issue 

on remand as to precisely how it'll all play out.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Could you give us a collateral 

consequence? I mean that is --

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, because it -- reas judicata 

collateral estoppel effects from the ruling that we've --

that we have violated federal law, both that might be 

available to the Secretary of Labor and otherwise.

 If there are no further questions, I'll reserve 

the --

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 As the previous questioning suggests, the 

outcome of this case follows directly from Steiner. The 

Portal Act, by its terms, applies only to activities that 

occur before the commencement of -- before the 

commencement of, or after the conclusion of, the 

employees' principal activities. Steiner holds that 

donning and doffing, such as in this case, is "part of" --

that's a quote -- the employees' principal activities, and 

it, therefore, follows that the Portal Act applies only to 

activities either prior to, or after, that donning and 

doffing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But why isn't walking from the 

gate of the -- of the factory to the -- to the place where 

you're on the assembly line, why isn't that integral and 

essential to the performing of the activities?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Because -- and this is the 

language that Mr. Phillips is referring to in Steiner --

4(a)(1) itself makes clear that a walk will not be the 

first principal activity, including on the theory that 

it's integral and indispensable. The first principal 

activity has to be something other than a walk, and that's 

what happens in this case. As in Steiner, there is

donning at the beginning of the day. That's part of the 

principal activities --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, but if -- once you 

accept the theory that the principal activity includes 

those things that are integral, you can say walking from 

the gate of the plant to the assembly line is part of the 

principal activity. Now, walking to the gate may not be 

part of the -- may not be part of the principal activity, 

but -- I --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Two reasons, Justice Scalia. 

The first is the one that I gave, and that is, the Steiner 

Court concluded that -- and that was the end of the 

sentence, where it said, "except as excluded by 4(a)(1)," 

that Congress made clear in 4(a)(1) -- that the initial 

walk wouldn't be the first principal activity. Second, 

the walk won't be integral and indispensable. The test 

for whether or not something is integral and indispensable 

is whether it's work that's required and closely related 

to the productive activities. And simply walking to the 

donning station is not. That's in contradistinction to 

putting on the clothes that are required here, required as 

a matter of law in order to do your job. That's the line 

that the statute draws.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what about the dog 

grooming cases?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The dog cases, Justice Kennedy 

-- and I -- let me make sure we're -- I have your 

hypothetical, and that is, the police officer at home 

grooms the dog --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- then comes into the office. 

That is part of their principal activities. The 

subsequent commute is not compensable, on the ground that 

it is a break and a commute. That's covered by the Fair 

Labor Standards Act. The Portal Act is concerned with 

something else -- that is, before the beginning and after 

the end of your day. The dog cases are, of course, also 

entirely different from this one. You have -- you have 

arrived at the place of the performance of your principal 

activity. Steiner said that occurred, quote/unquote, "on 

or off the production floor." And so, you're at the 

plant, and your workday has started.

 Justice Scalia, you made the point, and I simply 

want to reinforce it, that the reference in -- to 

"principal activities" in 4(a)(2) is the same as the 

reference to "principal activities" in 4(a)(1), but it's 

also the reference to principal activities in the 

concluding clause of section 4.

 If I could just take the Court to that. The 

statute is obviously reproduced in a variety of places,

but it's also at page 3 of our brief. 

And so, after 4(a)(1) and 4(a)(2), there's this 

concluding clause, and the text frames the workday. And 

it says that the Portal Act, 4(a)(1) and (2), will apply 

to activities which occur -- I'm quoting now -- "which 

occur either prior to the time on any particular workday 

at which such employee commences, or subsequent to the 

time on any particular workday at which he ceases, such 

principal activity or activities." And it simply follows, 

as a matter of the plain text, that when Steiner held that 

those activities, "such principal activities," include the 

donning and the doffing, that everything that happens 

between those two events is not encompassed by the Portal 

Act.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What if -- what if --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- answer to Justice 

Kennedy said that the dog cases were distinguishable 

because there was a break in the principal activity. So, 

if we were to rule in your favor, all the employer has to 

do is make sure that the donning and doffing station's far 

enough away from the production line so that there will be 

a sufficient break between the two activities.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, the -- both the donning 

and the doffing and the walking in between and the wait

for the equipment, which is the bulk of the time in all 

these cases, would be compensable. The Department of 

Labor has regulations --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you mean "it 

would be" -- that's my question.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes. I'm sorry, Mr. Chief 

Justice. There -- the donning and doffing in the Alvarez 

case, by and large, happens in one place: in a locker 

room. In the Tum case, by contrast, the employees show up 

at a cage, they wait for things, they walk, they pick up 

something else, they wait, they pick up something else. 

And so, there's a body of time that I refer to as the 

donning and doffing process. All of that would clearly be 

compensable, even in your hypothetical. Your hypothetical 

would address the final piece of time, and that is, you 

get your last piece of clothing on, and you have to go to 

the floor, and the employer could say, "Take a 15 minute 

break," in there. I suppose that's hypothetically 

possible. I think the reason it doesn't happen in these 

cases and in the other cases I've studied is that the 

employer has an incentive, when they're forced to 

compensate, to do things efficiently.

 What happens is, the employer will say, "All 

right, your shift is going to start at 6:30 in the 

morning; therefore, you can clock in and start donning at 

34

6:23." That's a 7-minute window, and that forces the 

employees to do everything efficiently. They don't insert 

artificial breaks.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but why -- if you're 

talking about efficiency, it may well be that the 

employees, instead of imposing upon the employer the costs 

of moving the donning and doffing location closer to the 

-- to the place where the real work is being done, they 

might prefer, instead, to get a slight salary increase per 

hour. But -- and that is -- that is possible, under the 

petitioner's scheme, because it is left to private 

negotiation; whereas, what you say is that they must pay 

for that. They must pay for that walk from the donning 

and doffing. They cannot negotiate out of it, because if 

it's in the Fair Labor Standards Act, it is mandatory.

 So I -- don't talk to us about efficiency. It 

seems to me that the efficiency arguments are on the other 

side. Leave it to the private sector. The employers --

the employees can decide what they care more about.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Scalia, I -- all I 

have in -- before me that I can rely on is the statute 

that Congress enacted. Your point would cover, of course, 

equally, the donning and doffing in Steiner itself. 

Congress made some choices about things that were going to 

be compensable. It's worth noting that Congress drew a

line about whether -- in terms of whether there was a 

collective bargaining agreement involved, because under 

section 203(o) of the statute, in workplaces covered by a 

collective bargaining agreement, you can negotiate out of 

at least clothes changing.

 But I think within the framework of the statute 

that we do have, I am actually quite correct, and that is, 

right now, today, the employers have no incentive to adopt 

an efficient scheme for arranging donning and doffing. 

They can put things in different buildings if they like. 

The employees here are required to spend 10 or 20 minutes 

waiting for different clothing at different times, 

depending on how long the lines are. It is a workable 

scheme that Congress designed that said, "We're going to 

have a workday." And the employer is in charge of 

deciding when the workday begins or ends, but, during that 

workday, they're going to have to pay.

 I did want to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein, I just wanted 

to have a clear answer to the question Justice Scalia 

asked you. Is it so that collective bargaining could not 

trade off the compensation for the walking and the donning 

and doffing for some other benefit that the employees 

might prefer?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Ginsburg, it is an

unsettled question, is the answer. I will give you the 

best answer I can. 203(o) allows for the negotiation away 

of clothes changing time. The question whether clothes-

changing time includes safety equipment is a matter in 

dispute. The ninth circuit held that it didn't. This 

Court denied certiorari on that question.

 The further question, if you did negotiate away 

the clothes changing time, whether that would negotiate 

away the walking and waiting time has not been confronted 

by a court, so far as I am aware. It might be said to 

logically follow, but it hasn't been decided. It's not 

presented by this case, because cert was denied. And so, 

I haven't thought very much --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you say it's an open 

question.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It is. I'm confident it's an 

open question.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Could --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- about what gear qualifies? 

That is, here we have no dispute that this is protective 

gear. But it's not any changing that counts. So, how do 

we know whether this is the kind of donning and doffing 

that's compensated in -- or the kind that isn't?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The line that has been drawn by

the Department of Labor, is where I will start, and the 

Department of Labor -- and let me give you some citations 

-- says that the line is between whether the employer 

requires you to do the donning and doffing on the plant or 

not. The citations for that are section 785.24(c) of the 

regulations, 790, note 65. And then it contrasts clothes-

changing that's by your own choice, in 790.7(g). I think 

that's a sensible line, but it's not presented by this 

case.

 Justice Breyer, it goes to your characterization 

of the final sentence of footnote 49, and that is: 

sometimes.

 The reason I think it's sensible to draw the 

line that the Department has in required clothes changing 

is that the employer will only require you to do it onsite 

if it is truly integral and indispensable to your job; 

otherwise, it'll be optional, or they'll let you do it at 

JUSTICE BREYER: Can I ask you about a -- the 

other part of the case? I mean, I think, as I've 

suggested, most of these things are up to the agency. 

They're minor things in law, so -- but it seems well 

established in the agency reg, as well as in Skidmore, the 

famous line about waiting being, "Are you waiting to be 

engaged, or are you engaged to wait?" So, assuming that

this is just putting on and off clothes that are essential 

-- so, assume you win on that part -- when they wait to 

put on the clothes, you would think -- if it's like an 

airport, sometimes you wait; if you're lucky, you don't. 

Well, under those circumstances, you wouldn't be engaged 

to wait. You're waiting to put on the clothes, not -- you 

know, etcetera -- so, why would you win on that part?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Can I, again, make sure I have 

the hypothetical in terms -- we are, in a sense, talking 

about the first wait. You show up at the first --

JUSTICE BREYER: The -- what happens -- you win 

on the --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- clothes. They're protected 

gear. That's the assumption. That's part of the job. 

The workday begins. But you have to get there, and you 

wait to get the clothes. On that --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: But --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- one, why not Skidmore? Why 

not the reg? And, if so, why don't you lose on that one?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: You are -- in that situation, 

you're waiting for the very first piece of equipment. In 

the Tum case, you show up at the cage at the beginning of 

the day. You are engaged to wait. The regulatory 

citations are two: 790.6(b) and 790.7(h). There's also a

case that's confronted this, which is the Metzler case, 

127 F.3d 959. All those authorities make clear that if 

the employer tells you, "Show up to do something, show up 

here to put on your clothes," and, because of the way the 

employer has designed the system, you have to wait, 

through no fault of your own --

JUSTICE BREYER: But suppose sometimes you have 

to wait? Sometimes it's a minute, sometimes it's nothing. 

Is it like an airport? Or does the employer here say, 

"You must show up seven minutes early, because there'll be 

a wait"?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's the -- it would be the same 

result whether the employer puts a time on it or not. The 

employer says -- I'll give you an example we could agree 

on, when it's a time --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that what the reg says?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The reg doesn't --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's surprising I didn't see 

that in the reg, if it says that.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The regulation gives this 

example, which I think is on point, and that is, if you 

are told to show up for when the production begins -- the 

meat's going to come across -- and the machine breaks down 

or they simply don't start sending the meat until five 

minutes later, the fact is that you get compensated,

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought you would say that 

the whole principle of, you know, "Are you engaged to

principle that was adopted in Steiner. I mean, are you 

putting -- are you employed to put on your -- to put on 

your clothes, or are you putting on your clothes to do 

your work? And Steiner essentially repudiates that. So, 

you know, let's forget about Skidmore.

Justice Breyer is testing a very particular piece of time.

it commence when you get in line or when you --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- first get the piece of 

clothes? It's a fair question. The other side hasn't 

made any argument that it doesn't include the first wait, 

I think, because you're told that you have to don, it's 

part of your principal activity.

 Let me also say, this, I think, is a somewhat 

academic question when it comes to -- and nothing against 

academics, but the -- it's a somewhat academic question 

when it comes to actual workplaces, because what happens 

is what I described before, the employers, under employers 

that are following our rule, do set up a time clock, and 

they say, "Show up at 6:23, and that's when you can clock 

in." They have computerized swipe cards, and the computer 

won't recognize them until 6:23. And it's the time after 

that that will be compensable. So, if the Court were to 

say the donning and doffing process starts and ends the 

workday for purposes of the Portal Act, everyone will 

understand what the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That wasn't decided below, 

was it? It was just a question of walking and waiting, 

and they weren't specific about whether that included 

waiting or walking, predonning.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right. The reason for

that is, there isn't a predonning wait in the Alvarez 

case, where the plaintiffs won, and the Tum plaintiffs 

lost on an unrelated theory that the actual donning and 

doffing couldn't start the workday.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, perhaps we shouldn't 

reach a question that hasn't been aired and decided below.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: And my formulation, which is 

simply the donning and doffing process, would, in fact, 

leave the -- to the lower courts the question of precisely 

when donning begins and doffing ends. That's a fair point.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Goldstein, since you 

display such respect for the agency here --

[Laughter.] 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- what do you do about the 

agency's footnote that flatly contradicts your theory of 

the case, and which says that the mere fact that donning 

and doffing may require compensation does not necessarily 

mean that travel between the clothes changing place and 

the actual place of performance would be excluded?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, my answer, I 

think, is that -- you had it right in the first half hour, 

and that is, that phrase --

[Laughter.] 

MR. GOLDSTEIN: -- "not necessarily," can mean 

one of two things; i.e., we're denying that it follows a

fortiori, or we're simply not deciding the question.

 The agency itself, which -- the Secretary wrote 

this guidance -- the agency explains that it meant that 

we're simply not deciding it. That's actually perfectly 

intelligible and a correct understanding of the history. 

Remember, the Portal Act gets enacted, and, right 

afterwards, the Secretary issues this guidance that then 

gets put in the CFR. This was their first reaction to the 

Act. Subsequently, after several years, these are -- what 

you're referring to is something in the -- what are known 

as the Part 790 guidance. Later on, the Secretary issued 

what's called the Part 785 guidance. And, in 785.3, it 

said, anything that, in 785, contradicts 790, controls. 

And 785.38 is the relevant citation. And there they say, 

"If you show up at the beginning of the day and you're 

given instructions, or you show up at the beginning of the 

day and you get a set of tools, what follows after that, 

in terms of travel time, is compensable."

 Can I answer two -- make two other very quick 

points? Justice Ginsburg, you asked about mootness. I 

would refer you to the Deposit Guarantee case, 445 U.S. 

326, which talks about collateral estoppel effects. There 

is ongoing litigation against this defendant on this 

question, a case called Chavez, in the district court.

estop them is the restatement section of judgments, 

section --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I wasn't questioning that, so 

much as it is -- it is extraordinary for this Court to 

take a case when the bottom line is going to be the same. 

And, since we have the identical issues, with no such 

preliminary question in Tum, if we decide in your favor in 

the Tum case, then the other case is taken care of.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's true, you could dig the 

case. My only point is that it is not moot. And perhaps 

the variety of workplaces shown in the two cases would 

illustrate things for the lower courts. I suspect that 

may have been why the Court granted cert.

 I also wanted to respond to the suggestion that 

this is a surprise to industry, with just a couple of 

citations. Walking and waiting time has been held 

compensable since at least 1961. The Mitchell case, 286 

F.2d 721, the Barrentine case, 750 F.2d 47. There was a 

meatpacking plant at least seven years ago, 127 F.3d 959. 

And this has been the agency's enforcement position at 

least since the late 1980s. It's sufficiently settled 

that the court of appeals here held that IBP's failure to 

pay for this time was a willful violation of the statute.

 If there are no further questions.

 Mr. Gornstein.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

 MR. GORNSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

The Portal Act excludes walking time from 

compensation only when it occurs outside the workday, 

before an employee commences, or after he ceases, his 

principal activities. And Steiner held that the term 

"principal activities" includes activities that are an 

integral and indispensable part of the principal 

activities. It follows that when donning and doffing are 

integral and indispensable parts of the principal 

activities of the employees, then walking that occurs 

after donning, and before doffing, occurs within the 

workday, and it is not excluded from compensation by the 

Portal Act.

 Now, the employers in these cases have argued 

that the term "principal activities" does not encompass 

activities that are integral and indispensable parts 

thereof, and that Steiner did not so hold. But, at the 

very outset of its opinion, the Court, in Steiner, posed 

the question presented as whether changing clothes and 

showering are compensable as part of the employee's 

46

principal activities, and had answered that question 

several pages later by stating that it agreed with the 

conclusion of the court of appeals in that case that the 

term "principal activities" includes activities that are 

an integral and indispensable part of the principal 

activities, and that the activities in question in that 

case fit within that description.

 Now, that was the only textual basis on which 

the Court could have reached the conclusion that it did, 

because, if the only principal activities in that case had 

occurred on the production floor, then the changing of 

clothes at the beginning of the day, and the showering at 

the end of the day, necessarily would have been 

preliminary to and postliminary to said principal 

activities, and thereby expressly excluded from 

compensation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if I think that opinion 

was just flatly wrong, that Congress, when it referred to 

the "principal activity or activities," was talking about 

the cutting of the meat or whatever the employer hired the 

person to do? He didn't hire him to put on clothes. What 

if I think that? Why do I have to extend what I think to 

be an erroneous decision beyond its narrow holding?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: Justice Scalia, we are not 

asking for an extension of what you would regard as an

erroneous holding. All we're saying is that you read the 

term "principal activities" as the Court interpreted it in 

Steiner. Once you do that, and you plug it into the 

statute, the plain language of the statute takes over, 

because it says that walking is only excluded when it 

comes before the employee commences, or after he ceases, 

the principal activities. Once you plug "integral and 

indispensable" into that sentence, as Steiner requires, 

then you are -- the plain language of the statute tells 

you that that time is not -- is compensable when it occurs 

after donning and before doffing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why can't I say that Steiner 

requires that interpretation of what constitutes a 

"principal activity" only for purposes of determining what 

is compensable, and that when we -- when we come to 

examine the separate question, of when the workday begins, 

we can -- we can apply, as far as precedent is concerned, 

a different interpretation of what is a "principal 

activity"?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: Because the term "principal 

activity," I believe, as, you yourself, pointed out, is 

listed in the first -- at (a)(1). That's the first place 

it appears. Everywhere else it appears, including in 

(a)(2) and in the concluding sentence, it says "said 

principal activities." So, the statute itself tells you

that the term "principal activities" has to mean the same 

thing everywhere it appears. And since you have already 

interpreted that term, in Steiner, to include "integral 

and indispensable activities," that terminology has to 

appear everywhere in the statute.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Gornstein, do you 

agree that just because it's a compensable activity 

doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't going to be a 

break in the workday? People have talked about the dog 

example, and there are others. I mean, and -- so, all 

you're talking about is the determination that this is a 

principal activity. It seems that there's a separate --

second question, which is, How do we tell if the space in 

time between two different principal activities, and 

they're two very different types of activities, is a break 

or part of the continuous workday?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, first of all, that 

question arises not under the Portal Act, which only 

applies before the principal activities begin and after 

they end, but under the Fair Labor Standards Act, itself. 

And that question would be governed by the Court's prior 

decisions on what constitutes hours worked, together with 

the Department of Labor's regulations that address what 

constitute hours worked. And -- within the workday -- and 

what the Department of Labor has said is, generally,

everything within the workday is compensable, except for a 

meal period and except for a time period where there is a 

break that is so substantial that the employees can 

effectively use that time for their own purposes. And so, 

it says things like 5- to 20-minute breaks are not periods 

where the employee is not working, but they are resting 

for the further work. That is common in the industry. 

And so, that would be an issue that would arise when you 

had a break that was much longer than that, probably at 

least a half hour, where you can actually effectively use 

that time for your own purposes and are not required, 

essentially, to stay around on the employer's premises and 

to wait or rest to begin your work anew. So --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I take it you then agree that 

the answer for which you argue here follows not merely 

from the text of 4(a), but the text of 4(a) plus a 

continuous -- some variety of a continuous workday rule.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You've got to have both.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: That you -- that you have to 

have a work under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and 

then you have to have the exclusion from that not apply.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: The issue here, the exclusion 

doesn't apply, and nobody has raised the question about

whether this is hours worked under the Fair Labor 

Standards Act. But clearly it is, under the Court's 

decisions.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you don't -- but you don't 

get the answer from simply the text itself.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Did you say --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Gornstein, what about in 

the Tum case, the walking and waiting before the donning 

of the clothes?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: Yes. On the -- on the waiting 

before the clothes, there's -- there are two series of 

waits: the first wait and then later waits. As to the 

later waits, once you decide that the donning begins the 

process of principal activities --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I'm talking about the --

MR. GORNSTEIN: The initial wait.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- these. The initial.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: The initial wait --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: You don't think that's 

covered.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: We do think that's covered. And 

under -- the Department of Labor's approach is to treat a 

required wait for an activity as an integral part of that 

activity. So, if that activity is, itself, compensable as

a principal activity, then the required wait for that 

would also be --

JUSTICE BREYER: But the word --

MR. GORNSTEIN: -- compensable as part of that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- "required" is what I didn't 

understand in that. My airline example, what's required?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: What the -- the Department 

distinguishes --

JUSTICE BREYER: "Required" is -- sometimes 

there's a wait, sometimes there's not a wait. Is that 

required?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, if the employee is simply 

voluntarily arriving earlier than --

JUSTICE BREYER: He has to --

MR. GORNSTEIN: -- he has to and wait --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- put on his uniform. And 

sometimes there's a wait, sometimes there's --

MR. GORNSTEIN: When --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- not a wait.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: If --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that a required -- or not? 

And, if it is, where does it say that in the regs?

 MR. GORNSTEIN: It's a required wait anytime, in 

order to get to the production floor on time, the employee 

has to be at the donning station in a sufficient period of

time to get there, and if there's a wait at that time, 

then he's being required to wait.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein acknowledged 

that that issue, the predonning wait, was not decided 

below.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: I'm not sure I view that the --

the question as not having been decided below. And the 

Court also did grant certiorari on waiting time.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it wasn't, obviously, 

decided in the first circuit, because they ruled against 

the employee's position.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: But they said "a reasonable 

period of time for waiting" is non-compensable. And that, 

at least as a general rule, is not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- but the question 

of when -- what waiting are we talking about? Before the 

principal activity or only after? That specific issue, as 

I understand it, was not aired below.

 MR. GORNSTEIN: Well, I'm -- my memory, at 

least, of the court of appeals opinion, is that it was 

saying that the wait before the donning was not 

compensable, because it was a preliminary activity. But I 

-- if you've read it differently, then that may be --

JUSTICE BREYER: Do we have to decide the second 

question? I think it's actually quite difficult. I can

can be, and should be, resolved, in our view. But if the 

Court doesn't want to resolve that issue, that's fine.

curious about. With all the trouble of various 

interpretations and famous footnote 49 --

MR. GORNSTEIN: 49.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- why, in all these years, 

hasn't the Department of Labor gotten rid of it?

 [Laughter.] 

MR. GORNSTEIN: It should have. Because even at 

the time it was written, that reservation was in tension 

or not in conflict with the plain language of the 

regulations. And certainly by the time of Steiner, it was 

clear that this kind of time was compensable.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

Gornstein.

 Mr. Phillips, you have four minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I 

just have a couple of points I'd like to make.

 First, Justice Breyer, I want to start with the 

waiting times. I didn't actually have an opportunity to 

spend much time talking about them. But I think the 

answer that the Solicitor General's Office has offered 

with respect to the waiting time simply illustrates the 

expandable nature of the workday. Their position --

Justice Ginsburg -- or, no Justice O'Connor specifically asked 

that question, "You're not saying that waiting time prior 

to engaging in a primary activity, in fact, starts the 

workday." And the answer is, absolutely, it does, because

they find that everything that is integral and 

indispensable triggers the start of the workday. So, to put 

it into fairly graphic terms. If you have to show up in 

order to put on a coat in order to go onto the floor in 

order to do your services, then the waiting time for that 

coat counts. If, however, you also have to put in 

earplugs in order to get to the place where you have to 

get the coat, not only do putting in the earplugs count, 

under that theory, but, if you have to wait, you have 

that, and that extends the workday, and all of the walking 

in between there. 

So, if you're asking, "Is this going to become a 

significant liability?" the answer is clearly yes. For 

very significant compensable acts -- and, indeed, in this 

context, some of those compensable acts were found by the 

jury to be utterly diminimus -- you're going to end up 

with significant waiting time, and you're going to end up 

with significant walking time.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Was the predonning waiting 

issue decided below?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, Justice O'Connor, they 

specifically held that all of the waiting time is not --

it is to be excluded. And they did that on the basis of 

790.7(g), before you get to the footnote -- because that's 

the tag to the footnote -- as to what is -- what is the

ordinary meaning of wait -- of preliminary and 

postliminary for waiting time? And the expectation is 

that if you're waiting to get your check, and if you're 

waiting to check in, the recognition is that those --

those are completely fortuitous, just as it is here. 

There's nobody who structured this arrangement so that you 

will end up spending time waiting. Indeed, the scheme is 

designed to get people in as efficiently --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They decided --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- as possible.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- no waiting time. They 

didn't decide "if" waiting time -- "which" waiting time. 

But they said no -- it's irrelevant whether it's before or 

after, because waiting time isn't covered. So, I don't 

see how they specifically decided, yes, waiting time is 

covered, but not --.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, 

if they specifically decide that there is no waiting time 

that's covered here, and the plaintiffs have sought 

compensation for both pre- and post-waiting time, then the 

issue is squarely posed, and they've certainly posed it in 

their petition, and the Court granted it. So, again, 

obviously, you're free to decline to decide issues, but it 

seems to me that one is posed.

 I want to --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it seems the court 

below said waiting time isn't covered, so we're not going 

to engage in any debate about what -- if waiting time is -

- were covered, which waiting time?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but that just goes to the 

question -- I think it disposes of the issue of, if you 

have waiting time that otherwise looks to be fairly 

ordinary preliminary/postliminary activity, it, 

nevertheless, can be converted into primary activity under 

their interpretation of the statute. And they clearly 

suggest that the answer is yes. Our suggestion is, that's 

inconsistent with the way waiting time is handled under 

the regulations; and, therefore, the answer clearly should 

be no. And, at a minimum, the Court ought to affirm that 

part of the Tum decision.

 With respect to the holding of Steiner -- I 

mean, it's important to put in mind, Steiner -- one of the 

things -- two things that Steiner focused on -- it focused 

on section 3.0, and it recognized that there are going to 

be situations where you're going to be able to bargain 

away clothes changing. And so, now you're in a situation 

where, for some -- for -- in some circumstances, because 

you've bargained away compensation for clothes changing, 

walking that takes place before or after that will never 

be compensable; in other situations, it will be

compensable. That's an absurd outcome in a situation 

where Congress clearly had one thing in mind that it 

absolutely wanted to accomplish, and that was to ensure 

that walking, riding, traveling to the place where you 

actually perform the services for which you've been hired, 

has been -- has -- is excluded from being mandatorily 

compensated -- Steiner doesn't deal with 4(a)(1); the 

language is as plain as it can be -- are not -- you know, 

unless specifically excluded by section 4(a)(1).

 Thank you, Your Honors.
