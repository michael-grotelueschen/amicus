 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in MedImmune, Incorporated, versus 

Genentech.

 Mr. Kester. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. KESTER 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. KESTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

As of this morning, it is exactly 70 years ago 

to the day, minus 4 months, that this Court heard argument 

challenging the new Federal Declaratory Judgment Act of 

1934, in an action to construe an insurance contract. 

And exactly 25 years -- 25 days later, in a 

unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice Hughes, joined 

by Justices Stone, Brandeis, and others, the Act was held 

fully consistent with Article III of the Constitution.

 This morning, you are here because an action was 

brought for a declaratory judgment that a biomedical 

manufacturer need not play -- pay large sums, under a 

license as patent royalties, under a patent it contends is 

invalid, unenforceable, and not infringed, but is paying 

royalties under protest in the meantime. That complaint 

was ordered dismissed by the Federal Circuit as outside

the Article III judicial power of the United States.

 In detail, the Petitioner, MedImmune, is a 

biotech company, formed in 1988. During the 1990s --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kester, would it --

MR. KESTER: Yes?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- would it -- would 

your position be different if the contract contained a 

specific -- the license -- a specific provision specifying 

that the licensee may not sue? 

MR. KESTER: No, it would not, Your Honor, 

because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- do you think such 

a provision would be enforceable? 

MR. KESTER: I doubt it would be enforceable. 

It would be a matter -- under the Lear case, Lear against 

Adkins, it would be an -- it would be an affirmative 

defense if such -- if such a claim were raised. This case 

is here at the level of subject-matter jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me, I don't -- I don't 

understand what you just said. You mean, it would be 

enforceable; that if such a suit were brought, the 

licensor could raise that contractual provision as a basis 

for dismissing the suit. Is that --

MR. KESTER: Under 12- -- under 12(b)(6) --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

MR. KESTER: -- perhaps. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, then it is enforceable. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but --

MR. KESTER: No.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- your point is, it's not 

jurisdictional. 

MR. KESTER: It's not jurisdictional, exactly, 

Justice Souter. This is a jurisdictional ruling. And 

that's all that this Court granted certiorari on.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but as a matter of 

policy, we, at some point, either in this case or some 

later case, may have to address the question of whether or 

not such a provision is enforceable. If it is, we may be 

-- not be talking about much. It's just going to be 

boilerplate in every license agreement, and that's the end 

of it. And it --

MR. KESTER: And so --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but it -- on the other 

hand, it may be that there are reasons not to enforce 

this, so that we don't have courts flooded with lawsuits, 

et cetera, et cetera.

 MR. KESTER: And those reasons, I would suggest, 

Justice Kennedy, were taken care of in Lear, for the most 

part, in 1969. Provisions in license contracts that 

prevent challenges to the contracts are not enforceable

under the patent laws of the United States. But then, I 

-- as I was saying, that is a matter of patent law. 

That's not a matter of jurisdictional law. We're here --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's look at what 

might be a matter of jurisdictional law. I take it, from 

your position, there's nothing preventing Genentech from 

suing, either, is there? In other words, to establish the 

validity of their patent. 

MR. KESTER: It has -- it has happened, on 

various occasions, that patentees have brought suit to 

establish the validity of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Against licensees? 

MR. KESTER: Against licensees and others. And 

the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Against licensees who are not 

claiming that the patent is invalid? And where is the 

controversy? 

MR. KESTER: The controversy could arise in any 

number of ways. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I mean, I can see, if the --

if licensee says the patent is invalid, that the patentee 

says paying its royalties -- how does it --

MR. KESTER: The patentee could be paying his 

royalties. The patentee could also be putting ads in the 

paper saying, "This is not a valid patent." It could --

it could have acquired a lot of publicity. And, in the 

end, there could be reasons, and there have been such 

cases -- which we cited, 47 of, our brief -- where such 

suits have been brought. But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If it -- if the -- if the --

if the licensee came into court and said, "I'm not 

contesting this patent," that would be the end of it, 

wouldn't it? 

MR. KESTER: If the licensee said, "I am not 

contesting that patent," that could be. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, but the patentee 

would just say, "Look, we have a license. I think the 

patent's valid, and you owe me a dollar a unit." The 

licensee said, "Well, I don't think they're -- it's valid, 

so I owe you nothing." And they settle on a license for 

50 cents. Why can't the patentee say, "You know, if I get 

a judicial decision establishing that the patent is valid, 

I can charge a higher license, either when this agreement 

expires or for other licenses"? 

MR. KESTER: That -- I agree with that, Mr. 

Chief Justice. But the practicality is that a patentee 

starts out with, essentially, a judgment that the patent 

is valid. There is a presumption of validity. And to 

challenge that patent -- that presumption of validity, is 

a very difficult undertaking. Most of them don't bother.

Why would they? If they are receiving -- if they're 

receiving --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm trying to see how 

far you want -- are willing to push your argument that 

just because there's been an agreement, or perhaps even a 

settlement, that that somehow or another doesn't moot the 

controversy, the underlying legal dispute. And it -- I 

gather your answer to me is that Genentech, or a patentee, 

can sue, even though they have an existing -- they're 

getting royalties from the licensee, they can still sue 

the licensee. 

MR. KESTER: A settlement does not deprive a 

Federal Court of subject-matter jurisdiction. That's the 

narrow point that is before this -- before this Court. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why aren't you -- you said, 

"The only question before the court is jurisdictional." 

If that's so, why isn't your position that the Federal 

Circuit put the wrong label on this, that license is 

listed in 8(c) as an affirmative defense; so, whatever the 

outcome should be, the wrong label should -- is -- was 

used. It shouldn't be a subject-matter jurisdiction, 

shouldn't be 12(b)(1); it should be an 8(c) affirmative 

defense. And then the -- you're out of the jurisdiction 

box, but you're left with the same underlying question. 

MR. KESTER: But not the same underlying

question, Justice Ginsburg, with respect, because then you 

are in a situation like the business forms case in the 

Seventh Circuit, which came out shortly after the Lear. 

There was a settle -- settlement, and the -- and it was 

argued that the settlement was not effective because of 

the Lear decision, and parties can't settle themselves out 

of the Lear decision. But that is all under 12(b)(6), and 

not 12(b)(1). This case involves a 12(b)(1) motion, not a 

12(b)(6) --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what --

MR. KESTER: -- motion.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- good would it do? Suppose 

we said, "Federal Circuit, you put the wrong label on it. 

It should be 12(b)(6), not 12(b)(1), or perhaps even 8(c), 

affirmative defense"? Then you go back to the Federal 

Circuit, and they'll come up with the same decision, that, 

as long as you are licensed and are paying your royalties, 

you have -- and they just put a different label on it --

you have --

MR. KESTER: They --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- you have no -- you have 

not stated a claim. 

MR. KESTER: That would be effectively 

overruling Lear, which is what, I think, is what many of 

the parties in this case actually seek to do.

Lear does not allow inhibitions of challenges to 

patent licenses. A licensee can challenge the validity, 

the enforceability of the patent. That's because there's 

a public interest in this, as well.  Parties cannot simply 

contract with each other and prevent a challenge to a --

to a patent --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then --

MR. KESTER: -- license. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the Federal Circuit 

distinguished Lear, and said what -- in Lear, the licensee 

had stopped paying royalties. Isn't that so? 

MR. KESTER: That -- those were the facts of 

Lear. But -- it happened that way in Lear, but that 

wasn't the reasoning of Lear. Lear would not totally 

cover that situation, but we would submit to this Court, 

it shouldn't make any difference. The reasoning of Lear 

is the same. The licensee cannot, by contract, be 

estopped, licensee estoppel, from challenging a patent. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, there's no way, I --

under your view, that a patent holder can protect itself 

from suit through any license arrangement or any agreement 

of any kind. 

MR. KESTER: I suspect there are many ways, Mr. 

Chief Justice, but not by throwing them out on a 

jurisdictional basis at the very first moment of the

lawsuit.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How about --

MR. KESTER: There may be ways this could be 

arranged at the second level, through --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what are those ways --

I mean, the ones that have been mentioned as possibilities 

in the Government brief -- one, you rejected, and the 

other that was mentioned was: if you sue -- if the 

licensee sues, then the royalty fees will be upped. Would 

that be effective? 

MR. KESTER: That is a question that would arise 

under Lear against Adkins. And the question before this 

Court in that situation, if it got to this Court, would 

be, Is that kind of a provision compatible with the policy 

that was so firmly expressed by Justice Harlan in Lear, 

and has been reiterated in so many subsequent cases of 

this Court? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, you have rejected both of 

the Government's suggestions on what the patent holder 

might do to protect itself. Do you have anything concrete 

that you would concede the patent holder could do? 

MR. KESTER: I don't think that I have rejected 

both the Government's suggestions. I've said that they 

raise problems on -- as to the scope of Lear.

are talking about a jurisdictional defense or whether we 

are talking about an affirmative defense, assuming 

jurisdiction, is there any -- is there any reason for us 

to accept your position, other than the reason that you 

have mentioned a number of times, and that is the adoption 

and encouragement of a public policy that allows patent 

challenges freely? Is that the nub of our reasoning, if 

we were to support your position, either jurisdictionally, 

in this case, or in recognizing -- or the -- in dealing 

with the affirmative defense in another case?

 MR. KESTER: Not quite, Justice Souter. I would 

say the nub of your position is the Altvater case, the 

Aetna case, the Maryland --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Altvater is difficult for 

you, isn't it? Because there was an injunction in 

Altvater, wasn't there?

 MR. KESTER: That -- but that -- but was --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Which raises an entirely 

different policy issue? 

MR. KESTER: Well, I would say what it -- what 

it raises is simply an extra fact, but it wasn't a 

necessary fact. Because this Court, in Altvater, 

specifically pointed out that even if there weren't an 

injunction there, there would be -- there would be the 

danger forced on the licensee, of an infringement suit;

and an infringement suit means, possibly, an injunction of 

the patent, treble damages, any number of sanctions. An 

injunction suit can put a company out of business, 

especially like a company like my client here. And --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that is -- that is a good 

reason. And, I take it, it's your logic that that is a 

good reason to recognize a fairly broad right on the part 

of the licensee to challenge.

 MR. KESTER: Right.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, the nub of your 

position, as I understand it, is the public policy that 

favors relative --

MR. KESTER: It --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- freedom to challenge --

MR. KESTER: It's more -- it's more than public 

policy, it's Article III. Article III says that you can 

bring a lawsuit in this situation. And that was settled --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No --

MR. KESTER: -- in Aetna. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I realize that. But, I 

mean, what we've got in this case, and in any of these 

cases, is a question of line-drawing under Article III. 

And your argument is, you want to draw the line where you 

want it drawn primarily because there are practical 

reasons to favor a public policy of free challenge.

MR. KESTER: What we are presenting in this case 

is a dispute about money. It's not abstract. It's not 

hypothetical. It's not conjectural. It is concrete, 

immediate. All the facts are in. It's definitely 

adversarial. It's legal. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You -- well, you can have such 

a dispute on a theoretical question between, I don't know, 

the ACLU and the National Rifle Association, but that 

doesn't create a case or controversy. What is the injury, 

the imminent injury to your -- to your client that is the 

basis for the case or controversy?

 MR. KESTER: The --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is it anything other than, "I 

have to pay the royalties that I agreed to pay."?

 MR. KESTER: It is the -- it is that, "I am 

having to pay the royalties -- that I say I did not agree 

to pay, because this is an invalid patent." Money is 

being paid by my client every quarter, large amounts of 

money. That is a major injury.

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you're speaking as 

though somehow that -- such a contract is contrary to 

public policy, and void. 

MR. KESTER: No, we're saying that that isn't 

what we agreed to. We're saying this is a contract 

dispute. And the whole purpose of the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then why are you 

paying it, if you -- if you don't think you owe it? 

MR. KESTER: Because the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Because of the threat of 

treble damages --

MR. KESTER: The threat --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and injunction.

 MR. KESTER: -- of this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If we're trying to 

figure out where the public policy is here, why don't we 

give some weight to those congressional enactments that 

obviously fortify the strength of the patent? In other 

words, Congress passed these provisions providing for 

treble damages for attorneys' fees. And --

MR. KESTER: But --

there's got to be a public policy to counterbalance that,

Congress can always do that, if it wants; but it didn't --

it thinks that you need these provisions to protect the 

patent holders. 

MR. KESTER: But, Mr. Chief Justice, 

Congress can also amend the Declaratory Judgment Act, if 

it wants. And Congress was proud of the Declaratory 

Judgment Act when it was passed in 1934. And the 

legislative history of it -- and nothing in the text is 

contrary, says the purpose of this is so that contracts 

can be resolved without breach, and judicial 

determinations can be had. It's like a noninvasive, a 

less invasive kind of surgery. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kester, may I ask you this 

question? Is it your view that Gen-Probe represented a 

change in the law? 

MR. KESTER: Absolutely. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Were there -- before Gen-Probe 

was decided, were there any cases, like this case, that 

were decided? 

MR. KESTER: There were many, Your Honor, and 

they were decided --

licensee brought suit challenging validity while the 

license was still in full --

 MR. KESTER: We had suits in the Third Circuit, 

the Seventh Circuit, the Second Circuit, and even in the 

Federal Circuit, in its early days, where it quoted those 

cases which said, "It is not necessary for the licensee to 

stop paying payments in order for Article III to be 

satisfied."

 This case came as a shock in 2004. And, in 

fact, the judges below, in this series of cases, all said, 

"We thought it was settled law the other way." All this 

case represents, from our point of view, is, "Let's go 

back to the way it has always been."

 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

we'll go on." Then they can sue again, I take it.

 MS. MAYNARD:: In that situation. Recognizing 

that's not the situation we have here --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can they settle that, by 

the way? Is it all right to settle it, or is -- that 

interfere with the policy that patents have to be open to 

challenge? 

MS. MAYNARD: May I -- if I can answer the first 

question first. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Either one.

 MS. MAYNARD: If there were to be a settlement, 

in the second case, the -- it would not be an Article III 

case or controversy problem with the second case. And 

that suit should not be dismissed under 12(b)(1).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay.

 MS. MAYNARD: The -- in that case, the patent 

holder might have a valid 12(b)(6) defense, and the suit, 

laying aside enforceability issues that you raised, may be 

easily resolved, on that ground. But, in terms of the 

question before the Court today, that wouldn't be an 

Article III matter. 

I think, as a policy matter -- so, moving off

the question before the Court right now -- as a policy 

matter, the -- it's not clear from this Court's cases 

exactly what types of agreements would be enforceable. I 

think there's a spectrum of cases one can imagine, ranging 

from Pope -- the type of promise that was extracted in 

Pope, which this Court held was unenforceable --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think you 

overread Pope. All Pope said was that they're not going 

to grant specific performance. In fact, they've said, 

"Whatever you may think of the policy here, we don't --

specific performance calls on the equitable discretion, 

and we're not going to do it." But, I don't read Pope as 

holding that the clauses are otherwise unenforceable. In 

MS. MAYNARD: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- other words you're 

maybe entitled to damages. And that may be measured by 

the license fee that you agreed to pay. 

MS. MAYNARD: Well, there certainly would be a 

question, though, the way that Lear read Pope, and under 

Lear, about whether a bare agreement not to challenge 

licenses, especially ones like in Pope, where they agreed 

not to challenge the license, even beyond the term, would 

be enforceable. And the Government thinks there's a 

spectrum. One -- at one end of the spectrum would be

licenses like those in Pope, and at the other end of the 

spectrum would be a consent decree entered after 

settlement of a bona fide patent infringement suit where 

the -- which included an agreement not to settle. Now, 

that's clearly not what we have here. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, is -- if -- I guess there 

are three possible positions on the question of whether a 

licensee can attack a contract, a patent where he has a 

license and wants to keep the contract. One, he can never 

do it. Two, he can always do it. Three, it depends on 

what the contract says. Now, do any of those questions 

have anything to do with the question before us, which is 

whether it is a case or controversy?

 MS. MAYNARD: No, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If we were to reach 

the question, which is very interesting, "What is the 

Government's position as to which of those three positions 

is the right position?" -- were we to reach it -- I agree 

with you, I don't see it in front of us; but maybe it is 

-- if it were, what would be your view? 

MS. MAYNARD: The Government's view is that 

there's a spectrum along the spectrum, and it would have 

-- you would have to consider each case on its terms. And 

it's not clear, from this Court's cases, where the 

policies in that --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, basically, 

though, you're not certain. The Government's view would 

be, it is a matter as to whether you can sue claiming the 

patent is invalid, whether the licensee can do it, that 

probably -- but you're not certain, and you haven't made 

up your mind definitely, because it is not in this case --

but you think it's going to be something they could 

regulate themselves by contract. 

MS. MAYNARD: It's certainly not foreclosed by 

this Court's precedent, and it's an open question where 

the policies -- how they would weigh out. There's no 

language in this license, however, suggesting any type of 

settlement. And, moreover, I think it's important to 

recognize that the parties here actually have a concrete 

dispute about what the licensing agreement means. Count 

one in the complaint is asking for a declaration --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you don't think 

that matters, though, do you? I mean, even if they all 

agree there's no dispute about what the license agreement 

means, your position is still the same, right? There is 

an Article III controversy because they challenge the 

validity of the patent? 

MS. MAYNARD: If the parties have a concrete 

dispute about the validity of the patent, and it would 

affect their rights and obligations in the way that it

would here -- in other words, that money will no longer be 

due to the Respondents if the patent's invalid --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is --

MS. MAYNARD: -- and the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that always the case? 

I mean, could -- can you enforce a license agreement based 

on an invalid patent? You thought it was valid -- parties 

had a dispute about it -- whether it is valid. You 

entered into agreement, say, "Well, let's split the 

difference. We'll -- you know, 50 cents rather than a 

dollar or nothing." It's determined that the patent is 

invalid. Can the patentee then still say, "Well, you 

still owe me the money. We've, kind of, cut -- split the 

difference. That was part of the agreement"? 

MS. MAYNARD: It might depend on whether there 

was consideration beyond the patent itself. In the -- in 

this -- in this case, though, the Petitioner claims that 

if the -- if the patent is invalid, they no longer owe 

licensing fees, and, under Lear, they would be entitled to 

the licensing fees, that they've paid since they began 

challenging, back. So, it's clear that under either the 

contract or a question of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Contractually? They say that 

that's their contractual right? 

MS. MAYNARD: They claim that, under the

licensing agreement, they only owe royalties on valid 

claims. That's count one of the complaint, in the (j) --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does that appear in the 

licensing agreement? Or --

MS. MAYNARD: Where does it appear in the 

licensing agreement? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, I took them as just 

asserting a general proposition of law -- that, where 

they've agreed to pay royalties because of a patent, if 

the patent is invalid, they don't have to pay royalties --

not because there's some special provision in this 

contract.

 MS. MAYNARD: The parties actually have a 

concrete dispute about the meaning of the licensing 

agreement in that regard, Justice Scalia. On page 399 of 

the joint appendix is the provision about which they have 

a dispute. And the language in there provides that they 

will pay on substances which would, if not licensed under 

this agreement, infringe one or more claims of either or 

both of the Shamir patents, or coexpression patents, which 

have neither expired nor been held invalid by a court or 

other body of competent jurisdiction. There was similar 

language in --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So, there's really not much at 

issue in this case. And that's clearly a case of

controversy, isn't it? There is a dispute over the 

meaning of that provision of the agreement. 

MS. MAYNARD: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, there's less here than 

meets the eye. 

MS. MAYNARD: That's what the Government 

believes, Your Honor.

 It's also -- the licensee also does not need to 

breach the licensing agreement in order to create a case 

or controversy. The licensee is currently paying 

royalties that it does not believe it owes and that it 

believes it would be entitled to have back if it should 

prevail on its interpretation of the -- of the patent and 

the licensing agreement. It doesn't have to make that 

injury more severe by breaching. That's clear from this 

Court's decision in Altvater. In Altvater, royalties were 

being demanded and royalties were being paid, but, 

nevertheless, this Court held --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that -- it's 

been pointed out that was pursuant to an injunction. 

MS. MAYNARD: Yes, it was pursuant to 

injunction, but that was not important to the Court's 

reasoning. What the Court said is, "You need not suffer 

patent damages in order to bring the suit." Not a 

contempt. "You need not breach the injunction and put

yourself at risk of treble damages for infringement." It 

was the patent damages that put the licensee at risk, and 

that's the same risk that the Petitioner faces here and 

should not have to bear in order to bring suit. 

The case or controversy is whether or not the --

they owe the royalties. The whole point of the 

Declaratory Judgment Act was to allow contracting parties 

not to have to sever their ongoing contractual relations 

in order to get disputes resolved between --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think --

MS. MAYNARD: -- themselves.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think there would 

be a case or controversy if Genentech were suing to 

establish the validity of its patent? 

MS. MAYNARD: In the situation that we have 

here, Your Honor? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes.

 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, I do. Where the Petitioner 

claims that the patent is invalid, that they could -- that 

the Petitioner's claims unsettles their right, damages 

their property value, potentially, and that they could 

bring a declaratory judgment action of validity. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And what would their -- what 

would their concrete injury be? What is the threatened 

imminent injury that they would assert in that -- in that

action?

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, right now --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You have a licensee who's 

paying the license fees. What is their concrete injury? 

MS. MAYNARD: It -- from the moment -- the 

Petitioner has an argument that from the moment it ceased 

-- it starts claiming that the patent is invalid and pays 

under protest, that it is entitled to those royalties 

back.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But --

MS. MAYNARD: The --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- so long as they're still 

paying the royalties, isn't that sort of an abstract 

disagreement? I mean, it's sort of like the ACLU saying 

that the patent's invalid. You know, it's a nice 

theoretical question that we can argue about, but as long 

as they're paying the royalties, where's the concrete 

injury? 

MS. MAYNARD: Well, I think, technically, 

Justice Scalia, they probably have a claim for patent 

infringement, to which the defense, as Justice Ginsburg --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I --

MS. MAYNARD: -- points out --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I find it --

MS. MAYNARD: You -- may I answer that question? 

You need not have a mirror-image suit, in that sense, 

Justice Scalia. And Altvater makes that clear. In 

Altvater, the patentee's claim was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's fine.

 MS. MAYNARD: -- much narrower than the 

counterclaim; and, nevertheless, the Court allowed that 

counterclaim to proceed.

MS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

I'd like to start with the fact that there are 

four counts in the complaint for declaratory relief. The 

first one is styled as a -- contractual relations claims. 

The other three are styled as patent law claims. And it's 

important to emphasize, at the outset, that this Court, in 

Skelly Oil, in Calderone, and in, really, all of the 

cases, has said it's very important to look behind the 

labels that a Declaratory Judgment Act plaintiff puts on 

their claims. We need to actually see what is the cause 

of action they're trying to adjudicate so we can do an 

accurate assessment of justiciability -- standing, 

ripeness, Federal-question jurisdiction.

 I want to start by explaining why there is no 

contract claim at issue here. You heard today, they're 

trying to salvage this, say that there's a contract 

dispute, a dispute about the terms of the contract. They 

didn't argue that below, and with good reason. And I'd 

just point you to the briefs in the Federal Circuit. 

Roman numeral I, which is all about the improper dismissal 

of the Declaratory Judgment Act claims, refers to the fact 

these are, quote, "patent-law claims," end quote, at page 

27. Nowhere do they say that there is a dispute about the 

proper interpretation of the contract terms. And let me

explain why. 

The contract terms, which were just read to you, 

is Section 110 of -- 1.10 at JA-399 of the license -- says 

that there is an obligation to pay royalties for Synagis 

on any claim -- not any valid claim, any claim -- that has 

not been held invalid by a court or other competent 

jurisdiction from which no appeal has, or may, be taken. 

Now, they never said, below, "That clause means that we 

can come to court and have the court decide whether this 

patent is valid, and, depending on whether we win or not, 

then we can stop paying." And the reason they didn't make 

that argument is, it was rejected by this Court a hundred 

years ago, in United States versus Harvey Steel. Very 

similar clause. The United States says, "This means that 

we don't have to pay if the patent is invalid." And, in 

an opinion by Justice Holmes, this Court rejected it out 

of hand by -- and said, "This was a conventional proviso. 

We don't even need to look to evidence of the party's 

intent, because this is the standard proviso. It does not 

mean" -- and they said it was a "twisted interpretation" 

that the Government was offering -- it doesn't mean that 

the licensee, quote, "thought the patent bad and would 

like to have the Court say so now," end quote. Yet that 

is exactly --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that a case about Article

III case or controversy? 

MS. MAHONEY: It is, in the following sense, 

Your Honor. They can't just show up here today and say, 

"Well, there really is a dispute about the contract." But 

they never argued, below, and is foreclosed --

JUSTICE BREYER: Shouldn't we send that back? I 

mean, I thought we were here to decide one question, that 

the Federal Circuit has said that, "Unless there is a 

reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit, you can't bring a 

declaratory judgment action, because of the Constitution 

of the United States." Now, I have to admit, I've looked 

up, or I've had my law clerk look up, probably now 

hundreds of cases, and we can't find, in any case, such a 

requirement. Indeed, the very purpose -- as I -- we've 

just heard the SG say, of this act, the Declaratory 

Judgment Act, seems to be to allow people who -- a 

contract -- who are in a real concrete disagreement, to 

get a declaratory judgment without getting rid of the 

contract. But I might be wrong about that. 

But you've now argued a different point.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, isn't the right thing for 

us to do, to decide the issue in front of us and then send 

it back? If you're right that they have to pay, whether 

they win or lose; if they're right that they promise not

to sue; if you're right on 14 other grounds, you might 

win. But should we decide those grounds today? Why? 

MS. MAHONEY: Well, first of all, with respect 

to this issue, whether there would be jurisdiction over a 

real live contract dispute, they never argued it, Your 

Honor. It's not part of this case. The Federal Circuit 

didn't address it, because they didn't argue it, because 

it's foreclosed by --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question --

MS. MAHONEY: -- a precedent a hundred --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The question that is 

presented to us -- whatever they suggested at this oral 

argument that wasn't in III, the question it presented to 

us is, Was the Federal Circuit right when they said, "You 

have no access to a declaratory judgment unless there is a 

reasonable apprehension that you will be sued"?

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, that is the right --

that is the right starting point for a test, depending on 

the cause of action they're seeking to adjudicate. In 

here, what the Federal Circuit properly understood is that 

they are seeking to adjudicate affirmative defenses to an 

infringement action under the patent laws. 

And, just like in Steffel, if you're trying to 

adjudicate, on an anticipatory basis, an enforcement 

action, you have to show that you would reasonably fear

that enforcement action. And, in fact, Steffel uses that 

language, and Poe versus Ullman dismisses a case for 

failure to establish a genuine fear of prosecution. But 

then, you have to go one step beyond, and that is to say, 

Are they -- is the cause of action not ripening because 

the declaratory judgment plaintiff is forfeiting their 

legal rights in order to avoid some very severe harm that 

would be cognizable coercion? That's the test that's used 

in Steffel for -- in essence, being able to test a --

defenses to a cause of action that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And why --

MS. MAHONEY: -- an enforcement action.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- doesn't that work here? 

MS. MAHONEY: It doesn't work here, for several 

reasons. Most fundamentally, this is a settlement. I 

mean, Mr. Steffel did not enter into a settlement or a 

compromise with the prosecutor. He wasn't complying 

because he was under an agreement to do so. Here, it has 

been settled for -- forever, that if a -- an agreement --

if you're making payments pursuant to an agreement, in the 

nature of a compromise, you can't come and say that it's 

been coerced or it's a form of duress.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why should we accept the 

characterization that it's a compromise? As I -- and

maybe I'm just factually wrong here? I thought, at the 

time they entered into the license agreement, they had 

some disagreements about the scope of the then-patent, the 

scope of the anticipated patent, and so on, and they 

couldn't very well be resolved. But they were -- they 

were not settling, in the -- in the classic sense of the 

word, a -- let us say, a focus claim, one against the 

other. 

MS. MAHONEY: I think the answer, Your Honor, 

is, they weren't settling, for all time, in the sense that 

they could never get out of the deal. Certainly, they 

could repudiate and then go ahead and sue. But yet, at 

page 3 of their petition, they expressly say, the reason 

they entered into this agreement was in order to avoid the 

costs and risks of litigation. It is the reason --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But had they gotten to the 

point, prior to the execution of the contract, in which 

one party was saying, "You may not do this," and the other 

party was saying, "Oh, yes I can," so that there -- there 

was a focus controversy that would have been the subject 

matter of a conventional lawsuit, then and there, had 

there not been this license agreement? 

MS. MAHONEY: Not exactly, but what they did was 

they headed it off at the pass. They understood that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But the question is, How far

ahead of the pass can they get and still call it a 

settlement?" in the sense that you're using that term.

 MS. MAHONEY: It's a compromise. It's a 

compromise of the very claims they're trying to adjudicate 

here. What they want to adjudicate are affirmative 

defenses to a patent infringement action. That is not a 

ripe claim, and there is not sufficient immediacy, because 

they are preventing that claim from ripening by continuing 

to make voluntary payments --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But --

MS. MAHONEY: -- under their --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you --

MS. MAHONEY: -- agreement. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Right. But you were saying 

that the status of that agreement, for purposes of the 

jurisdictional question here, is exactly the same as the 

status of an agreement that they might have entered into 

after one party had brought suit against the other. And 

MS. MAHONEY: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And they -- they had settled. 

And then, later on, somebody wanted to repudiate the 

settlement.

 MS. MAHONEY: I don't know if it's exactly the 

status. For instance, in a settlement after litigation

has been filed, I think that Lear would say that you can't 

even repudiate that. But certainly -- so, there might be 

some differences -- but from --

JUSTICE SOUTER: In any event --

MS. MAHONEY: -- the standpoint of coercion --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- it's equivalent to a 

settlement after a formal demand has been made.

 MS. MAHONEY: It is equivalent to that, in the 

following sense. They understood that if they -- if they 

didn't get a license, that they would be exposed to 

Genentech's claims under the -- under the infringement 

laws. And in order to avoid that exposure, even though 

they had all the information they needed to assess the 

validity of this patent at the time --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose they didn't have all 

the information. Suppose you enter into a license 

agreement -- you're convinced, as the one that's going to 

pay the license fee, that it's a good patent -- after the 

agreement's signed, the technological advances, other 

disclosures, indicate that the patent is deficient. Could 

you sue then? 

MS. MAHONEY: No, I don't think so, unless --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but then -- so then, the 

argument that you've made is just not --

MS. MAHONEY: No, I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- relevant for us, the fact 

that they knew everything --

MS. MAHONEY: They did.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it also means that this 

isn't really a settlement, in any respect. 

MS. MAHONEY: It's a compromise of claims that 

could be brought. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Mahoney, can I ask this 

question? Supposing at the time they negotiate the 

license agreement there's some uncertainty about whether 

the patent is valid or not. So, at the end of the license 

agreement -- they agree on the royalties, the term, and 

the -- everything it covers, but they put in a provision 

and say, "We're not entirely sure the patent is valid, so 

we reserve the right to bring an action challenging the 

validity of the patent. We will pay royalties in the 

meantime, and the -- you will accept these royalties as 

sufficient for the use of the patent, that, if we win, you 

don't have to pay royals, if we lose, you do." Would that 

be a valid provision? 

MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, but that would 

certainly be a closer case if there --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But would it --

MS. MAHONEY: But I --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- not be precisely the same

issue as a jurisdictional matter as to whether there's a 

case or controversy? 

MS. MAHONEY: No, I don't think so, because the 

real issue, in terms of Steffel, is whether you can say 

that the party is being coerced. And, at least in your 

hypothetical, you could say that they have --

JUSTICE STEVENS: He's not being coerced, but 

he's bargaining a little better royalty rate than he'll --

otherwise would have to pay. 

MS. MAHONEY: Well, in terms of whether they're 

-- if the parties expressly agreed that that was part of 

their deal, then you at least wouldn't say that there was 

an issue of coercion. But here, that isn't what happened. 

Instead, they used --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm really asking --

MS. MAHONEY: -- a standard proviso --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- whether the parties could 

agree to create a case or controversy.

 MS. MAHONEY: I think probably not, Your Honor.

Stevens' hypothetical? Assume it, take it as given. They 

did put that in. I know you think they didn't, but I want 

to assume it.

 MS. MAHONEY: Uh-huh.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I'd like to also assume --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I have a review of the 

bidding? What --

[Laughter.] 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Go back -- what is the 

hypothetical --

JUSTICE BREYER: The hypothetical is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Continue on.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- that they write into the 

contract -- the party who's the licensee says, "And we 

stipulate that the licensee thinks that the patent is 

invalid." Nonetheless, the licensee wants a license, for 

business reasons. Therefore, the licensee and the 

licensor agrees that, after they sign the contract and 

he's paying a thousand dollars a month in royalties, he 

can go into court and challenge the patent." So, we 

assume that's written into the contract.

 MS. MAHONEY: Uh-huh.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And now, let us also assume a 

state of the law. The state of the law is that there is 

no public policy or any other policy that forbids such a

condition in a contract. All right?

 Now, on those two assumptions, the next thing 

that happens is that the licensee asks for a declaratory 

judgment that the patent is invalid.

 On those assumptions, is there a case or 

controversy under the Federal Constitution? If not, why 

not? 

MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, because I think 

what they're really asking for is advice about a business 

deal under those circumstances. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But he says, by the way, "If I 

win, I will, in fact, save $42 billion a year in licenses" 

MS. MAHONEY: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- "I would other have to pay." 

And the other side will -- or -- I was a thousand dollars, 

I meant 42 billion, okay?

 [Laughter.] 

MS. MAHONEY: But -- you know, but now -- but 

now, can they come even before they sign the deal? In 

other words, what's --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. Now, that's --

adversity, and come to court for answers to legal 

questions. And that has --

thought the assumption underlying the -- everybody's 

hypothetical is that, if the patent is determined to be 

invalid, that the license -- then the license agreement is 

also invalid. Is that -- is that right?

the license agreement itself is invalid. It simply --

MS. MAHONEY: Not on that patent. Right. The 

license --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would --

MS. MAHONEY: -- made.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It would be pursuant to 

the agreement. 

MS. MAHONEY: If the patent has been -- under 

Lear and other cases, if a patent has been held to be 

invalid by a final decision of a court, then I think it is 

improper for a licensee to seek to obtain --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Collective --

MS. MAHONEY: -- royalties --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if --

MS. MAHONEY: -- for that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- the royalty agreement 

says, you know, "We have a dispute about the validity of 

this patent. We don't know. We disagree. And so, we've 

entered into a compromise royalty rate that reflects the 

uncertainty." But once it's determined to be invalid, the 

license fees are not collectible.

 MS. MAHONEY: I think that that is correct, Your 

Honor, under the -- under the current state of the law.

to be invalid, there will still be a royalty payable, 

because that's what -- that's -- that is consideration for 

the fact that we are not going to start any controversy 

now." Let's assume they assume, precisely, the 

invalidity. Would you say the contract is unenforceable 

then, and the -- and the --

royalties will still be payable under this contract --

MS. MAHONEY: Uh-huh.

contingencies, which is a consideration for our bargain.

MS. MAHONEY: Well, I don't know what the 

dispute would be about, Your Honor, because it sounds like 

the contract terms would be clear. And if the contract 

terms are clear, they would simply go in accordance, 

unless they have an argument that the contract is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but I'm talking about 

jurisdictional purposes. 

MS. MAHONEY: -- unenforceable. If the -- if 

the point is that it is actually invalid, illegal, that --

that may be a different case, although I think there would 

still be an estoppel argument, that they should not be 

permitted to bring that action without giving up the 

benefits of the bargain, which is the immunity from suit. 

I mean, that is one of the fundamental problems with this 

case. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But do you see --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I thought your argument 

-- I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if -- do you see a 

difference between -- I guess you're saying there's no 

difference between my added wrinkle on the hypo and the 

Chief Justice's hypo, for jurisdictional purposes.

difference, from a jurisdictional perspective --

MS. MAHONEY: -- but I think, here, that the 

major problem, from a jurisdictional perspective, is that 

there is not anything in the language of the contract that 

gives them a right to come to court to dispute validity. 

Instead, we're --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the fact that 

it's under protest? 

MS. MAHONEY: That makes no difference, Your 

Honor. The fact is that they are making the payments 

pursuant to an agreement. They're not under compulsion of 

an injunction. They're doing it because they voluntarily 

entered into it. Altvater is completely different. 

There, there was no license agreement in force. The 

courts found that it -- that the reissue patents were 

never part of the agreement, to begin with. In other 

words, Altvater never agreed to pay royalties. Altvater 

had been sued, so there wasn't a counterclaim for 

invalidity.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could the --

MS. MAHONEY: And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- patent holder take the 

position that, "I -- Sooner or later, I'm going to have to 

fight out validity with someone, and might as well do it 

sooner rather than later, so I am not going to raise the 

license as a defense"? Would that be a "case or

controversy"? 

MS. MAHONEY: I don't think that the patent 

holder is allowed to come to court and seek a declaration 

of validity. I don't think any court has ever allowed 

that. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is it -- it's -- no, the 

patent -- the licensee is coming into court and wants a 

declaration of invalidity so it can manufacture without 

the fear of an infringement suit. 

MS. MAHONEY: And they're under a license? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. 

MS. MAHONEY: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the patent holder chooses 

not to plead the license -- chooses not to plead the 

license. Wouldn't the patent holder have that option? 

MS. MAHONEY: Yes, the patent -- well, no. I 

mean, not necessarily. Their view is that, because of the 

terms of the agreement, that the patent holder has no 

choice but to -- because they're receiving the royalties, 

to simply --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't mean their view. I 

mean, they start a lawsuit. They say, "We're -- we want"

happened here.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- "we want a declaration of 

infringement." And the patent holder doesn't take the 

position that you're taking; instead says, "I'm prepared 

to fight this out now. I know that I have the license, 

which could be an affirmative defense, but I'm not going 

to raise it. I'm going to go head to head on the validity 

of this patent." Would that be a case or controversy?

 MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor, 

because I don't think the parties are allowed to just 

decide, "Well, we'd like to do this now," when they're --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, even --

MS. MAHONEY: -- they've treated --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- even if the patent holder 

chooses not to raise the license, the court would have to, 

on its own motion, say, "Sorry, you didn't -- you're not 

the master of your defense. We decide that you have to 

effectively plead the license."

 MS. MAHONEY: I think the plaintiff has to show 

that they are here pursuant to -- that they have a legal 

right that permits them to adjudicate the issue of 

validity. What the -- what the patent owner does, or not, 

I don't think turns this into a case or controversy; that, 

instead, we have to start with the fundamental question, 

"What is the cause of action that they are attempting to 

adjudicate? Is it a contract action or is it a -- an

action under the patent laws? Is it an infringement 

action?" Here, I don't think there's any question but 

that it is -- they're trying to adjudicate an action for 

an infringement that can't arise, because they're immune 

from suit, because they continue to make their payments. 

And, under those circumstances, it is not sufficiently 

immediate to establish jurisdiction in --

JUSTICE BREYER: It is --

MS. MAHONEY: -- this Court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- it is, under other fields of 

the law, isn't it? I mean, I imagine that the very -- we 

see, all the time, declaratory judgments where a State 

passes a law and the individual says, "Well, I think this 

is unconstitutional, but my preferences are not to go to 

jail; my preferences are not to be penalized. So, my 

first choice is unconstitutional and my second is to obey 

it." There's no possibility in the world that he will 

violate that law. And yet, we've often held that, with 

regulations, you have to have the other requirements. You 

have to have the requirements that it's concrete, it's not 

just ideological, there's real harm. But, if those other 

requirements that are fulfilled, I've never seen any where 

it said that there also has to be a reasonable 

apprehension of a lawsuit in the absence of the 

declaratory judgment. I've just never found that phrase,

and I can't imagine why it would be part of the law.

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, Poe versus Ullman, 

this Court actually dismissed a declaratory judgment --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, there are many dismissed, 

for the reasons that they aren't concrete, definite --

there are a lot of reasons why to dismiss it. I'm just 

wondering if there is an additional reason that there has 

to be a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit in the 

absence of the declaratory judgment action. It's that 

phrase that I've never found anywhere --

MS. MAHONEY: We --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- and can't think of any 

reason why that would be an additional constitutional 

requirement. And I'm putting that directly to you, 

because I want to hear you give me the counterexamples.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well -- but in Poe versus Ullman, 

it was a declaratory judgment action. They were seeking 

to have a statute declared unconstitutional. And this 

Court did dismiss, because they didn't have a reasonable 

fear that they would actually be prosecuted. Dismissed 

for lack of jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And you say there has never 

been a declaratory judgment action, except in the instance 

where, in the absence of the action, the person would have 

violated the law, if it's a Government law. In other

JUSTICE KENNEDY: He -- but, in this -- in this 

case, if there's a failure to -- of -- conform to the 

terms of the license agreement, there's going to be a 

lawsuit. So, I think Poe versus Ullman is just not 

relevant.

 MS. MAHONEY: That -- it goes to the next point, 

which is that there still has to be a coercive choice. 

You have to choose -- there, they're choosing to give up 

constitutional rights in order to avoid jail and 

imprisonment, arrest and prosecution. Here --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, but --

MS. MAHONEY: -- what's at issue --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- but, in Poe versus Ullman, 

the ultimate action was basically like violating the 

contract here, and that's why it's not an applicable 

precedent.

 MS. MAHONEY: I don't -- I don't think it's like 

violating the contract here, though, Your Honor, because, 

What are the consequences here? What is the choice? 

First of all, they actually owe the royalties under the 

agreement, so they're trying to escape their bargain, not 

enforce it. That's number one. So, they're not 

forfeiting any rights under the contract, they're simply 

trying to get out of the contract.

 Number two, the consequences here, the choice

they're talking about, isn't in the nature of coercion. 

Again, they're not being arrested or prosecuted. All 

they're going to do if they walk out of this agreement, if 

they stop paying royalties -- yes, they may well be sued 

for infringement -- but, if they do, all they face is the 

loss of their discount.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But your argument seems --

MS. MAHONEY: That's --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- to be based on their having 

implicitly given up their right to sue. Isn't that right? 

That was your main argument. This is a settlement. This 

is in the nature of the settlement. As part of the 

bargain, the patent holder promises not to sue for 

infringement.

 MS. MAHONEY: It's not based on them giving up 

their right to sue, in the sense that all they have to do 

is stop paying royalties, and they can sue. They have to 

JUSTICE ALITO: But in answer to the 

hypotheticals, you seem to say it wouldn't matter if they 

explicitly did not give up their right to sue. So, what 

is left of this argument that what's involved here is 

essentially a settlement?

compromise, Your Honor, and there's nothing in this

agreement that gives them a right to sue. They have to 

find some legal right. What they're really saying -- what 

their argument has always been is that Lear actually 

creates an implied right of action for a licensee to sue 

at any time of their choosing. That's been their argument 

from the beginning.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, their concrete 

right is, as I thought you conceded earlier, that if the 

patent is declared invalid, they will not owe license 

fees.

 MS. MAHONEY: That's true. But that's getting 

the cart before the horse. What this Court said in --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's what --

MS. MAHONEY: -- U.S. v. Harvey Steel is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- a declaratory 

judgment action does, though, isn't it?

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, I don't think so, Your 

Honor. I think every single contract case in the lower 

courts where they have allowed a suit to be brought on a 

contract prior to breach, there was a genuine dispute 

about the interpretation of the terms. Here, what they're 

trying to do is adjudicate a cause of action outside of 

the contract. They're trying to adjudicate an 

infringement action and then say, "Aha, see what I have? 

I have a judgment that the patent's invalid. And so, now

I'd like to say that I don't have to pay royalties under 

my contract."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Mahoney, the patent bar is 

sort of specialized -- more than "sort of" -- it's a 

specialized bar, and I've never -- I've never been a part 

of it. Do you agree with the statement of the 

Petitioner's counsel that Gen-Probe came as a -- as a 

shock to the --

MS. MAHONEY: As a -- I do not agree that it 

came as a shock. And, in fact, I think that Warner 

Jenkinson, which is a Second Circuit case that allowed 

this kind of action back in the '70s, was one of the only 

cases ever that allowed it. And other reasons were found 

to dismiss similar kinds of claims. In Gen-Probe, it was 

a surprise that a licensee could do this. It -- the law 

-- by the time that this license was executed in the 

Federal Circuit, there was a case, called Shell Oil, where 

the Court specifically held that a licensee cannot take 

advantage of the protections of Lear until it has 

repudiated the license, stopped paying, and said that it 

wants to challenge validity. So that was the background 

rule that was in force at the time of this license. And 

then, when you couple that with the fact that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that wasn't -- the 

District Court, in this very case, seemed to say, "I think

this suit should go forward, but there's Gen-Probe, and I 

must follow Gen-Probe." The District Court, at least as I 

read it, seemed to think that Gen-Probe moved in a 

different direction from where the Federal Circuit was 

before.

 MS. MAHONEY: In all of the prior Federal 

Circuit cases, the licensee had stopped paying royalties. 

And what the Court explained in Gen-Probe is that that is 

the sine qua non, that a licensee can't establish 

jurisdiction, and it can't establish a right to challenge 

validity, if it's still paying royalties.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Ms. Mahoney, you argue, 

in the alternative, that we should dismiss it on the basis 

of equitable considerations under the Declaratory Judgment 

Act. We can't reach that argument unless we rule against 

you on the Article III question. Is that right?

 MS. MAHONEY: I don't think so, Your Honor. I 

think you can, because I think that you can do it as an 

alternative threshold prudential jurisdictional dismissal 

in the nature --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We would have to be 

assuming that we had jurisdiction, wouldn't we? 

MS. MAHONEY: I think that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Under Article III?

 MS. MAHONEY: I think that a prudential

dismissal under Article III would also be fine, and that 

Steel Co. would allow for that kind of dismissal, because 

Wilton said that you can dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, 

at the front end, on prudential grounds if you know that 

there would not be relief allowed at the back end.

 And I think that there's no need for a remand to 

do this. We are really talking about an equitable rule 

that has governed equitable actions for 300 years. It is 

a --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what -- but jurisdiction 

is a question of power, Does the Court have the power to 

do this? A discretion question is different. It's, "We 

have the power to entertain this case, but, as a matter of 

equity, we're not going to do so." The power question, I 

think, is a -- one that's -- it's either yes or no, either 

the court has the power, or doesn't.

 MS. MAHONEY: But I don't think that the Court 

has to answer that question in order to dismiss on a 

prudential ground, a prudential jurisdictional ground, and 

nor is there a need for a remand in Samuels versus 

Mackell, and in Cardinal, for instance. Those are cases 

where the Court adopted prudential rules and went ahead 

and applied them without remand. I -- and no remand's 

necessary. The Federal Circuit has already looked at 

this. They --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Mahoney, can I ask you one 

question before your light goes off? I know it's not --

goes to the "case or controversy" issue, but, in your 

view, was the bringing of this action a material breach of 

an implied condition of the contract that would justify a 

termination of a license? 

MS. MAHONEY: It would depend on whether there 

is an implied covenant, Your Honor. It wasn't --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm asking you whether --

MS. MAHONEY: -- argued below. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- you think there was. 

MS. MAHONEY: I think it -- it may well be, but 

I don't think the answer in this case turns on it, because 

I think they have to have their own right to bring the 

action, whether it's a breach or not, and that they don't. 

Because they don't have an implied right of action under 

Lear, they don't have a right to bring this action. And 

that is an essential component of their ability to 

challenge the issue of validity. So, I think that's the 

first and fundamental --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if that's so, and it's a 

super-violation of an implied covenant, and I guess you 

could get damages. 

MS. MAHONEY: I think that their theory, Your 

Honor, is that a licensee can do this at any time, and

that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I think that your theory 

is that it's a super-violation of an implied covenant. 

MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I don't think --

whether it's an implied covenant or not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: "Not only did we agree to it, 

but we you can't even do it if you agree to it."

 MS. MAHONEY: I think that an additional factor 

that bears on this analysis is also the fact that Congress 

has never created an implied right of -- has never created 

a right of action --

several quick items. 

I think -- I think, Mr. Chief Justice, you were, 

a while ago, putting the horse in front of the cart, which 

was right where it belongs. The contract claim is clear 

in the record. It's at page 136 of the joint appendix. I

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait, wait. Before you leave 

that, do you agree that it was not raised below? 

MR. KESTER: No, we don't. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- can you tell us where 

it was raised below? 

MR. KESTER: Well, it -- it's raised in the --

in the first remanded complaint. It's been a -- it's been 

here throughout. If it -- if it even matters. I mean, we 

wouldn't concede that that -- that that would even matter. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But was it raised before 

the Federal Circuit? 

MR. KESTER: Yes. The whole record was -- you 

mean was it argued --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 

MR. KESTER: I believe it was. I'd have to go 

back and -- you mean in terms of the oral argument. It 

was certainly in the briefs. It was certainly not waived. 

There was never, of course, any -- anything in 

the license, or anyplace else, where Petitioner gave up 

the right to sue. Petitioner doesn't need permission in 

the license to sue.

 And as for the shock in the lower courts when 

this case was decided, I would call to your attention what 

the Federal Circuit, in 1983, itself, said, and it quoted 

the Warner-Jenkinson case, which was the Second Circuit

case that my friend dismissed somewhat. The C.R. Bard 

case -- this is Federal Circuit, early -- starts out, the 

opening line -- it says, and I quote -- this is 716 F.2d 

875 -- "We hold that a patent license need not be 

terminated before a patent licensee may bring a Federal 

declaratory judgment action," close quote. And the last 

words of the same opinion, at 882 of 716 F.2d, are, "We 

hold that a patent licensee may bring a Federal 

declaratory judgment action to declare the Federal -- to 

declare the patent subject to the license invalid without 

prior termination of the -- of the license." That was 

1983. Gen-Probe was 2004. Something happened in the 

interval. 

Finally, the discussion of settlements here 

strikes me as, indeed, strange, because if this -- if a 

license were to be redesignated as a settlement, we would 

have the situation here where -- a license was signed in 

1977; the only patent at issue in this case was not even 

issued until 2001.
