 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 07-10374, Haywood v. Drown.

 Mr. Murtagh.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JASON E. MURTAGH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MURTAGH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 In a 4-3 decision, the New York Court of 

Appeals affirmed Correction Law Section 24, which 

prohibits Petitioner from bringing a Section 1983 claim 

for money damages in any court of the State of New York.

 Instead, that statute relegates Mr. Haywood 

and anyone else seeking money damages under section 1983 

to either bring their case in Federal court or to accept 

what the New York legislature has deemed a State law 

alternative. That State law alternative does not allow 

Mr. Haywood to sue the prison guards who violated his 

civil rights; instead he can only sue the State. It 

provides for no punitive damages, it provides for no 

attorneys' fees; a shortened 90-day notice of claim 

provision, 30 days shorter than what this Court found 

violative in Felder; and provides for no right to jury 

trial.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It does provide for a 

waiver of sovereign immunity and says that the State 

will respond in damages. It might be -- I'm not sure --

that many prisoners would prefer this. They have got a 

solvent -- I hope they're solvent -- defendant.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MURTAGH: Your Honor, it is true that 

the State has waived sovereign immunity for claims 

brought in the Court of Claims under that State law. 

But, Your Honor, they haven't waived sovereign immunity 

for punitive damages or for attorneys' fees, both of 

which are remedies that are specifically available to 

Petitioners, to plaintiffs, in section 1983 actions.

 This State law alternative, even if it 

didn't independently violate the supremacy clause by 

substituting New York's judgment for that of Congress, 

would not actually be a real alternative for Mr. Haywood 

or for anyone else who wanted to bring a suit against 

prison officials.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we can just mark 

that place in the record. It -- it does seem to me that 

there is some real benefits to the prisoners under --

under the New York scheme. It's -- many counsel may 

think it's preferable than to sue under 1983.

 MR. MURTAGH: Your Honor -- Your Honor,

there may be -- reasonable minds I think could differ, I 

think, about whether it's preferable to have the State 

as a solvent entity or the -- or the prison employee as 

a defendant.  But I think there's two important points 

on that.

 Number one, in their briefing, the 

Respondents have argued that they will indemnify State 

employees regardless of where the case is brought. If 

the State has already agreed to provide indemnification, 

then you don't need the State as a defendant simply to 

be solvent. The State has already --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, except in --

they said except in cases where the guards are acting 

outside the scope of their employment.

 MR. MURTAGH: Yes, Your Honor. Under 

Correction Law Section 24, if the guard is acting 

outside the scope of the employment, then the case can 

be brought in New York's courts of general jurisdiction.

 The important point here, Your Honors, is 

there are two separate related reasons that this law is 

unconstitutional. The first is because New York's 

legislature has redefined the remedies available under 

section 1983, they have, in effect, substituted their 

judgment about what constitutes good policy for 

Congress's judgment.

In this particular case, Mr. Haywood or any 

other plaintiff in New York State, could bring a section 

1983 claim in State court, but only if he agrees to give 

up his right to seek money damages.

 Congress determined, in setting forth the 

purpose and the effect of section 1983, that plaintiffs 

ought to be entitled to both money damages and equitable 

damages.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He can still get that in 

Federal court, can't he?

 MR. MURTAGH: Your Honor, it's --

Justice Scalia it's absolutely true that Mr. Haywood 

could bring his case in Federal court and would be 

entitled to all the remedies available under section 

1983 had he brought it in Federal court. But that issue 

is not dispositive in this case. And the reason it's 

not dispositive is that in the whole line of cases that 

this Court has considered where it has required States 

to hear actions as long as they hear similar or 

analogous actions, a Federal forum was available in each 

of those cases as well.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess there's a 

difference. I mean, obviously Felder is significant 

help to you. But I suppose it's a difference to say 

they've redefined the cause of action under Federal law

and said they are just not going to hear it at all. It 

may seem paradoxical, but the latter may be from a 

constitutional point of view the sounder 

characterization, because it's obviously not the 

responsibility or the authority of States to say, well, 

this is how the Federal law is going to be applied.

 But it might be their -- their -- within 

their authority to say, look, this is what our State 

court system provides and if you don't like it for a 

Federal claim, you have always got the Federal courts.

 MR. MURTAGH: Your Honor, under this Court's 

decisions not only in Felder but going back to Martinez, 

this Court has said that -- that it hasn't decided 

whether a State is required to create a court to hear 

Federal claims. And I don't think the Court needs to 

reach that issue in this case, because New York has 

already established courts of general jurisdiction, its 

supreme court, the trial level court, that are competent 

to hear these cases.

 These courts regularly hear common law tort 

cases, they regularly hear section 1983 --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, but `they are 

not really or at least you can view it as they are not 

discriminating against the Federal cause of action, 

because they don't allow the State cause of action of

the sort you want to pursue either.

 MR. MURTAGH: Your Honor, that seems to be 

the crux of the Respondents' argument. And I think the 

fundamental problem with that argument is that, although 

New York specifically exempts prison -- cases against 

prison officials, that's not enough. And the reason 

it's not enough is that if you can merely invoke the 

word "jurisdiction," as this Court pointed out in 

Howlett, the mere -- the force of the Supremacy Clause 

is not so weak that it can be evaded by the mere mention 

of the word "jurisdiction."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's --

that's true. And Howlett does say that. But as we've 

pointed out on many occasions, "jurisdiction" is a term 

that covers a lot of different things. And at some 

point something starts to look jurisdictional, which is, 

look, we're not going to hear your case at all. In 

other areas, even if they call it jurisdictional, it 

really doesn't seem that way, such as, well, you've got 

to give this much notice or you've got to -- you know, 

maybe those things aren't really jurisdictional. But 

saying you can't bring the case at all strikes me as 

really jurisdictional.

 MR. MURTAGH: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

think there are a couple of points on that. The first

is that in the cases where this Court has found that 

there was a neutral jurisdictional rule, Herb v. 

Pitcairn, Douglas, Mayfield, and then later in 

Johnson v. Frankell, in every single one of those cases 

the underlying rule of jurisdiction did not speak to the 

identity of the parties and did not address the 

underlying substance of the claim. Those were rules 

that simply talked about how a case could move through 

the courts.

 For example, in Douglas neither party was a 

resident of the State of New York and the New York court 

said: If you're not residents, you can't come in and 

use our courts.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's not how it moves 

through the courts. That is, you don't have a forum. 

That sounds to me like a jurisdictional ruling. Those 

cases that say, our courts don't sit to hear cases where 

the parties are nonresidents, both sides; our courts 

don't sit to hear cases about accidents that happened in 

Timbuktu, those sound like, we don't offer a forum for 

that type of case, as distinguished from here, where New 

York does have a forum, it just won't kind of give one 

kind of relief.

 MR. MURTAGH: Justice Ginsburg, I think -- I 

think that that is exactly right. The point here is

that in -- in -- in Douglas, where the court did not --

where the New York courts did not allow any party --

where both parties were nonresidents of New York they 

wouldn't hear the case, that applied regardless of the 

identity of the employee. It didn't matter whether the 

defendant was an employee of the State of New York or 

not.

 And it also applied regardless of what the 

underlying substantive claim was. It didn't matter 

whether it was a tort action or a contract action or 

anything else. If you weren't in New York, if you 

weren't a resident of New York, you couldn't take 

advantage of its -- of its courts.

 And in -- in Herb v. Pitcairn, where you had 

the situation where there was a -- there was a railroad 

accident brought in one county court in Illinois, it 

should have been brought in a different county court, 

the Court went -- went out of its way to say the State 

of Illinois has provided other forums, other State 

courts where you could have brought this case.

 And if the State, for example, in the 

present case had said, Mr. Haywood, you filed this case 

in Wyoming County Supreme Court and it really should 

have been brought down in Syracuse, that would be a 

neutral rule of jurisdiction. It just dictates where

the case ought to be brought.

 By contrast, what New York has done here is 

that they have absolutely forbidden anyone to seek money 

damages against a prison official. And the reason that 

they did that, as conceded in the Respondents' briefing, 

is because they don't want prison officials to be 

distracted from their duties. They don't want prison 

officials to have to face the fear of vexatious 

lawsuits.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose the -- the New 

York legislature said, you have a choice, you can bring 

a 1983 suit or you can bring this sort of suit against 

the State, and the State will respond to damages, but 

you can't do both. Can they do that?

 MR. MURTAGH: No, Your Honor, I don't think 

they could. Once the State -- this Court's 

jurisprudence teaches us that once a court -- once a 

State opens its courts to hear analogous State law 

claims, it cannot then close its doors selectively to 

Federal claims.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What Justice Kennedy has 

asked you: Say, you could have this Federal claim, but 

we are going to offer you a substitute under New York 

law, which the Federal authority could not force us to 

do, because it's a State waiving its sovereign immunity.

MR. MURTAGH: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg; 

certainly the State of New York could offer a State law 

alternative in addition to section 1983.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, no, I said in the 

alternative.

 MR. MURTAGH: Okay. I don't believe, 

Justice Kennedy, that -- that New York could force a 

plaintiff to give up the right to sue section -- sue 

under section 1983 if the courts are otherwise open to 

tort actions in similar circumstances.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Now, suppose 

they do it -- they say -- we are just talking about the 

State courts: you can't bring both types in State 

courts. You can still have your Federal cause of action 

in the Federal court, and we will also give our cause of 

action where the State's law is violated, but not both 

in the New York courts.

 MR. MURTAGH: No, Justice Kennedy. Once --

once New York establishes courts of general jurisdiction 

that are competent to hear these kinds of cases, it 

can't close its doors to section 1983 claims for money 

damages.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's okay for the State 

to say, we don't want any tort actions in our courts? 

That would be all right?

MR. MURTAGH: Yes, Justice Scalia. It 

seems --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's strange. Why -- but 

it can't do the lesser thing of saying, we don't want 

this particular type of tort action. One is 

jurisdictional -- you would say it's jurisdictional, 

right? And this one is not jurisdictional, just because 

it's narrower? It's still directed to the type of 

action.

 MR. MURTAGH: Justice Scalia, I think the 

distinction is -- relates to the relative power of 

Congress and the States. Once Congress has spoken and 

has provided a Federal cause of action, that becomes New 

York law. And New York, as long as it has a court, is 

required to enforce that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but not if New York 

said, we don't want any tort actions. What about if New 

York says, we don't want any -- uh -- personal injury 

tort actions? Would that be enough, or is that too 

narrow? And I'm going to narrow it down after that 

until I get down to your case.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MURTAGH: Justice Scalia, I -- I am not 

sure exactly where the line is in terms of the analogy. 

I think this case is very far on the other side. In

other words, because New York State here -- even here, a 

section 1983 claim, this isn't a situation where they 

say, we have a court that's not competent to hear 

section 1983 claims. They simply say: We're not going 

to allow them to hear section 1983 claims for money 

damages where there is a prison official who's -- who is 

the defendant.

 If the defendant here, Justice Scalia, were 

a police officer who had engaged in the same conduct, 

New York State courts would have to hear that case. So 

this is not the sort of thing --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that. I just 

don't understand -- you acknowledge it's okay if it's 

jurisdictional; and you acknowledge that it is 

jurisdictional if you don't allow any tort actions. I 

just don't know what makes this to be 

non-jurisdictional. I don't know.

 MR. MURTAGH: I think it -- intellectually, 

Justice Scalia, it seems to me that the distinction is 

that -- that there has to be a point at which you do 

respect the relative authority of the State and the 

Federal Governments. By saying that a State may -- we 

are not going to require that a State establish a court 

to hear a whole kind of action that they otherwise 

wouldn't hear, that's providing some deference to the

authority of the State, as the Respondents point out, 

part of the core sovereignty of the State, to establish 

their courts and to run their courts.

 By contrast, once they have done that, once 

they provided that court system, then the power balance 

shifts.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if this were at 

the beginning of whenever New York was establishing a 

court system, and they said from the outset, look, we 

are not going to hear these types of cases, then this 

would be okay?

 MR. MURTAGH: Your Honor, I think under this 

Court's jurisprudence that would -- if the State of New 

York said we are not going to hear any kind of tort 

action, regardless of whether it's Federal or State, and 

it doesn't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, that's 

mixing the two points. Your point I understand it --

MR. MURTAGH: Okay.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- is that once the 

court has opened it up to a particular type of claim, 

they can't say, say no more. So if they are setting 

up -- obviously we are not going to go back to whenever 

the New York State courts was established. But if they 

suddenly said, we are going to revise our court system

or - or modernize it, and from now on we are not going 

to do this?

 MR. MURTAGH: As long as -- as long as the 

withdrawal of jurisdiction was across all analogous 

State law claims as well as the Federal claim, then, 

yes. I mean, we could discuss whether that would be a 

good idea or not, but I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, we would discuss what 

is analogous.

 MR. MURTAGH: Yes, and that's -- that's a 

very good point, Justice Scalia; and this Court has told 

us as litigants what it thinks are analogous claims. In 

Felder, this Court said an analogous claim for purposes 

of section 1983 is a common law tort. That's the thing 

that's most like a section 1983 claim. So the real 

question here is does New York State provide courts that 

can hear common law tort claims? There is no dispute in 

this case that they do.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, why can't New York 

take the position, we want to be realistic about these 

suits? New York has provided that it is going to --

it's going to pick up the tab. If you sue a 

correctional officer, New York is going to pick up the 

tab.

 So -- so we are going to channel this suit

to the court, the one court in the State that deals with 

the State, the sovereign, paying money, the court of 

claims. So all they are doing is recognizing the 

reality that this is a suit against New York, not the 

correctional officer because it won't cost the 

correctional officer a dime; New York is going to 

provide counsel and is going to pay any judgment.

 So really where this case belongs is in the 

court that hears claims against the State of New York.

 MR. MURTAGH: Justice Ginsburg, the problem 

with that analysis, I think, is that in the court of 

claims there are all sorts of other limitations.

 This -- this notion that this is simply a 

substitute claim and that it's just as good enough, I 

think really is a red herring in this case; because what 

has happened here is not that New York has created a 

separate court with specialized expertise that knows how 

to try these cases, which it probably could do under 

this Court's jurisprudence. Rather, what it has done is 

it's required you to sue the State instead of the 

individual, and then put a whole host of limitations on 

the sort of relief that you can seek, and on the way 

that you can bring your case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's done exactly 

what the Federal system has done. So that if you have a

money claim against -- that is going to be against the 

Federal Government, here's what you do: You go to the 

Court of Claims, you have to go to the Court of Claims; 

and in that court all sorts of special rules apply about 

notice and other things.

 MR. MURTAGH: And that is absolutely true, 

Justice Roberts, if the claim initially were a claim 

against the State. But of course section 1983 doesn't 

provide for a claim against the State. In Will v. 

Michigan this Court held that the State is not a person 

for purposes of section 1983, and so the only way you 

can have a section 1983 claim --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but in the 

Federal system if you sue a Federal official or a 

postman and in fact in reality it's going to be a claim 

against the United States, that has to go to the Court 

of Claims, too.

 MR. MURTAGH: And Your Honor, that is 

absolutely something that Congress can decide to do with 

respect to Federal law, and New York can decide with 

respect to State law to do whatever it wants in terms of 

setting up where those claims can go.

 What New York cannot do is to impose that 

policy judgment on the Federal claim, because Congress 

has already determined --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess my point is 

that there's nothing fishy about what New York has done 

here. Which leads me to think, well, maybe it's not 

really discrimination against the Federal claim, it's a 

rational way to handle claims against the State 

treasury, just as the Federal system is a rational way 

to handle claims against the Federal treasury.

 MR. MURTAGH: Regardless of how rational an 

idea this is or how good an idea this is, for this Court 

to adopt a rule that says that once a State disagrees 

with Congress about how people ought to be liable under 

a Federal remedy would require this Court in essence to 

say that the rationale of several of your previous cases 

could be undone. And I think this Court pointed out in 

Howlett that if all you had to do was say, our courts 

won't have jurisdiction over a certain category of 

claims that -- the Wisconsin legislature in Felder could 

have said: Our courts shall have no jurisdiction unless 

there is 120-day notice of claim provided.

 The courts in Martinez in California -- the 

California legislature could have said, our State courts 

will have no jurisdiction --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that just goes 

back to our previous colloquy about what jurisdiction is 

and what it means. I mean, are you saying that if we

look at this and we decide yes, this does really look 

like jurisdiction in the real sense, rather than just a 

jurisdictional label -- if we do that, then you lose?

 MR. MURTAGH: I think that if this Court 

found that this were a jurisdiction -- a neutral rule of 

jurisdiction that constituted a valid excuse, that, yes, 

that would probably -- that would probably undermine my 

argument significantly.

 I think to get there, Chief Justice, you 

would have to -- you would have to sort of engage in 

some interesting thinking which I haven't gotten my mind 

around, to be quite honest. The -- what this Court said 

in Howlett is, when we talk about jurisdiction, when we 

talk about what constitutes jurisdiction, we are talking 

about whether there is power over the subject matter and 

power over the parties involved. And I don't think the 

Respondents in this case even argue that the New York 

supreme courts don't have the power over the parties 

here or don't have competence over this kind of subject 

matter.

 This case doesn't have any of the 

attributes, this rule, this correctional law section 24, 

doesn't have any of the attributes of a neutral 

procedural rule --

the legislature says it is? Do you think there is some 

sort of -- you know, a Platonic ideal of jurisdiction 

versus non-jurisdiction, and that's what we apply here?

 MR. MURTAGH: Justice Alito, I think that 

jurisdiction -- that to determine whether a rule is 

jurisdictional requires that this Court look at the 

purpose and the effect of the underlying statute. And 

if all a State has to do is say it's jurisdictional and 

if jurisdiction is whatever the State says it is, then 

that means that, going back to Felder and Martinez and 

some of those cases, a State could -- could evade this 

Court's rulings merely by reframing the statutes in the 

words of jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So what is the -- what is 

the standard for determining whether it's jurisdictional 

or not?

 MR. MURTAGH: Well, Justice Alito, the --

the important points, I think, come out of Felder: That 

it is a neutral rule that is applicable to all cases and 

that is not concerned with the underlying substance of 

the claim. So, for example, when we go back to the old 

cases, Douglas, Mayfield, Herb v. Pitcairn, this Court 

was looking at situations where there were rules that 

applied everywhere.

that it would be okay and would be a jurisdictional rule 

if the court -- if the State courts did not entertain 

tort actions. That's a rule that goes to the substance 

of the claim, isn't it?

 MR. MURTAGH: Well, Your Honor, it goes to 

the substance of the claim, but it applies generally 

across all claims. It's not -- it's not picking and 

choosing. It's not targeted towards a specific --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, it's picking and 

choosing tort claims.

 MR. MURTAGH: Well, it's picking and 

choosing tort claims as opposed, I suppose, to contract 

claims.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. MURTAGH: But it's not, Your Honor, 

saying: We're going to accept this kind of tort claim 

but not that kind of tort claim. We're going to allow 

to you sue a police officer who beats you up, but you 

can't sue a corrections officer who beats you up. 

That's the real difference, I think.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there something you add 

-- you add to your statement of your rule? A neutral 

rule not related to substance, but related to the 

administration of the courts?

 MR. MURTAGH: Yes, Justice Breyer. I think

that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Don't just be agreeable to 

be agreeable. Do cases actually say that?

 MR. MURTAGH: I think, Your Honor -- I'd 

have to get the exact language from Felder, but I think 

that it is a neutral rule regarding the administration 

of the courts that is unrelated to the underlying 

substance of the matter or the nature of the parties.

 Your Honors, the most recent -- going on a 

little bit about this jurisdictional issue -- the most 

recent case that held that there was a neutral rule of 

judicial administration, a neutral procedural rule, was 

Johnson v. Fankell. And this Court will recall that, in 

that case, Idaho had a rule that required that there be 

a final judgment before an intermediate -- before an 

appeal could be taken from that.

 This Court allowed Idaho to impose that rule 

on a section 1983 claim because the defendants there had 

argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity. 

They lost at the trial level. They then sought an 

interlocutory appeal. And this Court said certainly 

Idaho can set forth the ways in which you take appeal 

from any kind of a case, and, more importantly, this is 

not a rule that is targeted at civil rights claims and 

in fact may lead to over-enforcement of civil rights

claims because it prevents a defendant from getting out 

of the case very early.

 That's the kind of case where there's a 

neutral rule. That's not what we have here.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You are being generous 

when you said that we would recall -- at least that I 

would recall the case. Is it Idaho, did you say, or 

Johnson?

 MR. MURTAGH: In Johnson v. Fankell, I 

believe --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It was Johnson. I thought 

you said Idaho.

 MR. MURTAGH: Yes. I'm sorry, Your Honor. 

I just said that the Idaho courts were involved in that 

one.

 Your Honor, the approach that's urged by the 

Respondents in this -- in this case really would dictate 

different results, as I mentioned. You'd wind up -- in 

Felder and in Martinez, the courts could just use the 

word "jurisdiction." And actually, even if you go back 

to three of this Court's earlier cases, Mondou in 1912, 

McKnett in 1934, Testa v. Katt in 1947 -- in Testa v. 

Katt, this Court required Connecticut to hear an 

Emergency Price Control Act even though Connecticut 

regularly refused to hear cases that they thought were

penal in nature. And what this Court said was: You 

hear analogous claims; you have to hear the Emergency 

Price Control Act.

 Now, if this Court were to adopt a rule that 

the State could simply say, we have no jurisdiction over 

certain categories of claims, then in Testa, Connecticut 

could simply have said: We are not going to have 

jurisdiction over any case seeking penal or punitive 

types of damages. That would require that we really 

undo a lot of this Court's jurisprudence.

 If there are no further questions at this 

point, I would reserve my time, Mr. Chief Justice.

Murtagh.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The Federal Constitution permits State 

courts to hear Federal claims, but it does not require a 

State to hear them so long as the State does not 

discriminate against Federal claims in comparison with 

similar State claims.

 New York's statute fully satisfies that

requirement. New York courts cannot hear damage actions 

against prison officials for conduct in the scope of 

their employment. And it doesn't matter whether State 

or Federal law is the basis for the claim.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Ms. Underwood, if that's 

going to be the criterion, that they exclude a State 

cause of action as readily as they exclude a Federal 

cause of action, then isn't the State always going to 

win every case in which there is an issue like this one? 

Because unless the State is so blatantly discriminatory 

or so blatantly inadvertent as to leave a cause of 

action of its own making on the books, when it says, "We 

won't hear the Federal one," what you posit is always 

going to be the case. And if that's -- if the rule is 

that as long as there is no State action comparable to 

the Federal action that is disallowed, the State wins, 

in practical terms the State always wins.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, that's not so. This 

Court has in fact invalidated statutes and found 

discrimination. There were -- three of the early FELA 

-- two FELA cases and the Testa case itself. In Testa, 

contrary to what was just suggested, the Court -- this 

Court found discrimination. When Rhode Island said that 

it wasn't going to hear the emergency price control 

penal statute --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose a State 

extends --

MS. UNDERWOOD: -- the Court --

JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose a State extends 

sovereign immunity to a broad class of State employees 

with reference to State law claims. Would that mean 

that the State could close its courts to all 1983 

actions --

MS. UNDERWOOD: No. Immunity --

JUSTICE ALITO: -- against those same 

defendants?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: No. Immunity and 

jurisdiction are really quite different. They both have 

the result that the defendant loses.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if they phrase it 

in terms of jurisdiction? There is no jurisdiction in 

courts of New York to hear any intentional tort action 

against a correctional official for action taken during 

the performance of the correctional officer's duties. 

Do they then close the New York courts completely to 

1983 actions against correctional officials?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: If they not only used the 

word "jurisdiction" but gave the rule jurisdictional 

effect -- that is to say, a jurisdictional bar is one 

that can't be waived by the defendants, whereas immunity

can be waived. So it protects courts, not defendants.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Underwood, there is a 

feature of this case, even assuming that you were right 

about -- New York has not withdrawn jurisdiction from 

its courts over a 1983 claim; it has simply limited, 

taken away, one mode of relief. That is, you can sue a 

correctional official for declaratory relief, you could 

sue for injunctive relief. All New York has taken away 

is one mode of relief. That's not jurisdictional unless 

you say that every element of damages is jurisdictional.

 New York allows this type of claim in their 

courts. We are talking about jurisdiction over the 

person? Yes, they have jurisdiction over the 

correctional official's person. Subject matter --

subject matter is a 1983 case? Yes. All they are 

cutting off is one form of relief.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, it's not just any form 

of relief. It's not just, for instance, the type of 

damages. The difference between law and equity has a 

long tradition in this country. They are really two 

different actions, an action for injunctive relief or an 

action for damages. The courts now hear them together. 

But what New York has said is it has no jurisdiction --

its courts have no jurisdiction against -- over damage 

actions against corrections officials.

And as I was saying earlier, jurisdiction is 

different from immunity, both because it can't be waived 

-- so it's about courts, not the defendants -- because 

it -- because a dismissal won't bar litigating the 

matter in Federal court. A dismissal -- an immunity 

would result in a judgment --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Practically --

practically, hasn't what New York has done is to confer 

on its correctional officers absolute immunity, not 

merely qualified immunity? So if you want to be 

realistic about what is the effect of New York's law, it 

says you are going to be subject to equitable relief, 

declaratory relief, but as far as money is concerned, 

you are absolutely immune.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: I don't think it's immunity. 

I think it's a refusal to hear the case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What's the difference 

of -- practically?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Practically --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't the -- isn't the 

practical effect -- if you tried to explain to 

correctional officers what is your exposure, you would 

say: You have absolute immunity from anything that's 

going to try to reach into your pocket.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Not at all. This is like a

forced removal, is what it really is.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They're -- they are liable 

in Federal court.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes, that's exactly correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They're certainly not 

immune in Federal court.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: They are fully liable in 

Federal court. That's where these cases are being 

brought right now. Congress has never expressed any 

policy for mandating that they be brought in State 

court, because even if these cases could have been 

brought in the first place in State courts, the Federal 

-- the State defendant could remove it to Federal court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the theory was 

that in our Federal system, Federal law is State law, 

too? That is the highest law for a State. Federal law 

by virtue of the Supremacy Clause is State law; and 

sometimes Congress creates an exclusive Federal 

jurisdiction over certain types of claims. But if 

Congress doesn't do that, the assumption is there is 

concurrent jurisdiction.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: That's correct. But that's 

if the Court is open to the case. The Fender case, the 

line of cases that Petitioner has been pointing to, is 

simply not applicable here where the State opens its

courts to the cases. If the State were hearing damage 

actions against corrections officers, it couldn't give 

them immunity.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But what is the neutral 

reason related to the administration of courts that 

leads the State to close its door to a damage suit under 

1983 against correctional officers?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- taking as the assumption 

exactly what Justice Ginsburg said. I mean, I can't 

find any reason that's neutral and administrative other 

than what Justice Ginsburg said, which is neither: 

namely New York does not like 1983 actions for damages 

against correctional officers. What other reason is 

there?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: First of all, these -- this 

-- I would like to correct an observation. This -- this 

is not aimed only or even principally at 1983 actions. 

This law does predate the -- not the enactment of 1983, 

but the proliferation, the use -- the widespread use of 

1983; and in fact it affects a great many State cases. 

It's not only --

JUSTICE BREYER: But Testa v Katt was a case 

in which the Court found that the State allows some 

State action that are analogous to the Federal action

and you can't discriminate against a Federal action.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: That's true.

 JUSTICE BREYER: This is not that case. 

This is a case where the State doesn't allow -- doesn't 

allow -- damage actions like the Federal action --

MS. UNDERWOOD: If --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- and this Court has not 

decided to my knowledge how we apply the basic rule in 

such a situation. So I would think that the way we 

would apply it is take the standard and ask the State, 

what is the neutral administrative-related reason? 

Because what they are saying is, if you look at this, 

from an administrative point of view, it's that 

red-haired, one-eyed man with a limp.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Prisons are large 

institutions in rural counties that generate a vast 

amount of litigation. This particular prisoner was in a 

prison in a rural county like Wyoming County that had I 

think 3,000 or so prisoners in it, and the litigation 

generated by the prisons isn't just actions by 

prisoners. This statute doesn't apply only to actions 

against -- by prisoners. It also applies to actions by 

prison employees against other prison employees --

actions by anybody against a -- corrections officials. 

So it's all the vast forms of litigation, principally

but not exclusively prisoner complaints, that arise out 

of prisons.

 That is a very large and burdensome amount 

of litigation, unlike litigation against State police, 

which some have said is comparable, which is dispersed 

all over the State. This is concentrated where the 

large prisons are; and it is a reasonable decision -- a 

neutral reason, if you will -- for the State to decide 

to take those actions out of the courts of general 

jurisdiction, to take actions -- damage actions arising 

out of the prisons out of the courts of general 

jurisdiction, where it would be concentrated in a few 

counties where the large prisons are.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: General Underwood, your 

friend on the other side acknowledges that if New York 

states closed its courts to tort actions, that would be 

okay. But I don't see how closing your courts to tort 

actions has any administrative -- particular 

administrative rationale behind it, do you?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: No, and I don't believe that 

this Court's cases about jurisdiction, as distinguished 

from its cases about case handling rules, require that 

kind of neutral administrative feature.

 I only was suggesting that there exists such 

an explanation for this rule; but in fact, this Court

has treated quite differently cases about case handling, 

and that makes sense. Because if you hear a claim -- if 

the State hear a claim and then impose even a 

nondiscriminatory -- but it's certainly a discriminatory 

rule that tends to defeat the claim, the State might 

induce plaintiffs to bring their claims in State court 

and then lose them under disadvantageous procedures.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose that the State of 

New York said that in suits against corrections --

against the corrections department, against the State, 

there should be no damages awarded to a prisoner in 

excess of $3,000; and then the --

MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and then 1980 -- and 

then the prisoner tries to bring a 1983 suit in State 

court.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would the case -- would 

the analysis be just the same?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: No, I don't think the 

analysis would be the same. I think once the State 

opens its doors to a damage action against corrections 

officials, the question would be -- the answer might or 

might not come out the same way, but I think it probably 

would come out differently.

The -- the question would be, does that 

procedural rule -- there are two questions: Is it 

discriminatory? You're saying -- your hypothetical is 

that it's not discriminatory as between State and 

Federal, and the second question would be does it 

undermine the Federal cause -- does it undermine the 

Federal claim?

 And so in Martinez, when this Court said 

State immunities can't apply to Federal 1983 actions, 

only Federal immunities can apply, the Court was careful 

to observe that California had opened its courts to this 

case and had an immunity, whereas --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In my hypothetical, do you 

think it undermines the Federal claims?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: No. I think it could be 

argued, I think it would be argued that limiting damages 

undermines a Federal action that is meant to bar courts 

from interpretation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But why can't it be argued 

here that Congress has an important mechanism in holding 

prison officials -- prison correctional officers --

personally liable, so that they are themselves aware 

that they have a constitutional obligation that is 

enforceable against them, and New York has taken this 

away?

Now you may -- we may argue that if the 

State responds in damages, the prisoner is better off; 

but Congress has not made that judgment. Congress has 

made the judgment that the correctional officer himself 

or herself should be responsible.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, I don't believe 

Congress has made that judgment. So that I -- and 

that's my answer to why I don't think this undermines 

the Federal cause --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, it has made that 

judgment. That's the whole purpose of 1983.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: No, the purpose of 1983 is 

to -- actually was two things. It's to provide a 

Federal forum and it was to provide compensation for 

these torts, and I believe that these --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He's still responsible, 

right? I mean --

MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: He's still responsible.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: I think there is no Federal 

policy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, the correctional 

officer, under the scheme we are talking about, is not 

responsible in damages.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: He is responsible to exactly

the same degree as he would be, were he sued personally, 

because New York indemnifies him and there is no 

requirement -- Congress has never shown any objection to 

indemnification.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But -- does your case turn 

on whether or not there is an indemnification agreement?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: I don't know that our case 

turns on whether --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I shouldn't think so. 

That hasn't been your argument so far.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, what I'm saying is to 

the extent -- I don't believe we need to -- if you think 

that we need to -- that there may be a conflict with a 

Federal policy, I think the statute stands because it's 

nondiscriminatory and jurisdictional. But if there is a 

question, it's not a question of whether -- yes.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Just you ask an offshoot 

of Justice Kennedy's question. Supposing you had a 

statute that said in railroad cases there should be no 

damage -- railroad tort cases, brought by employees of 

railroads, there was no damage judgment in excess of 

$10,000, in State court? Would that be okay?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: No, I don't think so, for 

the same reason I don't think -- that is, if you have a 

tort remedy that the State is hearing than a limit on

recovering that goes -- that is inconsistent with 

congressional policy is not permitted. But if the State 

were to say we won't hear any tort cases or we won't 

hear any tort cases involving railroads or we won't hear 

any tort cases --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think --

consistently with our FELA cases it could have a rule 

that no tort -- no tort cases may be brought by railroad 

employees against the railroad in a State court.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: State or Federal. There is 

nothing in your FELA cases that says that as long as the 

State is closing its doors equally. And there are, of 

course, political reasons --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they shouldn't have 

closed the Federal doors under the FELA. They surely 

could bring the suit under Federal.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: No, but -- but --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you are saying they 

could -- as opposed to State courts, the suits against 

railroads where the damage gets -- over $10,000?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: No, I don't think they could 

put the damage requirement on, because then they would 

be --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But they could totally 

close it?

MS. UNDERWOOD: They could totally close the 

doors, and I think that's different. That is not 

hearing the case, and in closing -- closing the doors of 

the court evenhandedly to State and Federal cases. That 

is -- that is --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If you leave the door open 

to suits against every other possible defendant except 

railroads? I mean, it seems to me your hardest case is 

really the FELA cases here.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: I think the FELA cases, some 

of which were -- some exclusions were upheld and some of 

which were struck down, support our position, because 

they only strike down exclusions of jurisdiction where 

there is a discrimination, where the Court finds a 

discrimination between the Federal and State claim.

 In Mondou, Connecticut was hearing suits 

against railroads under State law. It was even hearing 

suits against railroads under other States' law that 

imposed -- liability, but it was refusing to hear only 

suits under Federal law. And that's why the Court 

struck it down.

 Similarly, in McKnett and in Testa, in each 

case this Court struck down in limitation on the 

ground -- not that the State had an absolute obligation 

to hear the Federal claim, but that it had an

obligation, if it was going to exclude jurisdiction, to 

exclude it evenhandedly.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that in Testa 

the State said we are evenhanded, we don't bring -- we 

don't allow penal actions to be -- to be brought on the 

civil side of our court?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: But what -- but what this 

Court pointed to in Testa was that while they said that, 

they did, in fact, hear pun -- double damage actions, 

which is what this was. It was penal in a sense not of 

being a criminal, but as being a double damage -- a 

multiple damage action.

 And what the Court said was because Rhode 

Island does hear double damage actions arising under its 

own law and under the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, 

essentially the rational they gave for excluding the 

Emergency Press Control Act had been proven false and 

must -- unless as the only explanation unwillingness to 

enforce the emergency press control.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So what you have now is you 

have one reason, I think, would be clearly wrong; I 

think, I assume that. But if the State closed their 

doors to this kind of suit because they say we think our 

correctional officers should be immune from damages, now 

we know they can get money under the Federal law, but we

want nothing to do with this. That, I think, would be 

discrimination against the suit if that were their 

reason.

 Now, there is a neutral reason, and it's 

demonstrated, and it is, well, you see, there are just 

too many -- there are just too many lawsuits by 

prisoners against prison officials. And we don't want 

all that business in that court, and here's how we deal 

with it.

 One, we take away their cause of action, 

that's what we do under State law, and then we -- the 

feds -- we throw them back to Fed court? Without --

MS. UNDERWOOD: Or -- or we offer them a 

court of claims.

 JUSTICE BREYER: You don't offer them a 

court of claims, because what you offer in the court of 

claims is an action against the State. And you can say 

that isn't a big deal because after all, most of these 

really are actions against the State anyway, because 

they get compensated.

 Okay, so if I treat that as neutral, I have 

one bad reason and one good reason. And how do I know 

which is which? That is, is it really true that there 

are a lot of suits brought in State courts in places 

with prisons under 1983 for damages rather than Federal

courts? I don't know what the numbers are? Have you 

looked them up at all?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, they aren't -- this is 

what I can tell you. I think 1983, they are -- I mean, 

suits against --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- 1983 actions, but maybe 

they bring them mostly in Federal court.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: They do bring them in 

Federal court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So one way to test 

this out would be the following: If we had numbers and 

knew, you know, about how many State -- how many damage 

actions against prisoners were being brought in State 

courts in districts that have prisons there, and then we 

saw how much New York was really hurting and then we 

asked another question, maybe there is some Federal 

security actions, you see, where there is no State 

comparable action and we found out, well, the State lets 

them bring these actions in State court. So, there are 

ways of dealing with this empirically. Have you any 

sense of it?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, what I can tell you is 

that there are a great many State law -- I can't tell 

you numbers -- a great many State law actions against 

corrections officers. They are either in the court of

claims or they are in Federal court because this statute 

says that the courts have no jurisdiction over the 

damage actions, and it doesn't matter whether they are 

1983 or state law. But there are a great many -- I 

mean, it says to -- read them.

 The State law actions -- there are many 

state law actions that can't be constitutionally 

characterized. There is all kinds of, you know, 

damaging loss to property, medical malpractice, 

negligence, failure to protect from harm, things that --

many things that the prisoners bring suits against that 

are not constitutional. They aren't in the Supreme 

Court. They would be if you struck this statute down.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It's not really that they 

are not the Supreme Court, but the -- the damages are 

limited, aren't they, because in the court of claims, as 

I understand it or under the statute, there can't be any 

punitive damages? Whereas if it were a straight 1983 

action in the State supreme court, punitive damages 

would -- would be a possibility.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, there are two things 

to say about punitive damages. One is that, yes --

there are three things -- there are no punitive damages 

in the court of claims. Punitive damages, of course, 

are available in Federal court, which is fully available

to these plaintiffs and is where they normally are if 

they think they have a punitive damage claim.

 It is also case that actions outside the 

scope of employment are not covered by this statute.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: They could be brought into 

the state supreme court --

MS. UNDERWOOD: They could be brought into 

the state court.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- which is a -- which is 

one of your jurisdictional problems because the --

the -- in effect, New York is saying the most -- the 

most egregious class of cases, the cases in which the 

correctional officers are not only doing some actionable 

but something outside the scope of their duty, well, we 

will hear them, they are fine. And we will provide 

punitive damages for them.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Which -- which makes it a 

little tough to say that in the less egregious cases 

there is a -- that the -- that the exclusion of the less 

egregious cases is a jurisdictional exclusion as 

distinct from an exclusion based upon policy about how 

less egregious cases ought to be handled.

treated as jurisdictional. The New York courts say --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but aren't you simply 

saying, look, we go around calling it jurisdictional. 

And -- and my point was, that isn't it difficult, isn't 

it, in fact, inappropriate to call it jurisdictional 

when you have a class of the most egregious cases under 

1983 which the State supreme courts hear, and there is, 

nonetheless, a second class of cases, also 1983 -- they 

simply happen to be less egregious -- that they don't 

hear? Isn't it difficult, using jurisdictional in the 

normal sense of the term, to say that is a 

jurisdictional distinction?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: No, because what the 

jurisdictional bar is for damage actions against 

correctional officers where actions is the scope of 

their employment -- and the New York courts don't just 

say it's jurisdictional. They give it the effect of a 

jurisdictional bar.

legislature passed a statute saying the -- the State 

court supreme court will not have jurisdiction over 1983

you say that that was a jurisdictional rule?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, what I can tell you is 

that there are a great many State-law -- I can't tell 

you the numbers. There are a great many State-law 

actions against corrections officers.

 They are either in the Court of Claims, or 

they are in Federal courts because this statute says 

that the courts have no jurisdiction over the damage 

actions. And it doesn't matter whether they are 1983 or

a jurisdictional exclusion as -- as distinct from a --

lay in some 1983 actions, the worst ones, the ones with 

the highest potential damages, but you say, well, the --

the less awful ones, the ones that may be within scope 

of employment, they can't come in, it seems to me that 

the -- that the teeth on the comb are getting rather 

fine. And in terms of our normal usage in -- in 

applying this criterion, it -- it is not plausibly 

jurisdictional.

case, our -- our statute is rational, because it takes

out of the courts of general jurisdiction the cases that 

are most numerous and that are most appropriately 

indemnified by the State. But it leaves in the courts 

of general jurisdiction the ones that are less numerous 

and that are not appropriately indemnified or turned 

into actions against the State. So it's rational unlike 

the Wednesday cases.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: One of the concerns I have 

in this case is the scope of employment is often 

litigated, and it would seem to me that the State of New 

York might routinely say, oh, this is not within the 

scope of employment.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Well, there is a body of 

cases that are quite generous --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Which -- which means that 

this is a very difficult distinction and is a further 

burden on the 1983 ride.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: The law of the State of New 

York is relatively clear on this. The kinds of cases 

that are outside the scope of employment are prisoner 

rapes and things that are done by corrections officers 

that do not in any way further the -- the objective. 

They are simply --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that's a rather 

routine defense. But why are they -- why are they left

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Because they are not 

appropriately -- because the State doesn't want to take 

responsibility -- when the State statute takes them from 

the supreme court, then actions on such matters can be 

brought against the State in the court of claims. And 

the state is not taking responsibility for those cases 

and will not indemnify them.

MS. UNDERWOOD: The rise of Federal 1983


actions came subsequently and -- and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that's an important 

factor, I would think. Let me ask another question. It 

-- it's a standard rule of international law that no 

State will enforce the penal laws of another State. I 

assume the Federal Government could not -- maybe I am 

wrong to assert this, but could the Federal Government 

require New York to prosecute federal crimes?

 MS. UNDERWOOD: I don't know the answer to 

that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't, either, but I 

think it can't. I think it can't, probably. Then my 

next question is going to be: Why aren't punitive 

damages penal laws as well? And if that's the same 

principle, maybe there's no big deal about New York 

excluding penal damages --

MS. UNDERWOOD: There may be, but there is 

no --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: 1983 does not -- correct 

me if I am wrong -- does not allow punitive damages 

against a State, does it?

MS. UNDERWOOD: 1983 does not allow any 

liability. 1983 has been construed not -- the State 

isn't a person; it can't be a defendant.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Not -- if I got that 

right, not in Monell.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: The State in Monell --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Even in Monell -- even in 

Monell there is no punitive damages against the State, 

which is another reason you -- you were discriminating 

against the employee here -- against the prisoner. 

Because the prisoner could get punitive damages against 

the correctional officer but not against the State in 

either court.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Where he can -- where he can 

bring his 1983 action, he can get punitive damages. The 

State has closed its door to damage actions, 1983 or 

otherwise.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In neither court can you 

get -- and correct me if I am wrong -- punitive damages 

against the State, which never --

MS. UNDERWOOD: He can get damages -- under 

1983 he can get damages against --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: He can under Monell.

 MS. UNDERWOOD: Not against -- no, not --

not against the State.

JUSTICE STEVENS: In county --

MS. UNDERWOOD: Yes. In fact, what I was 

going to say is that one of the things that shows there 

is no congressional policy focused only on individuals 

is that municipalities and other government entities are 

proper defendants. The State is not. Likely, the 

government -- the Federal policy was -- found by this 

Court in construing 1983 for not making the State a 

defendant was not that that would undermine deterrent 

and that it was preferable to sue individuals, but that 

there was some reluctance -- concern about power or 

wisdom of -- of imposing liability on the States.

 And, in fact, that is what this Court said 

in Monell and Will about why the State is not a person. 

So I don't think 1983 is fairly read as embracing a 

congressional judgment that it's better to have 

liability against individuals, better from the 

plaintiffs' point of view, than against the State.

 But the way this works is it is, in effect, 

a mandatory removal. And since Congress has no 

objection and has not prohibited removal the way it did 

in FELA cases, it's hard to see how the congressional 

policy is frustrated by this mandatory removal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General. 

Mr. Murtagh, you have four minutes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JASON E. MURTAGH

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. MURTAGH: Mr. Chief Justice, just very 

briefly, General Underwood just mentioned that -- that 

this could be analyzed as a mandatory removal statute. 

But the distinction, Your Honors, is that what New York 

State does when it removes these cases to Federal court 

is it uses an avenue that is provided by Congress. And, 

certainly, if Congress wants to provide for removal to 

Federal court, Congress can do that.

 What the State cannot do is come in and 

interpose its policy judgment over and above what 

Congress has decided with respect to Federal claims.

 Very quickly, I would like to address the 

second point. General Underwood pointed out that there 

are a lot of large prisons in rural counties in New York 

State; and, therefore, there are a lot of cases that 

might be brought in those courts. There is no dispute 

in this case, Your Honors, that if New York wanted to 

have a statute that said those cases will be transferred 

to the less busy courts of our State, that would be 

okay. That would be a neutral rule of judicial 

administration related to the operation of the courts 

that is unrelated to the substance or the identity of 

the parties.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In that same act they 

might rescind the -- the laws allowing the State to 

respond in damages, in which case you won't obtain very 

much.

 MR. MURTAGH: Well -- well, Your Honor, my 

client can't bring his Section 1983 claim in any State 

court because he can't bring it against the employees, 

because Correctional Law Section 24 keeps him out of the 

supreme court. And he can't sue the you State in the 

court of claims because in Will v. Michigan this Court 

said the State is not a person. So he simply cannot 

bring his Federal action in any State court if he wants 

money damages.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I find it hard to regard 

this as a non-neutral law when it was put on the books 

before there were any of these 1983 actions.

 MR. MURTAGH: Well, Justice Scalia, the --

the very first iteration of this law was in 1947. The 

law was actually amended -- and it is discussed in -- in 

the joint appendix and there is some in the beginning of 

our brief -- in the early 1970's after there were a 

significant number of -- of Section 1983 claims that had 

begun to be filed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any substantive 

change from what the original enactment to the amendment

-- the one that's currently enforced?

 MR. MURTAGH: Justice Ginsburg, I don't 

recall whether there were any. We actually researched 

the legislative history and had a bit of difficulty 

going back that far. I don't recall whether there were 

a lot of substantive changes or not, quite honestly.

 This is a statute, though, that the -- that 

the New York Legislature has -- has dealt with over the 

years.

 One of the important things is that in the 

1970's -- and I apologize for not having the exact date 

-- the New York Legislature said that the purpose of 

this was to provide immunity to corrections officials. 

And as we pointed out in our briefing, there is a bill 

currently pending before the New York Legislature that 

says we want to extend the same immunity that we provide 

to prison officials to employees of the Office of --

JUSTICE BREYER: They are saying -- they are 

also saying there is a neutral reason. The neutral 

reason is the State sees there are just too many cases 

in which prisoners are suing correctional officials.

 So then they say: Here's what we are going 

to do about it. First, under State law, we will wipe 

out all the suits and give them instead an action 

against the State. But we know there are still some

Federal cases about the same thing. So what we are 

going to do is we are going to say bring them in Federal 

court. Why bring them in State court? So now we've 

dealt with our administrative problem.

 So that's their neutral administrative 

reason. Now, people would like to bring 1983 actions 

still in State or Federal court. It may be more 

convenient. They get attorneys' fees, and the 

attorneys' fees you don't get under the State law. So 

why isn't -- or why is -- I guess that's the question 

for me: Is this an adequate, neutral, administrative 

reason or not?

 MR. MURTAGH: No, Justice Breyer. The --

the reason that is given in this particular case, if you 

-- if you go through the Respondent's briefing, the 

reason that is given is that there -- is that this 

statute exists because there are lots of frivolous, 

vexatious lawsuits.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, forget all of the 

characterizations. If we could look into the motive, 

maybe we would have a different view. But all we have 

is the statute on the books. And, as in many cases, the 

people who are charged with defending those statutes 

think of very good reasons which are very plausible that 

could have motivated the people involved, and they have

come up with the one that you have heard. Now, what's 

-- what's wrong with that one?

 MR. MURTAGH: And I'm sorry, Justice Breyer. 

The reason?

 JUSTICE BREYER: The reason is, you see, 

there are so many cases in which the person is suing --

the prisoner is suing the prison official that our 

courts are clogged. So what we are going to do is: 

One, give the prisoners a good remedy under State law in 

a different court; and, two, close our doors to the 

comparable Federal case.

 MR. MURTAGH: Justice Breyer, the answer is 

that the State can certainly do that with respect to the 

State-law claims.

 What it can't do is try to shuttle Federal 

claims off to the Federal courts and close its doors for 

a hearing on similar State claims.

 Your Honors, thank you for your time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.
