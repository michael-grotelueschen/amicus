 JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in 

Alaska against the United States. 

Mr. Franklin.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

 MR. FRANKLIN: Justice Stevens, and may it 

please the Court:

 Because title to lands underlying navigable 

waters is an inseparable attribute of State sovereignty, 

this Court has long held that there is a strong 

presumption that each State receives title to such lands 

at statehood. Under the Court's precedents, the United 

States cannot defeat the State's title unless Congress has 

definitely declared an intention to do so or has otherwise 

made that intention very plain.

 Turning to the Glacier Bay claim in this case, 

the United States asserts that it received title to the 

submerged lands underlying the bay at statehood, but there 

is no express statement, an unambiguous statement by 

Congress evidencing an intent to defeat Alaska's title.

 To the contrary, the proviso to section 6(e) of 

the Alaska Statehood Act, which is the only statute the 

United States identifies as ratifying the purported

reservation of the bay, in fact shows that title remains 

with Alaska. Under the plain language of the statute, the 

proviso applies only to a subset of the lands that would 

otherwise have been transferred to the State under the 

main clause. And this is important. In this case it is 

undisputed by both of the parties and by the Special 

Master that the Glacier Bay Monument was not included 

within the main clause. The submerged lands, therefore, 

did not --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, counsel, you --

apparently you agree that the U.S. retained title to the 

uplands in Glacier Bay National Monument under section 

5 --

MR. FRANKLIN: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- of the statehood act. 

MR. FRANKLIN: Absolutely. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And why was Federal title to 

the monument not sufficient to retain title to the 

submerged lands as well without reference to section 6(e) 

at all?

 MR. FRANKLIN: Because of section 6(m), Your 

Honor. Section 5 of the Alaska Statehood Act provides 

that the Federal Government retained all of the property 

it previously possessed with one important exception, 

except as provided in section 6. Section 6 has two

exceptions within it that are potentially relevant here. 

Section 6(m) incorporates the Submerged Lands Act and 

thereby provides that Alaska was to receive title to all 

the submerged lands underlying its navigable waters, plus 

those 3 miles seaward from the coastline, in order to put 

Alaska on the same equal footing with the rest of the 

States.

 Section 6(e) dealt with an entirely different 

set of properties. What section 6(e) did was to transfer 

to the State a very specific and narrowly defined class of 

property, property that was used for the purposes or 

solely -- for the sole purpose of -- of fish and wildlife 

conservation under three designated statutes. Those are 

the State -- local-State fish and wildlife conservation 

statutes. 

Again, here it was -- it is undisputed that 

Glacier Bay is not included within the main clause. 

Therefore, the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- problem, as -- you just 

said that -- that the main clause is very, very narrow, 

and we're told by the Government that no wildlife 

reservation would come within that main clause, so that 

there would be nothing to retain under the second clause.

 MR. FRANKLIN: The Government is incorrect, Your 

Honor. We have identified two wildlife refuges, the Kenai

moose range and the Kodiak bear refuge, that were 

otherwise encompassed by the main clause but saved by the 

proviso.

 And here's why the United States is correct on 

that. They argue in their brief that those properties 

were not included in the main clause because they were 

created under the Alaska Game Law of 1925 rather than the 

Alaska Game Law of 1943. In fact, Your Honors, those are 

the exact same statute. The '43 Alaska Game Law simply 

restated the 1925 law with certain amendments. What that 

means is that at statehood the Kenai moose range and the 

Kodiak bear refuge were, in fact, being used for the 

purposes under the Alaska Game Law of '43, which was the 

then-existing version. These refuges were created in 1941 

prior to the restatement and amendment of the statute. So 

those are two properties. 

And -- and actually the legislative history --

we don't think the Court needs to go to the legislative 

history because the statute is plain and also because 

there's a clear statement rule. But the legislative 

history does indicate that Congress was specifically 

concerned about those two very large refuges. The Kenai 

and the Kodiak together comprise an area that is 

approximately the same size as the State of Connecticut. 

And Congress' concern or, more specifically, the concern

of the Fish and Wildlife Service was that Alaska might not 

be able adequately to manage those properties. But there 

was no such concern expressed with the monument that's at 

issue here because it was never going to be transferred to 

the State under the main clause. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Why -- why shouldn't we look 

to the tests set out in the Idaho case here?

 MR. FRANKLIN: We are advocating the tests set 

out in the Idaho case, Your Honor. That test is a two-

pronged test. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Right. 

MR. FRANKLIN: First, you have to look and see 

if there is a --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Whether Congress has notice 

of the inclusion of the lands and a Federal reservation, 

which it certainly did for Glacier, did it not?

 MR. FRANKLIN: That's -- that's relevant to the 

first prong, Your Honor. 

The second prong --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And second, whether the 

transfer to the State would undermine the purpose of that 

reservation. Should we look to that?

 MR. FRANKLIN: If the Court were examining the 

-- the first prong, Your Honor, I think those factors 

might be relevant. Here, though, the test is set out in

not only the Idaho case but also the Alaska case, and that 

is that there has to be an explicit action by Congress. 

And Idaho applies that. Idaho looked very carefully for 

some action by Congress ratifying the reservation in that 

case. 

Here, we need an action by Congress. The United 

States has identified what they contend is the action of 

Congress, that is, the proviso to section 6(e) of the 

Alaska Statehood Act. That proviso, though, just does not 

cover these lands. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Why do you say explicit? I --

I thought it said you have to make it plain, which really 

might matter. 

MR. FRANKLIN: In --

JUSTICE BREYER: What it says -- the language I 

think is -- or definitely declared or otherwise made very 

plain.

 MR. FRANKLIN: Yes. In the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that right? There's nothing 

that says explicit. Right?

 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, Your Honor, in the Alaska 

case -- and here I refer the Court to page 44 of the 1997 

Alaska case. There the Court said that Congress must, 

quote, explicitly recognize or that Congress had 

explicitly recognized the resignation in that case. So

JUSTICE SOUTER: But doesn't that simply mean 

that if it explicitly recognizes, it has made it plain.

 MR. FRANKLIN: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it doesn't mean that it 

must be explicit in every case. Isn't that correct?

 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, I -- I think explicit --

JUSTICE SOUTER: You don't have to be explicit 

to make it plain. It's a great way to do it, but that's 

-- it's not the only way. 

MR. FRANKLIN: It has to be definitely --

Justice Breyer, you're correct. It has to be --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 

MR. FRANKLIN: -- definitely clear or otherwise 

made plain. Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If I'm correct, then -- if I'm 

correct, then I guess the main argument I thought is here 

we have a national park and we want to keep the national 

parks as the United States, which you'd expect. It's a 

national park. And of course, they want to keep the whole 

thing. I mean, it's obvious. You don't have to write 

everything that's obvious. They no more want to give all 

the water in the park to Alaska than they'd want to give 

the gamekeeper's part to Alaska. A house, or maybe 

there's a swimming pool somewhere they don't mention

either, but it's just obvious that unless there's 

something very special about the water, that the water in 

the park is part of the park.

 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, there is something special 

about the water, Your Honor, and that's what the Court has 

recognized. The water is a State -- an essential 

attribute of State sovereignty, and just to --

JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. But I mean, 

it's like saying we're keeping Yellowstone, but we're 

giving you the geysers. I mean, that's water too. It's 

even underground water. But I mean, what the argument I 

think is -- would be is this like that, and the argument 

that it is like that is that, well, of course, you need 

this water in order to study the glaciers because there 

are forests that go down to the edge, because the flora 

and fauna can't be protected without it. And so though it 

isn't as strong a case as the geysers in Yellowstone, it's 

good enough. Now, what's your reply?

 MR. FRANKLIN: First of all, the geysers are not 

included because we're talking about navigable --

JUSTICE BREYER: I understand that. I'm using a 

funny example to --

MR. FRANKLIN: Yes. Navigable waters. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. FRANKLIN: But let me -- let me just assure

the Court. There is nothing at all unusual about State-

owned submerged lands within national monuments. The 

reason is simple. The Antiquities Act, which allows the 

President to designate national monuments, was enacted in 

1906. At that time there were 45 States already in the 

Union. Therefore, any national monument created in those 

45 States would necessarily have included State-owned 

submerged lands unless there had been some conveyance.

 And let -- let me give Your Honors a -- a 

concrete example. In the 1978 California decision decided 

by this Court, the Court recognized that the Channel 

Islands National Monument, which is an offshore national 

monument off the coast of California, included State-

owned submerged lands because even though the reservation 

order was asserted to have included those lands, there was 

no congressional statement of an intent to defeat the 

State's title. 

Another --

JUSTICE BREYER: Like in Yellowstone. There is 

a river I think. Who owns that?

 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, Yellowstone was created 

before the State of Wyoming and --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. But I mean, does the State 

or the Feds own the -- the river that goes through it?

 MR. FRANKLIN: One would need to examine the

particular reservations and statutes there. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What about in Yosemite? I 

think there's a river down there too. Is the river in 

Yosemite owned by California or by the -- the Feds?

 MR. FRANKLIN: I'm not familiar with that, but I 

will give you an example that I am familiar with. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Before you do that, Mr. 

Franklin, is -- is the rule that -- that we're operating 

under that Congress had to have made it clear --

MR. FRANKLIN: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that it reserved, or is the 

rule that it is clear that Congress ought to have reserved 

it?

 MR. FRANKLIN: No. It's the former rule, Your 

Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the former. 

MR. FRANKLIN: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So the mere fact that it 

doesn't make any sense not to have reserved it does not 

make it clear that Congress reserved it, does it?

 MR. FRANKLIN: Absolutely, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Right, but normally you assume, 

I guess, that Congress does what is -- tries to avoid 

things that are ridiculous. So if they say keep the park, 

I guess the question would be is that included. I mean --

 MR. FRANKLIN: It's not --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- can you read it this way? I 

-- I think it would be relevant, wouldn't it?

 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, first of all, this is not 

the ordinary -- in this case we presumed the -- the 

opposite. In fact, there's a strong presumption. 

But let me give you the other example that I was 

going to refer to you. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MR. FRANKLIN: There's something called the 

California Coastal National Monument. That extends the 

entire length of California and goes out 12 miles to sea. 

In that monument, the -- the lands, the submerged lands, 

are both State-owned and Federal-owned, and they are 

managed cooperatively. 

And that's what we are seeking to do here. And 

importantly, the fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Franklin, are -- are these 

submerged lands covered by navigable waters?

 MR. FRANKLIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is it that the Government 

could do, if they owned the submerged lands, by way of 

protecting wildlife and doing all the good stuff they want 

to do, that they cannot do simply by -- by reason of -- of 

having jurisdiction over the navigable waters?

 MR. FRANKLIN: There are a few things, 

presumably very localized activities that the State would 

have the exclusive authority in. Importantly though, the 

Federal Government, even though the State owns title here, 

will retain all of its constitutional authority under the 

Interstate Commerce Clause to regulate activities that 

affect interstate commerce that --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Yes, but just as a practical 

matter, tell us what you're arguing about. What does 

Alaska think it can do if it prevails in the Glacier 

Monument area by virtue of prevailing, as a practical 

matter?

 MR. FRANKLIN: As -- as a practical matter, 

there are issues relating to local subsistence fishing 

that are important to the State. There are issues 

relating to local uses of the bay. But more 

importantly --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, could -- could you be 

concrete? I mean, there -- I don't know what you mean. 

What are the issues? Can you give me an explicit example?

 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, one explicit example is I 

think the State would prefer to have more local 

subsistence fishing in the bay. And the Court -- to -- to 

move out a bit, the --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So the State would permit

more fishing than the U.S. would allow --

MR. FRANKLIN: I think --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- as a practical matter. 

MR. FRANKLIN: As a practical matter. And --

and there -- there --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But couldn't Congress forbid 

that under -- by reason of its control of the navigable 

waters --

MR. FRANKLIN: Well, if --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if it really wanted to?

 MR. FRANKLIN: If Congress really wanted to, 

Congress could -- could affect activities relating to 

interstate commerce. 

But importantly, what Alaska seeks here really 

is a seat at the table. Right now Alaska has no say over 

anything that happens in its navigable waters which are 

its sovereign State lands. What it seeks really is to 

have its views being considered. 

Right now -- and I'll give you a concrete 

example that goes to the enclaves that are issue in the --

in the next count that I'll discuss. For some time cruise 

ships were going out into the middle of these enclaves and 

dumping their untreated sewage because that was outside --

or asserted by the Government to be outside the scope of 

Alaska's pollution laws and not within the scope of

Federal laws. That was fixed, but it took an act of 

Congress to do that. There had to be an act of Congress 

to prohibit those cruise ships from dumping their sludge 

out in these, what they used to call, donut holes. Alaska 

finds it unacceptable to have to go petition Congress 

every time something comes up on its navigable waters that 

it believes ought to be regulated or dealt with.

 Now, if Congress decides to preempt the State 

under its interstate commerce power, it has the right to 

do that. 

I think we also need to keep in mind what waters 

we're talking about. This is southeast Alaska. The 

waters of southeast Alaska quite literally define the 

region. They are central to the economy, the history, the 

society, and the culture of all the Alaskans who live 

there and who travel there. 

Just to take an example, there are still today 

very few roads anywhere in southeast Alaska, and the --

the towns and the cities like the -- the State capital of 

Juneau historically were accessible only by the water. 

This is an area -- the water in particular is an area that 

is of great importance to Alaska. And they are seeking to 

confirm that that area does belong to Alaska. And I think 

we have set forth in quite detail why --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, there -- there are big

differences between the -- the analysis concerning the 

bays that you assert and Glacier Monument. I think 

they're quite different. 

MR. FRANKLIN: Well, the -- the tests are 

different. The Glacier Bay test involves -- needs to have 

an explicit reservation -- explicit ratification by 

Congress of a reservation and --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: You're lumping them all 

together, but I think the tests are quite different. 

MR. FRANKLIN: The tests are different. 

What I was trying to explain is, in answer to 

Your Honor's question, why this matters to Alaska. It 

matters quite a deal.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But in -- in respect to Glacier 

Bay --

MR. FRANKLIN: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- I -- I mean, is the only --

you said, for example -- is the only dispute about the use 

of the water that's in the middle of the Glacier Bay park 

whether there should be more or less fishing, or are there 

other things that Alaska wants to do with that water in 

the park that they can't do if the United States owns it?

 MR. FRANKLIN: There are two issues. I think 

it's fishing and also to allow more local people to visit 

the area that would otherwise be prohibited by the Park

Service. There was -- but just to assure Your Honors --

JUSTICE BREYER: How could they do that? You 

mean they would go into a boat in the middle of the water 

there, but they couldn't get off the boat?

 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, that's normally what --

what people do is they just visit the --

JUSTICE BREYER: I see. 

MR. FRANKLIN: -- by boats. 

But to assure Your Honor, there -- for example, 

there are no mineral interests here anywhere in the 

picture. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So if -- if 

the normal way of visiting the park is to go into a boat 

and to go up along the waterway and to look at the 

glaciers on the shore, then it surely is odd that the 

United States intended to give that waterway to Alaska, 

for under those circumstances, there would be nothing left 

of the park. I mean, it would be like -- you see, if it's 

essential to it.

 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, that's not true, Your 

Honor. 80 percent of the park, even if one assumes it 

included the submerged lands, is uplands. But it's no 

more unusual --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. I understand that, but I 

mean, it's the way of visiting the park.

 MR. FRANKLIN: Yes, but I just mentioned, for 

example, the two monuments in California. The Channel 

Islands National Monument this Court held included the --

the submerged lands were State-owned. There's no other 

way to get to the Channel Islands Monument but to traverse 

State-owned submerged lands. In fact, I think there are 

few national parks in this country you can't get to 

without going across State lands.

 I think there's another important point here and 

that is the Property Clause of the Constitution would also 

allow the Federal Government to regulate activities on 

lands that abut national parks to the extent that they 

might affect park activities. 

But here what we need is an expressed statement 

by Congress ratifying the purported reservation of the bay. 

Without that, Your Honors -- and the -- the precedents are 

clear. Without that, the presumption is -- in fact, the 

strong presumption is -- that these are State-owned lands. 

And again, there is absolutely nothing unusual. That is 

part of our Federal system. It's the way that these 

monument properties have been managed since 1906 when the 

President first got the authority. It's the way that 

Glacier Bay will continue to be managed. We expect, we 

intend to work cooperatively with the Federal Government 

to resolve any issues that might remain.

 What we're seeking here, again, is a seat at the 

table. We just are seeking to have Alaska's views dealt 

with because they are the owner. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the -- in the '97 case, 

was the area at issue within the first part of 6(e)? 

Because this --

MR. FRANKLIN: Yes. The -- the Court expressly 

stated that it was at pages 60 to 61, and that was in the 

absence of any contrary argument. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It -- it made an assumption.

 MR. FRANKLIN: The Court made an assumption, but 

in fact --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But was it in fact?

 MR. FRANKLIN: I think there would have been a 

substantial -- had that -- had that issue been litigated, 

there would have been a substantial argument that it was 

not within the main clause. But again, there was no 

argument on that point before the Court. The Court at 

pages 60 to 61 expressly stated -- again, it was an 

assumption, but the Court expressly stated that the lands 

were within the main clause. Apparently the Court was 

considering the fact that the application for ANWR did, in 

fact, reference the purposes that were set forth in the 

main clause, the Alaska Game Law. 

The important point of that case for this case,

though, Your Honors, is that the Court embraced the 

construction of section 6(e) that we are advocating here, 

namely that the proviso exempts and saves for the Federal 

Government a subset of the properties that would otherwise 

have been transferred to the State under the main clause. 

There simply was no need for Congress to have expressed an 

intent --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought we had left that 

open. I thought we --

MR. FRANKLIN: I think what I said is that the 

Court embraced that position, and it was actually an 

essential attribute of the -- essential premise for the 

Court's holding. At 60 to 61 and again at page 48 of the 

-- the decision, what the Court made clear is it was 

concerned that unless the lands were saved by the proviso, 

all of them, the submerged lands and the uplands, would 

have passed to Alaska under the main clause, and that was 

one of the reasons the Court, I think, held that it was 

covered by the proviso. No such concern is present here.

 I'd like at this point briefly to turn, if I 

might, to the count I, which is the historic waters count. 

There the United States asserts that at statehood the 

waters of southeast Alaska were riddled with isolated 

enclaves of international high seas that were wholly 

surrounded by U.S. territorial waters. The historical

record, though, belies that contention. 

At least from 1903 until 1971, the United States 

took what this Court has described in the Mississippi 

Sound case, the Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, as 

the publicly stated policy that the waters of the 

archipelago were inland and that the political boundary 

ran along the outside edge. Thereafter, the United States 

took -- consistently based a discriminatory enforcement 

regime, fisheries enforcement, on that position. What I 

mean by discriminatory is that the United States allowed 

U.S. fishing but prohibited foreign fishing in that area. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the argument on the other 

side, as I understand it, is that the -- the assertion of 

authority to regulate fishing really is -- is relevant. 

It has no necessary implication for the historic waters 

doctrine. What -- what is your answer to that?

 MR. FRANKLIN: That's the assertion. My answer 

is that the Court announced to the contrary in the 1975 

decision, the Cook Inlet case, there at page 201 and 202, 

and this is quoted at page 28 of the blue brief. What the 

Court said there is it examined an incident in which a 

Japanese fishing vessel had been caught in the general 

area, and the Court said -- and I quote -- that incident 

deserves scrutiny because the seizure of a foreign vessel 

more than 3 miles from shore manifests an assertion of

sovereignty to exclude foreign vessels altogether and, 

quote, must be viewed as an exercise of authority over the 

waters in question. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: What -- what page was that?

 MR. FRANKLIN: I'm sorry. That's 201 to 202 --

201 and 202 of the Cook Inlet case, and that's at 28 of 

the blue brief. 

What the law was at statehood is that the United 

States had no authority, after 3 miles out, to enforce 

discriminatory fishing regulations against foreign 

vessels.

 Now, importantly there's a caveat here, and that 

is that the law has changed. The law has changed since 

1971. Beginning in 1976, the United States asserted a 

200-mile -- what's known as an exclusive economic zone 

that allows the United States to enforce discriminatory 

fishing, and in 1982 international law embraced that.

 But -- and we have quoted a UN study. In fact, 

the UN study that we have quoted -- and that is noted at 

page 29 of the blue brief. That is the study that's 

called the Juridical Regime Study. It's the study that 

this Court itself, in all of its historic waters cases, 

has used as the authoritative statement of the law. That 

study quite clearly states that if a -- if a country 

enforced discriminatory fishing rules against foreign

vessels outside -- that that manifests an assertion of an 

historic inland waters claim. And what we have here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: On -- on this point, it seems 

to me there -- unlike the first point you were discussing 

where I think the Federal Government can work its will 

anyway, on this point there is really a significant 

Federal interest involved. That is to say, if the United 

States takes the position that these are, indeed, inland 

waters, it's going to have to acknowledge similar rights 

in foreign countries with similar archipelagos.

 MR. FRANKLIN: No. Your Honor, they assert 

that, but they don't provide any specific examples. And 

the reason they can't provide a specific example of any 

instance abroad where it would affect their position is 

that each historic waters inquiry is decided on its own 

facts. The fact that something is an archipelago does not 

render it historic waters. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but you say a 

determinative fact, a conclusive fact is simply -- is 

simply enforcing discriminatory fishing regulations. 

MR. FRANKLIN: It is a claim to the -- to the 

waters, which was made in 1903, accompanied with 

discriminatory fishing enforcement, accompanied with other 

statements in this case, including the California brief to 

this Court. There has to be an -- excuse me --

an examination of all of the facts and circumstances before 

one can conclude that waters are historic waters. These 

ones are. Other waters would not be. The United States 

has not identified any waters abroad that have precisely 

these constellation of facts. So its -- its position is 

basically: we say it, therefore it must be so. I --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it's not the United 

States that will be making the judgment about what areas 

are controlled. It would be the country abroad. And I --

I think the argument was, what the United States does 

other nations will copy. 

MR. FRANKLIN: Right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And they will decide what 

looks like the Alaska --

MR. FRANKLIN: Right. 

What the United States does, Your Honor, is 

follow the well-settled international law on historic bays 

-- historic waters. Those are set forth in the 

convention. Each state will have the same authority where 

its facts and circumstances dictate it. If there has been 

a continuous claim asserted by a nation with the 

acquiescence of foreign nations, then it will qualify as 

historic waters. But it has to be done based on a -- an 

examination of the particular facts of the case.

 And one thing else -- one thing other that is

worth noting, if you have an archipelago like this, a 

nation can always close it off using article 4 straight 

baselines. That is permitted under the convention. The 

U.S. has decided not to do that, but other states are

fully able to do that. 

I think that if the United States is going to be 

arguing that there is some international precedent here 

that's going to hurt it adversely, it needs to identify a 

particular body water abroad that it believes this case is 

going to affect. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why should it make that 

suggestion? It would certainly not be in the interest of 

the United States. 

MR. FRANKLIN: Well, it -- it needs to explain 

more specifically then, other than just stating we think 

it might affect our position. The -- the facts and 

circumstances -- the Court, for example, applied the 

historic bay question in Mississippi Sound, in the 

Mississippi Sound case. I am aware of no instance in 

which that precedent was ever used adversely and the 

United States has not identified any -- any instance. 

But more importantly, what this Court did in the 

Mississippi Sound case is it looked at the evidence and it 

said is this a historic bay or is it not. The Court 

concluded that it was and that was the inquiry that the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

 ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT

 MR. MINEAR: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may 

it please the Court:

 I would like to begin with the focal point of 

Alaska's argument, namely Glacier Bay National Park. 

Alaska's core contention is that section 6(e) of the 

statehood act does not provide an adequate showing that 

the United States intended to retain the submerged lands 

in Glacier Bay. For this --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Could -- before you go into 

that, could you tell me how 6(e) begins?

 MR. MINEAR: Yes. In fact, I think it's very 

helpful. It's listed at page 7a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, (e) --

MR. MINEAR: -- of our -- of the gray brief. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but the -- well -- well, 

the -- the introduction to it is -- is not listed, is it? 

I mean --

MR. MINEAR: That may -- that may be so.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, it's incomplete. It --

it just says all real and -- what about all real and 

personal property? Is there an intro that says there is 

hereby -- there is hereby granted to the United -- to 

Alaska?

 MR. MINEAR: Well, 6(e) I think begins stating 

that this -- these are exceptions to section 5 which is 

the retention -- the general retention provision of the 

United -- for United States lands.

 But if we look at 6(e) itself, it's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you say they're 

exceptions. How -- how are the exceptions introduced? I 

mean, it's incomplete to just read (e) that says all --

what about all real and personal property of the United 

States? There has to be some introductory language. What 

is it?

 MR. MINEAR: No. Actually there doesn't, Your 

Honor, because if you go on, it says all real and personal 

property -- then you skip down, about halfway down --

shall be transferred and conveyed to the State of Alaska 

by the appropriate Federal agency. So it is -- so this is 

complete in terms of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Okay. You're right.

 MR. MINEAR: But if I could walk you through 

those provisions because I think they're quite important.

The first provision says, as you say, all real and 

personal property which is specifically used for the sole 

purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife shall 

be transferred to the United States. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. MINEAR: It's followed by another provision 

here. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: To -- to Alaska.

 MR. MINEAR: To -- to Alaska. Excuse me.

 And it's followed by another proviso which says 

that the United States will continue to control fish and 

game matters in Alaska until the Secretary of Interior has 

certified that Alaska is ready to do so. Clearly that 

proviso is not a subset --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Minear, before you get too 

far, I also would like to ask a preliminary question that 

was raised by Justice O'Connor before. Do you agree that 

section 5 itself, the second part of it that says the 

United States retains title to its own property, that the 

response to that is adequately provided in the Submerged 

Lands Act referred to in subparagraph (m)?

 MR. MINEAR: No, I don't. I don't believe --

let me frame the -- your -- your question, if I may, for 

you. Section 5 indicates the United States would retain 

all of the lands that it presently holds. Section 6(m)

then makes the Submerged Lands Act applicable to the -- to 

the -- to Alaska. In doing so, it recognizes that there 

are some lands the United States would continue to retain, 

provided it meets the requirements of the Submerged Lands 

Act. 

The particular exception we're concerned about 

here is the expressly retained exception, in other words, 

if lands are retained by the United States. This Court 

said in the Arctic Coast case that that provision adopts 

the general law that applied before the Submerged Lands 

Act, that it had to be made plain that the United States 

would be holding onto these lands. It doesn't require an 

express statement. It simply requires that it be made 

plain.

 Now, our view is that these lands would be 

retained by the United States, quite apart from 6 -- the 

6(e) exception we're arguing about here on summary 

judgment. And if you denied our motion for summary 

judgment, we'd go back and talk about the other exceptions 

that are applicable. 

But in this case we're simply focusing on 6(e) 

and we're focusing on that because the Court's Arctic 

Coast decision made clear that 6(e) -- and I quote --

reflects the very clear intent to retain title, unquote, 

to submerged lands, quote, so long as those submerged

lands were among those set apart as refuges or wildlife --

or reservations for the protection of wildlife. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we didn't have this issue 

before us. Let -- let me --

MR. MINEAR: Yes, we did. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- let me -- why don't you go 

back to your argument? You said that the first proviso on 

its face is simply not a subset of the first part of (e).

 MR. MINEAR: Yes. It's an example how provisos 

do not need to be --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not the proviso at 

issue here. 

MR. MINEAR: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The proviso at issue here is 

the second proviso which begins provided that such 

transfer shall not include lands. Such transfer. Now, 

this is -- the word such refers you back to something. 

What -- what possible transfer could it mean except the 

end of the introduction, which says shall be transferred 

and conveyed to the State of Alaska?

 MR. MINEAR: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, anybody reading that 

would -- would think that proviso refers to that transfer 

or at least it is not clear that it provides to -- that it 

applies to every transfer in -- in the whole act.

 MR. MINEAR: I disagree with you, Justice 

Scalia, for these reasons. 

First of all, the such transfer simply tells you 

what's not included. That language tells you -- this is 

outside. It doesn't mean that whatever follows 

necessarily was within the main clause. What Congress was 

doing here, by making clear that these lands were not 

transferred --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What does the such refer to?

 MR. MINEAR: It does refer to the transfer 

before. But what follows here, refuges and reservations 

for the protection of wildlife, they do not fit within 

that -- that main clause. It's obvious they don't because 

the only things that fit within the main clause are those 

lands and real property specifically used for the sole 

purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife. 

What we're talking about here -- wildlife 

reservations are multiple purpose lands. They're not used 

solely for -- for the purpose of conservation. The 

purpose of the first provision here was to transfer 

vehicles, fish hatcheries, other equipment that the State 

would need to enforce Alaska game laws. That was the 

point of -- of that first provision. But Secretary 

Chapman who drafted this made clear in the legislative 

history that what he was doing was drawing a line between

those -- those facilities and equipment that are used by a 

State in its traditional game management and drawing a 

contrast with the matters that would be retained by the 

United States. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Where is the language that says 

that the submerged land that fits the proviso is retained 

by the United States? 

MR. MINEAR: We do not need --

JUSTICE BREYER: What the proviso says is just 

what Justice Scalia said.

 MR. MINEAR: We do not need express language 

that expresses --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, but where is the 

implication in that?

 MR. MINEAR: The implication is that we are 

retaining all of the reservation. And this is what the 

Court said in the Arctic Coast decision. It saw that this 

was --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's -- that's -- it -- I 

mean, in -- in -- I take it in the Alaska case we were 

considering a transfer that did fall within the main 

sentence of (e).

 MR. MINEAR: Justice Breyer, neither party made 

that argument. This issue came up in a letter that was 

written after. The -- the language --

And it doesn't. It's clear that it doesn't. It was not 

land that was specifically used solely for conservation of 

wildlife under these three listed statutes. The ANWR 

reservation at that time was set apart. It was BLM land. 

It was also used for mining and other activities. 

Likewise, the other matters --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the Court did assume --

the Court did assume that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. MINEAR: It made that assumption with no 

briefing, but it did that with regard to the second issue 

that was presented there. The issue that people were 

fighting about in the Arctic Coast decision was was this 

land properly set apart or not for purposes of the 

proviso. And that's where this discussion takes place. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then --

MR. MINEAR: It's an afterthought that simply 

reinforces.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then at best Alaska 

is a neutral. Because we didn't think it, we're operating

as a mistake. It's a neutral. Okay.

 Now, what's bothering me about the case is just 

what Justice Scalia said, that -- that why I -- if I sell 

you all my clothing and then I put, but not my camping 

gear, I mean, I can absolutely see you don't get my 

camping clothing, but you want to say that's a reservation 

of mess kits from some other transfer? I mean, it has 

nothing to do with mess kits. 

MR. MINEAR: Your Honor, but that's -- it's 

clear that what this is -- this is more along the lines if 

someone said that I will sell you my house, provided that 

transfer shall not include the detached garage. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine, and then it doesn't go in 

that.

 MR. MINEAR: In that case --

JUSTICE BREYER: But it doesn't mean that the 

next --

MR. MINEAR: Yes, but it was not a part of the 

house.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MR. MINEAR: You know, that's -- it's just 

providing clarification, just that one of the purposes of 

the proviso is to provide clarification. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is an abundance of 

caution?

 MR. MINEAR: In other -- that is exactly right. 

And we can tell that from --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. If it's an 

abundance of caution, where's the other language that 

almost reserves it so we need the caution?

 MR. MINEAR: That would be section 5. It 

indicates the general retention for lands of this sort. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But 5 is subject to the 

Submerged Lands Act and the Submerged Lands Act brings you 

back to the reservation has to be explicit. And then --

see, that's --

MR. MINEAR: Well, Justice Breyer, again, if I 

can just complete the point --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's why I was talking about 

Yellowstone. 

MR. MINEAR: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I was looking for something 

that would be obvious that they wouldn't have meant to 

transfer. He comes back and says, well, very often States 

do control the water.

 MR. MINEAR: Your Honor, I just need to make a 

point. I think it's very important for you to understand 

this point. First of all, that at page 57 of the Arctic 

Coast decision, this Court was clearly reading this 

language, the 6(e) proviso, as sufficient to provide a 

36

clear indication of transfer of title, and in doing so, it 

was recognizing what is clear in the proviso itself, that 

these particular items that are discussed there are not a 

part of the main clause and cannot be. And a good example 

of that is the third thing that's being transferred, 

facilities that are utilized in connection with general 

research activities related to fisheries and wildlife.

 Now, that is not going to be something that's 

specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and 

protection of wildlife. It's the antithesis of that. It 

makes quite clear that our construction is correct. The 

subset theory just doesn't work because the items that are 

here are not things that fit within the main clause. What 

Congress was doing here was drawing a very clear line --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But why -- why doesn't (m) 

supersede that argument anyway? Let's -- can't we say 

that, well, you may be right so far as the second clause 

of (e) is concerned, but you still have to deal with (m)?

 MR. MINEAR: Then you have to explain what 

happened in the Arctic Coast case, why we were able to 

retain the ANWR lands which did not fall within the main 

provision. And that is because Congress was making --

because this Court concluded that Congress was making 

clear that wildlife lands are very important and they 

wanted to make absolutely clear that those lands would not

be transferred. And even a provision that could be 

misconstrued, as I'm afraid this Court did in -- in Arctic 

Coast -- could be misconstrued to contain some of these 

lands, we need to make adequate assurance that -- that the 

courts that read this realize a clear division is being 

made. We are retaining these wildlife lands. That's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Minear, I'm -- I'm not sure 

I agree with you that -- that that language, facilities 

used in connection with general research activities 

relating to fisheries or wildlife, is not a subpart of the 

earlier -- of the earlier grant, namely property used for 

the sole purpose of conservation and protection of 

fisheries and wildlife. Surely one -- one can readily 

regard general research activities relating to fisheries 

or wildlife to be part of the activity of conserving and 

protecting fisheries and wildlife.

 MR. MINEAR: But we're talking about a facility 

here. So a facility that might conduct some -- some 

research tangentially related to wildlife is not a 

facility that's used for the sole -- specifically used for 

the sole purpose of conservation and wildlife. There's a 

clear difference here. These two -- these two sets do not 

overlap, and it's even more so with regard to wildlife 

refuges. Wildlife refuges and wildlife reservations are 

used for multiple purposes.

 At the time of statehood, the -- the regulations 

in place, the fisheries regulations and wildlife 

regulations, made clear that permits could be issued for 

purposes apart from wildlife conservation. And this 

Court's own decision in Udall v. Tallman recognized that 

one of the -- the refuges that Alaska cites as being 

included in the main clause was being used for oil and gas 

purposes. It was not being used solely for the purposes 

-- specifically used solely for the purposes of 

conservation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Minear, you know, I -- I am 

just overwhelmed by the reality that this is a terrible 

mess of a statute. I can't figure out what it means.

 MR. MINEAR: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and it seems to me 

that's exactly why we have a clear statement rule.

 MR. MINEAR: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: There are arguments here, there 

are arguments there, but it -- it does not dawn upon me 

that -- that anything is clear about this at all.

 MR. MINEAR: Well, this -- we believe the 

statute has been clear for 50 years. That's why these 

issues have only arisen recently with regard to Glacier 

Bay National Park. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Minear, what do you say

are the practical consequences from the Federal 

Government's perspective of going -- of disagreeing with 

the U.S. position? What harm is done? Can the U.S. 

protect itself in any event under other clauses?

 MR. MINEAR: We agree that the United States has 

the regulatory authority to protect -- to limit vessel 

entries and protect commercial fishing, but that's not 

what our concern is.

 Our concern is with the actual use of the 

submerged lands. This is a laboratory. This is a 

laboratory for scientific research, and we occupy and use 

the submerged lands for that purpose. That includes such 

things as withdrawing cores of materials so we can analyze 

its historic features. We've installed a 5-mile cable 

with a hydrophone on the -- on the submerged lands so we 

can listen to vehicle traffic and determine if the -- the 

volume is sufficient to interfere with the whales that 

migrate through there. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Don't you do that on -- on dry 

land in some States?

 MR. MINEAR: Your Honor, in order to hear 

vehicle traffic --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Doesn't your authority under 

the Commerce Clause or under -- under -- over navigable 

waters allow you to do that kind of stuff?

 MR. MINEAR: Your Honor, we think that -- that 

Alaska would have a realistic argument that we cannot 

withdraw materials from the submerged land which we use 

and study. And in fact, I would point out that the park 

superintendent's affidavit --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Are they likely to do that?

 MR. MINEAR: What? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Are they likely to do that? Is 

this a real problem? 

MR. MINEAR: There are 900 papers, scientific 

papers, that are cited in the affidavit of the park 

superintendent. This is exhibit number 8 on count IV. 

And of those describing the type of research we do in 

Glacier Bay National Park --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I thought --

MR. MINEAR: -- scores and perhaps hundreds of 

those involve submerged lands. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Given what you're 

saying -- and I -- you're not accepting this I think, and 

I -- well, there is language in this act which maintains 

in the United States title to the park.

 MR. MINEAR: That is correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, I would have 

thought when you get title to the park, you mean the park, 

and by the park, you mean those essential parts of the

park.

 MR. MINEAR: We --

JUSTICE BREYER: And therefore, if you have a 

part of the park which is the only part of the park where 

people look at the park, and it's the only part of the 

park that brings them into the park, and it's the only 

part of the park where you do the research, et cetera, 

that's the park. Just as if I were to sell my house and I 

list the rooms and forget the kitchen, well, the kitchen 

is an essential part of the house. 

MR. MINEAR: That's --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now -- now, once I made that 

argument, he said that's a very clever argument, but 

really, there are all kinds of instances where States have 

reserved submerged land inside national parks and it's 

worked fine.

 MR. MINEAR: But those are instances --

JUSTICE BREYER: What's your response to all 

this?

 MR. MINEAR: The instances -- the examples 

they're giving are cases in which we've created those 

national monuments or parks after statehood. And in those 

cases, we cannot acquire those lands because they have 

already been transferred to the State at statehood.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It hasn't resulted in a -- in a

disaster. That's the point that Justice Breyer is making.

 MR. MINEAR: But in this case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It has not resulted in a 

disaster.

 MR. MINEAR: But in this case, it is going to 

impede the -- the activities we have there.

 And a good example of this is in the amicus 

brief at page 25 where Alaska does not even assent to our 

authority to control fish and wildlife. The Alaska 

legislature has passed a statute in which it refuses to 

assent to our authority to control fish and wildlife 

within the park. This gives you some sense of the type of 

difficulties that we're going to encounter. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. --

MR. MINEAR: And our chief concern --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Minear, may I ask you? At 

the time the statute was passed, was the national 

Government conducting these activities?

 MR. MINEAR: Yes, it was. It was created as a 

national monument. Now, in terms of what degree of 

activities, the record is not clear, but we're --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe you were monitoring 

passages through to see whether the whales were going to 

be interfered with and doing that sort of thing. Were you 

taking core samples?

 MR. MINEAR: We were definitely studying the bed 

of the lake, and our -- our briefs below explain. We have 

an affidavit from our glaciologist which describes the 

type of research that was being done. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: So in -- in other words, you --

you're saying it is fair to say that at the time of the 

passage, this would have been on the congressional mind, 

going back to Justice Breyer's --

MR. MINEAR: It -- it definitely would have. 

And also I want to point out that when we 

created the national monument, we also preserved such 

things as the interglacial forests. These are forests 

that are left behind as the glaciers retreat and go 

forward over these submerged lands. The glacial forests 

are in the submerged lands, and so they become a part of 

it. As these glaciers continue to retreat, it's likely 

that other glacial forests will be revealed, and those 

should remain a part of the park. That was part of the 

purpose, was to study those --

JUSTICE BREYER: Should. Now, you're not -- how 

far are you prepared to go? You can't go more than your 

brief and your facts justify. Are you prepared to say 

that this water is an essential part of the park?

 MR. MINEAR: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes?

 MR. MINEAR: Yes. Certainly --

JUSTICE BREYER: Have you said that before this 

minute?

 MR. MINEAR: Not only have we said it, but the 

Park Service at statehood said that this is a water park 

when they were describing these lands and saying why they 

should be retained. They told Congress -- the -- the park 

superintendent or the -- the director of the Park Service 

said this is a water park that's mostly -- this is, after 

all, Glacier Bay National Park. 

And in that -- with that respect, I'd like to 

point out this --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why did they keep the other 80 

percent then?

 MR. MINEAR: Excuse me, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why did they keep the other 80 

percent? 

MR. MINEAR: Well, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I gather only 20 percent of it 

is water.

 MR. MINEAR: It's slightly more than 20 --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They should have given away the 

rest.

 MR. MINEAR: We haven't given away. We have all 

of these lands. The -- the uplands here are the glaciers

and the mountains that are inaccessible except by the 

water. You cannot reach these areas. There are no roads 

in this park except for the park visitors center, and 

beyond that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Then make it a water park. I 

mean, you want to say it's a -- it's a water-accessible 

park, fine.

 MR. MINEAR: Yes. But, Your Honor, the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: 20 percent of the park is under 

water. Right? 

MR. MINEAR: More than 20 percent. Roughly 25. 

I'd say close to 25 percent of the park is -- within the 

park boundaries is submerged lands.

 But there's another point I'd like to make with 

regard to the establishment of the park. This park was 

created under the Antiquities Act, and under the 

Antiquities Act, the President is given authority to 

create national monuments, but they cannot be 

disestablished except by act of Congress. Now, Congress 

could have disestablished this monument if it had meant to 

give up the land. It could have disestablished some part 

of it, and it chose not to do so. And yet, that's another 

indication that Congress was intending to retain these 

lands.

 Now, I would like to move on to the other two 

46

counts we have here, unless we have further questions 

about -- about Glacier Bay. But I -- I think one thing 

that I do -- one thought I want you -- to leave you with 

with regard to Glacier Bay is that these lands are 

essential to the park. They are understood to be 

essential at the time that the park was created. And the 

-- the line we're suggesting here is a very reasonable one 

with regard to this park. Those lands are -- continue to 

be used -- the submerged lands for scientific research 

that is vitally important. 

Now, I'd like to point out that the master also 

correctly rejected the claim that the archipelago straits 

are historic inland waters, and on that basis, Alaska 

failed to satisfy any part of the Court's three-part test. 

This Court specifically failed to show a continuous 

assertion of -- of sovereignty to exclude vessels that 

have -- that are visiting the park or passing through in 

innocent passage or to indicate any acquiescence of 

foreign nations.

 During the past 150-year period, neither Alaska 

nor the United States ever attempted to exclude a vessel 

based on -- merely on innocent passage. Rather, Alaska --

Alaska cannot point to a single incident in which we 

unambiguously did so. The only --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Alaska is arguing, as I

understand it now, that the -- the exclusion for purposes 

of fisheries regulation has the same implication as a 

matter of international law, which is a point that you 

disagree on. What -- what is your response to their 

response to --

MR. MINEAR: The answer is in order to establish 

a historic inland water claim, you have to exclude a 

vessel based on this passing through in innocent passage. 

Fisheries is not -- engaging in fishing activity under the 

convention is not innocent passage. And so, therefore, an 

exclusion based on fisheries can never -- can never give 

rise to a claim of --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And what's -- what's your best 

authority for that?

 MR. MINEAR: Well, our best authority is the 

convention itself. The convention makes clear under 

article 14 that fisheries is -- that fisheries activities 

are not innocent passage. Rather, innocent passage is 

merely transit through from one point to another.

 Moreover, the Marguerite incident that they 

describe involves a single incident; that is, it does not 

satisfy the continuity requirement that the inland -- the 

historic inland waters test requires. 

And finally, it also didn't satisfy the 

acquiescence test since the British Government protested

the seizure of the ship. 

And finally on top of that, this vessel -- we 

don't know exactly where this vessel was at the time that 

it was seized. There continues to be a dispute and the 

master was unable to determine whether that -- the ship 

was in -- inside or outside the 3-mile limit.

 Now, I'd also like to speak briefly to the 

juridical -- juridical bay claim as well. This is a 

matter that Alaska did not touch upon, but I imagine it 

would address on rebuttal. 

The master correctly rejected Alaska's 

extraordinary claim that the Alexander Archipelago can be 

turned into two large -- large juridical bays. And 

basically it attempted to do so by establishing a headland 

on an island. Now, that does not suffice the purpose of 

the convention. The only way that it can establish a bay 

headland or -- or closing point is by showing that it's on 

the mainland. In order to establish that this is on the 

mainland, Alaska has to ignore four intervening bodies of 

water. And as the master recognized, these bodies of 

water are simply too substantial to ignore. In the case 

of these bodies of water, Keku Strait is 41 miles long, on 

average 4 and a half miles wide. It's -- simply those 

intervening waters cannot be ignored in order to establish 

that this is -- is part of the mainland.

 It's also separated by Wrangell Narrows, which 

is a 12-mile-long strait that is an important passage for 

international navigation. That too precludes it from 

being ignored and treated as dry land. 

The failure of those two assimilations by itself 

is sufficient to establish that -- that these -- that 

these juridical bays do not exist. 

And even if that were not enough, the master 

went on to say that this would not be a well-marked 

indentation, that even if you were willing to assimilate 

these lands, it's still the case that the bay itself would 

not be -- the supposed, imaginary bays that Alaska has 

created here would not be recognizable to a mariner who is 

passing by. 

For all those reasons, the juridical bays here 

are -- are simply not well founded, and the master was 

correct in rejecting them. 

So what we see --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Minear, could I go back 

to Glacier --

MR. MINEAR: Certainly, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- Park again for a moment 

and ask why the Government decided to base its claim to 

the lands in Glacier Bay exclusively on that murky 

provision of 6(e) rather than to talk about the standards

set out in the Idaho case?

 MR. MINEAR: Well, Your Honor --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Do you -- do you not rely on 

that standard --

MR. MINEAR: Quite --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- of analysis? 

MR. MINEAR: Quite honestly we thought that 

under the Arctic Coast decision, the Court is required to 

create absolutely new -- no new law. It had already 

interpreted 6(e) and it was clear that section 6(e) 

applied to this case. 

We think the Idaho provisions provide another 

opportunity for us to establish it. It's quite clear that 

the purposes of the -- the lands here, the submerged 

lands, are so essential to the park that it's simply 

inconceivable that Congress would have intended for those 

lands to pass out of ownership. 

However, we relied on --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you -- would you tell us 

again why, if you do not prevail on this argument, you 

still go back before the -- the Special Master to show 

certain facts?

 MR. MINEAR: Well, first of all, Alaska has not 

moved for summary judgment. We moved for summary judgment 

on some of our theories. Other theories would require

some factual development. One of the theories that we 

would -- we would go forward with is that these lands are 

occupied under a claim of right, and that's another 

exception under the Submerged Lands Act. 

In addition, we would renew the argument with 

regard to Antiquities Act, that once Congress takes an 

area and authorizes the President to set it aside under 

the Antiquities Act and provides that it cannot be 

disestablished except by act of Congress, we think that's 

a very clear indication of Congress' intent to retain 

those lands. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, given the absence of a 

summary judgment, we wouldn't have to address that.

 MR. MINEAR: No. You would not have -- we -- we 

believe the master adverted to this claim, but we do not 

think that he foreclosed it.

 But rather, I'd like to discuss briefly the 

relationship of Idaho and Alaska because I think it's 

important and worthwhile. We think that this case falls 

squarely within the Alaska Arctic Coast case, and in 

particular we relied on it primarily because it provides 

an actual textual basis for showing that the -- the United 

States retain those lands. We do not need to go further 

and show purpose, although we certainly can. We relied on 

the Alaska case because we think it provides a very clear

example of why retention is -- is required in this case.

 The master agreed with us. He analyzed the 

Arctic Coast decision and he concluded that the -- the 

proviso here necessarily must be considered an independent 

retention clause. There's no other way to understand the 

Arctic Coast decision except on that basis. 

And we think that's the right interpretation, 

and we think if we -- if you focus on what the Court said 

on pages 56 to 57, it becomes quite clear. The statement 

that Alaska relies on to create its so-called subset test 

is an afterthought at the end of the opinion. It's a 

statement that's made in the Court's words to reinforce 

the conclusion it's already reached. It doesn't provide a 

basis for -- for departing from that. And in fact, as I 

hope I have showed to the Court, the subset test doesn't 

make any sense, that they're simply -- all of those lands 

that fall within the proviso are lands that would not fall 

within the main clause. 

The wildlife refuge is occupied for multiple 

purposes. It's -- the two wildlife refuges that they 

point to both the record shows were used for multiple 

purposes. They were not used solely for conservation 

purposes. And in addition, they were -- to the extent 

that those refuges adverted to any lands at all -- any 

statutes, they were referring to a 1925 statute, not --

not the 1943 statute.

 Furthermore, there are 24 other refuges that we 

believe that Congress intended to retain that Alaska has 

no answer for. One -- one of those refuges, in 

particular, the Semidi Islands, quite clearly describes 

within its boundaries submerged lands, reefs, and other 

areas. It clearly is being used for those purposes. We 

think the right interpretation of the proviso is clearly 

that it was meant to ensure, to provide the clarity that 

this Court needs to determine that Congress clearly did 

intend to retain these lands. 

That was the point that -- that this proviso, as 

Secretary Chapman himself indicated, and in fact, he 

stated in -- the excerpt appears in page -- on page 47, 

note 37 of our brief. He stated that these reservations 

-- the land and water would be reserved. He clearly was 

aware and told Congress that that was the purpose here, to 

reserve both land and water.

 Finally, I'd like to ask the Court to step back 

and look at the big picture here. The United States' 

position overall results in a very sensible division of 

submerged lands in this case. We have not contested 

Alaska's right to the vast majority of the submerged lands 

here that are encompassed in Tongass National Forest. 

Rather, we've identified two areas where the Federal

Government interests are paramount. 

First of all, with regard to drawing 

international -- developing international principles to 

establish baselines, which creates these bays and -- and 

pockets, that's a necessary consequence of what our 

foreign policy requires.

 Secondly, where the United States has clearly 

reserved a unique treasure, namely Glacier Bay National 

Park. This park was set aside for the benefit of the 

entire Nation. We think that the Court should adopt the 

master's report in full. 

Thank you.

 Mr. Franklin, you have about 3 and a half 

minutes.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

 MR. FRANKLIN: Thank you, Your Honor. 

To get back to the Idaho case, we are, in fact, 

advocating the principles of that case. It is not 

sufficient that Congress be on notice of a reservation 

that might include submerged lands. Congress has to take 

some action to explicitly ratify that. That was what 

happened in the Idaho case, according to the Court. And 

the United States has identified one statute and one

statute only that it asserts can -- ratifies the bay, and 

that's section 6(e), the proviso. We think the plain 

language to section (e) -- 6(e) is dispositive in this 

case. 

We are operating here under a clear statement 

rule. The presumption is, in fact, the strong presumption 

is, that if Congress does not expressly ratify the 

reservation, Congress is presumed not to have intended 

that the submerged lands -- title to submerged lands be 

defeated.

 There was -- the statute says such transfer 

shall not include. There simply was no need for Congress 

to have included -- to have specified that such transfer, 

the main clause transfer, shall not include submerged 

lands when they were not included -- or excuse me -- shall 

not include properties that were not included in the first 

place. That includes Glacier Bay. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would -- would you respond to 

the -- to the argument that the Alaska Arctic Coast case 

decided that the proviso goes beyond subsection (e)?

 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, my -- my first response is 

even the master, who ruled -- who -- who decided against 

us, did not find that the Alaska case decided that, and 

indeed, it could not have because the Court at pages 60 

and 61 expressly assumed that the lands would fall within

the proviso. Therefore -- excuse me. The main clause. 

Therefore the Court did not hold and could not have held 

that lands that did not fall within the main clause were 

included by the proviso.

 It is important, though, to -- to note this, 

that even if the statute is ambiguous -- and we think that 

it is not -- Alaska still prevails here because a -- there 

is a clear statement rule and a clear statement rule 

cannot be satisfied by definition by an ambiguous statute.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But the -- the argument is that 

it is clear because the reservation without the 

reservation of the waters would be crazy.

 MR. FRANKLIN: Well, it --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why isn't -- I mean, what's --

what's the answer?

 MR. FRANKLIN: We dispute that for the following 

reason, Your Honor, that -- that the -- the point of the 

monument was to study the glaciers and the effects of the 

glaciers as they recede on dry land. Title to the 

submerged lands was simply not necessary for that purpose.

 But I think their sky-is-falling argument really 

falls apart here. All that the counsel can point to is 

the idea is that they would like scientists to go scuba 

diving down there and to perhaps look at the bottom. 

There is absolutely no contention here that Alaska would

-- would prevent scientists who want to study this --

these lands from doing that. We let scientists onto all 

of our properties, all of our submerged lands when they 

have a good reason for doing it. We hope to work 

cooperatively with the Federal Government on this. 

The -- the idea that Alaska is somehow going to 

be less receptive to scientific research here I think 

demeans our Federal structure. We have a Federal 

structure here under which sovereignty of submerged lands 

is given to the States because they are viewed as the ones 

principally affected by the activities that go on there. 

We are not planning on -- on preventing scientists from 

scuba diving down there. By the way, they did not at the 

time of the monument, Your Honor, do scuba diving because 

there -- there really wasn't any scuba diving going on.

 But to -- to move on -- I see my time is up. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Franklin.

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
