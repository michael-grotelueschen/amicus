3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 11-1059, Genesis HealthCare 

v. Symczyk. 

6  Mr. Mann. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD MANN 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  MR. MANN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

11  The decision of the court of appeals 

12 deprives the Defendant of the ability to free itself 

13 from litigation, even when it is willing to pay complete 

14 relief to the sole Plaintiff; thus, as long as the 

Plaintiff refuses to accept full and complete payment, a 

16 putative collective action must continue onward to 

17 certification. 

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did that offer include 

19 admission of liability? 

Or was it just that it was going to pay the 

21 amount of damages requested? 

22  MR. MANN: That's a good question, 

23 Justice Ginsburg. Because it was an offer of judgment, 

24 if the offer had been accepted, the result would have 

been a judgment by the Federal court imposing liability 

3

1 under the statute, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 

2 on the Defendant, and requiring the Defendant to pay 

3 full and complete relief, including costs and attorneys' 

4 fees, to the Plaintiffs. So there would have been a 

judgment of the Federal court imposing liability under 

6 the statute. 

7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if -- if there were 

8 judgment of liability, then that would be preclusive for 

9 all other people similarly situated? 

MR. MANN: Well, I think there is rules of 

11 issuing claim conclusion that would flow from the 

12 judgment, and it would have --

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that -- so the next 

14 case is another employee who claims uncompensated work 

time, and that's brought on behalf of similarly situated 

16 people. Then that next case, the employer would be --

17 would be subject to summary judgment because the 

18 liability has been established. 

19  MR. MANN: Well, there would be a variety of 

fact questions that would have to be resolved to 

21 determine the extent of the preclusion from the first 

22 judgment. But the rules of issue and claim preclusion 

23 would apply. And to the extent those rules call for 

24 matters that were comprehended within the judgment to 

bind, in a later case, they would.

Official 

1  I think the way that I would put it, looking 

2 back to Justice Kagan's opinion in the Smith v. Bayer 

3 case, it's common for there to be a preclusive effect of 

4 a judgment in one case against people that are not 

parties. And this would have been a judgment imposing 

6 liability under the Fair Labor Standards Act, based on 

7 the allegations made in the complaint. And that's 

8 what --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, so what am I to 

make of your transmittal letter which says, in the offer 

11 itself, that -- JA 5556, that Petitioners make clear 

12 that the offer of judgment, quote, "was not to be 

13 construed as an admission that Petitioners are liable in 

14 this action or that Respondent has suffered any damage"? 

What -- what are we to make of that --

16  MR. MANN: Well, let me --

17  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- when you're now 

18 claiming that you would have accepted a judgment of 

19 liability? 

MR. MANN: Well, I don't think that you have 

21 to rely on my statements here, to say that we would have 

22 accepted judgment of liability at that time. The -- the 

23 offer itself has a formal offer of judgment on a form 

24 promulgated by the trial court. 

The offer itself is not an admission of 

5
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 liability. The offer itself is not a judgment against 

2 the Defendant. The offer is a statement that, under the 

3 ordinary rules for Rule 68, if -- if they accept the 

4 offer, there would be a judgment against our client. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How did you pick the 

6 $7,500? 

7  MR. MANN: That's detailed later in the 

8 Joint Appendix, at pages 77 to 79. But, essentially, 

9 what our client did is they took the amount of time for 

breaks during the Respondent's period of employment and 

11 offered her full wages for all of the break time, so 

12 that whatever amount of break time was appropriately 

13 charged for her --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I see in the -- in the 

FLSA, that it also requires an amount for liquidated 

16 damages. Did you include that amount as well? 

17  MR. MANN: Yes, Your Honor -- yes, Justice 

18 Sotomayor. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, what if the 

district court -- this proceeding -- you filed the 

21 suggestion of -- of mootness, whatever, and the judge 

22 says, okay, I have this suggestion of mootness, I also 

23 want to address the certification issue, the mootness 

24 argument is scheduled for three months down the road, 

the certification issue for two months down the road; 

6

25

Official 

1 isn't this just a question of what order the district 

2 court wants to address these two issues? 

3  MR. MANN: Okay. So there is two things I 

4 want to say about that. The first one is to talk about 

what happened in this particular case, which is the case 

6 that's before the Court; and, the second is to discuss 

7 the practical consequences of what could have happened 

8 in some other case. 

9  So what happened in this case is that it was 

uncontested that the offer provided complete relief. 

11 And so the Respondent suffered a judgment to be entered 

12 against her because of the conceded acts of the offer. 

13 And at the time that judgment was entered, nothing had 

14 been done about certification. At the time the offer 

was entered -- had made -- nothing had been done about 

16 certification. 

17  So what we --

18  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it was not possible 

19 for anything to be done about the certification because 

you moved immediately. The complaint is filed, and then 

21 you moved -- then you immediately offered the judgment 

22 that you did. 

23  MR. MANN: Well, I think there is two 

24 questions to unpack here that -- that are implicit in 

both what the Chief Justice is commenting on and what 

7
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 you're commenting on, Justice Ginsburg. 

2  One is the question that was presented in 

3 the petition, which is: What is the effect on a 

4 collective action if, before certification or any motion 

for collective process has been determined, the sole 

6 plaintiff loses the case. 

7  The second one is: How do you deal with the 

8 housekeeping issues of terminating the interest of a 

9 plaintiff when there's no longer controversy between the 

plaintiff and the defendant? 

11  And so --

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, it seems as though 

13 it's more than a housekeeping issue that's involved here 

14 because -- I mean, I realize that you have an argument 

about what happens when the plaintiff's individual 

16 claims have been fully satisfied, but the plaintiff 

17 continues to want to represent other individuals. 

18  But, here, the plaintiff's individual claims 

19 had not been fully satisfied. She walked away with 

nothing. She walked away with no judgment, and she 

21 walked away with no $7,500. And the question is: How 

22 can it possibly be that her individual claim was moot? 

23  MR. MANN: Okay. So I think there is two --

24 again, there's two things to say. One is: We view it 

as a housekeeping question because it seems to us clear 

8

25

Official 

1 that, if the defendant no longer wishes to contest 

2 liability and formally offers to pay all of the relief 

3 that the person could possibly win in any formal 

4 litigation, it has to be the case that the individual's 

interest is moot. 

6  Now, it might be that the appropriate 

7 response is, as is consistent with the Third Circuit, is 

8 that the district court should just dismiss the case 

9 because, if the person won't take yes for an answer, the 

Federal court doesn't need anything further --

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is nothing in 

12 Rule 68 -- you're basing the -- your position on a rule 

13 that provides as the only sanction, if the plaintiff 

14 continues and gets less than the offer of proof, then 

the plaintiff has to pay the costs. Rule 68 doesn't say 

16 anything about dismissing suits. 

17  MR. MANN: Well, I don't think our position 

18 depends on Rule 68 at all for the mootness. Our 

19 position for the mootness is that, if there's no further 

controversy about the relief that is created by the 

21 cause of action, there's nothing more for the trial 

22 court to do --

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, let me ask you 

24 this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Kennedy. 

9

25

Official 

1  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let me ask you just this 

2 question -- just tell me as a matter of common practice, 

3 do district courts enter judgments against plaintiffs 

4 routinely when a full offer of settlement has been made 

and the defendant just is silent? I mean, does this 


6 happen? 


7  I just can't remember seeing a -- but 


8 this --


9  MR. MANN: There's --


JUSTICE KENNEDY: It may -- it may be that 

11 it's common practice that, if the plaintiff doesn't 

12 reply and there's an offer that's filed with the court, 

13 the court says, I haven't heard anything, I'm going to 

14 enter judgment. 

MR. MANN: I think -- I think that the 

16 courts of appeals have taken a variety of approaches to 

17 what I'm characterizing as a housekeeping question of, 

18 if there's no further controversy between the plaintiff 

19 and the defendant, how do we move the case off our 

docket? One approach, which is followed by some of the 

21 courts of appeals, is that you enter a judgment against 

22 the plaintiff, whether they like it or not. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: As a matter of 

24 housekeeping, you could --

MR. MANN: In favor of the plaintiff -- you

1 enter a judgment in favor of the plaintiff -- that needs 

2 to be clear -- in favor of the plaintiff --

3  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. 

4  MR. MANN: Whether they want a judgment or 

not, you say, here's everything you asked for; you must 

6 take it. 

7  Another approach is to say, if they're 

8 willing to give you everything to which you're entitled 

9 and you won't take it, then there's no reason why we 

should continue to adjudicate your case because there's 

11 not really a controversy. Our --

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, here's what -- here is 

13 what the Court said last in Knox last year, when it 

14 said, "What makes a case moot?" It says, "A case 

becomes moot when it's impossible for a court to grant 

16 any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party." 

17  Now, here, the judge says, okay, is this 

18 case moot? Well, it's not moot because I could give --

19 at the very least, I could give the plaintiff $7500, 

but, I didn't give the plaintiff $7500, so she still has 

21 her claim for at least $7500, regardless of the 

22 collective side of this action. I mean, she hasn't been 

23 satisfied. 

24  MR. MANN: Okay. So let -- let me respond 

to that. I think Knox flows naturally from Friends of 

11
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 the Earth, and I think they're both saying exactly the 

2 same thing. And the -- the -- what's going on in those 

3 cases -- and I suppose in the Nike case from last 

4 month -- is this general problem of a defendant is faced 

with a piece of litigation, and they no longer wish to 

6 contest it. 

7  If the action seeks prospective relief, it's 

8 quite difficult, once the case has begun, for the 

9 defendant to convince the court that they are going to 

change their conduct in a way that moots the claim for 

11 prospective relief. And this Court's had a series of 

12 cases and has often not been convinced of that. 

13  In a case that only seeks retrospective 

14 relief, it's somewhat easier to convince the court of 

that. One way would be to formally offer to pay 

16 everything the person could get. 

17  What happened in this case and what's before 

18 the Court is simply if that happens. So what happened 

19 here is there was an offer that was conceded to be 

adequate, and the plaintiff suffered a judgment to be 

21 entered against her on the premise that she had no 

22 further claim. 

23  And the question is, if that interest is 

24 gone, which has been conceded at all stages of the 

litigation, until the bottom side briefing on the merits 

12

Official 

1 in this Court, what's the consequences for the 

2 collective action? 

3  And so what the parties have litigated 

4 about -- because this was conceded repeatedly over the 

course of several years, is what happens when that 

6 interest is moot. 

7  Now, we believe that it is correct that a 

8 defendant, faced with litigation that it does not wish 

9 to contest, can terminate the litigation. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you do when --

11 when you have a governing statute that says that an 

12 employee may bring suit for and in behalf of himself and 

13 other employees similarly situated? Can you use a mere 

14 rule, Rule 68, to cut out what the statute authors --

authorizes; that is, that the employee can seek relief 

16 on behalf of himself and others similarly situated? 

17  Mustn't you give a chance for the statutory 

18 provision to work, which you didn't. By filing 

19 immediately, you didn't allow the normal process of 

inviting opt-ins to occur. 

21  MR. MANN: I think that the language of the 

22 statute, Section 216(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 

23 provides compelling guidance for the case that the court 

24 of appeals ignored. 

In this case, because it's under the Fair 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 Labor Standards Act, the very paragraph you're looking 

2 at, Congress has opined -- and I'll say it's only an 

3 opinion because the lower courts ignored it. But 

4 Congress at least has opined as to how you tell when 

people that are not yet before the court can be treated 

6 as relevant. 

7  And the answer is the non-party plaintiffs 

8 cannot be part of the case until they formally opt-in --

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you have to give 

the plaintiff an opportunity. That --

11  MR. MANN: The -- the statute does not say, 

12 if a plaintiff files a case and alleges that other 

13 people are similarly situated, the case shall not be 

14 dismissed until the court has proceeded to conclusively 

determine the propriety of certification. It doesn't 

16 say that. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose -- suppose the 

18 plaintiff had simultaneously, with the filing of the 

19 complaint, moved to have it first preliminarily 

certified as on behalf of other employees situated; so, 

21 instead of having the complaint, which was labelled a 

22 collective complaint, separate from a motion for 

23 certification, they came together, that the plaintiff 

24 filed a complaint and immediately filed a motion for 

certification and a request to discover the names of 

14
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 other people similarly situated. 

2  MR. MANN: I think the answer to that would 

3 flow directly from this Court's decision in Geraghty. 

4 The first question would be: At the time that the 

defendant's interest becomes moot, who is a party to the 

6 case? And the answer would be: Well, there's just this 

7 one person. 

8  The next question would be: Has the 

9 district court ruled on certification in a way that 

could have erroneously caused the mootness? Well, the 

11 answer would be, no, because it became moot not because 

12 of an erroneous district court ruling on certification, 

13 which was the situation in Geraghty --

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So your answer is it 

wouldn't make any difference? 

16  MR. MANN: It wouldn't make any difference. 

17 What Geraghty turns on, and -- and I encourage you to 

18 look at the portion of footnote 11 that -- the last two 

19 paragraphs of that footnote that goes over onto page 

407, the court emphasizes -- all we're saying here, all 

21 we're saying here is that, if the basis of mootness is 

22 an error by the district court and if we later ascertain 

23 that error, we will not only correct the error about 

24 certification, but we will forgive the mootness that 

flowed from that error.

Official 

1  In this court case, there's no suggestion 


2 that the district court error caused mootness to occur. 


3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I don't 


4 know that you've answered my question sometime ago, but 


what -- if the judge can simply order the two 

6 determinations in a way that certification is addressed 

7 before mootness, does that take care of your problem? 

8  Obviously, if you grant certification, there 

9 is an ongoing controversy. And under Roper and 

Geraghty, if you deny certification, the relation-back 

11 doctrine applies. 

12  MR. MANN: I think that -- that those cases 

13 provide a way to analyze that situation. So one 

14 possibility is that the district judge grants 

certification at some moment after the complaint is filed, 

16 and then later in time, the sole person who is in the 

17 case at that time loses their interest in the case for 

18 one reason or another. But --

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, there's no 

doubt that --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I have --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. There's 

23 no doubt that that -- in that situation, the case goes 

24 forward, right? 

MR. MANN: There is doubt in that case. And 

16
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 we would suggest that it's clear that it doesn't go 

2 forward. 

3  Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as 

4 opposed to Rule 23, which was at issue in Geraghty, even 

after the district judge signs an order saying, pursuant 

6 to Justice Kennedy's opinion in Hoffman, we should send 

7 notices out to see if we can find some new plaintiffs, 

8 if none of those people have yet appeared before the 

9 court and signed into the case, there is still only one 

plaintiff. 

11  So in Geraghty, it was important to the 

12 Court that, when the case got here, although the 

13 interest of the named prisoner had been vitiated, there 

14 were several people who had filed motions to intervene. 

And so it appeared that, at all times, there were other 

16 people. 

17  In this case, by contrast, there's every 

18 reason to think that, after the person's interest was 

19 vitiated, there were no other plaintiffs because --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what do you --

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I ask a 

22 fundamental question under Rule 68? I mean, when I was 

23 a district court judge, if parties told me about their 

24 settlement discussions, I would get quite upset. But, 

it says explicitly -- explicitly, "Evidence of an 

17
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 unaccepted offer is not admissible except in a 

2 proceeding to determine costs." 

3  What authorizes you to use evidence of that 

4 offer to argue anything --

MR. MANN: So, again --

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- especially when a --

7 the statute gives the plaintiff an absolute statutory 

8 right to refuse it at a specific penalty? What permits 

9 you to use it as evidence of anything, mootness -- I 

don't care what you're using it for -- except in cost? 

11  MR. MANN: Okay. So I would say two things. 

12 The first thing is, of course, the plaintiff did not 

13 challenge the use of the offer in the trial court. 

14  The second thing, responsive to your 

question on the merits is, trial courts have considered 

16 this question, have generally considered that the offer 

17 is admissible by analogy to Rule 408, which deals with 

18 settlement discussions more generally, and the Advisory 

19 Committee Notes discuss this. 

And the general idea is the offer is being 

21 admitted for a purpose other than to prove the validity 

22 or amount of the disputed claim. And so --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This makes no sense to 

24 me because, if the offer is for judgment, it has to be 

proof of validity and amount because, at least you 

18
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 have -- you should be able to get a judgment. 

2  MR. MANN: Well, I think that the offer is 

3 not being admitted to prove the validity of the 

4 plaintiff's claim or the amount of the plaintiff's 

claim. The offer is being admitted to prove that the 

6 plaintiff has no --

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But didn't you just tell 

8 me that an offer results in an admission of liability 

9 and a judgment for a particular amount? 

MR. MANN: If the plaintiff accepts the 

11 offer, then the district judge will enter offer -- will 

12 enter judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of the 

13 offer. 

14  The district courts that have considered 

this have ordinarily concluded that, in cases where the 

16 offer is not accepted and the defendant contends that 

17 the offer is complete, that the offer can be admitted 

18 for the purpose of proving that there is no controversy 

19 between the parties, which is distinct from admitting it 

for the purpose of proving the validity or amount of the 

21 claim. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Mann, could -- could I 

23 come back to your response to the question of Knox --

24 the statement in Knox that -- you know, where the court 

can issue -- can provide no relief, there is -- there is 

19

1 no standing. That -- I would have thought your answer 

2 to that is -- is not -- I mean, you -- you answered it 

3 on the facts, but that statement was not meant to be 

4 exclusive, that that's the only situation in which 

there -- there is no standing. 

6  It was addressing just the third prong of 

7 our -- of our standing doctrine, namely the prong that, 

8 where the court can issue no relief, the remedial -- the 

9 remedial prong, that one of -- one of the elements of 

standing is the court has to be able to provide relief. 

11 But there are other elements to standing as well, 

12 including whether there is injury, in fact, and whether 

13 the injury is -- you know, springs from the action that 

14 is challenged. And those -- those prongs would continue 

to exist. 

16  I didn't think Knox's statement was meant to 

17 be all-inclusive, that that's the only -- only way in 

18 which standing can be eliminated. 

19  MR. MANN: I think that's correct, 

Justice Scalia. And so the problem that we face here is 

21 the -- the questioning relates to something that has --

22 was not disputed below. And our position is a 

23 relatively simple one, which is that, under the doctrine 

24 of mootness, it has to be correct that, if there is not 

a controversy between the plaintiff and the defendant

1 about a cause of action that's authorized by law, then 

2 the case is over. 

3  And that was all conceded below. The 

4 plaintiff suffered a judgment to be entered against her. 

She did not challenge that judgment on appeal. 

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Mann -- excuse me. 

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Does the -- can I ask this 

8 question? Does the district court have the authority 

9 when an offer of judgment is made to hold a hearing as 

to whether the offer of judgment actually gives the 

11 plaintiff everything that the plaintiff could possibly 

12 get under the complaint? 

13  MR. MANN: We think that's the appropriate 

14 response. We think that what should happen is that, if 

the defendant makes an offer of judgment and -- and 

16 files a motion to dismiss, suggesting that it provides 

17 complete relief, that if the plaintiff doesn't concede 

18 that the case should be dismissed, the district judge 

19 should hold a hearing, as the district judge did here --

JUSTICE ALITO: But where -- where does it 

21 say that in Rule 68? 

22  MR. MANN: The proceeding isn't under 

23 Rule 68.

obvious --

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, your -- your offer 

7 says, you hereby offer to allow entry of judgment under 

8 Rule 68. 

9  MR. MANN: But -- but we don't think that 

the mootness of the case flows from Rule 68. The 

11 mootness of the case flows from the fact that there is 

12 not a dispute between the parties about anything a 

13 Federal court can handle. 

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But the -- but the 

question from Justice Alito was, what happens, does the 

16 court have authority to have a hearing? 

17  MR. MANN: But the court --

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you said, oh, well, 

19 this is not under Rule 68; but -- but you offered to 

allow entry of judgment under Rule 68. 

21  MR. MANN: And the -- and --

23 never did follow up and say that you wanted an entry of

1  MR. MANN: Well, because -- because the 

2 plaintiff didn't accept the offer. 

3  One course of action is we make an offer 

4 under Rule 68, and the plaintiff says, all right, let's 

have a judgment under Rule 68; in which case, there 

6 would be a judgment under Rule 68. 

7  In this case, the plaintiff said, I'm not 

8 interested in Rule 68. And we said, all right. Well, 

9 now what we see is a cause of action under Federal law 

Congress has created that specifies certain forms of 

11 relief that are available to the plaintiff. And in this 

12 case, there are damages, some liquidated damages, some 

13 attorneys' fees and costs. There is no injunctive or 

14 declaratory relief. 

And we have a defendant that is willing to 

16 give more than you could possibly get if you win. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there attorneys' fees 

18 in that offer? I thought there wasn't in --

19  MR. MANN: Yes. Yes, there were. The offer 

specifically provides for attorneys' fees. And even if 

21 the offer didn't provide for attorneys' fees, they would 

22 be available under Section 216(b) --

23  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But this, I 

24 take it, is a statutory case, not a constitutional case. 

That is, do you have any constitutional objection if

1 Congress had said, in 216(b), that Joe Smith and other

their case as well, though it ceases to be their case, 

6 unless they confirm within 60 days of such-and-such, in 

7 writing, that it is their case. 

8  If Congress passed that statute, there 

9 couldn't be a constitutional objection to it, could 

there? 

11  MR. MANN: Well, I think there could be 

12 constitutional objections, depending on the details of 

13 the statute --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. Do you see 

what I'm driving at? 

16  In other words, if Congress had explicitly 

17 said, in 216(b), that the Third Circuit's procedure is 

18 the correct procedure for Mr. Joe Smith to bring his 

19 case in such circumstances, if they had said that 

explicitly, is there a constitutional objection? If so, 

21 what could it be? 

22  MR. MANN: I think the constitutional issues 

23 that proposals like that might raise would flow from the 

24 decision in Vermont Agency. And the question has to be 

whether there is a person before the court --

1  JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, we know at least, since 

2 we are doing -- I looked up a little bit, but Article 

3 III is what was a case or controversy in Westminster in 

4 1788 or 1750 or whenever, that in Westminster, in a 

court of equity, I found at least two instances. A 

6 person dies, there is no case with that person, but it 

7 remained in equity on the docket until the other person, 

8 the -- the estate, came in. 

9  A woman could not bring a case if she was 

married. She starts as a single person. She gets 

11 married. Lo and behold, the case remains on the docket 

12 until her husband comes in. That's not a happy example, 

13 but nonetheless, it's in point. 

14  (Laughter.) 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I could find nothing 

16 the other way, so I thought of the canon of 

17 interpretation that equity deems to have been done what 

18 ought to have been done -- or something like that. 

19 Others on the Court will know -- but the -- the point 

is that there are instances --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Equity is wonderful.

2 elsewhere, where there is a constitutional objection, 

3 had they said it, at which point our question is have 

4 they said it? 

MR. MANN: I think the problem is, in that 

6 case, there is an identifiable person to substitute. In 

7 this case, it's not substituting somebody for the 

8 plaintiff. It's leaving the Federal --

9  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. It's Mr. Joe 

Smith, if he confirms it in writing. 

11  MR. MANN: The -- the problem in this type 

12 of case would be that the Federal proceeding would be 

13 moving along for a substantial period of time with no 

14 plaintiffs. And the district judge's role would be 

simply to assist the plaintiff in trying to find --

16 plaintiff's counsel in trying to find new plaintiffs. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: I'll bet you equity could 

18 have considered the husband to have been substituted 

19 automatically and could have considered that -- the 

estate to have been substituted automatically. That --

21 that happens when -- when that particular element is --

22 is eliminated. But there is nothing automatic about 

23 discovering some new plaintiff who -- who is out -- we 

24 don't know who is out there.

4  ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

6  MR. KATYAL: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

7 and may it please the Court: 

8  I'd like to begin with the question of 

9 whether a withdrawn Rule 68 offer could moot a case. It 

cannot. This Court has said that Article III's case and 

11 controversy requirement demands both a plaintiff with a 

12 concrete injury and a matter where the Court is fully 

13 capable of -- of providing relief. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'd like to begin 

with the question of whether or not you waived that 

16 argument. 

17  MR. KATYAL: Absolutely, Your Honor. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No -- did you waive 

19 it or not? 

MR. KATYAL: We -- We did not waive -- we 

21 did not waive the -- we did not waive it. We do think 

22 that the brief in opposition should have pointed it out, 

23 absolutely. It was a mistake on our part not to -- not 

24 to bring to the Court's attention the -- the impact of 

an unaccepted Rule 68 offer. However, we do think that

1 this Court can -- can consider that, and the reason for 

2 that is that it is an answer to the question presented. 

3 Indeed, it is literally the question presented. 

4  Here is the question presented as -- as my 

friend Mr. Mann wrote it, whether a court -- "whether a 

6 case becomes moot and, thus, beyond the judicial power 

7 of Article III when the lone plaintiff receives an offer 

8 from the defendants to satisfy all of the plaintiff's 

9 claims." And we submit that the answer to that question 

is no, that the mere receipt of an offer, without more, 

11 cannot possibly moot a case. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that was not 

13 the way the case was presented in the body of the 

14 petition, and I would suppose, if that were your 

objection, that it wasn't received, wasn't accepted, we 

16 might have heard about that, as you -- as you suggest. 

17  MR. KATYAL: And --

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And if, in fact, we 

19 thought we were dealing with a case in which the Rule 68 

offer was not accepted, we might have thought 

21 differently about whether to grant it. 

22  MR. KATYAL: I -- I completely understand 

23 that, Mr. Chief Justice. I guess I would say, however, 

24 this Court, in Lebron, confronted a similar situation, 

in which the matter of whether Amtrak was a State actor,

2 disavowed, as Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court 

3 said. 

4  Nonetheless, the Court considered it and --

and got into the merits of that question. And we think 

6 here, actually, it's an easier case for the Court to get 

7 into than Lebron. Both --

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I have a question for 

9 you, counsel. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You -- you rely on 

11 the question presented. Your reformulated question 

12 doesn't have that feature in it. 

13  MR. KATYAL: It does have the unaccepted 

14 offer feature in the -- in the question, and of course, 

this Court's decision in Bray does say that it is the 

16 question presented as the Court -- as the Court granted 

17 it, that controls. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, there is --

19 from the beginning, you never accepted the offer. 

MR. KATYAL: That's exactly right, Justice 

21 Sotomayor. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What you appear to have 

23 conceded and -- is that the amount of the offer would 

24 settle your personal claim. 

MR. KATYAL: I don't quite think we conceded

1 even that. That's a separate matter. That's about what 

2 the terms of the offer were. And our first point to you 

3 is to say this offer wasn't even accepted. Mr. Mann is 

4 waxing nostalgic about an offer that literally has not 

given Ms. Symczyk a dime. She is as injured today as 

6 she was the day she filed her complaint. 

7  JUSTICE KAGAN: What do you think the court 

8 should do in that circumstance, where a defendant comes 

9 forward and says, I'm willing to satisfy the entire 

claim? What should happen? 

11  MR. KATYAL: If -- we think that, just like 

12 the Solicitor General, we think that, in that 

13 circumstance, it is possible for a court to enter a 

14 default judgment and force relief upon the plaintiff. 

And we think --

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: Is this under Rule 68? Or 

17 is this under some inherent authority? 

18  MR. KATYAL: I think it could work either 

19 way, so long as the forcing happened within the time 

period of Rule 68. I don't think like -- the court can, 

21 like Lazarus, raise this after it has already been 

22 withdrawn. The text of Rule 68 says the offer is now 

23 dead. If they had, I imagine, moved for the court to 

24 enforce that order -- enforce that offer and enter a 

default judgment within the 14-day period, then I think

1 that would have been something that might have been 

2 possible to do. 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What -- what benefit 

4 does this -- why are you arguing so much? You -- you 

will have an entry of judgment in the favor of your 

6 client who is, according to you, similarly situated to 

7 lots of others. 

8  Why don't you just -- if somebody comes 

9 forward, just take them in, go in, you get a check for 

$7500, or whatever it is, you get attorneys' fees, and 

11 you can do that as often as you want. 

12  MR. KATYAL: For two reasons, Your Honor. 

13 The first is, of course, that is precisely what didn't 

14 happen here. Ms. Symczyk has zero, not even the 

$7500 --

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I know. But 

17 that's the fortuity of the fact that she didn't accept 

18 the offer. And we are dealing, perhaps, with a case on 

19 the record, as presented to us, where she did accept the 

offer, if you waive that argument. So -- so assume the 

21 case where the offer is accepted. 

22  MR. KATYAL: And I think it goes back to 

23 what then-Justice Rehnquist said in Roper because what 

24 he said is it's not then just about the individual 

plaintiff. You can't force an offer onto a plaintiff

1 that doesn't have all -- it doesn't award complete 


2 relief because, if you do so, it undermines the 


3 collective action aspect of the claim. 


4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it undermines the 


collective aspect, if she never brings the suit in the 

6 first place. I mean, I -- I must say I'm -- I'm not 

7 terribly impressed by the fact that -- you know, if she 

8 drops out there is -- there is no collective suit for 

9 these other people. There is also no collective suit 

for these other people if she never appeared in the 

11 first place. 

12  I don't -- I don't know that the law demands 

13 that there be a collective suit. If she doesn't bring 

14 suit or if she brings suit and -- and is given 

everything she wants, the case is over, unless other 

16 people have come in. 

17  MR. KATYAL: Justice Scalia, we think that 

18 the Congress has answered that question, at least in 

19 216(b), by providing for both the opportunity to file a 

complaint on her own behalf, as well as for those that 

21 are similarly situated. And so I think that, as Justice 

22 Ginsburg said to my -- to my friend, if you adopt their 

23 rule, essentially, you truncate that process and 

24 eliminate the ability of people to opt in, in any given 

situation.

1  And that -- for that reason, it's very 

2 much -- assuming that we get to this question, that it 

3 is very much like Gerstein or Sosna or Roper in that 

4 circumstance --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Katyal, I'm a little 

6 troubled that you have given up or argue that the 

7 ability to enter a forced judgment is permissible under 

8 Rule 68. There is nothing in that rule that gives the 

9 court that power, certainly not stated explicitly or 

even implicitly, because it talks about an entire 

11 procedure of accepting the offer or rejecting it, all of 

12 it in the hands of the parties, none of it until the 

13 entry of the judgment in the hands of the court and only 

14 after the plaintiff has accepted the offer in writing. 

So I can't see anything but an inherent 

16 power. So, for me, if there is an inherent power, it 

17 has to be under a default judgment because the other 

18 side is saying, I give up. 

19  MR. KATYAL: Exactly. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. 

21  MR. KATYAL: That -- that's precisely right. 

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Let's go from there, at 

23 least with me, and that may answer an earlier question 

24 about an inquest on damages because that is a part of 

the requirements for a default judgment, so that if

1 there is a dispute about damages, that can be resolved. 

2  But my point is that liability is admitted. 

3 Now, let's deal with the Chief's question and Justice 

4 Scalia's question, which is in what ways is this 

comparable to a shared cost, like what motivated our 

6 decision in class actions, that the settlement of one 

7 existing plaintiff doesn't settle the collective action. 

8  How is this similar to that? 

9  MR. KATYAL: So we think that the corpus of 

cases that this Court has handled in the class action 

11 area, such as Geraghty and Gerstein and the like, we 

12 don't think that they absolutely control this question. 

13 I don't want to say that. 

14  But we think that they set up two principles 

that help inform the Court's judgment. The first is 

16 that, when you have circumstances like this, in which a 

17 claim has gone away as moot because the named 

18 representative of the claim has gone away for one reason 

19 or another, there is play in the joints. 

Essentially, you can have a bridge plaintiff 

21 who acts to keep the case alive for purposes of letting 

22 the class unfold. That's really what then-Justice 

23 Rehnquist was getting at in his decision in Roper. And 

24 we think there is a lot of force to that because, 

otherwise, as Justice Ginsburg mentioned, the collective 

34

1 action mechanism doesn't even get off the ground. 

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you -- you don't 

3 accept the argument that I suggested, that is Rule 16 --

4 216, the Fair Labor Standards Act, in saying that you 

can commence a suit on behalf of others similarly 

6 situated, and implicit in that is that there be some 

7 decent interval for you to find similarly-situated 

8 people? 

9  MR. KATYAL: We absolutely agree with that, 

and we think that's precisely the problem. And this 

11 case illustrates it, Justice Ginsburg, because they --

12 we filed their complaint, and 75 days later, they filed 

13 their preemptive Rule 68 offer. And now, they are 

14 coming before the Court and saying something even more 

radical than I think any court has accepted, to my 

16 knowledge, which is even filing a class certification 

17 motion along with the complaint wouldn't be enough. 

18  That is something that would essentially cut 

19 the heart out of the collective action mechanism 

altogether. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why didn't -- why didn't 

22 you file the -- the motion for certification, along with 

23 the complaint? 

24  MR. KATYAL: Because the text of Rule -- of 

216(b) provides for two different processes, both the

1 filing of the complaint and then a subsequent opt-in 

2 process. I suppose we could have done that. That's 

3 what the Seventh Circuit has said to do in a case called 

4 Damasco, but this Court's decision in Hoffman-LaRoche 

says the entire collective action mechanism depends on 

6 notice and discovery to find out who those people are, 

7 to find out and make sure that they are similarly --

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you could -- you 

9 could have done that with the complaint and I don't --

you say you want to get joiners, so why do you have to 

11 wait? Why -- why wouldn't you -- why wouldn't the most 

12 logical thing be to say, court, we have labelled this a 

13 collective action, and now, we want to start the ball 

14 rolling in getting certification? 

MR. KATYAL: Your Honor, that is what we 

16 did. You know, we -- we asked the district court, right 

17 after the Rule 68 offer expired, within 4 days, to say, 

18 please set up a class certification process. And that 

19 process was then interrupted by their subsequent motion, 

after the Rule 68 offer had expired, to say, this case 

21 is moot. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It doesn't matter in 

23 terms of what the judge is supposed to do with your 

24 motion to certify, if nobody else is in the case? I 

mean, isn't that one of the factors?

1  I don't know if it's even a sort of 

2 good-faith pleading if -- if -- you want certification, 

3 but there is no nobody else there. 

4  MR. KATYAL: That's precisely, Mr. Chief 

Justice, why we think the Seventh Circuit rule doesn't 

6 make much sense. To come in and to ask for 

7 certification before you've conducted the discovery and 

8 gotten the names, we think is really not the right way 

9 to go. 

Rather, I think this Court's decisions in 

11 Iqbal and Twombly suggest that you've got to have some 

12 good-faith belief before you go and file a motion for 

13 class certification. And I'd be very hesitant for this 

14 Court to -- to recommend a rule to litigants that says 

go and file your motion for class certification right 

16 away. 

17  This Court, in McLaughlin, I think, 

18 essentially said that it's not about the timing of when 

19 that motion for certification unfolds. At 500 US page 

68, the Court said, "The fact the class was not 

21 certified until after the named plaintiffs' claims had 

22 become moot does not deprive the Court of jurisdiction. 

23 We recognize in Gerstein that some claims are so 

24 transitory" -- "inherently transitory that the trial 

court will not even have enough time to rule on a motion

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you're 

3 interpreting -- I think it's true that we're 

4 interpreting the statute, and -- and I'm trying to look 

at what document are we interpreting? Is there a 


6 different rule or a different -- what -- what rule? 


7  So I could come back to the statute. And 


8 Congress could deprive -- could provide exactly the 


9 system that you suggest. I don't see anything 


unconstitutional about it. But isn't it a little hard 

11 to read this statute as providing that mechanism, since 

12 what it says is no party shall -- no -- you know, it 

13 says what it says in the last two sentences. 

14  How do we read that to foresee the mechanism 

that you're talking about? 

16  MR. KATYAL: Right. I take it this is 

17 Mr. Mann's point, that people who aren't yet opted into 

18 a class are not parties, and, therefore, the Court can't 

19 properly consider them. And I think that's the same 

exact thing in the class action context, is this 

21 question --

22  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, he says the 

23 difference in the class action context is, in the class 

24 action context, you can consider them there, but there 

isn't a specific sentence somewhere in a statute, which

3  MR. KATYAL: Your -- Your Honor, I think 


4 nothing turns on their designation as party status or 


not; rather, the relation-back doctrine, to the extent 

6 the Court wants to get into it and deem this offer where 

7 we got nothing, somehow, they want to deem it against 

8 us, but if it does and wants to get into the 

9 relation-back doctrine, I think it would find that it is 

based on the idea that the cases would otherwise go 

11 away, and that you need a bridge plaintiff --

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why? Why? 

13  MR. KATYAL: And it's a very important 

14 reason --

JUSTICE BREYER: Because that's -- why? 

16 Why, is my question? 

17  MR. KATYAL: The reason for that goes back 

18 to this Court's decision in Flast -- in Flast, in which 

19 it said that, in the kinds of cases we're talking about 

here, it's not as if we're risking a merits judgment in 

21 which relief is going to be imposed against one party 

22 and possibly trench on the separation of powers. 

23  Rather, the worst that happens, if you rule 

24 for us, or if you rule for the plaintiffs in those 

cases, is that the case goes back down on remand to find

1 out whether or not any of those parties can be 

2 identified and come forward. If they do, then you can 

3 reach the merits. 

4  But this is a very different separation of 

powers inquiry than the one -- in the case in 

6 controversy inquiry than the one that the Court 

7 traditionally handles. 

8  JUSTICE SCALIA: It -- it's hard for me to 

9 accept the relation-back doctrine for your purposes 

when -- when it's clear, under the statute, that if 

11 parties come in beyond the statute of limitations 

12 period, they're not in. Their -- their entry is not 

13 deemed to relate back to the filing of the original 

14 complaint, is it? 

MR. KATYAL: It -- for purposes of the 

16 statute of limitations, exactly. 

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: For purposes of the statute 

18 of -- so you want one relation-back doctrine for the 

19 statute and a different one for what we're discussing 

here. 

21  MR. KATYAL: Absolutely. And we think, 

22 actually --

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: I know you do. 

24  MR. KATYAL: And -- and, Justice Scalia, we 

think that that statute of limitations argument cuts the

1 other way. 

2  So the statute of limitations provision, 

3 which is Section 255, says that, "in determining when an 

4 act is commenced for purposes of the statute," and so we 

don't think it bears on the question or not of whether 

6 relation back applies. 

7  Much to the contrary, the real worry in the 

8 class action context -- and, indeed, my friend's opening 

9 line is, "These cases are going to linger forever, and 

the defendants are going to have no tool." 

11  But in the Fair Labor Standards Act context, 

12 actually, it's the very reverse because every day counts 

13 against the plaintiffs and their counsel. They are 

14 incentivized to bring these cases quickly because the 

clock is literally ticking. 

16  And so you don't have, I think, the same 

17 worry that you do in the regular class action context of 

18 one plaintiff, who can essentially save the day for all 

19 of the different -- for all of the different parties. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Katyal, if we do get to 

21 the question that Mr. Mann wants us to raise, you spend 

22 a lot of time talking about McLaughlin and talking about 

23 Gerstein. Those cases were about prospective relief. 

24 You're asking for retrospective relief. Why doesn't 

that make a difference?

Official 

1  MR. KATYAL: We think that it is a 


2 difference, but we don't think it's enough to change 


3 this. And it's for the reasons that then-Justice 


4 Rehnquist said in Roper. 


Here -- here is what he said -- this is at 

6 445 US 341. "The distinguishing feature here is that 

7 the defendant has made an unaccepted offer. The action 

8 is moot in the Article III sense, only if this Court 

9 adopts a rule an individual seeking to proceed as class 

representative is required to accept a tender of only 

11 his individual claims acceptance need not be mandated 

12 under our precedents since the defendant has not been 

13 offered all that has been requested in the complaint 

14 (i.e., relief for the class), and any other rule would 

make the questions unreviewable." 

16  And it's the same point. He is talking 

17 there about a retrospective action for damages. The 

18 rule that we are seeking here is no different than what 

19 then-Justice Rehnquist said in Roper. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do we take this case on 

21 the premise that you would have objected if a judgment 

22 had been entered in your favor for the full amount, plus 

23 attorneys' fees? 

24  MR. KATYAL: I think you should. And this 

is in response to what Justice Alito had said in the

1 first part of the argument. It is not as if we didn't 

2 ask for a hearing. Absolutely, we asked for a fairness 

3 hearing at Joint Appendix page 110 in the district court 

4 and then, again, at the Third Circuit. 

And what we asked for specifically was 

6 review of the contours of the offer. This is at Joint 

7 Appendix page 110. We said, quote -- excuse me, 111 --

8 "There has been no review and/or approval by this Court 

9 of defendant's offer of judgment to the plaintiff," and 

for that reason, we said, quote, "Dismissal is 

11 inappropriate at this early procedural juncture." 

12  So this case comes to the Court having asked 

13 that particular question about the contours of the 

14 offer. We think that an offer that never gave 

Ms. Symczyk anything is one that didn't make her whole, 

16 and for that --

17  JUSTICE ALITO: If I were to -- I'm sorry. 

18 If I were to think that the individual plaintiff's claim 

19 isn't moot until a judgment is entered into her favor, 

but that -- but that -- that issue, was not preserved, 

21 can you give me an analog that I should think about, 

22 with respect to the second question? 

23  MR. KATYAL: Sure. 

24  JUSTICE ALITO: Should I -- yes. 

MR. KATYAL: I think that the best way to

1 think about it is the -- the category of cases from 

2 Geraghty, Gerstein, and Swisher suggest that if the --

3 if you wanted to hold that offer against us, that you 

4 would then say, as Judge Sirica did, the relation-back 

doctrine looks similar enough to the 216(b) context in 

6 this specific area because, otherwise, the 216(b) 

7 collective actions won't work the way Congress intended 

8 them to work. 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, should I assume that 

this is the same -- the case would then be the same as 

11 if a default judgment had been entered in your favor for 

12 that amount? 

13  MR. KATYAL: I think -- well, it's hard to 

14 know how you'd hold that offer against us, in that --

and the way in which you did so, I think, informs that 

16 second question. And that's part of the reason why we 

17 think it is a predicate question. 

18  I suppose that, yes, you could say -- one 

19 path available is to say it is a default judgment now 

that is imposed on us, along the lines of the Second 

21 Circuit decision; and, if so, then, as the Solicitor 

22 General says, at pages 15 to 18, the then-appropriate 

23 course would have been for the district court to 

24 evaluate whether other people could opt into the class 

using the procedures of Hoffman-LaRoche.

13 the hypothetical that -- that, for one reason or 

14 another, the Court can't reach that question. 

And we think Lebron absolutely permits this 

16 Court to do so. And we think it's prudent for this 

17 Court to reach that question first because you can 

18 sidestep and avoid what is, undoubtedly, a very 

19 difficult constitutional question about exceptions to 

Article III mootness and the relation-back doctrine.

Official 

1  MR. YANG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

2 please the Court: 

3  Respondent has never been compensated for 

4 her individual damage claim, nor has she received a 

court judgment favorably adjudicating that claim. It 

6 follows that her individual claim remains live, as does 

7 this collective action. 

8  More generally, a settlement offer does not 

9 moot a claim, if it is not accepted. Individual freedom 

of contract is basic to our legal system, and mutual 

11 assent is always a necessary element for any settlement. 

12 Rule 68 embodies those principles. 

13  JUSTICE BREYER: How does that differ from 

14 an employee who says that he is annoyed for a variety of 

reasons at the employer, and he sues the employer for 

16 his pay -- for his pay for the month of October. The 

17 employer says, He got his pay, I -- I sent him the 

18 check, I mean, he gets it every month. And he says, 

19 yes, but I didn't cash the check. 

Is there a case for controversy? He can go 

21 sue for his paycheck that he didn't cash? 

22  MR. YANG: Well, if you're -- you're -- I'm 

23 not sure what the injury would be in that case. 

24  JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So why is it any 

different when the -- the defendant -- employer says,

1 here's the check. 

2  MR. YANG: Well, there's a difference --

3  JUSTICE BREYER: And he says, oh, I didn't 

4 cash it. 

MR. YANG: This -- this I think speaks 

6 somewhat to Justice Scalia's point earlier on, which is 

7 there -- there are three elements to Article III 

8 standing, and it also carries through a bit to mootness. 

9  One is an injury in fact. When we are 

talking about retrospective claims, there is a past 

11 injury. If you get a payment or court redress, it 

12 doesn't eliminate the injury. The injury continues to 

13 exist. Redressability --

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Now, we have a case if the 

employer, for some reason -- a mistake in bookkeeping or 

16 something -- didn't send the check on time, so it 

17 arrived 3 days late. And he says, ha, I'm not cashing 

18 the check; now, I can sue him. Right? That's your 

19 theory. 

MR. YANG: Well, if there is a violation of 

21 the Fair Labor Standards Act -- and I'm not sure that 

22 that would be a violation of the Fair Labor Standards 

23 Act --

24  JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. He -- he -- it's a 

contract -- you know. He -- he is paid every month, the

1 end of the month. 

2  MR. YANG: Well, if there is a breach of a 

3 contract, that is an injury. And it is a past --

4  JUSTICE BREYER: Even though the -- the 

employer gave him the paycheck. He just didn't cash it, 

6 plus the damage is for the 3 days. 

7  MR. YANG: If I can just finish, I think it 

8 is a past injury. It is traceable to the defendant, and 

9 it is redressable because the requested relief would 

redress it. There may well be a defense on the merits. 

11 It may well be that there was payment. It could --

12 there could be accord and satisfaction --

13  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure I 

14 understand. You think there is a live case, not if he 

doesn't cash it, but I guess, as Justice Breyer was 

16 asking, if it's a day late? You -- you said, well, 

17 there was a past injury, it was a day late, it -- it --

18 you know, could be redressed, by telling him what? Pay 

19 him again? Or --

MR. YANG: Well, no. I -- I guess there is 

21 a few questions. If they -- if the defendant had paid 

22 the plaintiff, then you would have what is traditionally 

23 known as -- and it's accepted -- you would have accord 

24 and satisfaction. It is an affirmative defense in 

Rule 8(c).

Official 

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you would also 

2 have what's usually known as no injury. 

3  MR. YANG: Well, again, I think it's 

4 important to distinguish between injury and something 

that redresses an injury. Redress of an injury, like a 

6 court redress, which is the only question that's 

7 relevant in Article III, whether the requested relief 

8 from the court would redress the injury. 

9  Now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think a court 

11 has to go through the whole process of a trial if the 

12 check is a day late and the employer says, I'm sorry, 

13 here's -- you know, whatever the interest is on the 

14 check? 

MR. YANG: No, certainly not. And this is 

16 what -- what we say is the right approach, although it's 

17 not a question of mootness, if an employer comes in and 

18 throws up their hands in court and says, it's not worth 

19 it, I want to forfeit, I want to just pay the 

judgment -- and -- and by the way, this would not have 

21 the issue preclusive effect, notwithstanding my friend's 

22 statement earlier --

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Could 

24 you directly answer my question about --

MR. YANG: The court can simply enter 

49
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 judgment. It can simply enter judgment to -- to stop 

2 pointless litigation. That's the normal course, is 

3 that, if there is a past injury, it's redressable, but 

4 the defendant comes in and either says accord and 

satisfaction and says that there is no merits claim --

6  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 

7  MR. YANG: -- or I just give up on the 

8 merits --

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or the plaintiff 

says no -- no standing. 

11  MR. YANG: Well, no. Again, I -- I don't 

12 think it's a question of standing because there is two 

13 issues going on. Standing has to exist at the beginning 

14 of the suit. It's assessed at the date that the 

complaint is filed. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And -- and, as we've 

17 said, at every stage of the litigation. 

18  MR. YANG: Right. That's the -- the 

19 mootness inquiry, then. It has to continue to persist 

throughout the litigation. 

21  Now, the fact that you have had some redress 

22 of some sort in the form of a private contract, that 

23 doesn't eliminate the past injury, nor does it mean that 

24 the court could not, if the court were to give 

additional damages relief --

50
 
Alderson Reporting Company

15

20

25

Official 

1  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if you're due --

2 if you're due $100 from your employer, it's a day late, 

3 he gives you $100, and he says, well, here's another 

4 dollar for interest, that, as you said, doesn't 

eliminate the past injury? 

6  MR. YANG: It doesn't eliminate the injury. 

7 It might be compensation for the injury. The injury 

8 would -- once a past injury occurs, it's there. 

9 It's unlike a prospective injury, which can be stopped. 

When you -- when you seek injunctive relief, you need 

11 have to have an imminent on ongoing injury. If the 

12 defendant stops, that can eliminate the injury, and then 

13 you go into questions of voluntary cessation. But with 

14 respect to past injury, it's quite different. 

Now, I think the possibility of courts 

16 wasting their time on this cases is quite small. There 

17 is all kinds of incentives for a plaintiff not to bring 

18 these suits. There is questions of vexatious 

19 litigation. But that's not what we have here. We have, 

in the Fair Labor Standards Act, a judgment by Congress 

21 that employees are to have a right in the -- to -- to go 

22 forward in the collective form. 

23  And as Justice Kennedy's opinion for the 

24 Court in Hoffman-LaRoche recognizes, Section 216 imposes 

upon district courts a managerial responsibility to join

1 plaintiffs in an orderly way. And the -- the collective 

2 action ties in with other aspects of the Fair Labor 

3 Standards Act. The action is designed, as 

4 Hoffman-LaRoche says, to serve the important function of 

preventing violations. 

6  It also says that the -- the collective 

7 action is to be enforced to the full extent of its 

8 terms. These are judgments that Congress made because 

9 they were trying to protect particularly vulnerable 

employees in our society. These are nonunionized, 

11 generally, low-wage employees without bargaining power. 

12 Congress created liquidated damages in order to provide 

13 a strong deterrent for employers to comply with the law. 

14  And also --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Yang, would -- would 

16 you continue with what you started speaking to, issue 

17 preclusion, because I'm -- I'm also -- I think it's 

18 questionable whether there would be issue preclusion on 

19 the basis of a judgment issued with the concession of 

the defendant. 

21  MR. YANG: Yeah. This -- this is page 14, 

22 footnote 2 of our brief. Issue -- there might be claim 

23 preclusion, in that the defendant would not be able to 

24 bring other claims associated, res -- traditional res 

judicata. 

52
 
Alderson Reporting Company

1  But for a judgment entered by a concession, 

2 the actual issue is not litigated and necessary to the 

3 judgment. And so it's well established that that would 

4 not serve any issue preclusive effect. And in fact, I 

think, if it did, it would put a chill on the ability of 

6 people to settle their disputes through offers of 

7 judgment. 

8  So our solution that we provide the Court, 

9 we think, is the only solution that provides a practical 

way to accommodate the very important interests that are 

11 at issue in this case. 

12  One, it recognizes the district court's 

13 discretion to resolve the case in a sensible way, in 

14 order to --

JUSTICE KAGAN: So, Mr. Yang, do you think 

16 it would be -- I -- I mean, I take the point completely 

17 that judgment was rendered against the wrong party here. 

18 But if the judgment had been rendered against 

19 Ms. Symczyk -- for Ms. Symczyk, but -- but the court had 

done so prior to looking at the whole class question --

21  MR. YANG: Right. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- do you think that that 

23 would be an abuse of the court's discretion? Do you 

24 think that the court has to look at the class question 

before rendering judgment for an individual plaintiff?

15

20

25

Official 

1  MR. YANG: In the context of a collective 

2 action, yes, because of the Congressional policy that 

3 gives plaintiffs a right to proceed collectively. 

4  That said, the collective process does not 

have to be a burdensome one. There are certain small 

6 claims, idiosyncratic claims, that a court can simply 

7 look at the -- the allegations and say, there are not 

8 going to be similarly situated people here. 

9  But when we have an allegation like we have 

here, which there is a widespread policy of deducting 30 

11 minutes a day, notwithstanding the employer's knowledge 

12 that the employers -- employees are working through that 

13 lunch break, there is every reason to think that there 

14 is a substantial body of -- of employees similarly 

situated. 

16  And it would be an abuse of discretion for 

17 the Court not to proceed at least down that road, 

18 provide some discovery, facilitate class notice -- as 

19 the Court in Hoffman-LaRoche recognizes is the 

appropriate thing to do under Section 216 -- and at the 

21 end of that process, which could be short for some 

22 cases, a little longer for some, should be, of course, 

23 always exercised in the Court's sound discretion. 

24  At the end of the case, if there are more 

plaintiffs who opt in, then it proceeds as a collective

1 action. If it remains the single plaintiff, the Court 

2 might decide to enter judgment. 

3  Now, we don't think that follows, Justice 

4 Sotomayor, from Rule 68. It simply follows from the 

fact that a defendant is willing to just to pay, to 

6 give up. It won't have issue-preclusive effect, it 

7 resolves the dispute, judgment in the amount of $7,500, 

8 attorneys' fees, costs. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But what you're talking 

about is imputing into this process, a fairness hearing, 

11 essentially, to see, by the district court, to determine 

12 whether this is a quirky case where you entered a 

13 judgment and you don't need a collective action or 

14 whether or not this is a genuine case that requires 

joining plaintiffs. 

16  MR. YANG: May I answer the question, 

17 Mr. Chief Justice? 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Certainly. 

19  MR. YANG: I don't think it's a fairness 

hearing. I think what it does is -- it -- it's a 

21 question about whether there are people similarly 

22 situated. And if there are plaintiffs similarly 

23 situated, the case should proceed. If, at that point, 

24 the defendant wants to pay everyone, it certainly could 

do so.

7  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD MANN 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9  MR. MANN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

11  I think the most useful thing to do is to 

12 address the point that Justice Breyer has raised several 

13 times because I think it's important to discuss the 

14 relationship between what I would call the statutory 

facts and the constitutional questions that they might 

16 raise. And so I do think it's fair, in a sense, to 

17 think about this as a statutory case. 

18  When a plaintiff files suit in a Federal 

19 court, often, the cause of action rests on a statute 

that Congress has adopted. Those statutes have a lot of 

21 attributes that Congress can control to make it easier 

22 or harder for a defendant to make an offer of complete 

23 relief. 

24  They can provide for mandatory shifting of 

attorneys' fees, as this one does. They can alter the

Official 

1 rules for shifting costs, as perhaps the Fair Debt 

2 Collection Practices Act does from last month. They can 

3 provide for injunctive or declaratory relief, which 

4 makes it basically impossible. 

But Congress gets to decide, when they write 

6 a statute, whether they want to make it a statute for 

7 which it --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. That's true. 

9 And so what we would be reading into this statute is a 

relation-back doctrine, which happens every day of the 

11 week in class action cases and has historical analogies. 

12  So I understand the difference you're 

13 pointing to, but why not read that in? It would be 

14 fair, and it would get the job done, that Congress sets 

up in the statute. That's the argument the other way. 

16  MR. MANN: Well, that leads me to the second 

17 point I wanted to make, which is exactly what is the 

18 constitutional problem. And I think the way to get to 

19 it is when my colleague, Mr. Katyal, refers to the worst 

that happens, well, the worst that happens, I think 

21 it's -- it's important to understand what the worst 

22 thing is that happens. 

23  The worst thing is -- that happens is the 

24 case is on the docket of the Federal district judge, and 

there is no plaintiff with an interest, and the

1 procedure in the district court is we should spend some 

2 time, have some discovery, look around to see if we can 

3 find another plaintiff. 

4  And so I think that that's a different 

problem from how the district court should decide the 

6 order of hearing -- of deciding motions. If the problem 

7 is --

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Mann, if this is --

9 if what Mr. Yang just told us is so, then there would be 

no issue preclusion because there has been no -- been no 

11 adjudication of anything. Then it seems to me that this 

12 case falls into a classic exception to mootness, which 

13 is defendant's voluntary cessation doesn't moot a 

14 controversy. And this controversy is capable of 

repetition yet evasive review because every time -- so 

16 the plaintiff's got this judgment, not preclusive. 

17  The employer continues in the old ways. The 

18 plaintiff sues again. This seems to me to fit exactly 

19 into that category of cases. If there is no issue 

preclusion, defendant doesn't have to stop the practice, 

21 can continue the practice, and then every time there is 

22 a suit say, okay, we'll pay the judgment. 

23  MR. MANN: So I spoke unartfully before. 

24 Obviously, there is a difference between claim 

preclusion and issue preclusion. And what I was

1 attempting to say, unartfully, I will agree, was the 

2 extent of preclusion will depend on the issues that are 

3 actually litigated in the proceeding. 

4  And so I don't --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there is nothing 

6 litigated when you have --

7  MR. MANN: Claim preclusion is going to 

8 apply because there's a judgment by --

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Claim preclusion, but the 

claim is, for this period of time, I wasn't given the 

11 compensation. That's the claim. 

12  MR. MANN: But it is --

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then there is another 

14 period of time, and there is no issue preclusion. 

MR. MANN: But in this particular case, 

16 there's no further dispute likely to occur between these 

17 parties. These -- she no longer works for us. There is 

18 no reason to think she is going to work for us again. 

19  The Court has extended the "capable of 

repetition, yet evading review" to class actions in 

21 three cases: Gerstein, Riverside, and Swisher. In --

22 but in those cases, what happened was the plaintiff 

23 sought prospective injunctive relief. The case became 

24 moot. 

If the Court had held that those cases were

1 outside of Article III, the result would have been that 

2 the defendant could have been -- could have been 

3 engaging in the conduct that allegedly violated Federal 

4 law and would never have had to change. 

In this case, what happened -- in this case 

6 and in the cases like this, what happens is someone 

7 seeks purely prospective -- retrospective relief for 

8 something, an injury that is complete. Except for their 

9 attorneys, she would have received complete relief. We 

didn't engage in our conduct any longer. 

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

12  The case is submitted.

14 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
