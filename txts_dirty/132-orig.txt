CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Case 132 on our 

original docket, Alabama v. North Carolina. 

Mr. Phillips. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS 

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS 

MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

North Carolina breached the Southeast 

Compact in this case. Whether you examine it from 

the perspective of the sanctions that were imposed by 

the Commission, or whether you evaluate it from the 

perspective of the repeated statements by the 

executives of the Commission that there had been a 

material breach and a repudiation, or whether you 

examine it from the perspective of the undisputed 

record that was collected by the Special Master, the 

conclusion, it seems to me, is inescapable that what 

North Carolina did here by taking no action between 

December 1997 and July of 1996 simply does not 

fulfill the responsibilities that they had -- that 

North Carolina had assumed, and therefore the only 

issue should be: What is the appropriate remedy for

this extraordinary breach? 

To go to the specific record, just to be 

clear about this, the Special Master says at page 10 

of his report: "The parties do not dispute that 

North Carolina did not take additional steps to 

pursue a license for a waste facility during that 

period." Our undisputed statement of facts is that 

North Carolina took no further steps to license 

between 1997 and 1999. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, the point 

that North Carolina makes is it would be throwing 

away the taxpayers' money to no purpose. That is, 

what is the point of continuing to pursue a license 

when North Carolina does not have the funding to 

continue the process and to open the disposal 

facility? 

So North Carolina's point of view is: What 

does it mean to continue to seek the license when 

they are not going to have the money to get to the 

end of the line? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Well, North Carolina 

assumed the responsibility more than a decade prior 

to that time to take all appropriate steps in order 

to provide for licensing and for construction of a 

facility. "Appropriate steps" in that context has to

mean something more than simply doing nothing, 

declaring categorically that you are going to 

repudiate the agreement, and attempting to extort 

from the compact and its Commission additional monies 

that it is absolutely clear that the Commission has 

no responsibility to North Carolina to pay. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But how much -- how much 

did the Commission give before this? It just did 

that out of the goodness of its heart? 

MR. PHILLIPS: No, it did it with -- with 

the approval of the other States in the compact, for 

the purpose of promoting the ultimate objective of 

the -- of the contract --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and I think that 

one of the best indications of what -- what a 

contract means is the manner in which the parties act 

under the contract, and that suggests to me that it 

was never contemplated that North Carolina alone 

would foot the bill for -- for obtaining this 

license. 

MR. PHILLIPS: The language of the -- of 

the compact itself, Justice Scalia, is quite plain. 

It's clear that the Commission has no responsibility 

to create -- to pay for the creation of this -- of

this facility. That was clear from day one. 

North Carolina, not only in its legislation 

authorizing its authority, but also its governor 

repeatedly saying, we understand that we have a 

responsibility to create this facility, that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At what cost? 

MR. PHILLIPS: At whatever cost --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What the Special Master 

said was, I believe, that there was never an 

obligation to do it at all costs. They didn't have 

to bankrupt their treasury to do this; is that 

correct? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you accept that as a 

working proposition? 

MR. PHILLIPS: I would say that the -- that 

the State of North Carolina would have -- have a 

defense of impossibility if they could argue that 

going down this path would have bankrupted North 

Carolina. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I think there was 

certainly a significant amount of evidence that the 

cost of completing this project was way above any 

reasonable expectation of the parties at the time of 

contracting, correct?

beginning of the process as well. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What -- what do you 

believe the evidence shows with respect to the 

reasonable cost of completing this project? 

MR. PHILLIPS: I think it was reasonable to 

assume that the construction of the facility itself 

would have cost an additional $75 million. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And about a -- an 

additional 34,000 to get the license? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Probably 34 million to 

complete the license. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So -- I'm sorry. I 

misspoke. So over $100 million? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but the -- the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: An amount equal to what 

they had already -- everybody had already put in? 

MR. PHILLIPS: To be sure, but the -- but 

the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And about how many 

times greater than the initial estimates? 

MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know that there were 

any initial estimates, at least that I recall.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- I'm only going 

through these to try to get a sense from you of at 

what point did North Carolina have a right to claim 

impossibility? You are saying that --

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I mean, I think North 

Carolina -- first of all, North Carolina never did 

assert a right of impossibility. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, it did by saying, 

we can't complete this project. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it said it wouldn't 

complete this project. It imposed upon us and 

unilaterally imposed upon the other States to the 

compact the obligation to fund, an obligation none of 

them had -- had assumed under the contract. 

To be sure, they had provided moneys to 

North Carolina with the expectation that North 

Carolina would use those moneys ultimately to build a 

project. But the reality is in 1997, in December, 

North Carolina unilaterally declared that they were 

not going to complete the project and that they were

going to take no actions further -- in furtherance --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So your argument is then 

that they acted 2 years too late. When they gave 

notice that they were not able to go forward, but 

they were going to keep this thing going, so if the 

funds should somehow become available, they would 

have the -- they would have things still in place. 

They wouldn't have terminated the effort. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Yes, Justice 

Ginsburg. Our argument is that -- you know, whether 

-- you know --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if they had done 

everything the same --

MR. PHILLIPS: I think there's an open 

question of whether the withdrawal in '97 would have 

been in good faith or not. That would be a separate 

issue. But there is no question that the one thing 

that a contracting party does not have the right to 

do is to unilaterally decide to repudiate the 

agreement, get the benefit of the agreement --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they told you what ­

- it was totally up-front. They said: Look, we 

can't go forward with this. We haven't got the 

money. We’ll let everything sit, to see if someone 

will come up with the money.

That's -- it's -- you paint a picture of 

repudiating the contract, when North Carolina gave 

notice in '97 that it would have to fold if it didn't 

get the money. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right, and -- and the 

question then, obviously, that -- the legal issue 

that that presents is whether or not a party to a 

contract who is not entitled to expect the other 

participants to the agreement to pay any more money 

or in fact any money whatsoever has the authority 

essentially to attempt to extort that money while 

continuing to gain the benefits of the contract for 

an additional year and a half; at that point, then 

they -- then they withdraw. 

We can debate about whether the withdrawal 

was in good faith or not. But the bottom line is 

there is no substantial difference between the 

repudiation and the complete disregard of the 

contractual obligations. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What were the benefits 

that North Carolina was getting by paying whatever it 

was -- 400-odd thousand dollars -- to keep it going 

for another 2 years? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the benefits of being 

a part of the compact is all of the powers that the

Commission had to deal with other compacts in terms 

of how to license -- not how to license, but how to 

dispose of waste. They got all of the benefits of 

being a part of a compact during the entirety of that 

period. So, you know, it was not in their interest 

to repudiate this agreement or to withdraw from it 

until they got to the point where they were -- where 

they recognized that they were about to be sanctioned 

for their failure to comply with their 

responsibilities. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Were there any benefits to 

the contract at all until -- unless and until there 

was a waste facility constructed? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there were huge 

benefits, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What? 

MR. PHILLIPS: The Barnwell facility in 

South Carolina was disposing of waste and was only 

going to take wastes from the compact States in the 

Southeast Compact. So North Carolina had -- had 

ample access to that South Carolina facility that, if 

it had never joined the compact, it never would have 

had available to it. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: At what point did South 

Carolina withdraw?

MR. PHILLIPS: In 1995, Justice Ginsburg. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so they -- by 1997, 

they didn't have any access to Barnwell anymore. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right, but they still had 

the benefit of the compact's -- the Commission's 

authority to negotiate on behalf of the member States 

deals with other compacts for the disposal in those 

facilities which you otherwise don't have the benefit 

of. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It sounds to me pretty 

hypothetical. And I find it difficult to believe 

that there is an obligation to commit money and a 

liability for failure to do so in a compact which 

says that the State can withdraw at any time. You 

talk about good faith withdrawal. What would be bad 

faith withdrawal? North Carolina simply says: It's 

no longer worth our trouble. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, this would be bad 

faith withdrawal. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Where the State assumes --

accepts $80 million, goes down a path, is not 

entitled to any of that money or to any other money, 

and then unilaterally withdraws --

money? Are you saying the money was misspent? 

MR. PHILLIPS: That's an open issue at this 

point. We haven't analyzed that. That's part of 

what I think what would be involved with the last 

three counts of the -- of the complaint. We don't 

know exactly whether that money was properly spent or 

not. 

But -- but either way, I think it is 

important to recognize that, even if it were not, 

quote "misspent", at the end of the day which entity 

has the benefit of the $80 million? Is it the six 

members of the compact today? No. It's North 

Carolina. 

If the -- if the Federal Government were to 

declare tomorrow, in response to some terrorist 

problem, that on-site storage of low-level nuclear 

waste is no longer permissible and that those wastes 

have got to be disposed of somewhere other -- in some 

other kind of a facility, the State that is -- other 

than Texas, which is about to start one up, but the 

State that’s clearly in the best position to do that 

today is North Carolina. Why? Because they have got 

a $134 million jump on everybody, $80 million the 

benefit of which was conferred by the Commission and 

the compact and the sister States that were a part of

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, Mr. Phillips, I 

really don't quite understand a part of your 

argument. I'm not sure what happened to the $80 

million, and I guess you aren't, either. And if in 

fact -- and maybe it was -- they had in good faith 

used that money to try and complete the facility and 

then decided it's just not worth it, would you still 

be entitled to get the 80 million back? 

MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I think if -- it would 

be a tougher case if they had taken the 80 million 

and come to the conclusion of this and there was a 

finding by the State authorities that this facility 

simply cannot be built consistent with health and 

safety. I think that would be an argument that we 

are not entitled to the money back. 

But what I think you are not entitled to 

do, as North Carolina, is to decide unilaterally that 

more money should be paid, which is not provided for 

under the agreement, and insist on that as a 

condition of fulfilling any of its responsibilities 

under the agreement. 

JUSTICE ALITO: What is your position --

what do you say that the States contemplated 

regarding the financing of these -- of these

projects? That the State that was unfortunate enough 

to be selected as the second State would have to pay 

the full cost, even if it was $200 million, and then 

would -- how long would it take for that State to get 

that money back? Would it have to wait until, you 

know, 80, 100 years later to get the benefit of some 

other State having to finance a project? 

MR. PHILLIPS: No. I mean, well, the 

working assumption is that the facilities would be in 

operation for 20 years. And the reality, Justice 

Alito, is that once you have one of these facilities 

built, given that there are not very many of them and 

they are and would be a monopoly within the compact 

region, you have virtually limited -- unlimited 

authority to dictate whatever price you want to 

require for taking on the disposal. And if you look 

at the sites that exist -- it was true in Barnwell; 

it's certainly true in Utah and in Washington -- I 

mean, those are licenses to print money, essentially, 

at this point. And the expectation --

of these compacts that were negotiated around the 

same time, none of them yielded a disposal -- an 

operative disposal facility? 

MR. PHILLIPS: None so far. Texas I think 

is as -- is as far along in its process as -- as 

anyone, and it's -- and it’s part of a compact. But 

you know, obviously there is a "not in my backyard" 

mentality here. But the -- at the end of the day, 

the fundamental question remains, you know, what --

who bears the responsibility? 

North Carolina -- it wasn't as though North 

Carolina was the unfortunate recipient of this 

particular decision and then said, you know, we don't 

want to do this, we can't pay for this, there’s no 

way we can accomplish this. North Carolina, after 

having been designated as the host State, 

affirmatively passed legislation accepting that 

responsibility and committing the State to actually 

providing for a facility. 

Now, Justice Stevens, I agree, if it had 

turned out that as a matter of public health and 

safety -- that's the big bugaboo here -- if that had 

been an obstacle, or maybe, Justice Sotomayor, if the 

expense had been so far out of the range of what's 

conceivable, maybe there’s an impossibility element

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and they looked and

the one that says once the facility is completed --

you have to give notice, four-year notice.

there is nothing express in the contract, in the 

compact, that would prevent them from doing that. I 

do think there is an implied duty of good faith. But 

in the situation you pose, Your Honor, I don't think 

there’s any question that they acted in good faith.

contract carries with it an implied duty of good 

faith and fair dealing. You may remember that 

opinion. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Then how do you -- what is 

-- is that absolutely necessary? Any party State may 

withdraw from the compact by enacting a law repealing 

the compact. That sentence seems to me your toughest 

point because that's what they did. They simply 

withdrew. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, where in the contract 

is it something that says -- I mean, maybe that was 

foolish, to put that in there, but they did put it 

in. And so how do you deal with that sentence, which 

is one that Justice Scalia brought up in his --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the only -- the only 

argument we have with respect to that -- and it's

important to recognize, we don't have to win this 

issue in order to win the breach of contract claim in 

this particular case. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well -- all right. Well, 

go ahead, explain. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, because there’s 

massive repudiation long before the -- the question 

still is, what do you do with 1997 to 1999? Before 

they withdraw, they have repudiated the agreement. 

They have breached it totally. The very essence of 

the agreement was lost once North Carolina refused to 

take any steps, much less appropriate steps. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there in this implicit 

that the State of North Carolina, prior to their 

withdrawal, while they are still acting, will 

appropriate reasonable amounts of money for this? 

MR. PHILLIPS: And take -- well, what they 

are supposed to do is take appropriate steps to 

license, which means --

JUSTICE BREYER: Do appropriate steps 

include --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- continue to do what's 

necessary to get a license.

treaty and absolutely ratified, I suppose that if 

Congress decides not to lend and won't appropriate 

the money to do it, we are in breach of the treaty. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And I assume if there is a 

similar agreement here and North Carolina's 

legislature doesn't appropriate any money for 

whatever internal reasons, North Carolina is in 

breach of the treaty. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Do I understand this 

correctly? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, that's absolutely 

right, Justice Breyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any authority for 

the proposition that when a legislature does not 

appropriate the money that the executive of a State 

has committed to another State, that State is in 

breach, irrespective of whose fault it is within the 

State? 

MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know that there is 

specific authority for that proposition. But, 

Justice Breyer, it seems to me what you describe 

there is exquisitely close to what this -- what this 

Court resolved in Mobil Oil Exploration, where

Congress passed a statute saying that the 

administrative side would not be permitted to go 

forward, and this Court said that action constituted 

a repudiation of the underlying obligation, even 

though it was far from clear that there would ever be 

any exploration or production of oil on this -- on 

the outer continental shelf sites that were in there. 

This Court said that when -- that if an 

obligor will commit a breach that would of itself 

give the obligee a claim for damages for total 

breach, so that it so substantially impairs the value 

of the contract, and the government said it would 

break or did break an important contractual promise, 

impairing the value of the contract, then the 

government must give the companies back the money. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So this case then 

boils down to, am I correct, in the years prior to 

their withdrawal, did they take the steps, 

appropriate steps, that this contract obliges them to 

make? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, I think that's a fair ­

-

JUSTICE BREYER: And you say they did not? 

MR. PHILLIPS: But we have other arguments, 

obviously, but then -- but on the breach --

that the United States entered into in Mobil 

Exploration.

around page 400. I will get that for you, Justice 

Breyer. 

But the specific finding is that North 

Carolina had a duty to go forward and -- and stopped 

completely. It repudiated. 

In addition to that, when North Carolina 

announced that it was shutting down the project and 

that it was not going forward, that it was just going 

to run out and wait and hope, frankly, that 

additional funding would come forward, the -- the 

compact -- the director of the compact specifically 

wrote to the governor twice, saying: These are acts 

in repudiation and in violation of the agreement; it 

is your responsibility. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they also -- you 

said -- you said in your brief that the -- in 1997, 

the Commission came forward with some kind of 

additional funding proposal, which North Carolina 

came down -- turned down. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Refused, right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What -- what was that? 

MR. PHILLIPS: The basic proposal -- the 

draft memorandum of understanding would have -- would 

have led to the Commission providing, I think, about

Carolina turn it down?

provide us with any explanation for why they didn't ­

- why they turned that down. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you say there was a 

package, that there was a -- an offer in place where 

the Commission would pay X and the generators would 

kick in an additional amount as well. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And that would have 

been a loan for the future.

MR. PHILLIPS: Because the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Once again, they are just 

tender-hearted? I mean, even though North Carolina 

had an obligation to fund all of it? They just come 

forward and say: Yes, extort us. I mean, I --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, you know, when you --

when you've got the power to extort, you know, the 

temptation to go down that path, Justice Scalia, is 

obviously pretty strong. And the reason they did it 

was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I suggest it's not the 

power to extort; it's the power to withdraw. And 

that power to withdraw suggests that there is no 

absolute obligation to come up with the funding. The 

two seem to me so -- so inconsistent with -- with one 

another. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the difficulty --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So long as you can 

withdraw at any time --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would your position 

be the -- be the same if it were $20 million? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, our position would be 

exactly the same. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So whatever the 

Commission contributed? In other words, it doesn't 

have to be enough to trigger an obligation on the 

part of North Carolina to move forward. I assume 

there is some level where you would say, you know, 

they took their chances, and it didn't work out -- as 

opposed to they obviously committed in light of the 

money they accepted. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the answer to 

your question is -- you know, of course, is: What's 

the appropriate remedy for the particular breach in 

any given case? In this context, if we were talking 

about a couple thousand dollars --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I don't think 

so. I think it's a question of whether there's a 

breach. I would say that if you gave them $1 

million, you should not view that as: Well, we've 

supported your efforts; you are committed to do this, 

no matter how much it costs, because we have given 

you $1 million.

It seems to me at some point the amount 

becomes pertinent in assessing whether you have a 

claim. 

MR. PHILLIPS: But I -- well, I think the 

ultimate question is still: What is the obligation? 

And Justice Breyer identified it, I think, quite 

precisely. And again, this is only with respect to 

count 2 in that breach claim. 

But our argument there is that they had a 

responsibility from December 1997 until July of 1999 

to take appropriate steps. And they massively 

repudiated that obligation and repudiated the 

entirety of --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My -- my problem 

remains --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- of the contract. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- with that answer, is 

that you earlier said that they could -- forgetting 

if they didn't take any money -- under the terms of 

this compact -- and Justice Scalia has been noting 

this repeatedly -- have withdrawn at any time because 

they didn't want to sink any more money into this 

project; is that correct? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Subject to what I 

would think was a duty of good faith, they could have

done that. But they didn't do that. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, let's put aside 

that duty of good faith --

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because with that 

duty of good faith, you're suggesting that merely 

because they took a million -- that's what the Chief 

Justice is asking you -- or 80 million, that that 

somehow converted or changed the express terms of the 

contract and bound them in some way to find funding 

that they chose not to. That -- that's really the 

argument I'm hearing you make. 

MR. PHILLIPS: No, I think it's more subtle 

than that, Justice Sotomayor. I mean, my point is 

they always had an obligation to take appropriate 

steps to get licensed. That was an obligation that 

lasted until they withdrew. And from -- from 

December 1997 on, they refused to take any steps 

toward getting a license. And we don't know today 

whether something could have happened in that year 

and a half that might have changed the entire dynamic 

of this and allowed it to in fact be completed in a 

way that all of the parties would have been satisfied 

with.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any factual

Master to address the legal questions that have been 

presented? And I see the legal questions as whether 

or not, in fact, the claim belongs to the Commission 

or to the States for the $80 million and the $10 

million in lost revenue. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there any factual 

development that needs to occur, or is that a pure 

legal question based on the arguments that are 

contained in the briefs before us? 

MR. PHILLIPS: I think it's a pure legal 

argument. I think we have put forward everything

record that shows that the claims of the States are

based on any particular party. They list the parties 

and they list the claims, and there is no effort to 

mix and match as between them. In terms --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that it's 

the obligation of the Commission to show that there 

is an absolute parallel between the claims. And I 

just don't see where I can infer from the record or 

conclude that that is the case. And if -- and if 

that is not so, then the Commission is not like the 

Indian tribes in the Arizona case. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I would think at a 

minimum we are very much like the private oil 

companies in the Maryland v. Louisiana case, in any 

event, where, you know, the claims were out there; it 

was far from clear exactly how those claims were 

going to play out in one way or another. And this 

Court didn't sit down and say: We have to sort that 

out ahead of going forward with the litigation. What 

the Court said was: These all look to be pretty 

close and there’s no basis on which to assume that 

they are doing more -- that they are asking for more, 

and therefore there’s no Eleventh Amendment problem. 

And, of course, remember the Special Master 

has held open the possibility that if for some reason 

the claims of the Commission were to deviate from the

claims of -- of any of the compact States, which as 

far as I can tell to this point they have -- they 

have not deviated one iota, then the Special Master 

would allow North Carolina to revisit -- to renew its 

motion at that point. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't there an 

obligation before we exercise original jurisdiction 

to ensure that there is at least a potential viable 

claim by the States that they have a cause of action? 

I mean, that then becomes a legal question. Is the 

compact -- is the Commission an agent?

revenues?

for leave to file stage and then before the Special 

Master, primarily on the issues that were addressed 

in the Special Master's preliminary report, which go 

to questions of the assertion of Eleventh Amendment 

immunity in original actions as well as the structure 

of the compact and the compact's power to assess 

monetary sanctions itself. 

Today we make two principal arguments: 

one, that the Court should deny North Carolina's 

motion to dismiss the Commission as a party, 

rejecting at this time or for the time being the 

assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity; and second, 

that the Court should deny the claim that the 

Commission has the power itself to impose monetary 

sanctions under article 7(F). 

That’s not to say that the States party may 

not seek monetary relief, appropriate monetary 

relief, themselves in an original action in this 

Court. It's only to say that the compact Commission 

is not a forum established by the compact itself, 

which is not only a compact between the States, but 

an Act of Congress, to do that.

the policy advantage of the rule you are proposing

the Commission in this original action, of us 

proceeding to answer substantive questions about the

addressing initially the right of the Commission to 

bring this action as an original action at all? 

It seems to be putting the cart before the 

horse, or -- because I'm not sure why we should be 

reaching the merits, deciding the merits, before 

identifying which are the parties and what claims 

they have before us. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I, think, as Mr. 

Phillips suggested, this Court's decision in -- in 

the United States v. Georgia establishes the Court is 

not required to, and in some circumstances it -- it 

may be possible to dispose of the case on -- on the 

merits because the plaintiff States in this case I 

think undoubtedly have a cause --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this one won't. 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the plaintiff States 

undoubtedly have a cause of action for breach of the 

compact. They are parties to the compact, and as 

parties to the compact, they can bring an action 

whether or not the Commission is properly before --

before the Court. And the question of whether the --

North Carolina violated the compact therefore can be

If this Court were to agree with the 

Special Master that there was no violation of the 

compact, then the question of whether the Commission 

could be -- could also bring that claim and what --

what remedy there might be for that, either to the 

States or to the Commission, would never have to be ­

- to be reached. So there is, I think, some 

efficiency with -- with respect to that. 

But on the Eleventh Amendment question --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do we have -- Mr. 

Kneedler --

MR. KNEEDLER: I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Kneedler, do we have 

any decision that deals with the standing of a 

commission to sue a State in its own right? Or this 

is a novel question? 

MR. KNEEDLER: This is -- this is a novel 

question as -- as far as I -- as far as I am aware. 

And -- and that may be one reason why the Court would 

prefer not to specifically address the question. But

of Eleventh Amendment immunity, that this Court's 

decision in Arizona v. California, at least at this 

stage of the case, is dispositive. Because there the 

Court concluded that the States -- because the United 

States had intervened, they had no assertion of 

Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to the 

subject matter of the dispute. As the Court put it, 

the tribes are not bringing any new claims or issues 

before the Court, and therefore the judicial power of 

this Court would not be enlarged and the State's 

sovereign immunity would not be compromised by the 

Indian tribes' participation in the case. 

We think that’s an important principle, at 

least with respect to Indian tribes, who this Court 

recognized in Arizona --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But here the Commission 

is seeking sums for itself. What assurance do we 

have that the Commission, if it received the money, 

would give it back to the States exactly in the ratio 

the States demand it? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- I don't think the 

Court --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I think it's their 

obligation to show the complete parallel between --

between the claims, and that that has not been done.

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, two things about that. 

In Maryland v. Louisiana, which was a suit brought by 

a number of States to challenge a -- a Louisiana tax 

on Commerce Clause grounds, that case went forward on 

the suit of the -- of those States, but the natural 

gas companies who paid the tax were permitted to 

intervene, and the Court did that, notwithstanding 

the Eleventh Amendment. Surely, the claim of the 

States parens patriae was not identical to the claims 

of the individual natural gas companies to get a 

refund on their own behalf, but the Court nonetheless 

allowed them to intervene, and the Court's judgment 

in this case awarded -- required the State of 

Louisiana to make refunds to -- to all taxpayers. 

So I -- I don't think -- especially in an 

original action where the State has a certain parens 

patriae responsibility, I don't think that the claims 

have to be identical in the precise way that they 

were in -- in Arizona v. California. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kneedler, can I ask 

you sort of a basic question about the Eleventh 

Amendment argument? You -- you framed it entirely in 

terms of the Eleventh Amendment, but is there not 

also a common law immunity that the States can plead 

against non-sovereigns?

the precise terms of the Eleventh Amendment. It 

would depend on whether the compact Commission is 

regarded as a citizen of another State, which I think 

it would not be. But, yes, it would be the -- the 

principle recognized in Alden. But I -- the 

principles that I am describing here I think would 

apply equally to that immunity, as they would to the 

other --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why is it -- to go back to 

the word "sanctions," when I read the word 

"sanctions" in the law, the thing that comes to my 

mind first and foremost is the money, like a fine; 

and sort of second, imprisonment. But paying a fine, 

that -- that seems to me the most primitive and basic 

sanction of anything. And -- and why -- and 

particularly, if you say the fine was limited to 

giving back money you previously took. 

So, why wouldn't you read this clause here 

which says "including" -- and then it doesn't mention 

money, but it includes some other things, and you say 

well, sure, they include the other things because the 

word "sanction" doesn't automatically call to mind 

those other things, but it does automatically call to

mind a fine. 

MR. KNEEDLER: There -- there are several 

points that I think are important to bear in mind 

with this. I think this Court has always recognized 

that monetary liability on the part of a State is 

distinct from prospective relief, and I think the 

Court should not lightly assume that States have 

agreed to have a nonjudicial forum, like a --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, are we supposed to --

are we supposed to treat compacts among States as if 

we are dealing with those who want to impose 

obligations on the States? 

MR. KNEEDLER: No, but --

JUSTICE BREYER: Here, aren't we trying to 

say what obligations did the States themselves want 

to impose on themselves? 

MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, and as we point out in 

pages 26 and 27 of our -- of our brief, there were 

three -- it’s actually four compacts that were 

adopted or approved in the very same Act of Congress 

which specifically provide for monetary sanctions --

or monetary -- monetary remedies, which shows that 

the compacting parties knew how to do it when they 

wanted to. 

But beyond that, I think it's important to

look at the overall structure of article 7, where the 

sanctions power appears. First of all, article 7(F), 

which is on page 19a of the blue brief, refers to any 

party State which fails to comply, et cetera, "may be 

subject to sanctions, including suspension of rights 

under the compact and revocation." 

Those are all forward-looking sanctions. 

But -- but I think what really reinforces that is if 

you look at the title of article 7, which is on page 

17a, it says -- it deals with eligible parties, 

withdrawal, revocation, entry into force, and 

termination. Article 7 is all about membership in 

the -- in the Commission. The Commission's powers, 

by contrast, are set out in article 4 of the -- of 

the compact. There are enumerated powers there and, 

for example, article 4(E)(11), on page 11a -- the 

only enumerated power with respect to sanctions 

there, at the bottom of 11a, is to revoke the 

membership of a party State in accordance with 

article 7(F). 

One would think, if there -- if there was 

an extraordinary power to grant monetary sanctions, 

that it would have appeared in the enumerated powers, 

and in fact, in the one compact adopted at the same 

time that provides for imposition of fines, it

actually appears in the enumerated powers portion of 

the relevant compact, not in the membership. 

And, Justice Breyer, you asked about 

section -- article 7(C), with respect to the power of 

the Commission to be the judge of -- of certain 

matters. I think it's pretty clear that what that's 

driving at is the Commission being the judge of the 

qualifications of the -- of the States and the 

members of the Commission appointed by the States to 

participate. 

It's like the power of any legislative 

body, the power of Congress to determine the 

qualifications of someone who’s about -- who has been 

voted in, should that person be seated. I think 

article 7(C) is directed at that, not at some power 

of --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it adds -- it adds ­

- it starts "Qualifications." It says it's the judge 

of qualification and it's the judge of their 

compliance with the conditions and requirements of 

this compact. 

MR. KNEEDLER: But if you continue -- “And 

the laws” --

JUSTICE BREYER: "And the laws of the 

States relating to the enactment of the compact."

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER 

ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT 

MR. DELLINGER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

I think I should begin with a simple 

question that my grandson asked me, which is why did 

North Carolina quit? Which I think sheds light on 

what its obligations were and what the understanding 

was. 

This is a compact. It is not based upon a 

coercive model. You could have one, where States --

all the States are required to remain in the compact, 

withdrawal is a nullity, the Commission can enforce 

financial sanctions, and the compact members waive 

sovereign immunity and can be sued in Federal court. 

This compact is based on a consensual 

model, where it -- each -- each State can withdraw, 

and therefore the compact has to be in the rough 

financial interest of each of the States at any point 

in time, which is what --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You took -- you 

took $80 million, and they got nothing for it. That 

would be a question your grandson might ask. 

(Laughter.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What did you do 

with the $80 million? 

MR. DELLINGER: The $80 million came from ­

- not the State -- the statement that the States gave 

North Carolina $80 million and North Carolina has 

kept it and didn't give it back is a shorthand that 

is misleading in every single respect. 

The funds, of course, didn't come from the 

States. They contributed $25,000 apiece. It came 

from charges on generators from all over the country. 

The funds went to the authority established under 

North Carolina law and could only be used for the

Waste Authority. 

The master assumes that -- that all --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How did that help the 

other compacting States, giving them the $80 million 

and North Carolina walking away? 

MR. DELLINGER: Well, Justice Sotomayor, no 

one was helped by this process or the process of the 

other compacts, none of which resulted in a -- in a 

facility. But what North Carolina did was to carry 

out its responsibilities to take appropriate steps 

and, as I will show in a moment, fully in accord with 

the understanding of the Commission and North 

Carolina, that they would be -- it would be jointly 

financed, even though the Commission had no legal 

obligation. But the key reason --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm hard-pressed to 

understand where that comes from. Under the terms of 

the contract -- the compact, the compact expressly 

says that none of the contracting States have any 

liabilities with respect to this --

MR. DELLINGER: That is correct, and it 

says that the Commission does not have any legal 

obligation --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Exactly. 

MR. DELLINGER: -- under the compact to 

fund it, either. But it was because this is a 

consensual compact and because of the right to 

withdrawal, as the master noted, it would have been 

surprising if a facility were constructed without 

significant assistance from the States that were not 

the host State because of the right to withdraw, and 

that indeed was recognized from the very beginning. 

For example, in 1996, when the -- the 

chairman of the Commission was hoping to speed up the 

completion, the chairman noted that the opening of a 

new regional facility in North Carolina would ensure 

a source of revenues for site development in the 

third host State. 

Indeed, it's not surprising that, from the 

beginning of the compact, the Commission provided a 

substantial amount of the funding because North 

Carolina could have withdrawn at any point. And the 

Commission repeatedly recognized that it was, quote, 

"necessary and appropriate and reasonable and 

equitable" for the Commission to contribute to this. 

Mr. Phillips cites the North Carolina 

legislation -- the North Carolina legislation, which 

notes that, among the Commission's -- the authority's

corporate powers, when it sets up the authority or 

the financing -- but the North Carolina legislation, 

as the Commission expressly recognized and cited in 

providing the money, provides that North Carolina may 

accept funds from its general assembly. The North 

Carolina authority may accept funds from the North 

Carolina general assembly, from the Commission 

compact, from other States, from the Federal 

Government, or from generators. And they begin to 

say it's necessary and appropriate. 

At every step, they -- the Commission says 

that in -- in February of '88, October of '89, 

September of '92, November of '92, "reasonable and 

equitable to provide this funding," and of course it 

makes sense, given the consensual nature of the 

compact. 

So, what happened? Why did North Carolina 

quit? What happened was, because of the right to 

withdraw, South Carolina withdrew in 1995. When 

South Carolina withdrew, this of course deprived the 

Commission of a ready source of funding from the fees 

that were being paid to the facility in Barnwell, 

South Carolina. 

But much -- or of equal significance is the 

fact that South Carolina, having withdrawn, no longer

had to comply with the compact requirement, that 

South Carolina ceased operating a facility on 

December 31, 1992. 

Why was that important? Because the 

compact creates, as Mr. Phillips noted, something 

like a monopoly within the region, and when you are 

financing the facility you know, if you are the 

financing authority, that you will have a captive 

market --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I see. So --

MR. DELLINGER: Unless -- unless States can 

withdraw. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So I was thinking of this, 

is: What we have are a group of States, each of whom 

feels it's necessary to build a cholera plant. And 

they know that the cholera plant will be hated by 

everybody in their State, but it's necessary. So 

they each say: We’ll undertake it, okay? But the 

deal is you do, too. Now, that's their basic deal. 

I don't know that they ever would have 

entered into this as part of the basic deal that 

State A depends for 4 years on State B doing it, but 

when it's State A's turn, they run away. Well, 

that's the deal. They can run away. But in 

addition, take $80 million? Okay. That's where we

are back with the Chief's question. 

Now, I don't know whether it is an 

appropriate step or not an appropriate step to keep 

the 80 million as well as running away. But it seems 

to me that we have an arbitrator that was supposed to 

decide whether it was or whether it wasn't, and they 

said it was an appropriate step. They foresaw you 

would take the 80 million, never give it back, at 

least. 

But the Commission thinks it isn't. And 

the arbitrator paid no attention whatsoever to the 

Commission. And what the Commission says in the 

language that I quoted is that the Commission is the 

judge of the members' compliance with the 

requirements of this contract. So when I read that, 

I think: Surely, he should have paid some attention 

to the fact that the Commission thought that what was 

keeping the 80 million was not an appropriate step. 

Now, there we are. That's my question. 

And the only answer I've heard so far is, if I read 

the rest of the sentence, it talks about laws of 

States relating to the enactment of this contract --

compact. And I don't know that you read "enactment" 

so narrowly to refer to laws that talked about how 

you adopt it. There might be a whole lot of laws. I

guess you pay attention to all of them. So I don't 

see what the last phrase has to do with it. But 

anyway, that's my basic question in the case. 

MR. DELLINGER: All right. I’ll -- I’ll 

answer them in reverse order: The keeping the 80 

million and the Commission's judgment about that. 

Their argument is either that, you know, the 

Commission is somehow the sole judge of these issues 

or that there's some -- that you should treat a State 

as something like a regulated industry under an 

agency model. And they -- and they point to 7(C), or 

at least the part of 7(C) that they leave in their 

quote, as establishing that. And what I think Mr. 

Kneedler was attempting to say when his time ran out 

is that, if you just read 7(C), it's about 

membership. 

7(C) is in a five-provision sequence: (A), 

(B), (C), (D), and (E). (A) lists the initial State 

members; (B) says how other States can become 

members; (D) provides that the first three States 

which enact and pay their fees will bring the compact 

into existence. And (E) states that members of other 

compacts are not eligible for membership. 

Then (C), in the middle, says that each 

State shall be declared a party State upon payment of

the fees and enactment, and the Commission is the 

judge of the qualifications of the party States and 

of its members and their compliance with the 

conditions and requirements of the compact -- and if 

I may go "dot, dot, dot" -- relating to the enactment 

of this compact. 

Now, that phrase “relating to the 

enactment” might refer just to the preceding phrase 

about laws of the party States. But Mr. Kneedler and 

I both read it more naturally in the context of the 

Commission as judge, that this is about how you judge 

who's a member. It is, in that sense, like the House 

of Representatives provision they quote, except it 

doesn't say "sole judge." 

JUSTICE BREYER: So, in your opinion, the 

Commission is not the judge of anything other than 

membership? 

MR. DELLINGER: Not with --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, therefore, the six 

pages or so of this compact that has to do with a lot 

of detailed issues that might appear before the 

Commission -- it is not the judge of whether there is 

compliance with those issues --

MR. DELLINGER: With respect to parties to 

the compact, the Commission, of course, has to 

interpret the compact when it engages in its sanction 

authority. If it's going to sanction a State that is 

blocking the transmit of other States, it has to 

interpret what it is applying. 

I think what the -- counsel is arguing that 

it was entitled to some special deference, and what 

the master is saying is: Given the right to 

withdraw, why should North Carolina -- why should it 

be allowed any deference over a determination by the 

State that's not a party to the compact? It was not 

required to -- not a party to -- at that point, to 

the compact. 

Now, I do want to answer your question 

about North Carolina keeping the money, because this 

is important. Where --

MR. DELLINGER: Yes.

words -- "the laws of the party States" relating to

JUSTICE SCALIA: Conditions and 

requirements relating to the enactment of the

not very beautifully done, but it's about the 

Commission judging who becomes a member. In (A), 

(B), (C), (D), and (E), and as Mr. Kneedler noted, in 

the other compacts that were based on a model, this ­

- the seventh article is all about eligibility for 

membership. The powers and sanctions and parts are 

elsewhere in the compact.

Termination”? The caption to article 7? 

MR. DELLINGER: Yes. And it's -- it's also 

captions about that subject. 

But if I may return to the question of 

who's got the money: The $80 million coming from 

fees generated by users around the country went 

through the Commission to the authority. It was set 

up in a special separate account just for the 

purposes of the authority. All of the funds were 

expended over this process of a massive amount of 

studies that were done. Not a penny of it could ever 

be spent by the North Carolina General Assembly for 

any purposes whatsoever. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dellinger, what of ­

- what of Mr. Phillips's argument that that $80 

million gave North Carolina a leg up, should there 

ever be any revival of the development of a disposal 

facility; North Carolina is much better situated than 

anyone else to do this, because they have already 

sunk $80,000 into pursuing a license? 

MR. DELLINGER: Well, it has been 10 or 12 

years since this occurred, Justice Ginsburg, and 

there has been no effort and no plan in North 

Carolina to build a facility, and to begin the 

licensing process anew. Some of the information they

-- the authority retained, which would be of use to 

the Commission anywhere, whether there is any site­

specific information that would still be good 15 or 

20 years out, I think is just pure speculation. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Take a hypothetical case 

where North Carolina did have a real advantage and 

they used the money to create a facility, would that 

bear on the unjust enrichment claim or even the 

sanctions claim? 

MR. DELLINGER: Yes. It might well bear on 

the unjust enrichment, if there was, you know, an 

enrichment. What happened here is that the North 

Carolina General Assembly appropriated money that 

went to the authority. Properly considered, North 

Carolina -- the Commission provided money to the 

authority. The North Carolina General Assembly 

provided money for the authority. All the funds were 

spent. The only State that contributed money to this 

process was North Carolina, and North Carolina 

contributed $34 million. 

Now, why did they -- I think one of the 

most useful documents we have is in the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just want -- you said 

the only State that contributed money to the 

Commission was North Carolina? I just want to make

sure I heard that right. 

MR. DELLINGER: Every State contributed 

$25,000 --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That’s it? 

MR. DELLINGER: -- to sign up. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. 

MR. DELLINGER: But aside from that, North 

Carolina General Assembly appropriated $34 million to 

the North Carolina authority, the -- the waste 

disposal authority. They were the only State to do 

so. 

So 80 million had come from the fees 

generated at Barnwell, 34 million from North 

Carolina, and the -- what happened was -- once South 

Carolina withdrew from the compact, was liberated 

from this obligation to close, was announcing that it 

was now going to continue and is open to the world, 

they had a cost advantage and a location advantage 

over North Carolina. 

So in -- in 1996, the joint supplemental 

fact brief at -- appendix at page 143, is where the 

head of the North Carolina authority writes to the 

head of the Commission and notes that, with the 

withdrawal of South Carolina and their decision to 

continue the operation at Barnwell, the financing

options have been substantially changed. 

Under the current compact, any State can 

withdraw up until the North Carolina facility becomes 

operational. With an available alternative disposal 

facility now in South Carolina, there is no assurance 

to potential bondholders or financiers that there 

will be a revenue stream from which to repay any 

indebtedness. Therefore, the authority is in a 

position where the intended vehicles for financing 

are no longer possible. 

One possibility is to modify the compact to 

preclude withdrawal from the compact, once the 

license is issued for the North Carolina facility, 

and that would -- such an amendment would allow --

future use of the facility would be assured, and 

revenue financing could be considered. 

It was not practical to submit that to all 

seven of the other -- all seven legislatures and to 

Congress, but the other problem is it would not have 

-- its -- its passage would, by no means, have been 

assured. The States, at that moment, could either 

stay in or go. 

So North Carolina is faced, after South 

Carolina's withdrawal, with the prospect of advancing 

-- trying to advance bonds for another, at minimum,

$75 million for construction costs, which would bring 

the whole project up to 223 million, close to a 

quarter of a billion dollars, and with now a South 

Carolina facility that is closer to every State in 

the compact, except Virginia, and where, because it 

was built in 1981, it has a competitive cost 

advantage. 

So why is Georgia going to stay in the 

compact, when it has what may be a -- a less costly 

and less distant alternative in going to Barnwell, 

South Carolina? 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why -- why would 

anyone stay in the contract? I take it that your 

point, which is an awfully good one, is that this 

compact was designed, like others, to solve a 

political problem. 

It's necessary for the country to store 

low-level radioactive waste, necessary for health and 

safety, but because of the politics and people's 

understanding, incomplete, no one wants it, and so, 

now, the States have formed a series of compacts. 

And we are told, in an amicus brief, that, 

if this compact is interpreted to allow one State to 

take advantage of another State's having done so for 

years and then run away and keep $80 million to boot,

it will be impossible for many other States to resist 

that same route. 

And that will be the end of compacts 

through the United States, and what we will have is 

low-level waste without storage. That's argument, 

roughly, that's made in an amicus brief in this case, 

and I would like to know your opinion. 

MR. DELLINGER: My response to that is that 

the amicus’ suggestion that a decision for North 

Carolina would impair the very useful mechanism of 

interstate compacts has it exactly backwards. 

States establishing compacts remain 

entirely free to include or add provisions limiting 

the right to withdraw; permitting the imposition of 

sanctions, including financial sanctions; imposing 

those on States that are no longer members; defining 

whether the limits will be a million dollars or a 

hundred million for what they will impose -- or no 

limits at all; and, as the Central Compact did, 

requiring a waiver of sovereign immunity so that 

these judgments can be enforced in Federal court. 

All that's possible. 

But a decision in -- whether or not you 

decide for North Carolina, if that's what you want in 

a compact, you can have that compact, and nothing in

a decision for North Carolina would change that. 

A decision in favor of North Carolina 

would, in fact, benefit the compacting process 

because it would provide assurances to State 

legislators that you can pick up a copy of the 

proposed compact and read it and know that that is 

the extent of the liabilities to which you are 

imposing your -- exposing your State, and that is the 

limit of the obligations you are taking on to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In this case -- in this 

case, how did it come about that the right to 

withdraw any time until the second plant was 

operable, was that -- that was North Carolina's 

proposal after it was designated to be the site? 

MR. DELLINGER: Justice Ginsburg, the 

original compact had no limits whatsoever on 

withdrawal, and when North Carolina was chosen as the 

site, it proposed, as a necessary condition to its 

not -- not withdrawing, that the compact be admitted 

to add a provision, 7(H), which would say that after 

-- 30 days after the second facility becomes 

operational, no State may withdraw without the 

consent of all the other States. 

So North -- North Carolina added a 

limitation on the -- at their behest, a limitation on

the right to withdraw. When South Carolina pulled 

out, it was clear that that limitation on the right 

to withdrawal wasn't good enough because it meant 

that States could withdraw at any time up until the 

new facility became operational, in which case it was 

going to be too late. 

If they pulled out then and went to -- to 

Barnwell, that made it unbondable because there’s no 

guarantee -- what made it possible to contemplate 

financing this by bonds and by other financing 

mechanisms was the insurance of a market and the 

right to withdraw --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why didn't you 

withdraw? I mean, all this is very good. You had 

that absolute right to withdraw, but you didn't 

withdraw in -- when was it -- '97. You went on for 2 

years, still as a member of the compact and still 

subject to obligations under the compact. How could 

it be said that you were taking all appropriate 

steps? What is the language -- all --

MR. DELLINGER: Yes. Appropriate steps --

is held and obtained.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why didn't you withdraw? 

MR. DELLINGER: Because North Carolina 

hoped that -- and no longer spending 2 million a 

year, it spent half a million to get -- to keep the 

authority going, North Carolina kept open the 

possibility that there would be some possible 

financing that might allow this project to be 

completed. 

They did not, as Mr. Phillips suggested, I 

think in error -- they did not have access by staying 

in the compact to the facility at Barnwell, South 

Carolina. South Carolina was -- would close that to 

North Carolina, so -- so --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They had no benefit from 

the compact for those 2 years? 

MR. DELLINGER: But the steps North 

Carolina took for those last 19 months were exactly 

the steps that were appropriate. Because they did 

not have an obligation to fund this at whatever cost 

and because they were willing -- North Carolina's 

willingness to continue the same ratio of funding 

that had been a part of the process for the preceding 

8 years was not going to provide the sums necessary

to complete it, it would have been a waste and a 

squandering of the money of North Carolina's 

taxpayers and the Commission to take any steps that 

required the expenditure --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you are not arguing 

impossibility, though. I mean, the other side --

MR. DELLINGER: No, Justice Scalia. I'm 

not arguing that it's impossible. What -- what I'm 

arguing is that, if North Carolina had continued the 

level of funding, about $3 million a year, on -- on 

average, North Carolina had been contributing; the 

Commission, an average of $7 million had been -- if 

North Carolina had contributed that and some -- it 

would not have come close -- after the withdrawal of 

South Carolina, it would not have come close to 

providing the funds needed to complete the facility. 

Therefore, any funds expended would have 

been wasteful and inappropriate. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Dellinger, your 

brief makes -- I think the reply brief made some 

reference to North Carolina's attempting to get 

funding from another source after Barnwell -- the 

revenues from Barnwell were no longer available to 

it.

make some reference to an effort on North Carolina's 

part to get -- what -- what was that effort? 

MR. DELLINGER: Well, the document I cited, 

December 13, '96, begins to set out some of the 

proposals. One proposal, for example, was to ask 

generators -- major generators to take an equity 

position in the authority, that the North Carolina 

General Assembly would continue its funding at the 

same rate it had. Till the last day, North Carolina 

was willing to spend at that rate. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But what -- what -- you 

just said -- I may not have misunderstood, but I 

thought you said, in response to Justice Scalia, 

that, during 1997 and '98, when he said why didn't 

you take appropriate steps, that you said you didn't 

do anything, and that was the appropriate step; is 

that right? If you -- if you said that --

MR. DELLINGER: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: If I heard you correctly. 

All right. But then it shows in the -- in the 

Special Master's report that, during that time, you 

received from the Commission funds over $7 million. 

So you may not have done anything, but you did take 

$7 million at that time from other people. And so

they are saying, fine, if you didn't take any 

anything, didn't do anything, and that was the 

appropriate step, why isn't it the appropriate step 

now to give us the 7 million back? 

MR. DELLINGER: Justice Breyer, there is a 

-- I -- there is a disconnect between when funds are 

expended and when they are paid into. There is some 

deficit financing, so that the Commission's payment 

in 1998 would have been to provide for expenditures 

that occurred earlier. So there was no -- there was 

-- and there’s no suggestion that there is any money 

left over. And -- and, how can I put it? North 

Carolina doesn't -- never had that money. It went to 

the authority in a separate and dedicated fund that 

could only be used for the authority’s purposes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did North Carolina 

continue to fund the authority during this interim 

period? 

MR. DELLINGER: Yes, North Carolina spent 

half a million dollars a year to fund the authority 

for the remaining 19 months. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So it didn't do nothing 

during this period? 

MR. DELLINGER: That's correct. And let me

which was $4 million, went to pay for current 

expenditures during North -- during that year, 

'97/'98, but the Commission's money, which amounted 

to $7 million in that time, was not spent on current 

things? It was rather a payment for things done in 

the past? 

This sounds not -- I'm not -- I mean, 

that's possible, but I just don't recall anything 

that suggests that.

Commission and from the North Carolina General 

Assembly. Here's the actual --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- wait, wait, wait. 

You said all the Commission funds were for prior 

expenditures. 

MR. DELLINGER: Well, not necessarily. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh. 

MR. DELLINGER: That is to say -- there was 

not $6 million expended during that period. There’s 

not an exact match-up between that list of when 

payments were made and when expenditures were made. 

But the record showed that North Carolina spent about 

-- I believe about -- the authority spent about half 

a million dollars those last 19 months. 

Now, here's the -- here's the actual 

admission that North Carolina, quote, "did nothing." 

Paragraph -- this is at the Plaintiffs’ appendix 460. 

The admission request was: Admit that North Carolina 

took no further steps after December 19th to ensure 

that an application for a license was filed.

Response: It is admitted that the 

authority was deprived of funding upon notification 

from the Commission in or around 1997 that the 

Commission was terminating its transmittal to the 

authority of portions of funds derived from fees and 

surcharges imposed on generators. It is further 

admitted that the authority had justifiably relied --

the North Carolina authority -- on the continued 

provision of these funds in light of the Commission's 

previous words and actions. For this reason, the 

authority did not thereafter take -- thereafter take 

additional steps to site --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the offer --

what about the offer that Mr. Phillips brought up, 

said Commission was ready to pay another $21 million, 

and there was going to be loans from the generators? 

MR. DELLINGER: That proposal, first of 

all, left a significant shortfall, as the master 

found. Even with that proposal, which North Carolina 

thought there were some legal problems with whether 

it would be -- that loans from private generators 

would allow bonding of the remaining financing -- the 

master says it was still a substantial gap left, even 

if North Carolina continued to pay the same amount of 

money.

So, with North Carolina willing to continue 

to pay at the same rate it had for the previous 8 

years, and the Commission unwilling or unable to do 

so, it meant that that level of expenditure by North 

Carolina would be a worthless expenditure of its 

taxpayers' money and the Commission's money. 

The Commission's position seems to be that 

they should have taken steps just for the sake of 

taking steps, like building half a bridge to nowhere, 

when you know that there’s no financing in sight. 

They could have withdrawn on December 19th, and they 

took exactly the steps that were appropriate, which 

is not to spend money that is futile and wasteful. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask you a 

question? Is all of this money that has been spent 

or was spent up until 1999 -- has it been washed 

away? Meaning -- and this may be what remains for 

the unjust enrichment claims, but is there any value 

left to what occurred?

Justice Sotomayor. I would not assume there is any ­

Could I turn, if I could, to the 

participation of the Commission, which we think 

raises a -- a substantial constitutional question? 

This is actually, and should be, a very 

simple question. States, either at common law or 

constitutionally -- for these purposes, it doesn't 

matter which side of the fence you are on in Alden. 

States have a right not to be subject to suit by 

parties that aren't the United States or a sister 

State, absent a valid abrogation. 

The Commission is neither. It’s not a 

State, and that should be pure and simply the answer 

to the question. The issues are whether somehow 

there should be an exception for a compact. It 

should be treated like a State and allowed to sue; 

or, even if it's treated like any other private 

litigant, there is some kind of same-claims exception 

-- in fact, there is one case, Arizona, only, which 

really addresses this point -- there should be a 

same-claims exception. 

First of all, with respect to whether the 

compact ought to be able to sue as if it were a 

State, I think that’s resolved -- and this Court,

by the Hess case. It says that compacts cannot claim 

sovereign immunity. If they don't have the dignity 

or status to claim sovereign immunity, they surely 

ought not be able to affirmatively pierce the 

sovereign immunity of something that is undoubtedly a 

State. They are not --

they are at all comparable. This is a case of does

bring the claim. 

MR. DELLINGER: You could distinguish them 

-- but -- distinguish the two situations. But that 

would cut in favor of this situation. You might 

think that a compact has the right to sue as if it 

were a State, another State, a State, and still think 

that -- you might think it had sovereign immunity, 

but not that it could bring a suit against a State. 

But you certainly wouldn't think that if it's not

But no matter. There’s no good argument. 

With or without Hess, there is no good argument for 

treating a compact as if it were a State. That is a 

slippery road --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why -- why not? I mean, 

if it’s totally a creature of States -- that’s all 

it’s -- there’s no other shareholders, nobody in the

think long and hard before submitting an onerous 

document discovery request on a sister State and 

making that kind of scorched-earth litigation a 

practice. Something that’s not a State doesn't have 

those constraints. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose we 

think that the same State -- or the same-claim rule 

applies, and that if the Commission is asserting the 

same claim as the State, that then it can sue. 

Suppose that's the rule. Are these the same claims? 

MR. DELLINGER: They are -- first of all, 

they are not the same claims. The States who gave 

$25,000 are trying to claim that the Commission 

either is their agent or that they can bring a suit 

that restitution ought to be made to the Commission, 

that is a -- the short answer is those are different 

routes. They are not the same claims, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How can -- how could 

they not be, Mr. Dellinger? There’s only one 

complaint, and that complaint is on behalf of all the 

Plaintiffs, not --

MR. DELLINGER: Yes. But you would have 

the same last line of a complaint if 1 million people 

joined the State who brought an antitrust suit 

against another State. It is simply that -- award

the Plaintiffs such damages as this Court deems just 

and proper. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there’s no discrete 

claim made by the Commission as distinguished from 

South Carolina. 

MR. DELLINGER: Yes, the Commission is 

making a straight-up restitution claim, which, as the 

-- the entity that provided the funds, it does not. 

But let me say why I think the separate and 

-- even if the claims were identical, we don't know, 

at this point, that they will wind up being 

identical, and States shouldn't have to litigate 

until we find out. 

The master just says it's not necessarily 

the case that they will wind up being identical. Mr. 

Phillips says -- counsel for the Plaintiffs said they 

would not concede that they would not, at the end of 

the day, forgo any claim on behalf of the -- of the 

States that the Commission didn't have. 

But, most importantly, there is Alden. 

Alden makes this a civil case because Alden says that 

private suits against non-consenting States present 

the indignity of subjecting a State to the coercive 

processes of judicial tribunals. 

If you allow another party in that's not a

State, you are subjecting a State to all of the 

discovery, all of the different theories, all of the 

depositions, all of the document requests. A sister 

State may, in its attorney general's office, think 

twice about doing that. A private litigant will not. 

So I think this case is that -- I believe 

if you didn't want to overrule Arizona, you could say 

it's a case where the United States brought a case in 

its role as trustee for the Indian tribes and the 

tribes themselves were allowed to intervene, and they 

were, therefore, virtually one and the same party. 

And you wouldn't need to overrule it. I don't think, 

if it stands for any broader principle, it can 

survive Alden v. Maine. 

Now, if the Commission is out, then we 

think there is -- and if you agree that there was no 

breach of contract, then I think the Court should 

direct the dismissal of the quasi-contract claims 

because only the States will be left as a party. 

And those claims -- quasi-contract claims 

of restitution, it’s -- they are claims that are 

governed by the subject matter of the compact between 

the States, and as to parties to the compact, there 

can’t be any such claims, and I think that should be 

the end of it.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS 

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS 

MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice. 

I would like to respond to a number of the 

points that have been made. It seems to me the most 

fundamental one that Mr. Dellinger relies upon is the 

notion that this $80 million was not the money of the 

compact States, and he -- he keeps saying that 

repeatedly -- you know, based solely on the fact that 

the money doesn't come through the treasury of the 

States. 

But he ignores, on 12A, article 4(H)(2)(b), 

which says, with respect to the levying of the 

special fees or surcharges, which was the basis upon 

which the entirety of the $80 million comes, that 

this must represent the financial commitments of all 

party States to the Commission. 

It was the understanding that, in 

exercising the authority to levy these amounts of 

money in order to generate this, that that was the

States' money, all of the States' money, and 

ultimately, if this Court would have determined that 

the money --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That provision just 

says the States don't have to give anything more than 

that, that that's what satisfies whatever obligations 

they may or may have. But where does it say that 

money belongs to them? 

MR. PHILLIPS: It says each State hosting ­

- you know, "shall annually levy surcharges." The 

total of those surcharges represent the financial 

commitments of all of the party States to the 

Commission. That seems to me to say that it is the 

commitment of the party States that's -- that's being 

provided for in that context. 

It's not the money of the Commission. It's 

not the money of the generators. It's the money of 

the compact States that's being used for whatever 

purpose is necessary in order to fulfill the overall 

objectives of the compact. In this context, it was 

used to ask North Carolina to go forward to site a 

facility. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. I don't -- I don't 

understand that. 

MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry.

JUSTICE SCALIA: It never passes through 

the States, and this provision just waves a magic 

wand and says that it represents the financial 

commitments of all party States to the Commission. 

What proportion from each State? Do we know? 

MR. PHILLIPS: We don't know, and we 

wouldn't -- and the truth is, at the end --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think all this means is 

that that is the only financial commitment that the 

States are obliged to -- to make. 

MR. PHILLIPS: I think there’s no question 

that it -- that it can be read as -- as saying that, 

which, of course, then tells you, if it's not the 

Commission's responsibility and it's not the States’ 

responsibility, then it was clearly, from the outset 

and has always been, North Carolina's. 

But I think it goes beyond that, Justice 

Scalia. I think it actually tells you, as an 

agreement among all of the party States to this 

compact, that this is the money of the States, and 

ultimately --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It can't be the money of 

the States if you can't say how much of it belongs to 

each State.

JUSTICE SCALIA: That just doesn't make any 

sense. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there would be a way 

to allocate it. It seems to me that maybe -- that 

either the Commission, based on the vote of the 

parties -- the party States, could either allocate it 

back on a pro rata basis, or they can do it on the 

basis of the percentage of the -- of the waste that 

was used in any particular fund. 

There’s no specific provision on that, but 

it seems to me that doesn't detract, Justice Scalia, 

from the fundamental point that what the compact 

members agreed upon was that this money would be the 

money of all of the States. And, therefore, we can't 

keep it as a Commission. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the money that’s --

but the money that is talked about in that section, 

as I read it, that’s money that would be generated 

after the facility was completed. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right, South Carolina, in 

this particular context. The -- immediately, it 

would be South Carolina, and ultimately, then --

assuming North Carolina or another State were to site 

a facility, then, from there on, that money would 

continue to be their commitment.

JUSTICE STEVENS: So you’re saying the 

money generated by the South Carolina facility was 

the money of the compact members? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And that was the money 

that was given to North Carolina? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Right, because the compact 

agreed among themselves, as part of this agreement, 

that the -- that they would have authority to impose 

those surcharges on the generators, as they brought 

the money in. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But then -- but 

those States couldn't take the money. They couldn't 

say, I want my share? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think they could 

have, actually. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are saying it 

was their money, but they had no access to it. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, but I -- through 

their membership, they certainly did. If the States 

agreed to disband the compact and the -- the 

Commission disappears and there’s $80 million in the 

pot, that money's going somewhere. It's not staying 

in -- it may get paid for legal fees, but other than 

that --

JUSTICE BREYER: And they go to a booth, 

and now they are charged something. And is the fee 

and special surcharge, which this refers to, the 

total charge? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.

how they did it. But, anyway, there’s a charge. Say 

it's $1,000, or maybe it's $10,000. 

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, that would be a bit 

high.

has to pay $10,000 to the authority.

mean, the alternative way to do it, obviously --

used it in this context. But that's the basic point, 

Justice Breyer. If they didn't have this provision, 

you would -- you might assume it was the generators’ 

money or somebody else's money. 

The whole point of this provision was to 

say these moneys, which can only be levied because of 

the compact and the Commission's authority, remain

the responsibility of the States and, ultimately, to 

my mind at least, would clearly go back to them. 

Justice Breyer, I wanted to answer your 

question with respect to findings of breach. January 

'98, there is -- the joint supplemental appendix, 

page 55, makes the -- is the Commission sanction 

order, and April '99 -- and, again, at appendix 323 

and appendix 412 -- those are specific findings by 

the Commission that there have been breaches. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I just understand 

-- and I don't know if I am missing something -- your 

theory that this belongs to the States relies 

exclusively on either an agency or an ownership 

theory as alternatives? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There's nothing else 

that would make it --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I’m relying on this 

provision of the compact that says it is the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's -- that's -- if 

we disagree with that --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, yes --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: For the return of the 

$80 million. 

MR. PHILLIPS: I -- I think that the Court 

-- yes, I think the Court would still have the 

authority, even in dealing with what is the 

appropriate rule of restitution, because we are too 

far away from that at this stage. We're not -- we're 

not there. 

But I think, if the Court finds that North 

Carolina breached the compact, it ought to try to 

find a reasonable way to remedy that particular 

problem, even if the technical standards didn't 

apply. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If we don't do that, 

what are you left with? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, no, Justice Sotomayor, 

you do do that. I mean, when the Court in Kansas v. 

Colorado was trying --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I already posed a 

hypothetical. Don't -- if we don't, what is left of 

this case?

still has the authority, in deciding what is the 

appropriate standard of restitution in a problem as 

unique as this one, to do what it did in Kansas v. 

Colorado, which is to say: How do we measure the 

damages to this party? Let's look at what the injury 

was to the farmers who were completely unrelated to 

it. They clearly wouldn't -- they weren't parties to 

that litigation, and the Court said that's a 

perfectly legitimate way to figure out the right 

damages. So I think we would still have an argument 

that you -- that the Court would have the authority 

to grant that form of restitution under these 

circumstances. 

Mr. Dellinger spent a lot of time on what 

strikes me as sort of a complete fantasy with respect 

to the funding situation that North Carolina faced. 

You know, once South Carolina left, to be sure, we 

lost the ability to take money and help North 

Carolina. But the notion that North Carolina, if it 

had completed this facility, was not going to have a 

license to print money in the -- in going forward and 

that funding wouldn't have been available back in 

those days is not in the record. And, frankly, it's 

completely counterintuitive, because they have a 

monopoly. That's what the compact specifically

provides for them, is the monopoly to be able to 

control the fees that -- on these particular wastes. 

Yes, Your Honor? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: The ability to withdraw 

terminates upon completion of the facility? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Six months afterwards. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Six months afterwards. So 

the -- the facility's completed. It's clear they are 

going to have to -- they are going to be charging 

more than South Carolina, which is a lower cost 

facility, having been in existence for longer. Why 

wouldn't everybody get out? 

MR. PHILLIPS: Because the risk that South 

Carolina is going to pull up stakes and stop because 

it's been making that noise from the beginning --

that was the reason for the crisis. Washington and 

South Carolina said: We're not going to take every 

other -- every other State's waste, and we are 

getting out of this business. So the risk you would 

take in jumping out in the six months is that you 

then find out at the back end you have no place to 

dispose of your waste. 

So the reality is, they had -- all of the 

incentives to go forward existed as much in 1997 as 

they did in 1995, as they did in 1999. The only

thing that's fundamental here is they had a 

responsibility not just to do what was appropriate; 

it was to do what was appropriate to get a license, 

and that's what they never did. They walked away. 

They took no action. Trying to negotiate funding in 

the abstract doesn't have anything to do with moving 

forward to get a license. On that score, the 

authority shut down and closed. 

Justice Sotomayor, you asked: Is there any 

benefit that remains? Well, the reality is, geology 

studies and hydrology studies that get done, those 

things don't change for a billion years. So every 

one of those studies that was done is going to be 

just as valid today 12 years later, although I do 

think the right way to analyze this is not in terms 

of 12 years later, but what would have happened at 

the time.
