2  (11:04 a.m.) 

3  JUSTICE STEVENS: We'll now hear argument in 

4 Johnson against the United States. 

5  Mr. Reichman. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF COURTLAND REICHMAN 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. REICHMAN: Justice Stevens, and may it 

9 please the Court: 

10  On occasion a prior conviction that's used to 

11 enhance a Federal sentence turns out to have been obtained 

12 in violation of the Constitution. This Court addressed 

13 the procedure for handling those challenges in Custis and 

14 Daniels. Those cases determined that, in most 

15 circumstances, the facts that would show the prior 

16 conviction is unconstitutional do not support a claim 

17 either at sentencing or under section 2255. 

18  This is the key phrase in this case: facts 

19 supporting the claim. It's the key part of the fourth 

20 trigger in the 2255 statute of limitations. In this case, 

21 the State court vacatur is the fact supporting the claim 

22 for three reasons. 

23  First, as expressed, Daniels made clear that the 

24 underlying facts, those facts that you use for the 

25 challenge to the prior conviction, do not support a claim 

Page 3 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 under 2255, leaving the vacatur as the operative fact.


2  Second, the plain meaning of the word fact


3 encompasses a vacatur just like courts often refer to


4 convictions as historical facts.


5  And third, there's no reason to dispense with


6 the plain language of the statute to serve policy ends.


7 The policies animating both AEDPA and section 2255 are


8 served by the rule advanced by petitioner. And moreover,


9 petitioner's rule will be a lot more straightforward in


10 application.


11  Let me -­


12  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: One little complication here. 


13 Under 2255, even if that applies in this situation, it


14 does establish a 1-year statute of limitations. Right?


15  MR. REICHMAN: Correct.


16  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And subsection (4) of that


17 section says: the date on which the facts supporting the


18 claim or claims presented could have been discovered


19 through the exercise of due diligence. Now, is that a


20 requirement that the defendant seek State relief on a


21 timely basis? Can the defendant just wait indefinitely


22 before going back to the State and seeking a vacatur? Or


23 does that due diligence requirement apply to the efforts


24 to get State action?


25  MR. REICHMAN: Well, there -- there are several


Page 4 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 levels to the response. Let me work through them.


2  The first is that the petitioner's position


3 relies on a straightforward reading of the statute, and we


4 think that the due diligence requirement is satisfied when


5 the vacatur is discovered through the exercise of due


6 diligence. 


7  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but you're not being


8 responsive to my question. Here the defendant did go back


9 to the State courts and got this -- the earlier


10 convictions vacated. Right?


11  MR. REICHMAN: Yes. 


12  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But I asked you, is there any


13 requirement that the defendant act promptly in going back


14 to the State to get the vacaturs?


15  MR. REICHMAN: There's no requirement in -- in


16 the fourth trigger. However -­


17  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, except that the statute


18 itself speaks of diligence. 


19  Now, can the -- suppose he's been given a very


20 long Federal sentence and part of that is the result of


21 prior State convictions. And suppose he waits 10 years


22 before going back to the State to seek to overturn those


23 earlier State convictions. Is there no requirement that


24 he act promptly?


25  MR. REICHMAN: The requirement is not found in


Page 5 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 the fourth trigger. The requirement is found in the State 

2 statutes of limitations. And to elaborate on the 

3 footnotes in our brief, we have found that there are 

4 approximately -­

5  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but the Federal statute 

6 says -- it puts a burden of diligence on the defendant. 

7  MR. REICHMAN: Reading the plain language, we 

8 think that burden of diligence applies to discovering the 

9 vacatur. If you -- if a vacatur is a fact -- and I think 

10 the Government has all but -­

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: How -- how could one not 

12 discover the vacatur? 

13  Here's my problem. I -- I frankly don't think 

14 the text of -- of (4), part (4), really fits comfortably 

15 with either your interpretation or the Government's. It 

16 says the date on which the facts supporting the claim 

17 could have been discovered through the exercise of 

18 diligence. 

19  Well, as you point out in your brief, the fact 

20 supporting the claim here is simply the elimination of the 

21 prior conviction, the vacatur of the prior conviction. 

22 That's the fact supporting the claim, not the facts which 

23 led to the vacatur, but it's the vacatur. So that makes 

24 the Government's case a little uncomfortable. 

25  But it seems to me you have to acknowledge that 

Page 6 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 your case is pretty uncomfortable when you -- when you


2 talk about discovering the fact of the -- of the vacatur. 


3 I mean, it's a matter of public record. How does one


4 discover a -- a public record? How -- how could you need


5 due diligence to discover a public record? I mean, it


6 seems to me it's -- it's automatically -- isn't the


7 vacatur always served on the -- on the person whose


8 conviction is vacated? Isn't it always that person who


9 seeks the vacation? So what sense does it make to talk


10 about his discovering that particular fact? It seems to


11 me it makes no sense. 


12  So you're left with -- with two competing


13 interpretations, both of which have some textual problems. 


14 I'm inclined to think you take the one that makes sense,


15 given the purpose of the statute, and the purpose of the


16 statute, as Justice O'Connor has suggested, is to make


17 people bring up their claims promptly. And -- and that


18 purpose would -- would be served by the Government's rule


19 and not by yours. You say unless the State has some


20 statute of limitation, this -- this Federal requirement of


21 due diligence goes begging.


22  What's -- what's your response to that? You


23 really think -- especially about the discover.


24  MR. REICHMAN: I do and here's why, first,


25 starting with the language before I turn to the policy


Page 7 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 side of your question. 


2  On the language, paragraph (4), the fourth


3 trigger, is broad language that was meant to cover a


4 variety of circumstances, things from ineffective


5 assistance of counsel, to Brady violations, to vacaturs. 


6 I'll grant you that if Congress only intended the vacatur


7 situation to be covered by paragraph (4), we might wonder


8 why they chose those particular words, but we know they


9 didn't intend this one circumstance. 


10  I think the Government's position as to discover


11 boils down to this. Because the answer to the question,


12 when could the vacatur have been discovered through


13 reasonable diligence, is easy, the answer must be wrong.


14 And we don't believe that to be the case. We think that


15 you can easily ask when could the vacatur have been


16 discovered through the exercise of reasonable -­


17  JUSTICE BREYER: And when it could have been


18 discovered I guess if he had taken due diligence and gone


19 and made the motion within a year, at least, of his having


20 been convicted in the Federal court. 


21  I mean, I don't see how you can have it both


22 ways. You want us to read that phrase very broadly to


23 include under the word facts something like a vacatur, and


24 then it sounds to me you're being very literal and


25 linguistic when you say that due diligence to find the


Page 8 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 facts shouldn't mean what I would take it as ordinarily 

2 meaning, that -- that you have to, when you had a chance, 

3 go back and generate this fact. 

4  MR. REICHMAN: I -­

5  JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see how you can do 

6 both, in other words. 

7  MR. REICHMAN: I think we can. I think both the 

8 interpretations of each of those contested words are 

9 strict interpretations right within the plain meaning. 

10 And our case can boil down to asking whether there's 

11 something wrong with my English language when I say, on 

12 what day could the vacatur have been discovered through 

13 the exercise of due diligence. It's -­

14  JUSTICE BREYER: On the pure English language, 

15 it's not exactly a fact. 

16  MR. REICHMAN: Well -­

17  JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, it's a legal 

18 determination. We usually separate law from fact. 

19  MR. REICHMAN: And -- and as we point out in our 

20 brief, there's nothing -- in this context in particular, a 

21 vacatur is like a conviction. It's a fact, you know, that 

22 is -- is commonly referred to by the court. 

23  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, just so that I understand 

24 your argument then, going back to Justice O'Connor's 

25 question, if you get a long sentence, can you sit there 

Page 9 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 for 10 years, then initiate the process to get the earlier 

2 conviction vacated and then say, as soon as it is, with 

3 due diligence I'm here at the courthouse because, although 

4 I waited 10 years, I have brought my 2255 as soon as I 

5 learned that my earlier sentence had been vacated? Your 

6 answer to that question, I take it, is yes, he satisfies 

7 the statute. 

8  MR. REICHMAN: He satisfies the statute, but I 

9 need to point out something that I think is critical to 

10 understanding this question. At the end of the day, we're 

11 talking about at most six States where this might be at 

12 issue. The rest of them either have laches or statutes of 

13 limitations. And these are small States. We're talking 

14 about a rule -­

15  JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay, but in -- in six States, 

16 I would have thought that, A, the due diligence language, 

17 together with the general obvious policy of AEDPA, to get 

18 this over with, would have made it very difficult to 

19 conclude that he can sit there without doing anything for 

20 10 years. 

21  MR. REICHMAN: Well, I -­

22  JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe it's only in six States, 

23 but six States count. 

24  MR. REICHMAN: They do count. But it ties into 

25 the response -- the second part of Justice Scalia's 

Page 10 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 question is, isn't finality served? Isn't that what AEDPA


2 is all about? We don't believe that the Government's rule


3 that they propose will serve finality in the vast majority


4 of cases because in the vast majority of cases, you're


5 talking about claims that will have no merit in State


6 court. But because it's very difficult to complete the


7 State court habeas process before the 1 year in the first


8 paragraph, these petitioners will file placeholder


9 petitions in Federal court and have them held while they


10 finish their State court review. So what you're doing is


11 you're talking about these six States, maybe 10 guys a


12 year, you're going to cause, as the Brackett court on


13 remand said, thousands of placeholder petitions to be


14 filed, and you're needlessly extending all of those cases


15 so that you cut off the rights for maybe 10 people who


16 happen to be in these States.


17  JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. Here's -- here's a


18 simple way of looking at it. The minute that you're


19 convicted and you are subject to the enhanced sentence


20 based on a prior conviction, the obligation of due


21 diligence begins. You can't sit there for 10 years. 


22 That's the point at which you've got to file your petition


23 so that you can come into court with reasonable


24 promptness, if not by the sentencing hearing itself, as


25 soon afterwards as the State process allows you.


Page 11 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  That would be a simple due diligence point. It 

2 wouldn't involve placeholder petitions, and it would get 

3 things concluded with reasonable promptness. Why isn't 

4 that a way of -- of applying the statute? 

5  MR. REICHMAN: Because if you were going to be 

6 strict about it -- and -- and I'm not sure I understand 

7 all of the parameters of the hypothetical -- in -­

8  JUSTICE SOUTER: Easy. The minute he's 

9 convicted, the State has charged him and -- and -- or his 

10 -- by some charging document has made clear that there is 

11 going to be an invocation of a prior conviction for an 

12 enhanced sentence. As soon as he is convicted of the 

13 later offense in which that sentencing possibility has 

14 been raised, he has an obligation to go into the State 

15 court and start the process of -- of getting his earlier 

16 conviction vacated. Easy. 

17  MR. REICHMAN: If Mr. Johnson had done that in 

18 this case, he still would have missed the 1-year statute 

19 of limitations. If Mr. Gadsen had done that in the Fourth 

20 Circuit case by Judge Wilkinson, he still would have 

21 missed the 1-year statute of limitations. 

22  JUSTICE SOUTER: But he would have acted with 

23 due diligence and he would have had as -- I suppose, a 

24 very powerful argument, which -- which the Government 

25 apparently would accept, for -- for tolling. 

Page 12 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  MR. REICHMAN: For equitable tolling? Well, I


2 don't know that the Government would accept equitable


3 tolling. 


4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, as I understood Justice


5 Souter's question, it is the alternate that the Government


6 said. The Government puts forward two arguments, and its


7 alternate argument sounds to me just like what Justice


8 Souter put to you, that is, he has to move diligently to


9 challenge those underlying convictions, that he cannot


10 challenge in Federal court because of -- was it -- Curtis


11 and Daniels. 


12  Why isn't that an -- an accommodation of what we


13 know was the concern of the Federal court -- of the -- of


14 the Congress that people act diligently? It happens that


15 2255 wasn't framed with Curtis and Daniels in mind. There


16 isn't any indication that the drafters of 2255 were aware


17 of this peculiar situation where you can't make the


18 challenge in Federal court, you must go back to the State


19 forum. But we do know they were concerned with diligence.


20  MR. REICHMAN: Well, AEDPA was enacted after


21 Custis was decided and I think we presume that the


22 Congress was aware of the precedent, but the -­


23  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Now, wasn't -- didn't Mr.


24 Johnson here wait a couple of years after the Federal


25 sentencing before he tried to go back to the State courts?


Page 13 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  MR. REICHMAN: Yes, he did.


2  The -- the -- our answer -­


3  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: I'm not sure that was a


4 diligent sort of a -- an effort.


5  MR. REICHMAN: We believe it was diligent within


6 the -- the fourth trigger because, again, we rely on the


7 plain language. And the -- the fall-back position, to


8 address your question and Justice Souter's question, is


9 that we don't believe -- we believe this is engrafting a


10 whole different statutory scheme on top of the one that we


11 have. The fall-back position of the Government is to say,


12 all right, let's interpret the statute or rewrite it to


13 say that we're going to trigger the date on when the


14 vacatur could have been obtained, not when it could have


15 been discovered. And to do that, what they're saying is,


16 well, let's give him a year from the time of the Federal


17 sentencing. So -- or -- or maybe even earlier, dating


18 back to the time of the original conviction in State


19 court. So they add that 1-year statute of limitations. 


20 Then they say then we'll add a provision that tolls during


21 the pendency of State habeas, and then we'll add another


22 1-year statute of limitations on top of that after the


23 vacatur is obtained. So we end up with -- instead of the


24 plain language, we have two 1-year statutes of limitations


25 with a tolling provision in between, the type of tolling


Page 14 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 provision that is, by the way, in section 2244.


2  We believe that petitioner's interpretation,


3 although the answer is not difficult, it -- it is the


4 correct answer. On what date did the -- could the vacatur


5 have been discovered through the exercise of due


6 diligence? And the answer I think was -­


7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you -- you have to


8 concede that you are watering down almost to nothing any


9 due diligence requirement because on your reading of the


10 statute, there isn't -- there isn't any such requirement.


11  MR. REICHMAN: Well, we think that that is -­


12 I'll -- I'll say that there's no -- we don't believe that


13 there is a requirement in the Federal statute, in


14 agreement with -- with your statement, to exercise


15 diligence and seeking the vacatur. But we believe that


16 that is a necessary consequence of the administrative


17 decision that this Court made in Custis and Daniels to


18 send these back to the State court. 


19  It -- it could have been the case that these


20 were all challenged at sentencing, and in fact, I think


21 that was the prevailing practice before Custis, that they


22 were challenged at sentencing. But Custis and then


23 followed on by Daniels made a different decision, and I


24 think a good one. It made the decision to wrap these


25 challenges back to the State and that inevitably will


Page 15 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 result in delays as it works it way through the State.


2  The rationale for the Court's decision makes


3 perfect sense when you apply it to this context. One of


4 the key concerns, it seems to me, that the Court had was


5 that if you allow these Federal challenges that are


6 outside the State statute of limitations, then it's very


7 possible the State is not going to have the records


8 necessary to defend it because they wouldn't be expected


9 to keep records outside of their statute of limitations.


10  And that's simply not the case here because


11 these challenges, under the petitioner's rule, would be


12 within the State statutes of limitations, and as this


13 Court recognized in Daniels, the States have a powerful


14 interest in defending their convictions and that powerful


15 interest, it seems to me, would lead them to preserve the


16 records necessary to maintain their convictions.


17  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you make the argument or is


18 it implicit in your argument -- maybe you don't have this


19 concern -- that if you imply a Federal due diligence


20 standard on your duty to vacate the State conviction, that


21 it's just too burdensome on the petitioner who has to


22 begin fighting the vacatur battle at the same time that he


23 has only 1 year to complete his habeas with reference to


24 the other challenges to his conviction?


25  MR. REICHMAN: That is not something that we've


Page 16 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 argued in the briefs. It -- it, no doubt, is true 

2 especially when you're talking about a pro se petitioner. 

3  JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask? You mentioned -- I 

4 just want to be sure I understand your point -- that there 

5 are only six States that are really affected by this rule. 

6 Is that because all the other States have State 

7 limitations periods that require the prisoner to act 

8 promptly? 

9  MR. REICHMAN: Limitations period by statute or 

10 they have a laches principle that would limit the ability. 

11  JUSTICE STEVENS: So that the -- the 

12 hypothetical of the prisoner waiting 10 years to challenge 

13 the State conviction can only arise in a few States. Is 

14 that right? 

15  MR. REICHMAN: That's right, and from what I can 

16 tell from the Department of Justice statistics, there are 

17 even fewer number of convictions in those States, and best 

18 I can back-of-the-envelope it, we're talking about maybe I 

19 think less than 10 people per year. 

20  JUSTICE KENNEDY: In those -- in those six 

21 States or those few States --

22  MR. REICHMAN: Yes. 

23  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- have those States all made 

24 clear they'd say we will never apply laches, or is it just 

25 the case that there have never -- there's never been an 

Page 17 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 instance where the laches issue was presented to them? 

2  MR. REICHMAN: The latter is more accurate. I'm 

3 -- I'm -- I was trying not to overreach, but I went with 

4 the cases that States that were clear that laches would 

5 apply either by statute or by case law. 

6  And why this becomes particularly important to 

7 me is because we think the petitioner's rule serves the 

8 ends of the Federal court overall, especially when you're 

9 talking about finality because it seems to be the tail 

10 wagging the dog, in a way, to have a rule that cuts off 

11 the possibility of the 10-year scenario for these few 

12 cases and then causes thousands of placeholder petitions 

13 to be filed and managed. And it has been pointed, you 

14 know, average non-merits dismissal, we're talking about 

15 roughly 260 days. It's a burden on the court that's 

16 unnecessary, particularly to bring it back, when we think 

17 that in light of Custis and Daniels, the plain language 

18 takes us all the way there. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I know -- I know -­

20  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But do you have any 

21 explanation of why your client waited so long? 

22  MR. REICHMAN: The record doesn't reveal except 

23 that he is pro se. 

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Pro se. 

25  MR. REICHMAN: Yes. 

Page 18 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even -- that was the question


2 I was going to ask. With respect to -- he came into


3 Federal court and he said -- a little -- like 3 days too


4 late to move to extend the time to file the 2255. That


5 motion was denied. That motion was made in April of '97,


6 and then he doesn't file for State habeas to get rid of


7 those prior convictions until February of '98. Is -- is


8 there any indication of why, when the Federal court says


9 we're not going to extend your time, he waits so long to


10 go to the State court?


11  MR. REICHMAN: There's -- I'm aware of the


12 facts, but there's none in the record other than the fact


13 that he's pro se and has limited education.


14  I want to point out one thing that -- that I


15 think is important perhaps, if -- if the Court were to go


16 a way of equitable tolling, which as I've said, I don't


17 believe is appropriate. But you mentioned that it was 3


18 days too late that he filed. Looking back at the record,


19 I -- I don't think that's accurate. It shows that it was


20 received by the court on April 25th, 1997, which is 1 day


21 after the grace period under AEDPA which -- it expired on


22 April 24th, 1997. Well, he did it by mail, and under the


23 mailbox rule, that would have been a timely motion to the


24 extent that we are concerned with equitable tolling and -­


25 and permitting the placeholder petition of that kind.

1  But again, this -- this difficulty in managing


2 the process is familiar to the court because it -- it's


3 what happens when you have these pro se petitioners.


4  The important thing in this case, we believe,


5 the core concern is with the plain language of the


6 statute. Because Daniels in substance said, the


7 underlying facts to a State court vacatur do not support a


8 claim, we believe that you have to read section 2255,


9 paragraph (4) to say that, okay, then the operative fact


10 is a vacatur. 


11  And this case -- it's a very real concern


12 because without the prior convictions that were later


13 vacated, Mr. Johnson would have a roughly 7-year sentence. 


14 Those prior convictions that were vacated -- and we all


15 can conclude now were unconstitutional -- added 8 more


16 years on his sentence. He's serving more time on the


17 enhancements than he was on the underlying sentence. And


18 of course, the sentencing scheme depends on reliability of


19 the information used for purposes of sentencing, and


20 that's why Congress chose to enact the fourth paragraph


21 and the statute of limitations so that there would be an


22 opportunity to correct unreliable information when it came


23 to light and it was discovered.


24  If there are no further questions, I would


25 reserve the remainder of my time.

1  JUSTICE STEVENS: You may. Thank you. 


2  Mr. Himmelfarb.


3  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB


4  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


5  MR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Stevens, and may it


6 please the Court:


7  Petitioner's State court habeas corpus petition,


8 which challenged his guilty plea on a ground available at


9 the time of the plea, was filed nearly 9 years after the


10 plea was entered and nearly 2 years after a subsequent


11 Federal conviction became final. Petitioner,


12 nevertheless, contends that the challenge to his Federal


13 sentence was timely under AEDPA's 1-year statute of


14 limitations because it was filed within a year of the date


15 on which his State conviction was vacated. That


16 interpretation, which enables a defendant to extend the


17 limitation period for challenging his Federal conviction


18 by delaying a challenge to his State conviction, is


19 fundamentally at odds with the statutory text, the


20 statutory purpose, and the overall statutory scheme.


21  To begin with the statutory scheme, under clause


22 (1) of AEDPA's limitation provision, the presumptive rule


23 is that a defendant wishing to -- to collaterally


24 challenge a Federal conviction has a year from the date on


25 which the conviction becomes final. 


Page 21 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  Clauses (2), (3) -- (2), (3), and (4) create


2 exceptions to that general rule when a prisoner is unable


3 to comply with the rule in clause (1) for reasons beyond


4 his control. The fundamental flaw in petitioner's


5 interpretation is that it would excuse compliance with the


6 presumptive rule in clause (1) for a reason that is not


7 beyond his control, a failure to exercise diligence in


8 challenging his State conviction. 


9  Petitioner's interpretation is also inconsistent


10 with the statutory purpose of the limitation provision.


11  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, are you saying that (4)


12 is inapplicable?


13  MR. HIMMELFARB: No, Justice Kennedy. We agree


14 that (4) is applicable in a case like this. It's just


15 that our position is that petitioner's interpretation of


16 it is wrong. We offer two alternative interpretations of


17 how paragraph 6(4) would apply in a case like this.


18  Before I get to them, I'd like to respond to a


19 question that you asked when petitioner's counsel was


20 standing up here, and that had to do with the difficulty


21 of getting everything that needed to be done done in the


22 space of a year. 


23  It's critical to keep in mind that in the


24 typical case of this type, the factual basis for the State


25 claim is going to available at the time of the State


Page 22 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 guilty or trial, which in almost every case is going to be


2 years before the Federal conviction becomes final. And


3 since the limitation provision under AEDPA runs from the


4 latest of the four dates, in a typical case a defendant is


5 going to have many years to seek the vacatur of a State


6 conviction and he'll have up until a year after his


7 Federal conviction becomes final to challenge it.


8  JUSTICE STEVENS: But do you agree with your


9 opponent that most States have their own limitations


10 period that will reduce the number of cases in which there


11 can be inordinate delay?


12  MR. HIMMELFARB: Some States do have statutes of


13 limitations. Many don't. Massachusetts is a prime


14 example. It doesn't. Many of the cases of this type that


15 come through the Federal courts arise based on a -- a


16 vacated Massachusetts conviction. My understanding is


17 that perhaps as many as half the States don't have


18 limitation provisions in non-capital cases. 


19  JUSTICE STEVENS: But he says some of them have


20 doctrines of laches that would kick in.


21  MR. HIMMELFARB: I think that's -- that -- that


22 may well be true, Justice Stevens, but laches is a much


23 more -- a -- a case-by-case -­


24  JUSTICE STEVENS: It -- it does seem to me that


25 the State has a greater interest than the Federal


Page 23 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 Government does in the finality of its own convictions, 

2 and so the State would be the primary guardian of 

3 preventing dilatory tactics, it would seem to me. 

4  MR. HIMMELFARB: The -- the State does have an 

5 interest. The problem is that when there's a delay in 

6 filing a challenge to a State conviction, one of two 

7 things can be happen -- can happen, and the cases bear 

8 this out. One is that you have a State prosecutor who is 

9 perfectly diligent and wants to defend the conviction but, 

10 because of the lapse of time, can't because the requisite 

11 records aren't available. The other thing you see in some 

12 of these cases is that because the State sentence has been 

13 served by the time it's challenged in cases of this type, 

14 the State prosecutor doesn't have the same kind of 

15 incentive -­

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, as to your first -­

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: I was going to say that. What 

18 -- what -- excuse me. 

19  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- as to your first -- as to 

20 your first instance, if there's lack of diligence, then 

21 there's laches. If the records are destroyed, somebody 

22 sits on their rights and the records are destroyed, then 

23 you have an obvious defense of laches. 

24  MR. HIMMELFARB: The -- the important point, 

25 Justice Kennedy, is the limitation provision at issue here 

Page 24 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 has to do with the finality of Federal convictions. 

2 Congress was concerned that challenges to Federal 

3 convictions not be -­

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, we're -- yes, I -- I 

5 recognize that that's going to be the ultimate issue, but 

6 your point was, oh, well, the State is powerless because 

7 the prosecutor might not have the records. The States 

8 have laches provisions precisely for that circumstance. 

9  MR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Kennedy, we're not 

10 saying that States are powerless, and there are many 

11 cases, probably the majority of them, where States do 

12 diligently defend their own convictions in cases of this 

13 type. Unfortunately, the reported cases show that there 

14 are many cases where either they're not able to or they're 

15 unwilling to because the State sentence has long since 

16 been served. 

17  JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Himmelfarb -­

18  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, in this case now, the 

19 petitioner did obtain a vacatur of the two State 

20 convictions. Isn't that so? Don't we accept that as a 

21 fact in this case? 

22  MR. HIMMELFARB: Yes, Justice O'Connor. He 

23 actually obtained vacatur of seven prior State 

24 convictions, only one of which was relevant to the career 

25 offender sentence that he received in the Federal case. 

Page 25 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But he did succeed. And then 

2 we have to look at whether the petitioner has complied 

3 with section 2255 of AEDPA. And so we look to subpart 

4 (4), do we not, in this case to answer that? 

5  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, in a case of this type, 

6 you would have to look to both subpart (1) and subpart (4) 

7 and determine which one gives him more time, and whichever 

8 one gives him more time is the one that applies. We think 

9 that 6(1) applies because under 6(4) he waited far too 

10 long to challenge his State conviction. 

11  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, that's possible, but 

12 you also question whether the vacatur can be a fact under 

13 subsection (4). 

14  MR. HIMMELFARB: We don't really, Justice 

15 O'Connor. 

16  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay. 

17  MR. HIMMELFARB: I think the lower court placed 

18 some weight on that idea. We don't dispute that if a 

19 conviction is a fact, the vacatur can be as well. 

20  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Okay. You think that the -­

21 the vacatur here could be a fact, but then you say that 

22 even so, the petitioner didn't go back to State court 

23 diligently and on a timely basis. 

24  MR. HIMMELFARB: That's exactly right. The 

25 textual language we rely on is not fact or facts 

Page 26 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 supporting the claim, but rather could have been


2 discovered through the exercise of due diligence. 


3  JUSTICE O'CONNOR: And you say he was not


4 diligent in challenging those convictions.


5  MR. HIMMELFARB: That's -- that's absolutely our


6 position, Justice O'Connor. 


7  JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. -­


8  JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's -- go on. 


9  JUSTICE SOUTER: Would -- would you comment on


10 -- on one difficulty I have with what, I take it, is your


11 preferred position of measuring due diligence from -- as I


12 understand it, from the -- the date at which the State


13 conviction became final? 


14  Most of these -- I think it is fair to say that


15 most of the State convictions, like most convictions in -­


16 in general, are going to rest on -- on guilty pleas. It


17 just is not realistic to assume that Congress assumed a


18 due diligence system which was going to require a State


19 defendant immediately to start a collateral attack on a


20 guilty plea. I mean, if -- if there -- if there were


21 reasons for the collateral attack that seemed strong and


22 worthwhile, he wouldn't have been entering the guilty


23 plea. 


24  And it seems to me that if we're going to


25 measure due diligence from the date of conviction, most


Page 27 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 convictions resting on pleas, as a practical matter under 

2 your system, a conviction that rests on a plea is never 

3 going to be subject to a timely challenge for purposes of 

4 applying 2255. Is -- is that a fair comment, or have I -­

5 have I missed something? 

6  MR. HIMMELFARB: No. We -- we disagree, Justice 

7 Souter. And if I could, I'd like to say a little bit 

8 about the -- the proposal you made when petitioner's 

9 counsel was up here about when the diligence could be 

10 measured from. And I think your suggestion was that it 

11 could be measured from the time of the Federal conviction 

12 or -­

13  JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

14  MR. HIMMELFARB: -- perhaps the time that 

15 Federal charges are brought because at that time, that's 

16 when the defendant has the incentive to -- to challenge 

17 the State conviction. We obviously prefer that 

18 interpretation to the one offered by petitioner. 

19  We think the two that we offer are better than 

20 that one for a couple of reasons. The first is that we 

21 think that our two -­

22  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, would you comment 

23 specifically on your preferred position which starts at 

24 the very -- as I understand it, starts at the earliest 

25 date, which would be the date of the State conviction? 

Page 28 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  MR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. We think that's


2 consistent with the text because the diligence has to be


3 connected in some way to the facts supporting the claim,


4 and we think you could take the view that in a case of


5 this type, particularly given the diligence requirement,


6 the facts supporting the claim either means the facts


7 supporting the State claim or it means the vacatur of the


8 State conviction. 


9  JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but isn't it -- I guess my


10 problem is isn't -- isn't it a sense -- isn't your


11 argument for a sense of diligence which is really other­


12 wordly? At the moment the defendant's conviction based


13 upon his plea becomes final, it simply is unrealistic to


14 expect that any defendant would have an incentive to


15 attack that conviction. And -- and the result, it seems


16 to me, of -- of your position, your preferred position, is


17 if -- if diligence is measured from that moment, that no


18 defendant will ever be diligent because no defendant will


19 ever have an incentive at that point to be diligent. 


20  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, Justice Souter, the -- we


21 think that there's a -- a textual problem with the


22 interpretation you're offering because it doesn't tie


23 diligence to facts supporting a claim.


24  JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how about the one you're


25 offering? Before you tell me why mine is bad, tell me why


Page 29 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 yours does not suffer the -- the -- at least I think, the


2 objection that I've -- I've raised?


3  MR. HIMMELFARB: Because it avoids the problem


4 that you could have a Federal conviction long after, years


5 or a decade or a more after, the State conviction. And on


6 -- on your view, you would not be -- the -- the petitioner


7 would not be required to challenge a State conviction for


8 a decade or more until after -­


9  JUSTICE SOUTER: That's -- that's right. But


10 why is the requirement on your reading to challenge it


11 promptly after it is entered in these plea situations, not


12 a just totally unrealistic requirement that will never be


13 met and will result in a consequence that all State


14 convictions, resting upon pleas, will be, in effect,


15 insulated from later collateral attack when -- under -­


16 for purpose of 2255?


17  MR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Souter, an argument


18 along those lines was actually raised in Daniels itself


19 and rejected by the Court. And essentially what the Court


20 said is that whatever the incentives may be at the time of


21 the State conviction, the remedies are available, the


22 procedures are available. And if a defendant does not


23 avail himself of those remedies and procedures, at a


24 minimum he will know that so long as his State conviction


25 remains on the books, if he goes out and commits another


Page 30 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 crime, he runs a risk that he will be subject to an


2 enhanced sentence based on the fact that he's committed


3 the prior crime. We think the same --


4  JUSTICE SOUTER: So you say we're all stuck with


5 that.


6  MR. HIMMELFARB: I think that -­


7  JUSTICE SOUTER: You don't mind, but -- if -- if


8 you think -- if you think there's anything to my


9 objection, you're in effect saying, too late.


10  MR. HIMMELFARB: I think that the arguments


11 against your objection weigh in favor of our


12 interpretation. 


13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure I agree


14 with your argument, but I suppose one answer to Justice


15 Souter is that you get the longer of (1) or (4), so that


16 you would always get at least 1 year. If the -- if the


17 State conviction was 10 years prior to the Federal


18 conviction and he waited and did nothing, I take it, he


19 still has 1 year because he gets the longer of the two


20 provisions. 


21  MR. HIMMELFARB: That's right, Justice Kennedy. 


22  JUSTICE BREYER: It is right? Because I thought


23 that Justice Souter provided that, but you don't because


24 if you're relegated to (4) -- let's say it becomes final


25 quickly. If you're relegated to (4), what you're saying


Page 31 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 is the date on which the facts supporting the claim could 

2 have been discovered, if this is a conviction that took 

3 place 10 years earlier, you are saying the date on which 

4 those facts could have been discovered was 9 years earlier 

5 or whenever he could have brought it -- brought the claim 

6 in the -- in the State court. 

7  MR. HIMMELFARB: That's right. Under -­

8  JUSTICE BREYER: So, therefore, it is not true 

9 that he always has that year. 

10  MR. HIMMELFARB: No. Under paragraph 6(4), what 

11 you say is absolutely correct, as we see things. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

13  MR. HIMMELFARB: But the -- the limitation 

14 period under AEDPA runs from the latest of the four 

15 dates -­

16  JUSTICE BREYER: But if the date of judgment 

17 became final prior to the running of (4), then he would 

18 not have a year. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's true. 

20  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 

21  Now, my question actually is the -- aside from 

22 Justice Souter's practical point, it seemed to me that the 

23 language here is different from Daniels and different in 

24 the other cases. The language is the date on which facts 

25 supporting the claim or claims presented could have been 

Page 32 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 discovered. And facts supporting the claim prior to there


2 being a claim are not facts supporting the claim. And


3 therefore, it seems as if it would run no later than the


4 moment when he presents the Federal claim. No earlier


5 than that could it run. So you have a year from the time


6 that you present the Federal claim. At that point, all


7 those facts that could have been discovered earlier, now


8 he has a year to call them to the attention of the court.


9  And of course, for reasons that you point out,


10 this is certainly a fact that could have been discovered


11 earlier. He could have brought his motion long before. 


12  So what's wrong with that? It combines the


13 practical reason that Justice Souter mentioned with the


14 language of the statute.


15  MR. HIMMELFARB: Let me comment on the language,


16 if I could. If one were to read the phrase, facts


17 supporting the claim, completely in isolation, keeping in


18 mind only Daniels, but ignoring the broader statutory


19 context and the statutory purpose, it might well be the


20 case that the better reading is that the facts supporting


21 the claim is the vacatur of the State conviction not the


22 factual basis for the State claim. 


23  But if you take into account the broader


24 statutory context and statutory purpose, in particular if


25 you take into account the due diligence requirement, we


Page 33 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 think the better reading is that facts supporting the 

2 claim, in the context of this limitation provision, is the 

3 factual basis for the State claim. It is true -­

4  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I -- I thought that you 

5 conceded at the outset that the facts supporting the claim 

6 is the vacatur. I -- I thought that you opened up with 

7 that. And it -- it -­

8  MR. HIMMELFARB: No, Justice Kennedy. What I 

9 was agreeing to was the idea that a vacatur of a 

10 conviction is a fact because in the lower court decision, 

11 there seems to be some reliance on the idea that that's 

12 not a fact at all. But in responding to Justice Breyer's 

13 question -­

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the minute -- the minute 

15 that you -- you say that, it -- it seems to me that you 

16 have to accept the petitioner's argument. 

17  MR. HIMMELFARB: I don't think so, Justice 

18 Kennedy, and here's why. It is a true in a case of this 

19 type that the facts supporting the claim -- excuse me -­

20 the factual basis for the State claim is not the facts 

21 supporting the Federal claim in a direct or proximate or 

22 immediate or sufficient sense. It is the facts supporting 

23 the Federal claim in an indirect, a but for, a once 

24 removed, or a necessary sense. If a defendant has served 

25 his State sentence, he's been sentenced to an enhanced 

Page 34 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 Federal sentence and he wants to challenge his Federal


2 sentence and he's armed with a factual predicate for a


3 State claim, so long as he takes the intermediate step of


4 going into Federal court and obtaining a vacatur of the


5 conviction, he can challenge his Federal sentence. 


6  JUSTICE BREYER: I'm certainly not taking -­


7 advocating the -- the defendant's position. I'm


8 advocating the position as follows.


9  Suppose it were not a vacatur. Suppose it were


10 a DNA test, and suppose it were a fact that the DNA test


11 identified a different perpetrator of a long-gone State


12 crime and it was definite. 


13  Now, if no one thought of running that DNA test,


14 although they should have, until 4 years after the Federal


15 conviction, he's out of luck. He has 1 year from the


16 Federal conviction, and that 1 year he has to, during that


17 year, do everything, including bringing facts into being,


18 such as the result of the DNA test, that he had not


19 previously done. And that's consistent with the language. 


20 It avoids Justice Souter's practical problem, and it does


21 not impose an unreasonable burden on the Government, I


22 wouldn't think, because he has just a year from


23 conviction. 


24  MR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Breyer, under our view,


25 the hypothetical you just gave would be one where a timely


Page 35 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 2255 motion could be filed. If the DNA evidence were


2 discoverable in the exercise of due diligence only more


3 than a year after the Federal conviction became final such


4 that the defendant would not be within paragraph 6(1), he


5 would be able to file a timely 2255 motion under paragraph


6 6(4) if, within a year from the date that the DNA evidence


7 was discoverable through the exercise of due diligence, he


8 filed his State motion to get his State conviction


9 vacated, and allowing tolling of the period while the


10 State motion is pending, then filed his Federal motion


11 within that same 1-year period, he would be able to file a


12 timely 2255 motion. That's under our primary


13 interpretation. 


14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: From your answer, I take it


15 then you would agree with Judge Black in the Eleventh


16 Circuit that equitable tolling would apply. He goes to


17 State court within the year after his Federal conviction


18 becomes final. The State court is sitting on it for 2


19 years. The limitation, I take it from what you said,


20 would be tolled during that time.


21  MR. HIMMELFARB: That's right, Justice Ginsburg. 


22 Under our primary interpretation, there would be tolling


23 during the 1-year period of the time while the motion, the


24 State motion, is pending in State court. 


25  Our alternative interpretation doesn't depend on


Page 36 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 tolling because it doesn't begin to run until the vacatur 

2 of the State conviction could have been obtained. So it's 

3 just the -- the time while the State motion is pending is 

4 just excluded from the calculation as a matter of course 

5 under our second interpretation. 

6  JUSTICE STEVENS: May -- may I ask you sort of a 

7 general background question? As I understand your basic 

8 position, if the defendant lets things sit for too long, 

9 he loses the right to challenge the State conviction. On 

10 the -- and -- and what's -- what's at stake is an 

11 enhancement based on the -- on the prior conviction. Is 

12 there ever a time when the Federal Government loses the 

13 right to use a very old conviction for enhancement 

14 purposes? 

15  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, under -- under the 

16 guidelines, depending upon the -- the length of the prison 

17 term, I think very old convictions are not counted at all. 

18  JUSTICE STEVENS: Is that right? 

19  MR. HIMMELFARB: Yes. So -- so the length of 

20 time from the date of the State conviction to the time of 

21 the Federal sentencing can have a bearing upon what 

22 sentence he's going -­

23  JUSTICE STEVENS: Whether he gets the --

24  JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that also true under the 

25 Armed Career Criminal Act cases?

1  MR. HIMMELFARB: I -- I don't believe it is, 

2 Justice Souter. I don't think there's any kind of time 

3 limitation there the way there is in the guidelines. 

4  The -- the --

5  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure which way that 

6 cuts. In a -- in a sense, if that set of old convictions 

7 is out of the way, then you won't be troubled by the loss 

8 of records problem. 

9  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, that -- I think that's 

10 actually a critical point, Justice Kennedy, because our 

11 view is that a -- a State defendant should be required to 

12 challenge his State conviction at the earliest possible 

13 opportunity, and in most cases that will be soon after his 

14 conviction in State court because that will be the time 

15 when he knows about the basis for his State claim. If he 

16 does that, by the time he gets to the Federal sentencing, 

17 you're not going to have the issue in this case because 

18 all will agree that that vacated State conviction can't be 

19 counted towards his Federal sentence. So that's one of 

20 the virtues of the interpretation we offer. It avoids 

21 this circumstance entirely. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you're not -- you're not 

23 insisting on that super diligence because you say, well, 

24 in every case he has at least a year to begin to try to 

25 undo the State conviction.

1  MR. HIMMELFARB: That -- that's right, Justice


2 Ginsburg. We agree with that.


3  The -- the purpose of AEDPA's limitation


4 provision, to use this Court's language in Duncan v.


5 Walker, is to reduce the potential for delay on the road


6 to finality by restricting the time that a prospective


7 habeas petitioner has in which to seek habeas review. We


8 think petitioner's interpretation is inconsistent with


9 that purpose not only because it permits a delay in


10 challenging the State conviction and, as a consequence, in


11 challenging the Federal sentence, but because it


12 encourages it. As I mentioned before, the longer a


13 prisoner waits to challenge his State conviction, other


14 things being the same, the greater the likelihood of


15 success either because the necessary records that the


16 State would need to defend the judgment are unavailable or


17 because the State prosecutor has less of an incentive to


18 defend it than he might have while the sentence was still


19 being served. 


20  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Recently I -- I lost my


21 luggage. I had to go to the lost and found at the


22 airline, and the lady said has my plane landed yet. 


23  (Laughter.) 


24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was kind of stopped by that


25 question.

1  It seems to me this case is something like that. 


2 I mean, this is just not a question the -- the defendant


3 asks until the Federal conviction arrives, which I -­


4 which I suppose that argues for your 1-year -­


5  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, our -­


6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- position, but it just seems


7 to me that the purpose of this doesn't begin to run until


8 he's been sentenced. And then he has to go through all


9 the -- the questioning as -- as to whether or not his


10 prior conviction is -- can be set aside, and he has to go


11 to State court to do that.


12  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, the -- the important


13 point is that -- we think is that petitioner's


14 interpretation doesn't work because it gives a defendant


15 an indefinite period to challenge his State conviction,


16 and the only diligence that's required under his


17 interpretation is that you have to exercise diligence in


18 seeing whether the motion to vacate your State conviction


19 was granted whenever it was filed. 


20  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that may be but that also


21 may be what it says. I -- I don't follow your


22 interpretation of what is the meaning of facts supporting


23 the claim or claims. I mean, once you say that the facts


24 supporting the claim is the vacatur of the -- of the State


25 conviction, I mean, it seems that's the end of it. 


Page 40 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well -­

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and as for due 

3 diligence, yes, it doesn't seem to make much sense in that 

4 context, but as pointed out by your friend on the other 

5 side, it makes sense in all other contexts and -- and you 

6 don't expect the language to be applicable all the time. 

7 So what's wrong with that? 

8  MR. HIMMELFARB: What's wrong with it is that we 

9 think it's not only inconsistent with the basic principle 

10 embodied in AEDPA's statute of limitations, we think it's 

11 inconsistent with the very idea of a statute of 

12 limitations. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: It may well be, but that's how 

14 they wrote it. I'm talking about the word facts. 

15  MR. HIMMELFARB: Justice -­

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: How can this be a fact 

17 supporting the -- you -- you want us to say a fact 

18 supporting the conviction includes the facts that lead up 

19 to the facts supporting the conviction or -- or supporting 

20 the claim. 

21  MR. HIMMELFARB: Justice Scalia, if the Court 

22 rejects our view that the facts supporting the claim under 

23 paragraph 6(4) as the factual basis for the State claim, 

24 we think it should still reject petitioner's 

25 interpretation and should adopt our alternative 

Page 41 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 interpretation which is not subject to that objection


2 because our alternative interpretation assumes that the


3 facts supporting the claim is the vacatur of the State


4 conviction. But in light of the due diligence requirement


5 at the end of paragraph 6(4), the question is when could


6 that vacatur have been obtained and thus discovered


7 through the exercise of due diligence. 


8  JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, you're saying


9 due diligence applies to an extraneous fact when you


10 could, in the simple sense, discover it. It applies to a


11 generated fact when you could have generated it.


12  MR. HIMMELFARB: That's absolutely our position,


13 Justice Souter. 


14  JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask sort of a broad


15 question? Am I correct in assuming that this really isn't


16 the most important case we ever heard because it only


17 affects a handful of enhancements that don't really affect


18 the basic conviction or sentence; and secondly, that it's


19 clear that the -- from both the text of the statute and


20 whatever we know about the legislative history, that it's


21 a problem Congress never even thought about? 


22  MR. HIMMELFARB: As to your first question,


23 Justice Stevens, one -- one would think that this is a


24 little bit of an unusual situation and you don't see too


25 many cases where it arises. Perhaps surprisingly, though,


Page 42 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 there are quite a few reported decisions where this


2 arises. There is a 2 to 1 circuit split on this question. 


3 There are some district courts from other circuits that


4 have weighed in. I believe there may be three or four


5 certiorari petitions pending in this Court from the


6 Eleventh Circuit that raise the same question. 


7  As to whether Congress ever considered this


8 situation, I'm not aware of anything in the legislative


9 history that is an affirmative indication that it did. It


10 could well be -­


11  JUSTICE STEVENS: And certainly they would have


12 phrased the statute one way or the other more clearly. 


13 They could have done that.


14  MR. HIMMELFARB: That could well be, but of


15 course, it wouldn't be the -- the first time the Court


16 confronted a situation where there's a statutory text and


17 there's a set of facts that Congress didn't necessarily


18 consider when it was writing the text. 


19  So we think our -- either our primary or our


20 fall-back position is preferable to petitioner's


21 interpretation for the fundamental reason that his


22 interpretation does not require diligence. It enables the


23 defendant to extend the limitation period through his own


24 actions, and we think it's simply foreign to the whole


25 notion of statutes of limitations to say that the


Page 43 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 limitation period can be determined by actions that are


2 within the prisoner's control.


3  The court of appeals -­


4  JUSTICE BREYER: You certainly -- wouldn't you


5 be making the opposite argument if it were a DNA test? If


6 it were a DNA test, you would certainly be arguing that


7 even though the results didn't come into existence until


8 32 years after his Federal conviction, that he could have


9 discovered it 38 years before because he could have asked


10 that the test then be performed.


11  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, Justice Breyer, the


12 question of whether a fact supporting a claim could have


13 been discovered through the exercise of due diligence is a


14 very fact-specific question which -­


15  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Then -- then once


16 you admit that, you're going to have to find a difference


17 between this and the DNA test, or your position here, if


18 adopted, will catch you out there.


19  MR. HIMMELFARB: No. We don't think so because


20 we think that the analysis should be the same for this


21 case as it is for your typical case involving a statute of


22 limitations with a discovery rule. The question is on the


23 facts of this case, when could the factual basis of the


24 claim been discovered given the totality of the


25 information available to the plaintiff through the


Page 44 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 exercise of due diligence. So we think it's precisely the


2 same situation. 


3  JUSTICE SCALIA: But you're still asking us -- I


4 mean, even -- even in your fall-back position -- your -­


5 your principal position asks us to -- to play games with


6 the -- with the word facts, and your fall-back position


7 asks us to play games with the word discovered. You want


8 us to read discovered to mean either discovered or


9 obtained, which discovered just doesn't mean obtained. It


10 just doesn't. 


11  MR. HIMMELFARB: Well, you're right, Justice


12 Scalia. The fall-back position presumes the correctness


13 of petitioner's interpretation of facts supporting the


14 claim. 


15  JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb.


16  Mr. Reichman, you have, I think, 8 minutes left. 


17 I'm not -- I'm sure you don't really need all 8.


18  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF COURTLAND REICHMAN


19  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


20  MR. REICHMAN: I hope not.


21  The Government's position boils down to this. 


22 They're advocating for the statute they want, not the


23 statute they have. This statute says the fact that could


24 have been discovered with exercise of due diligence. And


25 once -- as this Court -- several Justices have recognized


Page 45 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 once you admit that the vacatur is a fact, the


2 Government's entire argument unravels because what the


3 Government would have -- this Court holds -- is that the


4 facts supporting the claim is exactly what it held it


5 couldn't be in Daniels. 


6  The -- underlying the Government's argument is,


7 I think, a principle that -- that does not make sense. 


8 It's that the State can't be trusted to handle the


9 challenges to prior convictions. I think that is not only


10 against experience. It also cuts against this Court's


11 decisions, in particular, about Daniels. It talked about


12 the State having a strong interest in maintaining its


13 convictions. 


14  The idea about AEDPA and finality I think is


15 also important. To answer your question, Justice Stevens,


16 no, this is not the most important case this Court has


17 ever heard. And I think that that ties into an important


18 point. To use my rough numbers, we're talking about at


19 this point with the six States, less than 10 guys that


20 might be in this 10-year scenario per year. I think


21 probably the number is more like three people per year. 


22 And if the Brackett court, the court on the front lines


23 down there in the district court, the First Circuit is


24 right, we're talking about the results of the Government's


25 rule to be that thousands of placeholder petitions will be


Page 46 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 filed so that petitioners don't lose their rights to


2 challenge their Federal sentence based on the vacatur of


3 their prior sentences. And when -- when I think about


4 what serves the ends of the statute and finality overall,


5 I think that to prolong all these other cases, these


6 thousands of cases --


7  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why would you need the


8 placeholder if the rule were, as Judge Black said it


9 should be, that if you go to the State court within the 1


10 year after your Federal conviction becomes final, then the


11 time that you are in the State court the statute will be


12 tolled? If that's the rule, then you don't need any


13 placeholder filings.


14  MR. REICHMAN: Two responses to that. First, if


15 that is the rule, I'm not sure I read the Eleventh Circuit


16 to be so crisp on it that you definitely get tolling. I


17 think it was a case-by-case determination. And anytime


18 you're in a soft -- what I call soft equitable tolling


19 situation where you don't know for sure, that's going to


20 lead to placeholder petitions.


21  Alternatively, if we're talking about a rule


22 that's a hard equitable tolling rule, that is, there is


23 tolling every time there's the pendency of the State


24 petition, well, it seems to me that we are adding a


25 provision very expressly to the statute that doesn't


Page 47 

Alderson Reporting Company 
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400 Washington, DC 20005 



1 exist. 2244 has exactly that tolling provision, and that


2 is not in this -- in the 2255 provision. And this Court


3 would be adding it, and we don't think that is


4 appropriate. 


5  At the end of the day, there's been a question


6 about doesn't a tie go to the Government in this case


7 because of finality. That is, if both interpretations are


8 equally plausible, because of finality, doesn't it go to


9 the Government? Of course, you've heard me contest we


10 don't think it's a tie. We also don't think finality cuts


11 in the favor of the Government. 


12  But even assuming we have a tie, we think that


13 -- that should -- the tie goes to the petitioner because


14 this statute is recognized in Clay as in derogation of


15 common law, and statutes and derogation of common law are


16 to be strictly construed. 


17  Thank you. 


18  JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, Mr. Reichman.


19  The case is submitted. 


20  (Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the case in the


21 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
