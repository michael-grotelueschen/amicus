 JUSTICE STEVENS: We will now hear argument in 

Gonzales, et al. against Raich.

 General Clement.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court: 

Through the Controlled Substances Act, Congress 

has comprehensively regulated the national market in drugs 

with the potential for abuse. And with respect to 

Schedule I substances, like marijuana, that have both a 

high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical 

use in treatment, Congress categorically prohibits 

interstate trafficking outside the narrow and carefully 

controlled confines of federally approved research 

programs.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, Mr. Clement, the -- I 

think it is reasonably clear that Congress spoke very 

broadly in the Act, and the question, for me, turns on 

whether Lopez and Morrison dictate some concerns with its 

application in this context.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Justice 

O'Connor, I don't think either Lopez or Morrison casts any

doubt on the constitutionality of the Controlled 

Substances Act, and I think, in particular, that's because 

the decisions in Lopez and Morrison cited, with approval, 

cases like Darby and Wickard, and preserved those cases. 

And, of course, the concurring opinion of Justice Kennedy 

did so, as well.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, but in Wickard, of 

course, you had a wheat grower, a small farmer, and his 

wheat did, in part, go in the national market. You don't 

have that here. As I understand it, if California's law 

applies, then none of this home-grown for medical-use 

marijuana will be on any interstate market. And it is in 

the area of something traditionally regulated by states. 

So how do you distinguish Morrison? And how do you 

distinguish Lopez?

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice O'Connor, let me 

first say that I think it might be a bit optimistic to 

think that none of the marijuana that's produced 

consistent with California law would be diverted into the 

national market for marijuana. And, of course, the 

Controlled Substances Act is concerned, at almost every 

step of the Act, with a concern about diversion, both of 

lawful substances from medical to non-medical uses and 

from controlled substances under Schedule I into the 

national market.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, in looking at this 

broad challenge, do we have to assume that the State of 

California will enforce its law? I mean, if it turns out 

that it isn't and that marijuana is getting in the 

interstate market, that might be a different thing.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Justice 

O'Connor, on this record, I don't think that there's any 

reason to assume that California is going to have some 

sort of almost unnatural ability to keep one part of a 

fungible national drug market separate. And I think 

Congress, here, made important findings that you've 

alluded to, not just that there's a national market, not 

just that the intrastate and the interstate markets are 

linked, but that drugs are fungible, and that because 

drugs are fungible, it's simply not feasible, in Congress' 

words, to regulate and separately focus on only drugs that 

have traveled on interstate commerce.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, General Clement, what if 

we were to assume -- I'm not saying this is -- that the 

District Court could find that there is a narrow segment 

of the market in which they could prevent diversions, and 

they had -- say they made such findings. Would we have to 

disregard them, or say they were irrelevant?

 MR. CLEMENT: I think you would say they were 

irrelevant, Justice Stevens, and that's because --

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But then why do you need to 

rely on the possibility of diversion?

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, because I think it is a 

reality, in responding to Justice O'Connor's question -- I 

think that in -- obviously, in all of these commerce --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yeah, but in my hypothesis, 

it's a nonexistent reality.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, in your hypothetical -- and 

if I could turn to that -- I still think the analysis 

would not turn on whether or not the truth of the 

supposition that diversion could be prevented, because 

this Court, in a series of cases, including Darby, 

Wickard, Wirtz, and Perez, has made clear that the 

relevant focal point for analysis is not the individual 

plaintiff's activities and whether they have a substantial 

effect on interstate commerce, but whether the class of 

activities that Congress has decided to regulate has such 

a substantial effect. And, in this case, there's no 

question that the overall production, distribution, and 

possession of marijuana and other Schedule I substances 

has a profound effect on interstate commerce.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But it's not an interstate 

commerce that you want to foster. I mean, in these other 

-- in these other cases, Congress presumably wanted to 

foster interstate commerce in wheat, in Wickard v.

Filburn. Congress doesn't want interstate commerce in 

marijuana. And it seems rather ironic to appeal to the 

fact that home-grown marijuana would reduce the interstate 

commerce that you don't want to occur in order to regulate 

it. I mean, you know, doesn't that strike you as strange?

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, no, it doesn't, Justice 

Scalia, but let me respond in two ways. First of all, I 

think it's been clear, at least since the lottery case, 

that Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce 

includes the authority to prohibit items traveling in 

interstate commerce and to declare something contraband in 

interstate commerce.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Absolutely.

 MR. CLEMENT: And I would suggest that it is a 

perfectly rational exercise of Congress' judgement to 

treat marijuana and other Schedule I substances not just 

as contraband in interstate commerce, but as contraband 

simpliciter, as contraband for all purposes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's quite a different 

rational than from Wickard v. Filburn. I mean, it seems to me 

you're not -- you're not appealing to the fact that it has 

a substantial impact on interstate commerce. You're 

appealing to the fact that the power which Congress has to 

prohibit the use of goods carried in interstate commerce 

cannot effectively be implemented without this law.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think there's some truth 

to that, Justice Scalia, but let me say this. I think 

what I'm saying is, I'm taking the rational that this 

Court accepted in Wickard, and I'm applying it to a 

different regulatory regime. Here, Congress --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But you're applying it to the 

opposite kind of regulatory -- you're applying it to a 

regulatory regime in which the government wants to 

prohibit this subject -- substance from being sold or --

in interstate commerce. And if you just follow the litter 

-- letter of this law, this marijuana won't get into 

interstate commerce. In fact, it would reduce the demand 

for marijuana, because it would supply these local users 

and they wouldn't have to go into the interstate market.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Justice 

Stevens, if you took a look at the Controlled Substances 

Act, itself, and read it literally, you'd assume that 

there was absolutely no market, period, in Schedule I 

substances. But the reality is, there's a $10.5 billion 

market -- illegal market, albeit -- but market in 

marijuana in the United States, on an annual basis. So --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But to the extent that this 

statute has any impact, it will reduce the purchase in the 

interstate market and confine these to locally grown 

marijuana.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, first of all, Justice 

Stevens, that's only true if there will be no diversion, 

to get back to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Then I'm assuming -- my 

hypothetical is that California could pass a law that 

would prevent diversions from occurring.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, in the same way that the 

Federal Government has had trouble stamping out the 

marijuana market entirely, I think California is going to 

have parallel problems in absolutely preventing diversion.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But just --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I suppose some -- one answer 

to that case is the Perez case, with loan sharking.

 MR. CLEMENT: Oh, absolutely, Justice Kennedy. 

And, in that context, what this Court said is, even though 

it was focused on what was going to be an -- both in that 

case and generally, an interstate activity, Congress did 

not have to just look at the particular plaintiff's effect 

on interstate commerce, but, rather, the effect of the 

entire class of activities. And if I could --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, as Justice O'Connor 

brought out earlier, all those cases -- Wickard, Perez --

they all involve a commercial enterprise. And, here, 

we're told this is different, because nobody is buying 

anything, nobody is selling anything.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, Justice 

Ginsburg, I think the whole point of the Wickard case was 

to extend rationales that it applied previously to commerce 

to activity that the Court described as economic, but not 

commercial. And I think the production and distribution 

and possession of marijuana is economic in the same way 

that the production of wheat was in the Wickard case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you're -- no, I was going 

to -- your whole point, I take it, is that the two 

particular patients in this case are simply -- simply 

cannot be taken, for our purposes, as representative in 

the fact that they are getting the marijuana by, I think, 

growing it themselves or being given it. You're saying, 

you cannot take that fact as a fact from which to 

generalize in deciding this case.

 MR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Justice 

Souter, and that is the logic, not just of me, but of this 

Court's cases, in cases like Darby and Wickard and Wirtz 

and Perez. And I point to the Wickard case, in 

particular, only because it, too, involves a non-

commercial enterprise or a non-commercial production of --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I do take issue with 

that. As I read the record in Wickard, it involved a 

small farmer. A portion of his wheat went on the 

interstate market. It also was fed to cattle, which, in

turn, went on the interstate market. He used some of it 

himself, but part of it was commercial. I think Wickard 

can be distinguished on the facts.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice O'Connor, it could 

be -- I mean, any case can be distinguished on the facts, 

of course, but I think what's important is, this Court, in 

Wickard, itself, recognized that the case was -- it was 

only interesting because a portion of the regulated wheat 

involved wheat that was going to be consumed on the farm. 

And --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: The other portion is a matter 

of [inaudible] interstate commerce.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, that's true, Justice 

O'Connor, but this Court, basically, in its opinion, 

Justice Jackson, for the Court, put aside -- to one side 

all of the grain that was going to go in interstate 

commerce, since that's easy under our existing precedents. 

This case is only interesting, he said, because it 

involves wheat that's going to be consumed on the farm. 

And he specifically talked about both the wheat that would 

be fed to the animals, but also the wheat that would be 

consumed by the family. And what he said is, the intended 

disposition of the particular wheat wasn't clear from the 

record of the case. And, by that, I take him to mean that 

it wasn't relevant to the Court's analysis in upholding

the Agricultural Adjustment Act to the wheat at issue 

there. And it's important to recognize that the way the 

Agricultural Adjustment Act worked is, it applied to all 

the wheat that was grown in excess of the quota, and so it 

applied to the wheat that was used by the family for 

consumption of their own bread. And, nonetheless, this 

Court upheld that as a valid Commerce Clause regulation.

 And so I think, by parity of reasoning, all of 

the marijuana that's at issue and covered by the 

Controlled Substances Act, whether it's lawful under state 

law, whether it's involved in a market transaction or not, 

is fairly within the Congress' Commerce Clause --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And is --

MR. CLEMENT: -- authority.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- this a harder or easier 

case than Wickard when we know that, in Wickard, it was 

lawful to buy and sell wheat, and, here, it is unlawful to 

buy and sell marijuana?

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Kennedy --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does this make your case 

easier, in a sense, or --

MR. CLEMENT: I think it does, Justice Kennedy, 

because, as I said earlier, in responding to a question 

from Justice Scalia, I think if you're talking about a 

context where Congress has the undoubted power to prohibit

something in interstate commerce entirely, and has 

exercised that power, so it treats something as 

effectively contraband in interstate commerce, and then 

takes the complementary step, especially in light of the 

fungibility of the product, and says, "We're just going to 

treat this as contraband simpliciter." I think that 

judgement by Congress has a very definite link to 

interstate commerce and its unquestioned authority to 

regulate interstate commerce.

 And I do think there's a sense in which when 

Congress is regulating the price of something, there's 

certainly a temptation to excise out relatively small 

producers and for Congress to say, "Well, we can still 

have effective regulation if we regulate the vast majority 

of production." But with respect to something that's 

unlawful to have and is -- and has very significant risks 

precisely because it's unlawful, any little island of 

lawful possession of non-contraband marijuana, for 

example, poses a real challenge to the statutory regime.

 It would also, I think, frustrate Congress' goal 

in promoting health. And I think the clearest example of 

that is the fact that, to the extent there is anything 

beneficial, health-wise, in marijuana, it's THC, which has 

been isolated and provided in a pill form, and has been 

available as a Schedule III substance, called --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's --

MR. CLEMENT: -- Marinol.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- but there is, in this 

record, a showing that, for at least one of the two 

plaintiffs, there were some 30-odd drugs taken, none of 

them worked. This was the only one that would. And it --

Justice Souter asked you about these two plaintiffs. The 

law can't be made on the basis of those two plaintiffs. 

But let's suppose that you're right, generally. If there 

were to be a prosecution of any of the plaintiffs in this 

case, would there be any defense, if there were to be a 

federal prosecution?

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think we 

would take the position, based on our reading of the 

Oakland Cannabis case -- and, obviously, different 

justices on this Court read the opinion differently and 

had different views on the extent to which the medical-

necessity defense was foreclosed by that opinion -- I 

would imagine the Federal Government, in that case, if it 

took the unlikely step of bringing the prosecution in the 

first place, would be arguing that, on the authority of 

Oakland Cannabis, the medical-necessity defense was not 

available.

 But I think, in any event, what is important, at 

this point, is that we don't have a prosecution; we have

an affirmative effort to strike down the Controlled 

Substances Act in an injunctive action. And I think, in 

that context, certainly Justice Souter is right, that this 

Court's precedents make clear that one doesn't consider 

only the individual's conduct, but the entire class of 

activities that's at issue.

 I think, in this regard, it's also worth 

emphasizing that a deeper flaw in the Respondent's 

argument, that California law is somehow relevant here or 

the fact that their conduct is lawful under California 

law, is that there's a mismatch between what California 

law makes lawful and what might be considered relevant for 

arguing that there's an attenuated effect on interstate 

commerce. Because the California law makes the possession 

of marijuana for medical use lawful under state law, 

without regard to whether that marijuana has been involved 

in a cash transaction or has crossed state lines.

 And so, if Respondents are right on their 

Commerce Clause theory, I don't see how they can be right 

because their conduct is lawful under state law or because 

their -- that marijuana use is medical. If they're right, 

then I think their analysis would extend to recreational 

use of marijuana, as well as medical use of marijuana, and 

would extend to every state in the nation, not just --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I think --

 MR. CLEMENT: -- those states that made it

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't it depend on how you 

define the "relevant class of activities"? Is it the 

entire class that Congress ought to regulate, or is it a 

narrower class, in which the Plaintiffs contend that the 

statute cannot constitutionally be applied to a particular 

very narrowly defined class? And is it ever permissible 

to define the class narrowly to escape a -- the broad 

argument that you make?

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I don't think that is 

permissible, Justice Stevens. I think that's what this 

Court's cases in Wirtz, in Darby, in Wickard --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So you're saying that this 

statute could never have an unconstitutional application.

 MR. CLEMENT: Under the Commerce Clause, I --

that's exactly right, that would be our position. It is 

constitutional on its face, and it -- and because of that 

line of authority, an as-applied challenge can be brought, 

but the legal test that's applied in the as-applied 

challenge is one that considers the constitutionality of 

the statute as a whole --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: But, in Morrison, did the 

Court's opinion not say that Congress cannot justify 

Commerce Cause -- Clause legislation by using a long but-

for causal chain from the activity in question to an

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Which cuts against what 

you're saying.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, with respect, I don't think 

so. And I'd say two things about it. One, this Court, in 

Morrison and Lopez, was very important to emphasize --

thought it very important to emphasize two things: 

one, that the activity there was non-economic in a way 

that differentiated it, even from Wickard; and, second, 

the Court also made it clear that the regulation that 

there -- there was not essential to the effectiveness of 

an overall regulatory scheme. And I think, on both 

points, this case is on the constitutional side of the 

line that separates the Lopez and the Morrison case.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: The argument on the other 

side is that this limited exception is a non-economic use 

-- growing for personal use, under prescription --

MR. CLEMENT: I understand that -- I understand 

that's their argument, Justice O'Connor, but I don't 

understand how this Court, in Lopez, could have said that 

Wickard involved non-economic activity if this activity is

not also covered. You're talking about --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Involved economic activity.

 MR. CLEMENT: I'm sorry if I misspoke. Economic 

activity. Because what you're talking about here is the 

possession, the manufacture, the distribution of a 

valuable commodity for which there is a ready --

unfortunately, a ready market, albeit an illicit market.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we rule for the Respondents 

in this case, do you think the street price of marijuana 

would go up or down in California?

 MR. CLEMENT: I would be speculating, Justice 

Kennedy, but I think the price would go down. And I think 

that what -- and that, in a sense, is consistent with the 

government's position, which is to say, when the 

government thinks that something is dangerous, it tries to 

prohibit it. Part of the effort of prohibiting it is 

going to lead to a black market, where the prohibition 

actually would force the price up. And there is a sense 

in which this regulation, although not primarily designed 

as a price regulation -- the Controlled Substance Act, I 

think, does have the effect of increasing the price for 

marijuana in a way that stamps down demand and limits the 

-- and in a way that reduces demand. And I think that's 

all consistent with Congress' judgement here. 

And if I could return for a second to the point

about Marinol, what's important there is that the process 

of manufacturing of Marinol, and isolating the one helpful 

component, does two things. One, the manufacturing 

process allows there to be a safe use for one of the 

components in marijuana. But it also provides an 

unambiguous hook for Congress to exercise its Commerce 

Clause authority. And yet the overall regime of trying to 

get people to use more healthful substances, and not use 

things like crude marijuana that have harmful effects, is 

undermined if Congress can't also address that which is 

more harmful, but is distinct only because it is capable 

of being locally produced. And that's exactly what crude 

marijuana is.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: In other words, the statute is 

-- it trumps the independent judgement of the physicians 

who prescribe it for the patients at issue in this case.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think, in responding to 

that, Justice Stevens, I would say, obviously, for 

purposes of federal law, the idea of medical marijuana is 

something of an oxymoron, because the Federal Government 

treats it as a Schedule I substance. Now, notwithstanding 

that, some doctors may make a different judgement about a 

particular patient; but that's something that this Court, 

I think, has previously understood, that the federal 

regulatory regime does not allow individual patients or

doctors to exempt themselves out of that regime.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

 MR. CLEMENT: I think that's the import of the 

Rutherford decision with Laetrile. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think there could be 

any state of facts on which a judicial tribunal could 

disagree with the finding of Congress that there's no 

acceptable medical use? Say they had a -- say there was a 

judicial hearing on which they made a contrary finding. 

Would we have to ignore that? Would we have to follow the 

congressional finding or the judicial finding if that 

happened?

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, it depends on the exact 

hypothetical you have in mind. I think the -- the 

judicial finding that I think would be appropriate, and 

this Court would not have to ignore in any way, is a 

finding by the D.C. Circuit that, in a particular case 

where there's a rescheduling effort before the FDA, that 

the underlying judgement of the FDA refusing to reschedule 

is invalid, arbitrary, capricious. That's the way to go 

after the finding that marijuana is a Schedule I substance 

without a valid medical use in treatment. This is not a 

situation in -- and your hypothetical might respond to a 

different statute that raised a harder question, where 

Congress made such a medical finding, and then just left

it there without any mechanism to adjust the finding for 

changing realities. But, here, Congress made it clear 

that a process remains open to reschedule marijuana in a 

way that gets it onto Schedule II or Schedule III.

 And I think it's wrong to assume that there's 

any inherent hostility to the substances at issue here. I 

mean, the FDA, for example, rescheduled Marinol from 

Schedule II to Schedule III in a way that had the effect 

of making it easier to prescribe and more available. But 

I think what's going on with the FDA is an effort to try 

to counterbalance the risk for abuse, the risk for 

diversion, with these other considerations of getting safe 

medicine --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have there --

MR. CLEMENT: -- available to patients --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- have there been any 

applications to change the schedule for marijuana to the 

FDA?

 MR. CLEMENT: There have been a number of those 

petitions that have been filed. There was one recently 

rejected, I think as recently as 2001; it may be 1999. 

There was also a series of, kind of, a four- or five-

iteration effort to change the rescheduling that 

culminated in a D.C. Circuit opinion in the early '90s. 

So there's definitely been these efforts. But on the

current state of the -- of the record, there just is not a 

justification for changing the schedule.

 And I think both of the briefs talked a little 

bit about the Institute of Medicine's study about the 

medical efficacy of marijuana. And I think one thing 

that's important to keep in mind that that study comes to 

a conclusion about is, whatever benefits there may be for 

the individual components in marijuana, that smoked --

smoked marijuana itself really doesn't have any future as 

medicine, because -- and that's true, I think, for two 

reasons. One, there's something like 400 different 

chemical components in crude marijuana that one would 

smoke, and it's -- it just, sort of, belies any logic that 

all 400 of those would be helpful. And a big part of the 

process of medicine, generally, is to take raw, crude 

material that somebody could grow in their garden, and 

actually have people who do this for a living get involved 

in a process of synthesizing and isolating the beneficial 

components, and then manufacturing and making that 

available. 

The second reason that smoked marijuana doesn't 

have much of a future as medicine is, as I think people 

understand, smoking is harmful; and that's true of 

tobacco, but it's also true of marijuana. And so the idea 

that smoked marijuana would be an effective delivery

device for medicine, I think, is also something that 

really doesn't have any future as medicine.

 What does have a future for medicine, of course, 

is an effort to synthesize and isolate the beneficial 

component. That's been done with Marinol. It is true 

that some people have difficulty tolerating the pill form 

that Marinol is available in. And there's ongoing 

research to try to figure out different ways to deliver 

that substance. But there is, in a sense, a little bit of 

a -- and the Institute of Medicine's study has about five 

pages discussing Marinol, and it makes the point that 

there's something of a tradeoff. Because one of the 

downsides of Marinol, as opposed to marijuana, is that it 

takes longer to get into the bloodstream. But that's also 

one of the reasons why the FDA has made a judgement that 

Marinol is less subject to abuse, because it takes longer 

to get into the drug-stream, and so it doesn't have the 

characteristic of street drugs that tend to be abused, 

which is a very quick delivery time between the taking of 

the substance and the time that it has an effect on the 

system.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back to your point a 

few minutes ago about -- it was, sort of, a categoric 

point -- you, in effect, said, "If this argument succeeds 

with respect to medical use of marijuana, the next

argument is going to be recreational use, and there's no 

real way to distinguish between them." Wouldn't this be a 

way to distinguish between them? That in deciding what 

class you are going to -- or what subclass you're going to 

consider from which to generalize, you simply ask the 

question, "What good reasons are there to define a 

subclass this way?"

 In this particular case, the good reasons to 

define a subclass of medical usage are the benefits --

whether you accept the evidence is another thing -- but 

the benefits which the doctors say that, under present 

circumstances, you can get from smoking it, as opposed to 

taking the synthesized drug.

 There's no such argument, I would guess, in 

favor of recreational marijuana usage as a separate 

category. And, for that reason, isn't there a -- isn't 

there a good reason to categorize this as narrowly as the 

Respondents are doing here, just medical usage, without 

any risk of generalizing to recreational usage?

 MR. CLEMENT: With respect, Justice Souter, I 

don't think that it would be a good idea for this Court to 

get on a path of starting to second-guess Congress' 

judgement about defining a class of activities --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That may -- oh, that may be, 

but it seems to me that that's a separate argument,

because you're -- you were arguing before that if you 

recognize medical usage, you don't have any way of drawing 

the line against private recreational usage. And I'm 

suggesting that you do have a reason for drawing that 

line, and it's the benefit for medical usage, if you 

accept the evidence; whereas, there is no reason to 

categorize recreational usage separately, and that seems 

to me a category argument, rather than a respect-for-

Congress argument.

 MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Souter, I have no 

doubt that this Court could draw a line. I think it would 

find it very difficult to police that line over the broad 

variety of cases. I think it would find it every bit as 

frustrating as policing the line in Hammer against 

Dagenhart that this Court abandoned in Darby.

 With that, I'd like to reserve my time for 

rebuttal.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Barnett.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDY E. BARNETT

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

 MR. BARNETT: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court:

 I have two points to make. First, the class of 

activities involved in this case are non-economic and 

wholly intrastate. Second, the federal prohibition of

this class of activities it not essential -- is not an 

essential part of a larger regulatory scheme that would be 

undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.

 If you accept the government's contrary 

contentions on either of these two points, Ashcroft v. 

Raich will replace Wickard v. Filburn as the most far-

reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over 

intrastate activity.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, on your first point, 

can't we infer from the fact that there's an enormous 

market, commercial market, for any given commodity, that 

simple possession of that commodity is a form of 

participation in the market?

 MR. BARNETT: It can be, or it might not be. If 

you possess an item that came from the market or is going 

to the market, simple possession could easily be a part of 

the marketplace. But if you're in possession of an item 

that you've made, yourself, that is disconnected from the 

market -- it didn't come from the market and it's not 

going to the market --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it's fungible.

 MR. BARNETT: That -- the fungibility issue is 

in this case, but the -- but a -- the fact that a good is 

fungible does not make it a market good, and it does not 

make the possession of that good an economic activity. Or --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you know, Congress has 

applied this theory in other contexts. One is the 

protection of endangered species. Congress has made it 

unlawful to possess ivory, for example. It doesn't matter 

whether you got it lawfully, or not; or eagle feathers, 

the mere possession of it, whether you got it through 

interstate commerce or not. And Congress' reasoning is, 

"We can't tell whether it came through interstate commerce 

or not, and to try to prove that is just beyond our 

ability; and, therefore, it is unlawful to possess it, 

period."

 Now, are those -- are those laws, likewise, 

unconstitutional, as going beyond Congress' commerce 

power?

 MR. BARNETT: Not if they're an essential part 

of a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut, 

unless those activities are reached.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why is that different 

from this?

 MR. BARNETT: Because this class of activities 

-- because it's been isolated by the State of California, 

and is policed by the State of California, so that it's 

entirely separated from the market --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Isolated and -- I understand 

that there are some communes that grow marijuana for the

medical use of all of the members of the communes.

 MR. BARNETT: That class of activities is not 

before the Court. That is actually before --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but it's before the Court 

when you -- when you raise the policing of the problem by 

California, and saying it's not a -- it's not a real 

problem, you brought it before the Court.

 MR. BARNETT: But that class of activities could 

be -- could be -- if this Court limits its ruling to the 

class of activities that is before the Court, that class 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is -- which is what?

 MR. BARNETT: Which is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: An individual grower?

 MR. BARNETT: An individual who is growing it 

for her -- him- or herself, who has -- or has a caregiver 

growing it for her --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Gee, what basis --

MR. BARNETT: -- for --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- what basis is there to draw 

it that narrowly? I mean, I guess if we -- we could say 

people whose last name begins with a Z. You know, that 

would narrow the category, too. But why does -- why does 

that make any sense?

makes sense because we are talking about a classification 

of activities that has been identified by the State of 

California, and which is rational to distinguish from --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, but California hasn't 

identified individual growers. Communes are okay, as far 

as California law is concerned.

 MR. BARNETT: Well, it's not entirely clear 

whether communes are okay, as far as the California laws 

are concerned.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why wouldn't it be?

 MR. BARNETT: Because if, in fact, commercial 

activity is taking place, if buying and selling is taking 

place --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, they're not buying and 

selling. I mean, you can't prove they're buying and 

selling. There are just a whole lot of people there, with 

alleged medical needs.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I don't understand. Is 

there any authority in the commerce cases for -- an X, 

which is there in the middle of a state, and it doesn't 

move one way or the other -- now, Congress' power does 

extend to the X if the state doesn't say something about 

the X. But if the state says something about the X, then 

Congress' power does not extend to it. That's hard for me 

to accept, because I don't see -- whether it's commerce or

not commerce, whether it affects something or doesn't

with whether the state separately regulates it, and I 

can't find any support at all for that in any case.

 MR. BARNETT: The support would come from the 

exception to Lopez and Morrison that the government is 

urging that the Court adopt, that the Congress can reach 

non-economic activity that's intrastate, that's wholly 

intrastate, if doing so is essential to a larger 

regulatory scheme that would be undercut if they can't 

reach it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, here, they say -- look, I 

take it you're using this because I was going to ask you. 

You know, he grows heroin, cocaine, tomatoes that are 

going to have genomes in them that could, at some point, 

lead to tomato children that will eventually affect 

Boston. You know, we can -- oil that's never, in fact, 

being used, but we want an inventory of it, federally.

MR. BARNETT: Well --

going to get around all those examples by saying what?

depend on the regulatory scheme, what the --

JUSTICE BREYER: So now what you're saying is, 

in a Commerce Clause case, what we're supposed to do is to 

start to look at the federal scheme and the state scheme 

and see, comparing the federal scheme and the state 

scheme, whether, given the state scheme, the federal 

scheme is really necessary to include this. That's a 

task, and I'm trying to make it as complicated as I can in 

my question.

 [Laughter.] 

JUSTICE BREYER: But I see it very well. Here 

is what they say. They say that, "By the way, a hundred-

thousand people using medical marijuana in California will 

lead to lower marijuana prices in the nation. Bad. And, 

second, when we see medical marijuana in California, we 

won't know what it is. Everybody'll say, 'Mine is 

medical.' Certificates will circulate on the black 

market. We face a mess. For both those reasons, it does 

have an impact," they say. Now, what's your response?

 MR. BARNETT: Well, you've raised at least two 

different practical issues. One is the fact -- the number 

of people who are in the class, and the second is the 

ability to identify whether they properly belong in the 

class.

about a very small number of people. They say a hundred-

thousand. They get their figures from the National 

Organization from Reform of Marijuana Laws. Our figures 

in our brief come from the government. The figures show 

it's a very small fraction of persons that would be 

involved. And their argument is basically -- and the 

logic of your hypothetical is premised on -- the more 

people that go into the illicit market, the better for 

federal drug policy, because that will drive the price up. 

You have to -- what we're take -- we're doing is, we're 

taking people out of the illicit drug market, which then, 

under your hypothetical, would lead to a reduction -- and 

Justice Kennedy's suggestion -- would lead to a reduction 

in the price of the illegal market, which, the opposite 

would be, they're -- it's good for federal policy to have 

more people in the illicit drug market, because that's 

going to drive the price up.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, we don't want more 

people --

MR. BARNETT: Of course not.

JUSTICE BREYER: And you say all that stuff is 

not for Congress; that's for us.

 MR. BARNETT: Well, within this exception -- the 

threshold issue -- I do want to make sure that I focus on 

this -- the threshold issue, which is the issue that has 

occupied most of our time so far, is whether the activity 

here is economic or non-economic. The government claims 

it's economic, we claim it's non-economic.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what it is, is, it's non-

economic, and it affects the economic.

 MR. BARNETT: Right. So the threshold issue 

that is -- that -- upon which Lopez and Morrison terms --

turns is whether it's economic or non-economic.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I should have thought

that regular household chores of -- say, performed in an 

earlier time mostly by women, was classically economic --

washing dishes, making bread. And now you say growing 

marijuana isn't?

 MR. BARNETT: If you accept the government's 

definition of economic, then every -- then washing dishes, 

today, would be economic, and that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but even --

MR. BARNETT: -- would be within the -- within 

the power of Congress to reach.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But even if we accept your 

definition of economic, I don't see that it is a basis 

upon which we ought to make a category decision. You say 

it's non-economic because one of these people is a -- is a 

self-grower, another one is getting it from a friend for 

nothing. But I don't see what reason that you have given, 

or any reason that you haven't given, for us to believe 

that, out of -- now I'm going to assume, for the sake of 

argument, a hundred-thousand potential users -- everybody 

is going to get it from a friend or from plants in the 

backyard. Seems to me the sensible assumption is, they're 

going to get it on the street. And once they get it, 

under California law, it's not a crime for them to have it 

and use it. But they're going to get it in the street. 

Why isn't that the sensible assumption?

 MR. BARNETT: Well, they have an -- they have a 

very strong incentive not to get it on the street, because 

getting it on the street is going to subject them to 

criminal prosecution, under both California and federal 

law, as well as the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but the -- it's also the 

case that approximately 10 percent of the American 

population is doing that every day, if I accept the 

figures in the government's brief, and they're not getting 

prosecuted.

 MR. BARNETT: But we're talking -- in that case, 

we're talking about people who are using it for sport, for 

recreation. We are talking about a class of people here 

who are sick people, who don't necessarily want to violate 

the law.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And if I am a sick person, I'm 

going to say, "Look, if they're not prosecuting every kid 

who buys, what, a nickel bag or whatever you call a small 

quantity today, they're not going to prosecute me, 

either." I mean, there's not going to be any incentive, 

it seems to me, to avoid the street market. 

MR. BARNETT: The government, in their brief, 

asserts that the -- that the possession statute that 

currently exists provides a deterrent effect, which is why 

they -- which is their explanation for why they failed to

enforce the possession statute that they say is so 

essential to the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If one --

MR. BARNETT: -- regulatory scheme.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- if one takes your view, 

that this is non-economic activity, so it's outside 

Congress' commerce power, then explain to me why, if you 

have someone similarly situated in a neighboring state, 

somebody whose doctor says, "This person needs marijuana 

to live," but that state doesn't have a Compassionate-Use 

Act -- it's just as isolated -- no purchase, no sale, 

grown at home, good friend grows it -- and yet you say 

Congress could regulate that, if I understand your brief 

properly.

 MR. BARNETT: Yes, Your -- yes, Your Honor, 

because there's the -- that's the second step of the 

analysis. The first step of the analysis is the 

economic/non-economic. If you don't -- if the Court stops 

there, then they could also apply in these other states. 

But then if the Court adopts --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you -- if you buy that 

-- so your first answer is, yes, on your first argument, 

it would be equally impermissible for the feds to regulate 

medical use anywhere.

 MR. BARNETT: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: All right. Now you're going 

to have some limiting --

MR. BARNETT: But a limiting principle is the 

one that I -- was identified by the Court in Lopez in 

which the government is asserting that if it's an 

essential part of a broader regulation of economic 

activity to reach this activity, then it may be reached. 

And the difference between states in which there is a 

state law enforcement that's confining the class, and that 

there is a discrimination between legal and non-legal use, 

is completely different from a practical enforcement 

standpoint than a state in which there is no 

differentiation. Just think of the existence, for 

example, of identification cards, which the State of 

California is going to be issuing, like driver's license 

cards.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yeah, but it doesn't right 

now, and that doesn't make the scheme less valid, in your 

view.

 MR. BARNETT: Well, because -- but this is the 

sort of regulation -- the sort of effectiveness of the 

regulation that will be at issue and which is, in fact --

I believe the Court should be in the position of trusting 

the State of California to be able to administer its 

regime. There is no regime in other states to trust, and,

therefore, the argument that it is necessary to reach that 

activity, and a lot of other activity in states in which 

the states are not attempting to pursue the health of 

their citizens -- the goal of preserving the health of 

their citizens this way, that would fall under the 

exception which this Court suggested in Lopez --

JUSTICE BREYER: This is a new framework, I 

take it, and it's very interesting. And one of the things 

that interests me -- I guess, on your framework, Lopez 

should have come out my way.

 [Laughter.] 

MR. BARNETT: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's essential to regulate 

guns in schools as part of a national gun-control regulatory 

scheme.

 MR. BARNETT: Justice Breyer, that's the reason 

why that exception has to be narrowly treated, so it 

doesn't reach your result.

 [Laughter.] 

MR. BARNETT: If that exception were treated as 

broadly as you suggested that it should be in your dissent 

in Morrison, then the game is up, the exception will 

swallow the rule, and Lopez and Morrison will be limited 

to their facts.

to reach all that here, for the reason that the connection 

here, which is an enforcement-related connection and a 

market-related connection, is actually, I have to confess, 

a little more obvious and a little more close than what I 

had to -- what I had to say in Lopez to -- was the 

connection between guns, education, communities, and 

business. So I would have thought, given the -- and I 

believe that, you know -- but, I mean -- but that was far 

further than this, which is just direct.

 MR. BARNETT: But this case is completely unlike 

those cases. This case is completely isolated. In Lopez, 

that gun probably did come through interstate commerce, 

not that I believe it should have made any difference, but 

it probably did. Here, we're talking about substances 

that don't. So there's just no literal connection between 

this class of activities and this interstate market.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, we didn't decide that, in 

Lopez, on the basis of whether the gun had come in 

interstate commerce. If the statute in question had 

applied only to guns that had been transported in 

interstate commerce, the case might have come out 

differently.

 MR. BARNETT: I -- no doubt, Your -- I -- and I 

wasn't suggesting otherwise, Justice Scalia. I'm just 

suggesting that, here, we have -- exactly, that if there

had been that interstate connection in Lopez, the case 

might have come out different. There is no interstate 

connection whatsoever in this class of cases. None. The 

only way to make it an interstate connection is through 

some sort of hypothetical economic substitution effect in 

which somebody who's doing something over here is going to 

have an affect on somebody else who's doing something over 

there. There is no connection.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Sounds like Wickard to me.

 MR. BARNETT: Well, Wickard, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I always used to laugh at 

Wickard, but that's -- that's what Wickard said.

 MR. BARNETT: Wickard --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Had he not eaten the wheat, it 

would have been in interstate commerce.

 MR. BARNETT: Had that case been about eating 

wheat, that case would never have arisen.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's what it was about, 

as far as the Court's analysis was concerned. To be sure, 

there were a lot of -- there was a lot more use of the 

wheat on his farm, other than just human consumption, but 

it seems to me the analysis of the case said, "You take it 

-- you take it out of the stream of commerce by growing it 

yourself, you make it unnecessary for your -- to buy it in 

interstate commerce."

 MR. BARNETT: It's -- the entire analysis -- the 

entire proof that the court relied upon in Wickard was 

proof of the economic impact of home-consumed wheat on the 

farms. And by "home-consumed," it did not mean eating at 

the family -- at the family table; it meant feeding to 

your livestock and then putting it -- your livestock --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Strange phrase, to mean 

"feeding to livestock"?

 MR. BARNETT: But the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: "Home-consumed" is feed it to 

your pig?

 MR. BARNETT: But, yes, that's exactly what --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think so.

 MR. BARNETT: -- that's exactly what that 

general term -- how that general term was used in this 

case.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But what the Court said, I take 

it -- and I have quoted a lot of the language there -- it 

says that the wheat farmer's consumption of home-grown 

wheat, not the part that went in -- quote, "though it may 

not be regarded as commerce" --

MR. BARNETT: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- end quote, still can be 

regulated, quote, "whatever its nature," so long as, 

quote, "it exerts a substantial economic effect on

interstate commerce." Now, that's the language, and I 

take it that Justice Scalia is exactly right, I thought, 

from that language, it's about the analysis, home-grown 

wheat, which is not economic, having an effect on 

something that is.

 MR. BARNETT: With all respect --

JUSTICE BREYER: Which is not commerce. Sorry, 

not commerce.

 MR. BARNETT: With all respect, what -- that's 

-- I was about to make that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the Commerce Clause 

speaks in terms of commerce.

 MR. BARNETT: Right. Right. What the Court was 

using here was the narrower -- the traditional definition 

of "commerce" that Justice Thomas has been urging this 

Court to adopt. And they were saying that, "We are not 

going to limit ourselves to that narrow definition of 

'commerce.'" It would include, for example, agriculture 

and production. That's all going to be reachable, even 

though it's not commerce, in the traditional sense. But 

what we would call it today, and I believe what the Court 

correctly called it, in Lopez, was "economic activity." 

Production is economic activity. Manufacturing is 

economic activity. But -- it's not commerce, but it's 

economic activity that can be reached. And that is the

activity -- that's not only the activity that Farmer 

Filburn was engaged in; that was the activity that the 

statute was aimed at. The statute --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, why is this not economic 

activity, if you use the term in that broad sense? This 

marijuana that is grown, just like the wheat that was 

grown, in Wickard, since it's grown on the farm, doesn't 

have to be bought elsewhere, and that makes it an economic 

activity.

 MR. BARNETT: What made it an economic activity 

in Wickard was the fact that it was part of commercial 

enterprise, that it was being used on the farm -- not in 

interstate commerce, but part of the commercial enterprise 

of the farm.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Again, I don't think that's --

that faithfully represents what the opinion said. I think 

the opinion covered -- including the amount that he 

consumed himself, and his family consumed.

 MR. BARNETT: The -- look, I -- for whatever 

it's worth, it's worth remembering that the statute 

exempted small commercial farms. People who had backyard 

gardens weren't even included within the regulatory 

regime. The regulatory regime was about regulating or 

stopping or restricting the supply of wheat that got into 

the market, or that could have --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think it was a point of 

the Court's analysis at all.

 MR. BARNETT: This --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Could I -- could I --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Could I ask this question. 

What is your view with respect to the impact of the 

activities concerned in this case on the interstate market 

for marijuana? Is it your view that it will have no 

impact, that it will increase the interstate demand, or 

decrease the interstate demand? So there are three 

alternatives. Which is the one we should follow?

 MR. BARNETT: Can I pick "trivial impact"?

 [Laughter.] 

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but if it -- "trivial 

impact," is it a trivial impact that enhances the price of 

marijuana or decreases the price of marijuana, in your 

view?

 MR. BARNETT: The only effect it could have on 

the price would be a slight trivial reduction, if it has 

any effect at all, because it's going to withdraw users 

from the illicit drug market. And to the extent that they 

are now in the illicit drug market -- and we don't know 

whether they are or not --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, that would reduce demand 

and increase price, it seems to me. It's the other way 

around.

 MR. BARNETT: Well, it would reduce demand and 

reduce prices, I think. But --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If you reduce demand, you 

reduce prices? Are you sure?

 MR. BARNETT: Yes.

 [Laughter.] 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Oh, you're right. You're 

right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Your whole argument for 

triviality, though, goes -- your whole argument for 

triviality, though, goes back to your disagreement with 

the government about how many people are involved, because 

I take it you accept the assumption that the more people 

who are involved -- if there are millions and millions, it 

is unlikely that this licensed activity is going to be 

without an effect on the market. So the whole argument

boils down to how many people are going to be involved. 

You don't accept the government's 100,000-dollar figure. 

Let me ask you a question that would -- that would get to, 

maybe, a different number, and that is, do you know how 

many people there are in California who are undergoing 

chemotherapy at any given time?

 MR. BARNETT: I do not know the answer to that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that number going to be 

indicative of the demand for marijuana?

 MR. BARNETT: It could be, Your Honor, but that 

also illustrates --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But if you -- if you accept 

that, then there's nothing implausible about the 

government's hundred-thousand number, is there?

 MR. BARNETT: But whatever -- I don't know, 

because I don't know the number of people using 

chemotherapy. But whatever the number --

JUSTICE SOUTER: How many people are there in 

California? What's the population?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Thirty-four million.

 MR. BARNETT: Thank you, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Lots -- lots --

[Laughter.] 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- lots and lots. They -- a

does not seem like an implausible number. And, in fact, 

if that number is a plausible one today, its plausibility 

reflects, among other things, the fact that there is a 

controversy as to whether California's law, in fact, is 

enforceable, or not. And the reason -- there is reason to 

assume that -- if we ruled your way, that that number 

would go up.

 So, if you accept that line of argument, then 

your argument, that the effect, whatever it may be, is 

going to be trivial, seems to me unsupportable. Am I 

missing something?

 MR. BARNETT: Well, two things. First of all, 

whatever number it is, it's going to be confined to people 

who are sick, who are sick enough to use this. That is 

not an infinitely expandable number, the way, for example, 

recreational activity is, where lots of people could just 

decide to do it. We're talking about people who qualify, 

on a physician's recommendation, for this particular 

activity. That will limit the number.

 But the amount of the people -- the effect on 

commerce only matters if the Wickard v. Filburn 

aggregation principle applies to the class of activities 

in this case, and it does not apply to the class of 

activities in this case if they are non-economic, as we 

assert that they are.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well -- but that is circular 

reasoning, because the whole -- your whole argument that 

it's non-economic is based on the claim that there are --

the numbers are so few -- the number of people involved, 

from what you could generalize, are so few that it would 

not be reasonable to infer an effect on the market. If 

there would be a large market effect, it makes no more 

sense to call this non-economic than Filburn's use, non-

economic.

 MR. BARNETT: Lopez and Morrison stand for the 

proposition that activities that simply have an effect on 

the market are not necessary -- that does not make them 

economic. This Court rejected that proposition, that just 

because an activity has an effect -- an economic effect 

makes the activity, itself, economic. It adopted a 

principle that's less than --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Remote, remote, remote economic 

effect.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It was inference upon inference 

upon inference. That's not what we're talking about here.

 MR. BARNETT: But just -- just have it -- just 

-- whether an activity is economic, you have to look to 

the activity, itself, and an economic activity is one 

that's associated with sale, exchange, barter, the 

production of things for sale and exchange, barter. This

whole Court's jurisprudence since The New Deal has been 

premised on the ability to tell the difference between 

economic activity, on the one hand, and personal liberty, 

on the other.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But your whole jurisprudence 

in this case is premised on the assumption that we have got 

to identify the entire range of potential effect based on 

the particular character of two individuals in their -- in 

their supply of marijuana. And the whole point of this 

argument is that that does not seem to be a realistic 

premise on which to base constitutional law.

 MR. BARNETT: The premise of our -- the premise 

of our economic claim is the nature of the activity 

involved, not necessarily its effect, but the kind of 

activity it is. The idea -- for example, you --

prostitution is an economic activity. Marital relations 

is not an economic activity. We could be talking about 

virtually the same act. And there is a market overhang 

for -- from private sexual relations to prostitution, but 

we don't say that because there is a market for 

prostitution, that, therefore, everything that is not in 

that market is economic. We look at the activities, and 

we --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'd like to ask you one 

question about the activity --

 MR. BARNETT: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- which was brought up before, 

and I just -- I've never understood this. I'm not an 

expert. I don't honestly know, if I really think about 

it, despite all the papers and so forth, whether it's true 

that medical marijuana is helpful to people in ways that 

pills are not. I really don't know.

 So I would have thought that the people, like 

your clients, who have a strong view about it, would go to 

the FDA, and they would say to the FDA, "FDA, take this 

off the list. You must take it off the list if it has an 

accepted medical use and it isn't lacking in safety."

 The FDA will say yes or it will say no. If it 

says yes, they win. If they say no, they can come right 

into court and say, "That's an abuse of discretion."

 The Court says yes or no. If it says yes, they 

win. If it says no, it must be because it wasn't an abuse 

of discretion, in which case, I, as a judge, and probably 

as a person, would think it isn't true that marijuana has 

some kind of special use.

 So that would seem to me to be the obvious way 

to get what they want. That seems to me to be relevant to 

the correct characterization. And while the FDA can make 

mistakes, I guess medicine by regulation is better than 

medicine by referendum.

 MR. BARNETT: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: So that's -- I just want to 

know why.

 MR. BARNETT: Well, Your Honor, first of all, 

that whole process wouldn't dictate what the power of 

Congress is to reach this activity --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's all true, but as long as 

that hasn't been done, don't I have to take this case on 

the assumption that there is no such thing as medical 

marijuana that's special and necessary?

 MR. BARNETT: I would --

JUSTICE BREYER: If has been done, maybe I 

shouldn't make it.

 MR. BARNETT: -- I would simply ask Your Honor 

to read the amicus brief by Rick Doblin, in which it 

describes the government's obstruction of scientific 

research that would establish the safety and efficacy of 

cannabis by denying supplies of cannabis -- of medical --

of cannabis for medical experimentation.

 And then I'd ask Your Honor to read the 

Institute for Medicine's report, that both the government 

and I -- and we have relied upon in our briefs. There has 

been no impeachment of this report by the National Academy 

of Sciences on the medical effect. And what they say is 

that the -- that what information we have is that cannabis

does have a substantial medical effect. Smoked cannabis 

does carry with it harms associated with it, as the -- as 

General Clement correctly pointed out. It does carry with 

it these ancillary harms. But when people are sick and 

people are suffering and people are dying, they may be 

willing to run the risk of these long-term harms in order 

to get the immediate relief, the life-saving relief that 

cannabis has demonstrably been able to provide. I'd just 

ask Your Honor to look at that, which is in the record.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are prescriptions, under 

California law, limited only to those people with life-

threatening illnesses?

 MR. BARNETT: They are limited to a list of 

illnesses that are in the statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Some of the illnesses --

MR. BARNETT: Some of which are life-threatening 

and some of which are not, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In one -- in one plaintiff's 

case, I think, there isn't a life-threatening --

MR. BARNETT: That's correct, Your Honor. She 

has -- she has severe back spasms and pain that cannot be 

controlled by conventional medicines. She's a law-abiding 

citizen. This goes back to the issue of what the --

incentives there are that are created by this. This is a 

law-abiding woman, who has never been interested in the

illicit-drugs market.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just ask you one 

procedural question?

 MR. BARNETT: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And this is -- this is a suit 

for an injunction. And it -- basically an injunction 

against a criminal prosecution.

 MR. BARNETT: And seizure --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And --

MR. BARNETT: -- of these plants.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and there's an old saying, 

in equity, that courts don't enjoin criminal prosecutions. 

So how is your injunction suit appropriate, given that old 

saying meant that you have to make your defense in the 

criminal proceeding and not enjoin this operation?

 MR. BARNETT: Well, it is -- it is an -- we're 

seeking an injunction to prevent the enforcement of the 

statute against these two persons, which includes 

forfeiture, which has already happened in this case. 

We've already had Diane Monson's plants seized by the Drug 

Enforcement Authority. That is not something that we --

that we -- that has anything to do with criminal 

prosecution, and yet that puts at risk her supply of 

medicine, the supply of medicine she needs to get by, to 

relieve her suffering.

 General Clement, you have four minutes.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and 

may it please the Court:

 As I understand Respondents' position, it's 

effectively that their clients, and clients like them, in 

their use of medical marijuana, is somehow so hermetically 

sealed from the rest of the market on marijuana that it 

has no effect on that market on marijuana and no effect on 

the government's overall regulatory regime. And I 

understand that to be true largely because of state law.

 And one of the many problems with that mode of 

analysis is that the state law is not designed only to 

carve out those transactions that have no effect on 

interstate commerce or no effect on the federal regulatory 

regime. Proposition 215 was not passed as an exercise in 

cooperative federalism; it was passed as an effort to make 

medical marijuana lawful to possess, whether you bought it 

in interstate commerce, whether you bought it with the 

marijuana having traveled in interstate commerce, whether 

you bought it, whether you grew it yourself. There's a 

fundamental mismatch with their theory that really, I

think, undermines their theory.

 Now, there's the question now about what kind of 

impact this would have on the federal enforcement scheme. 

Now, we, in our reply brief, try to use the numbers from 

one of Respondents' own amici, and we suggest that there's 

a hundred-thousand people that might be lawful medical 

users, if their position prevails. Now, obviously, this 

is all an effort in, sort of, counter-factual speculation, 

so the numbers may be a bit off. But they suggest that 

our own government numbers are somehow better, and they 

cite them on page 18 of the red brief. But the only 

numbers on the red brief for California suggest that, in 

the four counties for which there are data, there was --

.5 percent of the people use marijuana. Now, if you 

extend that out statewide to the 34 million people in 

California, that gives you 170,000 people. So their 

numbers -- using the government numbers actually give you 

more potentially affected people.

 I think in trying to figure out how many people 

would be affected, it's worth considering what medical 

conditions are covered. And this responds to Justice 

Kennedy's last question, Is this just limited to AIDS or 

people with terminal cancer? And it's not. And if you 

want to look at what is covered as a serious medical 

condition under the statute, you can turn to page 7(a) of

the red brief, in the appendix to the red brief, and it 

suggests that a serious medical condition -- there's a 

catchall at the end that includes subsection 12 -- "Any 

other chronic or persistent medical system that, if not 

alleviated, may cause serious harm to the patient's safety 

or physical or mental health." Now, I think that is an 

exceedingly broad definition of a serious medical 

condition for which somebody could be -- get a 

recommendation for marijuana for medical uses.

 Another point worth considering, in considering 

the impact on the federal regulatory regime or the 

effectiveness of California in preventing any diversion, 

is to take a look at two cases we cite in our reply brief. 

One is the People against Wright. There's somebody who's 

arrested with 19 ounces, over a pound, of marijuana. 

They're packaged such that he has one small bag in his 

pocket, six other small bags wrapped with a scale in his 

backpack, two other larger bags in that backpack, and then 

a pound wrapped in a shirt in the back of his truck. And 

yet the Appellate Court in California said that he was 

entitled to go to the jury with the theory that that was 

for medical use. The fact that he had a scale, and the 

fact that it was packaged the way it was, could be 

explained to the jury because he had just boughten it, and 

that he used the scale to make sure he wasn't ripped-off.

I think that shows that it's going to be very hard to 

enforce the regulatory regime. 

The other case in the reply brief worth 

mentioning is the Santa Cruz case, because that's a case 

where a Federal District Court, after Raich came out, said 

that it could not enforce the DA and the Controlled 

Substances Act against a 250-person cooperative. And that 

just shows that this is not something that will be limited 

to one or two users at a time, but will have a substantial 

impact on the government's ability to enforce the 

Controlled Substances Act.

 Thank you.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you, General Clement.

 The case is submitted.

 [Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
