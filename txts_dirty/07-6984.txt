 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 07-6984, Jimenez v. Quarterman.

 Mr. Goldstein.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 When the Texas courts in this case 

reinstated the Petitioner's direct appeal, the Texas 

Court of Appeals decided that appeal like it would 

decide any other case on direct review. We filed a 

petition for discretionary review in the Texas Court of 

Criminal Appeals, which was denied, and it was 

considered like any other appeal would be.

 The question presented by this case is 

whether the final judgment that indisputably results 

from those rulings triggers the one-year statute of 

limitations to file a Federal habeas corpus application. 

The statute that governs that question is reproduced in 

the blue brief at page 1.

 Section 2244(d)(1)(A) prescribes "a 1-year 

period of limitation that shall apply to an application 

for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody

pursuant to the judgment of the State court. The 

limitation period shall run from the latest of -- and it 

identifies four dates, the first of which is "the date 

on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of 

direct review or the expiration of time for seeking such 

review."

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And you don't think you 

need to go beyond (A) to resolve the case?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's right, Justice 

Kennedy. Subsection (A) resolves this case by its plain 

terms.

 Now, the Fifth Circuit decided this case --

this issue, I'm sorry -- in 2004 in a case called 

Salinas, and it thought that the factual scenario of the 

case was more logically covered by subsection (d)(2) of 

the statute, which is on page 2 of the blue brief. And 

that provision is the tolling provision, and it says: 

"The time during which a properly filed application for 

State post-conviction or other collateral review with 

respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending 

shall not be counted toward any period of limitation 

under the subsection."

 And the Fifth Circuit's view in that Salinas 

case was that the better way of looking at this is that 

when the State post-conviction court awarded relief of

further direct review, all of that should be regarded as 

part of the post-conviction process. But four years 

after -- three years after the Fifth Circuit decided 

Salinas, this Court decided Lawrence v. Florida, and 

Lawrence disposes of the Fifth Circuit's logic in 

Salinas, because Lawrence says that when the 

post-conviction court, here the Texas Court of Criminal 

Appeals, issues its mandate the application for 

post-conviction review is no longer pending. And so 

there isn't any reason to believe that Congress thought 

this factual scenario was covered by the tolling 

provisions of (d)(2).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, does your 

position depend upon the proposition that we are not 

free to consider sort of a second direct appeal as part 

of the collateral review process?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It doesn't depend on it, 

Mr. Chief Justice. We don't have to reach that question 

because, as I have said in answer to Justice Kennedy's 

question, you can resolve this under (d)(1). But I was 

just trying to explain why the Fifth Circuit, which 

struggled with how to handle this scenario, was wrong in 

thinking it was governed by the tolling provision.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess it 

doesn't -- or does it really make a difference? I mean,

if you view the direct appeal that is the result of the 

collateral review process as part of the collateral 

review process, that time is tolled. And if you take 

your view and regard it as not final to trigger the 

process until you have another final decision, it kind 

of leads to the same result, doesn't it?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: In many cases, but not all, 

including this one. The difference is that if you 

regard this as governed by tolling, that the second --

what we will call for purposes of the argument, just so 

we know, the second appeal, so the appeal that's granted 

by the post-conviction report, if you regard the proper 

way of reading 2244 to be you have to regard that as 

being tolled and the start date is the dismissal of the 

original appeal, if the State Petitioner seeks 

post-conviction review more than one year after the 

dismissal of the first appeal, his Federal time is done. 

So, this --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But does that really 

matter? I mean, the whole purpose of the Federal 

statute of limitations is to make sure these things get 

done within one year. And if he waits a year before 

filing, then he's out of time under AEDPA.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It is -- it is the case that 

Congress wanted it done within one year. The question

presented by this case is one year of what?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: So, there are four different 

possible start dates. We know that the Fifth Circuit 

was wrong in the Salinas case when it said that Congress 

envisioned only a linear time period stopped only by 

tolling that would run from the first disposition of the 

case, because 2244(d)(1)(B), (C), and (D) are all 

provisions under which the time can expire and then be 

restarted.

 So, what we think Congress wanted when it 

was picking start dates and the start date in (d)(1)(A), 

the one that usually applies, is it wanted the State 

courts on direct review to be done with the case, finish 

it off. Then the State petitioner will have one year to 

start the State post-conviction process and when that's 

done go on to Federal court.

 The reason we think Congress wanted to 

include the second appeal, the conclusion of the second 

appeal, as the trigger is that what's going on in the 

Federal district court is you are trying to decide if 

the State court's disposition of the case is contrary to 

clearly established law as established by this Court. 

And you won't know that, you won't even know what the 

Federal district court is supposed to be reviewing,

until the conclusion of the second appeal.

 If I could just illustrate that, in the 

joint appendix at page 43, is the State court opinion in 

this case. The Texas Court of Appeals decided this case 

and resolved his, the Petitioner's, Federal 

constitutional claims. And it only did that in the 

second appeal. And that's what Congress was concerned 

with the Federal district court's reviewing. It's --

when this opinion is issued and then the Texas Court of 

Criminal Appeals, which is their highest court in 

criminal cases, denies review, then it's logical for the 

time period to start.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In the background of this 

case, Mr. Goldstein, is that in fact he didn't know the 

first time that his appeal had been dismissed. He 

didn't know that his lawyer had filed an Anders brief. 

But when he found that out, he waited some four and a 

half years.

 So why isn't the -- Texas right 

when it says look at (B) and (D), they would have fit 

his case? He could have used those to get time starting 

from the date that he found out. It wouldn't give him 

four and a half years. But why -- you say we, all we 

have to consider is (A); you said that in answer to 

Justice Kennedy. But why shouldn't we say that either

(B) or (D) fits his case?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay, can I answer that 

question, Justice Ginsburg, in two parts?

 First most directly, I want to explain our 

position with respect to (B) and (D) and then I want to 

discuss the broad thematic concern that's raised by our 

case. Here's the troubling fact by our case, and that 

is the prospect that multiple State defendants will take 

more than a year, and I would like to deal with that 

thematic point and explain why I don't think that's a 

concern.

 But to start directly with your point, (B) 

and (D), assuming that they apply for a moment, will 

only accomplish the following -- and then I want to 

explain why I don't think they would apply. But even if 

they apply, what they would do is defer the start date 

of the one year. So on the facts in this case, one year 

after -- 11 months or so after the Texas Court of 

Appeals erroneously dismissed the Petitioner's first 

direct appeal without giving him the opportunity to file 

a pro se brief, he found out.

 On the State's view, the one-year Federal 

habeas corpus time would be deferred for 11 months, and 

that is a very generous defendant-favoring position for 

Texas to take in this Court. If it then starts, it

doesn't -- that reading does not accomplish what 

Congress wanted in 2244, because the State prisoner, 

though the time will have been deferred for a year, will 

still have to file for Federal habeas corpus within a 

year, notwithstanding the fact that he will get a second 

direct appeal.

 So he will be proceeding in both courts. 

His start date will have been deferred for 11 months, 

but he nonetheless one year later must appear in a 

Federal district court in Texas, even though on 

post-conviction review in the State courts he is sent 

back to direct review.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, but is that 

right? I mean unless you count, as I gather your 

friends on the other side would do, the period of direct 

appeal as part of the collateral review process?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That's correct. And that's 

the argument about Lawrence. That argument is not 

sustainable in light of Lawrence. Just to say that you 

have their argument exactly right, Mr. Chief Justice, 

the State's position is, as the Fifth Circuit held in 

the Salinas case, that when you get relief on 

post-conviction review and you are sent back to the 

State system, (d)(2) continues to apply, but that is not 

correct. The tolling stops, and that is because, as

Lawrence held, the application which is his 

post-conviction application in the State court, saying 

that I was deprived of my right to appeal, is no longer 

pending. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has issued 

its mandate. So that's why this anomaly arises under 

the application of (B) or (D) that we don't think 

Congress could have intended.

 Now, Justice Ginsburg, there is a second 

part to my answer, and that is the specific point about 

whether (B) and (D) do by their terms apply; and here we 

are in the anomalous position that if, again, Texas is 

arguing very defendant-favoring readings of (B) and (D) 

and I, representing the habeas Petitioner, am in the 

unusual role of questioning whether these later start 

dates apply.

 But here our -- the lower courts I think it 

is clear would say that (B) and (D) don't apply. To 

take you to the textual -- the text of the statute, 

again, (B) appears at the bottom of page 1 of the blue 

brief; and that has a start date of the date on which 

the impediment for filing an application created by 

State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of 

the United States is removed, if the applicant was 

prevented from filing by such State action. And the 

lower courts, as we explained in our brief, pretty

uniformly conclude that the failure to give a defendant 

notice that his appeal has been dismissed is not an 

impediment created by State action to him filing a 

Federal habeas corpus application. And so their attempt 

to grapple with our unusual facts has -- would 

substantially broaden the application of subsection (B).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the State 

convicting, penalizing the defendant despite the fact 

that his constitutional right to competent counsel 

was -- he lost that right because of the failure of 

notification?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's just -- it's not 

regarded as an impediment. The -- the courts -- the 

lower courts take quite literally that there has to be 

an impediment. The lower court decisions grappling with 

what an impediment is deal with the situation where a 

prison warden, for example, does not allow you access to 

the prison mails or somehow access to the legal 

resources you in order to be able to file it. He won't 

deliver the habeas corpus application.

 (D) is even easier, I think, and that is the 

deadline starts from the date on which the factual 

predicate of the claim or claims presented could have 

been discovered through the exercise of due diligence. 

And the reason the State is not right about that

provision and does not even really seriously argue it is 

that the claims referenced in (D) are the claims that 

are presented in the Federal habeas corpus application. 

Here that's the claim that he had ineffective assistance 

of trial counsel and that the judge was biased against 

him. They are not the claim that he received -- that he 

was denied the right to an appeal. And so it just --

there is no textual basis to say that the later start 

date would apply under (D).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is this just a 

dispute about the label? Because Texas chooses to call 

the proceeding that you get if you are successful on 

collateral review a second direct appeal, you would 

count finality one way; if they just switch the label 

and say that is the collateral review appeal process, 

then you would agree with them?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, sir. We think that you 

have to look at substance. As -- the language that we 

use in a footnote in our reply brief addressing this is 

whether the proceeding has the hallmarks of direct 

review. There are two States that do have a procedure, 

South Carolina and Delaware, in which you can raise your 

claim on post-conviction review that you were deprived 

of your right to a direct appeal. And the 

post-conviction court has the power to decide that on

post-conviction review.

 We haven't found a case in which they actual 

exercised the power, but it appears that 48 of the 50 

States deal with this problem the way Texas does, and 

that is the relief that you get is that you are sent 

back into the direct review system. And then we think 

it's covered quite plainly by the text of (d)(1). When 

that direct review is over, direct review concludes by 

its plain terms.

 Now, Justice Ginsburg, I had said that I 

wanted to come back and deal with the thematic problem 

that might concern the Court about our case, and that is 

the prospect that we will have defendants filing State 

post-conviction applications more than a year late, 

which could trouble the Court. As the Chief Justice 

indicated, Congress had a concern with moving this 

process along.

 In addition just to the plain text of the 

statute which we think is controlling, there are I think 

three points. The first is there are State limitations 

principles that get these State prisoners to file their 

applications in a timely way. Now, in the great 

majority of States that's set by a number of years. In 

some States like Texas it's applied by the principle of 

laches. And the important point and the reason we are

here today is that Texas, for whatever reason -- and the 

time limitations are intended to protect Texas here --

decided not to assert that his State post-conviction 

application was untimely. It didn't object to the 

granting of relief to the Petitioner at all.

 The second reason, in addition to the 

State's own limitations period, is that the AEDPA 

one-year limitations period has real force. In the 

great majority of cases in which a State defendant is 

going to allege that he was deprived of his right to an 

appeal and raise that claim on State post-conviction 

review, he's going to lose that claim. The -- the 

States don't give this stuff out like candy, and the 

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is not, you know, 

constantly reinstating defendant's appeals. And 

defendants know that.

 And unless you prevail on this claim, you 

are stuck with the one-year AEDPA time that runs from 

the dismissal of your first appeal. And so you have 

every incentive in the world to get into State court 

quickly.

 And the third is just the general notion 

that defendants in non-capital cases don't have a real 

incentive to just delay before instituting a State 

post-conviction review. And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose it is denied by --

by the State court. And suppose it's denied by the 

State court more -- more than a year after the 

conclusion of the original proceeding. What -- what is 

the consequence then?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I -- can I just ask one 

point of clarification? If he instituted it more than a 

year after the dismissal of the first proceeding, he is 

out of time, because there is only one final judgment, 

and that is the original dismissal.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Suppose he institutes it, 

however, within the year.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay. If he instituted 

it -- can I just say six months? So six months' after 

the first dismissal, the Petitioner appears in the Texas 

post-conviction court. At that point (d)(2) starts to 

apply, because he has a properly filed application for 

State post-conviction relief. The State court -- the 

State post-conviction court takes three months to 

dispose of it, a year to dispose of it; it doesn't 

matter. When the State post-conviction court is done 

and in your hypothetical denies him relief, he has six 

months left to go to federal district court. (d)(2) 

operates as it should. While the case is sitting in the 

State post-conviction court --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And he can't go to Federal 

court until that is resolved?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is correct, because he 

has not exhausted his claim. When the claim is that you 

were denied your right to a direct appeal, the only 

place that you can raise that claim is State 

post-conviction review. Federal habeas corpus requires 

you to exhaust your available State remedies. Your 

available State remedy for that is State post-conviction 

review. He may not appear in Federal district court. 

The district court I think would abuse its discretion in 

staying a plainly unexhausted claim. That wouldn't be 

good cause, as this Court has said, for it.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you do prevail, it is 

rather dramatic, because your client was stunningly 

negligent. He does nothing for four and-a-half years, 

then strolls over to the State court.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice Kennedy, the 

State, as I said, did not raise this argument in the 

place where we think it's appropriate, and that no 

record was built on laches. It does -- it does have 

that feel.

 I do think that the Court's opinion could 

make clear that this anomaly arises from the fact that, 

despite the fact that the Texas courts have made clear

that there are laches principles and limitations --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I ask if laches is 

something that the Texas court could bring up on its 

own, or is it for the State to raise or not as it 

chooses?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: It is for the State to 

raise, and we cite our Texas authority for that in our 

reply brief, Justice Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the State statute that 

allows the early conviction to be set aside and the 

appeal reinstated -- do we have that statute?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Kennedy, that is 

section 11 -- article 11.07.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought I had it. Do we 

have it in --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: I do not believe you do. 

And the reason is that article 11.07 is just the general 

Texas post-conviction regime. The procedure that is 

used for reinstating direct appeals is developed through 

caselaw, not by statute.

 Justice Scalia, there was a final point that 

I was about to make when I said, look, defendants in 

non-capital cases have every incentive, if they want to 

get relief, to move their cases along. The Court may be 

concerned about capital cases where there is the

opposite concern, that defendants will try and keep 

their cases alive, if you will. And Texas recognizes 

this point and has a deadline by statute that is quite 

short for instituting post-conviction relief in capital 

cases.

 They simply recognize that laches is the way 

to handle the prospect of delay in non-capital cases. 

We don't think there is any reason for this Court to 

override that determination, to second guess the 

judgment of the Texas court that the judgment is not 

final until the reinstated appeal concludes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What happens -- just out of 

curiosity, a prisoner's lawyer doesn't take the appeal, 

the time expires, bong, the year begins to run. Within 

that year he files federal habeas. Then he discovers 

that he had a right to a state appeal. So he goes, just 

like this man, goes back and, sure enough, he gets his 

direct appeal, and three years later or a year later 

they finish the direct appeal. Bong, he can file again.

 Is that his first habeas or his second 

habeas?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I have to ask one question, 

sir, because the answer is it depends.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The question is, when he

files for Federal habeas corpus the first time in your 

hypothetical, I take it he doesn't raise the claim --

JUSTICE BREYER: No.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: He raises a substantive 

claim, like the judge was biased against him and the 

like?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: That is regarded as a first 

habeas application, because the claim did not -- I think 

the judgment did not arise until later. I don't believe 

a case like that has arisen. I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: I doubt that one -- I mean, 

one may never arise but --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: The strange thing is that it 

is an exhausted set of claims. So it is a proper 

Federal habeas corpus application, because he went to --

JUSTICE BREYER: The first one is proper and 

on your view so is the second one proper. So they are 

both proper, and there are two of them. And --

MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's proper in terms of it 

being exhausted. It would be dismissed, to be clear. 

So his appeal was denied, right? He doesn't file an 

appeal in the hypothetical. So when he shows up in 

Federal district court, it's an exhausted -- it is -- he 

would be dismissed for failure to exhaust, in fact,

JUSTICE BREYER: No, nobody knows about 

this.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: But he -- but he was --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, but nobody knows that 

the State made a mistake in not giving him a direct 

review.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Your hypothetical, Justice 

Breyer, I took it to be --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, forget my hypothetical. 

They're never going to come up.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I think, though, I can tell 

you this with some confidence. The way that this thing 

happened in Texas is the way that it happens in the 

States, and the way it happens in Federal courts as well 

under 2255. You file a post-conviction application. 

You say: I was denied entirely my right of appeal by 

something the court did or something my lawyer did, and 

then you get to pursue your appeal.

 And that's what Congress wanted the Federal 

district court on habeas corpus to review. So 

logically, the one year begins to run after that's done.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, except that 

you kind of elide the point that Congress and AEDPA 

quite clearly wanted these federal claims to be brought

within a year. This seems to allow the State processes 

to trump the one-year requirement.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, in many cases, 

Mr. Chief Justice, of course, the State appeals can take 

20 years to go up and down and back and forth from State 

post-conviction review. We also have the rather 

commonplace case in which a defendant doesn't file a 

notice of appeal at all, as in Justice Breyer's 

hypothetical, but the court of appeal says, you know, 

for good cause we are going to let you file this appeal 

late.

 And it's quite clear in that scenario, so 

your appeal is reinstated there, too, because you were 

20 days late, 30 days late on the filing deadline. It's 

quite clear and I think agreed in all of those 

situations that, while Congress did want you to move 

expeditiously, the question is move expeditiously from 

when. And it's from the State court's direct review, 

finishing the conclusion of direct review.

 And we know that Congress recognized that 

that wouldn't always be one year from the end of the 

case the first time around from the structure of (B), 

(C), and (D); and the fact that if there were a 

tie-breaker at all, it is that the statute shall -- the 

limitation period shall run from the latest of several

days. So Congress quite clearly contemplated that there 

would be multiple possible start dates.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You said that it's 

unusual for the Texas State to grant these. But 

presumably you could challenge the determination five, 

ten, 15 years later by the Texas court not to grant you 

a direct appeal.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm not sure I understand 

the -- the hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice. If -- if 

you lose your post-conviction application for it?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah. Let's say 

this fellow -- the State court says, well, you know 

what, we are not going to give you another direct 

appeal. And he says, well, that decision was made in 

violation of my federal constitutional rights. What 

happens then with respect to federal habeas?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, he is challenging his 

original -- Federal habeas corpus is reviewing the 

judgment in his case. He has, since there was only one 

conclusion of direct review in his case, one year 

measured from the first dismissal, tolled only during 

the period of pending post-conviction application.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But is he 

challenging the first conviction, or is he challenging 

the failure of the State court to give him another

direct appeal?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: He is challenging the fact 

that he was denied a direct appeal, which is a challenge 

to his actual conviction. That is a constitutional flaw 

in his conviction. And so it runs from the conclusion 

of the direct review, not from anything related to 

post-conviction review.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's I 

gather if he is granted the collateral -- the direct --

second direct appeal. What if the Court says no, we 

don't agree that you were denied your right to a direct 

appeal; we think you had it so you don't get another 

one. And he says that determination has been made in 

violation of the Federal Constitution.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: The fact that the State 

post-conviction court did not remedy a violation of his 

constitutional rights on direct review does not create a 

new constitutional violation. The constitutional 

violation in your hypothetical arises on direct review.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, doesn't it 

depend upon the allegation he wishes to make? Say he 

comes in in one of these proceedings four and a half 

years later and says, you should give me another direct 

review, I didn't have it. And the court says, well, no, 

we're not going to give you one. And he says, well, you

give it to all the white criminal defendants and you are 

not giving it to me, so that violates equal protection?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I don't think so. And if I 

could just explain -- give an analogy. Say he could 

make the same allegation about ineffective assistance of 

trial counsel. You can always try and recharacterize 

your claim as the post-conviction court violated my 

constitutional rights by not vindicating my original 

constitutional rights, my right to constitutionally 

effective counsel at trial or on appeal. And the 

Federal habeas courts uniformly reject those efforts to 

recharacterize. The constitutional violation arises in 

the original criminal case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess my 

hypothetical supposes a new constitutional violation. 

And I am just suggesting that the fact that Texas 

doesn't grant this relief freely doesn't mean that 

that's a sufficient answer with respect to the abuse of 

federal habeas.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: I understand, 

Mr. Chief Justice. I think that body of cases is 

relatively narrow as it arises, and it also isn't 

implicated here.

 If the Court has no further questions, I 

will reserve the remainder of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN D. JORDAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. JORDAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Congress's commitment to preventing 

unnecessary delays in the filing of Federal habeas 

claims is reflected in section 2244(d)(1)'s strict 

one-year limitations period. And it did not intend that 

inmates who wait for years before seeking 

post-conviction review would obtain a new Federal 

limitation start date when an out-of-time appeal is 

awarded.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why should that be, 

given the fact that the day it is going to run from is 

the day that -- which the State of Texas is willing to 

take action. And if Texas is willing to let the matter 

ride as long as it rode here, why shouldn't the one-year 

statute apply?

 In other words, I guess what I'm saying is 

the -- the decision about what is appropriate, that, 

in effect, would start this period running, is Texas's 

And as long as Texas is -- is satisfied with it, why 

does AEDPA have an independent concern?

MR. JORDAN: Your Honor, the reason is that 

in (d)(1)(A) Congress set a uniform Federal rule for 

finality. And that finality date is either when the --

the period of direct review ends by the conclusion of 

direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking 

direct review.

 So when that happens, by statute, Congress 

has said that the (d)(1)(A) finality date is attached.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but that -- in effect, 

I think that begs the question, because if -- if Texas 

says: Okay, we are going to -- we are going to 

recognize a direct appeal starting -- or a direct-appeal 

right exercisable now, then (d)(1)(A) applies by its own 

terms exactly at the -- at the conclusion of the process 

which Texas has at this date chosen to allow.

 Texas doesn't have any gripe. It decided it 

ought to act, and -- and, undoubtedly, it should have.

 As long as the -- as long as the State is 

protected, why is there an independent interest in 

enforcing AEDPA, or enforcing the shortest possible rule 

under AEDPA?

 MR. JORDAN: Justice Souter, there is an 

independent Federal interest that the Court has 

recognized consistently in avoiding abusive and 

unnecessary delay in the filing of Federal habeas

claims.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yeah, but we are -- we are 

concerned about State interests, aren't we?

 MR. JORDAN: Certainly, Justice Souter, and 

comity and finality are important purposes of AEDPA. 

But another recognized and important purpose of AEDPA is 

to avoid, you know, abusive and unnecessary delays in 

the filing of Federal habeas claims. So even if a State 

court would allow stale claims years later to be heard, 

that doesn't mean that Federal courts need to hear those 

claims 10, 15 or 20 years later.

 But there is a second point, Justice Souter, 

that -- that is a problem with interpreting (d)(1)(A) in 

the manner the Petitioner suggests, which is that it 

will make it far more difficult for Federal courts to 

administer that statute. Because if the Court 

interprets "direct review" to bring in Texas and all the 

50 States various remedies for ineffective assistance of 

counsel on appeal, then what that means is you are no 

longer going to have a uniform Federal rule for finality 

in any of these cases.

 What you are going to have is a patchwork of 

-- of various dates, and the -- the reality is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you have got a -- in 

a sense, you have got a patchwork now. I mean not --

not every State rule for the commencement of a direct 

appeal in the normal course is -- is identical. So we 

-- we start with a patchwork.

 MR. JORDAN: But the difference is stark, 

Justice Souter, because the -- the dates that the States 

use for deadlines on initial direct appeal, the vast 

majority, are within a short timeframe, 20 days to 

90 days, the vast majority. Whereas, these remedies for 

out-of-time appeals are genuinely varied, and they vary 

over time in the States.

 And if I could give you a couple of examples 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But aren't they -- and I 

will -- you know, I will take the examples, but I mean, 

aren't they varied because the -- the circumstances of 

error which led to these late appeals vary, too? And 

isn't that exactly the way it ought to be?

 MR. JORDAN: Well, it is correct, Justice 

Souter, that some States -- the remedy varies with the 

type of ineffective assistance of counsel, for example, 

the difference between not filing a notice of appeal or 

not filing a brief.

 But my point is that those remedies -- the 

Petitioner's brief -- opening brief at pages 29 to 32 

says: This is going to be easy for Federal courts to

apply, because what they can do is look at these six 

different aspects of the nature of the remedy in each 

State, and they can determine from that whether --

when -- whether it should be a new start date or just 

tolling. The --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can't we leave 

that -- and you suggest that it is a Federal rule. I am 

not sure that's right. Why don't we just leave that up 

to the States? I am not -- if I don't accept your 

friend's determination that this is a matter of 

substance rather than form, States have it -- excuse 

me -- within their control. Here -- your State calls it 

another direct appeal.

 Why don't we just take them at their word? 

And if they don't want to get into the business of 

having a Federal review of a second direct appeal that 

they choose to allow, they just call it something else. 

Call it a -- you know, the collateral review of a 

successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel 

and file whatever. And then, you know, under AEDPA that 

wouldn't count as a new final judgment.

 MR. JORDAN: Well, it's -- it's true, Your 

Honor, that the -- that States can fashion whatever 

remedy they want. And in terms of the comity and 

finality interests, it is going to be a responsibility

of the States if they want to change their law. But 

because in -- in these out-of-time appeals -- and most 

of the States' remedies look somewhat like in --

somewhat like Texas in the sense that they are coming 

through post-conviction review and they -- they are 

awarding another, if you will, chance for the inmate to 

assert his claims. There is not a reason for the court 

to strain the interpretation of (d)(1)(A) to protect the 

State's interest --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why -- why is it a strain? 

I mean suppose that Texas decided to give every criminal 

defendant convicted one thousand years to appeal. You 

know, if they did, I guess they would have one more year 

after that to go to Federal habeas, right?

 MR. JORDAN: That's true, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Then what's the 

difference between that, giving them a thousand years, 

which I doubt they will do, and what they have said 

here? They said for purposes of the Texas rules all 

time limits shall be calculated as if the sentence had 

been imposed on the date that the mandate of this court 

issues.

 There they are. The Texas Supreme Court 

gave him all that time, it's whatever it was, and said 

that's the time you have. How, how is that different

 MR. JORDAN: It's true, Your Honor, that the 

-- that the -- the Texas court made a decision to give a 

remedy to this inmate that was meant to duplicate the 

type of claims he could have raised on direct appeal. 

Our position is that does not change the finality date 

under (d)(1)(A), because by statute, Congress has said 

that that date attaches at the -- at the expiration of 

direct review. And -- and the natural reading of that 

language --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I -- I was 

just going to stop you there. It doesn't say that 

starts to run at the expiration of direct review. It 

says on the date the judgment became final.

 MR. JORDAN: That's correct, Your Honor, and 

it says, it became final by --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- by the conclusion 

of direct review.

 MR. JORDAN: Or the expiration of the time 

for seeking such review. And the importance there, Your 

Honor, is that it -- it anticipates one of two events 

occurring. In other words, the natural reading is 

Congress understood that in some cases there wasn't 

going to be a conclusion of direct review. There was

going to be an expiration of time for seeking review. 

And at that point finality would attach.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Even though, as in this 

case, it turned out he found out within a year. But 

suppose he didn't find out for more than a year; that 

is, he didn't find out that -- that the appeal had been 

filed, and he didn't find out about the dismissal? So 

because either his counsel or the State blundered, he is 

out in the cold, and he can never present his direct-

appeal claim.

 MR. JORDAN: Not necessarily, Justice 

Ginsburg, and that's the reason why Congress already 

provided exceptions in the statute in the form of 

subsections (b) through (d) that provide later start 

dates for extenuating circumstances beyond the inmate's 

control.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldstein just 

explained to us why those two provisions, the (b) and 

(d) would not work. That this --

MR. JORDAN: I understand, Your Honor. And, 

respectfully, I disagree -- I disagree with that, and 

here is the reason why (d)(1)(B) applies. And (d)(1)(B) 

applies because in -- for example, in this case you had 

the -- a finding that there was constitutionally 

ineffective assistance of counsel to the extent of

abandoning the inmate on appeal.

 And this Court's precedent has said that 

when there is -- in the trial or on direct appeal, when 

there is ineffectiveness of counsel that amounts to 

abandonment, that winds up being imputed to the State 

because it means that the State got or -- or kept a 

conviction by the violation of the inmate's due-process 

rights.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you have a case 

to cite for that? Because I understood your friend to 

say the opposite: That wouldn't count as an impediment.

 MR. JORDAN: I do --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do I resolve 

that dispute?

 MR. JORDAN: I do, Your Honor. You -- you 

need -- need to look no longer than the case that is 

cited in both briefs. It is Evitts versus Lucey, and it 

is cited in the Petitioner's brief at pages 27 and 37, 

and it is cited in our brief at pages 36 and 37.

 It is also in another case not cited in the 

brief, but it is also noted in Coleman versus Thompson. 

In other words, the Court has consistently said that 

where there is constructive denial of counsel that 

amounts to no assistance at all and the State thereby 

obtains and retains a conviction, there -- that will be

imputed to the State. Now, the difficult part in 

getting (d)(1)(B), a later date under (d)(1)(B), is that 

you also need the causal connection, because you can't 

just have the ineffective assistance of counsel. It 

also has to have caused the inmate not to be able to 

file his -- his timely Federal habeas. That happened in 

this case because the ineffective assistance of counsel 

resulted in the inmate having a lack of notice. The 

attorney did not serve the Anders brief on the inmate 

and he gave the wrong address to the court. So the 

court wound up sending the judgment to the wrong address 

and the inmate didn't know.

 That's why we say in those circumstances 

(d)(1)(B) is implicated. But it's worth noting that 

even if we measure the date from September of 1997 or we 

give him a new date under (d)(1)(B), then that's the 

date that he admits, he acknowledges, he knew his State 

appeal had failed. From that date, he waited four and a 

half years to seek any type of post-conviction review. 

And then -- and the importance of that is that Congress 

intended to give a year, a strict one-year period. This 

inmate could have invoked (d)(1)(B) and he did not and 

he waited four and a half years from the date he could

Texas could have gone into the State court and said: 

Don't give him the direct review; he waited four and a 

half years after he -- but the State didn't ask for 

that.

 MR. JORDAN: That's correct, Your Honor. 

The State did not assert a laches defense, but I have --

there is two points on that: One is that the only case 

-- there is one case and it's cited in the brief, Ex 

parte Carrio. It's cited in the Petitioner's brief. 

There's one case in the last 150 years of Texas 

jurisprudence where laches has actual been asserted and 

an appeal has been -- I'm sorry -- habeas has been 

denied based on that.

 And we are not talking about -- we are not 

asserting laches here. We are talking about the running 

of his Federal limitations period under a Federal 

statute. And what we are saying is this inmate was 

clearly not diligent, and this inmate could have had a 

later start date, but even from that later start date 

he would -- he would -- the Federal period would have 

expired.

 I would like to address quickly the (d)(2) 

point because I think it's important. The reference was 

made that (d)(2) doesn't work, In other words (d)(2) 

tolling won't work in this case because of the Court's

decision in Lawrence. And that's -- that's not true, 

because the situation in Lawrence was different.

 In Lawrence, the Court's decision said that 

inmate had exhausted all of his post-conviction review 

in the Florida courts. He had gone all the way to the 

top court. There was no State court left for him to go 

to. And the question was, when he then came to this 

Court with a cert petition, could that cert petition 

count as tolling time of review for the State 

post-conviction review? The Court said no.

 That's not the case here. This is more like 

the Court's decision in Carey versus Saffold, where in, 

Carey, the Court said -- the Court acknowledged that 

under California law where inmates can, if they lose 

their habeas in a lower court, they can then file an 

original writ in a higher court. The Court said that, 

while the inmate is going through that process, the 

collateral review of the underlying judgment remained 

pending, it remained in continuance.

 And that's what's happening here. If you 

look at what happened in the Texas court, when the 

inmate files his habeas petition, the habeas petition 

itself is not reviewing the pertinent judgment. That's 

the language of (d)(2), "reviewing the pertinent 

judgment." That habeas petition asks for a second

proceeding to review the pertinent judgment. It says, 

can you give me another proceeding, the out-of-time 

appeal, to review the pertinent judgment? And so, when 

the inmate receives that, when he -- if he gets the 

out-of-time appeal, then the next step, the out-of-time 

appeal, is where the judgment is reviewed.

 So, the Court's rationale in Carey is 

applicable with even greater force here because the 

State courts have told him: File another -- you know, 

continue your proceeding so you can get review of the 

underlying judgment. And it anticipates a two-step 

process. So you might say that the out-of-time appeal 

is the remedy portion of the habeas proceeding in Texas. 

And that's why the (d)(2) tolling does work and Lawrence 

does not defeat that. And in this case, that means that 

the inmate, if he had acted timely, he could have filed 

his State post-conviction petition. If he had obtained 

an out-of-time appeal, he could -- the tolling would 

have gone on while -- throughout the out-of-time appeal. 

And then if he had lost that, he could have then gone to 

Federal court. And so --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're saying that 

(2) has a negative implication.

 MR. JORDAN: I'm sorry?

had a negative implication. In other words, the time 

shall not be counted while it's pending and that it 

should be counted if it's not pending and you are not 

diligent.

 MR. JORDAN: That's -- well, that's correct, 

Your Honor, in the sense that if the State -- some 

collateral review in State court has to be pending for 

tolling to be going on. And what we are saying is that 

for the out-of-time appeal process in Texas, it does 

remain pending. The reason it remains pending is that 

that first habeas petition is asking for, and if the 

inmate gets it is receiving, further collateral review 

of that judgment because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: When you say "the 

first habeas petition" you mean the first State habeas 

petition?

 MR. JORDAN: That's correct, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. I'm sorry.

 MR. JORDAN: And that first State habeas 

petition -- if you look -- if you look in the record, 

you will see the State habeas petition doesn't challenge 

anything about the underlying judgment. It doesn't say, 

give me relief on any particular claim. What it says 

is, give me an out-of-time appeal proceeding so that I 

can challenge the underlying judgment. And so, when the

review of the underlying judgment, (d)(2) tolling still 

applies. And that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What do 

you mean, "(d)(2) tolling still applies"? That the 

direct appeal time does not count against his one year?

 MR. JORDAN: That's correct. The 

out-of-time appeal time, Your Honor, won't count. So 

what we'll go on is that if his habeas was granted and 

he was allowed the out-of-time appeal, he could pursue 

the out-of-time appeal. The tolling of the Federal 

limitations period under (d)(2) would remain during that 

entire time, if he then loses his out-of-time appeal and 

he comes out of the other side of the process.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's assuming that he 

files the appeal within one year, right?

 MR. JORDAN: That's -- I mean, if he does, 

that's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if he doesn't?

 MR. JORDAN: If he doesn't file his State 

habeas within one year?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What if he doesn't find out 

about the fact that notice, proper notice, wasn't given 

to his counsel, so he doesn't find out about the 

gravamen for the appeal until after a year?

 MR. JORDAN: Your Honor, two points in 

response. The first is that -- is that I'm assuming, in 

your hypothetical, that it is an inmate who has 

attempted to be diligent, has attempted to contact the 

court.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Right.

 MR. JORDAN: And if he has attempted to 

contact the court and he still had not found out, the 

circumstances -- I mean, we've looked at a lot of these 

cases and there is just very few out there where an 

inmate who is being diligent is not going to be able to 

find out one way or the other. So, it may be that if he 

wasn't able to, he might fall under (d)(1)(B). But if 

he didn't, Your Honor, and it was an unusual -- and it 

would have to be a very unusual circumstance -- it might 

be that equitable tolling could apply. But this Court 

has recognized, in Dodd v. United States, in 

interpreting the similar provisions in the counterpart

to 2244(d)(1)(C), in the context of when the Court 

recognizes a retroactively applicable --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think (d)(1)(B) 

does. It requires an impediment to have been removed. 

There is no impediment being removed. He just didn't 

find out the facts.

 MR. JORDAN: Well, presumably, Your Honor, 

the reason that he didn't would have -- if he was being 

diligent, if he was -- because he needs to be diligent. 

He can't just sit in his cell --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. Right.

 MR. JORDAN: -- and say, "I'm not going to 

do anything." If he is being diligent and if he is 

really attempting to find out what happened to his case, 

then probably something has happened, either, you know, 

through the State system or through the attorney. But 

if it has not -- you know, again, we've looked at a lot 

of these cases. We haven't seen cases like that, but --

mean, it's a hypothetical.

his appeal, you know, and time passes; doesn't take it. 

Then, five years later, he learns for the first time and 

the first time he could have learned that his lawyer 

tore up the notification. At that point, (1)(B) comes 

into play. So the year begins to run.

 Then, in your idea, he has -- he has a year 

to go to Federal court. But wait, it's tolled while he 

goes to State court. So he goes to State court having 

just learned it. And now he's under (2) and he files a 

habeas in State. Now the remedy of the State habeas is 

to reopen the direct appeal. But we should count that, 

since it's a remedy of a habeas, as if it were a 

continuation of the habeas and therefore it would fall 

within (2). That's your argument.

 MR. JORDAN: Exactly.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And it's -- correct? I do 

not think there is any case ever considered that to my 

knowledge.

 MR. JORDAN: No --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- and the only difficulty 

of it is that you have to take a sort of leap of faith 

of some kind in attaching what everybody's calling the 

direct appeal as if it were actually part of the State 

habeas proceeding. That's I think the hardest part of 

your argument.

JUSTICE SCALIA: There is more of a problem 

than that, as the other side just said. (1)(B), which 

is the gimmick you are using to get out of this, doesn't 

speak of not being able to find out in time; it speaks 

of the date on which the impediment to file an 

application --

JUSTICE BREYER: (D).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- is removed.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It's not (B), it's (D).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, you said (D), not (B).

 JUSTICE BREYER: (D).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought, 

Counsel, that your response to that was when you have a 

failure of counsel, that that is imputed to the State. 

So it is a removal of an impediment created by the 

State.

 MR. JORDAN: That's -- that's correct, 

Mr. Chief Justice. That's -- under the Court's decision 

is cases like Evitts v Lucey, if there has been a 

constructive denial of counsel, an abandonment of 

counsel to the degree where there was effectively no 

appeal, then that could be imputed to the State. The 

reasoning has been that it's because the State was able 

to get or keep a conviction without the inmate having 

due process. That would be -- the inmate would still

have to have the fact that that impediment actually 

caused him to -- and this case is a good example.

 Even though this inmate -- you know, there 

was ineffectiveness of counsel -- if the court had the 

right address, and court had sent him the judgment, then 

there would not have been the causal connection; he 

wouldn't have been able to get the (d)(1)(D) date.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The problem with (1)(D) is 

that the claim or claims presented that is referred to 

in (D) is not the denial of the appeal. It's the claim 

or claims that he wants to bring in his Federal habeas. 

That's why (1)(D) doesn't work, you have to go back to 

(1)(B).

 I'm talking to you.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: But I think it's a good 

point.

 MR. JORDAN: Well, you are exactly right, 

Justice Scalia, that (d)(1)(D), in this case, because it 

is claim-specific it only does apply to the ineffective 

assistance of counsel on appeal. We noted in our brief 

that it was implicated, but because he got relief on 

that claim in the State court, there was no reason for 

him to -- so he wouldn't have -- the (D) was implicated 

but didn't need to be asserted.

We are that saying (d)(1)(B) --

JUSTICE SCALIA: (B).

 MR. JORDAN: -- is -- is -- in play in the 

case because of the unique circumstances of this -- of 

this --

JUSTICE BREYER: Between your response to 

the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia, I stand 

enlightened.

 MR. JORDAN: It's the interplay of these two 

-- of these two provisions, because both of them in any 

particular case could be in play. If the -- - if, for 

example, this inmate had not gotten relief in the State 

court for his ineffectiveness of counsel on appeal, then 

the (d)(1)(D) could have provided a later start date for 

that claim. It's (d)(1)(B) that applies to the other 

claims. And the -- you know, the bottom line notion for 

our position is that it cannot be that Congress intended 

in this -- this statute to be interpreted such that a 

non-diligent inmate who waits four and a half years 

after he knows his appeal has failed to seek any sort of 

post-conviction relief will obtain a new start date.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's your fault.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Justice could have -- not 

only, that don't some States have a limitation period 

when -- when he finds out that his appeal has been

dismissed, without notice to him, aren't there some 

States, criminal justice systems, that say from the date 

that you had knowledge, you have X days to file?

 MR. JORDAN: Yes, Your Honor. There are a 

number of States that have -- if we are talking about 

remedies for ineffective assistance of counsel on 

appeal, there are a number of States that have 

deadlines; but there are at least 19 States that provide 

remedies for ineffectiveness of counsel on appeal with 

no statute of limitations.

 And in -- and in those States and in many 

cases what that means is that the inmate, like this 

inmate, could come five years later, ten years later, 

and make those claims.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, do I understand 

correctly that, based on your answers and your friend's 

answers, there is no difference between the way you two 

in substance read these provisions? He relies on 

(d)(1)(A); you rely on the combination of (d)(2) and 

(d)(1)(B) and (d); except in the situation where you 

have a non-diligent prisoner, and in that case, his 

theory leads to a different result than yours.

 He excuses the non-diligence because the 

State chooses to label the second opportunity as final. 

You do not excuse the non-diligence because in the

absence of diligence, (d)(1)(B) and (d)(1)(D) do not 

apply.

 MR. JORDAN: That's correct, Mr. Chief 

Justice. And I'd like to address a point that's made in 

the reply brief, about --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Then it comes down 

-- it does come down to his, where he began his 

argument, which is he said that this is an unusual case 

where Texas is being overly generous to convicts, 

because you choose to label it as direct appeal and 

therefore that means someone that the States allow to 

have another direct appeal, even though they have been 

non-diligent, get the benefit of the -- of a new 

finality date.

 MR. JORDAN: That's correct, Your Honor, and 

our position is that Texas -- not Texas or any State can 

rewrite the -- this Federal statute and a finality date 

in this Federal statute. But I want to address quickly 

the point that's made in a reply brief that the Court 

not worry about this because there is no incentive for 

non-capital inmates to -- to sit on their rights. And I 

have two points I want to make on that.

 The first is Congress has already made that 

decision. Obviously Congress was concerned that even 

non-capital inmates could sit on their rights because

they imposed this strict one-year limitation on 

non-capital inmates. But the second point is that as a 

practical matter this happens in many, many cases. 

These cases provide the example. In this case the 

inmate waited five years. The Frasch v Peguese case 

that is coming out of the Fourth Circuit on an 

out-of-time appeal, the inmate -- a non-capital inmate 

waited ten years to seek post-conviction review. And so 

these are cases that we think are representative of many 

case that would come through the district courts, and 

that in fact non-capital inmates, whatever their 

incentives may be, do as a practical matter sometimes 

sit on their rights.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Convicted felons don't 

always make intelligent decisions, you are saying.

 MR. JORDAN: That's correct. And the 

problem is that when -- when for whatever reason they 

sit on their rights ten or 15 years, our point is that 

that doesn't mean they can come back in and have Federal 

courts hearing stale claims that should have been 

brought, if the inmate was being diligent, years 

earlier.

 And there's -- and this case is a case in 

point. This inmate has -- has provided no reason why --

no legitimate reason why he waited four and a half

years. The only reason he provided was I am a pro se 

inmate and I -- I don't know what the law S. And you 

can his data in the joint appendix pages 109 to 112, and 

those are directly rejected by the court in the Johnson 

case, Johnson v United States. The court said in that 

case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Am I correct that on the 

underlying merits of the basic claims, that each -- his 

lawyer filed an Anders brief?

 MR. JORDAN: That's correct, Justice --

JUSTICE STEVENS: He's probably not a very

succeeding, I wouldn't suppose.

 Isn't this characteristic of this category 

of cases, that really most of them heard are pretty 

frivolous?

 MR. JORDAN: Your Honor, a lot of them are. 

A lot of them are, and in fact there were two Anders 

briefs filed in this case. To show how -- how weak his 

claims were, when he got the out-of-time appeal, he was 

appointed a new attorney and she filed an Anders brief. 

So you had two attorneys in this case who said --

case is we are fighting about the limitations and 

whether it applies and so forth; you probably could have

to be left with the impression that this is much ado 

about nothing. The rule of law will actually be quite 

significant.

 Two small corrections to things my friend 

inadvertently said or impressions he may have 

inadvertently left. He says there are 19 States that 

have no statute of limitations, but that omits the very 

many of those States that apply laches, and the fact 

that the State of Texas here did not assert the 

untimeliness of the State post-conviction proceeding is 

pretty much I think why we are ultimately here.

 He also said that there is only one State 

opinion finding laches, as if, I think, to create the 

impression that Texas courts don't take laches 

seriously. Most of these are disposed of without 

opinions. But the more relevant important is that there 

aren't Texas State opinions rejecting claims of laches. 

What the Texas courts have made is that the Texas A.G.'s 

office has to assert the defense of laches, as is true 

everywhere and is true in this Court's jurisprudence as 

well.

 The final two points I wanted to make are 

about (d)(1)(B) and (d)(2), all of which, I think 

honestly reduced to Justice Kennedy's point, is that the

in the case. But Justice Scalia and the Chief Justice 

came back to the point about whether this is an 

impediment, and my friend kept answering it is State 

action, and the Court would say, but is it an 

impediment?

 And at page 20 of our reply brief we must 

cite eight or ten cases, three of which notably are from 

Texas; there were litigated by the Texas Attorney 

General's office, that make it clear that the failure to 

give the notice of the opinion is not an impediment to 

filing post-conviction review, and the Court would be 

rewriting a lot of habeas corpus law to rule for the 

State of Texas here.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about -- he 

cited most prominently the Evitts case.

 MR. JORDAN: That's a State action, but as 

the Court's questioning indication, the question is, is 

State action that is an impediment to filing a Federal 

habeas petition, and all of our cases answered that 

question.

 The final point is about (d)(2) and my 

friend says that this isn't like Lawrence v Florida, 

because here there is more proceedings. But the Court's 

holding was this, and it was unambiguous: When the 

post-conviction court enters its mandate, so that the

time to seek cert starts to run, that's when the 

post-conviction application is no longer pending; and 

when the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals decided the 

Petitioner's claim and said he had an out-of-time 

appeal, it issued its mandate and the mandate is in the 

joint appendix. And somebody -- the State could have 

sought cert in that case, and the post-conviction 

application was no longer pending.

 And Mr. Chief Justice, you're right, you can 

the case on the basis of label or substance, but it is 

unambiguous that this is not post-conviction review in 

what we have been calling the second appeal. Teague 

retroactivity does not apply; all the constitutional 

rights that are announced in the meantime apply; you 

have a right to a counsel; the usual standards of 

post-conviction relief in terms of having us show an 

extra layer of prejudice don't apply.

 This is just like any other appeal the Texas 

Court of Appeals and the courts of criminal appeal would 

decide and that makes it a (d)(1) case.

 Thank you very much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 1:58 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
