CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 11-1274, Gabelli and 

Alpert v. the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Mr. Liman. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS LIMAN 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

MR. LIMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

This case concerns the statute dealing 

exclusively with penalty claims brought by government 

agencies to punish conduct made unlawful by statute. 

Congress provided a clear and easily administered 

statutory time limitation on the government's power to 

punish: 5 years, except as otherwise provided by 

Congress. 

The case does not concern -- the statute 

does not concern the government's power to seek remedial 

remedies such as disgorgement and injunction. 

Consistent with -- Congress's normal approach in penal 

situations, Congress fixed a statute of limitations for 

penalties. The court below, for the first time over the 

century the statute has been in existence, sweepingly 

concluded that unless Congress clearly directed

otherwise, the statute and the 5 years did not begin to 

run from the time the defendant violated the law, the 

ordinary rule for statutes providing for accrual, but 

instead --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Liman. Mr. Liman, 

you -- you are typing this a penalty case. The 

government says yes the accrual is the ordinary rule, but 

discovery is the rule when there is fraud, and fraud is 

alleged here. So how does the Court decide whether to 

type this case a penalty case, as you urge, or a fraud 

case, as the government urged -- urges, when both 

captions fit? 

MR. LIMAN: Your Honor, I think there are 

two answers to that. First is that the Court doesn't 

need to decide, Congress has decided. Congress made it 

quite clear that the rule of accrual applied to all 

penalty claims. And as this Court held in 

Clark v. Martinez, the same word in a statute cannot be 

given different interpretations depending on the 

underlying statute to which it is applied. 

The second reason, though, Justice Ginsburg, 

is that it is not correct to say, and this Court has 

never said, that either the Bailey rule or the injury 

accrual rule applies to a statutory fraud claim where 

the government is seeking to punish. That would -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Excuse me. 

Justice Ginsburg points out that you're talking about 

the statute, but the statute uses the term "accrual." 

Is it correct to say that the term "accrual" is not used 

in statute of limitations for crimes -- generally -- for 

crimes? 

MR. LIMAN: For -- for crimes, the general 

word that is used is time period from the violation. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. And this -- and 

this talks about accrual. So that is indicative -- is 

indicative of the fact that Congress is using a civil 

analogue in the drafting of this statute. 

MR. LIMAN: Your Honor, it indicates that 

Congress is using accrual as it is understood at common 

law. Common law, it means when the claim becomes ripe 

and the plaintiff has the ability to sue. What that 

means is, as the D.C. Circuit said in 3M -- and we think 

the D.C. Circuit got it right on this -- that you look 

to the underlying statute pursuant to which the 

government is seeking a penalty to see when the claim 

became ripe. 

In a penalty situation, and under the IAA, 

which is what this concerns -- it doesn't concern a 

common law fraud claim; it doesn't concern a claim where 

there's even any element of deception that's required.

It's a breach of fiduciary duty. What the IAA says is 

that the government can sue when the violation occurs. 

Now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Liman, I understand 

your argument, but I have a fundamental difficulty, 

okay? 

Bailey and Exploration Company, with 

statutes not too dissimilar from this one, who read the 

discovery rule into a fraud claim, both for a civil 

litigant and for the government. The only way that I 

can tease out a potential difference between Exploration 

and this case is somehow that the penalty in this case 

is not for injury, but for punishment, as you called it. 

Government as enforcer, rather than government as 

victim. 

Some of us would say that the common wheel 

is injured whenever someone breaks a law, so that that 

distinction between enforcer and victim makes no sense. 

How do you answer that point? 

MR. LIMAN: Justice Sotomayor, let me give 

you the precise answer to that, which is that in this 

case where the government is seeking a penalty, it is 

not acting on behalf of underlying investors, and the 

recovery is not one that is brought by way of damages or 

disgorgement.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It's acting as a 

sovereign to protect what it thinks is an ordered 

society. And if you break that order, you are injuring 

the society. That -- that's the best --

MR. LIMAN: Your Honor, I think that is the 

articulation that the government would have to make. 

don't think it holds up, for several reasons. First of 

all, it would represent an extreme departure from 

anything this Court has ever held or, to our knowledge, 

any court has ever held with respect to the application 

of the discovery rule. 

Second, when you're talking about penalty, 

you're not talking about recovery to -- to victims. 

Third, when we're talking about implying a rule, which 

is what the government's argument is here -- it's not an 

argument to follow the plain language, it's an argument 

to depart from the plain language -- you should look at, 

and the cases direct you to look at, the policy 

concerns. And when you're talking about discover -- a 

discovery rule with respect to the government as 

enforcer, the rules don't work. They don't work for 

several reasons. 

First of all, when you've got an injury, a 

party who is injured, the statute of limitations has a 

natural start date that is not in control of the

plaintiff. There is a relationship to the underlying 

violation. And that can be readily measured. None of 

that is true when you're talking about the government in 

a law enforcement capacity. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Liman, what you 

suggested, when we talked about the discovery rule, is 

that it has its basis in the notion that a defendant with 

unclean hands who has committed deceptive conduct 

preventing the plaintiff from understanding that he or 

it has a cause of action -- you know, shouldn't be 

entitled to the benefit of a statute of limitations. 

And if that's the understanding that lies 

behind the discovery rule, I guess the question for you 

is, why doesn't it apply in this case, as well as, in 

a case where the person bringing the action has 

himself suffered a harm? 

MR. LIMAN: Justice Kagan, I've got two 

answers to that question as well. The first is that --

that I don't think is the basis for the -- for the 

discovery rule at bottom. The basis for the discovery 

rule -- if you look at this Court's opinion in -- in 

Rotella, if you look at the Seventh Circuit in Cada, the 

D.C. Circuit in Connor -- is the notion that when the 

plaintiff cannot discover the injury, doesn't know that 

it's been injured, and cannot reasonably know that the

plaintiff's been injured, the plaintiff cannot take the 

steps that other plaintiffs would take to investigate 

and determine whether they've got a cause of action. 

That's not applicable in a government 

enforcement context because you're not talking about 

there the government as a victim. The government may 

not know of the underlying transaction, will not know of 

the underlying transaction, unless the government asks. 

The second reason is that there is a strain 

that -- in the Bailey line of cases -- that really 

speaks in terms of equitable tolling and fraudulent 

concealment, that sort of a notion of unclean -- unclean 

hands. That's not in this case because the government 

affirmatively took it out. But we would submit --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How did the government 

take it out? I mean, the point here is that there was a 

concealment. There was a hiding of what was -- the 

impermissible action. 

MR. LIMAN: That's -- that's not correct, 

Justice Ginsburg. If you'd look at the -- at the 

opinion below and you look at the complaint, the essence 

of the allegation, which we have not yet had a chance to 

disprove before you on a motion to dismiss, is that 

there were misrepresentations and omissions made to the 

board of the mutual fund. There was no

misrepresentations made to the investing public. That 

allegation is not in the complaint. It would not be 

accurate. And there is no allegation whatsoever that 

anything was hidden from the government or was in any 

way concealed from the government. The records here 

would have been available -- were available for the 

government to look at, at any time. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Liman, finishing up 

a point you were just on previously, what's your 

position with respect to fraudulent concealment? 

Doesn't your theory preclude even the application of 

that to tolling of the statute? 

MR. LIMAN: Your Honor, I think you could 

and should conclude -- that if you reach that issue. 

don't think you need to reach that issue. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But tell me about --

MR. LIMAN: Our theory doesn't require you 

to come to that conclusion. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: This is -- it's nice for 

you to say that. But tell me, having announced your 

theory, how the next step is avoidable? Under what 

theory would we say you can't have a discovery rule, but 

you can have a fraudulent concealment rule? 

MR. LIMAN: Your Honor, in the -- using the 

same type of theory and the same methodology that the

Court employed in the RICO context, in the Claire case, 

and in the Rotella case, one can read the statute, I 

think you have to read the statute, here to say that 

"accrue" means accrue. It's the time that the 

government can first sue. 

That does not necessarily resolve the 

question of whether there are equitable exceptions that 

the government or any party could affirmatively assert 

to toll the statute of limitations, not to delay the 

accrual of the statute of limitations. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. -- Mr. Liman, you 

acknowledge that a civil action could be brought 

beginning from the time when the injured plaintiff 

discovers the fraud, right? 

MR. LIMAN: That's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you're really not 

arguing for what you might call a total statute of 

repose. It seems to me odd that the defendant would be 

relieved from prosecution by the government, but not 

relieved from a suit for sometimes very substantial 

damages by -- by an injured plaintiff who doesn't have 

to sue until he's discovered the fraud. 

MR. LIMAN: Your Honor, respectfully, we 

don't think that's not odd at all. If you look in the 

securities context, there is a 5-year statute of repose.

And it would be odd to think that the same Congress that 

passed that 5-year statute of repose limiting even the 

ability of an injured plaintiff without the tools of the 

government to bring a private suit for damages, that's 

the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure. But that 5 years 

doesn't begin to run until the private plaintiff 

discovers the fraud, right? 

MR. LIMAN: That's -- that's not correct, 

Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No? 

MR. LIMAN: Under Title 28 1658(b) the 5 

years runs from the time of the violation. It's exactly 

coextensive with 2462, and it's not an accident that it's 

exactly coextensive. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Liman, how does it 

work with a disgorgement remedy? I take it that that's 

still -- that you are not challenging the disgorgement? 

MR. LIMAN: We are not challenging the 

disgorgement in front of this Court, and if this Court 

reverses the Second Circuit that -- that issue will 

remain in the case and the SEC's claim for disgorgement 

will remain, and that's really been the way --

MR. LIMAN: 2462 applies exclusively with 

respect to penalties, fines and forfeitures. It does 

not apply with respect to equitable remedies.

of limitations on disgorgement?

Security? Does it apply to Veterans Affairs?

Congress otherwise provided. In fact, there are very 

few penalty statutes to which it does not apply.

MR. LIMAN: It does apply to a number of 

Defense Department statutes. I'm hesitating --

JUSTICE BREYER: Antitrust? 

MR. LIMAN: I'm not sure on antitrust. But 

I believe that it applies to -- it does apply to a 

number of unfair trade practices. Antitrust, there may 

be a separate statute.

MR. LIMAN: FTC, yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: It does apply to FTC, okay. 

So Social Security, FTC. Veterans Affairs we don't 

know, antitrust we don't know. Okay. 

MR. LIMAN: One of the notable features, 

Justice Breyer, is that if you look across the U.S. 

Code, the government makes a point of saying: Well, 

Congress uses penalty -- acknowledges that Congress has 

used penalty when -- the word "penalty" when the 

Congress has -- I'm sorry, it has used the word 

"discovery" when Congress has wanted the statute to --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Liman, I'm a little

claimants who have -- under your theory, who have been 

directly injured. The presumption would apply of 

discovery, if they were claiming a fraud. 

MR. LIMAN: No -- no, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So are you just arguing 

that under this statutory scheme there is no application 

of the discovery? 

MR. LIMAN: This -- this Court has held in 

the Lampf case that Bailey and Holmberg do not apply to 

securities fraud case. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Because of the 

alternative language of 5 years. 

MR. LIMAN: Well, in Lampf it was 1-year and 

3-year. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Right. 

MR. LIMAN: And in the Merck case, the Court 

made clear that the 5 years was the statute of -- the 

statute of repose.

easily exist in other contexts because this isn't only a 

statute about securities violations. So that you might 

have in other contexts in which this statute applies a 

world in which a private individual could sue, but the 

government -- could sue after the -- the period of 

time --

MR. LIMAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- the 5 years, but the 

government could not. 

MR. LIMAN: Yes, Justice Kagan. And we 

don't think that's an anomaly. We don't think it's an 

anomaly for two reasons. First of all, in the private 

context, as again I mentioned, the statute, the start 

date for the statute of limitations is not in the 

control of the plaintiff. That's a critical point. 

It's critical in this Court's jurisprudence from Hubrick 

forward. It -- there is a natural start date from when 

the injury would be known to a reasonable plaintiff. 

Not true with respect to the government, who may not 

even know of the transaction. And -- but what it -- so 

it's -- I don't think there's an anomaly because there 

are different statutes of limitation. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: And I take it that your view 

would be that a case like Exploration, it's different 

than this case because it does have a natural start

date; is that the idea? 

MR. LIMAN: Number one, it does. And number 

two, the relief being sought in Exploration was the 

cancellation of a patent, so it was the government as a 

party to a transaction. And what the Court really said 

in Exploration, what the Court, in fact, said in 

Exploration, is that there is no reason why the same 

rule applied the same way couldn't benefit the 

government, as well as the private plaintiff. 

What the government is seeking here is not 

the same rule and would not be applied in the same way 

because you are talking about a transaction that is a, 

frankly, a private transaction that there is no reason 

that the government would know anything about. The 

claim ultimately here is a claim about what was said in 

a private conversation between the advisor to a mutual 

fund and the mutual fund -- fund board. 

So Exploration, what's notable is that the 

government doesn't cite a single case where the 

discovery rule has been applied to a party who is not a 

victim or that it's been applied -- where it's been 

applied and a penalty hasn't been -- a penalty has been 

at issue. I mean, neither of those circumstances. We 

are talking about a statute ultimately where the plain 

language is clear and the government is invoking a

statutory canon not to try to interpret language of the 

statute, not even to fill a gap in a statute, but to 

override it. The canon that they say overrides the 

plain language doesn't exist. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In a civil -- in a civil 

action brought by an injured investor or private party, 

can that plaintiff, the injured investor, the private 

party, in the ordinary course plead and rely upon an 

earlier government determination that there had been a 

violation and so that that's presumptive showing of 

liability? 

MR. LIMAN: Your Honor --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, the SEC 

makes an investigation, finds a violation; can a private 

investor then rely on that as a presumptive showing of 

liability? 

MR. LIMAN: Yeah. I think the lower courts 

are mixed on the extent to which you can rely upon the 

actual allegations in a complaint. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, not the allegation. 

It's an ultimate finding. 

MR. LIMAN: Absolutely.

Your Honor. Under our rule the plaintiff has exactly 

the same rights, regardless of how this case is 

determined. The plaintiff's cause of action will turn 

upon the underlying --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if the government's 

statute of limitations runs out and the private investor 

is on his own, then the private investor doesn't have 

the advantage that exists in other cases of reliance on 

a -- SEC finding as a presumptive showing of liability. 

MR. LIMAN: Your Honor, that -- that -- our 

argument only applies with respect to penalty. The 

government has huge powers with respect to disgorgement 

and injunctive relief. So, if the government believes 

that there is a wrongdoing, the government still has the 

ability to bring a claim and the private investors still 

have the ability to rely upon the government's 

enforcement action and whatever findings come out of 

that. So there is nothing in our argument that 

diminished, to any degree, the recovery abilities of a 

private plaintiff. 

In fact, as we've highlighted, that 5-year 

period for the -- in the securities laws puts a premium 

on the SEC acting promptly. And I would note that 

that's something that is not accidental. If you go back 

in the legislative history and look to the SEC's

reaction to the Lampf decision, the SEC urged a 5-year 

statute of repose, saying that that struck in the 

private context the right balance between repose when 

you're dealing with complex commercial transactions and 

enforcement and -- and recovery. 

There's -- the position that the SEC is 

taking now is a novel position that to -- to our 

knowledge has not been taken by other regulators and 

hasn't been taken by the SEC until -- until quite 

recently. This statute's been on the books for quite a 

long time, and it's notable that agencies have not urged 

that -- that interpretation.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are there no statutes

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court: 

I think Justice Kennedy started us off in 

the right place by focusing on the statute and its use 

of the term "accrual." And when counsel concedes that 

that term had an established meaning at common law and 

this statute picks it up, I think he gave away his case 

because there were a cluster of concepts. One was the 

general rule governing accrual: It accrues when the 

plaintiff can -- has a right to sue. 

But there was a specific principle for cases 

of fraud and concealment. And I don't think there is 

any basis in law or logic for Petitioner saying that 

this statute meant to pick up one of those concepts and 

not the other concept. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think the common 

law held that it didn't accrue. I think it was an

exception to the accrual rule, that, even though it 

accrued earlier, we are going to allow a later suit 

where -- where discovery is made later. I -- is that 

the way those cases were framed, that it didn't accrue 

until discovery? 

MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, I don't want to 

fight about it too much because from the government's 

perspective, it doesn't matter --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you are making the 

argument, so you ought to fight about it. 

MR. WALL: It doesn't matter how it's 

labeled. It doesn't matter whether we label it as an 

interpretation of the statute or an exception for cases 

of fraud or concealment. The result is the same. 

But I will say you are right, in some cases 

it was described as an exception, but as long ago as 

Kirby in 1887 and as recently as Merck --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And never in a criminal 

case, right? Do you have a single case in which the 

discovery rule was -- was applied in a criminal case 

with respect to a penalty or a criminal sanction? 

MR. WALL: No, not in --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Not a single one. 

MR. WALL: Well, no. The criminal context 

is fundamentally different. This Court has said that

those statutes are construed liberally in favor of 

repose and are presumptively not subject to --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, that's the question 

because I certainly agree with Justice Scalia that this 

is not an SEC statute, this is not a securities statute; 

it is a statute that applies to all government actions, 

which is a huge category across the board and it's about 

200 years old. 

And until 2004 I haven't found a single case 

in which the government ever tried to assert the 

discovery rule where what they were seeking was a civil 

penalty, not to try to make themselves whole where they 

are a victim, with one exception, a case called Maillard 

in the 19th century where they did make that assertion. 

They were struck down by the district court, and the 

attorney general in his opinion said, the district 

court's absolutely right; of course, the government 

cannot effectively abolish the statute of limitations 

where what they're trying to do is to gather something 

that's so close to a criminal case. 

So my question is: Is there any case at all 

until the year 2004, approximately, in which the 

government has either tried or certainly succeeded in 

taking this general statute and applying the discovery 

rule where they are not a victim, they are trying to

The reason I brought up Social Security, 

Veteran's Affairs, Medicare, is it seems to me to have 

enormous consequences for the government suddenly to try 

to assert a quasi-criminal penalty and abolish the 

statute of limitations, I mean, in a vast set of cases. 

And that -- you know, I have overstated that last remark 

a little bit, but I want you to see where I'm coming 

from, which isn't so different from the -- from the 

questions that have been put to you. 

MR. WALL: Justice Breyer, most or many of 

the penalty claims that are being brought under Section 

2462 and other penalty statutes don't deal with fraud or 

concealment, and I grant you that it is a problem --

JUSTICE BREYER: All I'm asking you for is 

one case. 

MR. WALL: So in -- it's a problem of fairly 

recent vintage, to be sure --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, it is not a problem of 

fairly recent vintage. I'd say for 200 years there is 

no case. The only case, as far as I have been able to 

discover, which is why I am asking, is that what created 

the problem of recent vintage is that the Seventh 

Circuit, I guess, or a couple of other circuits decided 

that this discovery rule did apply to an effort by the

government to assert a civil penalty. That's what 

created the problem. Before that there was no problem; 

it was clear the government couldn't do it. 

All right. Now, you will tell me that I'm 

wrong by citing some cases that show I'm wrong. And 

that's what I'm asking. I want to be told I'm wrong, 

sort of. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. WALL: And I guess what I want to tell 

you is there aren't cases out there one way or the 

other. There aren't cases endorsing or declining to 

adopt the discovery rule in the context of fraud or 

concealment with civil penalty actions --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You'd expect that - you'd 

expect there to be some cases in a couple of hundred 

years. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I haven't found one. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Fraud is nothing new, for 

Pete's sake. 

MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, it's not that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: This is brand-new assertion 

by the government that -- tell -- is there much 

difference between the rule you are arguing for and a 

rule that there is no statute of limitations?

look, in 1990 the Commission was given the right to seek 

civil penalties, so it could only have brought these 

actions for the last 20 years. In those 20-plus years, 

we have seen 25 reported cases dealing with 2462 and 

civil penalties. In 19 of those cases, the Commission 

brought its action within 5 years of the end of the 

fraud. It used the discovery rule only to reach back 

and get the beginning of the fraud. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that 

ignores the point that has been raised, is that this 

statute does not just apply in the SEC context. How 

many cases have you found across the board in the range 

of those areas that Justice Breyer catalogued? 

MR. WALL: There are cases from the 1980s 

and 1990s dealing with concealment, and in our view the 

justification is the same for concealment as fraud. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, we are asking the 

same question, but in 30 seconds I am going to conclude 

there is none. What I want is a case before the year 

2000 in which the government sought a civil penalty and 

was not trying to recover money or land that it had 

lost, and I want the name of that case in which they 

said that the discovery rule applies.

injured by losing land or losing money, something like 

that. So I have those and I don't think they count, but 

I will look at them again. Is there anything else you 

would like to refer me to? 

MR. WALL: Justice Breyer, I don't think 

there is anything on either side of the ledger, I will 

be very upfront, other than the Maillard case, which I 

think even courts at the time, an exploration company, 

the court of appeals recognized --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not a matter of there 

being nothing on either side of the ledger. What's 

extraordinary is that the government has never asserted 

this, except in the 19th century, when it was rebuffed 

and -- and repudiated its position. It isn't just that 

there are no cases against you. It's you've never --

the government has never asserted it before. 

MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, there were very 

few civil penalty actions in which -- that involved 

fraud or concealment, in which the government would have 

needed to invoke it, or did invoke it and was rebuffed 

by courts. I mean, this is a fairly modern problem, and 

the question is do all of the same concepts that 

compelled one answer in these other contexts compel the 

same answer here or does a rule that blankets the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, this is a very 

modern problem, but how about the statute of Elizabeth, 

which talked about penalties as being a criminal 

sanction, but permitted private individuals, not the 

government, to seek the penalties and keep it. So you 

cite the statute of James, and I look at the statute of 

Elizabeth, and try to find the analogy between which 

one. 

MR. WALL: Well, if this were a criminal 

penalty, the government agrees --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Even though private 

parties could keep the money back then. 

MR. WALL: That's right. But what the 

Court's been clear on is that there are civil penalties 

and there are criminal penalties and which side of the 

line it falls on invokes a different set of background 

rules and legal norms. The Congress denominated this as 

a civil penalty --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I move you to 

another issue? If a party can defeat the government's 

claim of discovery by showing that the government wasn't 

reasonably diligent, how does a party ever accomplish 

that? Aren't you going to raise the law enforcement 

privilege, the -- some other privilege to block --

discovery?

MR. WALL: Justice Sotomayor, discovery is 

playing itself out in cases like these in district 

courts. Privilege has not been a very major issue and 

the reason is defendants are by and large pointing to 

things in the public domain -- private lawsuits, public 

filings with the Commission, public statements -- to say 

those put the Commission on constructive words --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, if they fail 

there, don't you think that they are going to also fail 

because they are not going to be able to look at your 

records to figure out exactly what you knew or didn't 

know? 

MR. WALL: No, not invariably. I mean, the 

way this plays itself out in the district court is the 

Commission says that it didn't know and a defendant 

points to something in the public domain and says either 

that put you on constructive notice or --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it depends really 

on how many enforcement officers the SEC has, is it 

reasonable for them to have been aware of the particular 

item in some publication. Maybe if they've got 1,000 

people reviewing it, but maybe not if they have 10; and 

that's just not the -- I mean, it's not just the SEC; 

it's all these other government areas.

impossible for somebody to prove that the government 

should have known about something. And which part of 

the government? I mean, it's a big, big government, and 

particular agencies -- well, you say, well, the Defense 

Contractor Board should have known, but does that mean 

that the U.S. attorney's office or the Defense Counsel's 

office should have known? 

It seems to me that, at least with respect 

to that aspect, you really are eliminating any real --

it's certainly not a lot of repose if the idea is, well, 

I've got to establish that this particular government 

agency should have known about this. 

You certainly can't sit back and say, well,

3 discussing whether or not a government agency has been

You see, in the private context we have some sense of 

6 what the plaintiff has to do to protect the plaintiff's 

7 rights. He has to be diligent. But to transpose that 

8 to a governmental agency -- suppose the agency's over --

9 overworked or underfunded? I don't -- which way do you 

come out when the government says that? 

11  MR. WALL: Justice Kennedy, not just this 

12 statute. There are other statutes, the False Claims Act 

13 and others, that have specific provisions requiring 

14 courts to determine when a government official would 

reasonably have been on notice of certain circumstances.

have reasonably been discovered by a government agency if 

21 it had more resources, but given the resources that it had

might be circumstances where the Commission would be on 

constructive notice and not a private plaintiff because 

of its expertise. It would see something in the public 

domain that should be meaningful to it that might not be 

meaningful to a private plaintiff --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The False Claims Act 

example you give is indeed a private plaintiff kind of a 

case. 

MR. WALL: That's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, you can say the 

government, having been cheated, should have known it 

was cheated. But we are talking here about prosecution, 

essentially, prosecution for a civil penalty rather than 

a criminal. By the way, doesn't the rule of lenity 

apply whether the penalty is criminal or civil? So if I 

think the word "accrual" is, at best, ambiguous, 

shouldn't the tie go to the defendant? 

MR. WALL: No. The court's been very -- I 

mean, in all of the civil cases applying the fraud 

discovery rule, the court has never looked to the 

criminal analogies. The canon here is that ambiguities 

get construed for the sovereign, not against it. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But my question is broader 

than that. Does the rule of lenity not apply to all 

penalties?

MR. WALL: I can't say that I focused on it 

specifically, but I think if the Petitioner said --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it's an important 

issue in this case, surely. I mean, if "accrual" is 

ambiguous and we have a rule of lenity, we should 

interpret it to favor the defendant. 

MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, I don't --

Petitioner certainly couldn't claim that this civil 

penalty should have to be proved beyond a reasonable 

doubt, or that they are entitled to a constitutional 

right to counsel. I don't know why one legal norm among 

them all should change in the civil context and not the 

others. 

JUSTICE BREYER: The reason would be that 

the -- you know, once you start talking about applying 

this to Social Security, for example, or to Medicare, 

for example, or to DOD, for example, you have somebody 

who did commit some fraud and they kept the money. You 

know, she had five children not four, or she has five, 

not six. And I can understand it being fair when the

say, We want our money back. Okay. I say that's fair, 

not necessarily merciful, but fair. 

But then to go and say, and in addition we 

want this civil penalty, even though -- of course, we 

couldn't have discovered it. Don't you know there are 4 

million people who get Social Security or 40 million or 

something, and we can't police every one. And so 

suddenly, I see I am opening the door, not just to 

getting your money back, but to also you're having what 

looked like criminal penalties years later without much 

benefit of a statute of limitations. 

That is at the back of my mind. And I'd 

like to know, having brought it up front, what -- what 

your response is. 

MR. WALL: Absolutely. There are anomalies 

on both sides of the coin and I just want to touch on 

both very briefly. Take the example you gave. In that 

situation, the defendant's fraud or concealment 

would allow it or him to escape paying civil penalties, 

but not private damages.

if there's a private right of action, the private 

6 plaintiff will be able to recover damages and the

9 people who are hurt, where two people have been hurt. 

For example, I wrote the case in Burk and we had the 

11 statute of limitations and Congress focused on this. 

12 And it wrote a two-tier statute. And it wrote a 

13 two-tier statute in large part because it was concerned 

14 about the problem you mention. You have a victim. So 

you're either going to let the defendant keep the money 

16 or the victim gets it back. I understand that, but this 

17 is not that context. This is like a criminal context, 

18 where not only are you getting your money back, but you 

19 also want to assess a kind of criminal penalty. And in 

that situation, I see a pretty clear line and I don't 

21 understand why the government is so anxious to change

fraud and you can't put them in jail either, but you can 

get your money back. 

MR. WALL: But the reason there's no private 

right of action in those contexts is, in part, because 

government agencies can seek civil penalties. And I 

cannot imagine that the Congress, which allowed agencies 

to seek civil penalties, where here they had existing 

remedies, would have thought that the only people who 

could get away without paying them are the ones who 

commit fraud or concealment and that remains hidden for 

five years. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And the reason --

the reason there's no private action -- right of action 

is not because the government could seek civil 

penalties, it's because Congress hasn't provided a 

private right of action. 

MR. WALL: That's right because it thought 

that the agencies could seek civil penalties and that 

was sufficient.

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh, no, your case--

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it didn't -- it 

didn't necessarily think, and that's why we have a case, 

that they could seek civil penalties 10 years later, 

18 years later, however long, so long as they were busy 

doing other things and didn't have a chance to know. 

MR. WALL: No question. And in the average 

typical case, the time that Congress afforded is enough 

and we're not here claiming any different, but that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it is a generous 

period. It's -- it's 5 years. And, Mr. Wall, maybe you 

can explain the SEC's pursuit of this -- of this case. 

The alleged fraud went on from 1999 to 2002. It was 

discovered in 2003. The SEC waited from 2003 to 2008 to 

commence suit. What -- what is the reason for -- for 

the delay from the time of discovery till the time suit 

is instituted? 

MR. WALL: Justice Ginsburg, there was a lot 

of back and forth between the parties, document 

exchanges, they wanted to make additional submissions. 

The government hoped that there would be a settlement 

that would encompass all the defendants. Ultimately, 

there was a settlement that only went to the fund and 

Petitioners did not settle and then the government put 

together and brought its case.

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Wall, I'll go even 

further than Justice Ginsburg. I mean this case actually 

seems to me a good example when Mr. Liman said there's 

no natural starting point and Justice Kennedy and 

Justice Alito referred to just -- this is a -- this is a 

decision about enforcement priorities. The government 

had decided not to go after market timers. And it 

changed its decision when a State attorney general 

decided to do it, and it embarrassed them that they had 

made that enforcement priority decision, and then the 

government made a different enforcement priority 

decision. But that's not the kind of situation that the 

discovery rule was intended to operate on, is it? 

MR. WALL: Justice Kagan, I don't think 

that's fair. We didn't go -- it wasn't market timing 

that we discovered. What General Spitzer announced was 

there are advisors that are permitting market timing, 

but misleading investors about it and they're doing it 

in return for investments in other funds that they 

manage, what are called sticky asset agreements, and 

then we started doing market sweeps for those 

agreements. 

And I don't think we can ignore the evidence 

here because we shouldn't decide the case based on 

feverish hypotheticals. There are 25 reported cases

brought by the Commission involving this statute, 19 

were brought within 5 years and they were just reaching 

back to pick up the beginning of the fraud. And the 

other six, including this case, the longest lag time was 

six and a half years from the end of the fraud to 

bringing the complaint. 

And the reason is these are dynamic markets. 

There's a lot going on in the public domain that puts 

the commission on notice, inquiry or constructive, and 

starts the clock running. Not only have we not seen a 

10, a 15, a 20-year case, we haven't seen a 7-year case. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, if all that's true, 

and this is a point I want you to -- I'm not sure I am 

right about this point, but remember your banking case 

now, we're sounding like that, I thought -- doesn't the 

doctrine of fraudulent concealment still apply? That 

is, if the defendant, in fact, takes any affirmative 

action to hide what's going on, the statute will be 

tolled. Is that right? 

MR. WALL: That's right, but that --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. As long as 

that's right, then in all your banking cases, there are 

bank inspectors all over these banks, I hope -- you 

know, about once a month or so --

the chance of there -- the chance of this somehow 

escaping notice without fraudulent concealment, which 

would allow the government to extend the toll strikes me 

as small, but am I right? 

MR. WALL: Justice Breyer, I want to be 

clear. In the government's view, the concealment would 

apply, though Petitioners or others like them will be 

back here making exactly the same arguments. The 

government's point is just at equity fraud and 

concealment were a pair and the justification was the 

same for both. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, perhaps I've missed 

something. I -- I came in here thinking that both 

parties were willing to concede for purposes of this 

case that there was a fraudulent concealment. Is 

that -- is that wrong? 

MR. WALL: I -- I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, for purposes of 

presenting the statute of limitations issue that's 

before us. 

MR. WALL: I don't think the Petitioners are 

disputing it here, but I think Mr. Liman acknowledged 

earlier that, if pressed, his arguments could be 

leveraged to get rid of the concealment doctrine, too.

I'm sorry, Justice Scalia. I wasn't trying to mislead. 

This is not a concealment case. This is a fraud case. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought it was the 

opposite. In other words, I thought both parties, for 

purposes of this argument, are assuming fraudulent 

concealment has nothing to do with it. We are not to 

consider fraudulent concealment. 

MR. WALL: This is a fraud case, not a 

concealment case. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Am I right when I say that? 

MR. WALL: Yes. I was just trying to say 

that once you say there is a concealment exception, the 

fraud exception follows from equity because they were of 

a piece. And once you say there is not a fraud 

exception, the same arguments will be leveraged to get 

rid of a concealment exception. And the reason that 

equity treated them as -- of a piece was the deception 

was the same. The fraud was self-concealing or even if 

it was non-fraud, the defendant could conceal, but 

either way -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that concealment is 

sort -- you know, it's sort of a self-starter. You --

you -- it -- it doesn't apply always. It applies when 

there is concealment, and the person who is being 

subjected to the longer statute of limitations is on 

notice that if he fraudulently conceals, he's extending 

the statute. So I -- I don't think that the one has to 

go with the other. Maybe they're both equitable 

doctrines, but that doesn't -- that doesn't mean that we 

have to apply them to this statute. 

MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, for 300 years, 

English and American courts looking at this problem have 

said where the defendant's misconduct, be it fraud or be 

it concealment of a non-fraud, but where the defendant's 

deception prevents a plaintiff from knowing that he, she 

or it has a cause of action, equity suspends the running 

of a statute of limitations. Those -- that has been --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And for 300 years, that has 

been said only with respect to civil actions, not with 

respect to the government's attempt to exact a penalty. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's correct.

action. I don't think even Petitioners are disputing

same ground, but I don't know that you have -- I mean, 

I'm worried about your giving up the fraudulent 

concealment. I mean, you wouldn't give up equitable 

estoppel, would you? 

MR. WALL: If I gave up anything on 

fraudulent concealment, I didn't mean to. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. I mean -- I 

mean, there's nothing --

(Laughter.) 

MR. WALL: I want to be very clear, I give 

up nothing.

equitable -- equitable tolling doesn't apply, nothing in

fraudulent concealment, but I don't know about the other 

two.

about what I did, but by the way, I won't assert a 

statute of limitations defense, I promise. And the 

Court says, hey, you just asserted one, you can't. 

MR. WALL: Justice Breyer, Petitioners in a 

future case would be back here saying: The text of the 

statute says nothing about equitable estoppel. And even 

if you've applied it to everybody else's actions, you 

can't apply it to me because I'm somehow different. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And you will say nonsense 

in that future case, won't you? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. WALL: That's -- I'll be as right then 

as I am now.

MR. WALL: I mean, Petitioners' argument has 

this sort air of unreality. You've applied it 

everywhere else he says, but not to me. Think how odd 

that is, Justice Scalia, that where you have a 

background canon that says ambiguities get construed 

for, and not against, the sovereign. When the sovereign

somehow a subordinate interest and the sovereign alone 

cannot take advantage of the Fraud Discovery Rule. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Wall, why is it that you 

don't you have any cases? I mean, you said way back 

when: This didn't come up, this is a modern problem. 

So explain to me why this is a modern problem. This is 

obviously an old statute. Are you saying that this 

statute has not been used very -- was not used very much 

until very, very recently? 

MR. WALL: There are -- that's right. There 

are very few cases that deal with this statute at all 

and, obviously, in this context because the Commission's 

only had the ability to bring civil penalties for about 

20 years. 

But I think that is not a problem unknown to 

the law. Again and again, facing garden variety 

limitations provisions written just like this one, this 

Court applied the fraud discovery rule. And now they 

come in and say, oh, but you've never applied it to this 

statute. That's true, but everything about this statute 

is identical as a matter of text and history to the 

statute of Bailey. 

The cause of action equally accrued there, 

and this Court's applied it across bankruptcy, land,

JUSTICE KAGAN: But what you're running up 

against is a skepticism, that -- you know, the 

government, which has not -- asserted this power for 200 

years, is now coming in and saying we want it. And 

the question is why hasn't the government asserted this 

power previously? 

MR. WALL: I -- there are just very few 

cases on it. I think there are very few civil penalty 

actions that are being brought at all, certainly to 

which this statute apply, and certainly that deal with 

fraud or concealment and reach outside the 5-year 

period. And I don't have a great answer for why there 

aren't cases. All I can tell you is that -- it isn't 

like there are cases rejecting our arguments. We just 

see an absence of case law. 

But what we do see are -- is cases like 

Exploration Company, where the government comes in, is 

really suing in a sovereign capacity, to redistribute 

land from some private land owners to another by 

annulling their patents. And this Court rejects 

basically exactly the same arguments Petitioners are 

making and says it applies equally to the government 

when it brings an action as to private plaintiffs. 

Now, an action for civil penalties? No, the 

relief here is a little different, but if one looks back

at the briefs the arguments are exactly the same. They 

made exactly the same claims that the sky was falling 

there, and for 100 years they have not been true. There 

is nothing important about this statute as a matter of 

text, structure or anything else from the other statutes 

to which this Court has again and again applied the 

rule. And the justification is the same. It's the 

defendant's misconduct which keeps the plaintiff from 

knowing of her cause of action. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you made 

the point earlier that it would be very odd that it's 

only the sovereign that doesn't benefit from the 

discovery rule when other people can. But it's when 

it's the sovereign that's bringing the action that the 

concerns about repose are particularly presented. You 

know, the sovereign, with all of its resources, can 

decide to go after whomever it discovers, however many 

years after -- whether it's the Social Security 

recipient that Justice Breyer mentioned or -- or anyone 

else. 

So I at least don't find it unusual that 

it's the sovereign in particular that doesn't get the 

benefit of whenever you happen to find about it rule.

but what equity has always said is in cases of fraud or

concealment the defendant is not entitled to repose 

until there is discovery of the fraud. And equity has 

never looked at the identity of the plaintiff, the 

elements of the cause of action, the plaintiff's status, 

role, party to what happened in the case. That is 

never --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would you agree that 

when we're talking about the interests in repose that 

the one plaintiff we should be particularly 

concerned about is the government? 

MR. WALL: I -- I don't think that there's a 

basis for separating as between private damages lawsuits 

and civil penalties. I think when Congress sets a 

statute of limitations, that's a limitation on the 

various forms of --

penalties? Would your argument be different with regard 

to criminal? 

MR. WALL: Justice Scalia --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Incidentally, what makes 

something a civil penalty? You just call it a civil 

penalty and -- and you don't have to prove it beyond a 

reasonable doubt, and you get the benefit of this 

extension that you are arguing for?

important things. Yes, our argument would absolutely be 

different in a criminal context. In cases like Marion 

and Toussie, this Court has explained how statutes of 

limitations function in the criminal context is very 

different. They are presumptively not equitably tolled, 

whereas civil statutes are presumptively equitably 

tolled. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What makes -- what makes a 

penalty a civil penalty? 

MR. WALL: In Hudson v. United States --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, a penalty is a 

penalty as far as I'm concerned if the government's 

taking money from me. 

MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, the Court walked 

through in Hudson v. United States the test for 

denominating a civil from a criminal penalty. The main 

thing is what Congress denominates it, although you can 

look behind that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's nice. 

MR. WALL: Here, there is no question that 

this is a civil penalty. It was denominated by Congress 

that way, it functions that way, it is phrased that way. 

I think even Petitioners and all of their amici -- not a 

single person on that side of the case has attempted to

Hudson. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That isn't my point, that 

it is criminal. My point is, it doesn't seem to me to 

make a whole lot of difference as far as these issues 

are concerned. 

MR. WALL: Justice Scalia, the Court has 

always said that whether the penalty is civil or 

criminal carries with it a different set of legal rules 

or norms, and no party has ever successfully come into 

court and said, well, it may be civil, but it's a little 

criminal-like, so I should borrow from the criminal 

context. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What about the --

what about the Halper case? 

MR. WALL: Mr. Chief Justice, I think Hudson 

overruled Halper in large part, and no one here has 

asked this Court to label this a criminal penalty. They 

have asked the Court to call this a civil penalty and 

yet say the fraud discovery rule does not apply. That, 

there is no precedent for.

First of all, with respect to whether this 

is a criminal penalty and whether the rules of lenity 

apply, this Court has held in the Commissioner v. 

Ackerly case that the rule of lenity applies to civil 

penalties. 

Just as an --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. What 

case? 

MR. LIMAN: I believe it's Commissioner 

against Ackerly. It's cited in one of the -- one of the 

amicus briefs. 

Second, the concession that you just heard a 

moment ago, that the statute would not apply as the 

government says it should apply if this was deemed to be 

a criminal penalty, we submit under this Court's 

reasoning in Clark v. Martinez, it just gave away the 

store in the government's case because if it is 

possible -- as the government has now admitted it's 

possible -- and I don't want to get into all of the 

permutations of Hudson -- but if it is possible that the 

label of civil penalty does not -- is not dispositive as 

to whether a penalty is civil or criminal, then, as the 

Court held in Clark v. Martinez, the lowest common 

denominator applies. 

One has to interpret this statute so that it

is applicable across the range of statutes. And if 

that's so, then it follows, it runs from accrual as that 

word is commonly understood. 

Next point. The government said that there 

are no cases where the Court considered the -- the claim 

that it is making. We would point the Court's attention 

to the Rotella case, in which in the context of a 

private plaintiff, who did not have the resources of the 

government, the argument was made that the RICO statute 

should have a discovery of the violation-type principle. 

And the argument was made there that RICO 

can encompass a pattern of fraudulent acts. And the 

plaintiff in that case said, as the government says 

here, fraud can be concealed, can be complex, can be 

difficult to discover. 

And the Court unanimously had a response to 

that. The response was that, at least as soon as you 

know the injury, where there is an injury element, the 

difficulty of discovery of the actual violation doesn't 

defer the running of the statute of limitations. It 

would defeat the purposes of a statute of limitations. 

The government also argued that the problems 

of privilege are not significant ones. We would point 

the Court's attention to the Joint Appendix in the 

Second Circuit, where the government asserted privilege

with respect to our questions about its investigations 

of the counterparty to this alleged quid -- quid pro 

quo. 

The Court also asked a question of whether 

there are any cases in which courts have dealt with 

government agencies being diligent, and the claim being 

the government agency was not diligent. The Court has 

dealt with that in a related context, in the 

Heckler v. Cheney context. And in the Heckler v. Cheney 

context the Court held that type of issue, how an 

administrative agency treats facts that are -- that it 

discovers and whether it chooses to bring a claim or 

not, whether it chooses to believe that they are in 

violation of a statute, the agency is charged with 

administering is not fit for judicial review. No 

different result should apply here. 

Just two more points. The False Claims Act 

has a -- which has an explicit discovery rule, also has 

a statute of repose. It would be very odd, indeed, if 

the one circumstance where Congress, one of the few 

circumstances where Congress chose to use the word 

"discovery," was where the government was injured, and 

they -- Congress chose to impose a statute of repose, 

where, as they say in the 100 or other statutes that use

to be discovery and no repose. 

And that really ties into the last point, 

which is that there are, by our count, if you look at

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:14 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
