3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4 first today in Case 07-552, Sprint Communications

5 Company v. APCC Services, Inc.

6 Mr. Phillips.

7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9             MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10 and may it please the Court:

11             Chief Judge Sentelle observed in his dissent

12 below that there are assignments and there are

13 assignments, and that's essentially going to be the

14 theme of my presentation this morning.  It is I think

15 common ground between the parties in this litigation

16 that if you have an assignment which represents the

17 grant of the entirety of both the right and the remedy,

18 that is the complete assignment of the chosen action,

19 then under those circumstances there's no question that

20 the assignee has standing under Article III.

21             By parity of receiving, if all that the

22 assignee receives is a power of attorney, a mere

23 collection agency role, under those circumstances I

24 think it's common ground between the parties that

25 Article III is not satisfied.  Two of the data points



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

4

1 come from --

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Say it again?  What is the

3 common ground?

4             MR. PHILLIPS:  I think the second part of

5 the common ground is that if all that the assignee

6 receives is the power of attorney, that is to serve as

7 the lawyer for the assignor, under those circumstances

8 the assignee doesn't -- cannot -- has no common stake

9 than I or my clients do in these particular cases, any

10 more than I do in my client's interest in these

11 particular cases, and there I don't think anybody

12 disputes that Article III is not satisfied.

13             Now, the Court in Vermont Agency sort of

14 identified two additional data points.  First of all, it

15 made clear that a 10 percent bounty by itself unattached

16 to anything else is not sufficient, largely I think for

17 the same reasons why the lawyer's claim is insufficient,

18 because that's not tied to the particular right at stake

19 and therefore is inadequate to allow Article III to the

20 satisfied.

21             The second half of it is, though, that if

22 that bounty is coupled with an assignment of the rights

23 and even if that's a partial assignment of the rights,

24 then there is Article III jurisdiction under those

25 circumstances.

1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So that if these

2 contracts provided that the aggregators will turn over

3 all of the proceeds of the litigation except for one

4 penny, then you'd be satisfied?

5             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I'm not sure I'd be

6 satisfied.  I think there's a different -- I think the

7 answer is that might satisfy Article III.  The only

8 reason I'm reluctant to say that that's the line that

9 ought to be drawn is because this Court's taxpayer

10 standing cases seems to recognize that there are

11 situations where there is a sufficiently de minimis

12 amount of at stake that under those circumstances

13 Article III won't be satisfied.  But clearly the

14 cleanest line to draw is in circumstances where have you

15 no stake in the outcome that clearly is beyond what

16 Article III would ultimately do.

17             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well then, this is not

18 really a very significant case, is it?  Because I

19 presume that these enterprises that agglomerate claims

20 and bring suit as a collection agency, they could simply

21 get their compensation, instead of by way of, of a flat

22 fee, by, you know, claiming entitlement to 2 percent of

23 the rewards.  So it's no big deal, I mean, really.

24             MR. PHILLIPS:  But it is a big deal, not

25 necessarily because of the importance of the article.  I



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

6

1 think the Article III part of it is still a big deal.  I

2 think requiring as a separation of powers matter that

3 there has to be a concrete stake in the party bringing

4 the litigation, that's an important principle and the

5 Court shouldn't abandon it, and that's posed directly in

6 this case.

7             But more fundamentally in terms of the

8 importance of the underlying process, remember here

9 we're talking about an assignee who takes on 1400

10 different assignor claims involving 400,000 pay phones.

11 And that's the problem, is that when you break this down

12 and you allow just simple assignments to satisfy Article

13 III in its prudential standing concerns, then what you

14 end up with is this mass tort litigation.

15             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But it would be just the

16 same, Mr. Phillips, would it not, if the arrangement was

17 that the aggregator gets a piece of the action?  Let's

18 take out the de minimis one cent.  A significant stake,

19 like the qui tam plaintiff has.  So you would have the

20 same problems that you're complaining about with regard

21 to discovery from the individual PSPs, the same problem

22 with respect to counterclaim.

23             That's -- so it seems to me that, as Justice

24 Scalia suggested, this isn't about a whole lot if just

25 by the device of giving the aggregator part of the, a



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

7

1 piece of the action, this suit would be okay because the

2 prudential objections that you are making here would

3 apply just as well.

4             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, and I would -- I would

5 still assert those same prudential objections in the

6 hypothetical you pose.  What I'm saying is when you --

7 when you have an assignment and there is a bounty built

8 into it, however you want to define the bounty, whether

9 it's a penny or 10 percent or 2 percent or whatever,

10 that may satisfy Article III.  I understand that.  That

11 does not answer the question of whether there's

12 prudential standing under those circumstances.  In that

13 --

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Go ahead, I'm sorry.

15             MR. PHILLIPS:  In that context, Justice

16 Ginsburg, you do have the problems.  You don't get the

17 discovery.  You don't get to use the efficiency of the

18 counterclaim process, and there are serious questions

19 about whether or not there are res judicata and

20 collateral estoppel effects, and I would argue in that

21 context that there's a very significant claim that those

22 proceedings ought not to be entertained by a Federal

23 court as a prudential matter, not as a matter of Article

24 III.

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What if all of the



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

8

1 claimants assign their claims to something called an

2 agglomeration trust and the -- the person who's bringing

3 suit here brings it as a trustee?  He has no interest in

4 it personally and he is compensated the same way, the

5 same way this agglomerator is compensated.  He has no

6 personal interest.  He could sue, couldn't he?

7             MR. PHILLIPS:  I mean, there is a long

8 tradition of allowing trustees to bring litigation on

9 behalf of the trust because that's the only way that a

10 trust can in fact enforce its rights.

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  So once again, it's no big

12 deal.  I mean --

13             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it is a big deal,

14 because trust relationships carry all kinds of

15 additional legal consequences.  What is particularly

16 offensive about this arrangement, Your Honors, is that

17 the assignor gets all of the benefits of being able to

18 bring mass tort litigation with none of the

19 responsibilities.

20             JUSTICE SOUTER:  He would do the same thing

21 in Justice Scalia's if it were an irrevocable trust.

22 The trust could do exactly what the aggregator is doing

23 here.

24             MR. PHILLIPS:  That's true, but there are

25 additional trust responsibilities that would attach to



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

9

1 that process.  There's an entire legal regime to deal

2 with that.

3             JUSTICE SOUTER:  -- that might protect those

4 who assigned their interest to the trust, but I don't

5 offhand see what difference it would make, what

6 difference those responsibilities would make vis a vis

7 you and your client.

8             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, again, Justice Souter,

9 I think the answer probably is going to depend on how

10 the Court interprets the prudential standing doctrine.

11 Again, I don't have any quarrel as an Article III

12 matter, because I think it's one of those long-held

13 traditions that trustees are allowed to bring litigation

14 on behalf of the trust and that's understood.

15             JUSTICE SOUTER:  But the real issue is not

16 whether the trustee can sue.  The real issue is whether

17 the trust can sue.

18             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  I mean, that's where

19 the claims are, sure.

20             JUSTICE SOUTER:  It seems to me in his

21 example if the trust can sue, why can't the aggregator

22 sue?  And your answer was, well, trustees have certain

23 responsibilities.  But I don't see that those

24 responsibilities inure to the benefit of your client or

25 to an opposing party in litigation that a trust brings.

1 So I don't see how it would differentiate it.

2             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, there are two

3 differentiations.  One is that there is this entire

4 legal regime that regulates trusts and that has allowed

5 the courts for 200 years, probably longer than that, to

6 be comfortable to allow litigation to proceed in a

7 particular way.

8             But second of all and the second answer to

9 your first question is the prudential concerns remain

10 just, potentially just as serious.  I think the question

11 is do you want to create litigation devices that allow

12 the courts to avoid -- to allow lower courts or, more to

13 the point, allow plaintiffs to avoid the requirements

14 either of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 or the

15 associational standing doctrine.  Those are doctrines

16 that are designed to limit mass tort litigation in

17 particularized circumstances --

18             JUSTICE STEVENS:  You mentioned discovery.

19 I don't see why you can't get discovery against this

20 whole bunch of people.

21             MR. PHILLIPS:  Because they're not a party

22 to the litigation.  I mean, you can get discovery --

23             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Subpoenas out there and

24 depositions.

25             MR. PHILLIPS:  But, Justice Stevens, if you



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

11

1 sue me, you hail me into court, you put me to the

2 burdens of being a defendant in litigation, the least I

3 ought to get out of that is that I can turn to you and

4 ask you to admit certain facts, I can turn to you and

5 ask you to answer certain interrogatories, and I don't

6 have to go chasing you down, because you've already

7 submitted yourself to the personal jurisdiction of that

8 court.

9             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Of course, in this

10 particular situation you can do the same thing.  You can

11 file requests for admissions or serve interrogatories.

12 I don't understand why you can't do that.

13             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I can serve them on the

14 aggregator, but I cannot serve them on the party who in

15 fact has the relevant information that I need.  I have

16 to use third party subpoena power.

17             JUSTICE STEVENS:  I would assume the

18 aggregators have the relevant information.

19             MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm sorry, Justice Stevens?

20             JUSTICE STEVENS:  I would assume the

21 aggregator would have the relevant information.

22             MR. PHILLIPS:  In some instances it might or

23 it might not.  The problem is the aggregator has got to

24 get the information.

25             JUSTICE STEVENS:  But they have to -- they



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

12

1 have the burden of proof in the case and I assume they

2 have to investigate the facts and be prepared for

3 trial.

4             MR. PHILLIPS:  And that would help on the

5 affirmative case that they have to put together, but it

6 doesn't help with respect to the counterclaims.  The

7 Qwest amicus brief does a very nice job of explaining

8 that there are a lot of situations where the -- where

9 the payphone operators are overpaid and it's very

10 difficult -- first of all, and the aggregator has no

11 idea or any incentive to find out any of that, any of

12 that information.  And when Qwest made the requests of

13 the aggregator saying, provide me with the information,

14 the brief quotes in a variety of places comments such

15 as, you know, "whatever the -- our aggregator says is

16 fine with us," or "I don't care about those claims," or

17 answers like that, which, if I sue you -- I mean, if you

18 sue me and I ask for those, you cannot give me back

19 those answers.

20             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you can make that same

21 answer if it's just a standard assignee for collection

22 of -- of a debt for single person.

23             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, but if it's a simple

24 assignee for a debt and nothing more than that, just a

25 power of attorney -- or are you talking about a full



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

13

1 assignment?

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  No, no.  It's a full

3 assignment, where everybody agrees that there's

4 standing.

5             MR. PHILLIPS:  But in no circumstance --

6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You can make the same

7 argument:  Oh, he might not have all the information.

8             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, but at least there he

9 is also responsible for both -- he has the entirety of

10 the right.  He has the right and the remedy.  So that

11 whatever counterclaims you have operate directly against

12 that particular individual.

13             But even in that context, Justice Kennedy,

14 it seems to me there's a fundamental difference, as a

15 matter of prudence, between dealing with a single

16 assignee back and forth and the disputes that arise

17 there and the difficulty of discovery that would exist

18 there, and the situation we have here where you have

19 1400 payphone operators --

20             JUSTICE BREYER:  You have a discovery be

21 problem.  I don't see that it's a standing problem.  And

22 two things it reminds me of are, one very common, a

23 financer takes an interest in receivables and he's going

24 to have to collect them as receivables and there may be

25 50,000.  That could have the same kind of practical



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

14

1 problems.  Or we had cases in the First Circuit you may

2 or may not be aware of where somebody went around and

3 had assignments for 50,000 cabbages that were delivered

4 a day late in 50,000 box cars and each one was worth

5 about $10.  Nobody figured a way out of that.  They had

6 to pass a special statute.

7             There was -- and so it seems to me you're

8 better off than the cabbage people because have you two

9 possible remedies:  One on discovery; you could ask the

10 judge, Judge, see what the Communications Commission

11 thinks.  It's called primary jurisdiction of the kind.

12             MR. PHILLIPS:  But, Justice --

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  Or you could go to the FCC

14 and you say, FCC, you got us into this.

15             Now, you have some rules here that make some

16 sense in terms of collection.  You have both those

17 agency avenues open to you, not open to the cabbage

18 people, and this doesn't seem a standing problem.  Now,

19 what's your response to that?

20             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, there are two elements

21 of the standing problem:  The first one is we're all --

22 let's be clear -- we're talking about a hypothetical

23 that's different from this case because we're talking

24 about a hypothetical where in fact the assignee has a

25 concrete interest in the outcome of this dispute.  Here



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

15

1 the assignee has no interest in the outcome of this

2 dispute.  So the Article III problem arises there.

3             The question is if you have a minor amount

4 at interest, even if it's, you know, concrete but

5 nevertheless approaches de minimis, should you

6 nevertheless entertain that case.  And I think the

7 answer to your question, Justice Breyer, is that instead

8 of making this into a Federal court case, where you have

9 1400 claims like this, what the Court should say is that

10 the better course to follow is in fact for the

11 plaintiffs to take their claims, if they want to, in an

12 aggregate form to the FCC because that's the right

13 institution to deal with it because it doesn't have the

14 limitations of Article III and it doesn't have the

15 limitations of prudential standing to interfere with its

16 ability to provide complete relief.

17             And, indeed, if you read the Respondents'

18 brief, they identify, as the prototype litigation, in

19 which this entire system worked effectively, a claim

20 that was in fact litigated in front of the Federal

21 Communications Commission, not a case that was litigated

22 in front of the Federal court.  So, to my mind, the

23 right answer to this case is to take these cases all to

24 the FCC, not as a matter of what we do as primary

25 jurisdiction, but simply as what the plaintiffs do



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

16

1 because they don't have the vehicle to bring this to the

2 Federal courts.

3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But --

4             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What do you do about --

5 about aggregated plaintiffs who are not in the field of

6 Federal regulation?  They're just sort of out of luck?

7 Can they petition for the creation of an FCC that they

8 can take their claims to?  I mean, this is a fluke that

9 there happens to be this Federal agency they could have

10 gone to.  Certainly our principles of standing should

11 not depend upon that fluke, should it?

12             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think when the Court

13 is considering the questions of prudence, you know, it

14 can certainly take it into account, and maybe that would

15 argue in the alternative in another case if there

16 weren't such an available vehicle that the Court might

17 be more inclined to entertain it under those

18 circumstances.

19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Would there be review?

20 The FCC, you pointed out, doesn't have Article III

21 barriers.  So the FCC decides one way or another.  One

22 party ends up losing.  Is there review in Federal court?

23             MR. PHILLIPS:  I mean, Justice Ginsburg,

24 that is Spiller.  That's what the Court said in Spiller,

25 and I think it's a logical outgrowth of what the Court



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

17

1 held in ASARCO, which is that, even though a claim

2 doesn't start with Article III jurisdiction because it's

3 not an Article III entity, that when a final

4 determination comes out of that entity that is in fact

5 enforceable as a right that that right is enforceable

6 consistent with Article III notions.  And that's true.

7 That is what the Court essentially, without dealing with

8 Article III at all, said in Spiller, and that's clearly

9 what the Court held in ASARCO.

10             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What is the advantage?

11 You have proposed the FCC route.  That obviously wasn't

12 taken here.  What is the advantage of going to Federal

13 court on claims like this?

14             MR. PHILLIPS:  From my perspective or from

15 the plaintiffs' perspective.

16             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why would the plaintiff

17 make such a choice if the agency --

18             MR. PHILLIPS:  Because the -- the plaintiffs

19 here, the payphone operators, get a free pass in this

20 proceeding.  They get all of the benefits of being able

21 to go to Federal court and bring litigation with none of

22 the burdens of having to deal with discovery or

23 cross-claims or counterclaims or even necessarily being

24 bound by doctrines of res judicata and collateral

25 estoppel.  So you get all the benefits and none of the



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

18

1 disadvantages.  That's why it's an advantage for them to

2 go to Federal court.

3             JUSTICE BREYER:  How is that different?

4             MR. PHILLIPS:  When --

5             JUSTICE BREYER:  Just on that very point --

6 I need clarification on this.  How is that different

7 than the case of the financer who takes accounts

8 receivable, which is very common?  You finance the

9 accounts.  You take a secured interest in accounts

10 receivable.

11             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.

12             JUSTICE BREYER:  And there you might

13 foreclose on the secured interests.  Then you as the

14 financer have to collect from everybody.  How is your

15 case different from that?

16             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I don't know --

17             JUSTICE BREYER:  In the respect you were

18 just talking about.

19             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  Well, I mean, the

20 real question is I don't know why that case is

21 necessarily in Federal court either.  I mean, a lot of

22 that --

23             JUSTICE BREYER:  I know, but I mean, there

24 may be many reasons for that.  I'm just saying it's a

25 normal, practical problem, I believe, in the banking

1 community.  I don't know.

2             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, but most of that's

3 litigated in State courts, in which case there's no

4 serious problem --

5             JUSTICE BREYER:  Go back to my question, I'd

6 like to get an answer to it.

7             MR. PHILLIPS:  Certainly.

8             JUSTICE BREYER:  In respect to the problem

9 you were just mentioning, the discovery problem of

10 counterclaims or those problems, is this case any

11 different than the financing case I just mentioned?

12             MR. PHILLIPS:  No, I don't think so.

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  No.

14             MR. PHILLIPS:  I think those exact problems

15 would arise in that context as well.  On the other hand,

16 that's a situation that seems to me is largely driven by

17 the exigencies and by accident in Federal court.  This

18 is situation that is driven into Federal court by the

19 plaintiffs' choice and by the ability and the preference

20 to be in a position to get the benefits of litigation in

21 Federal court without any of the detriments that might

22 otherwise arise in that context.

23             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Could you explain that?

24 That really goes back to your answer in Justice

25 Ginsburg's question and I'm not getting it.  She said

20

1 why would you go to the Federal court if you can you go

2 to the FCC, and you said, well, you get the benefits of

3 being in Federal court.  What -- I should be asking

4 other counsel this question, but as you understand it

5 what is the benefit of being in the Federal court rather

6 than the FCC that makes this so attractive?

7             MR. PHILLIPS:  I guess I would encourage you

8 to ask counsel on the other side, because personally I

9 would think that they would have a full and fair remedy

10 --

11             JUSTICE SOUTER:  So you don't know of any

12 benefits?

13             MR. PHILLIPS:  I'm sorry?

14             JUSTICE SOUTER:  You don't know of any

15 benefits?

16             MR. PHILLIPS:  I don't know -- well, other

17 than the ones I've already articulated, where I think

18 they get some advantages of being in a Federal court and

19 have --

20             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, you eliminate step

21 one.  I mean, you go to the FCC, you win there, then

22 you've got to face an appeal before the Federal courts.

23 Why not go right to the Federal courts immediately?  You

24 eliminate one level of litigation.

25             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, and that may well be

Alderson Reporting Company

21

1 his answer.

2             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Well, I'd like you to go

3 back to the question that Justice Stevens, Justice

4 Breyer, and I asked you.  You said, oh, there's a

5 problem, there's no counterclaim, we can't get the

6 information.  And we say, well, that happens in every

7 accounts receivable assignment; there's no problem

8 there.  And then you say, well, that should be in State

9 court.  That's not right.

10             I thought it was agreed, stipulated by you

11 at the outset, that if there's a standard assignment for

12 collection you can be in the Federal court; there is

13 standing.

14             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right, there is Article III.

15             JUSTICE SOUTER:  And Article III.

16             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  And let's not lose

17 sight of that core question --

18             JUSTICE SOUTER:  If you're saying, if you're

19 saying that it's the aggregation that makes it difficult

20 to reach everybody, well, that's a question of

21 discovery, and it's still the aggregator's

22 responsibility.  If the aggregator can't answer

23 necessary questions for discovery of the suit, the

24 suit's dismissed.

25             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, that may or may not



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

22

1 have happen.  But let's be clear, okay.  The core

2 question here is whether or not an aggregator who has no

3 claim, who has no stake at all, not a penny's worth, can

4 pursue this litigation.  On that it seems to me the

5 answer got -- should be no.  There's no benefit to it.

6 The concrete stake is a core requirement of Article III

7 and the Court ought to enforce it as a separation of

8 powers question.

9             The issue that we've been discussing here is

10 what do you do when you get past that, and when you have

11 a kind of a bounty that's been attached to it, and how

12 do you resolve that?  In that situation, which is not

13 this case, I still think that there would be grounds for

14 prudential standing to serve as a basis to eliminate

15 this kind of litigation.  On the other hand, it may well

16 --

17             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But you said --

18             MR. PHILLIPS:  I am sorry, Your Honor.

19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said the aggregator

20 had -- that the aggregator could sue on behalf of these

21 1400 plaintiffs naming every one of them as a named

22 plaintiff in this complaint and still the aggregator

23 would run the show because they each authorized the

24 aggregator to conduct the litigation.

25             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

23

1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Now, it seems to me that

2 it's not very prudential to require that there be 1400

3 named plaintiffs instead of one.

4             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I mean, the price you

5 pay -- bless you -- is that when you bring Federal court

6 litigation -- is that you have to have -- you have to

7 expose yourself to exactly the burdens that come with

8 it.

9             JUSTICE SOUTER:  You also pay a price.  I

10 thought that's what you were going to get at.  Talking

11 about prudential standing, 1400 filing fees is pretty

12 prudential.

13             MR. PHILLIPS:  Right.  Federal courts

14 clearly have an interest in that.

15             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But I thought your

16 position was they could all join in one complaint just

17 as long as they're all named separately.

18             MR. PHILLIPS:  They can join in a single

19 complaint.  You know, the court can consider whether or

20 not it thinks joinder is appropriate under those

21 circumstances, but they could unquestionably do that.

22 But then, again, they are then at that point a plaintiff

23 in the litigation having brought this action and,

24 therefore, subject to all of the burdens of being a

25 plaintiff in the litigation, including submitting



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

24

1 themselves to the personal jurisdiction of the court.

2             I mean, let's be clear about this.  There

3 are 1400 names out of people all over the country that

4 under the -- under the plaintiffs aggregators' theory we

5 have to go chase down in order to obtain discovery, to

6 obtain any of our counterclaims or anything like that.

7 Whereas if they come into this Court and they submit

8 themselves to the jurisdiction, at least the process

9 works as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure --

10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I don't like to be

11 the broken record.  I'm just not getting -- I don't see

12 why that isn't the responsibility of the plaintiff.  The

13 district court said, now, you've brought these claims.

14 The defendants need this information.  You go get that.

15 That's your responsibility.

16             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, I don't doubt that the

17 trial court can do that, but the question is:  Why do we

18 have to go to the burden of having to chase all of that

19 in the first instance?

20             I mean, the Respondent's brief at page 10

21 criticizes us for not having brought 1400 third-party

22 complaints, not having sought additional discovery.  All

23 of those are burdens that simply arise in this context

24 that otherwise do not exist in an ordinary case where

25 you simply ask the party who has the actual claim to be



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

25

1 the plaintiff in front of the court.

2             And that's -- and, again, just to be clear,

3 we are still here dealing with the hypothetical.  We're

4 not dealing with the core question of what do you do

5 with a plaintiff who has not one penny at stake in

6 litigation that, as the lawyers describe, is all hard

7 cash.

8             JUSTICE SOUTER:  I'm sorry.  The only way,

9 it seems to me, that you can eliminate what you regard

10 as a problem is by having 1400 separate actions, so that

11 in any given case if you want discovery, your plaintiff,

12 the person who has got to provide that discovery, is

13 standing right there.

14             And I don't see how you can get the benefits

15 that you are claiming entitled to without having 1400

16 separate actions.  If you don't have 1400 separate

17 actions, whether you have an aggregation like this,

18 whether you have a joint action, whether you have a

19 class action, this problem of chasing down, as you

20 describe it, is going to be there.

21             So it seems to me the prudential question

22 for this Court is:  Do we really want to require 1400

23 separate actions so that you can have your perfect

24 paradigm of private litigation?  And to say, yes, we

25 want 1400 actions, it seems to me is a stretch.  What do



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

26

1 you say?

2             MR. PHILLIPS:  I think the answer to that is

3 that when you -- when you deal with mass tort

4 litigation, the Rules of Civil Procedure ought to apply

5 in that context as it applies in every other place.  And

6 when the courts deviate from the standard paradigm for

7 litigation, they do it expressly, either through the

8 rules or through doctrines that already exist.

9             And so we have Rule 23, which sets out very

10 clear protections for both the courts -- or not only for

11 the courts, but for the plaintiffs and for the absent

12 defendants -- absent, absent plaintiffs and for the

13 defendants, and is a clear mechanism for conducting 1400

14 claims all once in a particular situation.

15             JUSTICE SOUTER:  What does that have to do

16 with -- I guess that goes to prudential standing.

17             MR. PHILLIPS:  It goes directly --

18             JUSTICE SOUTER:  It has nothing to do with

19 Article III standing.

20             MR. PHILLIPS:  No, to be sure.  Again, I

21 don't think that -- I mean, the Article III debate here

22 seems to me to turn solely on the question of there is

23 no stake in the outcome of this case.  That's a bedrock

24 requirement of Article III and ought to be a basis for

25 simply reversing.  But, you know, to the extent that the



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

27

1 Court then goes beyond that and worries about what's the

2 next case going to look like and what are the prudential

3 limitations, which I don't think the Court has to

4 resolve any of this, what I would suggest is the Court

5 should be informed by Rule 23 and associational standing

6 and those doctrines --

7             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Are you saying, in effect,

8 that if we get to the prudential-standing point, the

9 answer is that in the absence of a rule comparable to

10 Rule 23 we should not recognize prudential standing, but

11 that if we adopted a rule that sort of regulated how

12 this would work, prudential standing would be

13 appropriate?  Is that basically it?

14             MR. PHILLIPS:  I think that's the right

15 answer, is that the Court shouldn't just make it up as

16 it goes along.  And if there is a need for this -- look,

17 and the truth is we've been here 200 years.  We haven't

18 had to have aggregator standing all of this time.  It

19 strikes me that there's no compelling need for a change

20 and that for that reason the Court ought to go back to

21 the paradigm example, plaintiffs sue defendants and you

22 have normal discovery and counterclaims.

23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is there any significance

24 to this being the -- this assignment transfers legal

25 title.  True, there's an obligation to pay, to pay the



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

28

1 separate PSPs.  But does anything turn on legal title?

2 For example, suppose the -- I gather the check would be

3 payable to the aggregator if the aggregator prevails.

4 Could a creditor of the aggregator come in and say,

5 stop, you owe me lots of money and I want to reach those

6 proceeds?

7             MR. PHILLIPS:  That -- I mean the proceeds

8 -- I assume -- do those claims arise out of the

9 relationship between the payphone operators and the

10 aggregator?

11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  No.

12             MR. PHILLIPS:  It's completely unrelated to

13 that?  It's just a garnishment on it?

14             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  These are just the

15 creditors.  Or the aggregator goes bankrupt.

16             MR. PHILLIPS:  I assume those moneys could

17 be taken out of the aggregator and then the PSP would

18 have a claim over against the aggregator for breach of

19 contract.

20             If I could reserve the balance of my time.

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,

22 Mr. Phillips.

23             Mr. Englert.

24             ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.

25                 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

29

1             MR. ENGLERT:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

2 and may it please the Court:

3             One of the last things Mr. Phillips said was

4 there's no need to change the law in this case and I

5 strongly agree with that.  Assignees for collection have

6 been litigating in Federal courts since at least the

7 19th century and there is not one decision cited in any

8 of the briefs in this case in which an assignee's

9 lawsuit was dismissed solely because of what the

10 assignee intended to do with the proceeds.

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  But also not one in which

12 the issue of standing was raised and decided.  And our

13 jurisprudence says that where we do not address the

14 issue of standing the case has no precedential value on

15 the subject.

16             MR. ENGLERT:  Justice Scalia, a single

17 decision, a small body of decisions that don't address

18 the issue of standing, can be looked at in that way.

19 But a unanimous body of case law, two decisions from

20 this Court, arguably a third decision from this Court,

21 many decisions from lower courts --        JUSTICE

22 SCALIA:  I don't consider two decisions an enormous

23 body.

24             MR. ENGLERT:  But there is an enormous body

25 in the lower courts under Rule 17.



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

30

1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, we don't count the

2 lower courts.

3             (Laughter.)

4             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Mr. Englert, with respect

5 to what weight we should give to those decisions, I just

6 want to put a simple hypo and I'll ask a question on it.

7 Assume that in this case the assignment -- well, assume

8 another case, rather, in which the assignment is

9 identical is identical to this one, except that the

10 terms of the second agreement, i.e., if I the aggregator

11 collect anything I give it to you.  Assume that is part

12 of the first agreement, so that there is an assignment

13 and as part of the assigning document there is a stated

14 obligation on the part of the assignee to pay all

15 proceeds to the assignor.

16             I am assuming that your position would be

17 the same; is that correct?

18             MR. ENGLERT:  Absolutely.

19             JUSTICE SOUTER:  Now, my question is, you're

20 taking that position, I think, just as you did in

21 response to Justice Scalia, on the grounds that there is

22 a huge body of law that assignment for collection

23 conveys adequate standing.  But are any of the

24 assignment for collection cases in that body of law

25 clearly cases like the one in my hypothetical in which



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

31

1 the assignment itself by its terms requires the total

2 payment of any benefit back to the assignor?

3             MR. ENGLERT:  Justice Souter, the cases

4 don't always discuss the way in which the assignment

5 arose.  But typically, in those cases they simply say,

6 there are these two promises, and they say the fact that

7 there is a second promise makes no difference.  That's

8 my position.  The fact that there's a second promise,

9 whether in the same document or in a different document,

10 makes no difference.

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's the earliest of

12 those cases in our Court?

13             MR. ENGLERT:  The earliest case --

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  The earliest case in our

15 Court that upholds this that, without specifically

16 addressing the standing issue, gives judgment?

17             MR. ENGLERT:  The earliest case that gives

18 judgment is Spiller in 1920.

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  1920?

20             MR. ENGLERT:  Yes.

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:  In Vermont Agency, in the

22 Vermont Agency case, which dealt with qui tam, that many

23 people, including the Justice Department, thought did

24 not confer Article III standing, we held to the contrary

25 that it did confer Article III standing, mainly because



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

32

1 it had been around forever.  It was -- it was the

2 understood part of the judicial power when the

3 Constitution was adopted.

4             Do you have any case prior to 1920 in which

5 English courts or even early American courts thought

6 that this, that this would be sufficient to bring a

7 lawsuit?

8             MR. ENGLERT:  Well, assignee standing, not

9 assignee for collection standing but assignee standing,

10 is referred to in Blackstone's Commentaries

11 contemporaneously with the Constitution.

12             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sure, but --

13             MR. ENGLERT:  This wrinkle of arguing --

14             JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's more than a wrinkle.

15 The assignee keeps the money.

16             MR. ENGLERT:  But the wrinkle of arguing

17 that that makes a difference as far as I know first

18 arose in the 19th century.  And every single case and

19 every single Federal court that has considered the

20 question under any body of law has rejected the

21 argument.

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  What's the earliest Federal

23 court case you have?

24             MR. ENGLERT:  Late 18th -- late 19th

25 century.



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

33

1             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Late 19th century?

2             MR. ENGLERT:  Yes.

3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We're not under any

4 body of law.  I didn't see any cases cited after we had

5 more carefully explicated our understanding of Article

6 III.  What's the latest case from this Court that you've

7 got?

8             MR. ENGLERT:  Well, as you know, I argue

9 that the Vermont Agency case strongly supports us.  But

10 if you want a case specifically about assigning

11 collection, then the latest case I have is Titus in

12 1939.

13             JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, aren't Titus and

14 Spiller different in that there the assignee is suing on

15 a judgment that was obtained in a forum where Article

16 III didn't apply?

17             MR. ENGLERT:  No, absolutely not, Justice

18 Alito.

19             JUSTICE ALITO:  Why isn't that irrelevant?

20             MR. ENGLERT:  Because for the exact reason

21 Mr. Phillips gave you.  The ASARCO case and Coleman v.

22 Miller, Justice Frankfurter's concurring opinion, and a

23 number of other cases stand for the proposition that a

24 party who invokes the jurisdiction of this Court or of

25 any other Federal court must satisfy Article III.  So



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

34

1 when Spiller, the secretary of the Cattleman's

2 Association, went to the Federal district court seeking

3 enforcement of the reparations award he had gotten

4 before the ICC, he had to satisfy Article III.

5             When Titus came to this Court arguing that

6 the lower courts had not properly given full faith and

7 credit, he had to satisfy Article III.  Each of those

8 parties invoking the jurisdiction of the Federal court

9 was someone who had to turn over 100 percent of the

10 proceeds to the assignors.  And in each case this Court

11 rejected the argument that he was not a proper

12 plaintiff.

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, you say in

14 your brief that there is no reason for concern about the

15 absence of concrete adverseness.  But I would have

16 thought there was a great deal of reason for concern and

17 that your client doesn't care if he wins or loses.

18             MR. ENGLERT:  My client --

19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's all the same to

20 him.  If he wins, he doesn't get to keep the money; if

21 he loses, he loses.

22             MR. ENGLERT:  Well, that's -- that's false

23 in every possible respect, Your Honor.  He does keep --

24 get to keep some of the money.  Now, we haven't proved

25 that in the lower court.  It's an allegation at this



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

35

1 point, but it happens to be true.  But aside from

2 that --

3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought the

4 question came to us on the assumption that he doesn't

5 retain any of the money.

6             MR. ENGLERT:  On the assumption, but not the

7 fact.

8             Second, my client's whole reason for

9 existence is to collect payphone compensation.  This is

10 what my client does day in and day out.

11             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I thought our

12 cases made clear that that kind of -- -- I forget what

13 we call it -- it's a separate interest from the injury

14 that you're alleging in the lawsuit.  You don't allege

15 in the lawsuit that the basis for Article III injury is

16 that you're in this line of work and if the work dries

17 up you're in big trouble.  That wouldn't be enough to

18 support Article III standing.

19             MR. ENGLERT:  No.  What's enough to support

20 Article III standing is the interest of the assignors,

21 as the Court held in Vermont Agency.

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but then why

23 is the assignee bringing the lawsuit?

24             MR. ENGLERT:  The assignee --

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  He had no



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

36

1 independent injury.

2             MR. ENGLERT:  The assignee is bringing the

3 lawsuit for the most pragmatic of all possible reasons.

4 Mr. Phillips wanted to talk a lot about discovery, and

5 Justice Kennedy and I believe Justice Souter asked why

6 is this lawsuit in Federal court instead of before the

7 FCC.  There are good answers to those questions.

8             The discovery in Federal court, the

9 discovery available in Federal court, is more

10 appropriate to -- is more necessary in a large case, a

11 $200 million case like this one, than in a relatively

12 small case --

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, we got

14 off the track here.

15             MR. ENGLERT:  We did.

16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm trying to find

17 out what the assignee's injury is.

18             MR. ENGLERT:  The -- the assignee's

19 injury --

20             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And how it's

21 redressed by the receipt of the money.

22             MR. ENGLERT:  It is, as this Court said in

23 Vermont Agency, the assignor's injury and it is

24 redressed by --

25             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No.  But you know,

1 Vermont Agency, obviously, the assignee recovers

2 something himself, that he gets to keep the bounty.

3 Here that's not the case.

4             MR. ENGLERT:  Here that's not the case, but

5 the reasoning of Vermont Agency specifically rejected

6 the proposition that the bounty was helpful to the

7 assignee's standing.  And there is not a word in Vermont

8 Agency that says when you combine the bounty with the

9 assignor's interest that's enough.  It just says the

10 assignor's interest is enough, full stop, because of the

11 ancient doctrine.

12             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  I thought it said -- I

13 thought it said, Mr. Englert, that, that the United

14 States has -- is treated as having assigned part of its

15 claim for damages to the qui tam relator, and that gave

16 the qui tam plaintiff a stake in the action, a stake in

17 the proceeds.  I thought that Vermont Agency -- and

18 Justice Scalia will correct me if I'm wrong -- was

19 envisioning the kind of assignment that Judge Sentelle

20 was talking about when he said there are assignments and

21 then there are assignments.

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I was under the same

23 misimpression, I have to say, and I wrote it.

24             (Laughter.)

25             MR. ENGLERT:  The -- the assignment in this



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

38

1 case conveys all right, title and interest.  It conveys

2 it for purposes of collection to be sure, but it conveys

3 all right, title and interest.

4             Now, the proposition that the "for purposes

5 of collection" purpose of an assignment negates the

6 ability of the plaintiffs to sue is one that has been

7 litigated many times in Federal courts, and that

8 argument has been rejected in every case in which it's

9 come up until now, including two from this Court.  So

10 between the fact that the reasoning of Vermont Agency,

11 whatever the facts were, relied on the interest of the

12 assignor, relied on the ancient doctrine that the

13 assignee for Article III purposes stands in the

14 assignor's shoes, and the fact that this argument has

15 been rejected in every case in which it's come up, I

16 think the case for Article III standing is quite strong

17 here.

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:  I must say we seem to have

19 come full circle from Flash v. Cohen, which said that

20 the doctrine of standing had nothing whatever to do with

21 Article III.  That it all -- the only thing it's there

22 for is to assure that concrete adverseness on which our

23 adversary system depends.  You've come full circle from

24 that to now your argument that concrete adverseness

25 doesn't matter at all.

1             MR. ENGLERT:  Oh, Justice Scalia --

2             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is there a combination of

3 the two that's possible, that maybe one of the elements

4 of Article III standing is that both parties have a

5 stake in winning and losing?

6             MR. ENGLERT:  There is tremendous concrete

7 adverseness in this case.  And both parties have a great

8 stake in winning and losing.  The -- the aggregator

9 doesn't get to keep the money, although actually it

10 does, but this case can be decided on the assumption,

11 subject to remand that it doesn't get to keep the money.

12 But it exists for the purpose of bringing -- of

13 obtaining redress from carriers obtaining payphone

14 compensation from carriers, usually outside the

15 litigation process.  But this is -- but this is what my

16 client does -- what my clients do.

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The Sierra Club

18 protect -- undertakes activities to protect the

19 environment, but that doesn't give it standing in every

20 environmental case to sue.  It needs to show members

21 what the concrete interest and so on.  The fact that

22 your client is in the business of suing on behalf of

23 payphone operators --

24             MR. ENGLERT:  My client is not in the

25 business of suing on the business of payphone operators.

2 outside the litigation process.  This is merely an

3 extension of the day-to-day operation.

4             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you tell me is this

5 1,400 causes of action or is it one?

6             MR. ENGLERT:  One.

7             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  How does that come about?

8 Suppose a lot of people owe the bank -- a lot of farmers

9 owe the bank money, can there be assignment in this one

10 cause of action?

11             MR. ENGLERT:  Sure.  And let me give you

12 one --

13             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And how does the law

14 express the metaphysical process in which 1,400 causes

15 of action become one cause of action?

16             MR. ENGLERT:  Well, they are all assigned to

17 one entity that brings the cause of action just as a

18 trustee brings causes of action --

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, there is not a

20 representative cause of action.  What is the magic point

21 at which it becomes one cause of action?

22             MR. ENGLERT:  The point at which they are

23 all assigned to one entity that then brings the cause of

24 action, and importantly, has authority to settle the

25 cause of action without any further permission from the

1 clients.  The -- a very, very important protection here

2 for Mr. Phillips --

3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm still missing

4 something here.  Can you give me an example of where

5 this has happened in other cases that this Court has

6 heard that are commonly heard?

7             MR. ENGLERT:  Every Rule 23 class action,

8 every associational standing case, every trustee action.

9             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I interrupted you and I

10 talked over you.  Every Rule 23 cause of action and what

11 else?

12             MR. ENGLERT:  Every associational standing

13 case, every action brought by a trustee.

14             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, associational

15 standing, Sierra Club v. Morton, they are interested in

16 an ongoing injury in which there is a common -- in which

17 there is a common injury.  These are liquidated amounts.

18             MR. ENGLERT:  But that's not uncommon, Your

19 Honor.  Justice Souter's opinion for the Court in United

20 Food and Commercial Workers v. Brown reported a Seventh

21 Circuit case that said representative damages litigation

22 is common from class actions under Rule 23 to suits by

23 trustees representing hundreds of creditors in

24 bankruptcy, to parent patriot actions by State

25 governments to litigation by and against executors at

Alderson Reporting Company

42

1 decedent's estates.  This is something that happens

2 every day in Federal court.

3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Those are usually ongoing

4 injuries as to which there's a common interest in

5 stopping the injury.  Here you're aggregating liquidated

6 amounts.

7             MR. ENGLERT:  It's actually not entirely

8 liquidated amounts.  There are ongoing disputes about

9 ongoing payphone compensation.  But I don't think it

10 would make any difference even if that weren't true.

11             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I might understand it if

12 was some sort of injunction actions -- in the future

13 please pay what you're supposed to pay.

14             MR. ENGLERT:  No.  But, Justice Kennedy,

15 consider the typical Rule 23 damages action, which is

16 about amounts due in the ordinary case.  You have one

17 cause of action on behalf of the class instead of many

18 causes of action on behalf of many people.  It happens

19 all the time.

20             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But that's allowed because

21 the requisites for class actions have been met and

22 that's authorized by the rule.  That's not true here.

23             MR. ENGLERT:  Because we have something much

24 better here.  What we have here, Justice Kennedy, is

25 assignments of the cause of actions by every plaintiff

1 to my clients completely --

2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  There are a lot of better

3 procedures that are in the rules but it is not in the

4 rule.

5             MR. ENGLERT:  Actually there is.  Rule 17

6 was put in the rules.  And if you read the works of

7 Judge Charles Park, you will see that Rule 17 was put in

8 the rules to authorize justice kind of action to be

9 brought in the name of assignees, including asignees for

10 collection.  And one year after he joined the Federal --

11             JUSTICE STEVENS:  May I ask a fact question?

12 I'm just a little puzzled here.  I probably should have

13 asked Mr. Phillips.  But what issues in fact are there

14 going to be in this case?  It seems to me everything

15 ought to be on computer somewhere, and it's just a

16 matter of pushing the right button and you know how much

17 money you owe.  Am I missing something?

18             MR. ENGLERT:  You're not missing something,

19 Justice Stevens.  That's what this case is about, is

20 computer records, massive computer records in possession

21 of the carriers and some tools the aggregators have to

22 analyze computer records.

23             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Except for counterclaims.

24 He says I have some counterclaims.

25             MR. ENGLERT:  He says he has some



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

44

1 counterclaims, but in nine years of litigation his

2 clients have never used Rule 19; they have never used

3 Rule 22; they have never made any effort -- he says we

4 have asserted they have to go out and bring 1,400

5 separate lawsuits.  What we said on page 10 of our brief

6 was they have never tried in nine years of of litigation

7 to use --

8             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what did they do?

9 I mean, you mention necessary parties but these other --

10 on your own theory the PSPs are not necessary parties,

11 and this -- this is a defendant seeking to join

12 additional plaintiffs, and that's rather odd.  And you

13 also talk about interpleader.  I don't know who is the

14 stakeholder in this picture.

15             MR. ENGLERT:  Well, Your Honor, my point is

16 that there are many procedural devices available to deal

17 with many situations like this, Rule 19 and Rule 22 and

18 separate lawsuits.  If there were serious counterclaims

19 in this case, first of all as a factual matter, AT&T and

20 Sprint would know it from their own records and second,

21 they would have done something in nine years to try to

22 bring a claim against PSP, and they have done nothing in

23 nine years.  So this is a very, very odd case in which

24 to be worrying about whether they have lost some

25 counterclaim rights because the PSPs -- lost some



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

45

1 counterclaim rights because the PSPs aren't individual

2 parties.

3             It's also a very odd case in which to be

4 worrying about discovery rights because the PSPs aren't

5 individual parties because that issue was resolved in

6 their favor in 2000 by the special master's discovery

7 order saying, just as Justice Stevens postulated, the

8 aggregator to go out and get the information from the

9 PSPs.

10             Now they complained that some of the PSPs,

11 some of these mom and pop operations, said we don't have

12 any information.  That's because for the most part the

13 PSP don't have any information.  The information resides

14 with the carriers and with the aggregators.  So as a

15 purely practical, pragmatic matter this is not the case

16 in which to be worrying that some discovery rights have

17 been lost; this is not the case in which to be worrying

18 in which some counterclaim rights have been lost; this

19 is not the case in which to be worrying that my clients

20 aren't' bound.  Every single -- I'm sorry, that the PSPs

21 aren't bound, the assignors aren't bound, because every

22 single one of them has signed an agreement, or two

23 agreements, really, saying they will be bound.  What

24 this comes down to is a series of abstractions put up

25 against the tradition of allowing lawsuits by assignee



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

46

1 for collection.

2             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well I guess it could be

3 that you're asking them to go back into records that are

4 somewhat old.  What you're asking to find out is -- is

5 every call made out of a payphone that was long distance

6 call, and we don't even know who actually turned out to

7 be the carrier.  It's like asking them, tell us exactly

8 on the payphone at that corner over there who was called

9 at 9:15 a.m. to some number in 1987, and maybe they

10 should have records of that but they don't.  They have

11 estimates --

12             MR. ENGLERT:  No, they do.  There is no --

13             JUSTICE BREYER:  They say maybe the time

14 necessary to go through those records, to figure out

15 whether you should give 12 cents to the person who ran

16 that payphone, is really not worth it.

17             MR. ENGLERT:  Well --

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  And therefore, if they are

19 right in some claim like that, is there a way to get

20 this worked out at the FCC?  I mean, it -- it -- I don't

21 think it was the purpose of this statute to have 12 cent

22 claims, even aggravated, brought back years later under

23 some set of procedural rule that will be so expensive to

24 get the discovery that this just won't be worth it.

25             Now that might be right.  And if it is right



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

47

1 or whether it's right, can the FCC work this out?

2             MR. ENGLERT:  Your Honor, several points if

3 I may.  47 U.S.C. in section 276 says that payphone

4 service providers are to be compensated for each and

5 every payphone call.  So it was Congress's purpose to

6 make any 24 cent call compensable, and the FCC set up a

7 very elaborate system to make them keep records.

8             JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm aware of that system.

9 I'm aware of that.

10             MR. ENGLERT:  Well, as -- and there is about

11 $200 million at stake in this case so this is not about

12 each 24-cent payphone call individually.  This is a

13 properly advocated case.

14             JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  But my question is

15 to get to that figure there may be billions of calls,

16 for all I know.

17             MR. ENGLERT:  There are.

18             JUSTICE BREYER:  And it could be quite

19 expensive to track down each of those calls

20 individually.  I don't know if it is or not; but if it

21 is, is there a way to get this problem worked out at the

22 FCC or do we have the cabbage case grown large?

23             MR. ENGLERT:  Your Honor, my client has

24 brought scores of these actions -- my clients have

25 brought scores of these actions, some before the FCC,



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

48

1 the largest ones -- and this is the largest one of

2 all -- in Federal court to get the advantage of the

3 discovery processes in Federal court.  Most of these

4 cases settle.  These cases as Justice Stevens pointed

5 out are about analyzing computer records, and you can

6 fight to the death or you can say let's figure out who

7 owes whom what and let's settle; and most of the cases

8 settle.  There is no reason why there should be any more

9 or less incentive to settle when the case is before the

10 FCC than when it's before a Federal court.

11             JUSTICE BREYER:  In settlement they may work

12 out.  But if it is -- for example costs a dollar to

13 fight a claim that's worth 12 cents, individually,

14 before you get to billions, they don't want to be in

15 that situation where they are really paying money for

16 nothing; because in their opinion they already paid.

17             I mean we understand this kind of problem.

18 So I go back to my question.  They have one view of it;

19 you have another of what's going on here.  And their

20 view is very unfavorable to your clients and your

21 clients' view is very unfavorable to their clients.  So

22 I would like to know is there a way to get this worked

23 out at the FCC?  Maybe that will turn out not to be

24 relevant in this case but I'd still like to know your

25 opinion.



Official - Subject to Final Review

49

1             MR. ENGLERT:  Well, this case was brought in

2 Federal court under a statute that permits the

3 plaintiffs to choose whether to go to Federal Supreme

4 Court or the FCC.  The reason it's nine years old is not

5 because we didn't sue immediately; it's because we've

6 been litigating for nine years about our right to

7 litigate.

8             Does the FCC have a useful role to play in

9 this process at this point?  Never say never, but I

10 don't see one.  The case was brought in Federal court

11 under a doctrine that has always allowed assignees for

12 collection to sue in Federal court, and there is no

13 reason I can think of why it shouldn't proceed in

14 Federal court.

15             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Englert, is this one

16 lawsuit or 1,400 lawsuits, or however many clients you

17 have?

18             MR. ENGLERT:  It's one lawsuit.

19             JUSTICE SCALIA:  How can it be -- how is it

20 one lawsuit when there are, I mean, just a lot of

21 different individual claims?  You think you could have

22 brought this as a class action?

23             MR. ENGLERT:  We, after Judge Sentelle

24 dismissed this case, we moved to the alternative to

25 amend our complaint to add either 1,400 individual



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

50

1 plaintiffs or a class action.  The plaintiffs opposed

2 that, and then she reversed herself on --

3             JUSTICE SCALIA:  They opposed it on what

4 seems to be a reasonable ground, that each of these

5 claims is quite different.  There are different calls,

6 different -- different amounts owing.  Each case is not

7 going to be judged on the same -- on the same facts.

8             MR. ENGLERT:  That's really not true,

9 Justice Scalia.  Just it's a pure practical matter,

10 leaving aside theory, this is about analyzing computer

11 databases.  This is about analyzing call records.

12 Because of the system the FCC set up, none of the

13 information resides with the PSPs; it resides with the

14 aggregators and with the carriers.

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do you agree that this

16 could not have been brought as a class action?

17             MR. ENGLERT:  No, I disagree, Justice

18 Kennedy.

19             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Why didn't you bring it as

20 a class action?

21             MR. ENGLERT:  I'm sorry?

22             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Then why didn't you bring

23 it as a class action?  We can all go home.

24             MR. ENGLERT:  Because it's so much better to

25 bring it on behalf of individuals who have expressly



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

51

1 consented to be bound, than on behalf of people who may

2 not even know about it and who may not have consented to

3 be bound and may not want to be bound as in the typical

4 class action.

5             There are all sorts of problems with class

6 actions.  Class actions are typically brought by

7 enterprising law firms who may not ever have met their

8 clients.  This is a different litigation altogether.

9 This is litigation by a trade association that exists to

10 collect payphone compensation, doing the same thing it

11 always does, only doing it in court on behalf of 1,400

12 companies that each signed an agreement saying I want

13 you to go do this for me and I agree to be bound by the

14 result.  So I can get entitlement interest.

15             JUSTICE BREYER:  Do you -- this is giving me

16 a thought here.  Just a total imaginary case, nothing to

17 do with your clients.  Put yourself in the opposite

18 position.  Suppose you were representing a defendant and

19 that defendant were asked by this imaginary plaintiff to

20 dig up records on the computer.  To dig up each

21 individual record costs $1, there were billions of such

22 records, and the value to you, to the other side, the

23 plaintiff, imaginary in this case, was 12 cents a call.

24 Okay?  So you say look, those people are asking us to

25 dig up billions of records, it's going to cost us a



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

52

1 dollar each to do it, and all they are going to get out

2 of it is 12 cents a call.  But of course we are the ones

3 who have to pay the dollar, and they get the 12 cents.

4 Now, is there a way for the legal system to solve that

5 problem?

6             MR. ENGLERT:  Yes.

7             JUSTICE BREYER:  Other than standing.

8             MR. ENGLERT:  Push the parties to settle.

9 That's what rational economics --

10             JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, the defendant says --

11 now your client, I am not going to settle; there are no

12 such claims.  This is ridiculous but it's going to cost

13 me a dollar to prove it.

14             MR. ENGLERT:  Yeah, the client says millions

15 for defense, but not one cent -- one cent for tribute

16 and every lawyer gets happy, because the client wants to

17 litigate to the death instead of just surrendering to

18 extortion, in that kind of case they have to decide

19 whether the economically rational thing is to set a bad

20 precedent or is to settle.

21             That happens all the day for defense counsel

22 and I'm quite often defense counsel --

23             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Speaking -- speaking

24 --

25             MR. ENGLERT -- but this case is not of that



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

53

1 nature.

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Speaking of one cent

3 for tribute, it's easy to get rid of this problem, isn't

4 it?

5             MR. ENGLERT:  Prospectively.

6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why don't your

7 agreements just say you get to keep $10 out of every sum

8 that your recover?  Then we wouldn't have this problem.

9             MR. ENGLERT:  I agree, and we made that

10 point in our brief in opposition to cert.  This case is

11 of no practical significance going forward for the body

12 of the law.  There's nothing this Court is going to

13 decide in this case that's going to make a difference.

14 People will just draft their assignment and --

15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So why --

16             MR. ENGLERT:  So my clients --

17             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why doesn't the tie

18 go to Article III?  I mean if it makes no difference

19 either way I'd like to preserve significance of Article

20 III as a limit on court jurisdiction.

21             MR. ENGLERT:  Article III is a proper and

22 important limit on court jurisdiction when it restricts

23 court jurisdiction.  When we have a traditional cause of

24 action, the abstractions that have come to be thought of

25 as Article III jurisprudence don't trump tradition.

1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but --

2             MR. ENGLERT:  What Article III --

3             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, Article III

4 does trump tradition.  I mean, if it doesn't meet

5 Article III, no amount of tradition can save it.  And

6 you several times refer, when asked one of these

7 questions, to the tradition and the old cases, but I

8 haven't heard an answer yet to the concrete injury that

9 is suffered by the aggregators.

10             MR. ENGLERT:  The -- on the assumption on

11 which this case comes to the Court, the aggregators'

12 injury is the assigned injury of the assignors.  We are

13 taking the principle of Vermont Agency and saying that

14 applies just as much to assignees for collection as it

15 does to any other assignees.  Contrary to Mr. Phillips'

16 position and Judge Sentelle's position, that there are

17 assignments and then there are assignments, the law has

18 looked many times at the question whether there are

19 assignments and then there are assignments.  The

20 argument that assignees for collection should be treated

21 differently has been made many times.  It has never

22 prevailed in Federal court, unless and until it prevails

23 in this case.

24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The significance --

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Englert, could you --



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

55

1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  -- to the legal title,

2 would it make a difference if the assignee did not have

3 legal title, was just --

4             MR. ENGLERT:  Oh, it would make a huge

5 difference, Justice Ginsburg.

6             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So -- but is that just a

7 formality?  For example, the question I asked

8 Mr. Phillips.  Could a creditor of the aggregator get at

9 this money when the check is paid by AT&T and Sprint and

10 therefore reduce the amount available to distribute to

11 the PSPCs?

12             MR. ENGLERT:  Well, if we assume insolvency

13 and we assume a secured creditor, then, yes, I think the

14 PSPs are general unsecured creditors, and the secured

15 creditor is in line ahead of them.  Different facts,

16 different results.  But, yes, it does make a difference

17 if the assignee enters insolvency, which is not going to

18 happen in this case, but if the assignee enters

19 insolvency and if there is a creditor that arguably

20 under insolvency principles has a higher claim than the

21 PSPs, yes, it does make a difference to the assignee.

22             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How about for tax

23 purposes?  Must the aggregator report the proceeds as

24 income?

25             MR. ENGLERT:  Your Honor, I'm sorry.  I just



Official - Subject to Final Review

56

1 don't know the answer to that question.  I'm guessing

2 they either don't report them as income or they report

3 them as income, but then have a deduction in the exact

4 same amount.  But I really don't know the exact answer

5 to that.

6             JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Englert, can you

7 explain to me again how it is that when you acquire 14

8 separate choses in action, 14 separate claims, against

9 the same defendant, just by your acquiring them they

10 sort of melt into one cause of action.  How does that --

11 how does that happen?

12             MR. ENGLERT:  That happens the same way it

13 happens under Rule 23.  It happens the same way it

14 happens with the trustee who is representing people who

15 would otherwise have many different causes of action.

16 It's a very common thing in Federal court.  If the -- if

17 a bankruptcy trustee or if a class representative brings

18 a lawsuit on behalf of many people, then there is one

19 cause of action instead of the many causes of action

20 there would be if those many people sued directly.  It's

21 not an issue.

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In all of those

23 cases, the class action, the trustee, you know, the

24 named plaintiff, the named trustee has concrete injury

25 and redressability to themselves?



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

57

1             MR. ENGLERT:  No more than my clients.

2             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Very much more than

3 your clients.  The trustee has legal obligations that he

4 has to discharge.  If it's a suit that he has to bring

5 on behalf of the beneficiaries and doesn't do it, he is

6 sued for breach of trust.  In a class action case, the

7 representative has to have standing, has to show

8 concrete injury and redressability.  Here we don't have

9 any of that.

10             MR. ENGLERT:  I respectfully disagree, Your

11 Honor.  My clients have legal obligations that they have

12 to discharge.  They are embodied in the very agreements

13 reproduced in the back of the red brief, that require us

14 to pursue this action and require us to turn over --

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But why do we have Rule 23

16 that requires certification of a class action?  If you

17 can say, well, I don't need Rule 23, I'm going to take

18 1400 claims and make them one any way.

19             MR. ENGLERT:  For very good reasons.  Rule

20 23 exists to protect absent plaintiffs, something we

21 don't have here, and to protect defendants so that they

22 will know there will be a res judicata effect of the

23 judgment, whether for them or against them, so that they

24 can't be sued by other class members.

25             They have those protections.  In fact, if



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

58

1 you read the blue and yellow briefs in this case, they

2 keep referring in the abstract to the protections of

3 Rule 23, but they don't identify a single concrete

4 protection that they do not have under this system.

5 Rule 23 is inferior to an action by assignees for

6 collection in every imaginable way.  It's not a superior

7 alternative.  And to say that the existence of Rule 23

8 means we should throw out a traditional form of action

9 that's been recognized for well over a century would be

10 a very surprising result.

11             Thank you.

12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,

13 Mr. Englert.

14             Three minutes, Mr. Phillips.  You might

15 start by the point your friend just made.  What is the

16 protection that Rule 23 provides that you don't have?

17             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

18                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

19             MR. PHILLIPS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

20             The specific protection is that the courts

21 determine how the settlements will play out.  They make

22 sure that all of the requirements of Rule 23 are

23 satisfied before the litigation goes forward.  That

24 means that there is a demonstration of commonality, that

25 there -- the predominance issue is resolved, that this



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

59

1 is a matter that should be litigated in this forum

2 because it is a more efficient mechanism for litigating

3 it, not because the assignor -- assignee decided that

4 this is more efficient way from the assignee's

5 perspective --

6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And are problems --

7             MR. PHILLIPS:  -- to litigate the issue.

8             JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are the requirements of

9 typicality and -- the same type of injury designed in

10 part to preserve the rights of the defendant?

11             MR. PHILLIPS:  Yes, of course, because you

12 don't want to have all this litigation being heaped on a

13 particular defendant under these circumstances.  There

14 is an efficiency to this process that the rules

15 anticipate.  And I think you're absolutely right,

16 Justice Kennedy.  There is simply no reason in the world

17 to say we're going to allow this to be as a substitute

18 for existing doctrines under either Rule 23 --

19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But wouldn't you --

20             MR. PHILLIPS:  -- or associational standing.

21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose this had been

22 mounted as a class action.  I take it you would oppose

23 certification.

24             MR. PHILLIPS:  To be sure, and my answer is

25 --



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

60

1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And one of the reasons

2 would be that these are all different situations,

3 different amounts involved in each case?  Some -- you

4 would have a counterclaim, not others.  I assume you

5 would say they're not a lot alike.  Not at all alike.

6             MR. PHILLIPS:  Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg.

7 We would oppose it.  I don't think that this is a proper

8 case for class certification.  But it seems to me that

9 that doesn't mean okay, and, therefore, the answer to

10 this is:  Come up with some other contrivance in order

11 to litigate this in a way that obviously maximizes the

12 convenience to one side without regard to the

13 protections that are designed both for the defendant and

14 for the court that's embodied in Rule 23.

15             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Mr. Phillips, do you

16 attach any significance to the fact that every member of

17 the so-called class here has individually agreed to be

18 bound by the judgment?

19             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, it's interesting

20 because they -- in one -- in the assignment part of it

21 they say they are bound, but on the -- on the separate

22 set of the agreement it talks about the reasonable

23 discretion of the assignor -- assignee.  So the

24 agreement is, to my mind, inherently contradictory as to

25 what are the obligations.



Official - Subject to Final Review

Alderson Reporting Company

61

1             JUSTICE STEVENS:  Which -- the assignees,

2 but the assignors have agreed to be bound --

3             MR. PHILLIPS:  Well, if it's reasonable --

4 it says reasonable discretion.  And so the question is,

5 you know, is this -- was that an exercise of reasonable

6 discretion?  And I don't know the answer to that in any

7 given case.

8             And I think part of the -- Justice Kennedy

9 and Justice Breyer, you asked the question about above

10 and beyond discovery, what are the other problems that

11 arise when you go down this -- and the more -- the other

12 one is that being bound by the judgment.

13             If you have a complete assignment of the

14 chosen action, the assignee, then, is completely bound.

15 There is nothing left.  The assignor has no rights left.

16 There is nothing left for the assignor to do in that

17 situation; whereas, in these kinds of situations where

18 the assignee receives the right to go forward but the

19 remedy is in another party's hands, the potential for

20 being bound is completely lost.

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you,

22 Mr. Phillips.  The case is submitted.

23             (Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the hearing in 

24 the above-entitled matter was submitted.)
