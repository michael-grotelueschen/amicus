CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 11-1160, the Federal Trade 

Commission v. Phoebe Putney Health System. 

Mr. Horwich? 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. HORWICH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

The State Action Doctrine provides a defense 

to a Federal antitrust suit when a State has clearly 

articulated and affirmatively expressed an intent to 

displace competition with respect to the particular 

activity at issue in the suit. 

Now, in practical terms, what that comes 

down to is whether application of Federal competition 

law would somehow subvert a sovereign State policy 

choice that's clearly evident in State law. 

Now, that policy might be expressed in 

mandatory or compulsory terms, but, short of that, it 

would also be enough, if the -- the State had 

specifically permitted conduct that is inherently 

anticompetitive. 

But a grant of general power to act -Â­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You don't think that the 

grant of powers in this case would permit the hospital 

authorities, the corporation, to set prices for their 

services that are below the competitive prices in order 

to serve the needy? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, Justice --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Isn't that inherent in 

the regulations? 

MR. HORWICH: I think it is, although for 

reasons that don't affect the analysis of the question 

about an anticompetitive acquisition. And let me 

explain why the analysis might be different with respect 

to prices. 

There is specific authorization in the 

statute for the hospital authorities, in conjunction 

with the counties, to partly fund -- or, I guess, 

entirely, in principle -- fund their services through 

tax revenues. So they have another source of funding 

that would allow them to price in ways that a 

competitive actor would not necessarily price its 

services. 

So if we're talking about particular pricing 

decisions, say -- I guess it would be below cost pricing 

that is alleged to somehow be anticompetitive -- then 

there might very well be a State action defense to that

because it -- because the State -- the power to price 

services subsidized in a way that an ordinary actor 

wouldn't be able to do --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have --

MR. HORWICH: -- might very well displace 

competition in that regard. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any cases in 

which we -- we slice it that fine --

MR. HORWICH: Well, I do think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that -- that you are a 

State actor for some anticompetitive purposes and not 

for others? 

MR. HORWICH: Yeah, absolutely, 

Justice Scalia. I think -- I think the best -- the best 

example comes from Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar. So, 

in that case, the -- the issue was a challenge to a 

practice of minimum fee schedules that were set by --

not by the State, but -- but agreed upon by a bar 

organization. 

Now, the State in that case, of course, 

regulated the practice of law. It regulated admission 

into the practice of law. It regulated certain aspects 

of the conduct of the practice of law. And this Court 

held, in Bates v. Arizona State Bar, that those sort of 

regulations do constitute State action.

But the Court did not accept the submission 

that the State action defense covered the setting of 

minimum prices that was at issue in that case because 

that was not something that there was State action over. 

And as a -- and, taking a step back, the 

justification for the State Action Doctrine is that the 

State is trying to pursue some policy that is part of 

its traditional sovereign prerogatives to regulate its 

own economy and that Federal law was not understood to 

intrude upon that. 

But, if the State is not actually trying to 

advance some other policy, with respect to the 

particular conduct at issue, then it can't be said that 

the State has done something that Federal law should 

stand aside for. 

The -- the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Horwich, you said 

in -- in your reply brief that, if the Hospital 

Authorities Law specifically authorized local hospital 

authorities to acquire any and all hospitals within 

their geographic area, then the clear articulation 

requirement would be satisfied. 

But the Authorities Law does authorize the 

acquisition of other hospitals. And it doesn't say one 

or two; it says other -- other facilities.

So why doesn't the hospital laws law do 

exactly what you said would satisfy the -- the clear 

articulation requirement? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I think the key 

difference there, Justice Ginsburg, between the 

hypothetical we offered in the -- the reply brief and 

the statute here is that the -- the additional words 

"any and all" make it clear that the State is 

contemplating that there could -- the county might opt 

for socializing its hospital services, putting all of 

them under the control of the hospital authority. 

And, by contrast, what we have here is an 

ordinary corporate power to acquire property. And, like 

all of the ordinary corporate powers that the authority 

possesses that are -- that resemble those that -- that 

an ordinary business corporation would have, the most 

natural understanding of them is that the State expects 

them to be exercised in conformity with the background 

principles that -- that bind everybody. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just so I understand 

your answer to Justice Ginsburg, you're saying there 

would be a difference if the charter said the authority 

may require -- acquire any properties to fulfill its 

mission and if it said the authority may acquire 

properties to promote its mission?

MR. HORWICH: Well, I think it's probably in 

our -- the hypothetical offered in our reply brief, it's 

probably the "all" -- the "any and all" that -- that 

would, I think, be what communicates the State's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think a 

general saying they may acquire properties doesn't 

implicitly say they may acquire all properties? 

That seems a pretty thin --

MR. HORWICH: No, I don't think it does --

well -- but I think, in this area, it's -- it's 

important, for a couple reasons, that we actually 

have -- have some substantial assurance of what the 

State is trying to do here. 

And a power to grant proper -- excuse me --

a power to acquire properties, generally speaking, 

unadorned with any particular expression from the State 

about how -- how that power is to be used, is -- is 

something that can be used competitively or 

anticompetitively. 

And you can't infer from that that the State 

really has an objective of, as I say, such as 

socializing its hospital services because -- and -- and 

it's -- and that clarity of expression from the State is 

really important here, for several reasons. 

First of all, this is an odd rule, to begin

with, in that it allows State law to displace Federal 

law. So we would want some clarity from --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume -- I assume that 

the normal corporate charter contains such a provision, 

the authority to acquire property, right? 

MR. HORWICH: Yeah, it absolutely does. 

And --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And we don't -- that --

that charter is issued by the State, right? 

MR. HORWICH: It is issued by the State. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And we don't -- we don't 

think that that enables all corporations to ignore the 

Sherman Act, do we? 

MR. HORWICH: No, we don't. And we don't 

generally think that those corporate powers express an 

intent to displace any other background --

if I could give some examples, maybe we could look at 

some --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Horwich, could I just --

MR. HORWICH: Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- before you give examples, 

just make sure I understand your basic position? 

Suppose the State had said, very clearly, 

that these hospital authorities had the power to engage 

in acquisitions of hospitals that, for a normal actor,

would violate the antitrust laws, but -- but basically 

said the -- the hospital authorities had the discretion 

to do that or not. 

And the State didn't know the hospital 

authority might do it, but it also might not do it. 

That would be subject to the immunity; is that correct? 

MR. HORWICH: I -- I think the defense would 

be available if -- if the beginning of your hypothetical 

was kind of quoting the statute, yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. It's a clear grant of 

authority --

MR. HORWICH: Yes. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: But the authority is 

completely discretionary. So the State is basically 

saying, we don't know, we're going to let the hospital 

authority figure it out. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, it's certainly -- the 

hospital authority can figure it -- figure out, but what 

it's figuring out is whether to actually invoke a 

displacement of competition that the State has expressly 

put on the table. And that's what is different in this 

case --

JUSTICE KAGAN: What -- but what I'm trying 

to get at is the State has put it on the table only as a 

completely discretionary action. The State has not

expressed a preference for it. 

The State has only said that the hospital 

authority can think about conditions on the ground in 

its particular locality and can decide whether such an 

anticompetitive acquisition is appropriate. 

MR. HORWICH: Yes, that's fine. We don't 

have any quarrel with -- with States setting up a clear 

set of tools, some of which, in your example, might 

inherently displace competition --

JUSTICE KAGAN: So all of this language --

MR. HORWICH: -- and having it exercised, 

actually, at a local level. That's fine. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: So all this language in your 

brief about necessarily and inherently and compelled, 

all of those things really are not part of your -- your 

governing test? 

MR. HORWICH: No. I -- I disagree with 

that. The reason they are part of our governing test is 

this: Is that a State can certainly give a -- a menu of 

specific options that sub-State entities can -- can 

select from. And it might be that some of those are, in 

fact, not anticompetitive. 

Let me give you an example from -- from this 

Court's cases. Southern Motor Carriers involved the 

submission of -- by motor carriers, of their rates to a

public service commission that was -- that would accept 

them as filed rates. 

Now, the States -- some of the States there 

said, well, you can file them individually, or you can 

file them jointly, and we don't necessarily have a 

preference, one way or the other, for it. 

But the fact that the States had said you 

can file them jointly, which is a horizontal agreement 

among competitors and sure looks anticompetitive, the 

fact that the State had said that and put that option on 

the table qualified as a clear articulation from the 

State that it intended the displacement of competition 

to occur if that specific option was chosen. 

The difference here is that, if you are 

willing to say, in a case like what we have here with a 

statute that -- that confers a -- a power that is 

entirely neutral as to how it would be -- how it could 

be exercised, you have the problem of not really knowing 

what the State would intend. And so you can't say that 

the State clearly intended that there be displacement 

of competition --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what about the other? 

The next line that they give is they give to the 

hospital authority the power to acquire and operate 

projects and the power to form and operate one or more

Now, as I read that, it certainly includes 

the rather specific power of acquiring a hospital. And 

having read that -- not -- not just something you might 

see in General Motors' charter. 

MR. HORWICH: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and those -- that's 

the language of the -- of the grant of power. 

Now, I want to know what you want us to do 

because, in my mind, reading this, it's a statute that 

provides for regulation -- price regulation of 

hospitals. And you say -- and I have no doubt you 

thought of one way in which that could be -- I can think 

of 100 -- that you could have prices that are different 

from those set by a free market. So I have no doubt 

that this sets -- I start there. 

Now, what is it -- I go back to 

Justice Scalia's original question: What is it you want 

us to say? Even though this -- this statute is immune, 

does grant immunity from attack on a basis of cost and 

price regulation, it is not immune in respect to 

mergers, okay? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I think --

of about 50 examples, where a merger might be 

anticompetitive, and yet, it would lead to lower prices. 

And the Department of Justice might attack it, but this 

statute -- and that's what's bothering me -- seems to 

want to further that kind of thing. 

MR. HORWICH: Well, I --

JUSTICE BREYER: That -- that's where I am, 

and I -- I'm not at all decided. 

MR. HORWICH: Sure. Well, I guess I 

would -- I guess I would first point out that -- that 

price competition is not the be-all and end-all of 

anticompetitive consequences, right? 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I think I know that. 

MR. HORWICH: I mean, we have this 

concern -- obviously, we have a concern here that 

without -- and this is detailed, very clearly, in the 

complaint, I mean, I think starting with paragraph --

paragraph 8, that talks about some of the price -- some 

of the pricing constraints. But you get on to the later 

paragraphs of the complaint, you have all these 

descriptions of loss of quality competition here. 

So you have -- you have --

my question, I guess. You have to take as a given that,

statute clearly prohibits the application of the 

antitrust laws to pricing decisions. That's the job of 

the authority. 

Now, if I start with that, then you will 

say, okay, I have to decide against you. Or you might 

say, even so, I win because mergers are different. Now, 

that -- that's what I'm trying to get you to say. 

MR. HORWICH: Yes, and I guess that is what 

I'm -- I guess that is what I'm trying to say, is that 

mergers are different because the challenged 

anticompetitive act here is not a pricing decision by 

the hospitals that --

JUSTICE BREYER: I want to ask you: Why are 

they different? 

MR. HORWICH: They are different --

JUSTICE BREYER: After all, we have, one, 

the specific language I read; and, two, I can think of 

examples where a merger would be anticompetitive under 

the DOJ and your FTC rules --

MR. HORWICH: Yeah.

further the purposes of the statute by lowering the 

cost.

MR. HORWICH: No, I -- well, I don't -- I 

don't know whether that is -- I don't know whether that 

is true or not, but I think -- I think we're relying on 

a more -- I think you can't simply start with the idea 

that, well -- well, you can't start with the premise 

that this act exists to pursue an objective and to 

pursue it at any cost, without regard to whether it 

displaces competition in the market for paid healthcare 

services, without regard to whether it displaces 

competition for quality among these hospitals. 

I mean, on that logic -- and I -- I think it 

might help to look at some of the other powers here. If 

we -- if you go to the back of the government's brief, 

on page 6A, the authority has the power to make and --

and execute contracts. Well, I don't think that that 

implies a privilege to enter price-fixing contracts. 

That's part of the background principles of antitrust 

law. 

I also don't think it implies the power to 

enter contracts against public policy. A State, 

presumably, doesn't wish to abandon that background 

principle, simply because it wants the authority to 

pursue its mission.

MR. HORWICH: Exactly. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the fact that you 

have examples where you might conclude, no, they didn't 

mean to do that, doesn't seem to categorically suggest 

that you prevail with respect to another one of the 

powers that are granted. 

MR. HORWICH: No, I agree with that, that it 

doesn't categorically, but it does -- it does seem to me 

that -- that if we're looking through this list of 

powers that -- that the hospital authority has, there is 

not anything meaningfully different about the power to 

acquire -- acquire property versus make contracts 

versus, as Justice Scalia said, any other powers that 

are -- that exist in a general corporation's business 

charter. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- this may be 

completely wrong. You can tell me. I would -- would 

doubt that, in counties or municipalities of this size, 

you are going to have -- you know, five hospitals, and 

so that a -- the authority could acquire a hospital and 

yet still it not have any significant merger 

consequences on its face.

giving them the power to acquire hospitals, wasn't it 

the case that there would likely be only one other 

hospital or two, so that any acquisition of another 

hospital would have the merger consequences that this 

one had? 

MR. HORWICH: Well, no, because I think 

the -- the baseline when the statute was enacted was 

that the hospital authorities didn't even exist. So 

they didn't own any hospitals. 

And the first acquisition of a hospital 

can't raise a competitive concern because it's not 

concentrating the market in any way. It's simply 

transferring ownership of the hospital from one actor to 

another. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but to -- to follow 

the Chief Justice's question, suppose it were shown that 

there were many rural counties -- rural areas in 

Georgia, very much like this one. Would that change 

this case? I thought that was the purport of the -- the 

thrust of the question. 

MR. HORWICH: I think you'd have to imagine 

a very stylized hypothetical, to see that the State had 

clearly intended to displace competition. You would 

want to see, for example -- let me give you an 

example -Â­

MR. HORWICH: Well, right, but I suppose 

that -- that guesswork is not going to be a basis 

for saying a State has clearly intended to displace 

competition. 

The situation in which I think you might 

recognize it is, if the hospital authorities were 

already in existence, but they -- and they all each 

owned a hospital, but they had never had the power to 

acquire a hospital, and you knew that they were all --

that each of them had their neighboring competitor, and 

then the legislature comes in and says -- you know, 

we -- we would like you now to actually be able to 

acquire -- acquire additional hospitals. 

I mean, the power here is not the power to 

acquire additional hospitals. But, if the legislature 

had said, we have the power to acquire additional 

hospitals and we know you already have one and we know 

that the one you are going to acquire is going to be 

your neighbor and we know there is not lots of hospitals

defined to include hospitals." So -- so what about 

those words? Why aren't they good enough?

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm looking at 

Section 30 -- well, where are we? 31-7-75(3). 

MR. HORWICH: Right. And so I think what 

you are referring to is number -- number 27 on the list. 

And -- and I think, in the healthcare 

industry, the idea of forming a network is not the idea 

of socializing all of the available resources under 

government control. A network is an integrated system 

where you can go to the hospital for your emergency 

care, and they can refer you to an outpatient clinic 

that they have somewhere else, and there is a physician

I want to be clear about --

JUSTICE BREYER: How is that? 

MR. HORWICH: -- the point. The point of 

this law is to grant counties the opportunity to 

participate in this market by providing care to 

indigents. 

This is not a law about public utility 

regulation. If you think that this is a law about 

public utility regulation, that all hospitals 

are supposed to be -- that the State intends counties to 

be able to elect to put all hospitals under their 

control and -- and manage them as such and manage them 

in the way that a -- that a public service commission 

would regulate all of the utilities --

MR. HORWICH: Well, this -- the authority

authority does not have the power to establish rates at 

private hospitals. And that -- that would be a signal 

difference between the -- the authority's power in

regulator over a -- over a utility. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what does it mean to

authority, yes, but not other hospitals within the

the authority itself is -- is operating.

the idea that the choice that the State is offering is 

no choice at all, if Federal law is going to come in; 

that -- that Federal law would just negate the choice. 

So to be concrete about this, in -- in 

Hallie, for example, the choice that the State provided 

at the end of kind of a complicated line of -- of 

statutory rules about how -- how cities do or don't have 

to provide their sewage treatments to -- to their 

neighbors, at the end of the day the city had a choice 

to say, fine, we will give you sewage treatment 

services, but you have to be annexed to us and -- you 

know, take the other things that come with annexation to 

the city. 

Now, if that choice is -- is -- if that 

choice is anticompetitive, it's going to be taken away 

by Federal law. And the choice that the State has tried 

to offer is no choice at all. It's going to be negated, 

and the only choice left for the -- the city in Hallie 

is going to be to -- to opt --

12 not a clear articulation problem because it's plenty 

13 clear what the State's trying to do. 

14  There might be what I would call an 

affirmative expression problem there because simply 

16 saying that the State doesn't want the antitrust laws to 

17 apply, that's not the basis in federalism for the -- for

has made some affirmative choice that it wants to 

21 accomplish something else, and that it's offered some 

22 principle on which the sub-State actors can -- can act

particular objective that the State was trying to 

pursue.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

local public choice, including the choice to reduce or 

eliminate competition. 

There is no issue here, Justice Scalia, with 

respect to your earlier question, of general corporate 

powers. The Hospital Authorities Law creates local 

public authorities to, quote, "exercise public and 

essential government functions to provide hospital care 

for residents, especially residents who cannot pay. It 

empowers authorities to acquire projects" -- plural --

"specifically including each authority the ability to 

acquire hospitals" -- plural -- but with limitations. 

They have to -- it has to be within a very 

confined geographic and demographic jurisdiction. And 

for authority hospitals, it replaces any pure market 

model with statutory mandates, a mandate to provide 

services to all indigent in the community and to price 

all services on a not-for-profit basis and with a 

statutory limitation on rate of return. 

There are --

are broader than what a corporation may have in certain

complaint and its theory in the district court, which it 

did not pursue in the court of appeals or here, not --

was not that the authorities weren't exercising State 

power, but that the contention that the operation of the 

hospital by the -- the special purpose corporations that 

the hospital authority created was not adequately 

supervised. 

That is what the State was arguing in the 

district court. And when it lost that point, it 

withdrew from the case and has remained absent ever 

since. 

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, we do have a 

brief from quite a number of States, and the brief 

basically says, we do this all the time, we set up these 

local authorities, and then we give them powers because 

they have to act in the world, and we give them normal 

powers, like the ability to make contracts and the 

ability to buy property. 

And when we do that, we don't mean that they 

can do anything they want, notwithstanding the antitrust 

laws. And to construe these very normal powers that we 

would give to a State entity, in order to allow it to 

operate as a permission to violate the antitrust laws, 

is not at all consistent with our own intentions.

amicus brief filed by the States supporting the FTC in 

this case, which is positive, quite expressly and at the 

outset, on an understanding that what is involved here 

is simply a State authorization of creation of a local 

entity with general corporate powers and nothing more. 

That could not be farther from this case. 

These special purpose authorities do not simply have 

general corporate powers. They have a mandate. There 

is a Georgia constitutional amendment that coincided 

with the enactment of the Hospital Authorities Law that 

derogated the State's duty to provide indigent care 

to its -- hospital care to its citizens.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is it a fair 

characterization of your argument -- is it a fair 

characterization of your argument to say that the 

possibility that the hospital authority can use this 

general power in this way is tantamount to or equivalent 

to the legislature intending that it be used that way? 

Is that your argument?

standard that this Court announced in self-consciously 

clarifying the level of explicitness that a legislature 

has to use in Town of Hallie.

derived that formulation expressly from its earlier

reasonably be inferred," quote, "from the authority 

given a local entity to operate in a given area that the 

legislature contemplated the kind of action complained

In other words, as I understand this Court's 

test, whether what was done by the hospital authority or 

any sub-State entity was foreseeable by a reasonable 

legislator, which in this case is that -- was it 

foreseeable that in -- in pursuing the State-imposed 

mandate to serve the indigent in a -- in a confined

in Georgia, a hospital authority might require market 

power or even a public service monopoly because that --

mandate to a public command, that serving the indigent 

has to override the needs of the majority, in terms of 

price competition. 

MR. WAXMAN: No. I don't -- I don't --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And -- and that -- that 

step -- that further step that the State intended to 

immunize their -- the monopoly power, is the step we are 

trying to find in this grant. And that's what I don't 

see. I see the -- the compulsion to serve the needy. 

MR. WAXMAN: Uh-huh. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I hear that much of 

Georgia is rural, but your adversary says, in most 

instances, there is only one hospital, so the 

municipality's taking it over is not going to be a 

merger issue. To the extent that they step in and take 

over one of two hospitals, there is no merger issue 

because it's only substituting one owner for another. 

This situation, they claim, is a rarity, 

where there are only two or three providers and a 

hospital's going to -- and a public -- a municipality is 

going to then get monopoly power by an acquisition. 

MR. WAXMAN: So, Justice Sotomayor, as to 

your first point, our position is not that the only 

mandate is to serve the indigent. The actual mandate in

provide hospital services for all residents, with a 

particular note to the obligation to serve indigent 

clients. 

Second of all, we are not here to -- I mean, 

I don't know where the government is coming up with its 

speculation that, out of Georgia's -- I think it's 154 

counties, for a population of 10 million people, it is 

the rare instance in which there will be anything other 

than just one or -- you know, a multiplicity of 

hospitals. I mean, the Federal Trade Commission 

guidelines for market concentration is anything up to 

four, four or fewer participants. 

The notion that the legislature, in 1941, 

was providing the express authority to acquire multiple 

hospitals in a single municipality or county was focused 

only on huge metropolises, of which there was only one, 

or on counties that were so small that they couldn't 

otherwise even attempt to support more than one hospital 

is just fanciful; it's made up. 

And --

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Waxman, could -- could I 

understand where you think this expressed approval is 

coming from? Because you said general corporate powers 

is not enough. So the general ability to buy property, 

you said, is insufficient.

Then you have this idea they have a mission. 

But the mission can be accomplished in all kinds of ways 

that are perfectly consistent with the antitrust laws, 

so that doesn't seem to get you all that far. 

So what else have you got to show that the 

State actually thought about this issue and approved 

this power for the hospital authorities? 

MR. WAXMAN: Okay. I mean, for one -- one 

other thing is in Section 7 -- 7-77, as -- as was noted 

before, the authorities are subject to regulation of 

rate of return. Now, if that doesn't bespeak the 

foreseeable consequence of market power, I don't know 

what -- what does. That is the hallmark of a regulated 

public service monopoly or at least the regulation of a 

return by a participant with market power. 

The other thing that exists -- and the 

government pooh-poohs this as somehow not part of the 

Hospital Authorities Law -- is that the Georgia State 

legislature has -- this is -- this law was enacted in 

the backdrop of other laws in which Georgia has quite 

deliberately displaced, quote, "unfettered private 

market competition." 

The certificate of need law is the 

paradigmatic example of the imposition of regulation at 

the expense of free market competition and, in fact -Â­

MR. WAXMAN: No, no, no. Our argument is 

not that the certificate -- that the existence of a 

certificate of need law indicates an intent by the 

legislature to fully displace the antitrust laws with 

respect to anybody else. 

My point is, in the context of other Georgia 

systems that strictly limit entry into -- or expansion 

into these local markets, combined with very severe rate 

restrictions and obligations and mandates to serve --

excuse me. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Your point -- I don't mean 

to interrupt, but the point that he's making in response 

to my earlier questions along these lines, I think, was 

the following: Where do they get their hospitals, these 

authorities? The -- the law sets up a hospital 

authority. All right. Where did they get their 

hospitals? 

MR. WAXMAN: They can -- I mean, the 

legislature permits them to be built, bought --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, do you know what

authorities in Georgia? 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: No, not all of them, but --

7 I now am in a county, and suddenly, I'm the mayor, and I

9 authority. So Joe, I say, you are -- you are the boss, 

you are the hospital authority guy. And he says -- you 

11 are to run the hospital. And he says, what hospital? 

12 We don't have a hospital.

they get their hospitals?

18 the record to indicate where all the hospitals --

them. I just want some rough idea where do they come from.

what is now being challenged. So when the hospital --

there was a public hospital, beginning in 1911, in 

Dougherty County. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MR. WAXMAN: When the State constitution was 

amended to impose on counties the State's obligation to 

provide adequate hospitalization care, it enacted the 

Hospital Authority Law for counties that chose to make 

use of that device, in order to acquit their public 

service mandate. 

And Dougherty County did, soon thereafter --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. 

MR. WAXMAN: -- establish a -- an authority, 

and the assets -- all of the assets and all of the 

operations of the existing hospital, were transferred. 

There then -- and there was a natural monopoly in that 

county. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. I've got it. I've 

got it. Then --

MR. WAXMAN: Then --

MR. WAXMAN: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: These were a group of 

people that ran some hospitals -- some municipal 

hospitals, and now, they can acquire, not just 

general -- I agree with you, it isn't just general. 

They have a lot of power there to acquire other 

hospitals from outside the system. 

But, when they do that, there's no reason to 

think that that gives them the power to acquire it, 

where it's anticompetitive. 

MR. WAXMAN: Well, I think that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, the fact that you can 

regulate your own hospitals, which is one track and one 

group, doesn't say that you have to bring in 

anticompetitive people -- I mean, you have to bring in 

others, where they're anticompetitive. That -- that, I 

think, is his point. 

MR. WAXMAN: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Don't think of it as one 

thing; think of it as two separate systems.

Hospital Authority Law gives the hospital authorities

not arguing that. We're not arguing --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. I know that. But 

once you don't -- once you don't -- he says, you see, 

they don't regulate prices at non-authority hospitals, 

they don't do this for non-authority, they don't do that 

for non-authority, even though they might have the power 

to bring them in; but, when they have the power to bring 

them in, why read this -- it's at least ambiguous -- why 

read this as saying you can bring them in, where it's 

anticompetitive to do so? 

MR. WAXMAN: I mean, this doesn't say, you 

can bring them in where it's anticompetitive to do so. 

That's their any and all hypothetical. And this Court 

has never required, for good reason, express authority. 

That was the whole point of City of Hallie and City of 

Lafayette -- Town of Hallie and City of Lafayette. 

The point here is, okay, so they created a 

hospital authority, it ran a public hospital, it was a 

natural monopoly. The county grew. A private hospital 

developed. The public hospital, which is serving more 

than ten times the number of indigent patients than the 

private hospital, which is very underused, the county 

hospital has been -- the hospital authority has been 

saying, for years and years and years, we need more 

capacity, we need more capacity.

There are -- in order to accomplish our 

mission, there are two ways to do it. We can only 

operate in this confine. We can build a new hospital, 

and here's what it would cost, and here's what we would 

get. And we would, by the way, have to satisfy the 

State authorities that we are entitled to a certificate 

of need in the context in which the private hospital is 

severely underutilized. 

Or we can talk with the private hospital 

about whether they would like to be acquired. And the 

record shows that they did that for many, many years, 

even before the Phoebe Putney entities were created. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Waxman, I'm showing 

my ignorance. Is this -- would this merger be subject

is really more fundamental, which is, yes, I understand 

that you have a great defense, potentially, to a rule of 

reason challenge that -- that there was necessity in its 

truest sense, in its economic sense, in this situation. 

So why should we undo our decades of 

writings that say that we should construe immunity 

narrowly and not broadly, when it comes to displacing 

our antitrust laws? 

MR. WAXMAN: Because the point of State 

action immunity, which is respect for the sovereign 

choices of sovereign States, is -- exists not only to 

provide a -- an ultimate defense in litigation on the 

merits, it's to protect States and sub-State entities 

from the cost of litigating. 

I mean, the question, ultimately, in this 

case -- and in all these cases -- is who gets to decide? 

Who gets to decide if this is reasonable or not?

whether the State has made a choice. And that's what 

all these cases are about --

isn't enough. 

You said a certificate of need, but a 

certificate of need, it isn't even given out by this 

authority. It's something that has nothing to do with 

the powers of this authority. 

Then you said there -- there's some kind of 

a price regulation that happens as to the -- the 

hospitals that the authority owns, but not with respect 

to other hospitals. 

So I guess I'm still looking for the things 

that show that the State has made a choice that it wants

these -- these hospital authorities to be able to make 

anticompetitive purchases. Where do I find that? 

MR. WAXMAN: I may not be able to convince 

you, but let me take another run. I think it's the 

combination because, as this Court has expressed 

repeatedly, it's -- one has to look at the specific 

power granted, which here is the power to acquire 

hospitals within a very circumscribed jurisdiction, in 

the context of the law as a whole. 

The context of the law as a whole here --

and I hope this works for the Court, but if it 

doesn't -- you know, perhaps I am wrong; it certainly 

makes this a stronger case than Hallie -- here, we have 

a law that says counties have the obligation now, unlike 

the State, to provide adequate hospitalization services. 

They will exercise -- what they do is deemed 

to exercise public and essential government function 

within strictly limited areas. And they have the power 

to acquire hospitals in those areas, subject to very 

strict rate of return regulations and very, very strict 

conditions on how they operate those hospitals, 

including the power to lease to an operator for -- in 

order to serve the public mission. 

And they do that against the backdrop of a 

series of -- they have eminent domain power. They can

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman --

MR. WAXMAN: And they do this in a backdrop 

of a State that has -- notwithstanding the advocacy of 

the Federal Trade Commission, has repeatedly 

strengthened, rather than abrogated, a -- a certificate 

of need law that leads --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Waxman, you are 

essentially interpreting the Georgia statute that sets 

up the hospital authority. And you -- you're saying 

this is how we read it. We start with the antitrust 

exemption is for the State, not subdivisions, so the 

State has to give it to the subdivision, for the 

subdivision to have it. 

Could the Federal court have said, 

we -- we'd like to know what the Georgia legislature --

what the Georgia authorities think this statute means? 

So, could a question have been certified -- I don't know 

if Georgia has a certification procedure, but to the 

Georgia Supreme Court, and said, tell us, does this 

statute, is it intended to transfer the State's immunity 

to the locality -- to the local unit?

Justice Ginsburg, I think it's important to recognize 

that the FTC doesn't dispute that the -- that hospital 

authority -- county hospital authorities are, in fact, 

agents or arms of the State --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question is does 

this -- does this legislature mean that the State is 

transferring its immunity to this local unit? 

MR. WAXMAN: And I believe the FTC --

Mr. Horwich can correct me if I'm wrong -- but I believe 

the FTC's position is, generally, yes, but not with 

respect to the -- what is alleged to be a merger to 

monopoly. 

And the question in this case is whether or 

not the acts, under this law and applying the 

foreseeable result standard, whether the acts of the 

hospital authority in this case in approving and 

acquiring the second hospital are fairly attributable to 

the State. 

And if I could just --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Waxman, if you don't 

want to be interrupted, you have to pause between 

sentences.

JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand. That's 

right. 

You've given a -- you know, an appealing 

example of a small county that has one -- one hospital, 

and this operation purchases that one -- one hospital. 

Seems nothing wrong with that; although, as Justice 

Sotomayor suggests, I doubt whether the FTC would be 

pursuing a situation in which there is a natural 

monopoly. It's a question of whether the monopoly would 

be owned by the State or not. 

But your argument, if we follow it, embraces 

a quite different situation, a very large county which 

has five hospitals that are competing vigorously in 

price, in specialties, they advertise on the radio, as 

some hospitals do. 

And what you're saying is that this 

operation can take over all of those hospitals and 

eliminate all of that competition. Isn't that so? 

MR. WAXMAN: Well, I -- for purposes of 

Federal antitrust law, yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

almost certainly no. And the point here is -- and that

fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA: We have no -- we have no

MR. WAXMAN: Oh, yes, we do. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And we have a Federal 

antitrust law. 

MR. WAXMAN: We -- we absolutely do, 

Justice Scalia. There is a solid line of cases in which 

the Georgia Supreme Court has -- has quite rigorously 

enforced the limitations of the Hospital Authority Law, 

in order to prevent hospital authorities from doing 

things that it says the legislature didn't intend. The 

Tift County case is the best example, but there are 

others cited in our brief. 

The last point --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why didn't it intend 

this? I don't understand. You -- you've told us that 

they did intend this, that they did intend to displace 

competition. 

MR. WAXMAN: Yes.

Fulton County -- and I believe there is more than one 

hospital authority in Fulton County, and they are 

authorized to merge, in any event -- but could they 

acquire, by purchase or eminent domain, all of the 

hospitals in metropolitan Atlanta to do so? And my 

point is that for purposes of Federal antitrust law the 

answer is you are out -- that's -- you are not the 

authority to inquire. 

The question is -- just as this Court -- you 

explained for the Court in Omni, there may be very many 

things that a local authority can do that would violate 

State law, and there are State law remedies. And my 

point only was that the Georgia Supreme Court has been 

very quick to enforce the limitations. 

But as a matter of Federal antitrust law, 

the only question is were they -- were they authorized 

to do things like this? And if I --

JUSTICE BREYER: And they -- they say on 

that, that it's a sham. Well, just say 30 seconds on

at any price anywhere, they've never done a single 

thing, it's a sham; and therefore, that's the end of it. 

What about that? 

MR. WAXMAN: Okay. If I can just finish my 

answer to Justice -- I have one other point to make 

for -- to Justice Kagan, who has asked it twice. 

The -- my last point I want to make -- and 

then I will answer this -- is that this county -- this 

hospital authority, like many, facing a capacity 

constraint and a -- and a nondiscretionary mandate to 

serve the public needs for hospitalization, had two 

choices. 

It could have tried to convince the State to 

spend three times as much money to get half the number 

of beds, notwithstanding the existence of excess 

capacity; or it could buy the other hospital and get 

that capacity in a consensual transaction by the 

authority. 

And here's my point, Justice Scalia, this 

case is on all fours with this Court's decision in Omni. 

The notion that this may have long been desired by 

this -- this special-purpose entity is totally 

irrelevant. This -- this acquisition was proposed to, 

considered by, and -- and approved by the hospital 

authority.

And not only that, when the FTC came and 

complained about it, they reconvened another public 

meeting and discussed it again and came to the 

conclusion again that they wanted to acquire this 

hospital. 

And before they signed the lease, they 

issued a notice and comment period. There was three 

months for people to tell the authority whether this 

lease was or was not consistent with community 

interests. They had a public meeting, and they approved 

it. And that is the act of the State. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can the State --

does the State have a procedure where it can give 

real-time approval? In other words, this is going on, 

and the hospital authority says, boy, the FTC is sending 

us these letters. State, could you do something to show 

that you approve this transaction, whether it's a 

special law or there is some organization, I guess, in 

some other case, setup, that could give its approval? 

Is there --

MR. WAXMAN: I mean, this is -- the Hospital 

Authorities Law says, counties, this is your 

responsibility, here are your powers. If anybody in the 

State or any competitor or the attorney general thinks 

that you are abusing those statutory powers, the courts

are open and quite receptive to those concerns. But 

there's no --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I know. But I 

guess my point is can the burden of going forward be 

switched the other way? And can this hospital authority 

say -- you know, to the State, we would like some 

blessing on this, so that we can go ahead with it? 

So the choices aren't really build your own 

hospital or acquire the other one, in the abstract, but 

ask the State -- you know, what do you want us to do? 

Do you want us to build a new hospital? Or is it okay 

if we acquire this one? 

MR. WAXMAN: I don't believe there is any 

such mechanism, and I believe that the -- the State --

the legislature didn't contemplate anything like that, 

because the mandate and the responsibility and the 

authorization was devolved to the counties. 

Now, Mr. Chief Justice, what the -- what the 

hospital authority could do and did do, although it's 

not in the record of this case, is evaluate the 

likelihood of getting a certificate of need to build the 

additional required facilities. 

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. HORWICH: Thank you. 

I guess I -- I heard several members of the 

Court asking Mr. Waxman, specifically, Where do you find 

this? Where can you locate this intent to displace 

competition in the statute? And I would like to just 

run through, if I could, each of his answers and why I 

think they are insufficient. 

So the first one, of course, we've talked a 

lot about the existence of general corporate powers, but 

the most natural inference there is that the State 

expects those to be exercised in conformity with the 

background principles that anybody else who has general 

powers has. 

Now, the idea that the authority has a 

mandate, a purpose it's supposed to serve, of course, 

that's always true. States always have some purpose in 

mind when they set up some sub-State entity. The 

question isn't whether there is particular ends the 

State is trying to pursue. 

The question here is whether the State 

intended to pursue those ends through the particular 

means of displacing competition, here, displacing 

competition in the market for paid healthcare services.

1  And see Mr. Waxman also pointed to the rate of 

2 return provision in the statute. Now, as a sort of a 

3 threshold matter, there's -- if past is prologue, there 

4 is not any reason to think that that will be not be 

rigorously enforced with respect to the privately 

6 controlled operations here. But -- and that's sort of 

7 the second question presented, and we can set that aside 

8 for the moment, I guess. 

9  But it seems to me there are two far more 

natural explanations for the presence of the rate of 

11 return provision in the statute than the one Mr. Waxman 

12 would like you to -- to give to it. 

13  The first explanation is this is a statute 

14 about providing public care for indigents. Nobody 

should be making a profit off of that, and the State 

16 wants to say that. And that seems to be a very natural 

17 explanation that doesn't depend at all on the State 

18 intending to displace competition completely. 

19  The -- the rate -- the price regulation 

provision also can be naturally understood as a response 

21 to the recognition that there will be some de facto 

22 monopolies in the situation where there is only one 

23 hospital in the county. 

24  But it does not mean that the State wants 

there to be more monopolies, so that it can bring in the

unfortunate medicine of rate regulation to respond to 

those. Presumably, the State intends, as is the 

accepted background principle of free market competition 

in this country, that there won't be monopolies, unless 

they -- unless they arise of necessity. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, can I 

interrupt --

MR. HORWICH: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- you, just a moment, 

to address a question raised by Justice Breyer, which is 

your alternative argument? 

MR. HORWICH: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You have lots of 

evidence that the authority does very little oversight 

of these hospitals when they move forward. But is that 

the issue before us? Is the question of immunity as to 

what happens in the operation of the hospital or in 

their merger and acquisition, their actual formation? 

And -- so that to the extent that we were to 

conclude that the State has delegated immunity on the 

basis of merger, why do we need to look any further at 

whether there has or has not been an appropriate degree 

of supervision of that decision? 

MR. HORWICH: Right. Well, the -- the --

I -- I don't think the two are entirely -- are entirely

separable, as a matter of competition law, because the 

reason the competition law is concerned with mergers is 

not because of the transaction as such, but it's because 

of what it does going forward to the structure of the 

market and the competitive behavior of those in the 

market. 

And so the State Action Doctrine says that 

the State -- if the State's going to go create monopoly, 

it needs to take ownership of that monopoly. And I'm 

using ownership not in the literal sense, but at least 

ownership in the sense of actively supervising the 

monopoly, to be sure that it is pursuing the -- the 

objectives that the State has in mind for creating it. 

So that's -- that's why we are still concerned there. 

Mr. Waxman referred to the Certificate of 

Need Law. I think there is a very close analogy to be 

drawn to Goldfarb here. That is the -- the question of 

minimum fee schedules agreed to by lawyers. The State 

of -- the State of Virginia regulated entry into the 

market for the practice of law, just as the certificate 

of need regulates entry into the hospital market. 

But horizontal agreements among people 

already in the market, such as here and such as the 

minimum fee schedule in Goldfarb, are not exempt just 

because of it.
