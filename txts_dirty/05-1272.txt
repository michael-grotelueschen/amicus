 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in 05-1272, Rockwell International 

Corporation versus United States. 

Ms. Mahoney.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MS. MAHONEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Tenth Circuit in this case correctly 

held that Stone could not share in the award given by 

the jury unless he was an original source of pondcrete 

allegations. But it then went on to find that he was an 

original source based upon a misinterpretation of the 

core requirements of the statutory definition.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Mahoney, let me ask you 

a question. Am I wrong about this? It seems to me that 

if he was not an original source, not only shouldn't he 

get any money, but neither should the government. Isn't 

that the way the statute reads?

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, that is one 

possible interpretation of the statute.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How is there any other 

possible one? It says there's no jurisdiction in this

situation.

 MS. MAHONEY: I think the way that the 

courts have handled it below is that it says that 

there's no jurisdiction unless it is a claim brought by 

a relator who is an original source or if it's brought 

by the United States. And if the relator drops out, I 

think courts deem it to at that point be viewed as a 

claim brought by the United States. It's sort of a 

retroactive amendment of the pleadings.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not brought by the 

United States as long as he's still there.

 MS. MAHONEY: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's your argument.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, it can't be, Your Honor, 

because under the statutory terms, under section 3720(a) 

the Attorney General has the authority to bring a claim 

on behalf of the United States. There is no authority 

for the United States to bring a claim on behalf of the 

relator. Instead there is a second type of claim under 

section 3730, and that's a section (b), which authorizes 

a relator to bring a claim on behalf of himself and the 

United States.

 Similarly, Your Honor, if you look at the 

provisions in section (d), which authorize an award to a 

relator, it requires that the action be one brought

under section (b), that is in other words it be an 

action brought by the relator which the United States 

then proceeds on for (d)(1).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I guess it really depends 

on whether you think the language "if the Government 

proceeds with an action" is equivalent to the 

Government's bringing the action.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, I don't think it can be, 

Your Honor, because if you look at the language 

throughout these sections, it differentiates between two 

kinds of actions, actions brought by the United States 

or the Attorney General and actions brought by the 

relator. And it is only an action brought by the 

relator under section (b) that authorizes an award under 

section (d). And it consistently talks about that.

 What they're really arguing, Your Honor, is 

that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, wait. It says under 

3, what is it, (c)(3) I guess, if the elects not to 

proceed with the action, the person who initiated the 

action shall have the right to conduct the action. Now, 

that suggests that if the Government intervenes the 

Government is proceeding with the action, right?

 MS. MAHONEY: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you say that's

different from the Government bringing the action.

 MS. MAHONEY: Absolutely. If you look at, 

if you look at the language in section (d), for 

instance, it says if the government proceeds with an 

action brought by a person under section, subsection 

(b). In other words, it has to be an action under 

subsection (b) in order to authorize an award at all. 

The Government has -- has authority under subsection (a) 

to bring an action, but it has no authority to bring it 

on behalf of the relator.

 The statute consistently uses these same 

terms, and this Court in Graham County, which was a 

decision dealing with the statute of limitations, 

actually described this section in the same way, saying 

that there are two kinds of actions, those that are 

brought by the Attorney General under subsection (a) and 

those that are brought by a relator under subsection 

(b), which the United States can then proceed with.

 What the relator is really arguing here is 

that if you look at the -- at subsection (e)(4), they're 

adding a phrase that's not there. They're saying that 

there's no jurisdiction over an action under this 

section if it is brought by the Attorney General or 

brought by a relator who is an original source or the 

United States intervenes and proceeds with the action.

And that's not in here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're being very 

picky-picky with this text, considering that you're 

willing to swallow whole the notion that so long as 

the -- so long as the original party, so long as the 

non-government plaintiff drops out, all of a sudden it 

become as action brought by the United States. That's a 

very, very expansive notion of what "brought by the 

United States" means.

 What I'm saying is or, to put it another 

way, if you take your picky-picky notion of being 

brought by the United States, to be logical about it you 

must reach the conclusion that if you defeat the private 

plaintiff under -- under he's not original source, the 

whole thing is thrown out, not just his recovery but the 

Government's recovery.

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, of course that 

would be great for Rockwell, and so --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I know, but it would be so 

extreme that we're not likely to buy it.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, we don't argue for that 

because I think that the Court has said that the 

Government's intervention does not cure defects with 

respect to the relator, and therefore, if the relator 

didn't have -- that -- doesn't have standing -- you

know, part of this goes to the issue of the Stevens 

assignment. If they don't have an assignment, then they 

don't even have standing to be in the action, they have 

no right to recover.

 And so if you're correct that it can't be 

cured, in effect, through a procedure like, say, 28 

U.S.C. section 1553, which allows amendments to 

defective jurisdictional allegations where I think that, 

while the courts don't technically require it, they 

could say that really this, while it was pled as a 

section (b) action, when the relator drops out we could 

treat it as a section (a) action, because --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Otherwise, the Attorney 

General could just bring it all over again, a fresh 

complaint, and that would be wasted motion?

 MS. MAHONEY: That's correct, Your Honor. I 

think it is a pragmatic rule. But again, if the rule is 

that they lose as well, then so be it. The fact is this 

statute uses the term that is used in section (a), which 

is "brought by the United States." And it makes perfect 

sense because otherwise think of what the consequences 

are if the relator can simply copy an indictment, file a 

complaint, and say -- and the Government intervenes 

because it's a major action, and then they say, aha, 

you're stuck with me because you've intervened and now

there's jurisdiction and there's no problem, I don't 

have to be an original source.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They don't have to give 

them any money, though. The court doesn't have to.

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, I think that you 

could say that they don't have to give them money.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But you'd then have to pay 

his attorneys' fees. That's what really this is about, 

isn't it?

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, it is about that, but we 

don't have to pay his attorneys' fees, Your Honor, if he 

doesn't get a share, because the way that section (d) is 

written is it says that a relator who is paid a share of 

the proceeds shall also be entitled to attorneys' fees. 

So this is not just an issue between the United States 

and Stone. The statute controls the award of fees based 

upon whether he's entitled to a share. So even if this 

weren't an issue of jurisdiction, if he's not entitled 

to a share under a section (d)(1), then he's also not 

entitled to attorneys' fees. And therefore, we would 

win. He would still need to -- whether it's a 

jurisdictional rule or a substantive rule, if he's not 

an original source he's out.

 But the share is not the only issue that 

makes the Government's -- or that makes Stone's argument

implausible here. That is that once the relator is in 

the action, the United States can't get them out of the 

action. Even if they don't have to pay them money, 

under subsection (c) they have a whole range of rights 

to participate in the action. They can't dismiss the 

relator. So it makes no sense to read this statute to 

say that someone who copies an indictment, files a 

complaint, the Government intervenes, they're in there 

forever. It instead makes much more sense to read the 

terms the way they're used elsewhere in the statute, to 

mean that there is only jurisdiction if it is a section 

(a) claim brought by the United States on behalf of 

itself or if it is a section b) claim by a relator that 

is an original source. That's what makes sense of the 

statute as a whole.

 If I could turn to the issue of whether or 

not the Tenth Circuit correctly held that Stone had 

direct and independent knowledge of the information on 

which his allegations were based. It bears emphasis 

that every act that he had to prove in order to recover 

on the pondcrete allegations -- whether they're measured 

at the beginning of the case or the end of the case 

doesn't matter -- every single act occurred after he 

left the plaintiff, after he had left his job. And we 

can see that from the outset of the case. If you look

at his Responses to Interrogatories at JA-189 to 190, he 

identifies the factual basis for the pondcrete 

allegations that he is asserting. And that factual 

basis is described he is asserting and that factual 

basis is described as Rockwell's knowing storage of 

pondcrete on outdoor pads at the plant in violation of 

RCRA with false certification from 1987 to 1989.

 Now, he left his job in March of 1986. How 

could he possibly have direct and independent knowledge 

of those predicate acts?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose a company 

has a plan to defraud the Government and it use a 

certain chemical mix to save money and that's what the 

real fraud is. And it puts it in place and it puts it 

in place in 1988. And the -- and it has just two 

containers full of this. And the relator knows about 

it. The relator then quits. Then for 10 years the 

company does the same thing, following the same 

patterns, same method, same improper formula.

 And he then rings -- he then brings this to 

the attention of the Government in the proper way and 

files a suit. He cannot recover for the later action 

which was the same pattern, practice?

 MS. MAHONEY: Perhaps, Your Honor, in 

certain circumstances. I think the key question is

what's the standard, and he has to have substantial 

knowledge about core fraudulent acts. And it may be 

reasonable in your hypothetical or some others to infer 

that he knew plenty about this fraudulent conduct and 

had plenty of reason to conclude that it was continuing 

on.

 But here, Your Honor, nothing of the kind 

happened. He didn't know about any fraudulent conduct 

pertaining to pondcrete before he left. And In fact, 

his allegations start in 1987. He does not say that 

there were pondcrete violations before then and indeed 

there were not.

 The reason there weren't is because when he 

was at the plant Rockwell was producing hard pondcrete, 

hard pondcrete, and it wasn't storing it on site, it was 

shipping it to Nevada. So he couldn't -- and it wasn't 

even clear that it was subject to RCRA because DOE 

didn't enter into a RCRA compliance agreement until 

after he left.

 He also concedes in his deposition that he 

was not, except with one exception -- he was not aware 

of any time when Rockwell affirmatively represented that 

it was in compliance with environmental safety and 

health provisions when it was not. That's JA-106. So 

he didn't -- unlike your hypothetical, he didn't know

anything about there being a pondcrete fraud prior to 

the time of his departure and doesn't even allege one. 

Instead, what the Tenth Circuit rested upon was the fact 

that he had reviewed a design for making pondcrete 5 

years -- in fact, not for making pondcrete; it was 

actually a design for removing sludge from the ponds --

5 years before any of the events at issue here, and he 

said he predicted there would be a design problem.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It wouldn't have to 

have anything to do with pondcrete at all. The statute 

just says the information on which his allegations are 

based. They don't say the allegations that eventually 

give rise to a recovery.

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, every court that 

has considered that question has said that it has to be 

analyzed on what they call a claim by claim basis. Let 

me explain the reason. First of all, let me explain 

what they mean by claim by claim. They really mean a 

factual theory of falsity, and that it has to be done on 

a claim by claim basis, and here's why --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Factual theory of falsity, 

that doesn't mean anything to me.

 MS. MAHONEY: A theory of falsity. In other 

words, a claim, what is called a claim in these cases in 

the claim by claim analysis is a theory of falsity. In

other words, it's why were -- why was the fraudulent 

claim false? Because there may be a certification, for 

instance, of compliance with let's say all laws and 

there could be five different, completely different fact 

patterns as to why that was false, and the damages might 

be completely differ as well.

 So all of the courts have said that's really 

the way that FCA cases are litigated, that's really what 

we call a claim.

 And then, moving back, if you didn't do it 

on a claim by claim basis, you would allow a relator to 

copy an indictment that he knows nothing about, come to 

court, file it, add one theory that he does know about, 

an overcharge for five dollars on a hammer, say that, 

I'm now entitled to proceed on the whole thing and if 

the Government doesn't intervene I get a minimum of 25 

percent of the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's one way to 

look at it. Another way would be you would allow a 

relator in a situation who alleges a particular fraud 

that causes the government to examine the books and 

uncovers a different fraud to recover on that basis. 

It's an unusual situation to have a jurisdictional 

prerequisite determined only after the case is over.

 MS. MAHONEY: But, Your Honor, it doesn't

have to be determined after the case is over. These 

inquiries should -- it should have been determined here 

as well at the very outset of the case. And it was. It 

was just determined wrong.

 We do not have to show that it was wrong at 

the end of the trial in order to prevail in this case. 

It was wrong at the beginning. The interrogatories --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If you only show 

that it's wrong at the end, you still say that they 

should be thrown out.

 MS. MAHONEY: Yes, we do, Your Honor but it 

is not by any means necessary to the outcome in this 

case. And the reason why I think that you do have to at 

least allow for the possibility of looking at the end of 

the case, whether there is jurisdiction or not, is 

because of the nature of this particular jurisdictional 

bar. This is a jurisdictional bar that turns on the 

nature of the allegations at issue in the case.

 Much like -- I think the Foreign Sovereign 

Immunities Act is a perfect example because it too talks 

about jurisdiction being predicated on, for instance, 

commercial -- claims that are based upon commercial 

activity. Suppose that the plaintiff at the outset of 

the case when the 12(b)(1) motion is filed posits one 

theory of the case that involves a predicate commercial

act. But when it gets to trial he's abandoned that 

theory and now he doesn't have any commercial act. 

Surely the Court would say you have to satisfy 

jurisdiction over the theory that has actually gone to 

trial.

 This statute is very much the same. And it 

should not be read in a way that allows relators to 

simply disguise the true basis of their claims, hide the 

relevance of the public information, and then just shift 

gears when you get to trial.

 But here again, if we just look at the very 

beginning of the case, he does identify in those 

interrogatory responses, for instance, what the factual 

basis for the pondcrete allegations are. All that 

factual basis is all identified as -- as core acts that 

occurred after he left the plant. So we can look back 

in this case and say that the trial court erred at the 

outset by not dismissing this portion of his claim as 

well as, in fact, should have dismissed the whole thing, 

Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, his allegation 

was that this, the design is not going to work.

 MS. MAHONEY: But Your Honor --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's not an 

allegation that's -- I mean, it is either true or it's

not true. The fact that you find out after he's left, 

after he's been terminated, that it doesn't work, I 

don't see how that should affect the validity of his 

allegations.

 MS. MAHONEY: Because, Your Honor, this, 

this is a statute about fraud. It's not a statute 

that's violated because Rockwell may have had a 

suboptimal pipe. That's not, that's not even the RCRA 

violation. That's not -- and it is certainly not a 

False Claims Act violation. They weren't selling 

pondcrete to the United States. He didn't know about a 

plan to defraud the United States.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They were certifying 

their compliance with the applicable laws --

MS. MAHONEY: At that, at the time --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- based upon their 

pondcrete design.

 MS. MAHONEY: At the time that he was there 

that was not actually -- he didn't even allege that he 

knew they were doing that with respect to pondcrete. He 

didn't allege that there were any problems with respect 

to the pondcrete production or, or certifications during 

his tenure. From -- they began producing pondcrete in 

1985, Your Honor. And there were no problems that were 

alleged with respect to that pondcrete.

His claim by his own admission starts in 

1987, after he was gone. And again, the mere fact that 

there may have been a defective pipe wouldn't establish 

the RCRA violation, because what they had to show by 

their owning pleading here was that they were storing it 

on site, that it was actually leaking, and, of course, 

the mere fact there may have been a problem with the 

pipe doesn't mean it is actually going to leak, because 

they can fix it in a variety of ways. They can add more 

cement, they can put it in metal containers, they can do 

a myriad of things.

 He didn't even say he knew know that there 

was a plan to not remedy and problems in the design that 

he had identified if and when there became a problem 

with it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Am, am I correct that they 

were, in fact, using that same pipe or that same pipe 

system during a period when perfectly fine cement blocks 

were being produced?

 MS. MAHONEY: We think that's correct, Your 

Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that true, is that 

conceded?

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, I think that it's 

conceded that -- well, their own counsels told the jury

that they were making it wrong, they weren't adding 

enough cement, that that was the reason that it was 

failing; and the Government told the jury that they were 

making it fine until they reduced the ratio of cement. 

So yes, I think it is correct that it has been conceded 

at trial that the system was working fine as long as 

they were adding enough cement.

 But instead what happens after he left --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The whole purpose, 

the whole purpose of this legislation is to ferret out 

fraud on the Government. I mean, if he makes an 

allegation that this design is not going to work, the 

pondcrete is not going to work, and the Government, 

prompted by his lawsuit, investigates it and finds out 

that because of human error they're not making it the 

right way, even if the design does work, he get no 

credit for that?

 MS. MAHONEY: Well, Your Honor, the statute 

isn't written in that way. But let me also call your 

attention to some facts. And that is that a year before 

he brought this claim --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, what about the 

hypothetical? Are you suggesting that in a situation 

like that -- -we'll talk about whether the facts comport 

with it later -- but in a situation like that, he's not

entitled to share in the recovery that the Government 

eventually receives?

 MS. MAHONEY: If -- the mere fact that he is 

a trigger for the Government discovery of a different 

problem, no, that is not a basis for recovery. The 

statute says that if there has been a public disclosure, 

if -- let's assume there was a public disclosure. If 

there's no public disclosure it is no problem. He can 

bring whatever claim he wants. He doesn't have to have 

direct knowledge of it. Bit if there has been a public 

disclosures at that point he has to have direct 

knowledge of the information on which the allegations 

are based. And that has to be a substantial standard. 

Direct knowledge is one of the key things that the Tenth 

Circuit just did not --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You would, you would 

change that to say direct knowledge of the information 

not on which the allegations are based, but on which 

recovery is eventually -- eventually ordered?

 MS. MAHONEY: On which the allegations of 

the claim is based. In other words, it, it's not -- it 

has to be -- and the Government says this as well --

they say under that Section D(1), the relator isn't 

entitled to share in the proceeds of anything that the 

jury gives. The relator is only entitled to share in

the proceeds of a claim for which they were an original 

source or for which they brought the -- brought the 

action under, under Section B.

 Sometimes the Government intervenes and adds 

its own claims not on behalf of the relator, because it 

doesn't have authority on behalf of the relator, and it 

takes the position, I think correctly, that the relator 

isn't entitled to a share in those circumstances.

 And Your Honor, this -- the courts have 

identified all the ways in which this statute doesn't 

make any sense if it is looked at on --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Identified them all?

 MS. MAHONEY: -- on a global basis. Excuse 

me?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: They've identified 

them all already?

 (Laughter.)

 MS. MAHONEY: No, I don't think they have 

identified them all. But I --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You may find another one.

 MS. MAHONEY: I, I would also -- again, it 

would allow the relator to get, you know, a share of, 

when the Government doesn't intervene, a minimum of 25 

percent of a billion dollar recovery after a public 

disclosure that he knew nothing about, if he just knew

one little piece after separate theory of fraud.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the theory is not 

necessarily bad. The, the relator has to cooperate with 

the Government, ideally he should. And if the 

Government said we prefer a variance of your theory, and 

the relator said fine, "I don't want to put competing 

theories before the jury, so I'll surrender my first 

theory and go with the Government's," why should the 

relator be penalized for that good litigation practice? 

It doesn't necessarily mean that the original complaint 

is no good or even that it might not have been proved, 

if the Government had preferred another route.

 MS. MAHONEY: Well it there, if there's a 

minor variation, you know, something like that, I 

certainly don't think that disqualifies the relator 

from, from being an original source. And again, here he 

wasn't an original source even under his own theory at 

the outset of the case.

 What happened at trial is the one little 

thing that he knew or claimed to know, his prediction 

that a pipe would have a problem five years before, was 

dropped completely from the case. So he went from being 

a relator who knew something very small about the case 

or about the theories to nothing at all. It was never 

good enough, but certainly once, once that theory was --

once that piece of information dropped out, it just 

demonstrated, it just highlights that he's not an 

original source.

 And Your Honor, here it wasn't just that 

they didn't want to use that bit of evidence. It was 

actually inconsistent with the theory that they, that 

they pressed with the jury. They said the equipment was 

fine. Rockwell was making pondcrete just fine from 1985 

forward until it stopped adding the cement.

 And that's what they -- that's the theory 

they went with. But again, measure it at the outset of 

the case, and he still wasn't an original source.

 If I could save the remainder of my time?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask just one quick 

question?

 MS. MAHONEY: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What was the public 

disclosure of the claim that ultimately prevailed?

 MS. MAHONEY: The public -- there -- the 

public disclosure was in 19 -- it can be from several 

pieces. But in 1988, there were widely covered stories 

of the fact that pondcrete was being stored at Rocky 

Flats on outdoor pads, that it was leaking and that the 

reason it was occurring was because the employees had 

reduced the ratio of cement.

JUSTICE STEVENS: And the public disclosure

Government proceeding?

 MS. MAHONEY: That's correct. It was in the 

newspapers. But it was definitely covered, Your Honor. 

And that was more than a year before he brought his 

action. And then in addition, there were disclosures of 

allegations of performance bonuses being paid based upon 

falsified evaluations. That's JA 143.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARIA T. VULLO,

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT STONE

 MS. VULLO: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court.

 The Court should affirm the decision of the 

Court of Appeals because as the Government recognizes, 

Mr. Stone is an original source. And it is important to 

the look at the statute and its purpose. The original 

source provision is intended to determine who may bring 

a claim on behalf of the United States Government. And

the recovery provision, 3730(d)(1), determines how much 

if anything a relator may share in the Government's 

recovery. In this case, whether where the Government 

fully supports the relator, I would submit that the 

interests of the statute and the interests of the United 

States are fully satisfied.

 And that is because Mr. Stone is the 

paradigm not parasitic relator. He had knowledge 

firsthand from his six years at Rockwell of a pattern, 

Justice Kennedy, a pattern of criminal conduct and a 

pattern of Rockwell concealing that information.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Unfortunately, it was not 

the criminal conduct that was ultimately -- it was not 

the manner of criminal conduct that was ultimately the 

basis on which the Government proceeded? He knew about 

this bad pipe, right? Or he said that this was a bad 

pipe system? He didn't say anything as I understand it 

about their not adding enough cement which is the theory 

that went to the jury.

 MS. VULLO: Justice Scalia, I would beg to 

differ on that. Mr. Stone in his affidavit at 179 in 

the joint appendix and also in his disclosure statement, 

which is at 29 -- I'm sorry, 174 and 175 of the joint 

appendix, and the disclosure statement at 290, what he 

described was a defective design of the system for

taking the sludge out of the pond. And what he 

specifically said -- and this is very important -- what 

he specifically said was when you took the sludge out of 

the ponds in that manner, it was going to have too much 

liquid, and it was going to lead to deterioration of the 

environment. He said that in the very beginning of the 

case. And at trial, what the testimony was -- and I 

would direct the Court to Mr. Freibach's testimony at 

joint appendix 522, as well as at the trial transcript 

at 987, the issue there was the variability of the 

sludge which may have caused greater inspections and may 

have required additional cement.

 And what is very important is even 

Mr. Freibach who is the first foreman, on whom 

petitioners rely, he testified that during his tenure, 

the variation of the sludge required between 200 and 350 

pounds of cement. That's at the trial transcript at 987 

and the joint appendix at 522.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah. Let me -- let me 

look at what -- let me look at 175. This is, this what 

he says. "After careful study, I concluded that the 

suggested process" -- this means of piping the sludge 

out -- "would result in an unstable mixture that would 

later deteriorate and cause unwanted release of toxic 

wastes to the environment. I also noted based on my

analysis of chemical processes at Rocky Flats that that 

the sludge and liquid present in the -- present in the 

evaporation ponds contained some of the most toxic and 

radioactive substances at Rocky Flats."

 I mean, that's all very good, but it has 

nothing to do with what this company was convicted of, 

which is not -- cutting down on the amount of cement it 

was adding.

 MS. VULLO: That's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: During a certain period 

after this it was creating perfectly good blocks by 

adding more cement. Then they got a new manager who 

said let's use less cement. And that's when they 

started producing the defective blocks. It has nothing 

to do with his allegations.

 MS. VULLO: Justice Scalia, two important 

points. First is that neither the criminal conviction 

nor the jury's verdict determined the cause of 

insolidity. The issue in the criminal case and the 

issue in the False Claims Act case as to pondcrete was 

that the pondcrete was insolid and they were lying to 

the -- the Government about that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And why did the government 

claim it was insolid? What was the claim made for -- as 

to the reason for the insolidity?

MS. VULLO: Your Honor, one of the pieces of 

evidence -- and I would -- out of 55 witnesses and 500 

documents, was that there were certain people who were 

using too little cement. There was also evidence --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but was the reason they 

were using too little cement, the reason that there was 

a variation in the amount of liquid being taken out with 

the sludge as you've described to us that he had 

claimed, or was the reason simply that there was a kind 

of standard ratio of cement to sludge and that standard 

ratio was not followed in the later cases?

 In other words, is it because there was such 

a tremendous variation in the liquid in the sludge or 

simply because there was a standard formula having no 

particular relationship to the liquid in the sludge, and 

they simply didn't follow the standard formula? I 

thought the government's theory was the latter, and if 

it was the latter, it has nothing to do with the claim 

that he was making that there was too much variation in 

the amount of liquid in the sludge.

 MS. VULLO: That's not correct, 

Justice Souter. The reason for the variation and the 

need for additional cement was because the sludge had 

variations and there was too much liquid in it, which 

was precisely what Mr. Stone said. And every one of the

witnesses testified to huge variation of the liquid 

content in the sludge which required more cement, and 

even the amount of cement that was required was very 

variable.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But if they had followed 

the formula that they followed at the beginning, isn't 

it true that there's no evidence that even these 

variations in the liquid in the sludge would have 

resulted in instable or insolid pondcrete?

 MS. VULLO: No. That's not correct, 

Justice Souter. In fact, there was no particular ratio 

that had to be followed of cement to sludge. There was 

testimony that different individuals who worked on the 

pondcrete used different amounts of cement. And as I 

said --

JUSTICE SOUTER: This was truly even before 

the troubles started, even before the insolid pondcrete?

 MR. STEWART: Yes, Your Honor. Yes, 

Justice Souter. Mr. Freibach, who was the earlier 

foreman, testified that under his watch, he needed 

between 250 and 300 pounds of cement, and that there was 

a constant inconsistency in the sludge content coming 

out of the ponds.

from 175 of the joint appendix, was that introduced at 

the trial?

 MS. VULLO: Mr. Stone did not testify at 

trial.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Was this evidence 

introduced from some other source? Was the jury told 

there was this piping that was taking out too much 

liquid with the sludge? Was the jury told that?

 MS. VULLO: The jury -- Mr. Freibach 

described the process. We did not get into the 

engineering detail, Your Honor, of it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So his central allegation 

was not even placed before the jury?

 MS. VULLO: Your Honor, I would submit to 

you, Justice Scalia, that that wasn't required. What we 

needed to prove --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it is worse than 

that, though.

 This information was not even provided to 

the government, which the statute requires. He not only 

has to have direct and independent knowledge, he has to 

voluntarily provide that to the government. And I 

understand that the Tenth Circuit, to have relied solely 

on the document at joint appendix page 605, that's the 

only thing he provided to the government. And all it

says is that this design will not work. There are a lot 

of things that don't work, but that doesn't mean there's 

fraud on the government. You don't know if they're 

going to fix it, they're going to change it, use a 

different design, not make a claim based on that design. 

Why is that enough to satisfy the statute?

 MS. VULLO: Mr. Chief Justice, the 

voluntarily provides prong requires the relator to be 

honest and truthful and submit all the information he 

has. And Mr. Stone did that and the government has 

never said otherwise. In fact, he met with the FBI 

agent --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But he has to -- if 

the information that he provides isn't direct and 

independent information of the allegations, it would 

seem that the statute is not satisfied.

 MS. VULLO: That is correct, Your Honor, but 

Mr. Stone did have direct and independent knowledge of 

his allegations. And I'd like to go back to the 

discussion with petitioner's counsel as to the 

jurisdictional petition in this statute. There is no 

question that --

the only information on which the Tenth Circuit relied?

 MS. VULLO: That, the Tenth Circuit did rely 

on that document and did not consider any other 

information as a result of its ruling with respect to 

that document. The Tenth Circuit also had before it the 

awards fee documents which Mr. Stone provided to the 

government, and those are at joint appendix 247 to 249. 

It also had Mr. Stone's affidavit when he testified in 

his affidavit as to his meetings with the government, 

and also had additional affidavits --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but this -- he 

has to provide this information before filing an action.

 MS. VULLO: That's correct, Your Honor. And

you agree it was; is that right?

 MS. VULLO: Justice Stevens, we in the 

courts below agreed for purposes of the original source 

provision that there was a public disclosure. I think 

what's important following up on the question --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You agree that it's within 

4(a), that it was an action based on a public disclosure 

of information disclosed in newspapers; is that right?

 MS. VULLO: In newspapers and also the 

criminal investigation, but I think what's important is 

that the standard that Rockwell seeks to have this Court 

adopt would actually require such a great level of 

specificity that is not in the public disclosure at all. 

And I think, Justice Stevens, you asked that precise 

question. The public disclosure was very general. And 

the Tenth Circuit --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I am asking you, really 

what I'm seeking to find out is what is the scope of the 

public disclosure that everyone agrees was made? Was it 

all newspapers?

 MS. VULLO: It was newspapers, and the FBI 

agents' search warrant affidavit was also publicly 

disclosed prior to Mr. Stone's filing of the action.

disclosed in the newspapers, does that fit into one of

the categories of public disclosure mentioned in 4(a)?

 MS. VULLO: Yes. It says news reports in 

that provision of the statute.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And everybody agrees on 

what those news reports contained?

 MS. VULLO: Well, I'm not sure what Rockwell 

agrees, but I could tell Your Honor what I believe those 

news reports said, and they said that there were 

environmental violations. There were some news reports 

in June of 1988 about a spill on the pondcrete pads. 

Not a single one of the news reports about the spill on 

the pondcrete pads described at all any false claim or 

false statement, and neither did the agents' search 

warrant affidavit.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: So you're saying that the 

original source of the information was published?

 MS. VULLO: I don't believe that that's the 

appropriate test. It's not before this Court, but I 

believe that the direct and independent knowledge 

requirement is information on which the allegations are 

based, and the allegations refer to Mr. Stone's 

allegations at the commencement of the action. After 

all, it's a jurisdictional provision, and it should be 

determined at the outset of the action.

the allegations referred to the public disclosure. It 

talks about public disclosure of allegations, and then 

says he has to have direct and independent knowledge of 

the allegations. So I would assume that's the important 

linkage.

 MS. VULLO: Mr. Chief Justice, there is a 

split in the circuits on that issue. The issue was not 

decided by the Court of Appeals and as I understand even 

Rockwell's position, that is not Rockwell's position, 

that Rockwell's position is like our position, that it's 

information in the allegations of the complaint.

 But I would submit that that would make no 

difference in this case because Mr. Stone's knowledge is 

direct and independent of the information in his 

complaint as well as the information in the public 

disclosure. And what is important is that Rockwell is 

asking this Court to adopt the quick trigger that the 

Court of Appeals adopted because that was the Tenth 

Circuit's law on public disclosure. Yet in this case, 

say that Mr. Stone's direct and independent knowledge 

has to be very, very specific. It has to be of the 

particular false statements, and that would eviscerate 

the entire original source rule.

 And if I could just get to the point of the 

jurisdictional issue and why Rockwell's position as to

the trial evidence is wrong, it's wrong for two reasons. 

The first is that the statute speaks in terms of 

allegations. It does not speak in terms of evidence. 

In fact, in the provision E.2, which is a provision 

regarding bringing claims against members of the 

judiciary and members of Congress, Congress said 

information or evidence, but in this provision E.4, 

Congress only said information. So looking at the trial 

evidence would be wrong by virtue of the plain language 

of the statute.

 It also would be wrong as, Mr. Chief 

Justice, you pointed out. Since 1824, I believe this 

Court has held that jurisdiction is determined at the 

time of commencement as of the state of things at that 

time. And as, Justice Ginsburg, you pointed out, it 

would be an inappropriate rule to say that if the 

government decides to refine the allegation, after all, 

it is still a concrete allegation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We've also said that 

jurisdiction must be maintained throughout the case. 

Something like standing. We say standing is examined 

throughout the trial. There's an easier standard at the 

beginning, and then for the complaint; and then for a 

motion to dismiss, a somewhat higher standard; and 

finally, if the facts of -- involving standing are

tried, there's the highest standard at the end of the 

trial.

 I mean, it seems to me jurisdiction has to 

be assured throughout.

 MS. VULLO: Justice Scalia, I think this is 

a jurisdictional provision that Congress created.  We're 

not talking about the Federal question jurisdictional 

statute. But in this provision, just like in the Clean 

Water Act in the Walton case, the statute uses the word 

allegations. As in that case, the statute used the word 

alleged. And the Court held very clearly that you look 

at it as of commencement.

 Now it might be a different case if we had a 

federal question case and the relator or the plaintiff 

withdrew the Federal claim. Then there would be a loss 

of jurisdiction. Here of course, the amended complaint 

satisfied jurisdiction when the government adopted the 

relator's claim.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Ms. Vullo.

and may it please the Court:

 One of the features of this case that may 

appear anomalous is the fact that the government is 

aligned with Stone. That is, it's Rockwell's position 

that the entire recovery in this case should go to the 

United States. It is Stone's position that the recovery 

should be shared with the relator, and the government 

agrees with Stone.

 It might be natural for the Court to wonder, 

why would it be in the government's interest to advocate 

that a share of the money damages in this case should be 

given to a private party. And the reason is that the 

government believes that there are three systemic 

government interests that are implicated by this case 

and that would be endangered if Rockwell's position 

prevailed.

 First, in our view, Stone is precisely the 

type of relator that Congress intended to encourage. 

Stone was somebody who had substantial firsthand 

knowledge of Rockwell's environmental practices and of 

its billing practices, and moreover, Stone was somebody 

who didn't conceal his information from the government.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's all very nice, 

but Congress didn't leave it up to you to decide who 

ought to get rewarded or not. It laid down some textual

conditions in the statute. And unless they are complied 

with, the fact that you think this is the kind of person 

you think ought to get the money is really totally 

irrelevant.

 MR. STEWART: We agree. And as to Stone's 

original complaint, the statute frames the inquiry as 

whether Stone has direct and independent knowledge of 

the information on which the allegations were based. 

And we agree with Rockwell and with Stone that that 

refers to the allegations in his complaint.

 Now the allegations were fairly generalized. 

They didn't refer specifically to pondcrete, and they 

covered a wide range of time, from 1980 through to the 

present, which was 1989 as of the filing of the 

complaint. Stone subsequently submitted a lengthy 

affidavit in which he explained what led him to the 

conclusion that Rockwell was engaged in a systematic 

practice of violating the environmental laws and 

misrepresenting the nature of its compliance to the 

government. That information --

JUSTICE ALITO: What if the defect that he 

identified turns out to be entirely different? What if 

there is no dispute, it's completely different from the 

defects that led to the false claims on which there were 

recovery?

MR. STEWART: I mean, there certainly could 

be a situation in which the government intervenes in a 

suit but files what can be regarded as a substantially 

different claim. For instance, if the government had 

intervened in this suit and had claimed that Rockwell's 

requests for payment were fraudulent because Rockwell 

had misrepresented its compliance with the 

anti-discrimination laws, that would be an example of a 

fundamentally different fraudulent scheme and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Let's take this case. Did 

the government use any of the evidence that Stone 

produced? Did it introduce that affidavit which said 

the pipe wasn't working right? Was that part of the 

evidence?

 MR. STEWART: It didn't introduce the 

engineering report. And I do want to focus on --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what else had he 

provided beyond -- did you use anything that came from 

him?

 MR. STEWART: He had provided substantial 

information about a pattern of concealment of 

environmental violations generally. That at least to 

some extent was responsible for an FBI investigation 

which uncovered further --

anything that he provided you?

 MR. STEWART: We proved essentially the 

state of affairs that he predicted would occur.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Did you use anything he 

provided you in order to prove it?

 MR. STEWART: I'm not aware of anything 

that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, neither am I.

 MR. STEWART: But nevertheless, the relator 

had direct and independent knowledge of the information 

on which his allegations were based.

 And I'd like to focus on this question of 

the cause of the insolidity of the pondcrete because I 

think to regard that as the theory of the government's 

liability really reflects a misunderstanding of the 

False Claims Act. For purposes of the False Claims Act 

counts in this case, it was sufficient for the 

government to prove that the pondcrete in fact failed, 

leaked hazardous substances into the environment, that 

Rockwell was aware that the pondcrete was failing, and 

that Rockwell nevertheless continued to represent that 

it was in compliance with the environmental laws.

 For purposes of proving those allegations, 

it was not necessary for the Government to offer any 

hypothesis as to why the pondcrete failed. It would

have been sufficient to prove that the pondcrete failed 

and that Rockwell knew about it. In fact, I wouldn't 

encourage the Court to read the whole trial transcript, 

but I think if the Court reads the plaintiff's statement 

of claims, which is about 30 pages of the joint appendix 

beginning at JA-463, that summarizes the events that 

Rockwell -- I mean, I'm sorry, that Stone and the United 

States intended to prove at trial, and by far the 

predominant focus is on the fact of pondcrete failures 

and Rockwell's awareness that they had -- that pondcrete 

had failed.

 There were a couple of paragraphs in 

those 30 pages that alluded to the supposition that the 

cause of the failure was inadequate cement content. 

There were also isolated references to that theory at 

trial. But to characterize that as the theory of 

liability I think would be a misconception. The 

Government didn't have to persuade the jury one way or 

the other as to why the pondcrete failed.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How is it possible to say 

that he had direct knowledge of events that occurred 

after he had left Rockwell? I mean, all of this failure 

occurred after he was gone.

 MR. STEWART: But again --

this pipe thing that he predicted would cause a failure, 

not only it was not because of that. But he was gone.

 MR. STEWART: Again, the statute doesn't 

require direct and independent knowledge of the fraud. 

It requires direct and independent knowledge of the 

information on which the allegations were based.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right. And how 

would he know except from published report that these 

blocks were failing?

 MR. STEWART: His basis for making that 

prediction was that he believed that the process would 

malfunction. He was also aware --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But prediction is not 

knowledge. Prediction is not direct knowledge.

 MR. STEWART: I think independent of whether 

there had every been a public disclosure, it would have 

been open to Rockwell to argue in response to the 

original complaint that Stone couldn't consistent with 

Rule 11 make allegations as to what had happened at the 

plant after he left because he no longer had an 

evidentiary basis for doing so. Rockwell could have 

made that argument, again regardless of whether a public 

disclosure had occurred, and the question whether it is 

a permissible inference for a plaintiff to say, I saw 

them committing systematic environmental violations

while I was there and I inferred that the same thing 

would go on after I left -- the question that's a 

permissible inference for a plaintiff in a Federal civil 

action to make is a question to be decided under the 

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The public disclosure 

provision serves a different purpose entirely. It's 

designed for those cases in which the relator has 

sufficient information to file a complaint that complies 

with the federal rules of similar procedure, but that 

information overlaps substantially with information in 

the public domain.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And his sufficient 

information you assert is his prediction that these 

blocks would fail for a reason that turned out not to be 

the reason for their failure. That is what you say is 

his direct knowledge.

 MR. STEWART: That knowledge, but I think 

it's also important to recognize that the original 

complaint was not focused on pondcrete specifically. 

The original complaint alleged more generally that 

Rockwell was engaged in widespread environmental safety 

and health violations and was consistently 

misrepresenting to the Government that it was in 

compliance and -- even though it knew that it was not 

doing so.

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you think relators can 

get part of the Government's recovery even where their 

initial allegations before the Government intervenes 

have nothing whatever to do with the reason the 

Government is ultimately giving money? You think they 

are still entitled to a piece of the pie?

 MR. STEWART: I guess I would -- I would 

disagree with the premise that his reasons had nothing 

whatever to do with why the Government is getting money. 

Again to return to the hypothetical I suggested earlier, 

if the Government then filed --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you don't believe that, 

then. You think that indeed the reason the Government 

was given the money has to be connected with, with his 

allegations? Right?

 MR. STEWART: It has to be connected with 

his allegations. And certainly, if you look at the 

theory of liability that prevailed at trial, namely that 

pondcrete blocks were leaking hazardous substances into 

the environment and Rockwell was nevertheless asking for 

Government funds based on misrepresentations that it was 

in compliance, if you look at that theory of liability 

and then examine Stone's original complaint, clearly 

that theory is logically encompassed within the more 

generalized --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What do you mean by 

connected? Is it -- I got -- I'm getting the sense that 

you think it's enough that he says, look, Rockwell is 

just lying to the Government in this area, and you say 

well -- what if what if you added a count in your 

complaint when you intervene on tax fraud? You found 

out also that they didn't pay taxes. Would he be able 

to recover for that, because, you know, if they're going 

to lie about pondcrete they're going to lie about taxes. 

Is that sufficiently connected?

 MR. STEWART: No, and I think I would put 

that with the hypothetical that I offered about the 

Government adding a claim that Rockwell had 

misrepresented its compliance with the 

antidiscrimination laws. And I think there won't be a 

clear dividing line, but I think this is a line that 

courts have to draw for other purposes as well.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it doesn't 

matter to you if he just, if he's completely wrong? 

Let's say he says -- you have special interrogatories to 

the jury and his allegation has always been the 

pondcrete's going to fail because you're putting in the 

wrong kind of cement. And it turns out it has nothing 

to do with that at all. The jury says, no, that's not 

the reason it failed, it failed for another reason. Is

that a sufficient connection?

 MR. STEWART: I think we would -- I think 

there could still be a sufficient connection even if his 

reason for thinking the pondcrete failed, they all 

turned out to be correct. And again, we would emphasize 

that that's particularly so here because the reason for 

the pondcrete failure was not an element of the claim. 

I mean, imagine if this case had been tried to the jury 

and there had been an established rule in place that if 

the pondcrete was shown to have failed because of a 

defect in the machinery, Stone would get a share, but if 

it was shown to have failed because the human operator 

added too little cement Stone wouldn't get a share. If 

that had been the rule there would have been a clear 

potential for disharmony between the Government and the 

relator. It would have raised exactly the specter that 

Justice Ginsburg alluded to, where the Government 

prefers to emphasize one view of the facts rather than 

another and the defendant is getting in the way by 

suggesting that the relator will be deprived of a share.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Try this hypothetical. The 

relator says: I know that they've been cheating the 

Government because I, I observed the president of the 

company going into a meeting with the chief engineer and 

another person, and at that meeting I suspect they were

devising this scheme to defraud the Government.

 It turns out there was indeed a scheme to 

defraud the Government, but that meeting never occurred. 

It wasn't the president of the company who went into the 

meeting. It was Charlie Chaplin. And the facts are 

totally, totally wrong. Does he get money?

 MR. STEWART: Well, I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Does he get money just 

because he came out with the same charge that the 

Government ultimately proves? Simply because he said 

the company is guilty of cheating the Government, even 

though the facts on which he bases it are entirely 

wrong?

 MR. STEWART: I mean, I need to know more 

about the hypothetical, but my initial reaction is that 

that's a complaint that's easily dismissed based on Rule 

11, leaving aside the question of any public disclosure. 

And I can imagine extreme hypotheticals --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, assume one that just 

gets over the line.

 MR. STEWART: I think if the complaint just 

gets over the line, that is if the evidence in the 

relator's possession is just barely good enough to 

sustain the allegation of fraud or at least to allow the 

suit to go forward, there's no reason to read the public

disclosure --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It turns out to be entirely 

wrong. Turns out to be entirely wrong, so that the only 

reason he believed this company was defrauding the 

Government was absolutely wrong.

 MR. STEWART: I think we would still want to 

compare the nature of the fraud that the Government 

alleged with the nature of the fraud that the relator 

alleged. And obviously this is a question in which the 

Court is going to have to balance competing interests. 

It's possible to come up with hypotheticals in which it 

seems as though the relator has no equitable entitlement 

to a share. The two things we want to emphasize are, 

first, in terms of the way that the lawsuit progresses 

even when the Government doesn't intervene, relators 

once they file suit, if they are allowed to proceed on 

their own, they presumably can take advantage of all of 

the rules of civil procedure. And those include the 

discovery provisions of the Federal Rules.

 And it would obviously be self-defeating to 

tell the relator: You can invoke discovery and you can 

learn relevant information from the defendant, but if 

you didn't know it already you can't use it at trial, 

because if you use something that you didn't have direct 

and independent knowledge of before the complaint was

filed and it turns out to be persuasive to the jury you 

can be kicked for not being an original source.

 I don't think Congress can be said to have 

had that intention.

 Second, in cases where the Government and 

the relator intervenes -- where the Government 

intervenes in the a relator's suit and the two prosecute 

the suit together, we would want the Court to avoid a 

rule that would create artificial disincentives to 

cooperation between the two plaintiffs. And the idea 

that relatively minor variations in factual assertions 

that are ultimately not necessary to the establishment 

of False Claims Act liability, if those carried the day 

then relators in future circumstances would have a 

strong disincentive to accede to the Government's 

request that one view of the evidence be emphasized 

rather than another.

 If the Court has nothing, no further 

questions --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Explain why it would be a 

minor variation if what he has identified as a defect in 

the pipe system and what turns out to be the situation 

that was covered up is the inadequate cement that caused 

the loss?

sense that it's not relevant to the defendant's ultimate 

liability. That is, if we had proved that the pondcrete 

leaked hazardous substances into the environment and 

that Rockwell knew that it was having that effect and 

that it nevertheless represented to the Government it 

was in compliance, that would be enough to establish the 

knowing submission of a false claim even if we had no 

idea what was the reason for the pondcrete failure.

 And even if Rockwell had taken the most 

Herculean measures to produce good pondcrete and had not 

departed from standards of care in any respect, if 

nevertheless they knew that the pondcrete was in fact 

failing despite their best efforts and they represented 

that it was succeeding, they would be liable under the 

False Claims Act.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question: 

Supposing he is the only source of the information 

that's publicly disclosed on which precipitated the 

filing of the complaint, and after the complaint is 

filed discovery reveals other violations of law on which 

the Government prevails, but they do not prevail on the 

theory of the original complaint. Would he be -- come 

within the statute or without? The statute focuses on 

the information that gave rise to the suit, not on 

what's found by way of discovery.

MR. STEWART: I mean, my instinct would be 

that probably he could still recover. I think the 

question then would boil down to whether the discovery 

responses are themselves public disclosures such that 

they would trigger a new original source.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Assuming we only look at 

the public information at the time the complaint is 

filed.

 MR. STEWART: I mean, probably that question 

would raise no public disclosure issue to begin with, 

because if there had been no -- at least if there had 

been no public disclosure of the fraudulent conduct that 

was revealed through discovery, there would be no need 

for him to satisfy the original source test with respect 

to those new allegations.

Circuit did not rely on that theory, said that he did 

not have to have knowledge of any fraudulent acts. It 

was just enough that he knew something that might be 

relevant to the proof of an environmental violation. 

And the reason that the Tenth Circuit said that was 

because Stone had conceded in his deposition at pages 

JA-106 and 112 that he did not know about any false 

representations and he did not know whether DOE was 

aware of any of the environmental problems.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What is your response to 

the Government's assertion, which seems to me quite 

true, that in order to -- in order to prevail it did not 

have to show why these blocks were not solidified?

 MS. MAHONEY: I think what --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It just had to show that 

they weren't. So it doesn't matter whether they were 

using his theory or too little cement. It doesn't 

matter.

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, the point is that 

Mr. Stone wasn't there when the manufacturing problems 

occurred, so he didn't actually have direct knowledge 

that pondcrete was leaking. That's the real point. 

What they're really saying is that his theory about why 

it might leak some day didn't turn out to be important 

to the gravamen of the claim. This is a fraud claim.

He didn't know anything about fraud and he couldn't have 

known they were leaking at the time, 5 years later 

because he wasn't there.

 And the statute requires direct knowledge. 

The Government's suggestion that somehow Rule 11 will be 

the basis on which we can sort out who's an original 

source and who's not strikes me as rather odd. First of 

all, nothing hardly ever gets dismissed on Rule 11 

grounds. And this is a jurisdictional statute that 

requires direct knowledge. A relator could read an 

indictment and satisfy Rule 10 just by copying the 

allegations. Does that count?

 I think that direct knowledge means there 

can't be undue conjecture. The only thing that he said 

he knew, even though it wasn't the gravamen of the 

claim, was clearly based upon conjecture, a belief that 

in his opinion this pipe would not work.

 And then when we get to the trial, there 

were 55 witnesses. Stone had not identified a single 

one of them as a person with relevant knowledge at the 

outset of the case when he answered his interrogatory 

responses. In addition, every person -- no person he 

identified testified at the case. He identified four 

documents that he said were key. None of them were 

introduced. He knew nothing about what went to trial.

In addition, I'd like to focus on the 

"voluntarily provide". That is a separate ground for 

reversal in this case, and would emphasize that the 

Tenth Circuit said the engineering order that refers to 

removal of sludge and says in my opinion this won't 

work, that's all it says -- the Tenth Circuit says 

that's fine. The district court made a factual finding 

that Stone had not communicated his concerns to the 

Government about pondcrete, saltcrete, or spray 

irrigation, the three theories issues at issue at trial 

here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There were other 

documents. He said there were other documents and the 

district court said sorry, you came up with that too 

late, I'm not going to look at the other documents.

 MS. MAHONEY: Your Honor, what they're 

referring to is the affidavit, I think. He filed an 

affidavit at the outset of the case when Rockwell filed 

the motion to dismiss and then tried to do a new one 10 

years later that was rejected.

 Thank you very much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you 

Ms. Mahoney.

 The case is submitted.
