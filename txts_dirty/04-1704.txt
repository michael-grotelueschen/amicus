CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in 04-1704, Chrysler versus --

DaimlerChrysler versus Cuno, and 04-1724, Wilkins 

versus Cuno. 

Mr. Olson. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 04-1704 

MR. OLSON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Respondents dispute the wisdom, efficacy, and 

constitutionality of Ohio's franchise tax system, but 

they face two insurmountable obstacles in this Court. 

First, they cannot demonstrate any actual, concrete, 

and direct injury as a result of Ohio's investment tax 

credit to satisfy the irreducible minimum requirement 

for standing in this Court. Secondly, the facial 

Dormant Commerce Clause challenge that they bring is 

without merit. 

Ohio imposes no burdens or tariffs on 

interstate commerce. Its investment incentive program 

is available on equal terms to in-State, out-of-State, 

local, or interstate businesses. It is 

nondiscriminatory, and it stimulates, rather than

impedes, commerce. 

Respondents are not injured when a business 

with which they do not compete receives a reduction in 

their taxes as a result of a tax credit. Respondents 

pay no higher taxes for products. They suffer no 

coercion because of a tax credit that is given to 

others. Their tax burden is not increased by Ohio's 

investment tax credit, nor will it be lessened if it is 

eliminated. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, who would have 

-- who would have standing? I understand your argument 

that Ohio taxpayers don't, but are there people who 

would have standing? 

MR. OLSON: I'm not sure, Justice Ginsburg. 

In some of this Court's Dormant Commerce Clause cases, 

competitors, who are arguably injured because they are 

paying a higher tax against the -- compared to the 

company that's receiving the benefit -- in a couple of 

cases, this Court has recognized customers of companies 

that are paying higher products, and, therefore, 

potentially higher prices, for the products that they 

purchase. And, in one or two cases, States have been 

recognized for purposes of standing. But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You think there has to be 

somebody who can challenge it, though.

 MR. OLSON: No, we don't think that at all. 

As this Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Some of our opinions say 

that, don't they, that --

MR. OLSON: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- it's not necessarily true 

that there has to be --

MR. OLSON: What -- Justice Scalia, I think 

the strongest statement is in the Valley Forge case, at 

page 489, where the Court said, "If Respondents have no 

-- the argument that if Respondents have no standing to 

sue, no one would have standing, is not a reason to 

find standing." This would convert "standing" into a 

requirement that must be observed only when satisfied. 

But the fact is that under any standard articulated by 

this Court in its article III cases, the Respondents 

here do not having standing. The effect of the tax is 

very "uncertain, hypothetical, or speculative," to use 

the words of this Court, with respect to them. They 

cannot demonstrate that they are affected by it. And 

as --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, I had asked you 

the question, because I wanted to know whether this 

case was distinguishable from Flast in that regard, 

although I recognize your quotation from Valley Forge.

 That -- Flast seemed to be a case that fit that 

description, that there was no one who would have a 

better claim for injury, in fact. 

MR. OLSON: Well, nonetheless, the Court made 

that distinction in the Flast case with respect to the 

Establishment Clause, and, specifically, the spending 

and taxing powers exercised by Congress. And the Court 

determined, in that case, that the Establishment Clause 

was a specific limitation on spending authority. The 

Court has been very careful, and many Justices of this 

Court, individually, have said that that distinction in 

that case will not be extended beyond the Establishment 

Clause, in the context of spending, in connection with 

a religious conviction, or the establishment of a 

religion. The Court has indicated, frequently, I 

think, that that is not going to be extended. 

At any rate, it wouldn't be extended -- the 

logic of Flast wouldn't be applicable here anyway. 

This is not an application of the spending power by 

Congress or the taxing power by Congress. This is the 

Commerce Clause, which is a permissive grant of 

authority to Congress, and, at most, under the Dormant 

Commerce Clause, a limitation on the States. 

These respondents are not remotely close to 

what this Court has said are the irreducible minimums.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With respect to the 

claims that are before us. But there was standing 

below for the municipal taxpayers with respect to their 

challenge to the property taxes. 

MR. OLSON: We believed, at the time, that 

there was standing with respect to the property taxes -

- the municipal taxpayers, with respect to the property 

taxes. That was the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

MR. OLSON: -- basis for the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, why isn't --

these -- why aren't the present claims brought under --

you know, within the same nucleus of operative facts, 

the same sort of supplemental jurisdiction that allows 

the Federal court to consider purely State law claims 

if they have jurisdiction of another related Federal 

claim? 

MR. OLSON: The Court has never treated 

article III standing that way, Mr. Chief Justice. The 

Court has said, "a standing is not dispensed in gross" 

-- that was the Lewis versus Casey case -- that 

standing has to looked at -- be looked at individually 

with respect to the claim. Furthermore, this -- there 

was not an identical nucleus of facts. I mean, it is the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But just to get -- I 

mean, you don't dispute the standing of the municipal 

taxpayers on the property tax issue? 

MR. OLSON: We did not, and do not. Now, I --

there may be arguments that might be made, that are 

not before this Court, with respect to the whole idea 

of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, if it's an 

article III issue, I think that's always before us. 

MR. OLSON: Well, with respect to the 

municipal taxpayers and the -- and whether there would 

be standing to challenge the property tax exemption. 

That's not an issue that has been briefed here. It's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I was thinking 

if your -- if the argument is that the claims that 

you're concerned about today can be piggybacked onto 

the other ones, then we do have to consider whether 

there's a pig to piggyback them onto. 

MR. OLSON: Yes. But that would require a 

rather significant change in the Court's article III 

standing jurisprudence. It would, furthermore, allow 

the tail to wag the dog, the exception to swallow the

rule. If anybody could bring any kind of a case at 

all, then all manner of cases of -- with -- for which 

the Court had no jurisdiction at all could be along 

with them. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: In any case, it's clear that 

that -- that that entity no longer has standing, isn't 

it? 

MR. OLSON: No, the -- there's a separate 

entity, called Kim's Auto. That --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

MR. OLSON: -- that entity no longer has 

standing. There are still property taxpayers, but that

the Chief Justice was asking me about the municipal 

property taxpayers with respect to the claim concerning 

the property tax exemption. Those plaintiffs --

respondents are still in the case. That's not Kim's 

Auto. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but the only person who 

could give them standing, even by this associational 

theory, is gone. 

MR. OLSON: No, there are -- there are still 

property tax -- some of the respondents that are still 

in the case are property taxpayers. Kim's Auto --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But --

MR. OLSON: -- wasn't the only one. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But they are not property 

taxpayers who have standing under any -- under the 

argument that you've just made. 

MR. OLSON: With respect to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The only property-tax 

individual who had standing was somebody whose land had 

been condemned. None of these other people in it have

had their land condemned --

MR. OLSON: In --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- have they? 

MR. OLSON: In fairness, Justice Scalia, I 

think that there are other respondents who claim to be 

property taxpayers in the City of Toledo, aside from 

Kim's Auto. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Whose land has been 

condemned. 

MR. OLSON: No. They are -- they are 

complaining about the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but --

MR. OLSON: -- property tax --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- but you say that a 

property taxowner, simply by being -- simply by being 

subject to the property tax, does not having standing. 

Isn't that your position? 

MR. OLSON: No, we're saying -- we -- the 

property -- under this Court's jurisprudence, municipal 

taxpayers have been permitted, under some 

circumstances, to challenge municipal actions, 

irrespective of the imminent domain proceeding. So, 

there is that separate issue that's in the case. 

If I might, I would like to spend a moment or 

two with respect to the merits of this case, because it

is a very important issue. 

Nearly every State in the United States has 

some sort of incentive program. This -- with respect 

to the location of businesses or the drawing of 

businesses within the State, which is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Olson, I don't mean to 

deflect you from getting on to the merits, but there 

was one point in your brief that was of concern to me. 

That is, you said that you questioned whether, 

assuming we accept your argument on standing, it would 

be appropriate to return this case to the court of 

appeals with instructions that it be remanded to the 

State court and with the counsel fees that 1447 entitle 

one to. And you said that would not be right. 

MR. OLSON: No. We believe that the case was 

properly removed, and, therefore, there's not counsel 

fees with respect to the removal statute; that the 

proper resolution would be to vacate the Sixth Circuit 

decision and then remand to the district court for a 

dismissal because of lack of standing, or the Court --

this Court hasn't resolved whether it would be a 

dismissal or a remand to the -- to the State court. We 

don't believe that there would be standing under State 

court taxpayer or State -- Ohio jurisprudence, either.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 04-1724 

MR. COLE: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please 

the Court: 

We agree with DaimlerChrysler's position, 

both as to standing and as to the merits. The 

Respondents' grievance as taxpayers, the sole standing 

argument they press here, is a textbook example of the 

generalized public grievance that the Court has 

repeatedly rejected as a basis for -- or for standing. 

Respondents' only claimed taxpayer harm is their 

assertion that the State fist loses money as a result 

of the investment tax credit. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do they have standing 

in State court? 

MR. COLE: Your Honor, we do not believe that 

they have standing in State court, either. Ohio has a 

taxpayer standing doctrine much like the Federal 

taxpayer standing doctrine. They would need to show 

some unique harm separable to them. I believe the 

language is that they would have to show that they 

contribute to a special fund. And that's out of a case

called Masterson, in Ohio. There is a separate Sheward 

case that the Respondents cite in, I believe, footnote 

5 of their brief. We don't believe that this falls 

within the Sheward exception to standing, in Ohio. 

There's a certain exception that allows certain case 

of great public importance to go directly to the 

Supreme Court, but we do not believe that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So --

MR. COLE: -- this would fall within that. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And what about the 

municipal taxpayers on the property tax claim that we 

were talking about earlier? 

MR. COLE: Yes, Your Honor --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do they have 

standing? 

MR. COLE: Yes. And I wanted to respond a 

little bit to Justice Scalia's point. I think what 

they're trying to claim is, because they have municipal 

taxpayer standing to challenge the property tax 

exemption, that that somehow allows them, then, to 

sweep in their challenge to the investment tax credit, 

as well. We don't dispute that they have municipal 

taxpayer standing to challenge the property tax 

exemption. We do, however, dispute whether or not that 

gives them standing to also challenge the ITC.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's because it's a 

local -- it's a Toledo city property tax, is that the 

distinction you're making? 

MR. COLE: Well, the property tax exemption 

is a State tax program, Your Honor, but it requires 

action by local city leaders --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, that's --

MR. COLE: -- to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: You would be challenging 

the local action --

MR. COLE: It --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- rather than the State --

MR. COLE: It --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- action, and that's how 

you distinguish the municipal taxpayer. 

MR. COLE: In a sense, that's right, Your 

Honor. This Court has noted that the relationship 

between a municipal citizen and a municipal corporation 

is akin to between a shareholder and a corporation, 

generally, and that, in some instances, that will allow 

the municipal citizens to challenge the actions of 

their municipal leaders, in a sense. This property tax 

exemption involves that type of action. It would, in a 

sense, be a challenge to that, and, I think, cognizable 

under the Court's municipal taxpayer --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, a tax -- just --

so, a taxpayer in Wyoming can't challenge the State tax, 

because his claim is too diffuse, but a resident in New 

York City can challenge the city tax, because it's not. 

MR. COLE: Your Honor, when looked at from a 

numerical basis, I agree that the distinction might not 

seem to carry a lot of weight. The Court, however, has 

not looked at it in terms of numbers, it has looked at 

it in terms of the, quote, "special relationship" that 

arises between a municipal citizen and a -- and a 

corporation. And presumably that special relationship 

exists independent of the size of the municipality. 

But, in any event, whether or not they have 

municipal taxpayer standing to challenge the property 

tax exemption, there's no way to somehow grow that into 

standing to challenge the separate enactment by the 

Ohio General Assembly. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: There's also a 

redressability problem, too, isn't there? I mean, 

assuming they could, is there any -- would action 

against the Assembly eliminate their tax? 

MR. COLE: It wouldn't, Your Honor, although --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No? 

MR. COLE: -- I think it puts a point on the 

problem with, in a sense, trying to grow a standing. You

ask, would it redress? And I guess the question is, 

redress what? I mean, they don't have any separate 

harm associated with the investment tax credit that's 

constitutionally cognizable. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are some -- at least 

it's arguable that there's Federal municipal taxpayer 

standing. And certainly some States have said that 

there is. And that -- and whatever Ohio might or might not 

do is not relevant to this proceeding. We don't know 

that. I'm -- you've given your opinion on what it 

would be. 

MR. COLE: Well, that's correct, Your Honor, 

but, still, there needs to be some way to grow the 

municipal taxpayer standing into --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's a --

MR. COLE: -- standing to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that's the piggybacking 

question. That's quite different. And --

MR. COLE: Right. Exactly, Your Honor. And 

my only suggestion was that, even if there is municipal 

taxpayer standing to challenge a property tax 

exemption, which we've conceded below, that doesn't 

somehow confer standing to challenge of separate 

enactment by Ohio's General Assembly. Respondents, in 

their brief, talk about this notion of ancillary

standing, but that -- the case they cited -- and they --

principally, they talk about the Flast case, where, 

in addition to considering the Establishment Clause 

challenge, the Court also, in a footnote, mentioned the 

free-exercise challenge and the question of whether 

there would be separate standing for that. 

But there, in the Flast case, it was a 

situation where they were using two theories to attack 

the same legislative enactment. Here, they're trying 

to attack a statute which they haven't shown causes 

them any harm. And so, the case is -- the challenge 

that they are bringing is, in a sense, an abstract 

challenge. It isn't one that's in a -- in a form 

that's judicially cognizable. That's why this 

ancillary standing theory, which would represent a 

dramatic expansion of the Court's article III 

jurisprudence, would not be a sound constitutional 

interpretation. It would allow the Court to interject 

itself into disputes where there's no injury to any --

no concrete injury to any specifically identified 

plaintiff. 

Article III's case for a controversy 

requirement is supposed to ensure that when the Court 

takes action, it takes action in the context of a 

particular concrete harm, and it can do its legal

analysis against the backdrop of this plaintiff who's 

been harmed in this manner. These plaintiffs can't 

meet that. They haven't shown any harm to themselves, 

any judicially cognizable harm, under article III. 

If I could, for a moment, Your Honors, I'd 

also like to turn to the merits, briefly, of the 

Respondents' claim. 

We believe Respondents' claim also fails on 

the merits of the Dormant Commerce Clause. Ohio 

provides a benefit for those who invest in the State; 

but Respondents have not, and cannot, identify any 

burden that the ITC places on interstate commerce. 

Absent that burden, their Dormant Commerce Clause claim 

fails. 

JUSTICE BREYER: On the merits, I think that 

their claim is -- take company A and company B. Both 

are located in Toledo, both hire a certain number of 

people, have a certain payroll, have a certain amount 

of property, and have a certain amount of business. 

Identical. And they're charged a tax. And now, what --

company B, when it's thinking of building a new plant 

or make new investment in machinery, if it goes to 

Wisconsin, it will discover it pays less taxes on all 

those things that were already in Ohio. And, 

therefore, the people who sell land or machinery in

Wisconsin are discovering it isn't being bought, 

because that old tax, which really had nothing to do 

with this new investment, is now less because of the 

new investment. So, that hurts businesses in 

Wisconsin. 

As I understand it, that's their claim. And 

if I've got it wrong, I'm sure you'll correct me. 

MR. COLE: Well, I don't think that -- that's 

not the way that I understand their --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 

MR. COLE: -- claim, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, then I'm probably 

wrong. 

[Laughter.] 

MR. COLE: I understand their claim -- I 

understand their claim more to be that two identically 

situated businesses, if -- both have the same tax bill 

--one builds a new facility in Ohio, one builds a new 

facility in Wisconsin. The one who builds the new 

facility in Ohio is going to have a lower tax bill than 

the one who builds the new facility in Wisconsin. 

JUSTICE BREYER: So, that -- that is true, 

and then the effect of that is that firms that now do 

business in Ohio won't build their new facility in 

Wisconsin, because they like the lower tax bill in

JUSTICE BREYER: You were saying they have no 

harm? I think they're pointing to that harm. 

MR. COLE: Well, Your Honor, first, I'd note 

that's not a harm that they face, of course, going back 

to --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what is the harm --

MR. COLE: -- standing issue, but --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- they think -- well, they 

can tell me. All right. 

MR. COLE: Yes. But --

[Laughter.] 

MR. COLE: -- separately, Your Honor, I think 

what -- in this Court's Dormant Commerce Clause 

jurisprudence, when the Court has talked about 

"burden," in the past, the Court has talked about the 

situation where activity out of State is somehow 

assessed a tax. That is, the tax in State A goes up as 

a result of activities in State B. The Westinghouse 

case is a perfect example. There, there was a New York 

tax that increased for each export transaction that 

occurred outside the State. In a sense, New York was 

exporting the tax burden to activities that existed in

some other State. And that's the sense in which the 

Court has used the word "burden" in its past cases, not 

this more amorphous sense that Plaintiffs -- or 

Respondents are pushing here. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There isn't -- the tax 

credit doesn't give them -- require them to buy, in 

State. I mean, the purchase -- whatever they equip the 

plant with can come from vendors and manufacturers, out 

of State? 

MR. COLE: That's absolutely right, Your 

Honor. There's no limit on where the taxpayer 

purchases the equipment they install in the State. 

There's no limit -- no effect on where the goods from 

the factory go. There's no limit on who you can hire 

to work in the factory, or where they come from. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the credit's available 

to out-of-State companies. 

MR. COLE: Absolutely, Your Honor. The 

credit is available independent of whether you already 

have a presence in Ohio, whether you've never had a 

presence in Ohio, whether you've never even paid taxes 

in Ohio before. Certainly, if you invested within the 

State, you're now going to have a corporate franchise 

tax bill, and the credit would be useful to you at that 

point. But you could have had no pre-existing

relationship with the State at all, as a taxpayer, and 

still take advantage of this tax credit. It's equally 

available to all comers. 

The only question is, What do you do in the 

State of Ohio? Do you invest money in the State of 

Ohio? And the credit turns on the amount of that 

activity in Ohio. If DaimlerChrysler establishes a new 

plant in Missouri or Montana or California, it, in no 

way, impacts the credit that they receive in Ohio. 

They're not deprived of that credit. It doesn't become 

of a -- of a lower value because of their decision to 

invest elsewhere. 

And so, under this Court's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it would be 

of higher value if they invest it in Ohio. I mean, 

that's all --

MR. COLE: Interestingly, Your Honor, it --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Presumably, the Ohio 

legislators were not doing this irrationally. 

MR. COLE: I would -- I would hope not, Your 

Honor. I mean, I think the sense is that it increases 

investment in Ohio. And that's what this Court has 

called a "laudable goal" of State economic policy, is 

to try to increase investment within the State to 

benefit the citizens of the State. Certainly, that's --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That -- in some 

sense, at the expense of the citizens in other States. 

MR. COLE: I don't know, Your Honor. A 

couple of responses to that. First, to the extent this 

spurs investment that otherwise would not have taken 

place anywhere else, of course that's just positive 

sum. That's new economic development that wouldn't 

have occurred, but for this incentive, or incentives 

like it. 

Of course, at some level there's going to be 

competition for where these manufacturing facilities 

are located. But, again, this Court has noted that 

competition among the States for their share -- or 

their fair share of interstate commerce is not, in and 

of itself, a Commerce Clause problem. The question is 

only when that competition becomes discriminatory in 

some way. And what the Court has meant by 

"discriminatory" is, Does it somehow tax your decision 

to be somewhere else? When you decide to be in 

Missouri, does that increase your Ohio tax bill over 

what it would otherwise be? 

Camps Newfound, perfect example. You decide 

that you're going to serve an interstate clientele, 

your tax bill goes up above what it would be if you 

didn't serve an interstate clientele. And Ohio's tax

credit doesn't have that characteristic that the Court 

has found so troubling. 

In fact, looking back through the Court's 

cases, over and over again this notion of burden comes 

up, and -- whereby, "burden," it means "imposing taxes 

on the business of other State," all the way back to 

Guy versus Baltimore, "You can't build up your commerce 

by means of an -- unequal and oppressive burdens upon 

the industry and business of other States." 

So, certainly if Ohio were attempting to tax 

DaimlerChrysler, or treat DaimlerChrysler worse because 

it had put a plant in Missouri, that would create a 

Dormant Commerce Clause question. But here, there's 

simply nothing like that. In fact, Respondents' theory 

would dramatically expand this Court's Dormant Commerce 

Clause jurisprudence, and would strike down a whole 

swath of State laws that have engendered substantial 

investment-backed expectation at this point. Billions 

of dollars have been invested by thousands of companies 

in reliance on various forms of locational credits, 

whether it be job incentive credits, whether it be 

investment tax credits, whether it be environmental 

cleanup credits. All of those credits would be at risk 

under the theory that Plaintiffs espouse.

noted that the Commerce Clause demands that the States 

must sink or swim together, but it has never suggested 

that the States must be indifferent between those two 

options. Frankly, Your Honor, the States would prefer 

to swim. ITCs like Ohio's help the States keep their 

economies afloat. 

Respondents disagree with this, as a policy 

matter, but that debate belongs in Ohio's statehouse, 

not here. The ITC is not protectionist, and it imposes 

no burden on interstate commerce. And, thus, it does 

not violate the Dormant Commerce Clause. 

Ohio respectfully urges the Court to reverse 

the decision below or, in the alternative, to vacate 

the decision for lack of standing. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this question? 

Would the case be any different if, instead of a tax 

credit, they offered a cash subsidy? 

MR. COLE: Your Honor, I don't actually think 

it would be any different, in the sense that neither 

one of those two would violate the Dormant Commerce 

Clause. Of course, this Court has noted, in various 

cases, albeit in dicta, that subsidies ordinarily do 

not run afoul of the Dormant Commerce Clause. I think 

this tax credit ends up having the same economic 

impact. And, for all the reasons I stated about a lack

of burden, even if some tax credits that might be like

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER ENRICH 

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

MR. ENRICH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

I'd like to begin with the question of 

standing, and then turn to the Commerce Clause merits. 

Let me begin at the point where Petitioners 

and Respondents agree on the question of standing. The 

original lawsuit brought by Respondents in the Ohio 

State Court raised two claims, one challenging the 

investment tax credit that's before this Court today, 

the other challenging the property tax exemption. The 

point on which Petitioners and Respondents agree is 

that Respondents do have standing, in their status as 

municipal taxpayers, to bring their challenge to the 

property tax exemption. And, indeed, the district 

court agreed and found that there was standing, in the 

district court's judgment, to reach both parts of the

case on the basis of the Respondents' municipal 

taxpayer standing. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any authority at 

all for saying you can piggyback the basic case or 

controversy requirement? I mean, it's one thing to say 

you can hook a nondiverse claim, but it's a claim; it's 

a case or controversy. I'm -- I don't know of any 

authority that says that you can -- you can take a 

matter that is not a constitutional case or controversy 

and latch it onto something that does qualify. 

MR. ENRICH: Justice Ginsburg, there are two 

reasons why we believe that there is such a basis. 

First, there are cases -- one case in this Court, in 

Flast v. Cohen, where the Court has found that standing 

to raise one claim extended, as well, to raise, in that 

case, a free-exercise claim. There are a number of 

such cases in the courts of appeals. Wright and Miller 

has recognized a concept of what they refer to as 

"ancillary standing" on that basis. 

But the second point that we think is perhaps 

more important is, once there is one claim in the case 

that satisfies the article III "case and controversy" 

requirement, then there is a case or controversy here.

The question that then faces this Court is, how far 

should it reach in addressing the other claims which 

are part of that very same case or controversy? 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I think it was pointed out 

that, in Flast, at least, you were dealing with the 

same spending on the part of the Federal Government. 

Here, you have apples and oranges. The property tax is 

quite discrete from the investment tax credit. 

MR. ENRICH: That is true, Your Honor. And 

in at least some of the circuit court cases, they have 

reached a second claim where the -- where a different 

part of the same transaction was being attacked. The 

Sierra Club case that we cite in our brief is one good 

example of that. 

In the present case, the two issues that we 

challenge both arise out of the very same transaction, 

out of a deal that was entered into between the City of 

Toledo and DaimlerChrysler --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can I back you up 

just a bit before we talk about piggybacking? This 

Court hasn't held that municipal taxpayers have 

standing in this sort of situation, have they? 

MR. ENRICH: No, this Court has not ever had 

to address the question of municipal taxpayer standing, 

except in Establishment Clause contexts.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, if you want us to 

piggyback, we -- and if it is an article III question -

- we would have to decide that issue before we can 

decide whether we can piggyback your current claims 

onto it. 

MR. ENRICH: Mr. Chief Justice, you would at 

least have to decide the question of whether municipal 

taxpayer standing was -- satisfied the article III 

requirements under your standing doctrines. If you 

found that it satisfied the article III requirements, 

then that would suffice to bring this case or 

controversy past the article III threshold --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. And you agree 

that the --

MR. ENRICH: -- bring us to prudential 

threshold. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you agree that 

the municipal taxpayer standing on the property tax 

question is an open issue before this Court. We have 

not had a holding on that. 

MR. ENRICH: That's absolutely correct, Your 

Honor. We would suggest that, in keeping with the 

consistent holdings of every circuit court that has 

addressed this topic, it would make sense for this 

Court to acknowledge municipal taxpayer standing, or,

at the very least, to acknowledge that the obstacles, 

any obstacles to municipal taxpayer standing, are 

prudential obstacles, rather than article III 

obstacles. 

There are actually other reasons why we 

believe the article III barrier is crossed. We believe 

that this case -- that, as Judge Posner wrote in a 

recent opinion that we referenced in a letter to the 

Court -- it came out after our brief was filed -- in 

his analysis of the taxpayer standing cases, he 

concluded that the Court's burden on taxpayer standing 

was based on prudential, not on constitutional grounds. 

We believe his analysis is correct. 

Once this becomes a question of the 

prudential standards, we believe that the very 

particular factual history of this case provides ample 

reason for the Court to find that there should be 

standing in this particular case to reach the 

investment tax-credit claim. 

Respondents brought this case in the Ohio 

State courts largely out of a recognition that the 

standards for standing were different in the State and 

Federal courts in this area. In fact, if Petitioners 

felt that we didn't have standing in Ohio, perhaps the 

wisest strategy for them would have been to oppose

standing there. But, instead, they chose to remove the 

case to the Federal court. And there, we requested 

that the case be remanded to the State courts, because 

we identified to the district court the risk, that if 

the Federal court kept the case, we might find 

ourselves, years later, before a higher court that 

might say, "But you don't have standing," and require 

us to go back and begin all over in the State courts. 

Petitioners, at that time, argued that, in 

fact, we did have standing. And the district court so 

held. And then Petitioners have not again raised the 

question of standing until before this Court. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Have you found any other 

instance in which -- any case -- there was a absolute 

lack of standing, prudential standing, but the Court 

waived that, because it was prudential and not 

constitutional? 

MR. ENRICH: Yes, Justice Breyer. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Which one? 

MR. ENRICH: In Craig v. Boren, this is 

exactly what the -- this Court did. There, the one 

plaintiff who provided standing for a sex 

discrimination claim no longer had standing by the time 

the case was adjudicated. The plaintiff who ultimately 

had standing to keep the case going was one who,

although she suffered an actual injury, was not -- was

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Did the case use the phrase 

"capable of repetition and evading review," or -- which 

is a mootness --

MR. ENRICH: -- don't believe that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- on the --

MR. ENRICH: -- they did use that concept in 

Craig. I think that's a concept that has come into

cases --

the name plaintiff, is, it wasn't a class action, an 

18-year-old sent to turn 21 in the fullness of time. 

But I didn't understand your answer about the beer 

seller whose standing saved the case, at least in the 

view of the majority of this Court. She had a real 

pocketbook injury. She was not able to sell her beer 

to the thirsty boys. So --

she was complaining about a denial of equal protection 

to the fraternity brothers, but that she had an injury, 

in fact, there was no doubt. 

MR. ENRICH: Justice Ginsburg, the premise 

behind our argument is that the article III hurdle is 

cleared on other grounds, on grounds that I've already 

discussed and we can certainly reiterate. The question 

then becomes -- on prudential grounds. And that is the 

issue that was presented in Craig, that she had a 

direct injury, but she was in -- she did not satisfy 

the prudential standards because she was asserting 

third-party rights. And what this Court there held 

was, because the parties had adjudicated the issue 

below without objecting about standing, that the Court 

would proceed to the merits. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There was no lack of 

standing below. The problem was that the -- Craig 

turned 21 while the case was pending in this Court. 

There was standing below. He was 18 when the 

litigation started. 

MR. ENRICH: Yes, Your Honor, that -- and, 

similarly, we believe that there was standing, and 

still is standing, for the Plaintiffs to be in this 

Court on article III grounds because of the continuing

pendency of our challenge to the property tax exemption

JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, could I ask about 

the ancillary doctrine? You say the case you cite to 

establish it is Flast versus Cohen. Was the doctrine 

discussed in Flast versus Cohen, or are you relying 

simply on the fact that Flast versus Cohen involved 

both an Establishment Clause and a free-exercise 

challenge, and the Court only discussed the 

Establishment Clause challenge? 

MR. ENRICH: No, Justice Scalia, in a 

footnote in Flast, the Court specifically says, "Having 

now decided that there's Establishment Clause standing, 

we can also reach the free-exercise question without 

discussing whether there would be" --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. I --

MR. ENRICH: -- "independent standing" --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- I had not --

MR. ENRICH: -- "for that claim" --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- recollected that 

footnote. I will -- I will find it. I don't read 

footnotes, normally. 

[Laughter.] 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In any event, they were 

attacking the same thing. So, your case is different,

at least to that extent, that you have two discrete 

taxes. 

MR. ENRICH: It is, indeed, Your Honor. We 

acknowledge that, although, again, as I say, in some of 

the lower court cases there have been challenges where 

the claim that the plaintiffs did not have standing 

with regard to was challenging a different outcome in 

the same transaction or occurrence. The specific 

example was a challenge to an environmental impact 

statement, where the plaintiffs had standing to 

challenge certain elements, but did not have standing 

to challenge the potential -- the failure of this 

impact statement to consider impacts on indigenous 

tribes. And the District -- the District of Columbia 

Circuit held that they did have standing, based on 

their other standing claims, to reach that claim, as 

well. 

If I can turn, Your Honors, to the merits, if 

Ohio were to impose an income tax on those corporations 

which did their manufacturing outside of the State of 

Ohio, but not to impose that tax on those businesses 

which did their manufacturing inside of Ohio, there's 

no question that such attacks would violate the 

Commerce Clause by facially discriminating in favor of 

in-State business activity. It would be a tariff, by

JUSTICE SCALIA: What about the fact that a 

State has a lower income tax or a lower property tax 

than any other State in the Union? Does that violate 

the Commerce Clause because it induces businesses to --

MR. ENRICH: No, Your Honor, we are not 

suggesting that any tax measure which gives an -- which 

encourages businesses to locate in the jurisdiction, 

poses a Commerce Clause problem. A Commerce Clause --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What's --

MR. ENRICH: -- problem --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What's the difference? 

MR. ENRICH: A Commerce Clause problem, Your 

Honor, is posed only when the provision provides a 

benefit which is specifically distinguished and 

provided to in-State activity but not provided --

MR. ENRICH: -- to out-of-State --

MR. ENRICH: -- activity. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- in the tax example. I 

mean, the taxes are apportioned. The part of the tax --

or the business that would be taxable in the State 

gets taxed at a lower rate. Businesses say, "Gee, 

let's do more business in Ohio and pay less taxes." In

this case, they're getting, effectively, taxed at a

MR. ENRICH: But, Your Honor, in this case, 

the only ones who are getting the lower effective tax 

rate are those who locate their manufacturing activity 

in the State. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I --

MR. ENRICH: They --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The only one who gets the 

advantage of the lower -- the lower income tax rate and 

the lower property tax rate is someone who is located 

in the State. It's exactly the same. 

MR. ENRICH: Well, I'm -- in the case of a 

lower income tax rate, Your Honor -- it's a different 

situation for the lower property tax rate, but take the 

lower income tax rate first -- the lower income tax 

rate will reduce the tax burden on all businesses, 

wherever their manufacturing capacity is located, who 

have a taxable business presence in Ohio. There is no 

discrimination based on where they locate any activity. 

If they locate new activity in Ohio, more of their 

income will be subjected to that lower rate of tax, but 

that is not discriminating between two businesses, 

based on where they locate their activity.

locate -- you'd have to locate in the low-tax State to

MR. ENRICH: That's not true, Your Honor. 

The way that corporate income taxes work, they look at 

a tax -- an apportioned share of the worldwide income 

of the business. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then all the --

but all you're saying -- but you have to do business in 

the State with the lower income tax rate to get the 

advantage of the lower rate. 

MR. ENRICH: Yes. If you're not doing 

business in the State, then you will not pay any tax. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that --

MR. ENRICH: If --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- would seem to 

present the same Commerce Clause problem that you're 

posing for us today. 

MR. ENRICH: Well, Your Honor, a business 

that doesn't have a business presence in the State of 

Ohio will not pay any Ohio tax. It is not subject to 

any burden. It is not discriminated against in any 

way. That's the same situation for the property tax. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Likewise, a business that 

does not locate in Ohio is not subject to the -- to the 

higher Ohio tax, which has been reduced for them.

 MR. ENRICH: Yes, Your Honor. The --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, they're --

MR. ENRICH: -- discrimination --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- they're exempt from it 

entirely, which is even better, I suppose. 

MR. ENRICH: Yes, Your Honor. The 

discrimination here is not between those businesses 

which are not present at all in Ohio and those which 

are doing their manufacturing in Ohio, the 

discrimination is between those who are doing business 

in Ohio, but not locating their new manufacturing 

activity in Ohio, and those who do business in Ohio, 

but do locate their new manufacturing activity. This 

is the same situation that the Court has confronted 

over and over again. In Boston Stock, the 

discrimination only affected those purchasers or 

sellers of stock where the transactions had sufficient 

nexus with New York to be subject to New York's tax. 

The problem was that, of that universe of transactions, 

the ones where the sale was made on a New York exchange 

were subjected to a lower rate of tax than the ones 

that were transacted on an out-of-State exchange. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Was the legislation that 

established this tax benefit -- was it controversial? 

Were there those who opposed it as a giveaway to --

 MR. ENRICH: Your Honor, the record does not

time that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they --

MR. ENRICH: -- that this was enacted. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I have -- I will take 

judicial cognizance of the fact that such proposals are 

sometimes politically controversial. Isn't that the 

place to fight out this thing? Isn't your basic 

objection here that you don't agree that a State should 

give tax credits to business, and that's something 

that, you know, is in the political arena, and let the 

people fight it out? 

MR. ENRICH: Justice Scalia, our objection --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why should that be an issue 

that a court should decide? 

MR. ENRICH: -- our objection is that when 

States use discriminatory tax measures as a way to 

provide tax benefits to those businesses that locate in 

the jurisdiction, that it leads to a competition 

between the States that ends up hurting taxpayers, like 

Respondents here, by reducing the ability of the States 

to generate tax revenues from business.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- what you call 

discrimination is any differential. In fact, in this 

case, the effective tax differential is a quid pro quo 

for an investment. And, basically, your argument boils 

down to saying that there's discrimination whenever the 

State offers a quid pro quo for an advantage and 

somebody decides not to take advantage of it. 

MR. ENRICH: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's not discrimination. 

That is simply the effect of a free choice, and any 

business is free to make that choice. 

MR. ENRICH: Your Honor, we would suggest 

that that is exactly the situation in many of the cases 

that this Court has previously struck down as facially 

discriminatory tax provisions. In Bacchus Imports, 

anyone could move to Hawaii and produce pineapple wine 

and receive the benefit of the tax exemption. In 

Boston Stock, anyone could make their transactions on 

the New York exchanges, rather than an out-of-State 

exchange, and get the benefit of the lower rate. 

What this Court has consistently said is, 

when the benefit that is given is -- takes the form of 

a credit, an exemption, a reduction in a tax which 

applies to out-of-State businesses, transactions, and 

activities, that that constitutes the kind of

discrimination --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh. 

MR. ENRICH: -- that the Commerce Clause 

forbids. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: I could -- I could see your 

argument, if, for example, in the tax exchange case, 

there was not taxation being made of the out-of-State 

transactions. But that was the case in --

MR. ENRICH: Yes. And --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the tax. And there is --

there's no such parallel here. 

MR. ENRICH: Yes, Your Honor, there is a very 

precise parallel here. The corporate income tax 

imposed by Ohio applies to any business that transacts 

business in Ohio, whether or not it has manufacturing 

presence. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you the same 

question I asked your adversary? Suppose, instead of a 

tax credit, they said, "We'll pay for the construction 

cost of a building, or we'll give you a piece of real 

estate, in order to get you to come in. Part of big 

redevelopment progress" --

MR. ENRICH: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- "program, we would give 

you this parcel of real estate." Would that also be

subject to the same analysis? 

MR. ENRICH: No, Your Honor, it would not. 

As this Court has suggested, as far back as Hughes v. 

Alexandria Scrap, when the State is essentially acting 

as a participant in the market, deploying its own 

resources --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, they wouldn't be acting 

-- other than the one transaction, "We'll give you one 

particular benefit in this new development progress --

project, with no further participation as a market 

participant or anything like that," that would -- it 

seems to me that would fit right into your analysis. 

MR. ENRICH: Well, in terms of its economic 

effect, it would, Your Honor, but this Court, in cases 

like Camps Newfoundland, has recognized a significant 

distinction between cash subsidies, on the one hand, 

and tax benefits, on the other, largely because the tax 

that is reduced is a tax which does involve an exercise 

of what this Court has called "a primeval governmental 

activity," and constitutes a kind of regulation which 

brings it within the scope of the Dormant Commerce 

Clause; whereas, in -- ordinarily, a direct subsidy 

paid out of the general funds of the State does not 

involve any such regulatory impact on interstate 

commerce.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But in terms of 

discrimination and economic impact, they really are the 

same? 

MR. ENRICH: Yes, Your Honor. In fact, 

there's a wide, wide continuum. At the one end, there 

is the standard -- the pure tariff. On the other end, 

there is providing training for workers or 

infrastructure for a plant. This Court has clearly 

recognized that tariffs are unconstitutional. There is 

no suggestion that providing training or infrastructure 

would be. All of those have the same economic effect. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but they're -- what our 

opinions hold are that there are some matters of 

producing the same result as a cash subsidy --

MR. ENRICH: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that are no good, but 

there are other matters that are perfectly okay. 

MR. ENRICH: That --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the mere fact that it 

has the same effect as a cash subsidy is not a problem, 

as far as the Commerce Clause is concerned. And what 

you're arguing here is, the mere fact that it has that 

effect of favoring businesses that choose to locate in 

Ohio is what makes it bad, not the fact that it's 

relieving, from a tax that applies to both in-State and

out-of-State businesses, only in-State business. 

That's -- that was the Hawaii case, and all the other 

cases you cite. But what your argument here is that 

the mere fact of providing a subsidy violates the 

Commerce Clause. And I don't know --

MR. ENRICH: No, Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- any case --

MR. ENRICH: -- what we're suggesting is that 

a measure which has the identical effect, and is 

structured very much like a provision which applies a 

tax to those businesses who engage in out-of-State 

activity, while excusing from tax those businesses that 

engage in in-State activity, is a tariff, by another 

name. And this provision, as --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Except the criterion is not 

mere in-State activity. The criterion is a particular 

in-State activity, an investment, as to which the 

credit is a quid pro quo. And the opportunity to make 

that investment is open to every business, presently 

in-State, presently out-of-State, no matter where 

domiciled. 

MR. ENRICH: Yes, Your Honor. And, in that 

respect, this is no different than, for instance, the 

Westinghouse Electric case, which granted -- which 

struck down a grant of a credit against a corporate

income tax that was available to any business that 

chose to locate some of its export activity in the 

State of New York. Again --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that tax did apply to 

out-of-State businesses --

MR. ENRICH: It was --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and they got no reduction 

MR. ENRICH: It was exactly --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- right? 

MR. ENRICH: -- the same tax as the tax in 

question here, Your Honor. It was a corporate income 

tax apportioned on the basis of the ordinary three 

factors that Ohio uses, on the basis of where the 

company's sales are located, where the company's 

payroll is located, where the company's property is 

located. The two taxes, in Westinghouse and here, were 

identical. There were some small differences in 

exactly the way that the credit was structured, but the 

underlying taxes were, in all respects, identical. 

The problem that the Court recognized in 

Westinghouse is that by giving a credit that was 

restricted to a particular kind of in-State activity, 

and not to its out-of-State counterpart, the State was 

effectively providing a benefit to in-State business

and a burden on out-of-State business that constituted 

the functional equivalent of a tariff, and the Court 

struck it down. Now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Some States --

Counsel, some States have homestead exemptions to 

property taxes for people when they're buying homes in 

the State. That -- those would be invalid under your 

theory? 

MR. ENRICH: Your Honor, I don't believe that 

they would be. Again, a homesteader who buys a 

property in another State is not going to owe any tax 

to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but that --

MR. ENRICH: -- Ohio. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- that person may 

have another piece of property in the -- in the other 

State. 

MR. ENRICH: But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And he's not getting 

the benefit of this, because his homestead -- he lives 

somewhere else. 

MR. ENRICH: Your Honor, we would suggest 

that the question is whether the tax scheme in question 

in the State whose provision is being challenged 

imposes differential burdens on two different entities

based on where they locate some activity. In the case 

of the homestead exemption, the State offering the 

homestead exemption is not saying, "We'll tax you if 

you locate outside the State." Perhaps some other 

State is taxing them. But, again, this Court has 

repeatedly avoided judging the legitimacy of one 

State's tax by the question of what other States did. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they're two 

identical pieces of property, and they'll say -- one 

say, "You're going to be taxed at a lower rate if 

that's where you're living, if that's your homestead; 

but if you happen to live outside the State, you're going 

to get taxed at a higher rate." It would seem to be 

very similar to what you're challenging here. 

MR. ENRICH: Your Honor, maybe I'm not 

understanding your example. Are you imagining that the 

State that's offering the homestead exemption was 

imposing a tax on the property located outside the 

State? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, it's imposing tax 

on property in the State at a higher rate if it's not 

the person's homestead; in other words, if they don't 

live in the State. 

MR. ENRICH: Okay. So, that is a provision 

that, I think, does raise at least some questions. It's one

where I think there are strong justifications outside 

of the effect on interstate commerce that very well 

might provide ample justification for it. It raises --

and the question on which we have asked this Court to 

grant cert about the property tax exemption raises 

precisely the question of what sorts of conditions on a 

property tax exemption do, and what sorts do not, 

constitute discrimination against interstate commerce. 

I would suggest that there would be ample opportunity 

to distinguish something like the homestead provision, 

which is directed at a quite different purpose than 

encouraging in-State economic activity from --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's the same 

purpose. There's some place -- they want people to 

move in -- into the District here, for example, just 

like Ohio wants businesses to move in. 

MR. ENRICH: I would suggest that the 

Commerce Clause is much more concerned with efforts to 

relocate businesses than with efforts to protect 

individuals from burdens of local property taxation. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: A lot of money in building 

homes. 

MR. ENRICH: That is true, Your Honor. 

We would suggest that that raises a very 

different set of questions from the facially

discriminatory distinction between out-of-State 

businesses who are subjected to the tax, in the case of 

the Ohio investment tax credit, and in-State 

businesses, which are excused from paying that same 

tax, which is, again, exactly what a tariff does, Your 

Honor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

Mr. Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 04-1704 

MR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

In the first place, this is article III 

standing that we're talking about, not prudential 

considerations of standing, as the Court made very 

clear in Valley Forge, where a taxpayer seeks to employ 

a Federal court to air grievances about the conduct of 

Government or the allocation of power in the Federal 

system. The "case and controversies" requirement of 

article III is not met. 

With respect to the issue of municipal 

taxpayer standing, the Court would have to determine 

that that did exist, something that has not happened 

before, and then would piggyback onto that claim a 

challenge to a separate tax by a separate Government 

under a separate claim arising out of a separate

transaction. The deal between DaimlerChrysler and 

Toledo was separate from the tax granted by the 

investment tax credit under the State's system. 

Respondents state, in the first page of their 

brief, that, because all of these States do these 

things, these investment tax credits have only minimal 

effect on business transactions. That's the first page 

of their brief. That's harmful to their standing, 

that's harmful to their Commerce Clause challenge. 

Ohio only taxes in-State activity. It uses a 

constitutionally appropriate apportionment formula to 

determine how much of the interstate business's 

activity is attributable to Ohio, and only taxes that. 

So that if there is a benefit given because someone 

comes to the State and builds a plant there, it may 

result, actually, in increased taxes in Ohio, because 

the plant will raise the proportion of business being 

done in Ohio. But what Ohio does not do is -- what 

this Court has held unconstitutional -- is, tax the 

out-of-State activity, or burden the out-of-State 

activity, or make interstate commerce itself more 

burdensome. 

As the Court has pointed out in questions, 

Justices have pointed out in questions, this same issue 

could be raised with respect to the State of Nevada.

There's no franchise tax in the State of Nevada, and 

same with other States. Some States offer accelerated 

permitting requirements or relaxed environmental rules 

or different educate -- employment standards, all 

matters of State regulation. This Court has said that 

competition between States for commerce lies at the 

heart of a free-trade society. That is what's going on 

here. States are competing with appropriate permissive 

incentives to do business within the State. This is, 

as this Court said, a laudable purpose for State 

activity. 

What the Respondents would do would 

nationalize State tax systems. You couldn't have a 

more beneficial tax system in Massachusetts than in 

Ohio, because that would provide some sort of a burden, 

under the Respondent's theory. The same with other 

regulations by States of business. We would have a 

system where this Court would be deciding -- all States 

would have to have uniform taxation, uniform systems of 

regulations, the very antithesis of federalism. 

JUSTICE BREYER: If you have --

MR. OLSON: Now, what I would --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- dog license -- dog 

license costs $10, but you have to pay 20 if you invest 

next time in Wisconsin.

JUSTICE BREYER: By the way, we're not going 

to do it that way, we're just going to say you pay 

half. 

MR. OLSON: If you have your dog in 

Wisconsin, you may pay whatever --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, no. 

MR. OLSON: -- Wisconsin decides --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. But, you see -- but my 

point is --

MR. OLSON: If --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- separate tax in Ohio, and 

we're going to double it, though, if your next 

investment is in some --

MR. OLSON: That would be --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- other State. 

MR. OLSON: That would be something this 

Court would be severely concerned with. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Correct. Now, all we do is, 

we say, "We're not going to double it. You're going to 

pay the same. But everybody invests here, pays half." 

MR. OLSON: Well, again, that's -- and I 

think that goes to Justice Souter's point, that there's 

a relationship between the tax system and the 

investment.

 We should end on the point that every --

virtually every State has this kind of system, not just 

because of competition with States, but to find the 

right location, a depressed area within a State. And 

this is important with respect to businesses in the 

United States competing with foreign countries. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: You don't believe in 

harmonization, Mr. Olson? 

[Laughter.] 

MR. OLSON: We don't believe that the Dormant 

Commerce Clause stands the -- stands for the 

proposition that these regulations should be 

nationalized. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

[Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
