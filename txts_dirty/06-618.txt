 JUSTICE STEVENS: We will hear argument in 

No. 06-618, the Office of Senator Mark Dayton against 

Brad Hanson.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN M. MANNING

 ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

 MS. MANNING: Justice Stevens and may it 

please the Court:

 If I may, I would like to quickly frame the 

merits of the case and then turn to the jurisdictional 

issue. In United States vs. Gravel this Court 

recognized that members of Congress have to delegate 

some of their legislative authority to employees and 

these employees are a second self to the member. They 

are performing some of the legislative duties the member 

himself would otherwise perform. Therefore, they are an 

integral part of the legislative process of the member's 

office. For that reason, the member must have absolute 

trust and confidence that these employees are in fact 

performing as his second self, and to do that the member 

has to have complete discretion in selecting who these 

employees are and in managing them.

 If a court oversees a member's selection of 

these employees and his management of these employees,

then the court and not the member is managing part of 

his legislative process and that is a violation of the 

Speech or Debate Clause because the purpose of the 

clause is to ensure that the legislative process will be 

performed independently. Now --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you think -- do you 

think that we owe any special measure of respect to the 

Congress, that is most intimately concerned with the 

Speech or Debate Clause, with their view that this is, 

this legislation is compatible with that clause?

 MS. MANNING: I do not, Justice Ginsburg. 

This Court has never deferred to Congress with respect 

to its interpretation and in fact has disagreed with 

Congress, for example, in the Gravel case. But the 

other reason is that the Congress of course is a 

political body and because of that it will make 

decisions that are politically expedient at times, which 

means that over time their decisions can change, while 

the Court is uniquely designed and intended to decide 

cases on something other than what is politically 

expedient. This is especially important when we are 

dealing with the Constitution and interpreting the 

Constitution.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But what we are involved 

with in this case is Congress subjecting itself to the

laws that govern all other employers.

 MS. MANNING: It did, Justice Ginsburg, 

subject itself, but it also in Section 413 recognized 

that there may be Speech or Debate Clause issues and 

maybe not all of these cases can be adjudicated in a 

court. Not that they can't be adjudicated, but maybe 

not in a court. So while subjecting itself to the law 

and doing the best it could to do that, it also cannot 

trump the Constitution.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is what the statute 

says, and so how could the statute possibly be 

unconstitutional?

 MS. MANNING: We are not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, the Constitution --

I mean, the statute has within itself a Speech or Debate 

Clause exception. Now, I guess you can argue that a 

lower court might not accurately provide the Speech or 

Debate Clause protection that is due, but that, that 

doesn't meet, it seems to me, the, the jurisdictional 

requirement that, that the constitutionality of the 

statute be called into question.

 MS. MANNING: Well, Justice Scalia, we are 

not arguing that the statute is unconstitutional. 

Rather, it's an as-applied argument. What we are 

arguing is that the issue that was before the circuit

court was whether the application of Section 408 to this 

particular case -- and of course 408 is what gives the 

Court jurisdiction -- whether applying that to this case 

violates the Constitution.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that doesn't comply 

with Section 412, which says that an appeal may be taken 

directly to the Supreme Court from "any interlocutory or 

final judgment decree of order of court upon the 

constitutionality of any provision of the Act." Now, 

and as-applied challenge is not a challenge to the 

constitutionality of the provision.

 MS. MANNING: Justice Scalia, in the United 

States versus Eichman, that statute at issue there had 

statutory direct appeal language that was exactly the 

language of 412.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't there a further 

problem here, though, that the order of the district 

court gave no explanation? We have no way of knowing 

exactly why the court ruled the way it did, and for that 

reason the appeal, the review, was that the original 

appeal was taken properly to the court of appeals, so 

that we are here not on appellate jurisdiction, but cert 

jurisdiction, if at all.

 MS. MANNING: I believe that you can take 

appellate jurisdiction of this case because, as I was

saying, in United --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, there'S no direct 

appeal. We have appellate jurisdiction only if there's 

a direct appeal and there's no direct appeal.  This is 

coming from the court of appeals.

 MS. MANNING: Oh, Section 412 provides 

direct appeal from either court, unlike the Flag 

Protection Act direct appeal language, which must be 

from the district court. Section 412 doesn't limit it 

to an appeal from the district court. It can be either 

one.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What pages are the text of 

412 set out on? You're going to have to help me here.

 MS. MANNING: I'm sorry. With respect to --

it's at the jurisdictional statement at page 65a. And 

the direct appellate language that was at issue in the 

Flag Protection Act did limit the appeal to appeals from 

the district court. But Section 412 is different from 

that. It doesn't --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, why wasn't the ruling 

of the district court a ruling upon the 

constitutionality of the statute as applied? As I 

understand it, you moved to dismiss the case on the 

ground that an individual performing the duties that 

Mr. Dayton performed cannot sue a member of Congress for

employment discrimination and the district court denied 

that. Why isn't that a ruling on the constitutionality 

of the, of the statute as applied?

 MS. MANNING: Well, Justice Alito, the 

argument we made was that to reach that decision there 

were a couple of sub-arguments the court had to reach. 

We had argued that, number one, is there a waiver of 

sovereign immunity? If not, then is an employee who 

meets the I'll call the duties test that we've set out 

in our brief, is that employee's claim jurisdictionally 

barred from court review, and if so does Mr. Hanson meet 

that duties test? Now, the court could have decided 

that Mr. Hanson doesn't meet the duties test, therefore 

we never have to reach the constitutional issue, and 

that would have been a decision on his duties, not on 

the Constitution.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Was there a dispute about 

the nature of his duties?

 MS. MANNING: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE ALITO: Not how you characterize his 

duties, but what his duties actually were. Was there a 

dispute about that?

 MS. MANNING: He did not dispute his duties. 

What he disputed was -- what he said was that of the 

duties we set forth in the affidavit -- and that was

Mr. Kimball's declaration, which is at the 

jurisdictional statement at 66a -- he said that they 

represent only 5 percent of his legislative duties over 

the course of his employment. Well, of course, we're 

not setting forth every jurisdictional duty he had over 

the course of his employment. So he --

JUSTICE ALITO: But didn't the district 

court rule that somebody performing those duties can 

constitutionally be tried -- bring suit, and it doesn't, 

and it doesn't violate the Speech or Debate Clause? So 

I don't see how that's not a ruling on the 

constitutionality of the statute as applied.

 MS. MANNING: No, Justice Alito, the court 

didn't rule that. The court just gave us a minute 

order, and there's a possibility that it ruled that, but 

there is a possibility that it just said it doesn't 

matter what test you're telling me, counsel, because 

this particular employee doesn't meet your test to begin 

with. So I'm saying, the court could have said, I'm 

saying he doesn't meet --

JUSTICE BREYER: Don't you agree with 

Justice Scalia -- Justice Alito? Don't you agree with 

Justice Alito? I thought he's saying it's a ruling on 

constitutionality.

 MS. MANNING: It is a -- not the district

court ruling. Not the district court. The appellate 

court, yes. I'm sorry, Justice Breyer. The appellate 

court, yes; the district court, no, because the district 

court was merely a minute order. And it's a possibility 

that it could have been unconstitutional and a 

possibility it could not.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I see.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: My problem is, it's 

extraordinary. We have very few direct appeal cases any 

more and I, I am loathe to read Section 412 as embracing 

a decision by a court that a particular use of this 

statute was unconstitutional. You say it was, the 

statute was unconstitutional as applied. That's sloppy 

language. It really means that this application of the 

statute or the use of the statute for this purpose was 

unconstitutional.

 I think that's something different from 

saying that it was an order of the court upon the 

constitutionality of any provision. Which provision of 

this Act has been held to be unconstitutional?

 MS. MANNING: Section 408 as applied to this 

case is unconstitutional.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which -- but it hasn't been 

held to be unconstitutional. It's perfectly 

constitutional. You're just saying it can't be used in

this particular case.

 MS. MANNING: Well, when Congress --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, read the language. 

It says "The constitutionality of any provision of this 

act," not "the constitutionality of the application of 

any provision of this act."

 MS. MANNING: Yes, and in United States 

versus Eichman, Justice Scalia, the very same language 

was at issue.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What is that citation? I 

was looking for that. Is that cited in your brief?

 MS. MANNING: Yes, United States versus 

Eichman is cited at the Appellant's reply brief at page 

1.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Thank you.

 MS. MANNING: And the statutory section is 

18 U.S.C. Section 700(d), and the direct appeal language 

is exactly the same, "upon the constitutionality of a 

provision of this act." And this Court accepted direct 

appeal when the issue was whether the application of the 

Flag Protection Act was unconstitutional. In any event, 

even if this Court were not to take jurisdiction --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But in the flag case the 

whole statute was either valid or not. There weren't 

different applications, were there?

MS. MANNING: Counsel argued both, but this 

Court did not deal with both. This Court actually took 

direct appeal just on the as-applied argument. Counsel 

argued the statute was unconstitutional and the second 

argument was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You mean we held that the 

statute was constitutional on its face?

 MS. MANNING: What the Court held was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'll look at Eichman, but 

it's not my recollection of the case, that the whole, 

the essence of the duty imposed by, under the statute 

was held.

 MS. MANNING: It was the application in that 

particular situation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but there's always 

an application or there's no case.

 MS. MANNING: Well, the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Absent some declaratory 

judgment provision.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: We simply didn't rule hold 

was a right to burn flags in some cases and not others.

 MS. MANNING: Well, there were questions 

that the parties raised. One was, is the statute 

unconstitutional altogether. And the Court didn't even 

touch that. Instead the second argument they raised was

well, is it constitutional -- unconstitutional, rather, 

as applied on these facts? And that is what the Court 

took the case on, that was what allowed direct 

jurisdiction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what had the lower 

court held? It isn't a question of what we held; it's a 

question of what the lower court had held. Had the 

lower court held that it was unconstitutional?

 MS. MANNING: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia, I 

don't remember what the lower court held in that case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, but that can mean 

-- you can always dispose of a, of a facial challenge by 

just saying we don't have to reach the facial question; 

we can decide it on an as applied question. But in 

order to get here in the first place, it has to be a 

challenge to the constitutionality of a provision of the 

Act.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And in we recite that the 

district court held the Act unconstitutional as applied 

to appellees and dismissed the charges.

 MS. MANNING: Right. Unconstitutional as 

applied so it was an as applied argument. And now when 

the Court wants a statute to mean that it's only an 

unconstitutional interpretation as opposed to a 

constitutional interpretation, the Court -- I'm sorry,

Congress makes that distinction. So for example in 28 

U.S.C. Section 1257, which was a direct appeals statute, 

and has since been repealed, in that statute Congress 

did say that there is direct appeal when the statute is 

found to be constitutional, or when the statute is found 

to be unconstitutional. But it used -- Congress, that 

is, used the vague language, more vague and general 

language in Section 412, which is just upon the 

constitutionality. In any event --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I realize, before you leave 

that I realize that on a jurisdictional issue like that 

we have an obligation to raise it ourselves. But I'm --

I'm -- I'm curious, was -- was jurisdiction contested in 

that case?

 MS. MANNING: Not that I recall in the 

Eichman case. Not that I recall.

 JUSTICE SOUTER:

 MS. MANNING: Okay. In any case, this Court 

should accept the petition, take this case on a petition 

for writ because the decision of the court of appeals 

was upon a question of Federal law that is an important 

question.

 Moving to my Speech or Debate Clause 

argument, with respect to Speech or Debate Clause, this 

Court has held that all acts that are within the

legitimate legislative sphere are protected by Speech or 

Debate Clause immunity. And the Court has defined what 

is inside that sphere as anything that is part of the 

due functioning of the legislative process. And when an 

employee is an alter ego, that is, a second self of a 

member, that employee by definition is actually 

performing part of the member's job. He is performing 

legislative acts so he is in this sphere. He is doing 

something that is part of the due functioning of the 

legislative process. He is in that sphere.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What does he do? I mean I 

looked at what he does in 74, 75, 76a. He seems to 

spend a lot of time moving furniture. He lists that 

twice. He runs the office. And he represents, he is 

out in the local office somewhere and he talks to 

constituents. I mean, he doesn't even appear in the 

Senate office except very rarely in which case he is 

doing casework. So I guess if he is included in that, I 

mean so is a full-time furniture mover.

 MS. MANNING: Justice Breyer, he did 

significantly more than that. First --

JUSTICE BREYER: I have the whole list here. 

What here suggests, he ever -- he doesn't even write a 

statement for the floor. There is nothing here that 

suggests one word of anything he did ever went to a

committee meeting, to a floor of the Senate, anything.

 MS. MANNING: Oh, Justice --

JUSTICE BREYER: What?

 MS. MANNING: Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: What are the words?

 MS. MANNING: Actually in the Kimball 

declaration, which is at jurisdictional statement 66a, 

and the self evaluation of Mr. Hanson which is attached 

thereto as a jurisdictional statement at 78a, and this 

is his self evaluation and Mr. Kimball, his supervisor 

at the time telling what he had done, he being 

Mr. Hanson.

 Some of the things Mr. Hanson did was he did 

talk to constituents, but remember of course the member 

is in D.C.; he is supposed to be representing people in 

the State. The very people who have contact with --

JUSTICE BREYER: I agree with that one. I 

just said he doesn't do anything that gets to the floor 

of the Senate, that gets to a committee report, that 

gets to a committee hearing. Now what in there -- and 

you said it was not contested, so I guess the best 

source if it's not contested is his affidavit.

 MS. MANNING: Justice Breyer actually he did 

both of those. He for example, when talking to the 

constituents realized that there was a problem with

respect to ambulance reimbursement for health care. He 

went to the Senator and said we've got a problem here in 

the State, and the constituents have identified it. He 

then said to the Senator, I think you should draft 

legislation on this and I think you should have a 

committee hearing on this. Both of which the Senator 

did. Mr. Hanson drafted that legislation. He --

JUSTICE BREYER: Oh. Where does it say 

that? He drafted legislation that was then introduced?

 MS. MANNING: Yes, he did. He drafted --

JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say that?

 MS. MANNING: That is in the Kimball 

declaration which is jurisdictional statements at page 

66a. And he also prepared the witnesses for the 

hearings. Justice -- I'm sorry, Senator Dayton had the 

hearing on the health care issue, and Mr. Hanson 

identified the witnesses for that, prepared them, wrote 

the questions for the hearing and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, he didn't do 

exclusively that stuff anyway. We can certainly all 

agree on that. And why isn't it sufficient that when 

any of those issues are, his activities in any of those 

capacities are sought to be introduced into evidence, 

anyone tries to contradict them, then you can bring in 

your Speech or Debate Clause objection?

MS. MANNING: Because it is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is the whole suit 

precluded?

 MS. MANNING: The whole suit is precluded 

because when you have as we do an employee who is in 

this legislative sphere, that the Court has identified, 

he is in that sphere because he is performing 

legislative acts. So a member who decides, you know, I 

don't want him in my legislative duties anymore, my 

sphere, I'm pulling him out. Taking him out, when the 

member takes him out of that process, he has done 

something -- he being the member -- that is also part of 

the functioning of the legislative process, which is the 

test.

 So the termination itself is part of the 

functioning of the legislative process which is the test 

for a legislative act. And therefore this case is 

predicated on a legislative act. That is, the 

termination. And in Doe V. McMillan this Court stated 

that a case that is predicated on a legislative cannot 

be adjudicated.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm puzzled. Firing 

somebody is a legislative act?

legislative act?

 MS. MANNING: Firing not anyone is a 

legislative act, but firing your second self is a 

legislative act. And the reason for that is that you 

are doing something that is part of your legislative 

process. You created a hole in your legislative 

process; you have taken out an employee who is your 

second self. This is your second self. And you've 

decided, you know, I think my legislative process is 

going to work better with him gone.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's part of -- how many 

second selves would there be?

 (Laughter.)

 MS. MANNING: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: On the Senator's staff?

 MS. MANNING: I'm sorry. I still didn't 

hear.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many second selves? 

Of -- what universe are you covering? Who is not a 

second self, who works in a Senator's office?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe he was the 23rd self.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you have to figure 

out when he was hired.

States vs. Gravel, this Court stated not only do you 

have second selves, but you must -- members must 

delegate and redelegate and redelegate authority. That 

implies there are a lot of second selves. It's not one 

person. So there can be --

JUSTICE BREYER: What's wrong with this? I 

found what you're talking about here. It says in 

paragraph 13, contrary to what he says in his own 

evaluation, that Senator Dayton's staff, including 

Mr. Hanson -- that's a little uncertain, what they mean 

by that -- introduced a bill and drafted it. Okay? And 

then on paragraph 14 they say on November 15th, 2001, 

Mr. Hanson -- just as you said -- planned a Senate 

Government Affairs Committee meeting, selected hearing 

witnesses and prepared questions.

 Now suppose that we did as the court, lower 

court wanted to do, say let's just see if that becomes 

relevant. Because it's possible, given his other tasks 

that those two incidents, one on November 15th and the 

other, whenever help he gave to the drafting, had 

nothing to do with his being fired and nobody claims 

that. So what they said is let's wait and see if that 

becomes relevant. Now what's wrong with that solution?

 MS. MANNING: What's wrong with that 

solution is that when a member, as I was explaining in

response to Justice Stevens' questions, when a member 

has a second self who is in the legislative process and 

the member says you know, I'm pulling him out of the 

process because he doesn't perform well, he -- I don't 

think he is my second self, that termination for 

whatever reason is part of the process because the 

member has changed the process.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Let's make an 

absurd case out of it which I'm trying to do a little 

bit to get you to focus on it. Let's suppose he got 

fired because he didn't move the furniture properly.

 MS. MANNING: The -- it is a whole employee. 

When he is removed from the process for whatever reason, 

he is gone from the process so that is part of the 

functioning of the process. If I may give an example, 

let's say that the Senator is at Union Station and he is 

buying a gift for someone and he hears someone making 

very derogatory statements to the cashier, and he turns 

around and lo and behold, this is his legislative 

director. And he says I can't have this person as my 

second self; I don't talk to individuals that way; this 

has nothing to do with my legislative process but this 

is a second self and he is not my second self and I pull 

him out of the process.

 That has affected his legislative process.

He now has a hole in this sphere, this legislative

legislative process. He didn't matter, why he is gone. 

He is gone.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Isn't that a -- can you 

give me examples of cases where that Act applies?

 MS. MANNING: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you give me instances 

in which employees of an the office of a Senator are 

covered by these obligations and cannot invoke the 

Speech or Debate Clause? What's the classic example 

where you can't invoke the Speech or Debate Clause?

 MS. MANNING: Where you cannot invoke the 

Speech or Debate Clause.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yeah.

 MS. MANNING: Was that the question, or can?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. Because it seems to 

me that your argument just completely eviscerates the 

intent of the Congress in passing this Act.

 MS. MANNING: If I may answer the second 

question first, approximately 75 percent of the people 

who are covered by this Act, the employees who are 

covered by this Act are not employed by members of 

Congress or committees. Now those employees for the 

most part -- and not all of them, because some of those

employees do work on the floor, but for the most part --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, except the Act 

itself has a provision for office of Senators.

 MS. MANNING: And those employees --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so it seems to me 

you're giving no effect to that. You say there is a 

hole in the process the minute the furniture mover is 

gone?

 MS. MANNING: No, Justice Kennedy, those 

employees -- first of all some of those employees can 

sue. For example the Court has said that writing news 

releases or newsletters to constituents, this is in the 

Brewster case, are not, that is not a legislative act. 

So if we have an employee in a member's office like the 

deputy press secretary who does those kind of things, 

that person is not performing legislative acts. But in 

addition to that these employees still have a -- a 

forum; their forum is the Office of Compliance, which is 

unique to the Congressional Accountability Act. And the 

Office of Compliance has cases heard before retired 

judges; the employees get the same remedies as they 

would in court. It is the same procedure except that it 

is an expedited procedure and it is a confidential 

procedure.

 So these employees are, it's not that they

can't sue; it's that they cannot sue in Federal court.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If this statute --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Wouldn't they get into --

no, you.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If this statute was set up 

so that the defendant here was the Senate, as opposed to 

the office of a Senator, would you still say that this 

suit couldn't go forward?

 MS. MANNING: With respect to the abatement 

issue, I would -- this is with respect to the abatement 

issue -- I would say that the case would not be abated, 

because the defendant would still exist. But with 

respect to the Speech or Debate Clause issue I would say 

it could not still go forward, and the reason for that 

is the immunity is, as this Court stated in Gravel, is 

not like a badge that attaches to different people and 

different entities. It's an expression of a policy, 

which means that whenever a case is going to infringe 

into this legislative sphere, irrespective of who the 

defendant is, then the case could not be adjudicated in 

a Federal court.

 And so for example in Eastland versus 

Servicemen's Fund this Court stated that a committee of 

the Senate is covered by the Speech or Debate Clause. 

And in Tenney although that was a State case, the Court

did apply the Speech or Debate Clause jurisprudence. 

The Court there said that a committee of the State is 

covered by the Speech or Debate Clause and the case 

would be dismissed.

 And then in Doe vs. McMillan, in that case 

there was a consultant to Congress and he was sued. 

There was functionaries of Congress that did not work 

for a member, did not work for a committee and the Court 

held in that case that if those, if the consultant and 

the functionaries were performing duties that were 

within this legislative sphere, the Speech or Debate 

Clause clause applies and the case was dismissed.

 JUSTICE ALITO: In what sense would the 

member be called to answer under those circumstances, if 

the member isn't a defendant and has no financial 

liability and is able to invoke the clause as an 

evidentiary privilege? In what sense would the Speech 

or Debate Clause be applicable?

 MS. MANNING: In the scenario where the 

Congress is the defendant?

 JUSTICE ALITO: Yes.

 MS. MANNING: Well, what we are arguing is 

that the termination itself, the termination itself is a 

legislative act because the termination itself is part 

of the due functioning of the legislative process. And

in Doe V. McMillan the Court stated that when a case is 

predicated on a legislative act, court jurisdiction is 

barred. Now also in answer to your question it doesn't 

matter who the defendant is. The member, let's say 

Congress was --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well why doesn't it matter 

who the defendant is? Because I don't, this so-called 

office of Senator Mark Dayton is a construct that I 

understand, and there is no immunity problem there. But 

if, if that office is gone now and getting to your 

hypothesis, if the, if -- if the true party is the 

Senate of the United States, has there been any 

unequivocal waiver of immunity with respect to the 

entire Senator or the Senate of the United States as an 

institution?

 MS. MANNING: No Justice Ginsburg, there has 

been no waiver --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm Justice Souter.

sorry. Justice Souter --

defendant. Section 1408 of the CAA which of course 

gives the Court jurisdiction --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but I was just going 

to say if this case continues we've got to accept the 

proposition that the Office of Senator Mark Dayton is 

still a, some kind of an entity that has got to be 

accorded reality by the judiciary, right.

 MS. MANNING: That is correct, because --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And how do we do it? I 

mean, you've said -- I don't want to go too far with a 

metaphor, but you spoke a moment ago of there being sort 

of a, what did you say, a hole or a space in the 

legislative sphere when somebody is fired. In the 

sphere at the moment is totally empty. The Senator's 

gone. Everybody knows that this, this office of Senator 

Mark Dayton is a totally fictional construct. And in 

reality, as you point out, the money is going to come 

out of the Senate or some Senate fund. If we allow this 

to go forward, we've got to face the reality that it's 

the Senate which is the defendant and there hasn't been 

a waiver of immunity.

 MS. MANNING: I agree with that, Justice 

Souter. There is no defendant that exists any more. 

The only defendant in the CAA, and the language is very 

express, is the employing office and the employing

office is defined in Section 1301(9) as, for purposes of 

this case, "the personal office of a member of 

Congress." And there is no member of Congress --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but at this point 

that's silly. There's no Senator. There's no office in 

any sense.

 MS. MANNING: I agree with you that there is 

no defendant any more. This defendant has ceased to 

exist and this case has abated. There is no successor 

and when there is no successor there are not two 

adversarial parties in the case. There's no case or 

controversy, case is moot, and the case should be 

dismissed on that basis alone.

 Why -- the Court does not even have to reach 

the jurisdictional issue with respect to the Speech or 

Debate Clause because this case became moot in January 

when the function of the office, which was solely to 

support Senator Dayton -- when there was no Senator 

Dayton there was no office of Senator Dayton. There is 

no defendant that is extant in this case and therefore 

the case --

JUSTICE SCALIA: There's never an office. I 

mean, I think the office is just a fictional construct 

anyway. So what you say now has nothing to do with 

whether, whether this current Senator has, has departed

from the scene. Even if he were still on the scene, 

there still wouldn't be any such thing as that office. 

It's just a fiction, and it would always be a suit 

against Congress, and so you say none of these suits can 

ever be brought.

 MS. MANNING: Justice Scalia, it is not just 

a fiction.  The office --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why isn't it a waiver of 

sovereign immunity when you set up a suit that envisions 

a suit which will be paid off by the Senate? Why isn't 

that a waiver of sovereign immunity?

 MS. MANNING: It is, Justice Scalia, a 

waiver of sovereign immunity that has a condition on it.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is it unequivocal?

 MS. MANNING: It is unequivocal --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, when it's done on 

the basis of this fiction, is that what we should accept 

as an unequivocal waiver?

 MS. MANNING: Well, first, I disagree with 

the premise in that I don't think it is a fiction that 

this office never existed. The office, the personal 

office of a member of Congress -- members of Congress 

didn't work out in the hallway before the CAA was 

passed. There was always a personal office of a member 

of Congress. So in that sense it is not a fiction.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: A physical, a physical 

office, yes. I mean, they didn't work in the hallway. 

But their staff salary was not paid out of their, quote, 

"office." It was paid out of the Senate.

 MS. MANNING: Well, actually the structure 

doesn't support that. The Senate, within the Senate, 

each member does pay the salary, sets the salary. We 

can have legislative directors and do have legislative 

directors in two different offices, different salaries, 

different numbers of paid days, different number of 

annual leave days.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Setting it is quite 

different from paying it.

 MS. MANNING: It is paid for --

JUSTICE SCALIA : The Senator sets it and 

the Senate pays it.

 MS. MANNING: Justice Scalia, actually the 

Senate is given an appropriation and all of his salaries 

must be paid from the appropriation.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. The Senate puts a 

limit on how much money it will spend for a particular 

Senator. That's all that amounts to. It doesn't hand 

him the money. It's still the Senate's money, isn't it?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. SALZMAN

 ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE

 MR. SALZMAN: Justice Stevens and may it 

please the Court:

 The motion to dismiss in this case raised a 

single issue, the issue of absolute immunity; more 

specifically, whether the employing office created by 

Congress as the defendant in these kinds of cases can be 

sued by a member of a Senator or a House of 

Representatives staff. The Dayton office argues that a 

Senator's personnel decisions are always a legislative 

act that are always absolutely immunized by the Speech 

or Debate Clause. That argument is untenable and it was 

rejected by every one of the eight judges of the D.C. 

Circuit en banc.

 This case doesn't involve any administrative 

acts. Mr. Hanson didn't work on Capitol Hill. He was

in the Minnesota office. His, the nature of his claim 

is that he was a valued employee until he became ill and 

disclosed his illness and need for surgery, at which 

point he was fired. Senator Dayton's office first says 

that they were not even aware, that Senator Dayton was 

unaware of the need for surgery at the time he made the 

decision to fire Mr. Hanson, and then says that the 

reason for the firing was Mr. Hanson's work on a classic 

constituent service.

 This case presents exactly the hypothetical 

that Justice Breyer was asking about. Although 

Mr. Hanson had a very small, he says 5 percent of his 

duties, that were in some way related to the legislative 

process, no one contends, not Mr. Kimball, not Senator 

Dayton's office, that that had anything to do with the 

reason for his firing. In fact, the only evidence in 

the record, in this record so far, is that on that small 

amount of work that Mr. Hanson did with respect to 

ambulance legislation, he did a, quote unquote, "great 

job."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The other side's contention 

is that the firing is itself a legislative act and so 

when you challenge the firing you are challenging the 

legislative act. What do you say to that?

 MR. SALZMAN: We say that's absolutely wrong

Justice Scalia, that is absolutely wrong. The reason is 

that this Court has said that conduct that is related to 

the legislative process, that may in fact be important 

to the legislative process, is not itself a part of the 

legislative process. That is the fundamental holding of 

Brewster. And this Court has found that some actions 

that affect an employee, for example in the Bogan case, 

where a decision that resulted in the termination of a 

person was clearly legislative in nature because it was 

made in a legislative proceeding, it was voted upon by 

the legislators, and it was based upon either budgetary 

or policy determinations.

 That is a legislative act. But this Court 

in Bogan specifically distinguished that circumstance 

from a classic personnel action firing such as happened 

to Mr. Hanson here. There was no legislative act 

involved in Mr. Hanson's firing. He was just fired. 

The reason for the firing is at issue in this case. A 

jury can sort out issues like whether or not Senator 

Dayton had notice of the need for surgery, whether or 

not Mr. Hanson's performance of classic constituent 

services was bad or good, as we contend.

 But none of that involves legislative 

activity as this Court has described it under the speech 

or debate act. So our contention is that the only issue

in this case is absolute immunity and there is no 

absolute immunity in this case. This case does not 

involve a legislative act, as Judge Randolph below and 

all of the judges below recognized.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: What if his dissent -- or 

defense, rather, to the charge is that he was very 

inefficient in giving me help in legislative hearings 

and so forth, or words of that kind which might be 

arguably a legislative act, and that Speech or Debate 

Clause forbids inquiry into the quality of his 

performing those duties?

 MR. SALZMAN: Justice Stevens, certainly the 

Speech or Debate Clause does incorporate -- I'm sorry. 

The Congressional Accountability Act does incorporate 

the Speech or Debate Clause with respect to the 

evidentiary privilege and that is clear from Section 

413. In that instance, district courts will have to 

deal with the proffered evidence on a case-by-case 

basis. Obviously, the context matters with respect to 

any evidentiary privilege.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But maybe the Senator 

might argue that this is all privileged: It's the 

reason I fired him, but I can't go into it because I 

don't want to invade my own privilege not to discuss 

matters that are covered by the immunity.

MR. SALZMAN: Well, Justice Stevens, again 

if the reason for the firing would shed light if the 

district court would show that the allowing the evidence 

that is proffered in would so intrude upon a real 

legislative act, then the district court can excise that 

evidence from the case. It either can be taken out, as 

in the Helstoski case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's the test for 

intruding? If it would chill his exercise of the 

function in future cases, or if it requires him to talk 

about legislative decisions, or what?

 MR. SALZMAN: I think, as this Court has 

described it, Justice Kennedy, if it would compel the 

Senator to testify about his motives for legislation or 

for a legislative act, then a district court could 

decide that that evidence would not come in. The firing 

itself, however, is not a legislative act and the 

motivation behind the firing is not precluded by the 

Speech or Debate Clause.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What if it required him to 

say how he allocated his resources, that he allocate his 

resources 10 percent to foreign affairs issues, 50 

percent to health care issues? Would that involve is --

is that a Speech or Debate Clause problem?

 MR. SALZMAN: I don't believe that it would,

particular piece of legislation or with respect to a 

general legislative agenda. I'm not sure I would see 

that his testifying about how he has allocated money in 

the office, for example, would be anything other than 

testimony about an administrative decision.

 If he were -- for example, if a plaintiff 

certainly attempted to introduce evidence in a case 

about a speech that the Senator gave on the floor of the 

Senate in which he was accused of making maybe a bigoted 

or a sexist remark, Section 413 would clearly preclude 

that. And there may be circumstance, for example, where 

if a plaintiff wanted to introduce a draft of the speech 

or a draft of legislation, that a court, district court, 

could in those circumstances say that that intrudes so 

much on a true legislative act that the court could 

preclude that testimony from going in.

 We don't believe that in the, in the run of 

these cases, that will be difficult for the district 

courts to handle.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That doesn't quite capture 

the problem that I'm having. It's not that the 

plaintiff can't inquire. Usually they can't. But my 

thought is that the defendant cannot put in his own

defense without waiving the privilege that would 

otherwise be applicable. So he's sort of in a dilemma. 

Either I give up my constitutional right not to talk 

about this stuff or I've got to waive that right in 

order to give a full explanation of why I discharged the 

plaintiff.

 MR. SALZMAN: Understood, Justice Stevens. 

I think that in most cases that will not present a 

dilemma. Even if the Senator's explanation is, I 

assigned a real legislative aide to research a piece of 

legislation and I was dissatisfied for whatever reason, 

suppose the reason is that the aide simply didn't turn 

in the memo that that he was assigned to do. The 

Senator testifying about, I gave an assignment to this 

person, the due date was September 1st, I never got it 

or he was late or it was riddled with errors --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Or he just wrote a lousy 

memo. In order to demonstrate it's lousy, I've got to 

talk about legislative matters.

 MR. SALZMAN: If that is truly the situation 

and if a district court assessing, once all of the 

information is presented to the district court, that 

requiring the Senator in that circumstance to discuss 

really his legislative goals, we think that maybe that 

evidence would not be permitted. Now, the, this court

has recognized --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if the Senator did 

not have a defense?

 MR. SALZMAN: Well, in Brewster, Your Honor, 

this Court recognized that there may be situations where 

the court permits an indictment to go forward, in which 

the indictment itself and the proof that the prosecutor 

will be presenting does not so intrude on the 

legislative process that it would be precluded but that 

the Defendant may decide that in order to explain the 

accusation he needs to rely on legislative acts. And 

the court recognized that that may be the situation that 

the Senator is in. I believe the Third Circuit in a 

decision written by Justice Alito, the McDade case, 

talks about that circumstance, where the Senator at that 

point can choose to put in his explanation and be 

subject to cross-examination simply with respect to that 

explanation, but that the prosecution is not precluded 

in its entirety. And certainly that's what we are 

talking about here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but what if the 

Senator doesn't want to put it in? I mean, what if he 

does not want to waive the privilege? Is his only 

choice in effect to sit moot and lose the case?

 MR. SALZMAN: Well, if he chooses to sit

moot and if the evidence --

JUSTICE SOUTER: "Mute" I guess I should 

have said.

 MR. SALZMAN: Mute, I'm sorry.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MR. SALZMAN: If he chooses to stay silent, 

then perhaps the case just goes forward without an 

explanation. The defendant --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, why don't, why 

doesn't that -- why doesn't being placed in that dilemma 

in effect implicate the clause, and why can't he invoke 

the clause as a basis for dismissal?

 MR. SALZMAN: Well, Judge Randolph below 

thought that there may be circumstances where the 

evidence is so, all of the evidence is so bound up in a 

legislative act that the case might not go forward. We 

respectfully disagree with that. We think that that 

will rarely be the circumstance. But this is the system 

that Congress set up and Congress created the system in 

a, in a careful way. The defendant is not the member. 

The member faces no financial liability whatsoever from 

a finding of discrimination or unlawful behavior.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, yes, so far as the 

member's immediate financial concern, they took care of 

it. But I'm not sure about the careful way. They in

effect said, you know, if this gets into Speech or 

Debate Clause issues they prevail. And that kind of 

just leaves us with no solution for the problem that 

Justice Stevens raised and that I'm concerning with, 

unless there's, there's going to be an automatic 

dismissal when the member says, look, I cannot respond 

to this without getting into, into acts within the 

legislative process which are privileged.

 Unless you want to recognize that as kind of 

an absolute defense upon its invocation, I don't see how 

we get out of the problem.

 MR. CABALLERO: Well, Justice Souter, our 

argument is that the decision itself is certainly not a 

legislative act, and the most -- and that is in 

accordance with this Court's view of the judicial 

privilege in Forrester that the decision itself is not a 

judicial act. The reasons behind the decision in the 

legislative context could be shielded by the evidentiary 

privilege, but we think there's a clear difference 

between the employees performing a duty that is related 

to the legislative process being different than a 

legislative act itself.

 It may be that in some rare circumstances 

the Senator in order to fully defend himself feels the 

need to actually testify about real legislative acts,

such as votes on something or his conduct in a committee 

proceeding. But his assessment of an employee's 

performance, just as Judge White's assessment in the 

Forrester case of Miss Forrester's performance, is not 

legislative activity. It may be activity that is 

important to the legislative process. It may provide 

for a sound legislative arena, just as in the judicial 

sphere. But when this Court found unanimous, 

unanimously that when Judge White was assessing the 

performance of Miss Forrester in the judicial context 

and deciding, I don't think she did a good job on 

delegated judicial functions, that's not a judicial act. 

And we would say the same with respect to a legislative 

act, so --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would go for a 

stenographer in a committee hearing?

 MR. SALZMAN: Yes, Your Honor, and I believe 

that's the Browning case, that the D.C. Circuit 

originally had found would be considered a legislative 

act. And we do believe that, yes, the assessment by 

the, whoever supervised Miss Browning that her 

performance was inadequate is not itself a legislative 

activity. Miss Browning's performance obviously was 

involved, was closely tied to the legislative process 

because she was a stenographer at hearings. If the

committee, if the committee decided in a committee 

proceeding and took a vote that they were not going to 

use stenographers any more and Miss Browning had brought 

a challenge with respect to that, alleging that it was 

focused personally on her and racially motivated, then 

we think a legislative immunity might apply as it did in 

the Bogan case.

 But absent that, it's our belief that an 

assessment of an employee's performance, even if the 

employee is performing duties that are related to the 

legislative process, is not itself a legislative act.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, it could or couldn't 

be. I mean, I mean if the legislator, the Senator, 

says, I think relevant to my dismissal of this 

individual is the individual's performance that revealed 

itself in a speech or debate that I gave in the House, 

and if that's relevant, then why isn't that the end of 

the case, they can't bring it?

 MR. SALZMAN: Justice Breyer, I think that 

that is one of the rare circumstances where the, the 

Senator's assessment of the performance is very tied up 

with a legislative act.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, all he'd have to say 

is it's relevant to my decision to fire the person. 

Now, surely a jury or whoever -- it's probably a jury

matter, I guess, on this -- is entitled to take that 

into account. If it's something the jury is entitled to 

take into account, you are questioning what that Senator 

did in the speech or debate and you are questioning it 

in another place, namely, a court.

 MR. SALZMAN: You are, Justice Breyer. The 

employee's performance, we believe, of the speech 

writing would not be considered a legislative act. This 

Court said in Gravel that there is a difference between 

a legislative act which goes on in a committee 

proceeding and preparation for that proceeding, and the 

employee's performance getting the Senator ready to give 

his speech would not itself be considered a legislative 

act, but in that circumstance the district court might 

say that because the Senator's explanation is so clearly 

tied to a real legislative act, a speech that he 

actually gave on the floor of the Congress, perhaps that 

might be a circumstance where judge Randolph's view that 

that case could not go forward might apply.

 That's not this case. This case deals with 

threshold immunity issues, where the Senator's office is 

saying that any personnel decision that it engages in is 

by definition a legislative act if it relates to anybody 

who works in their office. And Congress clearly was not 

of that view. It defined every employee of the Senate,

including those who worked in a Senator's office, to be 

a covered employee and all covered employees under 

Section 408 have the right to go to court.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have any cases gone 

through a district court on the merits under this Act?

 MR. SALZMAN: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Have any cases under this 

Act gone to a district court to judgment on the merits?

 MR. SALZMAN: No, Justice Ginsburg. The 

closest -- my understanding is the closest we have 

gotten is the companion case in this case, the Fields 

case, is scheduled for trial in October and it is my 

understanding that they have gone through some discovery 

in that case. I don't believe that there have been any, 

any cases under the Congressional Accountability Act in 

court, that have made it past that.

 If there are no further questions --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I have one question. The 

Appellants here were the ones that appealed to the court 

of appeals? Did they appeal from the district court?

 MR. SALZMAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But under 1291, the United 

States Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction where 

direct review may be had in the Supreme Court. So it 

seems to me that their position contradicts their own

basis for jurisdiction here. Do you agree with that?

 MR. SALZMAN: Not entirely, Justice Kennedy. 

We do -- we had thought that initially and then upon 

reflection it seemed to us that because the minute order 

of the district -- because the order of the district 

court was a minute order that did not explain its 

reasoning, perhaps there was some ambiguity about 

whether he was simply finding that Mr. Hanson had so 

little contact with the legislative process that, that 

the case should go forward or whether he was in essence 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but my point is that 

the Appellants are telling us that this is appealable 

here directly, but if that's so they shouldn't have gone 

to court of appeals, they shouldn't have gone to the 

court of appeals; they're untimely when they come here.

 MR. SALZMAN: That is our understanding of 

the way it generally works. We believe that the GYRA 

statute, which was the predecessor to the Congressional 

Accountability Act, may have permitted appeals directly 

from the court of appeals to this court. So there 

appears to be some ambiguity. When we first responded 

with respect to the appeal, we did argue that if Senator 

Dayton's office wanted to appeal directly they needed to 

do that two years ago when the district court had ruled.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. CABALLERO

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING APPELLEE

 MR. CABALLERO: Justice Stevens and may it 

please the Court:

 We agree that there is no jurisdiction in 

this Court under Section 412. But I first would like to 

correct one of the answers regarding cases under this 

Congressional Accountability Act.

 Two cases have been finally adjudicated by 

the district courts. One was two cases against offices 

of members or committees where an employee worked for a 

member. One of those involved a finding that it was 

outside the limitations in the statute. The other case 

was a summary judgment finding of an employee who was a 

legislative employee of the Committee on Ways and Means 

and the Court found that the dismissal there was on an 

allowable ground under the statute and there was no 

violation of the employee's rights.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And there's no jurisdiction 

under 412 because?

MR. CABALLERO: Because, as we said in our 

brief, the decision of the court of appeals was a 

decision on the scope of the Speech or Debate Clause as 

that clause is preserved in Section 413 of the act and 

therefore there would be no appeal under Section 412.

 If the court does go to the merits in this 

matter, I think it's important to effectuate Congress' 

intent in enacting the statute along with its concerns 

with the Speech or Debate Clause. The Speech or Debate 

Clause provides senators and representatives with a 

constitutional privilege that is critical to securing 

the independence of the legislative branch in our system 

of government.

 Certainly, Congress is the institution that 

has the greatest interest in and is most sensitive to 

maintaining a robust speech or debate privilege under 

this Court's precedence. In enacting the Congressional 

Accountability Act, however, Congress concluded that it 

could provide its own employees with the same employment 

law protections that it had already provided Executive 

Branch employees and private sector employees, including 

the critical right of action for victims of illegal 

discrimination to bring suit in the Federal court; and 

that a suit under the Act would not infringe upon the 

Speech or Debate Clause.

Congress relied on this Court's own 

precedent in making that determination. Under the 

Speech or Debate Clause, this Court has made clear that 

the clause is robust, protects activities outside of 

just speech and debate on the floor of either House, but 

that it shouldn't be extended beyond what is necessary 

to preserve the independence of the legislative process.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Can we go back a step. I 

just -- you said this is appealable and your reason for 

it being appealable was because the statute itself --

you said it was not appealable and the reason not is 

because the statute itself said that this has to be 

applied consistent with the Speech or Debate Clause?

 MR. CABALLERO: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's your reason. So I 

take it, what about the reason that's been given, that 

this is an as-applied challenge instead of on its face? 

What about that as a reason for it not being appealable?

 MR. CABALLERO: Well, that is an application 

of Section 412, the preservation of Speech or Debate 

Clause in the statute.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no, I'm not asking 

about the argument you are making. I want to ask about 

an argument you aren't making, that the reason -- I'll 

ask about the one you are making in a second. The

reason I want to know about -- I want to know about the 

other possible reason for not being appealed, namely 

that this is as applied and not on its face. They don't 

strike down any provision. What's your view about that 

one?

 MR. CABALLERO: Our view is that that is 

correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That is correct. And what 

you do about this case, what is it, Eichman?

 MR. CABALLERO: The Eichman case they cited.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In Eichman, I was able to 

get out the district court and the last part of the 

district court, the last line of the district court, it 

says the law under which these three -- let me begin 

again -- the law under which these three defendants have 

been prosecuted is unconstitutional, which seems to me 

to contradict what Appellant's counsel told us about 

what happened in the district court.

 MR. CABALLERO: I think that's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It wouldn't matter anyway, 

because our prior decisions that do not explicitly refer 

to jurisdictional questions are not authority on 

jurisdiction.

 MR. CABALLERO: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We have that firm rule:

When we take a case and don't get into the 

jurisdictional question, it is not precedent for the 

fact -- -

MR. CABALLERO: For a finding of 

jurisdiction later, that's correct.

 I would say --

JUSTICE BREYER: So then a holding of a 

district court in your opinion, the holdings say, 

imaginary, is that no one who actually works in an 

office of a Senator and who ever worked on any matter 

having to do with legislation falls within this Act 

because that would violate the speech and debate clause. 

That would be quite major in its implication. But 

you're saying there is no appeal on that because it's as 

applied.

 MR. CABALLERO: Right. Based on the court 

of appeals decision, I would say the two arguments as 

applied in the preservation of Section 413 aren't wholly 

separate.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Does that mean if I go to 

your argument -- I mean, the problem with your argument 

it seems to me is that that leaves no room for this 

appellate provision at law, because the only reason that 

anything is likely to be unconstitutional in this area, 

at least 99 percent of it, would be Speech or Debate

Clause violation. So in that interpretation of the 

statute there is no direct appeal, or hardly ever.

 MR. CABALLERO: Well, there was a lot of 

discussion in the legislative history about the 

separation of powers generally.

 JUSTICE ALITO: We were told that 75 percent 

of the employees who were covered by the Act do not work 

for an individual member. So how could, how could a 

provision to be facially unconstitutional under the 

Speech or Debate Clause?

 MR. CABALLERO: Well, I think the provision 

wasn't held facially unconstitutional.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What could it possibly be? 

And if it couldn't possibly be then what did Congress 

have in mind when it provided it for an interlocutory 

appeal from a ruling on the constitutionality of the 

statute.

 MR. CABALLERO: Again, there was major 

debate in the Congress over whether or not the provision 

of judicial hearing of suits over congressional 

employment decisions, separate from the Speech or Debate 

Clause, just a separation of powers concern of having 

the judiciary oversee the workings of Congress, and 

there was a concern about that separation of powers 

issue, which would be a facial issue. Can you hear any

suits by employees of Congress who are employed in a 

separate branch?

 And that was where this provision has life, 

and is meant to protect the ability for a litigant to 

bring it before this Court immediately; it would be a 

facial challenge.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. That, that may make 

sense. I, I wondered why -- why they would provide for 

an appeal on constitutionality if they had in mind the 

Speech or Debate Clause stuff, when the legislation 

itself says that nothing herein shall be deemed a 

violation of speech.

 MR. CABALLERO: Right. It preserves a 

member's -- exactly. It preserves a member's speech or 

debate.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah.

 MR. CABALLERO: And when Congress did 

provide these rights under the statute, it was very 

important for the Congress under the previous regime 

affecting the Senate, employees had employment 

protections and they had administrative processes that 

they could go to. But they lacked a judicial right. 

And Congress made a specific decision that providing 

that right of action was an important employment law 

protection employees needed.

And again it relied on this Court's 

decisions both under the Speech or Debate Clause as to 

the scope of the clause and under Forrester where this 

Court held that a judge's employment decision as to an 

employee who did judicial duties was not a judicial act, 

did -- achieve absolute immunity. It was a -- it was an 

administrative act, an employment act.

 And similarly here what is brought before 

the courts is an employment act. Again this case is 

before the Court on a motion to dismiss. There has been 

no discovery. There has been no litigation over the 

claims involved. There is just a question presented 

does the Speech or Debate Clause bar the jurisdiction of 

Federal courts when a legislative, an employee with any 

legislative duties brings a suit under the Act? And I 

think the question, the answer to that question has to 

be no.

 Indeed in the case here, you could have 

litigation over whether the Senator knew of the alleged 

disability. That's one of the disputes that's been laid 

out in the pleadings, whether that was the basis for 

the, for the decision to terminate the employee.

 These are all the types of issues that play 

out in district courts. District courts receive 

evidence. They make these judgments; they see the

specific context and they make specific rulings. To try 

to decide in the abstract how you would apply an 

employment law case with the Speech or Debate Clause in 

an evidentiary sense is very difficult. And that's why 

a more full record would be necessary.  But to decide 

the question on appeal, I think the Court can easily 

decide if these cases go forward.

 One last point I would like to make is to 

address the issue of the existence of the office. It's 

not a mere creation of the Act. Senators have personal 

offices. Those offices incur liabilities or 

obligations. They buy paper; they make contracts and 

the like. When a Senator leaves office, the employing 

office still has to pay the bills that were incurred 

when the Senator was in office. And the Senate allows 

employing offices under the approval of the former 

member to submit the vouchers and receive payment. The 

employing office has life afterwards.

 Similarly here, if it incurs an employment 

liability it has life sufficient to litigate whether or 

not that liability exists and a judgment will be paid 

under Government funds under the Act.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it will -- the money is 

simply Senate money.

 MR. CABALLERO: Yes. The money is an

appropriation of Senate -- and under the fund, the money 

is an appropriation for the specific fund under the Act 

for paying judgements in these cases.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But none of those funds 

are, as I understand it, are somehow subtracted from or 

contributed by the funds of individual senatorial 

offices while a Senator is in office. I am assuming 

that those, that there is a separate appropriation for 

the payment of -- of any such judgment, is that correct?

 MR. CABALLERO: Under the Act there is. 

Congress decided to not have any personal liability for 

a member to shield them from that, and also not to 

require the member's office in cases such as illegal 

discrimination cases, to pay the awards or judgments.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. In the real world 

then at this point isn't the Senate the -- the party?

 MR. CABALLERO: Perhaps it's a party in 

interest, but I would say again that the named party is 

not a party without any life except under the Act.

 I thank the Court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Ms. Manning, you have 

about a minute left.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JEAN M. MANNING,

 ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

which the Court has found that jurisdiction is barred in 

Speech or Debate Clause cases. The first is when the 

case is predicated on a legislative act. The second is 

when the case cannot, that is cannot be adjudicated 

without questioning a legislative act or the motive for 

the act. And the third is when the member will be made 

to answer in terms of his defense for a legislative act.

 This goes to the question that Justice 

Stevens asked. In Gravel the Court made it clear that 

if the member is made to answer in his defense for a 

legislative act, that violates the Speech or Debate 

Clause. Under the, these types of cases the member 

does, would have to come forward and explain a 

legislative act: that is, why did I terminate this 

employee?

 That is the explanation, because the 

termination itself is a legislative act, he is being 

questioned about a legislative act.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right. I have one -- one 

question. Could the Senate direct you to pay this 

judgment?

 MS. MANNING: Direct me -- I'm sorry. Me 

personally?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Direct your office to --

to do that.

MS. MANNING: To pay the judgment?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because it -- suppose they 

thought there was liability and if you say yes, then I 

need to know why you and counsel who just addressed this 

are on different sides of the case, if you're both 

representing the Senate.

 MS. MANNING: They cannot direct us to pay. 

It of course comes out of the Treasury fund and the 

Senate has had absolutely no control or involvement at 

all for 12 years in any of these cases. They do not 

know --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could it, if it chose?

 MS. MANNING: Well, I believe that it cannot 

because the defendant in this case is the employing 

office.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.

 MS. MANNING: So for that reason the Senate 

has never, doesn't even know the cases exist. Doesn't 

know that we are negotiating settlement. Doesn't review 

settlement agreements. Is not involved in strategy. In 

fact the CAA in Section 403 states that the, that the 

mediation and then the counseling in the case is 

strictly confidential. The Senate cannot even know that 

they are happening. Only the employing office can know. 

In no sense has the Senate been the defendant. If the
