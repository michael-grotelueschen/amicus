 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next this morning in Case 07-512, Pacific Bell 

v. LinkLine Communications.

 Mr. Panner.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON PANNER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. PANNER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit's 

decision because it asserts that this Court's holding in 

Trinko and principles regarding unilateral pricing 

decisions as explained in Brooke and elsewhere.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are probably 

feeling pretty good about your chances since your 

opponent has given up, right?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, it is correct 

that this Court observed in Roberts that the 

Respondents' agreement that the legal position of the 

court below is incorrect, certainly should provide this 

Court great comfort in reversing the decision in the 

Ninth Circuit. And, indeed, a decision on the merits 

here is important because the Ninth Circuit's decision

is harmful to consumers, deterring beneficial price cuts 

and sufficient particle integration.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Any question should 

we have about the Article III status of this aspect of 

the dispute?

 MR. PANNER: No, Your Honor. The parties' 

agreement on a point of law does not deprive this Court 

of jurisdiction in any way, and the parties remain 

adverse in this case. The Respondents continue to 

pursue a section 2 claim, and the same intend to --

evidently intend to pursue the same relief.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you might be 

right, but, you know, with respect to standing we have 

held that that is an issue-by-issue inquiry, not a live 

case broadly conceived.

 MR. PANNER: Well, in Laidlaw the Court said 

that it was for a particular type of relief, that the 

plaintiff had to establish standing, but that's not at 

issue here. The Respondents continue to pursue a 

section 2 claim and pursue, evidently, the same type of 

relief based on the same course of conduct.

 I would also like to point out that 

Respondents, while conceding that the position of the 

Ninth Circuit was incorrect, have not clearly stated 

that they would not take advantage of a decision by this

Court affirming the Ninth Circuit. And I think that 

that's important, because there really would be no 

reason for these Respondents to say that if for whatever 

reason the Court decided that the Ninth Circuit is 

right, that they would not go ahead and take advantage 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought they asked to 

have the Ninth Circuit decision vacated. They didn't 

ask us to affirm it. They said vacate that decision is 

wrong.

 MR. PANNER: That is right, 

Justice Ginsburg, but the point is that if this Court 

were to disagree -- for example, it is well established 

that the Solicitor General's confession of error, for 

example, or a State attorney general's confession of 

error does not bind this Court. Indeed, a party's 

position with respect to the proper disposition of the 

case never binds the Court.

 So the Court certainly has the power to say, 

now that the case is properly before it: We think that 

the Ninth Circuit got it right.

 Obviously, we don't think that that's what 

we think the Court should say; but, given that 

circumstance, if the Court, for whatever reason, were to 

affirm the Ninth Circuit, there would be nothing that

would bar the Respondents from taking advantage of that. 

Even though they said that that was a legal error, if 

that were the established law, there would be no reason 

for them not to pursue it.

 And I think that that's relevant, again, to 

the question whether the parties remain adverse for 

Article III purposes. As a jurisdictional issue, the 

adversity of the parties with respect, even to the 

section 2 claim, even if intended to pursue it 

differently, the theory is sufficient.

 But the point I am making is simply to 

illustrate that adversity even with respect to the 

narrow legal issue remains, even though they are not 

contesting the proper -- contesting the proper 

disposition of that legal issue.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When this comes up, we 

usually, if a -- if a party abandons a position in 

support of a decision, the court of appeals decision, we 

have appointed -- as you noted in your brief, we have 

appointed a friend of the court to represent the 

position of the circuit.

 And here we don't have that. We don't have 

anyone that we have appointed and say you presented the 

position. You defend the position below.

 MR. PANNER: Well, that's true, Your Honor,

but there is an amicus arguing before the Court today 

defending the Ninth Circuit's decision. And there were 

two amicus briefs filed on that. Had those not been 

filed, the Court could have sought additional help. But 

the positions -- the arguments in favor of the Ninth 

Circuit decision had been put forward in the amicus 

brief, and there will be argument in support of the 

Ninth Circuit's decision today.

 And I think -- I think that the 

jurisdictional issue is answered by your question. That 

is to say, the fact that the Court could appoint amicus 

shows that this Court retains Article III jurisdiction. 

And it's very important in this case for the Court to 

reach the merits of the decision and clearly to rule 

that there is no independent price-squeeze theory under 

Section 2 because recognition of such a theory, as in 

the Ninth Circuit's, decision is very -- very harmful to 

consumers.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there any way in 

which the resolution of their price-squeeze claim would 

affect their Brooke Group Section 2 claim?

 MR. PANNER: I think it could, Your Honor. 

In their brief they refer to the possibility that the 

wholesale price that was charged could be in some way a 

proxy for costs. And this Court clearly stated that

there's a different issue as to whether a single 

economic unit is charging prices below cost; that the 

wholesale prices that may be charged are not an 

appropriate proxy.

 But I -- so, in that respect, I think that a 

clear declaration with respect to what is required -- I 

guess the distinction between the predatory-pricing 

theory of liability and a price-squeeze claim as 

recognized by the Ninth Circuit could have an impact.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just clarify: Are 

you arguing there is never a price-squeeze claim under 

Section 2? In other words, are you challenging Judge 

Hand's reasoning in the Alcoa case?

 MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, I believe, I 

am challenging Judge Hand's reasoning in Alcoa. I think 

that I would not go so far as to say that there would 

never be a situation in which a price squeeze, that is, 

an insufficient margin between wholesale and retail 

prices to allow a competitor to compete -- that that 

course of conduct could never support a claim under 

Section 2.

 But the basis for the claim would have to be 

that there was a -- a duty to deal -- or a duty to deal 

under Section 2, an antitrust duty to deal that was 

effectively being debased through that sort of pricing

conduct. But --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Was there such a duty in 

the Alcoa case?

 MR. PANNER: Well, I think that the Alcoa 

case was wrongly decided, Your Honor, in several 

respects. The critical point about -- the first point 

about Alcoa is that the conduct that was at issue was 

said to be unlawful because it was an abuse of the power 

in the ingot market and not monopolization of the 

downstream market in sheet.

 And so what Judge Hand said was that that 

was unlawful. But he expressed some doubt as to whether 

it was appropriate to treat it as an independent basis 

for -- or an independent wrong under section 2.

 But the notion that the abuse -- that 

charging too high a price at the wholesale level could 

be an independent section 2 wrong is quite inconsistent 

with what this Court said in -- in -- most recently in 

Trinko where it recognize --

JUSTICE BREYER: So there is regulation 

involved there. I mean, suppose you had no regulation 

at all involved. Why couldn't you have a monopolist at 

the primary stage, say, ingot, and what that monopolist 

wants to do is to extend its power into the secondary 

stage, say, fabrication, in order to make it less likely

that there would be a new entries to attack its primary 

monopoly? That would -- suppose you have those 

circumstances? Perhaps they would be rare, but if you 

have them, wouldn't that set forth a Section 2 

violation?

 MR. PANNER: It -- it -- it wouldn't, Your 

Honor, for the following reason: That I think it is --

it is true that the -- the key point of the -- the basis 

upon which the question -- the question presented has 

been granted and upon which the analysis has to turn is 

that there is no duty to deal at all at the wholesale 

level.

 So that the ingot monopolist has no 

obligation to provide an ingot to a downstream rival. 

And that judgment is a judgment that it is not worth 

protecting downstream dependent competitors in order to 

promote the competitive process.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, that may be the 

assumption on this case, but that may not be the 

assumption on the next case. And I understood you to be 

arguing that you wanted us to hold that at -- well, you 

wanted us to hold whether we are dealing with a 

regulatory case or in Justice Breyer's example, where 

there is -- where there is no independent regulation, 

that the greater includes the lesser; that A, there is

no duty to deal and therefore there is no obligation 

that can be violated under the antitrust laws by a price 

squeeze that does not rise to the level of predatory 

pricing.

 Is that your position?

 MR. PANNER: Well, Justice Souter, trying to 

be clear about the relationship.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, the best way to do 

that is to start with a yes or no answer. That way, so 

I know where you are going.

 MR. PANNER: Thank you, Your Honor. And I 

think that's not precisely our position.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. PANNER: Our position is that in the 

absence of a duty to deal, one does not look at an 

allegation of insufficient margin as a potential section 

2 --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But what I think we 

are trying to get at is, should we foresee a situation, 

with or without the regulatory participation of 

something like the agency here, in which there would be 

a duty to deal, which would support a price squeeze 

theory that did not amount to predatory pricing?

 MR. PANNER: Your Honor, I don't think that 

the Court has to anticipate that. I think what the

Court should say is that there are narrow circumstances 

as recognized in Trinko, where there may be a duty to 

deal under section 2. And in that circumstance there 

may be conduct that constitutes a refusal to deal, even 

a constructive refusal to deal.  There is really -- to 

give a simple example, if a widget, if the downstream 

product costs $10 and a widget is made available for a 

million dollars, that is not really dealing at all.

 But the point is that the section -- the 

price squeeze piece of the allegation really does not 

add to the underlying question of what is the section 2 

duty that needs to be enforced.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's it -- I mean, 

now maybe you can get me off what I am thinking, but now 

it sounds that the answer to Justice Stevens's question 

is yes. Now, I have, yes, overruled Judge Hand's 

opinion in Alcoa. I always thought there were 

circumstances, whether true of Alcoa or not, where that 

did make out the claim, namely, the one I suggested.

 Well, it's quite a different battle if, in 

fact, the person whose injured, namely, the fabricator 

who is complaining, has a place to go, such as the FCC 

or the Alcoa regulatory agency, because under those 

circumstances, he has a place to complain that these 

prices are out of line.

But if there is no place to go, well, I'm 

suddenly -- I'm a little hesitant to overturn Alcoa 

under those circumstances, and the reason the duty to 

deal doesn't deal with it is we could come into an 

existing world where duty or no duty, there have been 

independent fabricators who for a long time have bought 

their ingot from this monopolist.

 MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, the answer to 

that is two-fold. First of all, because there is no 

duty to deal, by assumption the producer of ingot, the 

alleged wholesale monopolist, has the privilege to 

withdraw the supply of that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Then I would say that 

shouldn't be the law. The reason it shouldn't be the 

law is because that ingot may, by either withdrawing or, 

in fact, raising his price way above a competitive level 

and charging just no room to remain in business, is 

trying to drive out possible new entrants into the ingot 

stage of the business. And the fabricators are a number 

one out there as possibilities to break down the 

monopolist in ingot.

 And if that is the motive, as shown by the 

behavior, there should be a section 2 claim. If you 

want to argue that straight on the merits, what's the 

answer to that argument?

Official - Subject to Final Review 

MR. PANNER: The answer to that argument, 

Your Honor, is the one that Trinko offers, is that it's 

very important in establishing the antitrust rules to 

recognize the incentive that those rules will create for 

investment and for innovation.

 If the monopolist is forced to share the 

benefit of the monopoly with downstream rivals on the 

basis there is potential entry, that is going to be a 

significant disincentive to innovation at the upstream 

level. And the establishment of clear rules, ones that 

recognize that in the general run of cases there is not 

going to be harm and recognizes that the very scrutiny 

of that conduct will deter beneficial conduct and 

beneficial innovation and beneficial investment by the 

upstream monopolist, that recognition is the one that 

argues in favor of saying, in the absence of a duty to 

deal, where -- where the wholesale input could be 

withdraw from the market and where, therefore, the 

incremental harm from a price squeeze is really quite 

hard to identify. But that in that circumstance it is 

inappropriate to recognize any sort of a duty under 

section 2.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Just out of curiosity, is 

there a place where in this case the plaintiffs could 

go, a place which has a label "regulator" under it?

MR. PANNER: Yes, there is, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And that place is --

MR. PANNER: The Federal Communications 

Commission.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So we needn't reach the 

issue in this case?

 MR. PANNER: Well, Your Honor, I think that 

the -- significant regulation is not necessary. I agree 

with Your Honor that that is a factor that the Court 

could allow to be placed somehow on the scale. But the 

analysis that took place in Trinko is, first of all, 

whether there is an antitrust duty there at all and 

whether to extend it in light of the regulatory scheme 

that existed. And so, in this case, even in the absence 

of regulation, there should be no duty under section 2.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: With respect to your 

argument that there is going to be an upstream 

disincentive to investment in the monopolist if we do 

not come up with a clear rule that you want, are we at a 

stage or is the fashion of economics at a stage where we 

can say that there is a clear consensus supporting your 

argument?

 And if the answer is no, then isn't the only 

sensible thing for this Court to do to is leave it to 

rule of greedy?

MR. PANNER: Your Honor, I think there is a 

consensus in all of the scholar literature that was 

cited by the American Antitrust Institute, there wasn't 

anyone who supported, there was no scholar who supported 

the recognition of a price squeeze claim under section 

2. 	 I do think that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: For the reasons you gave, 

in effect, the investment disincentive?

 MR. PANNER: Well, I think the scholarly 

literature that explains the recognition of price 

squeeze duty would be harmful does indeed rely on the 

sorts of reasons that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Is that, in effect, 

uncontested within the profession except for the 

margins?

 MR. PANNER: I would assume as in any 

academic discipline, there would be those who are trying 

to find counterexamples. But I think the point there 

and one for example Professor Carlton stresses in his 

article and stressed another scholarly works is that the 

search for the rare case itself can cause very grave 

harm in the conduct that is following.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I follow the argument. The 

trouble I have that I have is I don't know whether, in 

the practical sense, that argument is a significant

argument or not. I don't know what's going on out 

there. And unless we reach the point in which the 

economic literature makes this a kind of slam dunk 

decision, then it seems for me the only thing for a 

Court to do is leave it for reasoning and analysis.

 MR. PANNER: Well, I think that the Brooke 

decision -- and as reaffirmed the answer to that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Is there --

MR. PANNER: There is a certain kinds of 

conduct where it is possible to create a model where 

there would be some negative consequences of the 

conduct, but that the very search for it risks deterring 

conduct that is of obvious benefit to the consumers. 

And that's true here.

 The recognition of an independent price 

squeeze duty would deter retail price reductions that 

are immediately beneficial to consumers, and it deters 

entry into the downstream market by a vertical -- by a 

wholesale monopolist who may then encounter a duty to 

protect downstream rivals; and, of course, it would 

deter voluntary dealing.

 And I think that that you know, discussions 

with my client reflect that this is a real effect, that 

they are on the margin, the concern about the potential 

for litigation makes investment and certainly

2 claim against a vertically integrated company by 

alleging nothing more than a margin-based price squeeze, 

one of two outcomes will result. Either the vertically 

integrated company will have to raise its retail prices 

to its consumers or it will be forced to share the 

benefits of its lawful monopoly with its rivals by 

lowering its wholesale price. Either outcome is 

inconsistent with this Court's antitrust jurisprudence.

 As we know from Trinko, in the absence of a 

duty to deal, a monopolist cannot be forced to share the 

benefits of its lawful monopoly with its rivals at any 

particular turn.

in your colleague's suggestion that we should overrule 

the Alcoa case?

 MS. MAYNARD: I do think -- the government 

believes the Alcoa case is wrongly decided, 

Justice Stevens.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you think it's 

necessary to do so to decide this case?

 MS. MAYNARD: I mean if -- I mean, one could 

say that Judge Hand didn't necessarily recognize a price 

squeeze claim standing alone, because he has some 

language about, to the effect of perhaps this isn't an 

independent wrong, but the way that he analyzed it 

separately and the way courts have ruled -- have relied 

upon it, to suggest that a mere margin-based price 

squeeze without more, does state a section 2 claim, is 

incorrect.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: My question is really, you 

think it's necessary to overrule that decision in order 

to decide this case correctly?

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, I don't think 

technically it needs overruling. It's a Second Circuit 

decision, and I think it is -- has in effect --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do we have to say it was 

decided incorrectly?

it was decided incorrectly.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's not my question.

 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, Justice Stevens, I think 

it's incorrect.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I know you think it's 

incorrect. I am asking whether you think we have to say 

it's incorrect in order to decide this case correctly?

 MS. MAYNARD: Yes, unless you're willing to 

say Judge Hand didn't hold that a price squeeze claim 

without more is an independent theory that supports the 

section 2 claim. As long as you think that's what he 

did hold, and many people do think that is what he held, 

then, yes, you do need to say that it was wrongly 

decided and the government believes it is wrongly 

decided, and that it has already been overruled.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, why -- why can't we 

just say Trinko is a case, as is this case, where there 

is a regulator? So, in fact, if you, Mr. Plaintiff, are 

upset about this, and feel you are being very badly 

treated and squeezed out under circumstances where 

competition might be hurt as a result, then you go to 

the Commission, and you say: "This is an unreasonable 

price. " All right?

 Now I thought Trinko was a case where that 

was involved.

MS. MAYNARD: The regulation, 

Justice Breyer, in Trinko was relevant for two reasons 

that are not relevant to the question before the Court 

here. First, the Court looked to the regulations, the 

regulatory duty, and made a decision whether the 

regulatory duty itself created an antitrust duty to 

deal, and the Court held it did not.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

 MS. MAYNARD: That holding is relevant here, 

because it means that Petitioners' regulatory duty to 

deal -- duty to deal does not create an antitrust duty 

to deal. But then the Court went on and looked at the 

Court's existing antitrust jurisprudence, to decide 

whether or not the Court's antitrust jurisprudence 

recognized a duty to deal in that circumstance, and 

concluded it did not. It only looked to the regulation 

that --

JUSTICE BREYER: But it -- it -- it said 

that the issue in that case was a duty to deal. That's 

not the issue in this case. And it was about Aspen, and 

whether you had a duty to deal. And the Court said no, 

you don't have a special duty to deal.

 Here we are dealing with quite a different 

thing. We are dealing with someone who has chosen to 

deal in the past, and they are setting a price such that

the plaintiff thinks he is being squeezed out.

 Now I can't find anything in Trinko that 

tells me I can't say, we're at least not worried about 

this where there is a regulator that you can go and 

complain to. And if that's so, I don't have to reach 

the question of whether Judge Hand is right or wrong. 

What's wrong with what I just said?

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, a couple of things. To 

me, this case, as the case comes to the Court there is 

no antitrust duty to deal.

 And the -- the Petitioners here, the 

district court determined weren't dealing voluntarily, 

Justice Breyer; they were dealing as a result of 

regulatory compulsion; but be that as it may, the -- the 

important point from Trinko that is relevant here is 

that a lawful monopolist without an antitrust duty to 

deal has no duty to deal on any particular terms; and 

Trinko specifically says that a lawful monopolist is 

entitled to charge the monopoly price.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But --

MS. MAYNARD: In that case --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, I didn't -- I didn't 

want to interrupt your answer, go ahead -- just go 

ahead.

wholesale price and possibility of lowering that, 

Justice Breyer, off the table; and without the top 

pincer as it were, there is no price squeeze; and that 

leaves the Respondents with only a claim that the 

Petitioner's prices are too low. And whenever a party 

claims that its rival's prices are too low for it to be 

able to compete, that triggers all of the concerns that 

this Court expressed in Brooke Group.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't it -- isn't it the 

case that if in effect, we -- we refuse to come down 

with a -- the kind of blanket answer, with a rule that 

you want, that the parties here can go out -- the 

complaining party here can go back to the FCC and say 

there's something wrong with your wholesale pricing 

order; look what's happening; and the FCC may adjust the 

wholesale pricing order as a result of that.

 And if that is true, if they can do that, 

and the FCC can act, isn't that a good reason for us not 

to be developing new antitrust doctrine, if there is no 

need of it?

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, the government's view is 

that the current antitrust doctrine already forecloses 

this claim for the reasons that I was explaining. Now 

if the Court were going to consider this as whether were 

you going to reach out and extend the antitrust law --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you're certainly 

asking us to -- at the very least -- to clarify the 

significance of Alcoa. You're -- you are asking for an 

articulation of something -- of the significance of 

Alcoa today, which we have not done. So in that sense 

you are asking for something more than we've got on the 

books now; and my question is, if the agency in effect 

can deal with -- with -- with what the -- the monopolist 

is concerned with, and what the entrant is concerned 

with, why do we have to take -- why is it wise for us to 

take the step of making or clarifying new antitrust law?

 MS. MAYNARD: Well, the -- the Respondents 

here were attempting to press, and the Ninth Circuit has 

allowed them to go forward on, a treble damages claim 

where they seek $40 million under a pure margin-based 

price squeeze theory. And in the government's view, 

that -- such a rule would protect only competitors, and 

doesn't allege any harm to the competitive process, 

which section 2 requires.

 Whether or not the FCC has regulatory 

authority or not over the basic question -- over its own 

issues -- isn't relevant to the antitrust question 

before the Court here, which is, does the Court's 

current antitrust jurisprudence foreclose such a pure 

margin-based price squeeze.

And the government is not saying that there 

might not be some exclusionary conduct, Justice Breyer, 

that could someday be alleged, if there was an attempt 

say, to claim an attempt of the upstream market, as you 

were positing. That's not the claim here, nor in most 

price squeeze claims of which I'm aware; the claim is 

that they are attempting to monopolize the downstream 

market. The government does not mean to foreclose; at 

this point it has recognized there are myriad ways in 

which companies can engage in exclusionary conduct. So 

the government's position is a narrow one, which is that 

a pure margin-based price squeeze, in the absence of a 

duty to deal -- that is, this person who is dealing with 

me is -- is charging me too much, so that I can't 

compete against it at retail -- that is nothing more 

than proof that they can't compete.

 That doesn't show any harm to the 

competitive process, which is what this Court has 

repeatedly held is required for liability under section 

2, and for good reason. And Justice Souter, in response 

to your question, the government is not saying that it 

is not plausible that there isn't some anticompetitive 

conduct that will go unchecked as a result of such a 

rule, but the Court's analysis in Brooke Group is the 

proper one, which is that ultimately what you will be

doing is telling a retail level competitor that it must 

raise its prices in order to prevent liability.

 That really isn't, as Mr. Panner said, worth 

the candle, and it creates the risk of chilling 

legitimate price cutting, and it puts the courts in the 

role, essentially, of being a regulator, maybe not just 

at one level, but at two.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So you are saying in 

practical terms that if there is a squeeze, it's highly 

unlikely it's going to be anything but a Brooke Group 

kind of squeeze, and therefore it's --

MS. MAYNARD: That if there is something 

anticompetitive going on, that section 2 cares about --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes.

 MS. MAYNARD: -- they would need to allege 

that the Petitioners' retail prices are below some 

appropriate measure of the Petitioners' costs; and what 

they want to do is essentially what Alcoa does, which is 

why it's mistaken, is it attributes -- it would 

attribute to Petitioners the wholesale price they are 

willing to sell their upstream input to others, and what 

Brooke Group makes clear is that the relevant cost is 

the internal cost to the Petitioners.

-- everything you said is applicable to a predatory 

price claim as well as a price squeeze?

 MS. MAYNARD: We believe that if they can 

allege the elements of a predatory pricing claim under 

Brooke Group, then they would still have that claim even 

in the absence of a duty to deal, and then labeling it a 

predatory price squeeze doesn't add anything. The court 

just clarified that there isn't a separate price squeeze 

liability. But there would remain a predatory pricing 

theory under Brooke Group if those allegations could be 

met.

 Does that answer your question?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. Thank you, 

counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAXWELL M. BLECHER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. BLECHER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I don't have a white flag and I don't think 

we particularly have given up, but let me start by 

suggesting that you don't need to decide the totality of 

Alcoa. I think you need to vacate the decision of the 

Ninth Circuit -- not because it's erroneous, but because 

it's incomplete. Just send the case back to the

district court to consider Judge Gould's suggestion that 

we file an amended complaint.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't understand what 

you just said. Judge Gould dissented. He said the 

Ninth Circuit majority was wrong. And you're urging us 

to accept Judge Gould's position.

 MR. BLECHER: Not -- yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How can we do that 

without saying that the majority was wrong?

 MR. BLECHER: There is a difference between 

being wrong and being incomplete. The Ninth Circuit 

decision responded to a very narrow question certified 

by the district judge, which was whether or not price 

squeeze taken as a generic violation was subsumed or not 

subsumed by the Trinko decision. It answered that 

question correctly; but in doing that, it did not 

consider whether or not price squeeze survived -- the 

living margin part of price squeezing survived Brooke.

 And to that extent, Judge Gould picked up 

the -- the -- the argument and said, in effect, 

especially in a regulated industry where the wholesale 

price is -- is regulated, the offense of price squeeze 

becomes predatory pricing, just as in a primary 

Robinson-Patman case, the offense becomes predatory 

pricing.

There is no more Robinson-Patman primary 

line law. It's -- it's -- like it or not -- I'm not 

saying we like it; I'm not saying we agree with it, but 

the state of the law is that when you are challenging a 

monopolist price under section 2 of the Sherman Act, 

Brooke and its predecessors determine the legality of 

the conduct. And that's -- and that's what we are 

recognizing here.

 Now, understand that when the issue was 

framed to the Ninth Circuit, the district judge, in a 

footnote, said he thought that they ought to consider 

the Brooke issue, but he did not decide that question, 

and he did not certify it. So when the Ninth Circuit --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you don't certify 

questions; you certify orders. And in the certification 

of this order, I take it, your position was in support 

of what the district court did and in support of what 

the court of appeals did, correct?

 MR. BLECHER: Partly, Justice Kennedy. What 

-- in part what we said was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You made -- you made --

you made an argument, or did you not, that is consistent 

with what the court of appeals did hold in this case?

that's what they held. I view what they did is answer a

question: "Does a pure price squeeze get subsumed by 

Trinko as it involves the question that we heard 

articulated, the duty to deal?" Now --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was the court of appeals' 

decision consistent with the argument that you made to 

the court of appeals?

 MR. BLECHER: It is consistent, but it 

didn't say, we endorse Alcoa, and it didn't say we 

require a -- a -- predatory pricing. It was silent on 

the elements of the offense of a price squeeze. It 

answered this very narrow question: Does price squeeze 

generically -- is it an existing kind of antitrust 

violation that is not subsumed by the Trinko rule?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, I am 

confused --

MR. BLECHER: That's all that was decided.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I am confused about 

what you mean when you say "the price squeeze claim."

 MR. BLECHER: A non-predatory --

claim?

what Mr. Panner told you, this is not proxy pricing.

sell the DSL transfer to itself, to its own affiliate 

and to outside independent companies like the plaintiffs 

at the same price.

significant or partial element of your Brooke Group 

claim, or is it totally irrelevant?

 MR. BLECHER: More or less irrelevant. Only 

-- it only sets the benchmark for the costs that the 

retail affiliate is selling below. There -- there is no 

question the retail affiliate, in many of the time 

periods covered by the complaint, sold below -- just the 

DSL transport; and in addition to that, they threw in a 

modem, installation, and online services. So, if you 

put those into the cost bundle, they will be below cost 

for the -- substantially the entire damage period that 

we are complaining about; and --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is the first -- is the 

first time that you indicated that you were in agreement 

with the Gould dissent in your -- the brief that you 

filed here in this Court?

 MR. BLECHER: Yes, directly, but we did

the Petitioners' attorney that that was your position so 

you could have asked for a stipulation on the point.

 MR. BLECHER: Well, I think what you are 

overlooking, though, is when we went to the Ninth 

Circuit, we endorsed Judge Wilson's suggestion that they 

decide the Brooke issue, so that, when we went back, we 

would have guidance as to what the appropriate standard 

was. They elected not to deal with either Alcoa or 

Brooke. They just decided the very narrow question he 

certified.

 In the Ninth Circuit, AT&T said, to the 

Ninth Circuit, don't reach the Brooke issue; you don't 

need to reach the Brooke issue to decide this case, even 

though the complaint you are ruling on has been 

superseded by an allegation in an amended complaint that 

states a Brooke violation, or purported to or attempted 

to state a Brooke violation.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So can we write this 

following, we say: In the district court, as of this 

moment, there is no complaint that alleges the price 

squeeze theory of the majority of the Ninth Circuit. 

There is a complaint that alleges a price theory under 

Brooke -- a predatory pricing under Brooke Group. That 

is what is there. Nothing else is there. Therefore,

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Breyer's 

draft judgment said we would vacate the decision below. 

Shouldn't we reverse it, because if we think on the 

price squeeze claim, as distinct from the Brooke Group 

claim, the Ninth Circuit was wrong. You don't just 

throw it out and let everybody go home. You say whether 

it was right or wrong. And if you are saying it's 

wrong, we would reverse.

 MR. BLECHER: That's certainly as an option, 

but I think it would be more appropriate to vacate it 

because I don't consider that they did a direct frontal 

assault on Brooke. They didn't consider Brooke because 

AT&T suggested that they didn't need to read it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The Ninth Circuit had a 

precedent that it thought it was following. Was it 

Anaheim?

 MR. BLECHER: Yes.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So isn't it important 

that if you think that they were wrong and we agree with 

you, that we get -- not just vacate but say you were 

wrong on the law; you were wrong in this case, and you 

were wrong in Anaheim. And then the Ninth Circuit will 

not follow those decisions anymore.

 MR. BLECHER: Well, that's if you want to 

approach the rules and decide that there can only be a 

price squeeze claim if the price is predatory. You may 

want to get there. I'm saying you don't need to get 

there here.

 You could simply say the Ninth Circuit 

decision, I think, correctly decided the very narrow 

question that was presented by the certification order. 

They abided AT&T's suggestion not to go outside that 

order, and, therefore, their decision can be viewed as 

incomplete because they didn't go on to discuss what the 

elements of a price squeeze claim were.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You are saying we 

don't have to cross the Rubicon because your Brooke 

Group predatory pricing claim will say that the prices 

here were below cost?

 MR. BLECHER: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So we don't have to 

consider, I guess, what I thought we had to consider --

or the vitality of Alcoa. You --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And you are not 

going to amend your complaint to raise such a claim on 

remand?

 MR. BLECHER: I am going to file an amended 

complaint that will be limited entirely to the Brooke 

predatory pricing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which you understand 

to require that the retail prices be below cost?

 MR. BLECHER: And we are very comfortable 

with that. The answer is yes, and we are comfortable 

with that. But we haven't given up, and we live to 

fight another day on another field.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But if we follow your 

proposal, then, you could, in a case filed next week or 

the week after we decide the case, assert exactly the 

same claim that you asserted here originally, and that 

would be good law in the Ninth Circuit?

JUSTICE SOUTER: Either you or anybody else 

in the Ninth Circuit?

 MR. BLECHER: I think if you abide my idea 

how to deal with this, the issue of Alcoa's vitality 

would remain open to be decided in another case on 

another day.

 JUSTICE BREYER: If we vacate, you would be 

in favor of vacating their decision?

 MR. BLECHER: Yes, because a vacation can 

rest on grounds that the Ninth Circuit did not reach the 

issue. They said, we are prepared to abide Judge 

Gould's view that, in a regulated industry, we can only 

have a, quote, "price squeeze" if the price is 

predatory.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the reason you 

think we should vacate is not because the Ninth Circuit 

didn't decide the question, but because you are willing 

not to press it?

 MR. BLECHER: No. I don't think they 

decided the Alcoa question. That's the way I read the 

decision. Because I know what was certified. I know 

what they said. They responded only to a very narrow 

question, and AT&T said don't venture beyond that. 

Don't --

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD M. BRUNELL

 ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN ANTITRUST

 INSTITUTE, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. BRUNELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 We think the proper disposition of this case 

is to vacate the decision below and to remand and let 

the district court decide whether the complaint should 

be amended or not. Vacating the judgment would amount 

to a dismissal with prejudice of the price squeeze 

claim, and, therefore, this Court would have nothing to

decide.

 The Court doesn't need to reach out to 

decide the vitality of Alcoa, the question of which is 

not even presented by the question raised in the cert 

petition. And there are many reasons why -- and I am 

happy to address why Alcoa should remain good law, if 

the Court wishes to get into that. However, we don't 

think it's necessary.

 On the specific issue here, if the Court 

decides not to vacate the judgment below and wants to 

examine the correctness of the Ninth Circuit judgment, 

the specific issue of whether the absence of a duty to 

deal thereby dooms any kind of claim -- a price squeeze 

claim or really any other type of antitrust claim, 

including a predatory pricing claim, if the regulators 

can address the issue.

 We think that is -- that is the case, that 

that is the incorrect view of the law, and indeed, to 

some extent we agree with the Solicitor General that the 

existence of a regulatory remedy is not sufficient to 

bar a price-squeeze claim because there is no exhaustion 

requirement under the antitrust laws, and this Court's 

decision in Trinko, as the Solicitor General suggested 

when it looked at the regulatory remedies, that was with 

respect to expanding section 2 enforcement and not with

respect to traditional antitrust claims, which Alcoa 

certainly is.

 Now, with respect to the issue of the duty 

to deal. What does that mean, that there's no duty to 

deal? In our view --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that means 

they don't have to deal. They don't have to sell you 

the stuff if they don't want to.

 MR. BRUNELL: In our view, it means that a 

court has found that there's no liability in the event 

of a refusal to deal, which is what Trinko did. And one 

has to ask whether the rationale for finding no 

liability for refusal to deal also applies to a 

predatory -- excuse me, a price squeeze claim.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You mean a Brooke 

Group retail price squeeze claim?

 MR. BRUNELL: No, I mean a traditional price 

squeeze claim. That doesn't have to meet the Brooke 

Group standard. Mr. Panner suggested --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this: I'm not 

familiar on this point. Apart from Alcoa, what are the 

cases applying a traditional price squeeze claim?

 MR. BRUNELL: We've listed them in our 

brief. I believe that 9 out of the 12 circuits, not 

including the Federal Circuit, have recognized an

Alcoa-type price squeeze claim. And in the other three 

circuits, district courts -- in each of the other three 

circuits, district courts have recognized an Alcoa-type 

claim.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you agree with your 

opponent's submission that antitrust scholars uniformly 

agree that the Alcoa case was incorrectly decided?

 MR. BRUNELL: No, I do not agree with that. 

And, indeed, our brief cites an eminent professor, John 

Vickers at Oxford, an economist who supports a 

traditional Alcoa-type claim, that is a claim based on 

what we've call the transfer price test, where one looks 

at the margin between the retail and wholesale prices 

and asks whether that is sufficient to cover the 

monopolist's downstream costs. Professor Vickers --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Does he support --

MR. BRUNELL: Pardon me?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I thought somebody else was 

-- does he support recognition of that claim in the 

circumstances in which there was regulatory involvement 

like the FCC here?

 MR. BRUNELL: I believe he does, Your Honor. 

I believe the European Commission also recognizes such a 

claim in the presence of regulation. I believe the 

Federal Trade Commission recognizes such a claim.

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why do we need to?

 MR. BRUNELL: Why do we need to? Because 

a -- you mean in the absence why can't regulation handle 

this or why do we worry about the anticompetitive 

effects of a price squeeze?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Why can't regulation handle 

it?

 MR. BRUNELL: Well, in this case, regulation 

-- simply the -- the regulation that is referred to is 

simply the prospect of the complainant going to the 

Federal Communications Commission and simply asking for 

some kind of post hoc relief, as opposed to a situation 

as in Town of Concord or in Trinko where the regulation 

at issue was quite extensive. All of the conduct at 

issue in Trinko was heavily regulated. And in this 

case, we have wholesale rates that are lightly regulated 

and retail rates that are completely unregulated.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So why couldn't you -- why 

wouldn't you -- couldn't you go to the FCC or the other 

regulator and say: Regulator, they are selling me this 

widget or line at a dollar. All right. That's 

considerably higher than their costs of producing it. 

And, in addition to that, they sell the same service I 

do for $1.20, even though it costs me or would cost any 

human being at least 60 cents to provide that added

service. So we are asking you to tell them that if they 

continue to sell it at $1.20, they lower their wholesale 

price to us so that we only have to pay at most 80 

cents, or whatever the right number is there.

 I mean, they have someone to complain to. 

They could make the same complaint. I'm quite surprised 

that Vickers has written that under the circumstances I 

have outlined that there is a valid price squeeze 

antitrust claim or that the British Commission has held 

that.

 I would be very interested to know the 

citation of that. Because he may have done. I don't 

read everything.

 MR. BRUNELL: The European commission --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not saying the European 

Commission. They have done all kinds of things. I am 

saying the -- the --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: I am saying the British 

Monopolies or Restricted Practices Commission of which 

Vickers was the head. I agree with you that he is very 

knowledgeable, but I would be surprised if he had 

written contrary to what I just said in that example. 

But I am often surprised and willing to read it.

relationship between the regulatory authority to address 

a question and whether an antitrust claim exists is 

normally decided on the basis of implied antitrust 

immunity. The mere existence of a regulatory remedy is 

insufficient under this Court's precedent in Credit 

Suisse, certainly, for -- for having implied immunity.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, would you say that 

absent the regulatory regime, there would be a duty to 

deal here?

 MR. BRUNELL: Absent the regulatory regime, 

would there be a duty to deal? Would the Court have 

found -- in this case, the Petitioners may well have 

voluntarily dealt with the Respondents --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. No. My question was: 

Was there a duty to deal under the antitrust laws? 

Because it seems to me the only reason that there is a 

duty to deal is because of the regulation. So, you use 

the regulation in order to establish the duty, but then 

you don't want to go to the regulators to regulate the 

price. And it seems to me that that's inconsistent.

 MR. BRUNELL: Whether there is a duty to 

deal can only be answered by asking whether a violation 

-- a refusal to deal would constitute an antitrust 

violation. And in this case, had -- had there been no 

required dealing and, therefore, no dealing whatsoever,

then the issue of antitrust duty to deal would be 

totally academic. Furthermore --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's still seems to me 

that you, therefore, must rely on the regulation to 

establish the initial predicate of a duty to deal. And 

You rely on the regulation that far, but you don't want 

to go to the regulators to -- to argue about the price. 

You want us to look at regulation first and antitrust 

law second.

 Why can't we just look at this case as 

purely antitrust; and then, as Justice Breyer said, if 

it's a regulatory problem, go to the regulators.

 MR. BRUNELL: Well, the mere fact that there 

is a regulatory duty to deal does not completely oust 

antitrust. Otherwise, there would be no predatory-

pricing claim.

 The petitioner -- the -- the respondent 

injured by a predatory-pricing claim could also go to 

the FCC, presumably. And we don't -- and no one is 

contending that the -- that a predatory-pricing claim 

wouldn't lie and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would that lie here first? 

I mean, you don't -- you don't think -- you don't think 

that the regulatory agency would be acting properly if 

it prescribed a price that was predatory or allowed the

charge of a price that was predatory, would you?

 MR. BRUNELL: No. I -- I don't think the 

regulators would -- would permit predatory pricing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They wouldn't permit it. 

Then is there -- is there no such thing as primary 

agency responsibility to take care of that problem 

rather than rushing into a court and take care of it 

through the -- through the Sherman Act?

 MR. BRUNELL: There certainly is the 

doctrine of primary jurisdiction, which arises typically 

when the agency is already dealing with a problem and 

not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they are dealing with 

the problem there. They are decreeing the price that 

could be charged, aren't they? Don't they have to 

approve the pricing?

 MR. BRUNELL: They certainly don't approve 

the retail pricing, no. The retail pricing in this case 

is entirely unregulated. It purports to be in a 

competitive market.

 But let me back up for one second. The --

the regulatory regime here is quite different from the 

one in Trinko. In -- in Trinko you had a regulatory 

duty that essentially required the monopolist to 

cooperate with its rivals in the monopoly market in

order to dismantle the monopoly.

 In this case you have a regulation that is 

designed to ensure that the monopolist does not extend 

its monopoly power into unregulated competitive markets. 

And so the -- surely, the regulators focus -- can focus 

on the wholesale rates and ensure in this case that the 

rate that the monopolist charges itself is the same as 

the rate it charges its rivals with the object of 

ensuring a competitive downstream market.

 But that doesn't mean that that should oust 

antitrust law. The regulators may, in fact, think that 

it's important to have antitrust law available to 

enforce claims in order for them to cut back on their 

regulations. And indeed, in this case, when the -- when 

AT&T sought to de-tariff its wholesale offering, the 

regulators referred to the fact that one of the 

justifications for de-tariffing would be that the 

antitrust laws would be available in case there were a 

problem.

 So the -- the relationship between antitrust 

and regulation is symbiotic and complementary. And we 

would suggest that in this case the mere fact that the 

district court determined that the complaint of 

insufficient cooperation by the Petitioner in this case 

did not state a claim for refusal to deal shouldn't

preclude a -- a price-squeeze claim any more than it 

should preclude a predatory pricing claim, which the 

government and the Petitioners seem to concede would 

still lie.

 Now, finally, this point about an 

over-deterrence and whether there is any evidence that 

any monopolist at any time has ever been deterred from 

engaging in legitimate retail price-cutting or efficient 

vertical integration, I would submit that there is 

absolutely no evidence anywhere in the literature, no 

empirical evidence, that there is a problem of over-

deterrence.

 And had there been a problem over the last 

63 years that Alcoa has existed, one would think it 

wouldn't be too hard to find evidence of that. There is 

no evidence.

 Furthermore, in Brooke Group the Court did 

not simply rely on the risk of over-deterrence as a 

basis for holding that above-cost price-cutting was not 

actionable. In Brooke Group it relied on two factors: 

The fact -- the fear that making above-cost 

price-cutting illegal would deter legitimate 

price-cutting, but also the fact that above-cost 

price-cutting would not eliminate equally efficient 

rivals. Any equally efficient rival could meet an

above-cost price. The price squeeze doctrine under the 

transfer price test protects equally efficient 

downstream rivals.

 So that issue is quite different. The 

deterrence issue is -- is quite different when you --

when have a price squeeze. Furthermore, the notion that 

a monopolist would respond to a price squeeze complaint 

-- thank you, Your Honors.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your 

sentence there.

 MR. BRUNELL: The notion that they would 

respond to a price squeeze complaint by raising their 

retail price, rather than lowering their wholesale 

price, I would submit is certainly as belied by the 

facts of the Alcoa case which in the district court 

reflect that when the government started looking into 

the price squeeze and the price squeeze was ended, it 

was ended voluntarily by Alcoa lowering its wholesale 

price, not raising its retail price.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 Now, Mr. Panner, you have two minutes

to make. First of all, I think, in agreement with 

Justice Breyer and Justice Kennedy, and others, I do 

think that the presence of a regulatory remedy here is a 

critical factor arguing in favor of reversal of the 

Ninth Circuit's decision.

 The second point that I really want to make 

is the importance of clear rules. In the antitrust 

context where we are talking about a system of rules 

that is going to govern decisionmaking by businesses 

where most of those decisions are never going to lead to 

litigation or are never going to come before the courts, 

it is critically important to have clear rules that 

avoid deterring beneficial conduct, that avoid having 

the rules themselves harm consumers.

 I think that was the point that 

Justice Alito and Justice Ginsburg were getting at in 

the questioning. It is critical to adopt a decision on 

the merits explaining why the Ninth Circuit's price 

squeeze decision -- not just here, but in the prior 

decision, in City of Anaheim -- is incorrect and 

inconsistent with this Court's precedents.

 And, more broadly, it is critical to have a 

clear rule stating that in the absence of a duty to 

deal, an allegation of price squeeze, it doesn't stay a 

claim.

district court -- and the amended complaint at a minimum 

is supplying one version of the facts that might try to 

be elaborated -- fail to state a claim under this 

Court's precedents. The clear gravamen of 

that complaint, indeed the explicit gravamen of that 

complaint, was that the margin between the wholesale 

price and retail price was insufficient. And --
