(10:03 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’ll hear 

argument first this morning in case 08-1470, 

Berghuis v. Thompkins. 

Mr. Restuccia. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF B. ERIC RESTUCCIA 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

In rejecting Mr. Thompkins's Miranda claim 

and ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the 

Michigan courts did not unreasonably apply clearly 

established Supreme Court precedent. I plan to focus on 

the Miranda claim. 

Now, with respect to the Miranda claim, there 

really are two distinct inquiries at issue. The first 

is whether Mr. Thompkins impliedly waived his rights 

under the Fifth Amendment and, second, whether he 

invoked his right to remain silent during a police 

interview. 

Regarding the waiver question, this Court 

established in Butler that there may be an implied 

waiver, even where a suspect remains silent after having 

received his Miranda warnings, where that suspect

knowingly receives his rights and there is a course of 

conduct that indicates waiver. 

The Michigan courts here did not 

unreasonably conclude that Mr. Thompkins had impliedly 

waived his rights where he expressly acknowledged his 

rights under -- from his form. After having read out loud 

from that form, he participated in a limited fashion 

during the interview. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But he didn't -- he 

didn't waive them. And quite unlike Butler -- Butler, 

if I have it right, said, "I'll talk to you." So that 

was a statement --

MR. RESTUCCIA: But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that he was waiving 

the right to remain silent. He volunteered to talk. 

Here there was no such indication that there was a 

waiver of his right to remain silent. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Although in Butler this 

Court noted that -- that Butler himself had remained 

silent and did not answer the -- answer at all, or 

remained silent when asked whether he wished to waive 

his right to counsel. So the -- the standard that was 

established from which the Michigan courts relied is 

really on this -- this language of the standard 

established from Butler, that you can -- you can imply

waiver from the knowing reception, and then a course of 

conduct, because the -- the inference can be drawn from 

the words and actions of the person interrogated. And 

here --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me 

without more detail, which is what the circuit court 

said, about what the limited responses -- I'm using your 

word -- were. How do we -- how can we imply waiver? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Meaning if all he said 

was, yes, I want them in, that's much different than 

saying, if someone had asked him, do you want to leave, 

and he shakes his head no. The latter might imply to me 

that he waived, but the former certainly would be 

neutral. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: I have to 

carefully delineate between waiver and invocation. So 

here the waiver occurs at the time that he is asked the 

series of questions: Do you believe in God? Do you 

pray to God? Did you pray for forgiveness --

JUSTICE BREYER: That happened about 2 

hours and 15 minutes into the exercise, didn't it? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: That's right. It happened 

near the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So -- so what we

have here is a course of conduct, 2 hours and 15 minutes 

of saying nothing. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, we – 

JUSTICE BREYER: Would you say that 

that’s -- that's gone past the point where --

MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, this -- if you’re 

looking at what has been clearly established for this 

Court, this Court has never -- I mean, one of the 

arguments raised against the position I’m 

advocating is that there is an immediacy requirement. 

Well, this Court in Butler didn't say that the waiver 

had to occur immediately. 

JUSTICE BREYER: In Butler he said: I will 

talk to you, but I am not signing any forms. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: That's right. But if you 

look at what’s the clearly established law -- this Court 

identified the standard, what can be inferred from the 

words and actions of the person interrogated. And if 

you look at what the two --

JUSTICE BREYER: What they say is, “a course 

of conduct” -- we will not hold -- “This does not mean a 

defendant's silence, coupled with an understanding and a 

course of conduct indicating waiver, may never support a 

conclusion....” 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Right.

JUSTICE BREYER: But the prosecution's 

burden is great. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. And if -- if you 

look at the two aspects of what constitutes a waiver, 

it's knowing and intelligent, and voluntary. At the 

time that Mr. Thompkins gave his answer to that series 

of questions, there’s nothing in the course of that 

interview that suggested that no longer did he know that 

he didn't have to answer questions. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But going back to Justice 

Sotomayor's question, is there anything during the 2 

hours and 15 minutes that could suggest a waiver? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: The -- the -- the waiver 

occurs at the time that he answered the question. So the 

answer is that he didn't waiver before then, but that --

it still is evidence to show that that course -- that 

nothing the police had done -- there were no threats --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what do we do with 

our case law that says that you can't infer waiver 

simply from the confession? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, we have said 

that. So that’s pretty clearly established statement --

MR. RESTUCCIA: The courts on direct review 

have allowed -- where there’s a knowing reception of 

one's rights, have allowed the answers themselves to 

provide the evidence that the person did waive his 

rights. In fact --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I think certainly 

in -- in Butler, if someone in their confession says, I 

know I don't have to talk to you, but I want to, that 

that would be using those words. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: But that would be --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So how can you say --

MR. RESTUCCIA: That would be an express 

waiver, though. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: How can you say that 

an appeal to someone's religious position after 2 and 

a quarter hours is a voluntary waiver? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, if you look at what 

this Court has provided in terms of guidance regarding 

what constitutes a lengthy interrogation, Miranda notes 

that a lengthy interrogation would be strong evidence 

against there being a valid waiver. But what 

this Court has determined to be a lengthy interrogation 

were interrogations of much longer duration. In fact, 

Miranda even talks about --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: We didn't say -- we don't 

have any decision that says the police are home free for 

2 and a quarter hours. You said that that this was not 

lengthy interrogation. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we -- we have no 

decision that says that the police, faced with a silent 

suspect, goes after that suspect, questioning him 

incessantly for 2 and -- 2 hours and 15 minutes, that 

that is not lengthy. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, I think it's important 

to remember that the factual record here was established 

by the State court, and the factual record isn't that he 

remained absolutely silent, but that he participated --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: He said "yeah," "no," and 

"I don't know." 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. But he was 

participating. There’s a fundamental difference between 

remaining absolutely silent and participating --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Wait. Do -- do we have any 

case that says that 2 and a quarter hours is too long? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: No, and in fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And that there can't be a 

waiver after 2 and a quarter hours?

that effect. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And, therefore, there’s no 

clearly established Supreme Court law that 2 and a 

quarter hours is too long. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: That's the position that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that the name of the 

game here? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: That's the position --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is there a clearly 

established rule that in all of the circumstances of the 

case, we can find that there is coercion, time being one 

aspect of those circumstances? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: I think that's right. And 

what -- one of the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And so that is a clearly 

established rule, and then it's a question whether 2 and 

a half, 3 and a half, 4 and a half suffices. -

MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. The -- the case that 

I cited was Frazier v. Cupp, in which the interview 

started at 5:00 p.m. and it finished at 6:45 p.m., and 

the Court called that an interrogation of short 

duration. And it is important to remember that this 

Court has stated expressly in Davis that once you have 

knowingly received your rights, that the knowing 

reception itself dispels the inherently coercive

aspect --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The question --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your -- your position 

is that if -- same facts, but it's 10 hours instead of 

2 and a half, is that a closer case, at least? For --

MR. RESTUCCIA: That's a very different 

case, because there is case law -- like I cited Blackburn 

was an interview that ran 8 or 9 hours, and this Court 

found that that person was probably incompetent or 

insane. But that duration is -- there's been guidance 

about that kind of long duration, whereas in our --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And does that show that – 

that the circumstances are coercive, so that even if there 

were a waiver it would be --

MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. That's the 

suggestion from Miranda, that a lengthy interrogation 

preceding the waiver can suggest the waiver was not 

valid. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The question, of 

course, is not whether we think 2 and a quarter hours 

under all the circumstances is -- is too long under our 

precedent. The question is, instead, whether it would be 

unreasonable for the State court to determine otherwise. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: That's right. And, ultimately, 

the question is what guidance is there to the State of

Michigan in applying the implied waiver doctrine to 

indicate that the implied waiver couldn't come after 2 

hours and 15 minutes of interaction in which it 

concluded that the -- that the suspect had been a 

willing participant. The testimony from detective 

Helgert, which -- he was the only person to testify at 

the evidentiary hearing, is that --

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought Miranda held that 

you can't question a person unless he waives his right. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: No, Miranda in fact talks 

about --

JUSTICE BREYER: You can question him even 

after he -- it's clear that he hadn't waived his right. 

Is that -- that's Miranda? Or at least that's unclear? 

Is that --

MR. RESTUCCIA: Warnings -- warnings is a 

prerequisite to questioning, but the waiver is not. In 

fact --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I'm not talking about 

the waiver. I'm saying, imagine that it's clear that a 

person hasn't waived his right. Now let's suppose he 

says, "I do not waive my right." Okay? 

Now, is it clear law that once he says "I do 

not waive my right," the police cannot continue to 

question him?

JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, yes. If that's clear 

law, would you say that at some point before the 2 hours 

and 15 minutes expires where they're continuously asking 

him questions and he says nothing, that it has become 

clear that he has not waived his right? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: No. The factual record --

JUSTICE BREYER: For the question is not 

this. The question is whether, after 2 hours and 

15 minutes of silence, it is clear -- it's nothing about 

Supreme Court law. Supreme Court law is clear: You 

cannot question him after he makes clear he hasn't 

waived his right. So then the question becomes, is it 

reasonable for a State court to say -- after 2 hours and 

15 minutes of asking questions and he says nothing, is 

it reasonable to hold that he has not -- conclude that 

he has not waived his rights? Is that the question? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Yes. The question as I see 

it is that -- let me see if I understand. Let me see if 

I understand your question. There’s a difference 

between refusing to waive, saying I will not waive my 

rights. Essentially if you make it an expressed statement

that you are unwilling to waive, then essentially it is 

in that case -- I want to keep this separate, but that 

would be an invocation: I do not wish to answer your 

questions. If you make a crystal-clear statement like 

that, it's a different question. 

But here Mr. Thompkins didn't say he was 

unwilling to waive. He’s participating. Now, you 

suggest that there was silence --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You’re saying there’s a 

difference between a waiver and a failure to assert? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Yes, exactly. Here -- the 

fact pattern here is he did not say "I am unwilling to 

waive, I do not wish this interview to go forward." He 

doesn't do that. He just doesn't assert --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You want to change the 

Miranda rule to say: Tell someone their rights, and 

unless they explicitly say "I don't want to talk to 

you," then they implicitly under virtually any 

circumstance haven't. That's what you believe the rule 

in Miranda and Butler and Davis sets forth? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Butler states that where 

there was silence after the provision of the Miranda 

warnings, silence, that where the subsequent conduct, 

where knowing reception of rights and the course of 

conduct indicates waiver --

MR. RESTUCCIA: I understand that's the facts 

of Butler. But the standards by which all the courts 

are operating, including the Michigan court, are the 

standards articulated by Butler. Butler says that the 

waiver can be inferred from the words and actions of the 

person interrogated, indicating that the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: My -- but we go back to the 

point you made earlier. Your position is the moment 

that someone confesses, that's an implicit waiver. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: No, because there could have 

been actions taken by the police during the course of 

this interview. There were no threats. There were no 

improper promises. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand how this 

person could just sit there for 2 hours and didn't want 

to be interrogated and doesn't say: You know, I don't 

want to answer your questions. He just sits there, and 

some questions he doesn't answer. And he does make a 

few comments, anyway.

interrogated, all you have to say is "I don't want to 

answer your questions"? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Mr. Thompkins --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's nice and clear, 

wouldn't be any problem at all. That was never said 

here. He, in fact, submitted to having these questions 

asked of him. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: I think that that kind of 

cuts to the nub of what Miranda says. Miranda says that 

ultimately the statement has to be the free election of 

the suspect. And here when Mr. Thompkins answered the 

series of questions, he knew that he didn't have to 

answer those questions, and nothing the police had done 

during the course of the interview had undermined the 

provision of rights, because it's those two aspects 

which are the core, the knowing and intelligent and when 

it's voluntary. Nothing the police had done had 

undermined --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why should the police have 

to play this game of, you know, an hour and a half, 

2 hours, 2 hours and 15 minutes, 5 hours, 7 hours? 

Why don't we have just a clear rule: You’re read your 

rights; if you don't want to be questioned all you have 

to say is: I don't want to be questioned.

Mr. Thompkins at any point could have said: I want 

to stop" --

JUSTICE BREYER: What would you do with 

Miranda's statement "But a valid waiver will not be 

presumed simply from the silence of the accused" -- I 

grant you, as modified in Butler to say that the State 

has a heavy burden of showing that the silence followed 

by a confession -- the State has a heavy burden of 

showing that that is an affirmative waiver. Now, those 

I think are the two statements of law, the third being 

that after, if there is no waiver, the police cannot 

continue to question. Now, I thought that was the clear 

law. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: It’s a --

JUSTICE BREYER: I grant you, you might argue 

for a change in the law. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: But -- but this language from 

Miranda that says the silence of the accused after 

warnings are given would not be sufficient, that's 

right, but Butler then fully explained. And think about 

the State courts are coming in that they then -- this 

Court then made clear that even silence after having 

received Miranda warnings -- that if you knowingly 

receive your rights and there is a course of conduct 

that indicates waiver, that there can be a waiver.

That's exactly what the Federal courts have done on 

direct review. 

Now, thinking about the Michigan courts and 

trying to determine what’s -- how these rules are to be 

applied, the Federal courts have found, in the absence of a 

waiver, where a suspect knowingly receives his rights 

and then answers questions implicating himself, that the 

answers themselves can serve as the basis for the 

finding of a waiver. 

That's what the -- the conclusion that Mr. 

Thompkins waived here is a reasonable one. It’s not 

objectively unreasonable. And, of course, you have to 

recall the overarching habeas law that governs this, 

that not just does a Michigan court decision have to 

be incorrect, it has to be objectively unreasonable. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there any difference 

between -- between waiving your right and a failure to 

assert your right? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Yes, there is a difference, 

that here Mr. Thompkins did not assert his right. He 

did not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is every failure to assert

inconsistent with the exercise of his rights. When he

MR. RESTUCCIA: Before -- in that --

MS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Respondent's confession was properly 

admitted at his trial. I’d like to go right to some 

of the questions that this Court had about the language 

that was used in the Miranda decision and in the Butler 

decision. Both -- all of this language comes up in 

Butler. Now, Butler was a case not about the waiver of 

the right to silence, but a waiver of the right to 

counsel. So the suspect said "I will talk to you," but 

the North Carolina Supreme Court said: Well, we don't 

know if he waived his right to counsel, and that's why 

the court got into a question of implied waiver. 

So the Court in its analysis in Butler first 

reviewed this language that the Court has talked about 

this morning from Miranda that says "A valid waiver will 

not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused 

or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact 

eventually obtained." 

And this is our understanding of that language: 

First, it is not the case that a failure to invoke Miranda 

rights will be taken in the Miranda context as a waiver. 

Now, Justice Scalia, I think you 

alluded to the fact that the normal rule for the Fifth 

Amendment at trial is that you assert your rights or

they are waived. But Miranda's an exception to that, 

that the failure to assert we are not going to take as a 

waiver. The government has to do something more. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So do you read -- yes. So 

do you read Miranda as saying that there cannot be 

questioning unless there is a waiver? Then we'll go 

on to -- or do you --

MS. SAHARSKY: No. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Okay, you do not. 

MS. SAHARSKY: No. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So are you going to go on --

because this is right where you are. Are you going to go on 

to say that, in the Miranda context, the failure to assert 

can -- can suffice to allow the questioning to proceed? 

MS. SAHARSKY: As long as the warnings are 

given, the accused has been told of his rights, and that 

the police will respect his rights, and questioning can 

proceed. The Court said in Davis and said in other 

cases, Moran versus Burbine, that the primary protection 

afforded by Miranda is to level the playing field by 

letting the accused know of his rights and that the 

police will respect them. And after the point that he 

gets his rights and understands them, the police can 

question him. You'd have to overrule Butler to say that 

there has to be a waiver before any questioning.

Just to get back to the second thing that 

the Court said in Miranda that was picked up in Butler, 

it said: We are not going to assume that there is a 

waiver simply from the fact that a confession was 

eventually obtained; there is a burden on the 

government. 

And the way that we understand that is that 

the government can't just go into court and say: Look, 

we have a confession; we know he waived his rights. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But why isn't that 

language that you quote a negative inference that there 

must be a waiver? 

MS. SAHARSKY: Well, if you look back at the 

language -- the other language in Miranda, it says that a 

waiver is a prerequisite to the admission of the 

evidence at trial. We know that to be able to use that 

evidence we have to know that he made a knowing and 

intelligent and voluntary decision to talk. But that 

he -- that doesn't mean he has to make the decision to 

talk right away. He might want to listen to what the 

police have to say about the benefits of cooperation or 

the evidence that they have in his case. And that --

those are the kinds of things the police could say that 

could be understood to be custodial interrogation. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So there’s a difference

between waiving at the time of the interrogation and 

then waiving it at the time of trial? I don't 

understand that. 

MS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to 

suggest that. What I'm saying is at the time the 

Respondent makes his statements, that waiver -- there has 

to be a waiver and it has to be a knowing, intelligent, 

and voluntary one. That at the time he makes his 

statement -- here when he admitted that he shot the boy 

down, he had to understand what his rights were and 

there had -- those statements had to not be the result 

of police coercion. 

And no court here has found that they were the 

result of police coercion. There is no question about 

voluntariness here. 

So what we understand this language in 

Butler to mean about an implied waiver is the fact of a 

confession itself is not enough to show the government 

has met its burden. When the Court talked about a 

course of conduct, it talked about the same standard 

that it's always used in the Miranda context, that came 

up again recently in this Court's decision in Shatzer, 

which is that the ultimate question is a knowing, 

intelligent, and voluntary waiver. 

The course of conduct doesn't mean anything

more than that. It means that at the time the guy 

spoke --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But in this case, it was 

the fact of the concession -- the confession that 

constituted the waiver. 

MS. SAHARSKY: That shows that he decided to 

talk, but the confession itself isn't enough. We needed 

to have -- the State needed to have evidence that he 

understood his rights, which he said he did, and that there 

was -- that the confession was not the product of police 

coercion. 

And I think that that comes through directly 

in the language that's at issue in Butler. The Court 

said “an express written or oral statement of waiver” --

to remain silent or the right to counsel -- “is strong proof 

of the validity of the waiver but not inevitably necessary…. 

The question is not one of form, but whether the 

defendant, in fact, knowingly and voluntarily waived the 

rights delineated in Miranda.” 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I just want to make 

sure where we are. 

MS. SAHARSKY: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You’re not -- you’re conceding, 

it seems to me, that there must be a waiver?

exact a substantial price on law enforcement, and that's 

the exact argument that Justice Brennan made in the 

Butler case that was rejected. He was in dissent in 

that case. He said the police should always have to --

have to seek a waiver before they interrogate. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know why you 

didn't answer Justice Stevens's questions by saying, 

Justice Stevens, I don't care about waiver. There was 

no -- there was no assertion of the right. 

But you’re not saying that. You are 

admitting there has to be a waiver.

at trial, there has to be a waiver.

change the police's behavior? Inbau and Reid and, you 

know, the -- the NAC -- the Defense Lawyers’ brief here is 

filled with quotations from typical police manuals, and 

they all seem to say things like you have to have at --

once the waiver is given, the police may proceed with 

interrogation. That seems to be what police today are 

instructed across the country. 

It says you cannot question people until he 

indicates after the warning is given a willingness to 

answer questions. That's the police manual. 

So why do you say this would extract a price 

on law enforcement when the typical police manuals seem 

to say what the Petitioner here is saying? 

MS. SAHARSKY: Not every police --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean the Respondent. 

MS. SAHARSKY: -- manual says that. That 

brief itself cites many examples going both ways. 

It is often the case, and it is often the 

case in Federal law enforcement, that the police try to 

seek a waiver immediately after giving rights because we 

want to avoid the problems of proof that come up at 

trial if we don't have a written waiver. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Which -- which are the 

police manuals that go your way? Because I want to look 

at those, too.

MS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry, I don't -- I don't 

have the specific citations from the brief. I -- I know 

from asking the Federal law enforcement agencies -- DHS, 

the FBI, and the DEA -- that the DEA does not invariably 

seek a waiver and that we don't understand that we need 

to get an immediate waiver. 

And, again, that was what Justice Brennan 

said in -- in dissent in Butler, is that the police should have 

to seek an immediate waiver. And the Court said, no, 

the Fifth Amendment right is -- compel -- about compelled 

statements being introduced at trial. We don't need 

this protection, that the police have to seek an immediate 

waiver. In fact, if you adopted a rule like that, it 

would essentially take any burden off the suspect to 

invoke his rights. 

He wouldn't need to invoke his rights, 

because the police would just -- if the police didn't 

seek a waiver. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you’re saying 

there -- there’s a difference, I -- I assume, between 

not waiving and positively asserting your right not to 

be interrogated? 

MS. SAHARSKY: That's exactly right. If the

MS. SAHARSKY: That's right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which would have -- which 

would been the -- the waiver. And -- and you’re saying 

it's his later behavior that -- that showed that, in 

fact, he waived. What if instead of just refusing to 

sign, he had said, I do not want to be interrogated? 

MS. SAHARSKY: Then the interrogation stops. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

MS. SAHARSKY: And that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So -- so he has the right 

to terminate the whole thing by asserting his right. If 

he neither asserts the right nor grants the waiver, the 

police can continue to try to obtain a statement from 

him? 

MS. SAHARSKY: Right. A contrary rule would 

have to overrule Butler, because the Court said you can 

clearly infer waiver from the actions and words of the 

person interrogated. That assumes that the person is 

being interrogated. Just to talk a minute about the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there also assumes 

there has to be a waiver.

at be introduced at trial, it must be the case that he 

decided he was going to talk to the police knowingly, 

intelligently, and voluntarily. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Excuse me. As I read 

this transcript, the police's tactic, by their own 

statement, was to approach him and say: This is our 

evidence. Explain yourself -- that's the words 

the officer used -- but he's entitled to an alternative 

explanation. Tell us. 

What's clear is that at no point did he 

answer those questions, because nothing about the nods 

of the head or anything else showed a willingness to 

confess. 

And even in the responses he gave, he 

answered a series of questions with a “yes,” but not with 

an explanation, which was what was being requested. 

So my question is, how does one infer a 

voluntary statement from a situation in which someone's 

really not talking? I've never understood how a yes or 

a nod to questions that don't -- that's what the circuit 

said, to questions that we don't know what they were 

about -- do you want a mint or not, I don't even know 

that -- can reflect voluntariness? 

And I understand that in Butler when someone 

says I don't want to sign that, but I'm going to spill

my guts now, and does, that's a course of conduct one 

could view as voluntary. 

MS. SAHARSKY: Right. And we say that the 

waiver occurred at the time he answered the questions 

about his belief in God. And it doesn't matter what he 

said in response to the earlier questions, as long as at the 

time that he answered questions about God, his decision 

to talk was a knowing and intelligent and voluntary one. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Unless, I assume, that 

you -- you -- you acknowledge that if the interrogation 

had go on -- had gone on for so long that it had become 

coercive, then that -- that -- that last statement would 

not -- would not be a voluntary waiver. 

MS. SAHARSKY: That's right. But Respondent 

made a voluntariness argument throughout all of the 

courts in this case, and every court has rejected it.

of rights and a waiver before you question. And I just 

want to direct the Court to page 475 of Miranda: 

Requirement of warnings and waiver is a fundamental 

aspect of the Fifth Amendment privilege and not simply a 

preliminary ritual to existing interrogation methods. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What happens when 

you read Butler? 

MS. JACOBS: Butler, I think, is an 

interesting case, because Butler is mostly aimed at the 

right to counsel. When you talk about the right to 

counsel and the right to remain silent, you have really 

two different kinds of rights. And there’s an 

assertion requirement in the right to counsel. You 

can't exercise that right without getting some help from 

the police. 

But the right to remain silent -- we don't 

require that it be asserted. It is a presumption. And 

that presumption remains. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Your argument is that you 

can infer waiver of the right to counsel from conduct, 

but you can't infer waiver of the right to remain silent 

from conduct? 

MS. JACOBS: Essentially, yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your best authority 

for that proposition?

You can -- I do -- you can take an implied 

waiver of the -- of the right to silence. I -- I do 

agree with that. And I look at the cases that have been 

cited, and I know that there are three kinds of examples. 

One is the person walks into the police 

Station, and he says I want to confess. That's a 

voluntary confession. You don't have to assert 

anything. He's -- he's going to confess. 

If you have a steady stream of speech in 

which he says, I don't want to talk but I'll tell you 

about this, again, you have somebody acting voluntarily. 

Someone who says I'll only talk about drugs 

but I'm not going to talk about murder -- he’s implied 

he’s waived his right to that. 

But in this case, when you look at this 

case, the key issue really is was it volitional? What 

fact would lead a court to decide that there -- that my 

client --

JUSTICE ALITO: So, basically what you’re 

saying is that if the defendant here had said at the 

beginning, I don't know whether I -- I want to talk 

to you or not, but I'm going to listen to your questions 

and I might answer some and I might answer others -- that

would be a different case? 

MS. JACOBS: Yes, absolutely. You have an 

implied waiver. 

JUSTICE ALITO: And where is there -- what 

Supreme Court case establishes the distinction between 

those two situations clearly? 

MS. JACOBS: Well, Davis is a case that 

talks about the assertion of the right to counsel, but 

does not apply to the right to remain silent. So I 

think as long as you still have the presumption of --

the presumption of the privilege against 

self-incrimination as a presumptive right, the police 

have to do something to move you off square one in order 

to make it voluntary. 

Am I answering your question, Justice Alito? 

JUSTICE ALITO: I'm not sure I really 

understand. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It depends on what you --

what you need to make "it," it depends on what "it" is. 

If -- if you mean the ultimate confession, I think I 

don't agree. Ultimately, if he confesses and hasn't 

been coerced, it's voluntary. 

But if by the "it" you mean to make the 

continuation of the interrogation voluntary, that's a 

different question. And I don't know that our cases

establish that you cannot continue the interrogation

MS. JACOBS: Well, Justice Scalia, I just 

read you page 475 from Miranda that says the requirement 

is warnings and waiver, and that's not, as they said, a 

preliminary ritual. That means more. Seibert -- and I 

know it's a preliminary -- a plurality --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But does that make it clear 

that -- that there has to be a waiver before the 

interrogation can continue? And if it does, how does it 

square with Butler? 

MS. JACOBS: Again, Butler is really a right 

to counsel case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: They’re both under --

they’re both under Miranda. Both of those rights are 

Miranda rights. 

MS. JACOBS: In Butler the -- the waiver, 

the voluntary act of the person being interrogated 

really occurred very, very early. There wasn't any kind 

of a gap. He said, I don't -- I believe he said, I 

don't want to -- I don't want to do something in 

writing, but I'll talk to you. 

Now, that is a voluntary act: I'm going to 

talk to you. That is clearly a waiver. That isn't

you have a lengthy questioning, then the fact that he 

then gives a statement cannot be taken as a -- cannot be 

admitted. That's -- that's what it seems to say on page

MS. JACOBS: You’ve got a waiver. 

JUSTICE ALITO: -- I'm not waiving? 

MS. JACOBS: But he's willing to talk to the 

police. In my case, Mr. Thompkins was unwilling. He 

could -- he would not look at anybody. He would not 

answer questions. We don't know what the "I don't know" 

and the "yeah" was to. So that's a very -- my case is a 

very different case than what you are proposing. There 

is no willingness to engage with the police; there is, in 

fact, this feeling that there is coercion going on. The 

longer that interrogation --

JUSTICE ALITO: Can I interrupt? Before I

can understand your case, I would like to understand 

this hypothetical. If the person says: I'm not waiving, 

but I'm not telling you that I won't waive at some point 

in the future. I’ll listen to your questions. 

MS. JACOBS: I think he is engaging in a 

conversation. 

JUSTICE ALITO: That's a waiver. 

MS. JACOBS: I think he's engaging in a 

conversation with the police and that the police at that 

point can continue to talk. But that isn’t what 

happened in this case. There was no indication by my 

client that he wanted to listen, that he wanted to talk. 

The longer that interrogation lasted, the more --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he -- he didn't say 

anything. You -- I think you could say that his conduct 

implied the very kind of statement that Justice Alito 

suggested in his hypothetical: I'll listen to you guys 

for a while. 

MS. JACOBS: What is key, I think, in your 

-- in your hypothetical and in Justice Alito's 

hypothetical, is that you have a defendant that feels 

comfortable, that is not being oppressed by this 

coercive atmosphere. My client did not engage in 

anything, and the longer he sat there, the greater the 

chances that anything he said was the product of

coercion. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I -- just refresh my 

recollection. In the record in this case, do we know 

whether he said he understood his rights? 

MS. JACOBS: Justice Stevens, that's kind of 

iffy. The police officer --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Because that was present 

in Butler. 

MS. JACOBS: Yes, the police officer in this 

case said either “I don't remember whether I asked him” or 

“I think he nodded that he understood.” I don't think 

we've got a real solid proof of that. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It was read to him. 

MS. JACOBS: Yes, it was read to him. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And they had him read a 

portion of the Miranda warning. 

MS. JACOBS: I don't think they had him read 

a portion --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Huh? 

MS. JACOBS: -- Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I thought, in order to test 

his knowledge of English, they asked him to read one or two 

paragraphs. 

MS. JACOBS: Okay.

Justice Scalia, you're correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So I -- boy, I -- what more 

do you need? 

MS. JACOBS: You need --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, he -- he’s 

listening when -- when they read it to him. He -- he --

he can read it himself. 

MS. JACOBS: You are presuming that a 

defendant thinks that they've got the kind of power to 

look at a police officer and say, "I don't want to talk 

to you. Remove me." 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe -- maybe he doesn't 

want to talk for the moment, but he does want to listen. 

I'm not sure you’re doing defendants a great -- a great 

favor. I mean, some of them might want to listen to --

to the police telling them, you know, by the way, your 

co-conspirator is singing like a bird and he's trying to 

pin it all on you, and maybe, you know, if -- if you 

don't want to get left holding the bag, maybe you’d better 

to talk to us and tell us what really happened.

even if I didn't want to talk right now, I might still 

want to listen, which is apparently what this -- what 

this person did. He could have said, I don't want to --

I don't want talk. 

And it -- and it would have ended. That 

would have been an assertion of his right. He didn't 

assert his right, but --

MS. JACOBS: What --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- he -- he sat there and 

listened. Now, maybe he wanted to find out what the 

police would have to say to him. 

MS. JACOBS: There is nothing in -- on this 

record that indicates that he wanted to listen to them 

as opposed to what Justice Alito's hypothetical is, 

where the gentleman says: Well, I'm not going to say 

anything, but I want to hear what you have to say. We 

don't have that here. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, we have it to 

the extent that he was told he had right to remain 

silent and he didn't say, I'm not going to talk to you. 

MS. JACOBS: There’s no clearly established 

law that says that he has to assert his right to remain 

silent.

clearly established law the other way, which is the

pertinent question? 

MS. JACOBS: I think that because there is 

the presumption of the -- the privilege is a presumptive 

right, that he does not have to assert it. This is --

this is -- the right, or the privilege against 

self-incrimination, the constitutional command, is the 

one right that really defines our criminal justice 

system. It means that you cannot talk to -- the police 

do not have the right to talk to the defendant. It 

makes us an accusatorial system --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We’re not talking 

-- we’re not talking about the Fifth Amendment right. 

We’re talking about the Miranda warnings. There’s no 

issue of voluntariness in this case. Right? 

MS. JACOBS: Well, when --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: There’s no 

suggestion that there’s -- that the statements are not 

voluntary. The suggestion is that they may have 

violated Miranda. 

MS. JACOBS: Right. That's correct. But if 

you are going to adopt the suggestion of the government 

that you do pre-interrogation waiver, which I think is 

what we’re talking about -- that is, you don't give him 

his rights and then you can just talk and talk 

until you are blue in the face, that that ends up being

a more coercive situation than we have now. 

This is the kind of situation that could 

have been easily resolved just by the officer asking Mr. 

Thompkins, do you want to talk to us? Instead, once 

they establish --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if he said, do 

you want to remain silent? 

MS. JACOBS: He could -- that's fine. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And he doesn't 

answer either one. 

MS. JACOBS: Then -- then he’s not 

cooperating. He’s not waiving his rights. It's not 

voluntary. Take him back to the cell, that's it. 

Because the police --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you’re saying then 

that the defendant has to -- never has to invoke his 

right? That --

MS. JACOBS: The state of the -- the state 

of the law is a defendant does not have to invoke his 

right to remain silent. Davis is the invocation case; 

it applies to the second stage of -- of the 

interrogation. And it has to do with --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was the Miranda warning 

adequate in this case? He got the four warnings, but

defendant, do you waive your rights, this form never 

asked, did you waive your rights? It just said: Do you 

acknowledge that we have informed you of your rights? 

MS. JACOBS: That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. That's all that form said. And what the 

officer said is once Mr. Thompkins would not sign it, he 

then moved into interview mode. There was no 

further -- if this was an ambiguous act to him, then the 

officer should have asked a clarifying question. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say you don't 

have to invoke your rights, but Butler also says that 

you can impliedly waive them. You don't have to 

expressly waive them. 

MS. JACOBS: I'm saying you don't have to 

invoke the right to remain silent, that that’s not the 

state of the law, that only the right to remain -- I'm 

sorry -- the right to counsel must be invoked. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. So the 

question under AEDPA -- you agree there can be an implied 

waiver; that's what Butler says, right? So the question 

under AEDPA is whether the State court was unreasonable 

to determine that there was an implied waiver on these 

facts?

unreasonable determination of the facts in this case? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. 

MS. JACOBS: And I think that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Maybe. 

MS. JACOBS: It's one way or the other. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right. 

MS. JACOBS: And I think clearly that there 

-- that there were facts that the Michigan Court of 

Appeals found that were not supported by the record and 

were objectively unreasonable. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What are those? 

MS. JACOBS: The Sixth Circuit found that 

when the Michigan Court of Appeals said the defendant 

continued to talk with officers, the Sixth Circuit said 

that that was an objectively unreasonable finding 

because there was no continuation, there was no talking. 

They also found unreasonable that the defendant talked 

with officers sporadically. The Sixth Circuit said that 

that was a misrepresentation of the record. 

The last fact that they talked about is the 

Michigan Court of Appeals said that the defendant made 

eye contact several times or a number of times. And the 

Sixth Circuit said, quote -- this is what the -- they 

said that that was incorrect. What the officer said at 

the hearing is that eye contact came only at the end,

one of the very -- one of the very first times came only 

at the end. 

So -- but those are important facts. The 

fact that he was not continuing to talk -- he wasn't 

talking at all. How do you find this -- this 

voluntariness, that the rights are waived --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, those facts are 

relevant only if we accept your -- your principal assertion, 

which is that you -- you don't have to invoke the right and 

interrogation must cease immediately. If we agree with 

that, then all of these facts become relevant. But if 

we think that, until you invoke the right, the police can 

continue to ask you questions and it's up to you to 

answer or not, then those facts are really not relevant 

at all, are they? 

I think that's true. 

MS. JACOBS: I don't want to say it's true 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It wasn't meant to be a 

trick question. 

MS. JACOBS: -- just because you are asking 

it. 

If you invoke those -- if you invoke -- if 

you hold that he has to invoke those rights.

those factual things are irrelevant, whether --

MS. JACOBS: Well, my theory is that you 

don't get past the failure to get the waiver. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly, exactly. 

MS. JACOBS: Yes. 

Returning now to -- to the idea of the 

pre-interrogation waiver, I would suggest to the Court 

that that would return this -- this Court back to the 

kind of test that Miranda stopped, which was the 

applying the totality of the circumstances test, and 

that you would then, again, revert to pre-Miranda law, 

where -- and this I believe is what the Wayne County 

prosecutor amicus wants to do, is just apply totality of 

the -- the circumstances test to whether in fact someone 

has waived their rights. And I would suggest to you that 

Miranda has not been a failure, that this bright-line rule --

you give the rights, you get the waiver, then can you talk --

that that’s --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I must say I've never 

understood that to be the law, and I don't think it's 

generally understood to be the law, that unless you get 

a waiver right at the outset, you have to -- you have to 

terminate interrogation. I think there are a lot of 

police departments that don't -- I've never understood 

that to be the rule.

that then becomes the ability to keep the defendant in a 

room, and the longer --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not saying it isn't a 

good rule. It may be a good rule. But the issue here 

is whether it is so clearly established that it was 

unreasonable for the State court to think otherwise. 

MS. JACOBS: And we would just suggest that 

the State court applied Moseley incorrectly and applied 

Miranda, that those are the clearly established law 

in that case. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I like clear rules. Your 

rule is a clear one. Another clear one would be just 

the opposite of yours; that is, that interrogation can 

continue unless he asserts his right. That's another 

clear rule. We can go either way, and it will be clear. 

MS. JACOBS: But if interrogation continues, 

the longer it continues the less likely that the 

statement that is taken is going to be the product of my 

client's free will. So the government is going to have 

an even greater burden in trying to prove that this 

statement was voluntary or that the waiver of rights is 

voluntary. 

So this Court should not adopt a 

pre-interrogation waiver rule, especially not one

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me when 

the police have to stop? They read somebody their 

rights; the person says nothing. Are you saying at that 

point they have to stop? 

MS. JACOBS: I think that they can say to 

the person: Do you now want to waive your right and 

talk to us or do you want to remain silent? I think 

that that's an easy and expedient answer. If --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But he doesn't answer. He 

just sits there --

MS. JACOBS: Then that's it.

then the burden isn't met, this heavy burden that he 

has knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived 

those rights.

square that with Moseley. 

MS. JACOBS: Well, Moseley says that the 

longer that you question someone, that -- Moseley is the 

persistent questioning case, where you keep questioning

the guy and questioning the guy. And this is very 

clearly a Moseley case. You’ve got two officers in that 

room, and they talk about the fact that they are both 

questioning and they talk about the different themes 

they used. And the very fact that they had to change 

themes showed that the defendant was not being 

cooperative and not -- and was not engaging in this 

conversation willingly. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And all he has to 

do is say: I don't want to talk to you. It's over. 

MS. JACOBS: And all they had to say -- I've 

got to take the flip side -- is -- and because it's their 

house, because if they don't want to create the 

ambiguity, they are the ones that have to say: Will 

you talk to us now? 

They don't even have to ask him to sign the 

waiver, although I think the waiver is proof positive. 

Once he signs the waiver, you know, I haven't got much 

to argue in terms of the admissibility of the 

confession. But if they create the ambiguity, then 

according to Miranda, that ambiguity is resolved against 

them. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I don't understand 

how they create the ambiguity.

they're not moving off of square one. They're leaving 

this, where they are not looking for an answer to 

whether the rights want to be waived and they are 

immediately, as they did in this case, going into 

interview mode. They are going to start to question 

him. 

And this gets to Moseley, where, in fact, you 

end up where you are badgering somebody, and in this case, 

they used many different tactics: the softening technique --

- here, have a mint. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess this 

gets back to a question I had earlier. I thought 

there was no dispute on this record that there was no 

involuntariness. We are talking about a violation of 

the technical, important but formal, Miranda 

requirements. This is not a case where the person says: 

My statements were involuntary. 

MS. JACOBS: If you are going to base this 

on an implied waiver, don't you have to look to see what 

the circumstances were that were going on? How can you 

look at the very end of a 2-hour and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that's correct --

and that's where -- how I read Butler; you have to look at 

the circumstances. And you’re saying no, you don't look at 

any circumstances; they have got to ask the question and

he has to waive.

circumstances are irrelevant. 

Well then, if yes, why are you talking to me 

about 2 hours 15 minutes, what they are doing? You say 

that circumstances don't matter. 

MS. JACOBS: If you find that the officer 

does not have to ask the question, does not have to 

clarify whether in fact the defendant is remaining 

silent, then I do have to talk to the rest to try and 

persuade you that in those 2 hours and 45 minutes he was 

not being cooperative, he was not willingly entering 

into --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That issue is not in 

this case, though. 

MS. JACOBS: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: As I understand it, 

you've lost at every stage on the voluntariness and have 

not renewed that, correct? This is a Miranda case; it's 

not a Fifth Amendment case. 

MS. JACOBS: I did -- I did talk about 

voluntariness in my brief to this Court.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: One? I mean, 

that's -- I don't want to piggyback off 

Justice Kennedy's point, but that's the whole point, is 

you do not look at any of those circumstances, you say. 

Before they can say anything more, they have to get a 

waiver. So it's 30 seconds if they go on, before 

they -- if they sit there for how long before -- how 

long do they have to ask, do you want to waive? 

MS. JACOBS: If -- if you were going to go 

and use implied waiver, if -- and I think that you can use 

an implied waiver, you -- you are interested in looking at 

what happened in this case to decide whether, in fact, 

the “yes” answers were an implied waiver. And that's why 

I'm arguing about the circumstances, that there's 

nothing in these circumstances that could lead you to 

believe that after 2 hours and 45 minutes, there was a 

voluntary waiver, the implied waiver.

I'm willing to listen to you. It seems to me you’re 

confusing a -- a waiver of -- of the right to remain 

silent with a waiver of the right not to be 

interrogated, which is the right that you are asserting 

here, a right not to be interrogated, unless going 

in you say, I waive my right to remain silent. That's --

that's the new right that you are asserting. 

MS. JACOBS: Well, it's not a new right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: A right not to be 

interrogated. 

MS. JACOBS: It's -- it's not a new right. 

It's not a new right. The police cannot interrogate the 

defendant unless they read him his rights and my 

understanding of Miranda is that they obtain a waiver of 

those rights. 

Without obtaining the waiver, questioning 

cannot ensue, because then the rest of the questioning 

becomes trying to talk the defendant into waiving the 

rights, trying to talk the defendant into confessing, 

and you have badgering and you have persistent 

questioning, and you don't end up with a volitional 

waiver or a volitional statement. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So what --

what is an implied waiver case? 

MS. JACOBS: Well, it's -- the implied

waiver case is North Carolina v. Butler. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's right. 

Now, getting back to Ms. Saharsky's point, she said if you 

prevail, you have to overrule Butler. And it seems to 

me that that's the point we're at. 

MS. JACOBS: But Butler -- I don't think you 

have to overrule Butler, because Butler really was a 

right to counsel case. It did talk about the right to 

remain silent, but most of language has to do with the 

fact that this gentleman did not waive the right to 

counsel. 

So, I don't think you have to. I think you 

can still have implied waivers. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, there's --

so, there's no implied waiver with respect to the right 

to remain silent? 

MS. JACOBS: That's a hard question, and I 

don't have -- I don't have an easy answer or a hard 

answer for you. I -- I don't think that -- I don't 

think that you want to hog-tie the police. I agree with 

that. I think that the police should be able to talk to a 

defendant, but there's got -- but it's got to be 

voluntary, and that in order to do that, you really have 

to get a waiver. 

U.S. v. Cardwell I think is an implied

waiver where the defendant starts to talk to the officer 

there -- they’re in a police car, and the defendant 

starts to talk to the officer after an hour and a half 

of silence, although that, again, isn't a custodial 

situation, but the police found -- but the court found 

that that was, in fact, a waiver. 

So if there are no further questions, I’ll 

cede my time. Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Restuccia, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I have to say that --

page 475 and 476, particularly, of Miranda do talk in 

terms of a -- of a waiver. Did -- are there -- did the 

subsequent cases indicate an articulation of that view 

that’s closer to your position? 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF B. ERIC RESTUCCIA 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, I think Miranda itself 

contemplates pre-waiver interrogation. If you look at 

page 14 of the -- of the reply brief, the yellow brief, 

and the quote from Miranda talking about the processes is, 

on page 14, "Once warnings have been given, the 

subsequent procedure is clear. If" -- it’s on page --

the middle. It’s a block quote from Miranda. This is 

Miranda's description of the processes: "Once warnings 

have been given, the subsequent procedure is clear. If 

the individual indicates in any manner at any time prior 

to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain 

silent, the interrogation must cease." The --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why doesn’t it --

JUSTICE BREYER: But I don't think that was the 

question. The question, at least as I understood it, is 

that Miranda says you cannot admit a confession into 

evidence unless he has first waived it. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: That's right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Then it says, clearly, that 

even if the police and the prosecution testify he did 

waive it, even if they say he did, explicitly, still, if 

there's a long questioning, even then, the court should 

be very careful about admitting it. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. But then --

JUSTICE BREYER: And doesn't it flow from 

that a fortiori that if he doesn’t admit it and all there 

is, is the long questioning that, there has been no 

waiver? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: But here Mr. Thompkins 

answered a series of questions knowing --

questions. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. One, do you 

believe in God? Yes. 

Two, do you pray to God? Yes. 

Three, have you asked God for forgiveness 

for shooting the boy? Yes. 

Okay. So, where -- where did he waive it? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: He -- that's what the 

Federal courts have done on direct review -- this is what 

Cardwell did, and there are five or six circuits have 

found the answers to the questions themselves can be the 

best --

JUSTICE BREYER: So, in this case, after 2 

hours and 15 minutes when he gave the answers I just 

said, when did he waive his Miranda rights? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: When he answered those 

questions, because the --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I think any then -- then 

Miranda is --

MR. RESTUCCIA: No, because --

JUSTICE BREYER: It says you can't admit the stuff 

after a long questioning unless he waives. Obviously, he says 

something or there would be nothing to admit.

Federal courts have done in applying Butler, because the 

words and actions of the person interrogated can give 

rise to the inference that the person has waived. Where 

the person has taken action that's inconsistent with the 

exercise of his rights, it is proper to find waiver. 

The -- this --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask, can you go back 

to page 14 in your reply brief? "Once warnings have 

been given, the subsequent procedure is clear. If the 

individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to 

or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, 

the interrogation must cease." 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: So the question is whether 

during those two hours by not answering a -- a number of 

questions, did he indicate in any way that he wished to 

remain silent? 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Right. That this -- so if 

you look at the implication analysis, did he make it clear 

that I don't want to participate in this interrogation? 

Detective Helgert's testimony --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Then it says that any -- in 

any manner that he wished to remain silent. And until 

the 2 hours and a half later when he did answer the 

three questions, that's pretty -- it's at least arguable

that his silence indicated he wished to remain silent. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Well, what happens, though, 

in Davis, this Court made clear for the purpose of 

invocation, that the invocation has to be unambiguous 

because the police have to know when they have to cut 

off their questioning. The -- so, if it's ambiguous, 

it's ultimately, for the question of invocation, his 

burden to assert the right to take an affirmative action 

to show, I don't want to answer any questions. 

Detective Helgert believed, through his 

limited responses, the give and take of part of this 

interview, that he was a willing participant in the 

interview. This is the factual record that was 

established by the State courts. It's important to 

remember that this case being reviewed in habeas that 

those factual determinations are entitled to deference 

unless disproven. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

MR. RESTUCCIA: Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The case is
