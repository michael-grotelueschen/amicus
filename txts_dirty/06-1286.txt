 (10:02 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in case 06-1286, Michael Knight, 

Trustee, v. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.

 Mr. Rubin.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. RUBIN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. RUBIN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The question in this case is the meaning of 

a statute that provides that, in arriving at a trust or 

estate's adjusted gross income, amounts are allowable in 

full if they are -- and I quote here from 26 U.S.C. 

section 67(e), which you can find at the bottom of page 

3a of the appendix to the blue brief -- "costs which are 

paid or incurred in connection with the administration 

of the estate or trust and which would not have been 

incurred if the property were not held in such trust or 

estate."

 I'd like to make three broad points.

 First, when one applies the judicial tools 

of statutory interpretation, the statute can mean only 

one thing. Second, "would not" does not mean "could 

not." The Commissioner's current reading of the statute

and the Commissioner's previous readings of the statute 

are wrong. Indeed, the logic of the Commissioner's 

position supports us. It acknowledges the distinctive 

nature of trusts and fiduciary obligations. Finally, 

our reading makes sense. It is consistent with the 

treatment of trusts and estates elsewhere in the Code. 

It puts in place an administrable rule that draws a 

clear line, and by contrast the Commissioner has 

provided no reason at all why Congress would have wanted 

to subject the fees at issue here to the 2 percent 

floor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think those three points 

are certainly what would help me. Could I ask just two 

preliminary questions? They don't necessarily have to 

do with this case, just to get something straight. I 

take it that you couldn't have claimed this deduction 

under 162 without getting into an argument that it 

should be capitalized and that's why 212 is in the Code?

 MR. RUBIN: Well, 212 and 162 are really 

sort of two sides of the same coin. 162 is for costs 

incurred in a trade or business, and there's no -- the 

trust isn't engaged in a trade or business any more than 

an individual who invests for the protection of property 

is in a trade or business. 212, by contrast -- and the 

text of 212 can be found in the governor's -- the

government's brief appendix at 5a -- 212 is about 

expenditures for the preservation of property and for 

income in that context. So that's why this is a 212, 

not a 162.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: My other question is 

background only. Perhaps I should ask the government. 

Are 162 expenses subject to the 2 percent ceiling?

 MR. RUBIN: My recollection is that 162 --

162 expenses are not subject to the -- they're not 

miscellaneous itemized deductions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you agree 

that as a taxpayer seeking an exception to a general 

rule, you have the burden of proof in this case?

 MR. RUBIN: No, Your Honor. We think that 

-- well, there are really two things built into your 

question, Mr. Chief Justice.

 First is the question of who bears the 

burden of proof in tax cases specifically, and as this 

court has made clear, this was litigated below on a 

slightly different theory. The government's theory has 

changed during the pendency of the litigation. And 

below they argued that this was a common expense for 

individuals; yet they introduced no evidence of that. 

And under the United States v. Janis, this Court's 

decision in that case, they can't -- the government is

required to come forward with something before assessing 

tax. But in terms of exceptions and rules, we can --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We can't take -- I 

guess it's not judicial notice, but we can't assume that 

individual investors with several million dollars of 

liquid assets might hire investment advisors?

 MR. RUBIN: They might hire investment 

advisors, Your Honor, but we don't think that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do they usually hire 

investment advisors?

 MR. RUBIN: I don't think it's clear that 

they usually hire investment advisors, but I think the 

important point here, in a way, is the premise of your 

question, which is that only certain trusts with certain 

assets, under a test that looked at what the 

Commissioner used to argue, which is commonality or 

customariness of a particular expense, only -- the 

Commissioner herself now argues that, that this test is 

unmanageable because there's difficulty in figuring out 

what the denominator of the fraction is. Do you mean 

all people? Is it common among everyone, among 

taxpayers, among taxpayers with certain assets? Would a 

$100,000 trust have to be treated differently than a 

million dollar trust? Then there's the question of what 

do you mean by "common." You suggested "usually" or

"sometimes," "might." That's not clear either. And 

then ultimately there would have to be a trial somewhere 

to determine whether costs like this are indeed common 

to whatever standard was articulated. And I think this 

is why --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess you'd 

concede, wouldn't you, that you're not entitled to all 

of the investment advice that you receive but perhaps 

only that that is related to the trust status? In other 

words, if your investment advisor charges you $50,000 

and, you know, 10,000 of it is unique to the trust, but 

40,000 is the same sort of advice he'd give an 

individual, you'd only be able to get the 10,000 outside 

of the 2 percent limit?

 MR. RUBIN: We think, Your Honor, that all 

trust investment fees are distinctive, that what renders 

them distinctive and renders them fully deductible under 

the statute is that they are incurred as a result of 

distinctive fiduciary obligations. We think the statute 

draws a line between costs like that, that are incurred 

as a result of distinctive fiduciary obligation, which 

would include all investment management or advice fees, 

and by contrast costs that inhere in ownership of a 

particular piece of property and that any owner of that 

property would have to pay.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't -- I don't 

really see that line. I mean, let's -- let's take, you 

know, fixing the roof on a house that's in the trust. 

Aren't there distinctive trustee obligations with 

respect to preservation of property, just as there are 

with respect to preservation of financial assets?

 MR. RUBIN: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think that's a very hard 

line to draw.

 MR. RUBIN: Yes, Your Honor. I think the 

line is -- is actually easier to draw than your question 

suggests. I think that fixing a roof on a house might 

be a cost that is close to the line. It may be that 

some -- for example, if there were an ordinance in the 

community that required upkeep of a house, we think that 

it would be subject to the 2 percent floor.

 The archetypal example of a cost that we 

think Congress intended and by this language we believe 

Congress rendered subject to the 2 percent floor are the 

costs of pass-through entities that might be owned by 

the trust or estate. So, for example, if there's an S 

corporation and its management incurs an expense, that's 

reported back -- because the S corporation has no 

independent existence, that's reported back to the 

owner, individual or trustee, and is reported as an

administrative expense. It would be subject to the 2 

percent floor from the individual who incurred it, and 

it would have been incurred, which is the language of 

the statute, whether or not --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm still --

MR. RUBIN: -- it was held in such trust or 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I'm still trying to get 

back to my original question. I -- I would like to know 

what you think is not an expense that's distinctive to 

-- to a trust, other than fixing the roof, because you 

haven't persuaded me on that.

 MR. RUBIN: The --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think fixing a roof is 

fixing a roof.

 MR. RUBIN: The cost of -- not distinctive 

costs would be the costs incurred by an S corporation 

owned by the trustee.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Anything else?

 MR. RUBIN: A condo fee, for example, that 

simply essentially runs with the property. Whoever owns 

this land is going to have to pay the condo fee. 

Required insurance on a vehicle.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't there a trustee 

obligation to pay all -- all expenses which if not paid

will -- would cause a depletion of the assets?

 MR. RUBIN: It's a question of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can't you say that that's a 

trustee response -- I mean, if the criterion is he paid 

this money only to discharge an obligation as a trustee, 

it seems to me all of his expenses are in that category, 

with the possible exception of the S corporations you're 

talking about.

 MR. RUBIN: Well, Your Honor, the costs are 

distinctive in the case of -- of those things that are 

caused by fiduciary obligation in the sense that we 

describe because that's how they are caused. These 

costs are incurred without regard to that fiduciary 

obligation. They're paid perhaps because of fiduciary 

obligation, but they are incurred through ownership of 

the property.

 And there is a hint in the text. If you 

look at the text, you'll note that costs that are paid 

or incurred are deductible. But this asks about whether 

they would have been incurred if the property were not 

held in such trust or estate.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rubin, you were not 

willing to agree with the Chief when he said: Well, 

maybe there are some investment expenses that are 

special because this is a trust. But there must be some

that any investor would incur. But you say it's got to 

be all one way.

 MR. RUBIN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. Trustees 

cannot under law, and do not, invest as individuals do. 

To begin with, they always have to keep their eye on 

current, future, contingent and remainder beneficiaries 

and treat them with equal fairness.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But they don't have 

to hire investment advisors. There is a standard that 

they may think they can meet on their own. They may --

you know, it may be an investment advisor that is the 

trustee. He doesn't have to hire somebody else.

 So it's not something that necessarily 

inheres in the nature of the trust.

 MR. RUBIN: Whenever a trustee hires an 

investment advisor, it is to fulfill this fiduciary 

obligation. It is true that there may be a trustee who 

is expert in this.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why -- if I could 

pause you on that, why is that the case? Let's say it's 

a -- the trustee understands perfectly his obligations 

under the law. Let's just say he is supposed to 

preserve capital and invest conservatively, but he wants 

advice on which is the best conservative investment.

 You know, is it railroads or is it

utilities? And that's the investment advice he seeks --

just that. He says: I know how I'm supposed to invest 

as a fiduciary, but there are options in there, and I 

just want advice on the options.

 MR. RUBIN: Yes, Your Honor. I think that 

that is actually quite a typical situation. The 

trustee, of course, knows his or her obligations. It's 

his or her inability to figure out how to fulfill them 

that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't that 

just like an individual investor? If you have an 

individual investor with $10 million in liquid assets, 

he or she might know what he wants to do, either capital 

appreciation or preservation, you know, whatever the 

option is, but just wants some advice on how best to go 

about that. That sounds exactly like the trustee in our 

hypothetical.

 MR. RUBIN: Well, Your Honor, there are 

unique obligations. Some of these are set out in 

Connecticut statutes. This is in our brief at page 7 of 

the blue brief. There are ten considerations that 

Connecticut law requires trustees to examine, including 

things unique to trusts: the nature of the trust, its 

duration. The need for liquidity or income versus 

capital, which is principal growth versus income, is a

uniquely trustlike concern.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No. No. No. You 

see, that's my difficulty with your position. It's not 

uniquely trust because you certainly have individuals 

who may want income rather than capital appreciation or, 

you know, preservation of capital. They may have 

exactly the same objectives as a trustee. It's not 

unique to the trust.

 MR. RUBIN: It -- I guess I have two answers 

to that, Your Honor. It may, by happenstance, be that 

out of the black box of investment advice an individual, 

by happenstance, gets the same advice as a trust 

somewhere; but it would be by happenstance. The 

decisional process leading to obtaining the advice, 

incurring the cost, is distinct for trust, and indeed 

the advice they receive is distinct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it seems to me that 

that just simply couldn't have been Congress's purpose 

in passing this statute because now you have a recipe 

for avoidance. In most States -- California has a rule 

that the trustee has to make prudent business 

investments. I assume a great number of businessmen 

outside the trust context think that they have their 

principal objective of making prudent business 

investments. But under your theory all expenses for

that objective would fall within this exclusion. I just 

don't think that's what the Congress could possibly have 

intended.

 MR. RUBIN: Well, Your Honor, to begin with, 

there is no risk here of tax avoidance through creation 

of a trust. These are non-grantor trusts. There are 

substantial costs involved in creating them, but, among 

other things, the top bracket of 35 percent --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, is that true just in 

your case?

 MR. RUBIN: No --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Universally, there is 

never a danger of tax avoidance? You want us to write 

the decision on the assumption that tax avoidance is 

never a problem in the creation of a trust?

 MR. RUBIN: Well, the Commissioner concedes 

at page 37 of her brief that there is no substantial 

problem of income- splitting through the use of 

non-grantor trusts; and, indeed, throughout --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that true? And I'm 

looking at testimony given by J. Roger Mintz in 1986 

when this measure was before Congress, and in that 

written testimony is the statement: "First, the 

treatment of trusts as separate taxpayers with a 

separate, graduated rate schedule can cause income to be

taxed at a rate lower than if the grantor had retained 

direct ownership of the trust assets or given the assets 

outright to the beneficiaries."

 So apparently the Treasury was telling the 

Congress that there is a problem.

 MR. RUBIN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg. That 

problem was solved in Section 1 of 26 U.S. Code -- and 

this is described at page 37 of our brief -- by a 

compression of the tax brackets. The 35 percent bracket 

kicks in for non-grantor trusts at $10,500. For an 

individual it kicks in at $349,000. As a consequence, 

there is no incentive to move money into a trust in 

order to avoid taxation at a -- at a lower rate.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I am not sure 

what you mean by "non-grantor trusts." What is a 

"non-grantor trust"?

 MR. RUBIN: A non-grantor trust is a real 

trust with economic substance. A grantor trust is a 

trust in which the grantor retains certain powers, for 

example it's revocable, or whatever; and it's treated as 

-- people set them up for estate- planning purposes, but 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Every trust has a grantor, 

I assume.

 MR. RUBIN: Yes, yes, yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA: So a "non-grantor trust" --

MR. RUBIN: But this is -- I guess this is a 

term of art.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- is a trust without any 

money.

 MR. RUBIN: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: A grantor trust would be 

one of those pass-throughs.

 MR. RUBIN: Yes. And, indeed, this, I think 

-- and part of the answer to Justice Kennedy's question: 

The problem of tax avoidance was dealt with in section 

67)(c), where entities like that were -- were said to be 

treated as pass-through entities with no independent 

existence. But trusts and estates were excepted 

specifically from that because of this absence of risk 

of income-splitting. And, indeed, we think that the --

the structure of the statute, not merely its text, but 

the structure of the statute, indicates that this is 

what Congress intended.

 It's not -- it's not written the way I would 

have written it, Your Honor. But none of the other 

readings are textually even supportable, and this --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask this sort of 

elementary question, and it may reveal my stupidity. 

But actually sometimes these costs are incurred by

individuals, and sometimes they're not. But -- so that 

you would normally think there's going to be a 

case-by-case analysis of what happened in the particular 

case.

 But do I understand correctly that both you 

and the government take the position that we should 

apply the same rule across the board regardless of the 

actual facts?

 MR. RUBIN: I wouldn't say "regardless of 

the actual facts," Your Honor. But I would say this: 

We believe it's a categorical test.

 The first of what the Commissioner calls her 

textually plausible readings is literally a case-by-case 

examination of what would have happened with this 

property if it were held by whomever, the beneficiary, 

the grantor, it's not clear whom. And, as they 

described, Congress can't have meant that. And this 

would be an imponderable. How would you ever --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's the most normal 

reading of the language, it's a case-by-case test. It 

seems to me the -- probably the most unwise reading, 

also.

 MR. RUBIN: Well, Your Honor, I think -- I 

see your point. And I think this is why, if you look at 

the structure of Section 67, which treats pass-through

entities but not trusts and estates as presenting a risk 

of income-splitting; if you look at the Code more 

broadly, which permits deductions by trusts and estates 

in many circumstances -- section 68 does; section 154 

does -- when they're not permitted by individuals and 

especially when you look at the statutory history 

here --

Both houses of Congress -- well, this was 

preexisting law, I should begin by saying. And then 

both houses of Congress passed in the '86 Act this 

statute without the second clause.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I've read the legislative 

history, which shows to me, anyway, precisely no light 

whatsoever. It's -- the only relevant sentence, which 

is the third sentence, simply repeats the statute. And, 

therefore, I thought that what Congress is trying to do 

is say, treat trusts like individuals, except in respect 

to special expenses.

 What are special expenses? Those that 

are related to the trust and that an individual wouldn't 

have occurred -- incurred. I can't say it much clearly 

than that. But I have an absolutely clear idea what it 

means. To me it means that if this is an expense that 

the trust is saying is special, I would say, would a 

reasonable person who did not hold these assets in

trust, would such a person be likely to make that kind 

of expenditure?

 And if the answer to that question is yes, 

well, then I would say it's not a special expense. And 

if the answer is no, I would say it was.

 And then the IRS and you will come and say 

that isn't precise enough. And I'd say the IRS has 

plenty of authority in its regs to give lists of 

examples which they do in such instances.

 Now, I'm posing that, not because I bought 

into it, though I'm tempted to, but I'd like to know 

what your response is.

 MR. RUBIN: Well, Your Honor, I guess my 

response is severalfold. To begin with, the statute 

doesn't ask what usually happens on the outside or 

commonly or customarily, and indeed the Commissioner has 

abandoned this reading of the statute precisely because 

it presents the kind of imponderables that I was 

discussing with the Chief Justice: What is usually 

done? Do trusts of different sizes have different 

rules? When a trust's assets come below a certain 

point, what about that? And most importantly, it's not 

in the text of the statute.

 Now, the Commissioner concedes the 

distinctive nature of trusts. And if you look at the

examples that she gives on page 23 of her brief of what 

it is that, that is deductible in full, it's the same as 

this: Fiduciary income tax preparation. Well, 

people -- many people get income tax preparation for 

individual income tax returns. The only difference is 

it's a Form 1040 or a Form 1041.

 Our case is much further from the line than 

that because the investment advice must be tailored to 

these, to these rules under Connecticut law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. Well, then 

let's take that. Let's suppose that the trustee goes to 

an investment advisor, doesn't tell him that he is a 

trustee, just says, I need to know, I can't decide, 

should I invest in Union Pacific or CSX? I'm going to 

invest in a railroad; which one do you like better? He 

doesn't tell him he's a trustee, gets some advice and 

gets a bill. Is that subject to the 2 percent floor, 

because presumably the advice has got nothing to do with 

fiduciary responsibilities?

 MR. RUBIN: If it has nothing to do with 

fiduciary responsibilities, Your Honor, we think it 

would be a breach of fiduciary obligation to get --

waste the trust money paying for the advice and to act 

upon it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, no. It's a

reasonable -- let's say a railroad stock is a reasonable 

investment for a trust. He just wants to know which one 

is the best one.

 MR. RUBIN: We think that this is intended 

as a categorical rule. And we think that asking that 

question is in furtherance of these unique obligations 

and the prudent investor standard, which is not -- this 

is a new standard that's developed in the United States 

over the next decade or so. It is not merely what a 

prudent man would do under the old Harvard College v. 

Amory common law test.

 Investments that individuals can and do 

invest in are not open to trustees who have a series of 

rules, some of which are counterintuitive, in fact, 

about what they can do. And these are listed at pages 7 

to 10 of our brief. But that -- what you're describing 

we think is investment advice and if it's properly 

obtained it is distinctive.

 I should say also in response --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How can it be 

distinctive if the advisor doesn't even know that the 

person's a trustee?

 MR. RUBIN: Well, the question is the 

decisional process of the trustee. When the trustee 

calls up anyone, the income tax preparer, and says I'd

like to hire you, he doesn't have to say at the moment 

of hiring it's for a trust.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, when it's 

filled out --

MR. RUBIN: He'll figure it out --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- he knows it's on 

Form 1041 rather than 1040.

 MR. RUBIN: He will eventually come to know 

that the form is different, Your Honor, yes. But I 

don't think the subjective knowledge of the person from 

whom one gets the advice is the question. The question, 

I think, is textually directed to the incurment of the 

cost.

 And I should say also in part of response to 

part of Justice Breyer's question, the statutory history 

isn't merely the legislative history. It's the fact 

that, despite having just the first prong in it when it 

was passed by both houses of Congress, there was a floor 

amendment in the Senate on the day that it passed the 

Senate that dealt with pass-throughs. The first part of 

67(c), and the changes made in the conference committee, 

again as the Commissioner acknowledges at page 37 of her 

brief, the changes made in conference, including the 

addition of this, were to deal precisely with how should 

we deal with pass-throughs and trusts, and trust

ownership of pass-throughs --

JUSTICE BREYER: There's nothing that I 

could find anywhere that talked about pass-throughs in 

respect to the special situation of trusts and estates. 

In the first sentence it speaks to it in respect to 

individuals. It all makes sense. And what they seem to 

be saying is just what I said initially. We do agree 

trusts do have a special claim, but only in respect to 

special trust expenses. And which are they? They're 

the ones an individual wouldn't have incurred.

 And I'll put a gloss on it, like we do in 

law. I say a reasonable individual. I say wouldn't 

reasonably have incurred. And then I leave it up to the 

IRS to say which are the expenses that an individual 

would likely incur and which ones he wouldn't likely 

incur.

 Now, that runs throughout tax law, doesn't 

it, that kind of list, what's a necessary expenditure, 

what isn't. I mean, they do that all the time, don't 

they?

 MR. RUBIN: Yes, Your Honor. Regulations, 

however, have to be both reasonable --

JUSTICE BREYER: Not buying into they're 

thing with "could." I mean, that isn't my problem.

what are the distinct trust costs, it would have to 

include, if it includes fiduciary, income tax 

preparation or, better yet, judicial accounting, 

individual duties in the case of guardianships and so 

on. This is of the same caliber and at the same level 

of generality we think would have to be covered.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But have they issued a 

regulation drawing up this list at this point?

 MR. RUBIN: There's only a proposed 

regulation, Your Honor. And we believe that because 

their readings are not textually supportable, are 

unadministratable and aren't what Congress intended, 

that after applying the ordinary tools of statutory 

construction, there is only one meaning that this text 

can have.

 I'd like to respond to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it not 

administerable? Whether you think it's a faithful 

rendition of the statute is one thing, but this is 

exactly what Justice Breyer was talking about. It says 

these are the things that are special to the trust, and 

then these are the things that are not. That's what the 

proposed reg does, right?

 MR. RUBIN: Yes, Your Honor. It is -- it's 

a little bit of a moving target but it does say that.

If those are nonexhaustive lists and the difficulty of 

allocating these costs of attributing them to one thing 

or another, putting in place systems that trustees that 

charge unitary fees, which is what corporate trustees 

do, is enormous. And some of this can be seen in the 

comments, the public comments to the regulation, some 

excerpts of which are included in the appendix to our 

reply brief.

 But this is not a simple test. And indeed, 

the Commissioner essentially concedes that, saying that 

she would need to have safe harbors or some other 

unprincipled line because of the difficulty.

 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Rubin.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Section 67(e) creates a narrow exception to 

the 2 percent floor for costs which would not have not 

have been incurred if the property were not held in 

trust.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It wasn't narrow in the

beginning, right?

 MR. MILLER: Well, that's correct, Your 

Honor. The second clause was added in a floor 

amendment. Initially Congress had drafted just the 

"which are paid" -- "which are incurred or paid in 

connection with the administration of the estate or 

trust." Then the second clause was added. And that 

clause demands that the costs would not have been 

incurred if the property were not held --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is somewhat of a 

mystery, the wording of that clause. And since it came 

in at the very last minute, isn't it appropriate to give 

it a limited reading, rather than, in your suggestion, 

that this provision that up until the very end read just 

administration, "costs paid or incurred in connection 

with the administration of the estate or trust," 

period? And then there was this add-on. Why should we 

give that an expansive meaning?

 MR. MILLER: I think, regardless of the 

timing, Your Honor, Congress chose to enact it and that 

choice has to be given effect. And I think when you 

look at the way that the section as a whole is set up, 

67(e), the first introductory clause creates the general 

principle that for purposes of this section the adjusted 

gross income of an estate shall be computed in the same

manner as in the case of an individual, except that, and 

then there is clause one.

 So in the context of this section, we have a 

general rule and then an exception. And that ought to 

be interpreted in light of the usual principle that 

exceptions, particularly ambiguous exceptions, should 

not be construed so as to swallow up the entirety of the 

rule, which is essentially what Petitioner's 

interpretation would do.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you think that the 

only instances where the expense would not have occurred 

are those instances where it could not have occurred? 

That doesn't strike me as self-evident.

 I mean, I understand why you do it, so that 

can you have a nice clear line, which I am all for. But 

the line given by your colleague is just as clear. I 

don't know why I should accept yours when -- I mean, 

"would" just does not mean "could." I mean, would have, 

could have, should have, it's -- they're different 

words.

 MR. MILLER: Well, they are -- they're 

certainly different words. We're not suggesting that 

they are synonyms. But we are suggesting that there are 

contexts in which the word "would" can carry the same 

meaning that is also expressed through the word "could."

JUSTICE SCALIA: Give me a context where --

where -- other than this statute, where in common 

parlance people use "would" to mean "could."

 MR. MILLER: Another example would be if I 

were to say that that glass would not hold more than 8 

ounces of water, that would mean that it could not hold 

more than 8 ounces of water.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, I don't think it would 

mean that.

 JUSTICE BREYER: A glass --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Anything that could not be 

done of course would not be done. But that doesn't mean 

that the -- that the two words mean the same thing.

 MR. MILLER: But --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's true that one is 

included within the other, but they don't mean the same 

thing.

 MR. MILLER: Would -- I think that the 

unadorned use of the word "would" here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What could not happen would 

not happen, of course. But it doesn't mean that -- the 

two concepts are not the same.

 MR. MILLER: I think, when -- when you have 

the word "would," as we have in this statute, that's not 

qualified in any way, it's ambiguous in the sense that

it can mean definitely would not have been incurred, 

probably would not have been incurred, customarily, 

ordinarily would not have been incurred, which is the 

meaning --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You didn't think 

much of this argument before the Second Circuit adopted 

it, did you? You didn't argue this before the Court of 

Appeals?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MILLER: We did not argue it before --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you have a 

fallback argument.

 MR. MILLER: Well, that -- that's right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, now might be a 

good time to fall back.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Before -- I mean, we have 

lots of good examples. I mean, I could have colored my 

room at home, painted it with light green plastic, but I 

wouldn't have done it. I mean, endless examples.

 MR. MILLER: Right. And certainly the 

statute also admits of the reading given to it by the 

Fourth and Federal Circuits, which is that "would not 

have been incurred" means customarily or ordinarily 

would not have been incurred by individuals.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If we can rush to the 

fallback position, is it acceptable to have a test that 

says would the expense have been incurred if the 

nontrust business wanted to achieve an objective that 

the trust wanted to achieve here, fixing the roof?

 MR. MILLER: I -- I think that that raises 

the question of what is the relevant comparison group 

for -- for individuals outside of the trust side of it.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I think the structure 

of the statute requires us to -- to do that.

 MR. MILLER: That's right. And -- and we 

would suggest that the relevant comparison is 

individuals with -- with similar assets, right, because 

it's in the absence of a trust, not if the property did 

not exist. So you have to look at an individual who 

held those assets outright, and an individual with those 

assets trying to achieve those goals might well seek 

investment advice.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Will, you give as an example 

of something that wouldn't fall within the 2 percent 

floor the cost of preparing and filing a fiduciary 

income tax return. What is the difference between that 

and getting fiduciary investment advice?

different form that's filled out?

 MR. MILLER: What --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is it more expensive to --

to fill out a 1041 than to fill out the 1040?

 MR. MILLER: It's more expensive because 

it's an additional cost. If an individual were to hold 

the property outright, he or she would simply put the 

income from that property on his own 1040. If in 

addition there is a trust, then the trust has to fill 

out a 1041, the trust also has to prepare Form K-1s and 

send them out both to the beneficiaries and to the IRS, 

showing the beneficiaries' share of the trust income, 

and then the individual still has to file a 1040. So 

the existence of the trust has created this whole 

additional set of filing and reporting obligations.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but it's the 

individual who has to file the 1040. What the trustee 

is filing is the 1041. And -- and why do you place -- I 

was going to ask the same question that Justice Alito 

did, and that is why do you place so much significance 

either in the label, i.e., it's fiduciary return, or in 

the peculiar fact that it is a fiduciary who is filing 

that return?

 It's a tax return and -- and I think your --

the government's argument is that with respect to -- to

other items that may be disputed, you should regard them 

at a fairly general level, i.e., investment advice, not 

fiduciary investment advice. But when you come to the 

tax return, you don't regard it as a general -- at a 

general level; you regard it at a very specific level, 

i.e., a fiduciary tax return. It seems to me that the 

government with respect to the tax return is doing 

exactly what it criticizes the taxpayer for doing with 

respect to investment advice. And I don't understand 

the distinction.

 MR. MILLER: With respect to the tax return, 

it's not that it's a fiduciary tax return as opposed to 

an individual tax return; it's that it's an extra tax 

return that has to be filed.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's the only tax 

return that the fiduciary has to file; isn't that 

correct? The fiduciary files that tax return and the 

beneficiary files a 1040.

 MR. MILLER: That's right, but if the 

beneficiary --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But the only return the 

fiduciary's filing is the 1041; isn't that right?

 MR. MILLER: That's the only -- but in that 

-- in the system of the beneficiary and the fiduciary 

there are two tax returns that have to be filed, whereas

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay; I understand that 

that is a factual difference, but I don't understand 

what it is that makes that a difference in principle.

 MR. MILLER: I think that -- that's an extra 

obligation that would not have been incurred in the 

absence of the trust. And I think, turning to the case 

of investment advice, I think there is really no level 

of generality or particularity at which one can look at 

investment advice such that there is anything unique 

about trust investment advice.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, can't you ask it --

can't -- can't you ask this question pointing towards 

something unique: If the individual investor does a 

very poor job of managing his investments, all he can 

ultimately do is cry about it. But if the trustee does 

a very poor job, the trustee is going to get sued. So 

that when the trustee asks for an investment advisor's 

advice, the trustee is addressing an issue that the 

individual does not have. The trustee wants to be 

covered. He also, I presume, wants to be a good 

trustee. But he is in fact doing something which is, to 

use your phrase, in addition to what the individual 

investor would do. He is looking out for somebody else 

and he is looking out for himself if the investment goes

south. Why isn't that a sufficient difference that is 

at least comparable to the difference that you talk 

about in the filing of a fiduciary tax return?

 MR. MILLER: It's not a difference, because 

if the individual invests poorly he'll lose money. And 

if the -- and he'll lose his own money. If the 

fiduciary invests poorly he may get sued and the measure 

of damages in that suit will be the amount of money he 

lost. So they're both facing the possibility of losing.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but whether -- whether 

he gets socked with damages or not is going to depend in 

part whether he is covered by an investment advisor's 

bit of advice; and that is -- that is a different item 

in the calculus of liability. He is providing for 

something that the individual investor does not provide 

for or need to provide for.

 MR. MILLER: Well, the -- the standard of 

conduct that is supposed to govern the fiduciary is the 

prudent investor rule, which looks at what a reasonable 

prudent individual would do in managing his own money so 

I think that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I have the same 

problem. You know, I -- it seems to me that it is 

entirely reasonable to say only a trustee can seek 

investment advice concerning what he should do to

fulfill his responsibilities under the trust. Only a 

trustee can do that. A private individual might seek 

investment advice as to how he could maximize the income 

or -- or the growth of the funds that he has, but 

only -- only a trustee seeks advice as to how he can 

fulfill his responsibilities under the trust. And you 

could say that's distinctive. No individual would do 

that because he's not a trustee.

 MR. MILLER: But there's no distinction in 

that case in the -- in the fee that's charged or in the 

advice that's given by the investment advisor. In 

either case somebody goes to the advisor and says, I 

have the following goals that I want to achieve with 

this money. It may be my money; it may be a trust's 

money. And the advisor thinks about those goals and 

comes up with -- with investment advice. And those 

goals --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It may -- it may well be 

the same advice, but in -- but in one case it is -- it 

is advice sought by and given to a trustee, a unique 

kind of advice. In -- in substance, it may turn out to 

be the same; but it's not the same advice you're giving 

to a private individual. You're saying here's the trust 

instrument and here are the objects to be achieved by 

the trust instrument and this is the -- the advice that

will best do that. That doesn't happen with an 

individual.

 MR. MILLER: I mean, but for the fact that 

the word "trust" is in there, I think the substance of 

the interaction with the investment advisor is exactly 

the same.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But doesn't your proposed 

regulation concede that there is investment advisory 

advice that is unique to -- to estates and trusts? 

Isn't that what subparagraph C says?

 MR. MILLER: No. Subparagraph C has two 

lists, both of which are nonexclusive: a list of items 

that are unique to trusts and a list of items that are 

not unique to trusts. In the list of items that are not 

unique to trusts is investing for total return. There 

is no type of investment advice --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why that limitation? Why 

wouldn't it say just "investment advice," but it's --

investing for total return is more limited?

 MR. MILLER: I think perhaps because that's 

most obviously the type of advice that is not unique to 

trusts. But the -- the proposed regulation does not 

identify any kind of advice that is unique to trusts.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It doesn't say it's one 

or the other. So it's not so sure, right? It's sure

about advice on investing for total return.

 MR. MILLER: And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In other words, the 

regulation, the proposed regulation, doesn't answer this 

case of investment advice in general as opposed to 

advice on investing for total return.

 MR. MILLER: You're right that the 

regulation in terms of the enumeration in subsection (b) 

is silent on the question of other types of --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Can you really spice up 

advice that way? You ask the advisor, say, which --

what percentage of your advice was the advice that went 

to maximizing total return and what percentage went to 

this other thing? I mean, gee, I don't want to get 

courts into trying to figure that out, or private 

individuals or financial advisors in trying to figure 

that out. That's just a crazy way to run a tax system, 

it seems to me.

 MR. MILLER: I think that's right, and 

that's why I think that the -- despite the fact that 

investing for total return is the only example given in 

the list, which, again, is described as not exclusive. 

I think the best reading of the proposed regulation is 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But that's not all advice.

That's just some of the advice, right?

 MR. MILLER: Yes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Now, what about the rest of 

it? How do you slice up, you know -- now, investment 

advisor, tell me what percentage of your advice went to 

the total return and what percentage went to other 

things. I don't think the investment advisor is going 

to be able to tell you.

 MR. MILLER: I think the best reading of the 

proposed regulation, and perhaps the Service may well 

clarify this during the rule-making process, is that all 

advice is not unique to trusts because there's no type 

of advice that a trustee could seek that an individual 

could not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: They certainly weren't 

sure about it when they drafted this regulation, 

proposed regulation.

 MR. MILLER: Well, it is -- it's just a 

proposal, again, and I think they picked what's perhaps 

the most obvious.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But in other categories, 

they express no such limitation. Custody or management 

of property, not qualified. And they -- but when you 

get to investing, it has that total return. Everything 

else has got maintenance, repair, insurance.

MR. MILLER: That's right. And there's also 

a fairly extensive list of nonexclusive -- of nonunique 

products or services, and that does not include any 

other type of investment advice. So I think what one 

can draw the opposite inference from that list, but in 

any event, that's something that could be clarified in 

the rule-making process.

 Returning to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So how does your 

customary or commonly incurred test work? Let's say you 

have two trusts, one $10 million, the other 10,000. I 

think an individual with $10 million might well seek 

investment advice, but an individual with only 10,000 

might decide it's not worth it. Would you have a 

different application of the 2 percent rule for those 

two trusts?

 MR. MILLER: I think if the test is whether 

-- whether the individuals would have -- would commonly 

ordinarily incur that cost, I think one might well look 

at that because the comparison would be individuals with 

similar assets, and, as Your Honor knows, there might be 

a difference depending on the size.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many -- how many 

individuals do you need? Let's say it's $3 million in 

the trust, and we think maybe 60 percent of people would

hire an investment advisor; 40 percent would think they 

can do just as well on their own. Is that customarily 

incurred by individuals?

 MR. MILLER: I think it might well be enough 

that -- for something that the Service could clarify 

through --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your answer to both 

questions is "might well be," and that's a fairly vague 

line when it comes to taxes.

 MR. MILLER: The --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And whatever line you --

you pick, I guarantee you, trusts are going to break 

themselves up into mini-trusts that fall under the line. 

I mean people aren't stupid.

 (Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Or, even worse, 

advisors are going to break themselves up into different 

advisors. There's going to be somebody who says I'm a 

fiduciary advisor whenever a trustee calls, but, I'm a 

normal advisor, when it's an individual.

 MR. MILLER: I think the difficulty in 

applying that test is one of the reasons why we suggest 

that the categorical -- the more categorical approach, 

which we think is also a permissible reading of the 

statute, is the preferable one. But, in either event,

if the test is customarily or ordinarily incurred, it 

was Petitioner's obligation in the tax court to show 

that they qualified for the exemption from the 2 percent 

floor. And so it would be Petitioner's burden to show 

that this is a cost not that's customarily or ordinarily 

incurred by individuals.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's your best 

case for that proposition? Your colleague resisted the 

notion that he had the burden and what's your best case 

for that?

 MR. MILLER: It's not a case, but it's the 

rule. Tax Court Rule 142 places the burden of proof on 

the taxpayer. Petitioner sites --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought that 

rule applied to the applicability of individual 

exemptions. Here we have a different question. It's 

how to read an exception to the general rule. Do you 

have a case for a proposition that the taxpayer has the 

burden in those cases? You said that in your brief, but 

it didn't have a case cite with it.

 MR. MILLER: No. We don't have a case, but 

the rule is unqualified in terms of its applicability. 

It doesn't say only on particular issues. And the case 

that Petitioner cites is United States against Janis, 

which is about a "naked" assessment, which is far

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you saying --

MR. MILLER: A "naked" assessment is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are we saying, as a 

question of law, the taxpayer has the burden of proof? 

If it isn't a question of proof, it isn't a question of 

evidence?

 MR. MILLER: No. I was referring to 

questions of fact. I understood the question to be if 

the legal test turns on the factual question of what is 

it, what is customary or ordinary for individuals to 

incur, then on that fact, that would be a factual issue.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what would -- that's 

why I made the suggestion I had earlier. I was doubtful 

about the wisdom of trying to turn this matter into a 

purely factual one. And so suppose you said, which 

would come to about the same thing, that expenditure 

would be incurred in this instance by someone who didn't 

hold these assets in trust. What that means is would a 

-- an investor not in the trust, not holding it in 

trust, reasonably have been, or a reasonable investor 

have been likely to make this expenditure? That turns 

it into a more quasi-legal question where people -- and 

then it's a matter of judgment, which these things do 

come down to. That's what judges are there for, to

judge. And thereby we avoid the burden-of-proof 

problem. It comes to about the same thing. Is there 

any objection to it? What's the reason not to do it?

 MR. MILLER: If that is the test, then it's 

very easy to apply to the case of investment advice, 

because we know that the trustee's obligation is to act 

as a reasonable and prudent individual would. And so we 

know that if -- to the extent that the trustee seeks 

investment advice in pursuance of that obligation --

JUSTICE BREYER: But are you --

MR. MILLER: -- that would --

JUSTICE BREYER: You would be, of course, 

exactly right, that there could be trusts, very big 

trusts. Children get into fights trying to split up the 

assets. Millions is paid on lawyers and investment 

advisors to see if each share, figured 14 different 

ways, is going to earn this money or that money. And 

that kind of thing exists. And there the investment 

advisors are likely to be special. So you can't say 

investment advice is always special or never special.

 Now, again, this seems to me not unknown, 

this kind of problem, to the Internal Revenue law, and 

therefore there tend to be methods of allowing 

exceptions, of putting burdens. I mean, is this case 

somehow -- am I wrong about that?

MR. MILLER: I think that to the extent that 

you're suggesting that the Service could be -- could 

clarify the statute through the use of regulations, we 

certainly agree with that. The service has the ability 

to resolve some of the ambiguities.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm looking really for a 

form of words to write that does not use the word 

"could" but which gets at what I think the statute was 

after, which is: Let them have this no floor for their 

special stuff but not for ordinary stuff that others 

would have incurred regardless. I want to know what 

form of words. I find it difficult to go beyond the 

statute, frankly.

occurred" is pretty good --

right.

are unique to --

write?

 MR. MILLER: I think "ordinarily" or 

"customarily" is also a permissible interpretation of --

JUSTICE BREYER: If had you to choose 

between that and getting the idea of the reasonable 

taxpayer who didn't hold this in trust, which would you 

choose?

 MR. MILLER: I think they are actually very 

similar inquiries, because we expect that the reasonable 

person is the ordinary person. So I think in practice, 

those formulations get you to the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It almost sounds like 

ordinary and necessary under 162?

 MR. MILLER: Well, ordinary and necessary 

under -- I mean here we are talking about -- as 

Mr. Rubin said, it's under 212.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 212. I understand that.

 MR. MILLER: It's not in connection with a 

trade or business. Ordinary and necessary in that 

context means simply that it's a legitimately connected 

to the production of income. That's a requirement for 

it to be deductible at all.

 JUSTICE ALITO: It seems to me the 

difficulty is in characterizing the level of generality 

at which you describe the cost, not whether it's

ordinary or customary or unique. You run into the same 

problem no matter how you do that, but you have to 

decide whether you're talking about investment advice or 

fiduciary investment advice, tax preparation costs or 

fiduciary tax preparation costs. And what is the 

formula for making that distinction?

 MR. MILLER: I think what the Service is 

trying to do in the proposed regulation and what we have 

suggested is appropriate is simply a common sense 

practical approach to that. And there may be some 

difficult cases at the margin. And that's one of the 

things that the service will try to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And this must be one. 

The Service must think this is one because it was 

certain about the tax return. It says tax return that 

doesn't get the subject to the 2 percent but only this 

kind of investment advice for total return. So that the 

Service didn't see this as a clear and certain category.

 MR. MILLER: Again, I think what the Service 

was doing there was picking out just the most obvious 

example. But there simply is no such thing as fiduciary 

investment advice that is distinct from --

JUSTICE ALITO: How do we deal with this 

problem until there is a regulation? It may be that if 

the Service issues a regulation and says that these fall

into one category and these fall into the other, that 

would be entitled to a deference. But right now we 

don't have a regulation, right? So what do we do?

 MR. MILLER: I think what we have suggested 

is there are two -- there are a couple of possible 

readings of the statute based on the ambiguity in the 

word "would." And in the absence of a regulation, we 

are not suggesting that the Service's position is 

entitled to deference under Chevron. But I think some 

deference to the consistent position of the Service 

since the statute was enacted that the investment advice 

be subject to the 2 percent floor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you the same 

question I asked your adversary? Whether you use the 

term "could" or "customarily" or whatever you're 

formulating, the bottom line, as I understand your 

position, is that these costs will never be deductible?

 MR. MILLER: They will -- they will be 

deductible but they will be subject to the floor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But they will never -- you 

would not say some trusts yes, and some trusts no?

 MR. MILLER: Well, under -- I mean, if the 

test were customarily or ordinarily, it might be the 

case that a trust could show that given the nature of 

the assets in it, if it were --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you have to have a 

case-by-case analysis of the facts as to whether the 

particular advice would have been sought, whether the 

advice was by a trustee or by an individual?

 MR. MILLER: It's not -- we are not 

suggesting that it's at the level of that particular 

advice. The question would be --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The cost of the advice? 

What percentage of the costs incurred by a trust do you 

think the investment advice consists of? I mean, it 

seems to me the main thing a trustee ordinarily does, at 

least if he is a trustee of just cash, is to invest it. 

It seems to me his major expense must be getting 

financial advice, isn't that right?

 MR. MILLER: I don't know the answer to 

that. The Service --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, imagine something 

else. Guess. What other, what other expense could even 

approximate that?

 MR. MILLER: One --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And then my follow-up is, 

is there any -- I don't care about legislative history 

but some of my colleagues do. Is there any -- is there 

any indication that Congress thought it was, it was

to their major expenditure? I expect it must be their 

major expenditure.

 MR. MILLER: To take your second question 

first, the legislative history is silent on specifically 

what Congress's objective was in section 67(e).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The dog didn't bark.

 MR. MILLER: But I think -- but I think what 

one can infer from legislative history of the '86 Act 

and more broadly and from the text of the statute is 

that Congress wanted property to be treated the same, 

regardless of whether it was held by an individual 

outright or held by a trust. So if an individual would 

incur certain costs if he held the property outright, 

those costs shouldn't be able to escape the 2 percent 

floor simply because the property is placed into a 

trust. But if the trust -- the existence of the trust 

relationship creates some new or additional costs that 

would not have existed otherwise, then those are not 

subjected to the 2 percent clause.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you know a trust is 

sort of like a business. And deductions that an 

individual could not take if he were not in a business 

are perfectly okay for a business. And I don't know why 

trusts wouldn't be treated the same way. A trust has to 

get investment advice. True? When it's -- when it's an

individual getting it, you wouldn't allow a deduction, 

but a trust is different.

 And unless Congress is clearer than this 

statute, I -- it seems to me that no individual would 

get trust investment advice. Only a trust can get trust 

investment advice.

 MR. MILLER: Well, individuals could get --

could and do get investment advice that is no different 

in substance from the advice the trust might get. And a 

trustee might decide that he didn't need investment 

advice if the trustee is financially sophisticated and 

doesn't need an advisor. To go --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What if you get a 

bill from the investor advisor, and it's $50,000 and 

it's broken up, 30,000 is general stock picking advice, 

and 20 percent is specialized fiduciary advice? In 

other words, they figure out what good stocks are they 

pushing these days and they go down and say, well, 

you're a trustee, you can't buy this you can't buy that. 

You would -- would you agree that the $20,000 is not 

subject to the 2 percent floor but the 30,000 is?

 MR. MILLER: Yes. As we acknowledged in our 

brief, if the advisor -- or another example would be if 

the advisor imposed some extra charge on the fiduciary 

accounts for whatever reason, that would be an expense

that an individual going to that same advisor could not 

incur or ordinarily would not incur.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But the individual who 

wanted to maximize income, for example, if the trustee 

has to maximize income for some of the life 

beneficiaries or something, an individual could seek 

that same advice if he wanted that particular result 

from the investment, couldn't he?

 MR. MILLER: That's right. I understood the 

question to refer to the case where the advisor charges 

some extra fee because the client is a trust.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Oh, I didn't understand it 

to be that. I thought it was going to be, you know, the 

advisor had to figure out we need so much for the, for 

the remainder man and so much for the life beneficiaries 

and so forth. You don't think that would be enough?

 MR. MILLER: No. No. It wouldn't be.

 Thank you.

to individuals, both because of the demanding legal 

obligations specifying certain factors that have to be 

taken into account by the trustee in investing and 

because of the risk of personal liability.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What do you have to 

support that? I resist accepting that broad 

proposition, and I don't know where to look or who to 

ask in order to determine its -- its truth or falsity.

 MR. RUBIN: Well, I think, Your Honor, if 

you look at, at our brief, at pages 7 through 10, there 

is a discussion of the specific legal factors that are 

codified in Connecticut law in the Uniform Prudent 

Investor Act, which does not, as the Commissioner 

suggested, require people to invest as a prudent 

individual, but it's a different standard.

 So, for example, safe investments, 

conservative investments are not permitted any more in 

many circumstances to trustees when an individual could 

well engage in that kind of investment. Investment in 

areas that the trustee is familiar with is not adequate 

to meet this obligation. So the advice really is 

tailored as a matter of state law in the trust 

instrument in every case to the trust.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it could also be 

tailored to an individual with particular circumstances

that are similar to that of the trust. So an individual 

could incur it. An individual with the same amount of 

money involved probably would incur it.

 MR. RUBIN: No trust, Your Honor, has 

exactly the same circumstances as a trust, because 

trusts always have, by definition, more than one 

beneficiary. There is always a remainder beneficiary, 

at least. Ordinarily there will be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So an individual 

might have more than one child he wants to provide for 

and as far as a remainder, there may be more than one 

grandchild. It could be exactly the same -- an 

individual could have exactly the same objectives as a 

trustee.

 MR. RUBIN: The decision process for the 

investments will be different in the case of a trustee, 

though, than for an individual. And a trust, of course, 

could be multigenerational. This trust will probably 

last for about a hundred years from the time that it was 

initially adopted.

 I should also say --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Rubin, is it the advice 

that's different or is it -- is it the inquiry that's 

different.

 MR. RUBIN: Both. The decision -- the

decision to hire the investment advisor is an exercise 

of fiduciary judgment taking into account these -- these 

factors; and the advice that you're paying for is a 

different service that's tailored to the trust. This, 

therefore -- the Commissioner acknowledges that -- that 

the -- that trusts are distinct. But -- but resists 

the -- the analogy between, for example, fiduciary 

income tax returns or judicial accountings and other tax 

returns.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Rubin, is there a 

subcategory of investment advisors who hold themselves 

out to be fiduciary investment advisors?

 MR. RUBIN: I believe, Your Honor, there may 

be specific fees for trust investments that are offered 

by firms that -- that provide investment advice. 

Whether there are specific advisors who will take only 

fiduciary clients, I don't --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Or even those who 

advertise themselves as specialists in fiduciary advice? 

I never heard of them. Maybe there are.

 MR. RUBIN: Well, I think that this actually 

points out, Justice Stevens, part of the problem with 

the Commissioner's position, which is it relies on 

labels. The Commissioner has said it's a common --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: As far as a tax return,

are there accountants this specialize in trust tax 

returns as opposed to individual or corporate returns?

 MR. RUBIN: Not that I know of, Your Honor. 

My sense is that an income tax preparer will be willing 

to prepare an income tax return for a fiduciary or an 

individual. I see that my time has expired.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Rubin. The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
