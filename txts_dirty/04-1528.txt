(10:11 a.m.) 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in 04-1528, Randall v. Sorrell, and 

the consolidated cases. 

Mr. Bopp. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR. 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

IN NOS. 04-1528 AND 04-1530 

MR. BOPP: Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

As this Court made clear recently in 

Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, since political 

candidates are the ones who take office, it is 

imperative that they be allowed freely to express 

themselves on matters of current public importance. As 

a result, this Court has never allowed the government 

to prohibit candidates from communicating relevant 

information to voters during an election. 

Vermont, however, has adopted low expenditure 

and contribution limits for the opposite purpose, 

reducing overall candidate campaign spending, and these 

limits would have that effect. This is fundamentally 

incompatible with any reasonable interpretation of the 

First Amendment and is not justified by any truly

compelling governmental interest. As a result, they 

are unconstitutional. 

Now, Vermont's expenditure limits are an 

unprecedented, direct restraint on candidate speech. 

Once these low expenditure limits are exhausted, a 

candidate may not drive to the village green to address 

a rally, may not return the phone call from a reporter 

at the local newspaper, and may not call a neighbor to 

urge her to get out to vote. This Court has never 

allowed the government to prohibit candidates from 

communicating this sort of relevant information during 

a campaign. 

Further, this Court has long held that more 

speech is better than less speech. As long as 

contribution limits are available to address any 

realistic concerns about corruption, the public will 

benefit from candidates' being allowed to spend all 

that they can lawfully raise in their campaign. 

Now, the record is clear in this case that 

the expenditure limits will deprive candidates of 

substantial resources. The district court erroneously 

looked at average spending over the last three 

elections and found that in all but one category, that 

is, Senate candidates running in single-member 

districts, that the average spending for all candidates

in those campaigns were below the limits set by the 

expenditure limits in Vermont. 

However, in Buckley, the last case for --

where this Court considered candidate expenditure 

limits, the Court looked at the number of races 

affected, not the average spending in all races. And 

in Buckley, the Court looked at the expenditures in 

U.S. Senate races and found that in previous election, 

that 26 percent were over the mandatory expenditure 

limits considered in Buckley, and in the House, 3 

percent of the races had spending greater than the --

these limits. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bopp, would you 

clarify a procedural point? As I understand it, on the 

expenditure issue, there is no final decision that has 

gone back to the district court for further 

proceedings. 

MR. BOPP: Well, there were -- that is 

correct, that there is a remand. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And it may -- the district 

court might -- may well find that nothing passes 

constitutional muster in the end. 

MR. BOPP: Well, they could potentially, yes. 

However, the -- the Second Circuit did -- did make 

decisions of law. They found that these two interests

that the State is alleging, that is, in preventing 

corruption and in conserving incumbent time, were 

together a compelling governmental interest, and we --

we allege that they are not and that on this record, 

this Court can determine that they are not -- they are 

not together a compelling governmental interest. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you arguing now then 

that there may be no limits on expenditures? 

MR. BOPP: Well, the -- this Court has now 

considered, including this case, a dozen times in which 

the government has sought to limit expenditures, either 

of candidates or PAC's or political parties, and 

despite the work of the most brilliant lawyers in the 

United States, they have not come up with any 

compelling governmental interest that this Court has 

accepted. And we believe that this record demonstrates 

that these claimed interests either are not compelling 

or are not proven. 

Now --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- when -- when you 

make that point, that on this record the -- the claimed 

interests are not compelling or not proven, would you 

have us leave the door open for a greater degree of 

proof? For example, take the -- the problem of 

candidate time. The lower the donation limits are, the

-- the more donations there have got to be, and -- and 

there's -- there's plenty of comment, particularly in 

some of the amicus briefs, on the amount of time that 

political candidates generally spend scrounging around 

for money. If we decided the case your way, would the 

door be left open for a more impressive and compelling 

record on this issue? 

MR. BOPP: Well, we -- we are asserting that 

that is not a compelling interest in and of itself, and 

this Court should reject it. I -- I just don't see --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But you also say, on this 

record. 

MR. BOPP: Yes. And in addition -- well, the 

-- the point about it not being a compelling interest I 

think is an analytical point that doesn't have to be --

that doesn't rest on this -- strictly on this record. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: So I -- I take it your point 

then on the combined corruption/competition for money 

problem is that there isn't any record that would 

support it. 

MR. BOPP: If it were a compelling interest, 

there's no record here that is a problem in Vermont. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Right, but you're saying 

this combination cannot be a compelling interest as a 

matter of law, consistent with the First Amendment. Is

that correct? 

MR. BOPP: Yes, it is. I don't see how it is 

a compelling governmental interest to limit challengers 

to only fund-raise to the extent that an incumbent 

finds comfortable or convenient. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, just --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or at least where -- where 

the limitation -- you make a big point of this in your 

brief as -- as I -- as I recall. At least where the 

reason the candidate would have to spend so much time 

is the very small contribution limit established by the 

same statute. It's -- it's rather like the -- the 

murderer asking for mercy because he's an orphan, 

having killed his parents. 

MR. BOPP: It is a self-justifying statute by 

imposing the lowest contribution limits in -- in the 

Nation, adjusted for inflation for 1974 dollars, when 

the $1,000 limit was approved. This is a contribution 

limit of $50 for an --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, to get back to 

Justice Souter's questions, could you answer it this 

way? Let's assume that some members of the Court 

simply accepted the proposition that money buys access. 

And -- and I don't think maybe we can take judicial of

that, but I -- I think that's a common sense conclusion 

that we can reach. And you tend to fight this in your 

brief to say that this doesn't happen. I tend to doubt 

that. I tend to think money does buy access. What --

if -- if we or I were to conclude that, what would 

follow? 

MR. BOPP: Well, I think it's not a matter of 

just access. It has to be a matter of privileged 

access that this Court found in the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right. Let's say it's 

privileged access. 

MR. BOPP: Well, if it -- if it's privileged 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I mean, isn't the answer 

that the -- that this is up to the voters. The voters 

can see what's going on and throw the legislator out if 

they choose. 

MR. BOPP: Indeed, and in fact, the -- there 

are other less restrictive ways of -- of dealing with 

this. For -- for instance, Vermont prohibits 

contributions from lobbyists during the session. Other 

legislatures have imposed a prohibition on incumbents 

from raising any money during the time the legislative 

session -- the legislature is in session. So there are 

ways of dealing with the question of access that are

not the blunderbuss approach here. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It -- it is true that all 

the polls say that there's public disaffection and 

cynicism. Does that translate into action to defeat 

incumbents who take particularly large sums of money? 

Is there -- is there statistical evidence to show that? 

MR. BOPP: I'm not aware of that. But 

certainly the press and opponents often, you know, 

point to examples where they believe that their 

challenger is under too much of an influence of a 

particular entity, and the voters, you know, in certain 

circumstances take that into account in their voting. 

And furthermore, it is true that there is a 

general cynicism about politicians and government that 

has existed since the first colonists came to our 

country and continues today. In fact, our governmental 

system is established on the proposition that we need 

to limit the -- the government, and we need to have 

checks and balances because we don't want free rein by 

politicians because we are concerned about their 

exercise of power. 

But if this is enough --

JUSTICE STEVENS: May ask you this question, 

Mr. Bopp? This -- in -- following up on Justice 

Ginsburg's inquiry, is it your view that there is no

set of facts, no matter how scandalous and so forth and 

so on, Watergate and all the rest of it, could ever 

justify an expenditure limit? 

MR. BOPP: That is not our position. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, if that's the case, 

then why -- why would it be inappropriate to have 

further hearings in this case to see whether they're --

they could be justified? 

MR. BOPP: Because there have been legal 

findings by the Second Circuit that we believe are 

erroneous. The -- the first, as I mentioned 

previously, is that -- that we do not believe that the 

-- preserving incumbents' time through expenditure 

limits can ever be a compelling governmental interest, 

to limit what challengers can spend -- raise and spend 

in their own election. I mean, this interest -- the 

expenditure limits don't apply just to incumbents who 

-- if there is a concern about --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I understand. I'm just 

curious to know what sort of -- what sort of evidence 

could ever support an -- an expenditure limit in your 

view, if -- if any. 

MR. BOPP: I have a -- a very difficult time 

justifying expenditure limits. 

I know there's a debate on this Court on

whether or not there are per se situations under the 

First Amendment. If there was ever a candidate for a 

per se First Amendment ban on a law, surely it would be 

this type of case. In other words, we are talking 

about speech that is at the core of the First 

Amendment, and secondly, we are talking about candidate 

speech. Candidates are the ones that go into office. 

They are the ones that are going to be exercising 

governmental power. These low expenditure and 

contribution limits would have the effect of making 

candidates a bit player in their own election so that 

the voters --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, with respect 

to the contribution limits, what -- what makes this 

case different from the -- the Shrink PAC case from a 

few years ago? 

MR. BOPP: Well, several things. First is 

there was actually a paucity of evidence in the Shrink 

PAC case. There was only an allegation of one PAC that 

wanted to give one contribution to one candidate, and 

this Court said that, you know, you didn't need a lot 

of evidence to combat such a weak -- weak claim. 

So secondly is the novelty and plausibility 

of a -- adjusted for per election in 1974 dollars of a 

$50 contribution limit, that that would actually give

rise to realistic concern about actual and perceived 

corruption. So, again, in Shrink PAC --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you think it --

you think it's the dollar amounts that are involved? 

MR. BOPP: Well, one of the decisions that 

the Court has to make under your jurisprudence is that 

-- that contribution limits can only eliminate large 

contributions that give rise to this realistic 

perception or actuality of corruption. So it is --

whether it's large or not and giving rise to that 

concern because of the size, that is an integral part 

of the Shrink analysis. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: It -- it was pointed out in 

-- in one of the briefs -- and I -- I didn't go back 

and check it myself, but I'd like your comment. It was 

pointed out in one of the briefs that the limits in 

Vermont were substantially close to or even -- even 

higher than the -- than the limits in the Missouri 

scheme, out of which the Shrink litigation grew. Do 

you know whether that is correct? 

MR. BOPP: Well, it depends on how you -- you 

compute it. The --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It always -- it always does, 

yes.

 MR. BOPP: The -- well, certainly what the --

what the evidence was in Shrink was it was a $1,075 

limit, again adjusted for inflation, was about $375 

adjusted for inflation compared to the Buckley limits, 

and because of the paucity of evidence and the fact 

that it wasn't really novel to say that a $1,000 limit 

could give rise to corruption because --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there were lower 

limits, Mr. Bopp, and I think that's what Justice 

Souter was asking about. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There were the thousand 

dollars, but I think it went down as low as $250 in --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, take the whole schedule 

in Missouri. 

MR. BOPP: Yes. Well, the -- the 

contribution limits that this Court considered was the 

$1,075 --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There -- there was a court 

that subsequently considered the rest and upheld the 

contribution --

MR. BOPP: Yes, there was. The Eighth 

Circuit did so and the -- the lowest limit there was 

$275 per election, which would be $500 for -- for the 

-- the entire election cycle. And the -- and -- but

really that -- that was on a -- a record that this 

Court found to be, frankly, inadequate to -- to raise 

any serious questions about the -- whether the amounts 

concerned gave rise to a realistic threat of 

corruption. 

And the record here demonstrates that -- that 

the -- that the only time really there is a actuality 

or perception of corruption in Vermont is when they --

is when we're talking about amounts in excess of 

$1,000. That was the prior limit. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And we -- we didn't send it 

back so that more of a record could be made, did we? 

MR. BOPP: No. No. 

And, you know, we had a 10-day trial. We had 

numerous witnesses here. The -- Shrink had been 

decided. I mean, there was -- everything was before 

the court to consider the -- the matter. 

And so, you know, they had their chance at --

at proof. And -- and in the numerous witnesses, they 

made their best case. They could not identify one 

single politician in Vermont that was -- that anyone 

would -- would claim was corrupted in any way by a 

contribution -- by contributions under $1,000. They 

could not name one single incumbent politician in 

Vermont that neglected any specific duty that he or she

that's a lot to ask. 

MR. BOPP: Well -- well, they at least have 

to give, you know, realistic circumstances. They gave 

a few circumstances --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, suppose three 

legislators had been corrupted, venal, criminal 

corruption, actually taking no wink-wink, nod-nod, a 

specific agreement to vote for money. So what? Does 

that change your case? 

MR. BOPP: Well, the -- the responsibility 

that Shrink imposes is to -- to demonstrate both actual 

and perceived corruption at that the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose -- suppose that had 

been demonstrated in -- in a particular State. Does 

that mean, in your view, that a State can have strict 

contribution limits and support? 

MR. BOPP: If it's just anecdotal, no. It 

has to be --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. It's true. It's --

it's done. There have been criminal convictions. 

MR. BOPP: Well, the -- if it's isolated 

examples that are unconnected to any perception of 

corruption at that level, then it would not be adequate 

on -- on its -- on its -- by itself. 

Now, of course, in Shrink, the Court cited to 

both actual and perceived evidence of corruption at the 

level that the -- you were considering that limit. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well -- well, if -- if you 

-- if you concede and -- and you tend, at least, to 

back away from the proposition that the case I put 

would be an inadequate ground or an adequate ground for 

legislative limits, then I suppose you can say the 

State has the power to prevent this from happening to 

begin with. 

MR. BOPP: Well, this Court has never 

approved restrictions on fundamental First Amendment 

values based purely upon speculation or concern about 

something that's happening some other place. In other 

words, these are real limits on people in Vermont, and 

it seems to me that to approve the lowest contribution 

limits in the Nation and these very low expenditure 

limits, the State would have to demonstrate that 

Vermont is the most corrupt State in the Nation. And 

they're far from it. In fact, the opposite --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Only -- only the most 

corruptible. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. BOPP: Nor corruptible. The -- the 

evidence is quite clear. Even in the few examples that 

they cite to like the tobacco industry passing out $40 

checks after a -- a vote defeating a bill. Of course, 

that's still legal under this -- this act. But, you 

know, even pointing out that they -- that the person 

who talked about that example made it clear that he 

didn't believe anybody was -- was influenced by post-

contributions after a vote regarding a matter that's 

not even prohibited by this -- by this act. 

So it was -- it was a lot of testimony about 

how truly clean Vermont is, not the most corrupt, where 

people -- politicians would be tempted at these quite 

low limits to, you know, sell their honor and -- and 

personal, you know -- and their -- and affect their 

own, you know, personal character and reputation. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Bopp, toward the end of 

your brief, you -- you make the argument that if we 

accepted the State's position in this case, we 

implicitly would have accepted the position that 

totally -- totally publicly funded elections would be 

constitutional. And -- and I -- I realize your -- your

concern there was with expenditure limits, obviously, 

not contribution limits. You didn't come out and say 

it, but I -- I assume your position is that that would 

be unconstitutional per se. A totally publicly funded 

scheme would be unconstitutional per se. 

MR. BOPP: The key would be if it's mandated, 

voluntary --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes. 

MR. BOPP: If it was mandated, yes, it would 

be unconstitutional. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and its 

unconstitutionality would rest on the limitation on 

expenditure, in effect? 

MR. BOPP: Yes. Oh, yes. Well, there would 

be a prohibition in that case if I understand your --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, yes, yes. 

MR. BOPP: -- on -- on contributions, and 

there would be also a -- a mandatory expenditure limit 

because you could only spend what the government gave 

you. So that would have all those features. 

Now, if it was, of course, voluntary, it 

would solve the -- the two problems that -- that the 

State talks about because if you have a voluntary 

public funding system -- and this is, again, why remand 

is -- is inappropriate. You don't need to go back and

-- and determine whether or not the legislature 

considered providing adequate public funds. I mean, 

it's whether that alternative exists. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But on -- on your view, if 

-- if there were a -- a mandatory publicly funded 

scheme and the -- the limits on expenditure were very 

high -- it was a very generous scheme. They gave them 

lots of money -- it would still be unconstitutional 

because there would be -- I -- I take it on your view, 

because there would be an elimination of any way to 

participate by contributing. Is that correct? 

MR. BOPP: There would be an absolute 

prohibition, and this Court in -- in Beaumont reserved 

that question of whether or not an absolute prohibition 

-- and -- and then in McConnell, you struck down the 

absolute prohibition on minors' contributing to 

campaigns. So, yes, there would be a absolute 

prohibition on any way for any individual to associate 

with a campaign through a contribution. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, it would also prevent 

the candidate himself from expending his entire 

fortune, if he wishes, in informing people of why he 

should be elected --

MR. BOPP: Yes, that is true. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- think that's okay.

 MR. BOPP: And -- and in the record below, 

plaintiff Donald Brunelle said that he was prepared to 

spend considerable sums in support of his State Senate 

election, which -- and considerable sums above the 

expenditure limits that were before -- that were 

adopted by Vermont. So the -- the question is an 

independent --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which raises no possibility 

of corruption. 

MR. BOPP: Well, nor -- nor on fund raising 

using up your time because all a wealthy person has to 

do is write a check. And -- and, of course, in 

Vermont, they even have an exception for not only just 

the wealthy -- wealthy candidate, but the wealthy 

family. So, you know --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know what you mean 

they have an exception for the wealthy family. 

MR. BOPP: Yes. To a third degree of 

consanguinity, people who are related to you to that 

degree are not subject to the contribution limit. So, 

you know, it's hard to justify Vermont's scheme if 

you're concerned about the influence of the wealthy 

because they're giving the wealthy carte blanche to 

fund their own campaigns, even under these limits. So 

a wealthy person who runs for Governor -- he has no

fund raising costs. So -- and -- and he can get 

contributions from others that are related by blood, 

but not by marriage, interestingly, to -- to him. So 

the public funding or the expenditures by -- by the 

wealthy neither give rise to -- and both solve --

either don't give rise or solve the problems that they 

claim. 

So there's -- there's -- you don't need a 

remand to consider that -- that question, and that is 

one of the questions that the Second Circuit has asked 

that -- that the matter be remanded for. 

Now, in addition, the expenditure and 

contribution limits here are not going to allow even 

effective campaigns. We have considerable evidence in 

the record that to run an effective campaign for 

Governor in Vermont, it takes $600,000 to $800,000; for 

the Senate --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Bopp, may I ask you? 

You keep -- the way you're discussing this case, one 

would think that the trial court found there was an 

evidentiary insufficiency, but I thought, at least on 

the contributions part, the trial court found that the 

evidence sufficed to justify those limits. 

MR. BOPP: They did, but erroneously, and I

independent examination of the record. For instance, 

there was a finding by the district court that these 

amounts were, quote, suspiciously large. Now, if you 

look at the record and you look at the six individuals 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. What -- what 

amounts were suspiciously large? 

MR. BOPP: The contribution limits -- amounts 

over the contribution limits for --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can you -- can you point 

to the place in the district court opinion that you're 

referring to? 

MR. BOPP: I am sorry. I do not have that in 

front of me. That the district court found that the 

amounts prohibited under the contribution limits by 

Vermont were, quote, suspiciously large, and then they 

cited six different witnesses. We have reviewed each 

-- in our reply, each one of those witnesses, and it is 

simply not true that any of them said that it was 

suspiciously large, that is, that if there was any 

relationship between contributions between the old 

limits of $1,000 per election and these new, much --

much lower limits, if there was any -- any witness 

related contributions of that size to any threat of 

corruption. In fact, in the examples that are given,

they disclaim that there was any -- that anybody was

that were made. 

Now, the -- in terms of an effective 

campaign, of course, under Shrink if a expenditure --

if a contribution limit amounts to an expenditure limit 

-- and the Court commented on this. This Court 

commented on this in -- in Citizens Against Rent 

Control v. Berkeley. If a contribution limit acts as 

an expenditure limit, then it can -- it will be also be 

struck down if the candidates cannot mount effective 

campaigns. 

And here we have demonstrated in the record 

what an effective campaign amounts to, and the amounts 

even for the House district of $2,000 would be simply 

used up by 1 brochure, 100 yard signs, and 1 postcard 

mailing. All of these have been valued in the record, 

and that would amount to $1,500 to $2,000, almost the 

entire amount allowed, not allowing even one mailing to 

all voters in -- in that House district. 

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

 MR. SORRELL: Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, 

and may it please the Court: 

Justice Kennedy, you raised the issue of 

whether money buys access. It clearly does. Our 

Governor admitted that in a State of the State address. 

But we also had testimony at trial from a former 

statewide officeholder that money, of course, buys 

access, but on the bad days, it buys influence. And we 

had the President --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --

MR. SORRELL: -- of the Senate --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you -- you 

say in your brief -- I'm reading from page 13 -- that 

the record convincingly shows that the ties among donor 

groups and elected officials often determine the 

positions officials take. Can you give me an example 

of an official who took a position because of the ties 

to donor groups? 

MR. SORRELL: The -- there was testimony that 

the President of the Senate said to another Senator who 

was testifying at trial, we've lost the drug money. 

I'm not willing to lose the food manufacturer money, so 

I'm not going to sign this bill. That same President 

of the Senate testified in a legislative hearing -- I 

-- he admitted that he makes decisions in performing

his legislative duties because of that whole lot of 

money that he had collected in the year before. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your position is 

that that official's official positions were determined 

by the donor groups, as you say in your brief. 

MR. SORRELL: Influenced and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your brief says 

determined. And did -- did you --

MR. SORRELL: Have an influence and we would 

suggest an undue influence in some cases. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it should say 

influenced rather than determined. 

MR. SORRELL: We didn't have anyone, as 

Justice Scalia asked, who stood up and admitted to 

having taken bribes. We did have the Senator, who was 

the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, who said 

that she's not in favor of tax credits, but she had a 

donor to her campaign who had given $500 in one 

campaign cycle and $1,000 in another cycle, and she 

allowed a tax credit to go through her taxing 

committee, even though substantively she didn't like 

tax credits. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How many prosecutions 

for political corruption have you brought? 

MR. SORRELL: We have not had any of

legislators or statewide officers that I'm aware of. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think that 

political corruption in Vermont is a serious problem? 

MR. SORRELL: It is a serious problem. Over 

70 percent of Vermonters at -- there was testimony at 

trial from an expert that over 70 percent of Vermonters 

believed that corporate interests and wealthy 

individuals have an undue influence on politics in the 

State, and I think 73 percent believe that the average 

citizen --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would you describe 

your State as a clean State politically or as a corrupt 

one? 

MR. SORRELL: We have a real problem in 

Vermont. We haven't had a Governor go to prison. We 

haven't had legislators tearfully apologizing for 

having taken bribes, facing an indictment the next day. 

But we have got a problem in Vermont. In over 65 

hearings before our legislature and then through a 10-

day trial, we established that as the trial court said, 

the threat of corruption in Vermont is far from 

illusory. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: To the extent that Vermont 

legislators can be bought off by $51?

don't suggest that.

 The reality is that these contribution limits 

that we had -- we had examples under the old 

contribution limits. Even Petitioner Randall admitted 

that in Vermont, a $1,000 contribution -- if you 

receive a $1,000 contribution in Vermont -- this is one 

of the petitioners -- then Vermonters think that you've 

been bought. And that's the reality --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And they can -- and 

presumably they act accordingly at the polls. If they 

think someone has been bought, I assume they don't 

reelect the person. 

MR. SORRELL: The Buckley court thought that 

disclosure obligations and contribution limits alone 

would be -- would suffice to address corruption and --

JUSTICE BREYER: But I have the same question 

Justice Scalia had. I mean, the -- the question is you 

-- you have limits here of $100 per election. It's 

$200 per cycle. 

MR. SORRELL: For a House race, yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: For a House. $300 for the 

Senate, $400 for a candidate for statewide office, 

including the Governor. That's $200 for an election 

for Governor. You throw in contributions in kind. You 

say that the political parties themselves cannot give 

more than that $200 for an election for the Governor.

If we translated those into 1974 dollars, they're just 

the numbers Justice Scalia mentioned, and I would like 

to know why are they -- why does not give incumbents a 

tremendous advantage, that if you have the incumbent 

plus a newspaper, it's hopeless, that there's no way of 

spending as a challenger. In other words, why aren't 

these limits far too low? 

MR. SORRELL: Incumbents had a much more of 

an advantage in the pre-Act 64 world. They could raise 

more money and spend more money than --

JUSTICE BREYER: It's not going to help to 

say incumbents had a bigger advantage before. That is, 

the question is, what we're interested in is -- at 

least what I've written that I'm interested in, is at 

what point do these become so low that they really, as 

a significant matter, shut off the possibility of a 

challenge. And from that point of view, your numbers, 

which do not tell me the expenditures in a competitive 

district, and your numbers, which do not explain all 

the problems that Judge Winter had with these things, 

do not help. That's why I'm asking you the question. 

MR. SORRELL: Vermont has the --

JUSTICE BREYER: I want your answer. 

MR. SORRELL: Vermont has the second lowest 

gubernatorial spending in the country. In the record

it shows that in the largest urban area in the State, 

in the Burlington area, you can buy three 30-second TV 

ads in prime time on tier one cable for $45. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm not talking about the 

expenditure. I'm talking about the contribution 

limits. I and my friends have the following thought. 

We don't know who the candidates for State rep are, but 

we want a Republican slate or we want a Democratic 

slate. So we get all our $5 together, give them to the 

Democratic Party or the Republican Party in Vermont, 

and lo and behold, that party cannot give more than 

$100 in an election to a State rep, et cetera. 

Now, to the -- to the ear, that sounds as if 

a challenger or a slate of challengers or a party that 

wants to challenge is going to have a really tough 

time. So I want you to explain it. 

MR. SORRELL: The extensive record below 

shows that with these contribution limits, attacking 

the corruption and the appearance of corruption issue, 

the candidates can amass the resources necessary to run 

effective campaigns at all levels. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It shows that on average. 

It doesn't show that in the competitive races, which is 

where the -- where the shoe pinches. 

MR. SORRELL: The -- the reality is that --

that in virtually all classes of races, other than the 

single-member Senate races, that average spending was 

below these expenditure limits, and these include 

contested cases with primaries, without. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's just what I said. 

Your figures show that the average spending is below, 

but that's not what's significant. What's significant 

is what Justice Breyer posed, where -- where there is a 

contested race and -- and some new candidate wants to 

unseat somebody who's been in there for years. That's 

-- that's where the shoe pinches. 

MR. SORRELL: And, Justice Scalia, under our 

law, the challenger can spend more than the incumbent 

because the incumbent has a lid not -- of 85 percent or 

90 percent of the expenditure limit, depending on 

whether it's a legislative race or a -- or a statewide 

race. But the -- the issue here is you're going to 

have some -- some outliers. 

But we have core constitutional interests in 

trying to enhance the integrity of our campaigns. We 

have this problem. The legislature reached a balance 

here. It looked at what -- how much you would need to 

run effective campaigns. It set --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But in -- in any -- or in

process of the campaign, and there are historical 

events, national events that suddenly occur that people 

want to comment on. And I -- I just don't see that 

there's any capacity for adjusting so that the public 

can know how candidates are facing issues that are 

beginning to emerge that the public has a vital 

interest in. 

My understanding was that a quarter-page ad 

in the Burlington newspaper was, I think, $1,400. Now, 

it's -- it's gratifying to know that Vermonters are 

splurging on cable television, but it -- it --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- it seems to me that this 

is a highly restrictive rule insofar as having the 

campaign be able to address the issues that the voters 

say that they've become interested in. 

MR. SORRELL: We have the second lowest --

smallest legislative districts in the country, 4,000 

citizens per single-member legislative district. 

Sure, that's what it costs to take out an ad 

in the Free Press, but there's nothing in the record to 

show that House candidates, legislative candidates, 

take out those size ads in -- in the Burlington Free 

Press. The record is otherwise. The record reflects 

that it's primarily door-to-door campaigning for

legislative races. If you're taking out an ad, it's in 

-- it's a flyer in one of the -- the weekly papers. 

Petitioner Donald Brunelle admitted that he ran a 

competitive race for the House, spending $1,000, that 

included yard signs, a mailing to his constituents, and 

flyer advertisements in -- in the newspaper. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Did he have a primary? 

MR. SORRELL: I don't know whether he had a 

primary or not. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: That's another feature of --

of this scheme that I find quite puzzling. You get the 

same expenditure limit for the election cycle whether 

you go through a primary or not. What an advantage 

that is for the incumbent. 

MR. SORRELL: The -- there was testimony in 

the record that those who have a primary might actually 

get a bump over others who are not challenged. 

But as the district court pointed out, in 

Vermont what makes Vermont different is that our 

primary is late. It's the second Tuesday in September, 

and so it's less than 8 weeks from the general 

election. It's not like having a primary in the 

spring. 

And as the legislature during those 65 

hearings considered the campaigning, they considered

all kinds of campaigns, including contested primaries 

and not, and again, average spending in these campaigns 

was, with minor exception of the single-member Senate 

districts, of which there are three -- that average 

spending was below these expenditure limits. So in the 

average campaign, you could actually spend more than --

than on average is being spent. 

And the issue, when you've got competing 

constitutional interests, is whether we address our 

problems of corruption, appearance of corruption. We 

try to free up candidates' and public officials' time 

from fund raising. We try to create competitive 

elections and bring more citizens into the process 

voting, grassroots campaigning, and standing for 

election. We want more people to run. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Sorrell, would you go 

back to the -- your comment on -- on average 

expenditures? Do we know from the record how many of 

the -- how many of the contests, on the basis of which 

the average was calculated, were contests in which 

there was a -- a contested primary? 

MR. SORRELL: We don't have that evidence in 

the record. What we have is that we -- the experts 

looked at total spending, which would include primary 

spending and general election spending, and our figures

went from that. And our expert, by the way, considered 

all races, even those for which campaign finance 

reports were not filed, meaning that the candidate 

hadn't raised or expended more than $500, and assumed 

$500 in spending in each one of those -- each one of 

those races. So our average spending figures actually 

might be a little higher than -- than reality. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was there any testimony or 

evidence on the other side of the point that Judge 

Winter makes? That is, you have someone running in a 

primary and then faces an incumbent in the general 

election, but there's nothing left in the till because 

it was a hard-fought primary. That -- the advantage to 

the incumbent in that situation was a large concern to 

at least some of the judges on the Second Circuit. 

MR. SORRELL: And that might be an issue that 

on remand -- and this case is being remanded on a 

couple of issues that aren't even before this Court. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not on the contributions, 

is it? 

MR. SORRELL: No, it's not on the 

contributions, but it is going back to the court on 

issues of transfers of money from national parties to 

State parties and on whether related or coordinated 

expenditures are, indeed, allowed to be an expenditure.

 So the case is going back to the trial court on those 

bases anyway. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's not going back on 

the expenditure limit. 

MR. SORRELL: I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, the problem, I mean, 

I was getting at and Justice Ginsburg is getting at, 

Judge Winter got at it. The -- the problem is -- is 

the -- the total limitation on an election cycle, 

including the primary, when the primary involves a 

challenge so that the challenger has an uphill fight 

presumably to start with in the primary. And if he's 

going to maintain an effective uphill fight in the 

primary and he's lucky enough to win, he's going to get 

to the general election and he's going to be broke. 

That's -- I mean, that's -- that's the problem that 

we're concerned with. 

MR. SORRELL: That has not been a problem 

that was reflected in the record either before the 

legislature or at trial. This is a facial challenge 

for the law, and you know, that situation of a primary 

candidate who, for whatever reason, felt that he or she 

needed to expend up to close to the expenditure limit 

-- it wouldn't be very prudent, but that could be an 

issue.

 But, you know, we do not control independent 

expenditures under our law, and we certainly don't 

limit volunteer services. There's a tremendous amount 

of campaigning that can go on between a primary and a 

general election even with a limited amount of funds 

available. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: If the burden is on the 

candidate to establish that -- that somebody's 

expenditure is independent and shouldn't be counted 

against his expenditure limit. 

MR. SORRELL: No. There is a presumption 

under our law --

JUSTICE SCALIA: A presumption, which means 

the burden, to go forward and show the opposite, is on 

him. Right? 

MR. SORRELL: Well, but it could be on the --

on the party because --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the money that he spends 

in overcoming that presumption is charged against his 

expenditure. Isn't that right? 

MR. SORRELL: No, Justice Scalia. The 

Secretary of State reached a -- issued an opinion that 

we -- our office agrees with, that expenditures on 

attorneys for, you know, ballot access questions and 

the like are not in furtherance of the candidacy and

would not apply against the expenditure --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The other side says the 

opposite. I'll ask them whether that's --

MR. SORRELL: But the -- the Secretary of 

State's public opinion that we, the enforcement 

authority, agree with is to the contrary. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: May -- may I ask --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I suppose the Vermont 

courts could construe it more narrowly at some later 

point. I would hate to rest the opinion on that. 

MR. SORRELL: The -- the -- under Vermont 

law, a presumption such -- such as this is not a burden 

-- creates no burden of persuasion, nor does it change 

the burden of proof. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you know, I looked at 

your -- the -- the references in your brief for that 

proposition, and I did not see them borne out. You 

referred to a -- a footnote in the district court 

opinion which, in turn, refers to the remark of a 

sponsor of the amendment that -- that resulted in the 

presumption being in the law. And the only thing that 

was attributed to the sponsor was that the presumption 

should be regarded as rebuttable. The -- the footnote 

in the statement did not indicate that the presumption 

was a disappearing presumption, once the other side

went forward with any evidence. So I don't see, based 

on your -- your citations, that the presumption goes 

away simply by -- by one party going forward with 

evidence. 

MR. SORRELL: Well, if you -- if some entity 

that has the burden of proof to show, in fact, that it 

was a related or coordinated expenditure has the party 

on the one hand and the candidate on the other saying, 

we did not coordinate here, I didn't ask for it, I 

didn't approve it, and then where is the evidence? 

JUSTICE SOUTER: The -- the point is what if 

we don't have that simple of a situation. 

Let -- let me ask you this. Maybe we can 

short-circuit this. I mean, do you represent as an --

as a statement of Vermont law that this Court should 

decide the case on the assumption that the presumption 

is a disappearing presumption, once evidence is offered 

against it? 

MR. SORRELL: Yes. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. SORRELL: Well, credible evidence, yes. 

Yes. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is -- is an affidavit 

from the candidate enough credible evidence in your 

view?

typically be a opposing candidate who tries to --

or the State.

there's room under our system for a courageous State to 

experiment.

Burlington and Montpelier, and I buy the gas, does that 

count against the limit? Yes or no. I'm a volunteer 

and I buy gas and drive him back and forth. 

MR. SORRELL: Yes, you drive. Then the 

answer is no.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRENDA WRIGHT 

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 

VERMONT PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP 

MS. WRIGHT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

I'd like to return to a question that Justice 

Kennedy asked earlier about why, if there are examples 

of corruption that the public becomes aware of, why the 

public doesn't respond simply by voting the individual 

out of office. And I think it's important to point out 

that some of the most serious examples of corruption on 

this record or of the undue influence achieved by 

monetary concerns were not examples that ever became 

public except in the course of the trial of this case 

when we had witnesses come forward to testify about 

some of their own personal experiences in the 

legislature. By the very nature of the problem of 

candidates becoming unduly beholden to the interests 

that can provide the greatest sums for their campaigns, 

those kinds of incidents are not going to typically be

a matter of discussion --

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but I -- I thought that 

the point was that the public mistrusts their 

representatives because of large donations, and I 

thought the point being made was, well, if that's the 

case and the public sees that this fellow has gotten a 

$10,000 donation, the public will say this -- this 

fellow is in that -- is in that corporation's or that 

person's pocket. 

MS. WRIGHT: But the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And I won't vote for that 

person. You -- you don't have to show that -- out of 

the mouth of the candidate, that -- that he voted for 

the bill because he got $10,000. The mere fact that 

it's on the public record that he got $10,000, if -- if 

what you say is correct, that -- that people are 

worried about, the -- the corruptive effect of such 

donations, people should logically vote against that 

candidate who accepts so much money. 

MS. WRIGHT: Two points on that, Your Honor. 

First of all, the problem of holding candidates 

accountable in that manner is greatly exacerbated when 

you have a system of unlimited spending in which all of 

the candidates involved feel compelled to go out and 

raise as much as they can in order to forestall the

possibility of being outspent. Then when a voter says, 

well, why are you doing this, the candidate has a 

ready-made answer. If I don't do this -- you know, 

maybe I'd rather not, but if I don't, I'm going to be 

bested in the fund-raising arms race. And voters 

reluctantly have come to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But I thought --

MS. WRIGHT: -- understand that that's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- when you look at 

the -- the record, Vermont would be the last place that 

you'd be worried about it. The political culture, as 

we just heard, is that it's easy to go door to door, 

and that's what the Vermonters expect. And it doesn't 

take an arms race to get on your feet and go door to 

door. And it seems to me that there's a real dilemma 

on the respondents' side of the case between justifying 

low limits by saying you don't really need money to run 

effectively and at the same time suggesting that 

there's a serious problem with too much money. 

MS. WRIGHT: Well, but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Which is it? 

MS. WRIGHT: -- what we do have is candidates 

-- even though it is possible to run effective 

campaigns in Vermont for lower amounts, candidates 

nevertheless go out and raise often much more than what

they need. Here's an example from the record. We had 

Senate candidate Vincent Illuzzi. In 1998, he raised 

$39,000, almost $40,000, for his Senate campaign. His 

challenger was able to raise almost nothing. He only 

spent $30,000 worth of that. Candidates don't need 

$39,000 or $30,000 to run an effective Senate campaign, 

but an incumbent that builds a war chest has the 

ability to deter serious challenges. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Could candidates --

JUSTICE BREYER: On your question -- the --

I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Could candidates run 

effective campaigns if there were no -- with these 

contribution limits if there were no expenditure 

limits? 

MS. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor. The -- we 

believe the record strongly shows that. For example, 

there was a mayoral election in Burlington run under 

these limits during the time that the case was --

JUSTICE ALITO: No. I mean, if there were no 

expenditure limits, if candidates could expend as much 

as they want, could they raise enough money with these 

contribution limits --

MS. WRIGHT: Yes.

campaigns. 

MS. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor, because this 

Burlington mayor's race, as an example, was one in 

which there was no limit on -- on spending, and both 

candidates were able to raise amounts either similar to 

what they had raised in the past or at least amounts 

that met the campaign budget that they had sought to --

to follow. 

I think in looking at the level of the 

contribution limits, it's important again to understand 

the scale of politics in Vermont. If we want to 

compare them to Missouri, a $2,000 limit for a 

gubernatorial race in Missouri was approved by this 

Court, and in Missouri you had an election in 2000 

where each candidate was spending $8 million or $9 

million in a gubernatorial race. I mean, that compares 

very directly if you --

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought the --

MS. WRIGHT: -- did the same ratio for 

Vermont. Pardon me? 

JUSTICE BREYER: Wasn't it the State auditor? 

MS. WRIGHT: Not the $8 million or $9 

million.

have in front of us a limit, which I wrote was rather

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought so, in Shrink 

Missouri. 

MS. WRIGHT: It may have been the State 

auditor, but it also the --

JUSTICE BREYER: Which is not quite the same 

political volatility perhaps, but --

MS. WRIGHT: No, but the --

JUSTICE BREYER: I have a different question 

I'd like to ask you which I haven't heard addressed 

yet. On the expenditure limits, there is a case, 

Buckley v. Valeo, and the Court held in that case that 

expenditure limits are not constitutional. Now, 

whether I agree with that or don't agree with that, am 

I not bound by that? 

And insofar as you try to distinguish it, 

you've read what Judge Winter said about your efforts 

to distinguish it. And therefore, I'd like to hear why 

you think I'm not bound by a past precedent in an 

important matter, with which I may or may not have 

agreed at the time. 

MS. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor. We believe 

expenditure limits can be upheld without overruling 

Buckley v. Valeo, and that's for several reasons.

 First, Buckley created a rule of exacting 

scrutiny that applies to expenditure limits. That is 

not a rule of automatic invalidation. 

And very importantly, when Buckley declared 

that the interest in deterring corruption and its 

appearance was not adequate to support the expenditure 

limits, that was on a record in which neither spending 

nor contributions had been subject to meaningful limits 

prior to the time of FECA and the amendments that the 

Court was considering. There simply was no record to 

show the Court of how contribution limits alone would 

really work to address the problem of corruption and 

the appearance of -- of corruption and encouraging 

public confidence in government. Now --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I thought -- I thought what 

that case said and what many of our other cases say, 

with regard to expenditures in particular, is that 

you're not talking about money here. You're talking 

about speech. So long as all that money is going to 

campaigning, you're talking about speech. 

And when you say you don't need any more 

speech than this, that's a very odd thing for -- for a 

-- a United States Government to say. Enough speech. 

You don't need any more than this. And that's the 

reason the expenditure limits, as opposed to

contribution limits, were regarded quite differently in 

Buckley and I think should still be regarded 

differently today. You're constraining speech. It's 

not money you're constraining. Contribution limits, 

you're constraining money, but when you say you can't 

expend more than this on your campaign, you're saying, 

no, no, no, this is enough speech. We're going to --

we, the State, are going to tell you how much you 

should campaign. That's very unusual in -- in American 

democracy. 

MS. WRIGHT: Your Honor, I think that's 

certainly why Buckley applied exacting scrutiny. But I 

think what Vermont understood is that political 

spending has inescapably a dual character. Yes, 

campaign spending enables many forms of speech, but it 

also has another side because higher and higher levels 

of campaign spending result in candidates who are 

beholden to the constituencies that can provide the 

greatest amounts of funds for their campaigns. And 

what you end up with, the consequence, is legislators 

who say, you know, I've lost the drug money and I can't 

afford to lose the food manufacturer money --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Limit the contributions. 

MS. WRIGHT: -- so I'm not going to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That solves that problem.

Limit the contributions. 

MS. WRIGHT: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you want to limit 

expenditures, even if it's the person's own money. No 

possibility of corruption. You're saying, no, this is 

enough speech. We don't want to hear any more from 

you. We, the State, will tell you how much campaigning 

is enough. That's extraordinary. 

MS. WRIGHT: Because the -- the interests 

that Vermont is seeking to serve are fundamental to the 

core functions of government, preserving the quality of 

representative government, preserving the integrity of 

government, assuring the public that its officeholders 

can act in the best interests of the public and make 

decisions on the merits, not simply based on their need 

for campaign cash. 

And this question of accountability that's so 

important is tied to the ability to say, I've -- I've 

met my spending limits, I've raised all that I need to 

-- to raise. If somebody comes to me with 

contributions from a source that I don't feel 

comfortable taking, I can turn that down without 

suffering a tremendous competitive disadvantage. 

I think one of the other key features of the 

expenditure limits that Vermont seeks to impose here is

that they will do so much to encourage competitive 

campaigns. We had a record in Vermont that showed that 

for the previous nine election cycles before the act 

was enacted, only one incumbent had been defeated for a 

statewide office. In the meantime, in the City of 

Albuquerque where they had spending limits for 25 

years, every challenger who came out to challenge an 

incumbent mayor was successful. No one can say on that 

record that spending limits would do anything but to 

enhance competition. 

In the -- one of the other interests that I 

would like to turn to, before we close, is Vermont's 

interest in protecting the time of officeholders from 

the burdens and distractions of fund raising. We had a 

record in which seasoned politicians in Vermont were 

saying that candidates for office, even in Vermont, 

were spending as much time begging for funds as they do 

campaigning. We had a record in which a Senator 

reported leaving the floor of the Senate during a floor 

debate to take a call from a donor. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do you -- how do 

you police that, though? Because an incumbent can --

has so many opportunities to go before the public that 

wouldn't necessarily be categorized as campaigning but 

as part of his or her official duties, while everything

a challenger does is going to be credited against his 

account. 

MS. WRIGHT: Well, Your --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You may answer the 

question. 

MS. WRIGHT: Yes, Your Honor. 

We believe that under almost any system, 

incumbents are going to still have advantages and no 

campaign finance system can fully address that. But we 

believe that if the challenger now has the ability to 

outspend the incumbent and the incumbent doesn't have 

that additional advantage of being able to outspend the 

challenger, as is most often the case, then competition 

can only be enhanced. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Bopp, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR. 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

IN NOS. 04-1528 AND 04-1530 

MR. BOPP: Thank you. 

The one example that they keep going back to 

regarding the President of the Senate tells the breadth 

of this challenge. As long as Vermont allows periodic 

elections, incumbents are going to consider the effect 

that their votes have on future elections. And -- and

while it makes it more scandalous to say we will lose 

the food manufacturers' money, what they are concerned 

about is losing the food manufacturers' support. So as 

-- if this the definition of corruption, it is 

sufficient now to -- for the State of Vermont to 

abolish elections generally. 

Now, secondly, as to the effect on 

challengers, the record demonstrates that challengers 

-- and there's expert testimony to the fact that 

challengers are more frequently challenged in primaries 

than are incumbents, and the Randall brief on pages 16 

and 17 point out the testimony of people who have been 

subject to a primary and demonstrates that they are not 

able to mount an effective campaign in the general. 

Furthermore, the expenditure limits have the 

perverse result of depriving challengers of more money 

than incumbents, probably making them attractive to 

incumbents. In the Senate, for instance, incumbents 

would be deprived of 20 percent of their total 

resources, while challengers would be deprived of 36 

percent of their total resources. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand how that 

comes. How does that come about? 

MR. BOPP: It comes about because challengers 

frequently in Vermont actually spend more than do

incumbents. I -- I know that -- that the general 

perception is the opposite, but the general perception 

is not true in Vermont. And -- and that points to the 

-- the fact that the way this law is constructed 

strongly suggests that is -- it is seeking to favor 

incumbents. 

Furthermore, we had expert witness testimony 

on the effect of contribution limits on competitive 

races. The -- we had -- Mr. McNeil testified in 

examining the competitive races in the 1998 election 

that the vast majority in both the House and the Senate 

would not be able to mount an effective campaign with 

the available resources that would have been available 

after imposing the contribution limits. And, of 

course, these were in the amounts of 28 percent in the 

Senate, 22 percent in the House, which is way beyond 

the 5.1 percent that this Court in Buckley thought that 

could be made up by the imposition of a $1,000 limit. 

I mean, this -- this law is so constructed 

that it would make it virtually impossible for, for 

instance, countywide candidates in Chittenden County, a 

county of 150,000, the largest county in Vermont --

they would be limited to $4,000 for the primary and the 

general election. That's 3 cents for each person in 

Chittenden County. And, of course, this is an

important county. Senator Leahy came from that county 

as State's attorney and became the United States 

Senator. 

And finally, with respect to the rebuttable 

presumption, actually the -- the statute answers the 

question of whether or not this presumption disappears. 

If you look at 2809, subsection (e), the last sentence 

says, the findings and determination of the court --

and this is in this court proceeding by your opponent 

that is trying to claim that this spending over here is 

actually yours -- that the findings and the 

determination of the court shall be prima facie 

evidence in any proceeding brought for violation of the 

chapter. So it doesn't go away. The rebuttable 

presumption never goes away. And, in fact, each person 

-- each candidate and each independent spender can look 

at the rebuttable presumption requirement and say, I 

have to file a report and that governs my report. 

Thank you. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

(Whereupon, at 11:12 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
