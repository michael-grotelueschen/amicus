3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 10-1016, Coleman v. The Court 

of Appeals of Maryland. 

6  Mr. Foreman. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. FOREMAN 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. FOREMAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

11  The propriety of any section 5 legislation 

12 is judged by in reference to the historical perspective 

13 that it reflects, and that historical perspective is 

14 very clear in -- and it's set very clearly by Congress 

and by this Court. It -- it is an unfortunate, long 

16 history of State-sponsored gender discrimination. And 

17 those -- that discrimination embodies gender-based 

18 stereotypes that took a very firm hold in the employment 

19 area, where women had difficulty obtaining employment 

and holding employment. And this Court in a litany of 

21 cases recognized these gender-based stereotypes as -- as 

22 an improper assumption about women's abilities. 

23  In Frontiero v. Richardson, it rejected this 

24 issue that women's mission were to be women -- to be 

wives and mothers; Stanton v. Stanton, that women were 

3

1 to be the homemaker and men the breadwinner, and --

2  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Foreman, I guess 

3 the question in this case is what this particular 

4 statutory provision has to do with gender discrimination 

and the history of gender discrimination, whether 

6 Congress was aiming to eradicate gender discrimination 

7 through this provision or whether it was trying to do 

8 something else entirely. 

9  MR. FOREMAN: And it was directly attempting 

to address these gender-based stereotypes in a couple 

11 different ways as a practical matter. At that time, 

12 when an employer saw a woman, they didn't necessarily 

13 just see a worker. They saw a person that could become 

14 pregnant, and worked on these gender-based stereotypes, 

that that woman would either become pregnant, would be 

16 disabled because of pregnancy-related disabilities but, 

17 in any event, was a least -- least attractive employee. 

18  And the Family and Medical Leave Act 

19 addresses that specifically in its purposes section. It 

specifically says that is intended to promote the equal 

21 opportunity for women and men pursuant to the Equal 

22 Protection Clause. 

23  But more specific to the self-care 

24 provision, Congress made it very clear what they were 

attempting to do. If you move to the "findings"

Official 

1 section, first, in finding number 6, they address --

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where -- where are 

3 you reading from, counsel? 

4  MR. FOREMAN: I am reading from Appendix A 

to the brief, and it is -- that employment standards 

6 that apply to one gender only have a serious potential 

7 for encouraging employers to discriminate against 

8 employees and applicants of employment who are of that 

9 gender.

 That's the negative inference argument that 

11 we make in our brief. But even more to the point, if 

12 you move to the purpose sections at appendix 2, 

13 page appendix 2, it specifically is intended to minimize 

14 the potential for employment discrimination on the basis 

of sex by ensuring generally that leave is available for 

16 eligible medical reasons, including maternity-related 

17 disabilities and for compelling family reasons, and to 

18 ensure equal protection under the law. 

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, following up on 

Justice Kagan's question, I have -- I have difficulty 

21 seeing how providing 12 weeks of leave for self-care for 

22 both men and women affects the incentive of an employer 

23 who we will assume has an inclination to discriminate 

24 against women based on the possibility that a woman 

applicant for employment may become pregnant. I just

1 don't see how that would affect the incentives of -- of 

2 an employer in that situation. 

3  MR. FOREMAN: The rationale of Congress at 

4 that point was that they could have addressed this issue 

several different ways. They -- and they passed (A), 

6 (B), and (C) -- the birth of the child, the adoption of 

7 the child, and the Family and Medical Leave Act --

8 against -- again, addressing gender-based stereotypes. 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, (A) is not at issue, 

right? 

11  Okay. So, we're just dealing with (D), 

12 which concerns a serious health condition. So, you have 

13 an employer who is willing to discriminate on the basis 

14 of gender. The employer has two applicants for 

employment, a man and a woman, and the employer says, 

16 well, if I hire the man, he might take 12 weeks of leave 

17 for a serious medical condition, and if I hire the 

18 woman, she might take 12 weeks of leave for a serious 

19 medical condition which might be something that either 

men or women could get, or it also could be a sickness 

21 related to pregnancy. 

22  So, there still is -- there still would be 

23 an incentive for this hypothetical employer to 

24 discriminate against the woman.

 MR. FOREMAN: But one of the things Congress 

6

5

25

Official 

1 tried to do is to take that incentive away. 

2  JUSTICE ALITO: How does it do that? That's 

3 what I'm -- I understand that, and it's a worthy 

4 objective. I just don't understand how giving both men 

and women 12 weeks of leave for self-care affects the 

6 incentive. 

7  MR. FOREMAN: It affects the incentive by 

8 providing -- it becomes the equal opportunity employer. 

9 It evens the -- the ground. And the way it would do it 

is an employer, if you just have (A) through (C), can 

11 look at an employee and, based upon gender stereotypes, 

12 would make the assumption that the women, because of 

13 historically the role they were required to play, would 

14 be taking all the leave under (A) and (B) and (C). And 

so, why would I even hire that woman in the first place? 

16  JUSTICE KAGAN: But women don't get sick 

17 less often than men, do they? 

18  MR. FOREMAN: No, absolutely. 

19  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, you're just adding 

something to both sides of the balance, and it doesn't 

21 affect the employer's incentive. The employer still --

22 the -- the hypothetical discriminatory employer would 

23 still say, well, women are going to be caregivers more 

24 often; so, I'm -- I'm going to not hire that person.

 MR. FOREMAN: But under (A), (B), and (C) 

7

Official 

1 after the Family and Medical Leave, an employer would 

2 look and say both men can take these now. And I think 

3 we need to step back --

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: And that's why (A), (B), and 

(C) go to the problem, but what does (D) have to do with 

6 it? If you assume that both men and women get sick at 

7 an approximately equal rate -- maybe you don't assume 

8 that -- but if you do, it doesn't seem to factor into 

9 the employer's incentives in any way.

 MR. FOREMAN: There is nothing in the record 

11 that demonstrates that there's a differential rate 

12 between the self-care rates for men and women. But the 

13 perception was that women, because of pregnancy, because 

14 of pregnancy-related disabilities, would in fact take 

more leave. And so that I would look at a woman as an 

16 employer and say she will become pregnant, she will take 

17 leave, she will be disabled. However, with (D) now, but 

18 the man can take a -- a disability leave on the same 

19 basis.

 And the hope of Congress was not that it 

21 would happen immediately, but by the -- what would 

22 happen is, with the application of family and medical 

23 leave, at some point men would be taking (A), (B), and 

24 (C), and, in fact, women and men would be taking family 

and medical self-care leave. I just --

Official 

1  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Foreman, I think 

2 everyone has been trying to get you to focus on the 

3 health care sickness leave alone, and in the -- in the 

4 portions of the Act that this Court upheld, the Congress 

said there is this close association of women with 

6 children; we think it's going to be good for everybody 

7 if fathers recognize their responsibility for elderly 

8 parents, sick children, sick spouse. So, we -- we can 

9 see the rationale, trying to change the stereotype, 

trying to open up caregiving for both sexes. 

11  But you have answered the question that 

12 women and men get sick; there's no -- there's no 

13 disproportion. So, how do you tie that, just -- just 

14 that part of the Act, where there -- there isn't the 

obvious association of women with childbearing? So, we 

16 extend the benefit to men so they'll be associated with 

17 child care. There isn't that same link here, is there? 

18  MR. FOREMAN: I think it is the same linkage 

19 trying to address -- it's addressing a difference there, 

but it's addressing the linkage that women will in fact 

21 take pregnancy-based leave or pregnancy-based 

22 disabilities and, therefore, are less attractive, less 

23 -- employees, and that's what self-care was intended to 

24 do.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: So, you're saying -- let me

Official 

1 just make sure I understand. You're saying that the --

2 that Congress is thinking that an employer actually does 

3 think that women take more sick leave because women get 

4 pregnant. And just as Congress was thinking about the 

employer who thought women are going to take more family 

6 leave, you think Congress was thinking about the 

7 employer who thinks women are also going to take more 

8 sick leave because of pregnancy? 

9  MR. FOREMAN: Absolutely, Your Honor. And 

in response to Justice Alito's question -- and I'm sorry 

11 if I gave a confusing response. There are two separate 

12 ways of addressing that. 

13  You can look at self-care as a stand-alone 

14 provision, without (A), (B), and (C). Congress passed 

just self-care. In that case it would be responding to 

16 exactly that type of gender stereotype, and 12 weeks 

17 would be a congruent and proportional response. 

18  The other way to look at it is that's not 

19 the way Congress passed the bill. They passed it as a 

comprehensive response with (A), (B), and (C), and hence 

21 (D) then becomes a bit of an equalizer to take away this 

22 negative incentive that only women would take (A), (B), 

23 and (C). 

24  So, there's two separate ways that this 

Court can get to the same conclusion, and that 

10

25

Official 

1 conclusion is that this is a congruent and proportional 

2 response to gender-based discrimination. 

3  JUSTICE KAGAN: Do you have any evidence 

4 that Congress in fact was thinking about either of these 

two things? Is there anything in the record that 

6 suggests either of those two theories? 

7  MR. FOREMAN: Yes, there -- there is, Your 

8 Honor, and let me -- let me take the negative inference 

9 first, because I think looking at the statute as a 

comprehensive makes sense -- is it was introduced -- and 

11 I'm reading from page 43. It's referenced on page 43 of 

12 our brief, that starting in 1987, National Women's 

13 Political Caucus testified, quote: "My primary purpose 

14 is to stress that parental and medical leave are 

inseparable. In the words of the old song, 'You can't 

16 have one without the other.'" 

17  And the point she then later on to explain 

18 was parental leave without medical leave would encourage 

19 discrimination against women of child-bearing age, who 

constitute approximately 73 percent of all women in the 

21 workforce. Employers would tend to hire men, who are 

22 much less likely to make this claim. 

23  Fast forward to 1993 at the time of the 

24 passage of -- and this would be on page 42 of our merits 

brief: "A law providing special protection to women or 

11

1 any defined group, in addition to being inequitable, 

2 runs the risk of causing discrimination." The FML 

3 addresses this by addressing the needs of all workers, 

4 avoids this risk. The FMLA is based on the guarantees 

of equal protection. So, it addresses that aspect of --

6 it addresses that aspect. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counselor, I -- I take 

8 your argument, but if you look at the legislative 

9 record, the reports, the findings, et cetera, and the 

statements repeatedly by many congresspeople, there 

11 appears to be -- have been a dual motive for this 

12 provision. They were, in fact, engaged in the question 

13 of discrimination against pregnant women. That was 

14 recognized in Hibbs, and that's clear.

 But with respect to this particular 

16 provision, they were also concerned about economic 

17 effect that -- that happened to everyone, men and women, 

18 who became disabled. And so, they appear to have had 

19 dual motivation. Part of the bill was gender-related; 

part of the bill seemed to be disability-related. 

21  What do -- how do we judge that kind of 

22 bill, where Congress may have been expanding the 

23 benefits it's giving to people, not solely because of 

24 gender discrimination, but because of this desire to 

address disability discrimination?

Official 

1  MR. FOREMAN: Justice Sotomayor, I -- I 

2 think the way you judge it is rely on what Congress's 

3 expressed findings and provisions are. And to the 

4 extent this Court makes a determination that the FMLA is 

responsive to gender-based discrimination, then how
 

6 Congress chose to address that is congruent and
 

7 proportional.
 

8  The fact that Congress may also have had
 

9 other motives, that there was a concern with -- with
 

families and that families are -- benefit should not be 

11 used to undermine the fact that Congress indeed was 

12 acting pursuant to one of its broadest powers, section 5 

13 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and, therefore, that their 

14 -- their considered judgment is a congruent and 

proportional response. 

16  Part of -- part of the findings is clearly 

17 reflective of a fact that this covered both governmental 

18 employers and private industry. So, there was reference 

19 to Commerce Clause type of -- of analysis, which my 

colleagues raised repeatedly in their brief. But the 

21 court -- the Congress needed to do that because they 

22 were regulating private employment but, at the same 

23 time, recognized to the extent that we are -- are going 

24 to regulate State-based conduct.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, with respect to the

1 Commerce Clause, could I ask you this: If we were to 

2 disagree with you on the Fourteenth Amendment and hold 

3 that it -- that Congress didn't validly abrogate State 

4 sovereign immunity with respect to subsection (D), would 

your client still be able to seek reinstatement or other 

6 injunctive relief? 

7  MR. FOREMAN: Justice Alito, I think what 

8 you're -- and you'll clearly correct me if I am wrong, 

9 but I think what you are responding to, is there an Ex 

parte Young action here that would be made -- able to be 

11 made consistent with the Commerce Clause, under the 

12 Commerce Clause? 

13  And the answer is -- and I know that both 

14 Justice Kennedy and Justice Rehnquist, I think, in one 

of his dissents, pointed out in the Family and Medical 

16 Leave Act that the employee may not be left out in the 

17 dark because there is an Ex parte Young claim. 

18  A couple points on that --

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Here the district court 

completely dismissed your FMLA claim, not just insofar 

21 as you sought damages. I -- I think you also sought 

22 reinstatement and other equitable relief, but the 

23 district court dismissed it completely. 

24  MR. FOREMAN: That's right.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But you're not contesting 

14

1 that, are you? 

2  MR. FOREMAN: We're not contesting it 

3 consistent with any Ex parte Young claim. What the 

4 district court did was say the claim is totally 

dismissed based upon Eleventh Amendment immunity. 

6  But if I could try to respond to your 

7 question more specifically, this Court has never as a 

8 Court held that Ex parte Young type of action is 

9 available in this type of claim. Assuming that it --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because this is for money 

11 damages. 

12  MR. FOREMAN: Pardon? 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because this is for money 

14 damages. Ex parte Young was just injunctive relief. 

The Eleventh Amendment primarily protects the treasuries 

16 of the State against money damages. 

17  MR. FOREMAN: Correct. 

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: It's not Ex parte Young. 

19  MR. FOREMAN: Correct. But as -- as you 

pointed out in your dissent in Hibbs, that Ex parte 

21 Young may be available, but one of the concerns we have 

22 is, again, that the Court -- as a majority, the Court 

23 has never held that. I believe that is in fact the 

24 correct interpretation of the law, that it would be 

available for injunctive relief. However, the Court has 

15
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 never defined the parameters of what an Ex parte Young 

2 action really gives a plaintiff, and that becomes very 

3 important in this case. 

4  JUSTICE ALITO: You said "in this case." 

That's basically what I'm asking. If we were to 

6 disagree with you on the Fourteenth Amendment, are you 

7 asking us simply -- would we then simply affirm the 

8 Fourth Circuit? Or would we have to -- would we have to 

9 make some accommodation for the possibility that the 

dismissal of your claim, insofar as you sought 

11 injunctive relief, may have been improper? 

12  MR. FOREMAN: I think you would have to make 

13 that accommodation, but, with respect, Your Honor, I 

14 think that would be an incorrect approach. And here's 

-- here's the reason why in Ex parte Young, a perfect 

16 example --

17  JUSTICE ALITO: I am really trying to be a 

18 little bit helpful to you. And I --

19  (Laughter.)

 MR. FOREMAN: And apparently I missed that, 

21 and I apologize. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. 

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: What relief did you ask 

24 for? Damages, we know, and the -- you have to overcome 

the Eleventh Amendment. Injunctive relief, you don't,

1 but did you ask for it? 

2  MR. FOREMAN: In the complaint itself, it 

3 does not ask for injunctive relief pursuant to the 

4 Family and Medical Leave Act.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I thought you --

6  MR. FOREMAN: There were combined claims --

7  JUSTICE ALITO: I thought you did, but maybe 

8 I'm reading your complaint more generously than you read 

9 it yourself.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, you --

11  JUSTICE KAGAN: I'd go with Justice Alito 

12 here. 

13  MR. FOREMAN: If that's your reading of it, 

14 we will certainly accept your reading.

 (Laughter.) 

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: You must have asked for 

17 such other and further relief. 

18  MR. FOREMAN: But, again, back to the Ex 

19 parte Young, in the case Nelson v. The University of 

Tennessee -- Texas, a -- the case that dealt with --

21 exactly with this issue of abrogation of Eleventh 

22 Amendment immunity, and they found that there was valid 

23 abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity, the State of 

24 Texas -- then the court was required to address the Ex 

parte Young issue. And the State of Texas argued that 

17

1 reinstatement is not an appropriate remedy under Ex 

2 parte Young and that -- while the Fifth Circuit 

3 ultimately rejected that, that is an argument that 

4 employees would have to face: What are the parameters 

of Ex parte Young? And, more importantly, that is not 

6 the remedy that Congress in their considered judgment 

7 believed was the appropriate remedy to address 

8 gender-based discrimination. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, Congress must have 

thought that giving the woman back her job was an 

11 important part. I mean, I thought the whole idea is she 

12 wasn't supposed to be fired. So, I think that the --

13 the relief, the non-monetary relief, is certainly 

14 important.

 MR. FOREMAN: It is extremely important, but 

16 Congress did not stop there. Congress decided it needed 

17 to take one step further and there needed to be monetary 

18 relief. And I think Mr. Coleman's case illustrates 

19 exactly why.

 Here Mr. Coleman exercised his rights that 

21 were supposedly guaranteed him under the Family and 

22 Medical Leave Act, and indeed under a State law, and the 

23 State of Maryland fired him, and he is out of work. And 

24 what is the disincentive for the State to not do the 

same thing the next time if the only thing that you can

1 get is possibly injunctive relief prohibiting them from 

2 doing that in the future and maybe reinstatement 2 or 3 

3 years down the line? Employees at that point cannot put 

4 their lives on hold. They have a duty to go out and try 

to mitigate, try to find another job. 

6  What's an employer to do? And Congress said 

7 there needs to be more. We passed Title VII to try to 

8 address gender-based discrimination, the Pregnancy 

9 Discrimination Act, but there were still voids. And the 

Family and Medical Leave Act attempts to fill those 

11 voids, and one of those voids is try to provide a 

12 monetary incentive so that the State of Maryland and 

13 private employers will in fact comply with the law. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you -- when you --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I go -- I'm sorry. 

16  JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say you're 

17 concerned about a disincentive to hire women, but the 

18 Pregnancy Discrimination Act makes that unlawful. So, 

19 if an employer decides I don't want to hire women of 

child-bearing age, that is an out-and-out violation of 

21 the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, isn't it? 

22  MR. FOREMAN: That is, Your Honor, but the 

23 Pregnancy Discrimination Act did not fill the other gap 

24 which the Family and Medical --

1 incentive -- the disincentive to hire women of 

2 child-bearing age. The law protects the woman of child-

3 bearing age by saying, Employer, you can't refuse to 

4 hire her, promote her, and all the rest because of 

pregnancy. 

6  MR. FOREMAN: It -- well, what the Pregnancy 

7 Discrimination Act provided was that you needed to treat 

8 pregnancy-related disabilities as you would other 

9 short-term disabilities. So, if an employer decided not

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm just asking you 

12 about -- your -- your argument rests on an employer 

13 acting unlawfully, you see. He won't hire -- we have to 

14 give them medical leave, to everyone, because otherwise 

the employer won't hire women. And that's -- the 

16 question I'm asking is, you are assuming that the 

17 employer will break the law by refusing to hire women 

18 that -- of child-bearing age? 

19  MR. FOREMAN: I don't want to make that 

assumption in my incentive argument. I was using Mr. 

21 Coleman as an example of why Congress could have made a 

22 determination that monetary relief would be appropriate 

23 in the Family and Medical Leave Act. 

24  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I -- your argument to 

a large extent depends -- or you say Congress did this

1 because they wanted to eliminate or at least reduce one 

2 kind of discrimination against women in the job market. 

3  MR. FOREMAN: Yes. 

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that -- that 

discrimination was refusing to hire women of child-

6 bearing age. Well, they couldn't do it out and out 

7 because that would be a violation of the law. So, is 

8 Congress having in mind discrimination that is under --

9 under the radar screen, that it's going to go on even 

though it's unlawful? 

11  MR. FOREMAN: I -- I don't think that was 

12 Congress's intent, and that that's not what was 

13 reflected. I think, again, they were trying to address 

14 it on two separate levels: one, the gender-based 

discrimination, the gender stereotype that women simply 

16 become less attractive; and in the broader statute, to 

17 prevent the negative inference so that all -- that 

18 ultimately where we would get in society is the ability 

19 to take pregnancy-related leave, other leave, would not 

be viewed as a negative inference running against women, 

21 and, therefore, women ultimately would become a 

22 nonissue. 

23  And I see the light's on. So, if I could 

24 reserve the balance of my time.

2  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN B. HOWARD, JR., 

3  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

4  MR. HOWARD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

6  In order to affirm in this case, the Court 

7 need go no further than to distinguish Hibbs, and we 

8 think Hibbs is readily distinguishable. And I'd like to 

9 highlight four principal --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Need go no further? I'm 

11 sorry. I -- I didn't --

12  MR. HOWARD: I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg. 

13 Need go no further than simply to distinguish Hibbs. 

14 And we think there are at least four distinctions that 

we'd like -- I'd like to highlight today. The first is 

16 one that's -- Justice Kagan, your question goes to, 

17 which is subsections (A), (B), and (C) are all related 

18 in some fashion to women's roles with respect to work 

19 and family. Subsection (D) really does not speak to 

that purpose. 

21  And I think my second sort of distinction I

1 Howard, for a second, as I took from Mr. Foreman 

2 something that I hadn't understood from his briefs --

3 maybe I just missed it -- which is that he's making a 

4 kind of analogous argument, that, just as in the -- in 

the prior provisions of the Act, employers thought of 

6 women as caregivers and the response of Congress was to 

7 provide a gender-neutral leave benefit that had both --

8 that both women and men were eligible for. 

9  So here, employers think of women as needing 

more medical leave because of pregnancy, and the 

11 response of Congress is to provide gender-neutral sick 

12 leave. So, what is your response to that argument? 

13  MR. HOWARD: Congress, Justice Kagan, did 

14 not I think take that stereotype or perception that Mr. 

Foreman referred to into account. And I'd specifically 

16 point the Court to page 21 of our brief, where we cite 

17 some Bureau of Labor Statistics studies indicating that 

18 men and women at the time took roughly the same amount 

19 of sick leave. In fact, Mr. Foreman has conceded as 

much. And that same study projects that men and women 

21 will take roughly the same amount of time after the 

22 enactment of the FMLA --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there certainly 

24 was -- there was certainly much conversation and 

testimony that, whether they in fact took the same 

23
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 amount of leave time or not, that women who were 

2 pregnant or were perceived as capable of getting 

3 pregnant were hired less frequently because, 

4 subjectively, the employers thought that they were more 

likely to take the time. 

6  So, frankly, for years there was questions 

7 about whether law firms were hiring young -- not hiring 

8 young women because they feared they would leave in the 

9 middle of a big case or something else. We all know 

those stories. So, it is sort of common knowledge in 

11 many ways, but there was plenty of testimony related to 

12 that. 

13  So, assume that that was Congress's 

14 perception, because it was supported by the record or as 

much of the record as Hibbs recognized as adequate. 

16 Where does that leave your argument? 

17  MR. HOWARD: Well, I would make a couple of 

18 points in response to that, Justice Sotomayor. First, 

19 the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was already in place. 

And so, to the extent there were perceptions that 

21 employers might discriminate based on pregnancy 

22 disabilities, that would be unlawful under Title VII as 

23 amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. 

24  And the fact that -- and you are quite right 

that there is a fair amount of discussion in the 

24
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 legislative record, although I think it's less of a 

2 predominant theme than the concern for job security for 

3 working families, but there certainly is discussion 

4 about pregnancy discrimination and pregnancy disability 

as a type of illness. 

6  But we again would note that this is valid 

7 Commerce Clause legislation. And so, to the extent that 

8 kind of discrimination was occurring and leave was being 

9 denied or women were suffering adverse consequences in 

the workplace as a result of pregnancy discrimination, 

11 they could enforce the 12 weeks through a Title VII 

12 action. 

13  JUSTICE GINSBURG: They couldn't -- the 

14 Pregnancy Discrimination Act says that you have to treat 

pregnancy like any other disability. So, if they're not 

16 giving anybody any leave for anything, they don't have 

17 to give any leave; not 12 weeks, not 1 day. And that's 

18 what -- that's the gap that this legislation fills. It 

19 says, yes, you do have to provide leave for women who 

have disabling conditions, including pregnancy, but then 

21 you have to give that to men as well. You can't reserve 

22 that for the one sex. So, it was the gap in the 

23 Pregnancy Discrimination Act that this -- this was 

24 referring to.

 MR. HOWARD: Yes, I agree, Justice Ginsburg, 

25

1 but the gap that existed was the absence of a guaranteed 

2 period of leave. In other words, it was the absence of 

3 a substantive entitlement, and so -- to a certain amount 

4 of leave. And, in effect, the gap that was being filled 

served as prophylaxis for Title VII but not for 

6 constitutional violations. Now --

7  JUSTICE ALITO: Assume for the sake of 

8 argument that for the -- the applicants for particular 

9 provisions -- particular positions, I should say --

where the applicants are typically of a certain age, men 

11 tend to take less sick leave than women, because women 

12 also take sick leave for pregnancy-related illnesses. 

13 So, giving everybody 12 weeks eliminates the -- the 

14 possibility that women -- women who will be -- want to 

take additional -- will want to take more sick leave 

16 will be fired because they exceed the amount of sick 

17 leave allowed by the employer for everybody. Now, isn't 

18 that connected to eliminating discrimination in 

19 employment?

 MR. HOWARD: Justice Alito, I think that one 

21 could argue that that is connected with eliminating 

22 pregnancy disability discrimination. It's also 

23 connected to the purposes of (A), (B), and (C). I think 

24 that the principal reason why employers do view 

potential hires as -- when they're women, as likely to

4  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I don't think -- I 

have difficulty with the incentives argument either --

6 honestly, either as to (D) or as to (C). But I'm just 

7 talking about the -- an argument based on consequences. 

8 If an employer says you get 2 weeks of sick leave, 

9 period; after that, if you can't come back, you're 

fired -- that may -- at least for applicants within a 

11 certain age range, that may have a much more severe or a 

12 more severe impact on women than on men. 

13  MR. HOWARD: Yes, Justice Alito, and I 

14 think what --

JUSTICE ALITO: What would the answer to 

16 that be, that that's not intentional discrimination? 

17  MR. HOWARD: That would certainly be part of 

18 the answer, and what I was going to say was that what 

19 you are describing is a disproportionate impact on women 

as a result of assumptions concerning pregnancy 

21 disability. And, of course, if States were engaging in 

22 this kind of conduct or if there were a disproportionate 

23 impact, that would not state an equal protection 

24 violation under Washington v. --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why are you separating four

1 things? I mean, I've heard, it seems to me, three 

2 separate rationales. One, the easiest, is in (D) 

3 itself. Sometimes a woman could have a miscarriage, and 

4 of course she has to stay home. And that isn't covered 

by (A), (B), or (C). So, we cover it in (D), you know. 

6 And then we put the men in too because we don't want to 

7 make this incentive just to not hire women. That's one. 

8  The second one was the one Justice Ginsburg 

9 brought up, that there is a gap in the pregnancy law 

which won't work unless you have to give people some 

11 medical leave. So, here it is, (D). 

12  And the third one, which I think was related 

13 to what Justice Alito just said, is when -- you have to 

14 read it together to understand the third one. You get 

12 weeks all together. All right? Now, that means, 

16 once you put in (D), this Act will have less of a bad 

17 effect. The bad effect of the Act is if you protect the 

18 women, then the -- the employers say, well, we're not 

19 going to hire women, perfect; we have to give them 12 

leaves; we'd have to give the men -- terrible, it's a 

21 terrible disincentive. 

22  But then they worked out how to lessen the 

23 disincentive. And the way you do that, you say 12 weeks 

24 overall. And now look what happens. A woman wants to 

take, say, 12 weeks to look after her family, and she

1 gets separately sick, 4 more weeks. But how many does 

2 she get? Answer: Twelve, right? Twelve. You could 

3 answer that part. 

4  (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now let's think of the man. 

6 Let's think of the man. The man would like to look 

7 after the family, say, for 6 weeks. And he gets sick 4 

8 weeks. How many weeks have we got? 

9  MR. HOWARD: Ten.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Ten. Thank you. 

11  (Laughter.) 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. 

13  MR. HOWARD: I like these questions. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: So -- perfect.

 So, now the employer is sitting -- and it 

16 will work with other numbers. I don't rely on those 

17 alone. 

18  (Laughter.) 

19  MR. HOWARD: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But now look what happens. 

21 Without this Act, he's got a woman who is going to be 

22 out of there -- I mean, with the Act -- see, unless we 

23 put in four -- unless we put in the fourth part of it, 

24 we have a woman who's gone for 12 weeks and a man who's 

gone maybe for 6 but maybe for zero, okay? Maybe for 6.

1 With the Act, the woman's gone for 12, the man's gone 

2 for 10. You see? 

3  And so, the comparison there -- and it will 

4 work with whatever numbers you want. The comparison 

there is very different. And the comparison doesn't --

6 doesn't totally erase the problem with the woman, but it 

7 may reduce it to a size where the Act itself will no 

8 longer act as such a disincentive to hiring a woman. 

9  We have three different rationales. All of 

them are related to a serious problem, which is the 

11 problem of discrimination against women because the 

12 employers think they'll be home more. And so, you see 

13 the conclusion I'm drawing? Yes, okay. So -- so, where 

14 are we?

 MR. HOWARD: Well, let me speak first to the 

16 second one, the concern about the gap. The gap that is 

17 filled by the 12 weeks is -- is a -- is to provide a 

18 substantive entitlement. And when it permits a claim, a 

19 damages claim enforceable against a State treasury, it 

provides an entirely -- it requires a different 

21 justification than simply to fill a gap with a 

22 substantive entitlement. It becomes --

23  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The idea is it's part of 

24 one package. I think that's what Justice Breyer was 

getting at. But just suppose that Congress wanted to 

30
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 improve conditions for the -- in the job market for 

2 women, which I think it's fair to say was the motivating 

3 force behind this Act, and they also wanted to protect 

4 families so that sick children, sick spouses are 

attended to. 

6  Now, what leave policy would say, okay, to 

7 do that, we will have leave when a spouse is sick, a 

8 child is sick, a parent is sick, but not when the worker 

9 herself is sick? Without -- it's all part of one 

package which is designed to increase job security for 

11 women and increase protection for their families. So, I 

12 don't think you can slice off (D) from the other three. 

13  MR. HOWARD: Justice Ginsburg, I think you 

14 can separate (D) on the same analysis that this Court 

applied in Tennessee v. Lane, in contrast to the Garrett 

16 case. In Lane, of course, different sections of the 

17 same Antidiscrimination Act required different 

18 analysis -- analyses and reference to different parts of 

19 the record. There was a single over-arching purpose, to 

prevent discrimination against persons with 

21 disabilities, but the operation and effect of the 

22 particular claim requires a different analysis. As 

23 Justice Stevens said, the Court is not required to 

24 evaluate statutes as an undifferentiated whole.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, it doesn't have to, of 

31

1 course. But the whole point of the question that I was 

2 asking was, sure, what helps you by doing it separately 

3 is it helps your case. But if we look at what Congress 

4 was trying to do, they were trying to do it as a whole. 

That's my point that I want you to answer. And they're 

6 trying to do it as a whole because, no matter what 

7 numbers I use, if I look at it without (D) -- is it (D)? 

8 Yes, (D). If I look at it without (D), the ratio will 

9 disfavor the woman. And if I look at it with (D), 

suddenly the ratio from the point of view of the 

11 employer of the disadvantage of hiring a woman over --

12 over hiring a man -- it goes way down. And that helps 

13 women. 

14  And that is why, I think -- reading this and 

listening, a major reason why they put in (D) as part of 

16 the other, because working with that 12-week limitation 

17 and the whole rest of the statute, we now have a statute 

18 that doesn't defeat itself. We now have a statute that 

19 actually can achieve the end of leading employers to not 

discriminate against women. Not perfectly, but there's 

21 a big improvement. 

22  And that's the -- that's the argument I'm 

23 making. You have to read it as a whole to see that. 

24 And that's what I -- I wonder if there's an answer to 

that. Of course, I'm at the moment thinking there isn't

Official 

1 an answer to it, but I asked the question because I want 

2 to hear what you say. 

3  MR. HOWARD: Well, with respect to the 

4 ratio, I think the premise of that point is that women 

will take more leave for serious health conditions than 

6 men. And I don't think that's borne out. And, you 

7 know, Mr. Foreman has recognized as much. So, I don't 

8 think the ratio really changes. 

9  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what if Congress had 

added three additional subsections here and said that an 

11 employer has to provide 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that 

12 an employee can go to a health spa, 12 weeks of unpaid 

13 leave for -- so that the employee can travel, 12 weeks 

14 of unpaid leave so that the employee can take an 

educational course? 

16  Now, that -- those could be taken advantage 

17 of by either men and women. It makes both men and women 

18 increasingly unattractive as employees and, therefore, 

19 reduces the any special disincentive that might have 

been created by (A), (B), and (C). 

21  Now, on that same logic, would those be --

22 would those be provisions that further the elimination 

23 of discrimination based on gender? 

24  MR. HOWARD: I -- I think even if one 

accepted the premise, and we don't, that women take more 

33

1 leave for health conditions, that would further dilute 

2 the ratio, to have available all those types of leave. 

3 Now, I thought, for example, one could imagine --

4  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I thought Justice Alito 

was trying to help you. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: He was. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: He was. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: He was -- he's absolutely 

9 right, and that's why this isn't a health spa thing, 

(D). This is -- in fact, has two independent reasons, 

11 that all -- the miscarriage reason and the Pregnancy Act 

12 reason. And so, it isn't just saying go to a health 

13 spa. 

14  But I mean, I don't want to put arguments in 

your mouth, which I just have, which you wouldn't like 

16 there anyway, because -- but I would appreciate your 

17 going on with this discussion in respect to what 

18 Justice Alito and I have been talking about, and I'd be 

19 interested in what you think.

 MR. HOWARD: Yes. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And I'm working from a 

22 different proposition than you are in response to this 

23 question. I don't think that the actual amount of time 

24 that men and women take is relevant. The question is: 

What is the employer's perception, and did Congress have

1 a valid basis, as Justice Kagan pointed out earlier, to 

2 believe that employers thought women took more time? 

3  MR. HOWARD: I -- I think that if -- even if 

4 that were correct, and -- and I don't think it is 

because I think the overwhelming themes in the 

6 legislative record as a whole really were a concern for 

7 working families, whether single-income, double-income, 

8 and the concern that if a breadwinner falls ill, the 

9 family's going to have severe financial insecurity. And 

then there was also concern against discrimination 

11 against persons with illness. 

12  But I think that one thing I'd like to 

13 emphasize is that your -- your suggestion, Justice 

14 Sotomayor, and -- and really almost all of the 

discussion here today, I think, explains why this is 

16 good social policy. We support it. But I don't think 

17 that we've really gotten anywhere near the necessary 

18 predicate of unconstitutional State conduct when the 

19 constitutional right is defined with some precision.

 And I -- and I think one has to define this 

21 right as -- as disability. And I think also the 

22 protections that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act 

23 already had in place, when added with the substantive --

24 to the substantive entitlement, as a matter of Commerce 

Clause legislation, to this leave --

6 this on principle. 

7  As, Justice Kennedy, you've pointed out in a

6 likely that there are more men in -- in service deployed 

7 and that more women and wives benefit from that 

8 provision. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Was that -- that wasn't 

part of the original Act, was it? 

11  MR. HOWARD: No, it was not.

that. We haven't raised that as a point in our briefs 

21 or here today. 

22  JUSTICE KAGAN: And, Mr. Howard, I -- I do 

23 think that the point about the package is that if you 

24 look at (D) alone, when you abstract it from everything 

else, you have a good point, that it seems to be related

1 to economic security, which is not a section 5 issue; 

2 that it seems to be related to discrimination against 

3 sick people, which would also put us in a different 

4 legal universe.

 But when you look at (D) as passed at the 

6 same moment on the basis of the same record as (A), (B), 

7 and (C), with the overwhelming purpose of Congress being 

8 to protect women from discrimination in the workplace 

9 because of unfair stereotypical -- views about what 

women do as workers, then (D) assumes a different kind 

11 of aura. 

12  And you can talk about a number of theories 

13 for that, but I guess I would just ask for your -- your 

14 reaction to that, that (D) is just part of a package 

which was about telling employers: Get rid of your old 

16 stereotypes. Don't act on your old stereotypes. Employ 

17 women. 

18  MR. HOWARD: Well, I -- I would respond in 

19 part -- and I'm going to accept your proposition that I 

should discuss these provisions as part of a single 

21 package. But from the standpoint of States, subsection 

22 (D) provides a separate claim, a separate basis to sue 

23 States, and we think that claim is incongruent and 

24 disproportionate to any conceivable unconstitutional 

conduct that it might prohibit.

alludes in passing to headaches arising from pregnancy 

6 along with other stress-related conditions. But -- but 

7 all of the others really have to do with men and women 

8 benefiting from this leave for -- to care for a serious 

9 health condition.

 So, I -- I would really emphasize, in 

11 response to your question, that one could look at it as 

12 a package, but from the standpoint of States, it's a 

13 separate and independent claim, and it's an 

14 extraordinarily broad one. And it is not necessary, not 

simply because Pregnancy Discrimination Act claims are 

16 available, but, Justice Alito, there are Ex parte Young 

17 claims available. 

18  In -- in response to your question, in this 

19 case at the Joint Appendix pages 3 to 12, the amended 

complaint reveals that injunctive relief was sought, 

21 albeit -- and on page 12 is the prayer for relief. 

22 It's -- it's not clear whether that relief is sought 

23 under Title VII or FMLA or both. But the reason why I 

24 don't think -- the claim fails separate and apart from 

any sovereign immunity argument. Of course, Ex parte

1 Young is not -- does not protect on that ground. 

2  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But there's some focus in 

3 the legislative history particularly on the -- the 

4 family that has a single parent -- much more often a 

woman, not a man -- and the devastating impact on that 

6 family of the woman getting sick, the sole breadwinner 

7 getting sick. So, that was certainly an -- a problem 

8 for families with -- with only one breadwinner. And 

9 Congress was focusing on those women and wanting to have 

job security for them. That wasn't the only group of 

11 women, but certainly that -- that affected the -- this 

12 Act as it came out, didn't it? 

13  MR. HOWARD: Yes. There is discussion in 

14 the record of the disproportionate impact that you say. 

But what -- what is left out -- well, it -- it is found 

16 in other parts of the record that -- the relevant --

17  JUSTICE SCALIA: You're talking about the 

18 legislative record here? 

19  MR. HOWARD: Yes. The -- I'm sorry, yes. 

The record of -- before Congress. 

21  The relevant comparison, we think, is not --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that a closed record? 

23 Is that a closed record, the way a record of a case is? 

24  MR. HOWARD: I -- I am not sure I understand 

the question.

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: I just find it a strange 

2 expression to talk about "in the record" --

3  MR. HOWARD: Oh, I --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- when what you're talking 

about is legislative history. 

6  MR. HOWARD: I misspoke. I do mean the 

7 legislative history. 

8  The -- the relevant comparison we think is 

9 not between single-parent families who were 

predominantly women, but between working families where 

11 it could be two parents with a single income, man or 

12 woman; it could be a family with two incomes, but 

13 neither one can be lost. So -- and in any event, I 

14 think we're talking now about a disproportionate impact, 

which -- which would not state a -- an Equal Protection 

16 violation. 

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's a question of how 

18 Congress would do it. If they -- if they provided only 

19 for the woman who's the single head of the family, then 

that would be vulnerable under equal protection because 

21 they didn't provide it for men. 

22  MR. HOWARD: I think one would need to find, 

23 as this Court's cases have emphasized, a widespread 

24 pattern of unconstitutional conduct in the part of 

States. And I think the circumstances, Justice

1 Ginsburg, that you've described, do not flow from 

2 unconstitutional State action. They have their roots in 

3 other socioeconomic causes. So --

4  JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, the leave is a remedy 

for the problem. I think there's really not much 

6 disagreement about the problem, that there is gender 

7 discrimination in the job market. 

8  MR. HOWARD: Yes. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then the question is 

how do we remedy that? 

11  MR. HOWARD: Well, I -- I don't think by 

12 providing the -- the very sweeping remedy of (D), which 

13 -- I see that my light's on. May I --

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can finish your 

sentence. 

16  MR. HOWARD: We think that the remedy in (D) 

17 may cover the types of concerns you referred to, but 

18 I -- I would emphasize this is a disproportionate, 

19 incongruent remedy. It subjects States to far more 

suits for unrelated health conditions than the Eleventh 

21 Amendment should permit.

Official 

1  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

2  MR. FOREMAN: This is not responsive to 

3 disability-based discrimination. The findings and the 

4 purpose of the Family/Medical Leave Act make it clear 

that it is responsive to gender-based discrimination. 

6  Hibbs, in fact, found that the FMLA was in 

7 response to gender-based discrimination. In making that 

8 finding, they did not differentiate between the 

9 different leave provisions. And, indeed, if you move to 

Tennessee v. Lane, where Justice Rehnquist dissented, 

11 drawing distinctions between disability-based 

12 discrimination and sex-based discrimination, stated that 

13 the task of identifying the constitutional right at 

14 issue in the Family and Medical Leave Act was an "easy" 

one. And that was his word, "easy." It's responsive to 

16 gender-based discrimination. 

17  Chief Justice Roberts, I think your question 

18 about the military leave portion of the FMLA illustrates 

19 that -- what Congress was doing here when they added 

that almost 10 years later, they did not simply try to 

21 pigeonhole it into -- this is section 5 legislation. In 

22 the circuits at that time, there was considerable debate 

23 as to whether that could be justified as proper 

24 abrogation of immunity --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think it

2  MR. FOREMAN: I'm sorry. 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think it 

4 would be -- how would this case come out if we were 

dealing with -- with subsection (E)? Do you think that 

6 should be treated separately than the prior ones? 

7  MR. FOREMAN: Yes, it should, because --

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How? 

9  MR. FOREMAN: -- it was passed pursuant to a 

different constitutional power, and they provided in 

11 fact a different remedy, recognizing that the -- the 

12 Commerce Clause could not -- that Commerce Clause was 

13 the appropriate way to deal with this, and they provided 

14 a right of action by the United States in order to 

provide damages. 

16  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if we think 

17 that you should look at these provisions separately, 

18 where with respect to (D) -- and I'm looking at one of 

19 our prior precedents -- has Congress unequivocally 

declared its intent to abrogate sovereign immunity? 

21  MR. FOREMAN: As to --

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Unequivocally. Not 

23 on the basis of implications from -- from how the other 

24 provisions work. But if you do look at (D), is there 

any place where Congress unequivocally declared its

Official 

1 intent to abrogate State sovereign immunity? 

2  MR. FOREMAN: Well, I -- I think it -- yes, 

3 Your Honor. It's in -- they provide that the State is 

4 an employer for purposes of coverage of the Family and 

Medical Leave Act. And if you go to 29 U.S.C. 2005, 

6 where it says a public entity is covered by the Family 

7 and Medical Leave Act, then -- that damages are 

8 available. It -- it specifically includes "State." 

9  In terms of my colleague's attempt to 

distance this case from Hibbs, in all due respect, we 

11 think that Hibbs did the heavy lifting here. It is the 

12 same legislative purpose. It is the same constitutional 

13 right. It is the same statutory scheme. As this 

14 Court --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but your --

16 the answer you gave to my request depends entirely on a 

17 conclusion that (D) is linked to (A), (B), and (C) 

18 because, otherwise, you don't have the argument that 

19 it's precisely relief with respect to a discrimination 

under the Fourteenth Amendment. 

21  MR. FOREMAN: But you do, Your Honor, and 

22 that's the -- that's the discussions we had earlier, 

23 that it's response to gender-based discrimination, the 

24 stereotypes that pregnant women will take leave. And 

so, we think (D) would stand alone. But as the

gender-based discrimination. 

6  Thank you.
