 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 09-529, the Virginia Office for Protection 

and Advocacy v. Stewart.

 Mr. Galanter.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH M. GALANTER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. GALANTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The Virginia Office for Protection and 

Advocacy, known as "VOPA," seeks to enforce its Federal 

statutory right to inspect and copy records that are in 

the possession of State officials who run State-operated 

hospitals.

 Respondents acknowledged below that if 

Petitioner were a private entity, Ex parte Young would 

permit this suit. VOPA's status as a State entity does 

not change the Ex parte Young analysis because it 

imposed neither a greater burden on the treasury nor the 

dignity of the State. The only issue to be resolved by 

the Federal court is who has the correct reading of 

Federal law about the records access issue. It -­

were a private suit, let's say Ford Motor Company has

two subsidiaries, Ford East and Ford West. They get 

into a dispute. Ford West sues Ford East. No Federal 

court would entertain that action, would it?

 MR. GALANTER: Well, Your Honor, if I could 

clarify. First of all, there would have to be a 

question of Federal law.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes. They think --

Ford West thinks Ford East is discriminating on the 

basis of race.

 MR. GALANTER: It would have to -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That adversely 

affects their reputation, too, so they sue them.

 MR. GALANTER: I -- I think that inquiry 

goes to the question of adversity and standing, the 

Article III question. And this case doesn't involve 

that because VOPA is independent of the entity that it's 

trying to -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no. It's 

independent -- right -- it's independent from what?

 MR. GALANTER: It's independent from the 

executive branch. It's independent from the Respondents 

it's trying to sue.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes -­

MR. GALANTER: And it is -­

independent from the State? Is that what the statute 

says?

 MR. GALANTER: The -- the statute requires 

independence. The Federal statute requires that VOPA be 

independent. But it's independent here because its 

commission -- only a third of it is appointed by the 

governor, and none of the members of the commission that 

run VOPA can be removed except for cause.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You say on page 27 

of your brief, the blue brief, that there's no big deal 

here with respect to State sovereignty because 

ultimately the sovereign retains the authority to 

dissolve the State agency plaintiff if the State 

believes the litigation is too onerous.

 MR. GALANTER: That -- that's correct. That 

is, the sovereign, the Commonwealth, could repeal the 

law that enacted VOPA, just as in this Court's cases, 

ICC v. United States, Congress could have removed -­

eliminated the ICC.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a good -- a 

good cite for your proposition, but arguably in those 

cases, the ICC is really not the real party in interest. 

The real party in interest is the beneficiary of the ICC 

ruling.

 MR. GALANTER: Well, I believe this Court

has continually held that independent agencies and other 

Federal agencies can litigate, the cases involving the 

Federal Labor Relations Board. And this Court has 

allowed, for example, suits about licenses for Federal 

dams where one agency wants to build a Federal dam and 

another is -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To get -- to get 

back to my question, you -- no court would entertain 

Ford West against Ford East?

 MR. GALANTER: If -- if that's right, and I 

think it is if they're part of the same -- if they're 

subsidiaries of one corporation and aren't separate.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, why is that true? 

If they're separate corporate entities, what legal rule 

would stop a separate corporate entity from suing 

another? Is there a -- if they're part of the same 

company, I think that's a different issue. If they are 

the same company, that's a different issue, and just a 

different branch or a different office.

 MR. GALANTER: I -- I had understood that to 

be the Chief Justice's hypothetical. They were -- they 

were divisions of a single legal entity.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not divisions; 

separate corporate entities that happened to be wholly 

owned by the same parent.

MR. GALANTER: I do believe then that there 

could be litigation between them, but ultimately there 

wouldn't be.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I would have 

thought that would become an advisory opinion. Ford has 

an internal dispute, basically, and your -- in that 

hypothetical, one of the entities would be asking the 

Federal court to resolve it. Ford can decide at the end 

of the day how it wants to resolve it. If Ford West 

wins and Ford East loses, Ford can say, all right, this 

is how we're going to do it regardless of what the 

Federal court says.

 MR. GALANTER: Well, that's true that after 

the litigation is over, one of the parties may, you 

know, be able to work around the law. That's true, in 

fact, in every Federal Spending Clause statute where 

you're dealing with prospective relief. The State is 

always free to say, okay, if this is what we have to do, 

we -- we opt out of the program.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the State here 

is free to dissolve one of the -- one of the parties to 

the case. That's -- that's a little different.

 MR. GALANTER: Well, it's the Commonwealth 

that's free to dissolve one of the parties to the case.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right, State,

Commonwealth.

 MR. GALANTER: But I know. I meant, as 

opposed to the -- I wasn't making -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh.

 MR. GALANTER: But the Respondents here are 

State officials, and even the Respondents' agency has no 

power over IPAS. And on the day-to-day basis, even the 

governor and the attorney general have no control over 

what IPAS -- excuse me -- VOPA does. IPAS is a similar 

case out of Indiana.

 But what's critical here is that, as we 

stand here today, the Commonwealth has vested a Federal 

right in VOPA, and neither the attorney general nor the 

governor of Virginia can stop VOPA from exercising that 

right.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, I'm -- I'm not 

quite sure what the premise of your argument is. You 

seem to be arguing that the independence of the State 

agency is what makes this particular entity capable of 

suing. Yet, in your brief, you rely on Verizon's simple 

test, which says if you're asserting a Federal claim, 

you can sue and you're not -- and you're looking for 

prospective injunctive relief, you can sue the State. 

That general rule wouldn't look at who's suing. That 

was part of your argument. Yet, now you're arguing the

independence of the agency. Which is your position?

 MR. GALANTER: I -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And if it is the one 

about the State's independence, how do you articulate 

why that becomes important or not? What's the legal 

significance of that vis-à-vis this case and any ones 

moving forward?

 MR. GALANTER: If I may, I -- there are -­

there are three issues that are intertwined here. 

First, the issue that I was talking about with the Chief 

Justice regarding the Article III adversity that you 

need for standing. That's where the independence is 

relevant.

 The second question is the one that we 

petitioned on, which is the Eleventh Amendment issue, 

and there we would suggest that the simple 

straightforward inquiry of Verizon is relevant.

 And then there's a third portion which the 

court of appeals seemed to rely on, which is that -­

that the notion that the State has a Federal right at 

all was -- against another part of the State and its 

officials was incongruous. That, if anything, would be 

a Tenth Amendment concern and is resolved here because 

it was the Commonwealth itself that made the voluntary 

decision to vest these Federal rights in independent

State agencies.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, let's assume -- and 

-- and I'm not sure what the situation is in -- in the 

Commonwealth. We have held that the States don't have 

to have the same notion of separation of powers that the 

Federal Government does. In the Federal Government, we 

allow independent regulatory agencies separate from the 

President. Let's assume that Virginia has a system in 

which the governor is indeed in charge of the entire -­

the entire executive branch. Do you know whether that's 

the case? I don't know.

 MR. GALANTER: It -- it is not the case in 

Virginia or in 49 of the 50 States.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Well, if it were and 

if Congress offered money to the State and the only way 

the State could get it would be to abandon its system of 

separation of powers and to allow an agency of the State 

which would normally be under the direction of the 

governor to go riding off on its own and -- and sue the 

governor, do you think there wouldn't be any -- any 

problem about -- about the Federal Government doing 

that?

to obtain the Federal money?

 MR. GALANTER: I do think there might be a 

problem, first requiring it. And I think there might 

even be a problem if it were a Spending Clause statute 

alone. But if -- I realize that's the -- but that's not 

an Eleventh Amendment problem. That's a question about 

whether -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Sure.

 MR. GALANTER: And here the only question, 

because -- the only question addressed below and the 

only question -- this is all on an interlocutory appeal 

just on the Eleventh Amendment -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Got you.

 MR. GALANTER: -- is whether we can sue 

other officials in the State to bring them into 

prospective compliance with the Federal law. And as -­

as I said, though -- and this statute authorizes the 

State, if it takes the money, to designate either a 

public or a private entity as its protection and 

advocacy system; that is, they could have vested these 

Federal rights in a nonprofit corporation -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, right, but 

that makes all the difference in the world because they 

made the choice of saying this is going to be one of us, 

the State. And as far as what issue is before the

Court, I would suppose the Article III question is a 

jurisdictional one that we have to address before 

reaching the Eleventh Amendment question.

 MR. GALANTER: I -- I think that they're 

both sufficiently jurisdictional that you could reach 

them in -- in -- you wouldn't have to reach Article III 

before the Eleventh Amendment. But I do think that the 

Article III question -- I mean, this Court in its FOIA 

decisions such as, you know, Public Citizen v. 

Department of Justice, has said that Congress can create 

a right to access to information -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Galanter, if we can 

go back to get what this -- this entity was. The 

Federal legislation gives the States a choice. They can 

do it either in a State agency or a private entity. The 

specification that the State agency has to be 

independent is in the Federal statute, isn't it?

 MR. GALANTER: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not -- it's not up 

to the State to want to put it into an independent 

regulatory agency. And is it -- and this VOPA -- is 

that an entity that was created just to carry out this 

Federal program or was it a pre-existing agency?

 MR. GALANTER: It -- it and its predecessors 

were created just to implement this program.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And does it do anything 

else other than administer the Federal program?

 MR. GALANTER: It has a few responsibilities 

that the State has given it under State law in addition, 

but its primary function -- and at this point all its 

budget comes from the Federal Government, and it serves 

primarily this Federal function to go into public and 

private institutions to observe and make sure that abuse 

and neglect is not occurring there.

 And that is, obviously, why these records 

were requested, because the statute gives the protection 

and advocacy service a right to access records of people 

in the institutions to make sure that they are not being 

mistreated and that the investigations and the 

oversights by the State are taking place and are being 

done correctly.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, following up on 

Justice Scalia's question to you, his question in fact 

is in part what happened here. Virginia at some point 

did require every State agency to seek the permission of 

its attorney general, is it, to sue? And the government 

said that's not independent enough, and if you want the 

money, you've got to make VOPA eligible to sue without 

that permission; is that correct?

 MR. GALANTER: That -- that is correct. And

then the legislature of the Commonwealth went in and 

gave VOPA independent litigating authority, independent 

of the attorney general.

 On the Eleventh Amendment point, which is, 

again -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just -- I know 

you're anxious to get to that, but -­

(Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- do you know -- do 

you know of any other situation where one party to a 

Federal court action can dissolve the other one in the 

middle of the case? I mean, if VOPA files a discovery 

request with the State and they think it is, as you put 

it in your brief, too onerous, the State can say: Guess 

what, the case is over, you're dissolved.

 MR. GALANTER: Well, I -- again, I would go 

back to the Federal analogy, that in all this litigation 

with the ICC or -- well, with the Federal labor 

relations authorities, with the licensing authority of 

the Department of Interior for dams that -- that, you 

know, the TVA might want to build, that Congress can 

always eliminate these agencies, but while they are 

still in existence -­

States, the President could have dismissed the attorney

general, but we allowed the suit to go forward. I never 

did understand that.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. GALANTER: Well, I think -- I think it's 

because you look at standing in terms of the current 

reality, and in Nixon, for example, the attorney general 

had promulgated a regulation saying he couldn't dismiss 

the special prosecutor except for cause.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But there are a number of 

instances in the States where constitutional officers 

have their separate autonomy, their separate 

responsibilities. And it seems to me to follow 

inevitably from your position that the attorney general 

of State A could sue the governor of State A saying the 

governor is being sued in an Ex parte Young capacity 

because the governor is not following Federal law. I 

think that's just inevitable from your -- from you 

position, and that seems to me a vast extension of Ex 

parte Young. It's true, I think, that we've never said 

that the identity of -- or the permissibility of an Ex 

parte Young suit depends on the identity of the 

plaintiff, but don't we have to say that here if we're 

going to allow the States to structure their -- their 

own governments as they choose?

 MR. GALANTER: Well, I would say that --

well, I would say two things. First, the idea that -­

you have to accept, as I think Respondents do in this 

case, that the Virginia Office of Protection and 

Advocacy legitimately holds a Federal right. I can't --

I am hard pressed, and -- and Respondents and their 

amici were hard pressed, to come up with any example 

where an attorney general would hold a Federal right 

against another part of the State. And particularly 

here -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, he would tell the 

governor that the governor is not giving adequate 

protection to prison inmates or State employees, that 

the -- that the governor's own personnel regulations are 

incorrect, and he would sue under Ex parte Young.

 MR. GALANTER: If the Commonwealth -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: There are all kinds of 

Federal rights.

 MR. GALANTER: Well, but they're generally 

not the -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And the question is: Can 

one State entity enforce it against another State entity 

in a Federal court?

 MR. GALANTER: The -- there aren't a lot of 

Federal rights that State officials have against other 

officials. Here, this is a right --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but that's -- but 

under -- under your theory there would be, because under 

Ex parte Young, the whole point of it is that a -- a 

person can allege that this fictional private individual 

who's really a governmental individual is violating a 

Federal right. That's the whole point of it.

 MR. GALANTER: Violating the plaintiff's 

Federal right. That was the only point I was making. 

But, yes, if there are Federal disputes at issue, a 

Federal forum is appropriate, but -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: All State attorney 

generals have the -- have the obligation to enforce 

Federal rights for all of the citizens of their States.

 MR. GALANTER: And if they have that right 

under -- power under State law, then -- and they 

exercise that power and elect to be in Federal court to 

litigate Federal issues, that is not barred by the 

Eleventh Amendment, we would submit.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that -- that 

issue -- I know your white line is on.

 You -- you indicated that there are certain 

cases in which dams can be authorized by the Federal 

Government, I think, contrary to State laws, with 

municipalities. Do you know what those are? There's an

permission from another Federal agency to build

under Article III, and that's the only point I was 

trying to make.

 If I may, if there are no more questions, 

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

 MS. ANDERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 VOPA has properly invoked Ex parte Young to 

enforce Respondents' obligations under the DD and PAIMI

Acts here, because VOPA's complaint satisfies the 

straightforward inquiries set forth in Verizon.

 We don't think that it's necessary to go 

into State sovereignty interests to determine whether Ex 

parte Young should be allowed here, but even if the 

Court were to do that, I think it's unquestionable that 

there are no State sovereignty interests here.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think -- do you think 

the Spending Clause allows the Federal Government to 

condition the receipt of Federal funds on a State's 

agreement to change the structure of State government?

 MS. ANDERS: I think it does, so long as -­

as that requirement is reasonably related to the 

government's interest in the funds and in -- in the 

objective of its regulation. Now, there's -­

JUSTICE ALITO: Suppose the government said 

if you want Medicaid funds, the State agency that 

administers the Medicaid program must be headed by a 

person who has a 20-year term of office and is removable 

only for gross dereliction of duty. Would -- can they 

do that? Can the Federal Government do that? Can 

Congress do it?

 MS. ANDERS: I think it could do that, so 

long as that's not independently unconstitutional. 

think the State always has the opportunity to decide not

to opt into the scheme, and I think that's very 

important here because the sole aspect of this suit that 

Virginia challenges, which is the fact that VOPA is a 

State agency, is the result of two sovereign choices 

that the State made here.

 The first choice was to opt into the DD and 

PAIMI Act programs, to take the Federal funds, to create 

a P and A system that has Federal rights of access to 

which both State and private facilities are subject. 

And the second choice that Virginia made was to 

establish a State agency P and A system here. It could 

have established a private agency if it were concerned 

about -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Anders, I understand 

that most States that -- that are taking advantage of 

this program do it through a private entity, not a 

State; is that -- is that right?

 MS. ANDERS: That's correct. There are 

eight public P and A systems.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can EPA sue the Army 

Corps of Engineers for violating the Clean Water Act?

 MS. ANDERS: Well, I think you would have an 

Article III problem if there isn't sufficient adversity. 

If the -­

EPA wants clean water, and the Army Corps of Engineers 

wants to, you know, dredge the water in a way that 

contributes to pollution.

 MS. ANDERS: Well, they're both -- the heads 

of both agencies are, in that situation, I think, 

subject to removal by the same people, and so in that 

situation, you would have an Article III problem. But 

we don't have that problem here, because VOPA is 

independent under State law, and -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree with 

the Petitioners that Virginia can dissolve VOPA if it 

finds the litigation too onerous?

 MS. ANDERS: I think that that would not 

happen in practice, because if Virginia were to dissolve 

VOPA, it would be out of compliance with the Federal 

scheme, and so it would lose its -- it would lose its 

Federal funding at that point. And so I don't think 

that's a situation that's going to arise, but -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If -- if it happened 

to arise, do you think that they can -- do you agree 

with the Petitioners that they can do it?

 MS. ANDERS: I think they -- I think they 

could do it, but I think this -- this Court has 

previously adjudicated cases where, in theory, the 

government could have changed the case midstream.

U.S. v. Nixon is an example of that; the ICC case as 

well. And I think also in the Lassen case, this Court 

said that it could adjudicate a suit between two State 

agencies because the agencies were sufficiently 

independent from each other. They weren't subject to 

removal by the same head of government.

 So I think, while you might have an Article 

III problem in some situations, you don't have that 

problem here because of VOPA's independence.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you be a little 

bit more specific for me on what you mean about an 

Article III problem? Justice Kennedy was concerned 

about State attorney generals willy-nilly suing -- or 

not willy-nilly -- suing governors to comply with 

Federal law.

 Why do you think it won't happen, and what 

are the legal impediments to that occurring?

 MS. ANDERS: I think there are several. I 

think, first, you would have to have a Federal right 

that the AG would be able to enforce. He would have to 

have a way to get into Federal court. He would have to 

have a theory of standing, and I think this is not a 

situation that has arisen at this point. There are no 

examples of this. And so I think -­

end of it, isn't it? Or is it -­

MS. ANDERS: If that were sufficient to get 

into Federal court for Article III purposes. I think 

there might be some situations in which the attorney 

general -­

JUSTICE BREYER: No. Suppose the State law 

is the governor of the State cannot bring a lawsuit 

against the attorney general, and vice versa. Okay? 

That's the State law. Now, under those circumstances, 

can either bring a lawsuit on a Federal right in Federal 

court?

 MS. ANDERS: There may be some circumstances 

like that one, in which the State AG's use of Ex parte 

Young would raise special sovereignty interests that 

would counsel against -­

JUSTICE BREYER: No, but I want just a yes 

or no answer. In your opinion, can an attorney general, 

where the State law says, black letter law, attorney 

general can never sue the governor; he's fired instantly

itself. If it wants to have an attorney general that 

can never bring a lawsuit, that's up to the State, 

unless it's a due process problem.

 Now, suppose I believe that. Now, do you 

lose this case?

 MS. ANDERS: No, I don't think so, because 

the same special sovereignty interests are not present 

here, because under the Spending Clause, Virginia had 

the choice to opt into this scheme.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Doesn't -- doesn't the 

Federal statute say, Virginia, if you want to do this 

through a State agency, that State agency has to be an 

independent agency and have the authority to sue?

 MS. ANDERS: That's correct, and -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are you sure that 

the governor cannot remove the members of VOPA? I know 

it says VOPA has to be independent of any State agency, 

and the governor appoints one-third. Can the governor 

remove the members of this Virginia agency?

 MS. ANDERS: As a matter of State law, I 

don't think he can. And if he were to try to do that, 

that would be a compliance problem from HHS's 

perspective. And so Virginia might at that point -­

just looking at the provision where you say it's 

independent, and it says independent of any State 

agency. You said the governor may not appoint more than 

one-third. I just wonder if there's a prohibition on 

him removing.

 MS. ANDERS: Well, there's definitely a 

prohibition on him removing board members of VOPA or 

officials of VOPA as a result of VOPA's actions in 

litigation. I think -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Where is that?

 MS. ANDERS: Well, the provision -- well, 

the requirement that VOPA have full authority to pursue 

legal remedies to ensure the protection of individuals. 

This is on page 52a of the petition appendix. That's 

the PAIMI law. And I think that actually did happen in 

Virginia, that HHS came in -­

officials are engaged in corruption or illegal conduct

discredit upon the -- the governor has no power to say 

that, you're a Virginia official and you're -- you know, 

whatever -- breaking Virginia law, for example? And -­

MS. ANDERS: Well, under Virginia law, I 

think that VOPA's officials are subject to for-cause 

removal provisions. So they can actually be removed

judicially through for-cause proceedings. And from our 

perspective, that's consistent with VOPA's independence 

and its full authority to pursue remedies because that 

type of for-cause removal wouldn't be on the basis of 

VOPA's actions in litigation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Going back to your 

exchange with Justice Breyer, I assume that you could 

stand by your answer and say the attorney general could 

sue the governor, because he's not suing the governor in 

his official capacity. He has a Federal right under Ex 

parte Young to sue the governor as an individual. It's 

a fiction; we all know that. But that's the way it 

works, and this is a Federal right.

 MS. ANDERS: Well -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I think that's your 

position.

 MS. ANDERS: I think that's right, that 

under Verizon no more is required. VOPA has a Federal 

right here.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Of course -- of course, 

Verizon was a private party.

 MS. ANDERS: Verizon was a private party,

it's that he doesn't have authority. He's not a person 

that can do this kind of thing -­

thought Ex parte Young applied to defendants.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, right. Exactly.

Young allows -- allows an attorney general to sue -- to 

sue as a plaintiff in his personal capacity. Am I wrong 

about that?

question that those interests aren't present here

order to enforce these Federal rights. When it opted 

into the scheme -­

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARLE DUNCAN GETCHELL, JR.,

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. GETCHELL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The dignity interest of a sovereign is 

impaired if it is pitted against itself in the courts of 

another sovereign without its consent. And I would 

take -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: A dignified sovereign 

should not agree to the deal.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. GETCHELL: Well, let's -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, you know, the 

Commonwealth had the choice. It had two choices, as -­

as counsel for the Government said. It could either 

turn down the money or, if it's not dignified enough to 

do that, it could take the money and establish a private 

organization to do this work instead of a State agency. 

So, what -- you know, what complaint do you have here?

 MR. GETCHELL: Well, let me -- let me first 

say that the choice issue raises some interesting 

questions because of the procedural posture of this case 

being an interlocutory appeal. Because remember, on the 

issue of waiver and abrogation, that was litigated 

below, and no waiver was found, and that wasn't appealed

against. So if we're going to say it makes a difference 

under a spending statute that the State has taken the 

money in analyzing the sovereign interest, then we are 

creating a waiver on the cheap and disheveling the 

established doctrine.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's not a waiver; it's 

-- the Federal statute is clear. It says: State, you 

can do this in one of two ways. If you go with a 

government agency, then that agency has to have 

independence and it has to be able to sue.

 So if the State is given a choice, it has -­

it can do it through private entity; it can do it 

through, as in this case, an agency that was set up for 

this very purpose and no other, right?

 MR. GETCHELL: I would have thought two 

things about that. One is when Congress gave the State 

the choice of making it a State agency, it understood 

that any issues that arise from that would come with the 

territory. The second thing is what the State consented 

to is it waived its sovereign immunity to be sued, but 

it did not specify suit in Federal court, and under 

ordinary doctrine, that's a consent to be sued in its 

own courts, not in Federal court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you have a State 

which loves litigation.

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: Forty-eight percent of the 

population are retired lawyers.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: Nothing pleases them more 

than to have everybody suing everybody else. So they 

pass a statute which says, for purposes of lawsuits in 

this State, every department can sue every other 

department.

 Now, if you have such a State, what in the 

Constitution stops the Federal Government from abiding 

by that rule and applying ordinary Ex parte Young rules, 

looking at the defendant, looking at horizon, and then, 

if the plaintiff happens to be a Federal agency suing 

another, say, well, if it complies with those first set, 

the fact that A sues B and they're both State agencies, 

that's the State's decision. What in the Constitution 

can prevent the State from deciding to organize what 

we'll call the legal heaven way?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. GETCHELL: I would say two things about 

that. The first is that that's not what Congress did. 

Congress -- Congress said they had to have a right to 

sue, and they didn't specify it was Federal court.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. That's A. We can go

into A later because I agree that would be an answer, if 

it's correct -- I mean, if that is what happened. 

That's a different question, whether Congress could 

restructure the State. That's a serious question. But 

my question was on the first. Can Congress stop the 

State from restructuring itself?

 MR. GETCHELL: Well, I -- I don't think the 

State by restructuring itself would then ordinarily 

expect its agencies to sue each other in Federal court. 

In -­

JUSTICE BREYER: If they wrote it down 

specifically in the law and said we'd love to have our 

agencies sue each other. They don't say Federal court. 

They just say we love to have our agencies sue each 

other. They don't mention the court.

 MR. GETCHELL: I would think that, under 

ordinary rules of waiver of sovereign immunity, that 

would limit the suits to the suits of the sovereign, the 

State.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Why? What's undignified 

about allowing the State -­

MR. GETCHELL: I just -­

JUSTICE BREYER: -- to live with the choice 

it made?

is an unspecified waiver of sovereign immunity does not 

consent to the Federal court.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I -- I think 

there are concepts being confused. There's no question 

that it hasn't waived sovereign immunity. VOPA doesn't 

claim that. And this is not a direct suit against the 

State; it's a suit against a State official. And the 

entire premise of Ex parte Young is that this doesn't 

offend sovereign immunity for a party to seek 

enforcement, prospectively, of a Federal right.

 So I don't know why it really matters who 

the plaintiff is so long as the sovereign interests that 

we've recognized, that the issue of sovereignty is one 

that respects a State's coffers and State's laws and 

we're not going to interfere with any of them, but we 

are going to ensure that, because of the pre-emptive 

effect of the Constitution and our laws, that Federal 

laws are respected. So what's in this case the 

intrusion on State sovereignty when the State knew and 

consented consciously to letting VOPA sue for records 

when it needed to?

 MR. GETCHELL: In referring to sovereign 

immunity, I was trying to answer the hypothetical with 

respect to why Ex parte Young doesn't apply. The second 

part of the question was Congress could expect Ex parte

Young to apply. There's -- there's no indication in the 

legislative record that I could find of that.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The State should have 

expected that.

 MR. GETCHELL: Excuse me. That Congress 

should have expected. In the hypothetical, Congress was 

posited as having thought that Ex parte Young -­

JUSTICE BREYER: No. The hypothetical was 

just -- Justice Sotomayor is totally right. I'm talking 

about Ex parte Young.

 MR. GETCHELL: Okay.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I'm imagining -- I'm 

imagining a system where the State wants to let the AG, 

this organization, the sheriff of Middlesex County, the 

City of San Francisco -- they want to permit such 

entities to become plaintiffs against other parts of the 

State government in such a State if ordinary Ex parte 

Young requirements are met. What in the Constitution of 

the United States prohibits that suit from going ahead?

 MR. GETCHELL: Because Ex parte Young is an 

exception to the default position. The default position 

is that the States at the founding retained all of their 

natural law-of-nations sovereign immunity. We know that 

it was -- that it was limited. A State can sue another 

State; the Federal Government can sue another State; and

exception, but it is the exception.

 It is being extended here. We know it's 

being extended here because it's never been done before. 

And if you're going to extend it, then we ought to ask 

the question of whether or not -- asking the Hans 

question.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why is it an 

extension? I mean, I have sort of a bit of a problem 

with that. Why is it somehow a -- a greater 

infringement upon State sovereignty to allow a State to 

be sued in Federal court by a private individual, who 

doesn't even have to be a Virginian, for Pete's sake -­

he could be from anywhere, he could be from Iowa. And 

yet, it somehow offends State sovereignty more when -­

when you allow a State agency to sue a State?

 I don't -- I don't see why that's so 

horribly worse, unless you're arguing that -- that it 

somehow destroys the State system of separation of 

powers. But that's a different question, and -- and the 

answer to that is simply you did it yourself.

 MR. GETCHELL: Well, what I -- what I would 

say is that Ex parte Young is intended to deal with the 

situation where a citizen of a dual sovereign is able to 

vindicate his superior Federal rights against the State.

That interest is not served one bit by having a State

though that State agency could have sued in State court.

 And I would ask the Hans question. The Hans 

question is, would the -- you know, the Constitution is 

presumed not to raise up causes of action against the 

States that would have been considered as anomalous and 

unheard-of at the time of the founding. And I think if 

you posited whether or not at the founding, if you had 

asked, can a part of a State -- well, can the Federal 

Congress authorize part of a State to sue the other part 

of the State in Federal court, I think it would have 

been regarded as anomalous generally.

 JUSTICE ALITO: When Virginia agreed to 

participate in this program, did Virginia understand 

that it could be sued by VOPA not only in -- in the 

State courts but also in Federal court?

 MR. GETCHELL: I would assert not. I mean, 

that was the point of the waiver argument below, and the 

court said there had not been a specific enough 

declaration of the consequences of taking the money to 

raise a traditional waiver.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the choice is, if it's 

not in -- you certainly agree that this State agency has 

taken on the obligations of the Federal program, and if

it doesn't turn over records as the Federal statute 

requires it to do, it has to be amenable to suit 

somewhere. We know if it were a private entity 

administering this program, it would be suable in -- in 

Federal court. So this State agency is doing the exact 

same thing, because Virginia chose to do it that way. 

Where is it -- where -- a very simple thing, the Federal 

statute says turn over records to the agency, and the 

State hospital says no, we're not going to turn over the 

records. Where does the agency, whether private or 

public, that's administering the Federal program go to 

enforce the Federal right?

 MR. GETCHELL: The program would go to State 

court. Virginia has waived its sovereign immunity, and 

there is a remedy through mandamus.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you -- is that -- I 

mean, I want to make sure I understood what your 

position is on that. It's not that you go into the 

court that you ordinarily go to when you want to get 

documentary discovery; you go to the State's supreme 

court, and you -- you apply for the extraordinary writ 

of mandamus? That's it?

 MR. GETCHELL: If you have a -- if you have 

a clear right to these documents as a surrogate -- and, 

you know, that's a merits question that has never been

reached, whether this is a rights-conferring statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking you what is 

the forum? We have a simple problem. An agency, 

whether private or public, wants records. A Federal 

statute says you're entitled to the records. And I 

would like to know now, Virginia having chosen to give 

this newly created independent State agency the 

authority, rather than picking a 501(c)(3) organization 

to do it -- simple, we want records of these three 

people, the hospital has them, the hospital doesn't give 

them to us. The only way under Virginia law is to 

petition the highest court of the State for a writ of 

mandamus?

 MR. GETCHELL: I would -- I personally 

believe you could also do it in circuit court. I know 

this office has previously taken the position that it 

had to go to the supreme court, and I don't want to 

withdraw any concession that had been made there, but I 

personally read the statute differently.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But which office has said 

it has to go to -- to the State supreme court on 

mandamus? You said that the office has taken that 

position previously.

 MR. GETCHELL: The statute, the mandamus 

statute, has a fairly broad catch-all provision at the

end which I think would allow suit in -- in circuit 

court, but I don't think where it can sue really informs 

the doctrine here, because I think the doctrine here is 

if you're going to let, under the analysis argued 

here -- which is not modest; it's very, very broad. If 

VOPA can sue in Federal court under Ex parte Young, so 

can any agency of -- of the -- of any State that 

receives Federal funds upon which it makes the claim at 

the Ex parte Young stage, which is before you reach the 

merits -- any agency receiving Federal money that can 

dream up a Federal claim under Ex parte Young could sue 

the State.

independent litigating authority.

 MR. GETCHELL: Yes, and -- and -­

difference here.

independent litigating authority.

 MR. GETCHELL: I think -- I think Virginia 

happens to be unusual, as long as we're talking about 

the policy results that will come from this. I think 

Virginia is unusual in having as much control in the 

attorney general over who can sue than -- than a lot of

States do, because I think a lot of States have their 

own independent agencies that proliferate and have suit 

authority.

 But I will tell you, even in Virginia, there 

is a mechanism by which, if you had the governor in one 

party's hands and the attorney general in the other, the 

governor can declare a conflict of interest and order 

private counsel hired.

 And so, if -- if the University of Virginia 

wanted to sue the governor, or rather sue the attorney 

general, and the governor said, well, if you want to, 

and the attorney general won't authorize it, then that's 

a conflict of interest. I -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It hasn't happened. Why 

do you think? Don't you think it hasn't happened 

because there are so many practical political restraints 

on that kind of activity?

 What would happen, I think, in that State 

where there was a rogue attorney general is somebody 

would win; the governor would win by getting a 

legislative act that says it can't be done, or the 

attorney general will win because the political 

sentiments are so strong in his or her favor that the 

suit is actually welcomed by the population.

 So where's the intrusion on sovereignty?

States do what they want. The only issue is how do we 

protect Federal rights.

 MR. GETCHELL: I would -- I would say that 

it's never happened before because nobody's ever claimed 

before that Ex parte Young permits a part of the State 

to sue the other part of the State. And I would say if 

the word were declared from this Court that you can do 

that, that there would be a lot of political motivation 

to file suits.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It isn't that Ex parte 

Young, if I understand this right, which is why I 

mention it -- it isn't that Ex parte Young permits one 

part of a State to sue another part; it is a State 

permits one part of a State to sue another part, that 

that's common in the State, that the law requires it. 

And the question is, in that circumstance, should the Ex 

parte Young situation be treated differently?

 MR. GETCHELL: And -­

JUSTICE BREYER: Am I right about the 

statement of the question in the case?

 MR. GETCHELL: I -- I think -- I think 

whether or not the State has given independent authority 

to sue without specifying that it can be in Federal 

court, without waiving its immunity in Federal court, is 

not the issue in the case. I think the issue in the

not Ex parte Young should be extended to do something 

that's never been done before. I think that's the issue 

in the case. And I don't think Ex parte Young, which is 

a necessary fiction -- but it is a fiction; it's a 

necessary fiction to allow the citizens of a dual 

sovereign to vindicate his or her Federal rights in 

Federal court -- is implicated in the least when it's a 

State agency that could sue another State agency by the 

State's consent in State court.

know of any other statute in which there is an 

independent State agency that exists for the sole

of one as I stand here, but my supposition is that 

because the Federal spending power has been so 

dramatically exercised over the years, that there 

probably is one, and I had not thought to look for it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: In your experience -- this 

would be helpful -- would you characterize as common or 

uncommon situations where State agencies are given 

authority to sue other parts of the State? As I think 

it to myself, I think, well, City of Glendale v. State 

Water Authority, or Middlesex County Sheriff v. The 

Bureau of Prisons. That doesn't sound weird to me. It 

sounds as if there probably are a lot of such 

circumstances, but I don't know. What -- what do you 

think?

are two things to look at: lower subdivisions of the 

States, which in many States are -­

 MR. GETCHELL: Yes, but they're just 

corporations in -- in Virginia and in most States. 

There are a few States where they are treated as 

something different, but they are not generally regarded 

as even units of -- subordinate units of government for 

purposes of sovereign immunity.

Young. I would -- I would say that -­

JUSTICE BREYER: University of 

Massachusetts v. State Environmental Organization. Does 

that -- does that kind of suit sound familiar to you or 

-- or not?

 MR. GETCHELL: I think that -- that the 

States vary as to how tolerant they are of -- of being 

sued by -- having their parts sue each other in State 

court. I think I have seen titles like that, but I 

don't think that, as a principle of Federal jurisdiction 

-- because, ultimately, whether sovereign immunity 

exists, if it's not waived, does deprive this Court -­

or deprives a Federal court of the right to proceed.

 I think that deciding we're going to extend 

the fiction of Ex parte Young beyond the rights of 

citizens to allow the State to sue itself in Federal 

court is just something that's totally anomalous. I --

I just don't see how this Court would want to do that, 

even -- even if it thought otherwise that it was, you 

know, something that could be done under the logic of Ex 

parte Young. I don't know why you'd want to extend that 

and create -- and create the Federal courts as a venue 

for political grandstanding, which is what I think --

what you're forgetting is that Virginia took a lot of 

money to set up and get the benefits of Federal funds by 

creating an independent agency. It had expressed its 

desire to control the agency more, and it was told very

 What I don't understand is why you think 

that it's a greater affront to sovereignty that the suit 

is here as opposed to State court. The State has 

already said: We're going to take your money, and this 

is what we're going to permit -­

fiction and it's just something that we have to tolerate 

in order to have a dual system of -- of sovereignty.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So your argument is really 

-- really is a sovereign immunity argument. You're 

saying that the waiver of sovereign immunity, unless it 

explicitly includes a waiver to be sued in Federal 

courts, applies only in State courts -- okay -- and that 

that limitation should not be evaded by applying Ex 

parte Young to a suit in Federal court where the suit is 

by another State agency.

 MR. GETCHELL: That is precisely my view.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: So sovereign immunity is 

part of your argument, but -­

MR. GETCHELL: It -- well, it's -- I think 

it's all that's really appropriately before this Court, 

because, again, we're up here on an interlocutory appeal 

where the decision below in the Fourth Circuit by Judge 

Wilkinson is premised entirely on sovereign immunity.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Right. Now, explain -­

this is good because that's very helpful to me -- the 

exact statement that Justice Scalia made, and you said 

yes, that's exactly right.

 And then it is the case that a citizen of 

the State could come into Federal court and sue the 

State official under Ex parte Young, but you say -- but

the agency of the State can't do it, even though they 

have State litigating authority. And the reason that 

the latter is more injurious of the dignity interests of 

the State than the former is -­

MR. GETCHELL: One, the State is being 

pitted against itself. If you look at the very caption 

in this case, VOPA sued the State officials in the name 

of the Commonwealth.

 Secondly, there's a -- to the extent there's 

any authority, we have Ex parte Young here that gives 

rights to citizens, and we have a lot of cases that 

resulted most recently in Ysursa, in which it was 

recognized that the general rule is that subordinate 

parts of States, subordinate State authorities, have no 

constitutional privileges and immunities that they can 

assert against their creator.

 And if you wanted to know whether or not Ex 

parte Young should be extended into this area, it seems 

to me that the previous expectation would have been that 

the Ysursa tradition would have said, no, we don't want 

to extend this into this area.

I thought there were cases in which a 

subdivision is not -- a political subdivision of a State 

is not allowed to build a dam by State law, and yet it 

can go to the Federal Government, get a license, and 

build the dam anyway and just bypass the restrictions 

put upon its parent. The agent has more powers than the 

principal gives it because it relies on Federal law.

State for purposes of sovereign immunity analysis, I 

would have thought.

 But if somebody tried to get a personal 

recovery -- I mean, VOPA employees are ordinary State 

employees. I presume they're subject to the Tort Claims 

Act, so it is -- it is a State agency. But I don't know 

why the involuntary suing of the State in Federal court, 

which I think raises these traditional sovereignty 

dignity interests, would be reciprocal.

 I mean, if for some strange reason the State 

wanted to sue VOPA, I don't know what the answer would 

be, because it may be they waived all their interests if 

they tried to do that.

 But I think that the -- that the practical 

problem for this Court is that there's no limit. 

There's no practical principle limit to what's being 

argued here. And so we set up this intramural political 

contest in Federal court as a matter of course. And I 

think, doctrinally, that it is clear that this is an 

extension of Ex parte Young, beyond dispute, and I don't 

think it ought to be extended without doing a federalism 

inquiry. And I think if you do a federalism inquiry, 

you ask the Hans question: Is -- would this have been 

regarded as anomalous and unheard-of at the founding?

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The bottom line, then, is 

to -- to restrict Congress's choice. Congress wants to 

have an entity superintend this program for disabled 

people. So the instruction we would like to give 

Congress is: Congress, if you want Federal courts to be 

able to enforce the Federal right, then you have to set 

it up as an agency, as a private agency. You can't 

give -- Congress, you can't give the States a choice 

whether they'd rather do it through private or 

public organizations.

under the spending power, have said: If you want to

I mean, Federal court. That didn't happen.

 Also, let's not overlook the fact that the

the funds, and when this Court was faced with the 

question of whether or not to extend Ex parte Young in

acknowledge that if a State knew when it took the money 

that it was -- and when it created a State agency to 

administer the program, that it was letting itself open 

to suit in Federal court under an Ex parte Young theory, 

then everything would be okay?

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. GALANTER: I have three points for those 

3 minutes. First, we don't think that a State AG or a 

State agency could sue a governor if State law 

prohibited it. The question of capacity to sue, the 

power to sue, is one of State law. What we're saying 

here is that if a suit could go forward between two 

State agencies -- excuse me -- between a State agency 

and State officials in State court, that if that case 

involved a Federal issue, it can be heard in Federal 

court if the other requirements of Article III and Ex 

parte Young are being met.

 Second, there was some suggestion that Ex 

parte Young is only about citizens. But this Court's

to. All -- they could get into all kinds of arguments 

about EPA and all kinds of Federal rights with each 

other. I would think.

 MR. GALANTER: I -- I don't think that's 

correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. GALANTER: I think that most of the 

time, when a State is involved in a dispute with another 

State, it's about State law. This is rather unique in 

that respect.

 And that brings me to the third point, which 

is this notion of waiver. Now, we're not arguing here 

that they've waived their sovereign immunity. What 

we're claiming is that they don't have sovereign 

immunity to these injunctive suits against the State 

officials. We're not seeking damages, and we haven't 

named the State in its own name. But what we are 

suggesting is that -- that they -- it was the natural 

consequence, as this Court decided in Frew, that when 

you, you know, accept the Federal money and you are 

bound by Federal duties and that the -- the entity that 

you give the Federal right to has a Federal -- has a 

right to sue, that the Federal issues will be litigated 

in Federal court.

 And I would say particularly that here

just -- of course, Virginia renews every year to take 

the Federal money, but when it last amended the Federal 

statute -- or the State statute to create VOPA in its 

current structure, there were existing Ex parte Young 

suits against State officials.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

I have one question of curiosity. You said in your 

opening argument that 49 of 50 States limit in some way 

the executive's power in this area.

 MR. GALANTER: I -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What's the one 

State?

 MR. GALANTER: I'm drawing that from the -­

Indiana's amicus brief, and I believe they identified 

New Jersey as the State that has a unitary executive.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you.

 The case is submitted.
