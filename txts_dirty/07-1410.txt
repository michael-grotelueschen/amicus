 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first today in Case 07-1410, United States v. 

Navajo Nation.

 General Kneedler.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court:

 Six years ago this Court rejected the Navajo 

Nation's claim for damages in connection with the same 

action that is before the Court here, the Secretary's 

approval of amendments to the tribe's mineral lease in 

the mid-1980s. The Court held there that in order for 

the United States to be held liable under the Tucker Act 

or the Indian Tucker Act, the claimant must specify at 

the threshold a specific rights-creating or 

duty-imposing statutory or regulatory prescription that 

the government has allegedly violated.

 The Court found no warrant in any relevant 

statute or regulation to impose liability on the United 

States. In particular, the Court concluded that the 

approval of the royalty rates in the tribe's lease was 

governed by the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938, or

IMLA. Looking at IMLA's framework, the Court held that 

there was no, quote, "textual basis," close quote, in 

any pertinent statutory or regulatory provision that 

required the Secretary to insist that the tribe 

negotiate for a higher rate.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it said 

"pertinent or relevant," but surely that's limited to 

the statutory provisions that we examined in the case.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: But I think the way to look 

at it is what the Court said, that it found no warrant 

in any relevant statute or regulation, and it discussed 

not just IMLA but several other statutes which -- which 

did have to do with the economic -- excuse me -- the 

economic terms of leases, but --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question --

GEN. KNEEDLER: -- didn't govern.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question 

presented, General Kneedler, was limited to IMLA, to the 

Mineral Leasing Act.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That was the government's 

question presented.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Two things about that. The 

government's question presented was that the Court could 

not find the United States liable or -- was whether the

Court could find the United States liable without 

finding a violation of IMLA. And therefore, the premise 

of the question was, without finding a violation of 

IMLA, the United States could not be liable, and the 

Court found no violation of IMLA.

 But beyond that, the tribe's principal 

submission in this Court was that the United States had 

control through a network of statutes, including the 

ones they rely on here. But the Court also itself on 

page 30 of its brief in that case identified the 

relevant statute as being IMLA and the other two that 

this Court discussed and the general introduction to the 

Rehabilitation Act.

 So I think the structure of the Court's 

opinion, looking at the way the tribe serves it up, the 

Court said there has to be a specific violation of a --

of a statutory regulatory prescription. The Court found 

that the relevant one was IMLA, and it found no 

violation. And therefore -- and the Court also said the 

tribe's claim, not simply arguments made in favor of the 

claim, must fail.

 But if the Court concludes that its prior 

decision did not absolutely foreclose the litigation, we 

think it's clear that the framework that this Court 

announced in -- or reaffirmed in Navajo 1 itself does

foreclose the claim here. As I said, the Court 

concluded that IMLA is the statute that governs the 

approval of royalty terms in coal leases.

 On remand, the Federal Circuit relied on two 

other statutes addressing other subjects, the Surface 

Mining Reclamation and Control Act, which has to do with 

the regulation of environmental issues and matters that 

may arise in connection with a coal lease, and the 

Hopi-Navajo Rehabilitation Act of 1950, which set in 

motion a general governmental program to rehabilitate 

and improve the economic life of the Navajo and Hopi 

Indians.

 But neither of those statutes had anything 

to do with the approval of the economic terms of coal 

leases. That was governed by IMLA. So the fact that 

the Federal Circuit on remand held the United States 

liable on the basis of two statutes that have nothing to 

do with coal leasing, minus the statute that did have 

something to do with coal leasing, in our view shows how 

far the Federal Circuit has strayed from this Court's 

teachings.

 But beyond that, we think it's a fortiori 

that the court of appeals erred in its alternative 

holding, which was that the United States could be held 

liable on the basis of general common law principles.

The Tucker Act and the Indian Tucker Act provide that 

the United States may be liable only for a violation of 

an act of Congress or a regulation. And it was for that 

reason that this Court stated in Navajo -- in the Navajo 

1 case that there has to be a violation of a specific 

statutory or regulatory provision.

 Even as a general matter, under this Court's 

jurisprudence, there is only a very limited role for 

Federal common law, but that is especially so when what 

we are talking about here is liability for damages under 

a waiver of sovereign immunity, and the usual sovereign 

immunity principles have to cast considerable doubt on 

that. Only an act of Congress or a regulation adopted 

pursuant to congressionally conferred authority can 

provide for the payment of money out of the Federal 

Treasury under our Constitution.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there cases in the 

courts of appeals where Indian tribes litigate with the 

Secretary and claim an abuse of discretion for the way 

in which the Secretary performs the duties with respect 

to Indian lands?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Under the Administrative 

Procedure Act, there could be -- there could be claims 

brought, but those would not be for money damages. 

They're --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I recognize that, but 

I want to know, is there a body of law in the Federal 

Circuit that generally recognizes that the -- that the 

Secretary has a fiduciary obligation that's enforceable 

as a matter of administrative law?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Not in the Federal Circuit, 

to my knowledge, because -- because the Administrative 

Procedure Act --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I meant all of the 

circuits.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Yes. No -- in the -- under 

the Administrative Procedure Act -- I'm not -- just like 

any party could claim -- could challenge what was done 

by the Department taking particular administrative 

action. And I think there -- I think that was what --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what I was asking 

was whether there was some doctrine that the -- that the 

trustee -- that the Secretary acts in a capacity, a 

fiduciary capacity as a trustee. If that doctrine were 

out there, then that might be the basis for saying that 

it's a sufficient foundation for a money damages. I was 

just asking, is that doctrine there?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: No, not -- not in the way 

you put it. But there are cases that certainly talk 

about this, that the Secretary has trust

responsibilities. But there are a lot of ways in which 

that concept can be used. It can be used in a political 

sense in that the United States Government, through 

treaties or a general sense of moral responsibility, 

should look out for the Indians, and in the day-to-day 

administration of Indian affairs, to contemplate a trust 

responsibility is simply to mean that the United States 

has a special relationship and should deal in that 

manner.

 And under the Administrative Procedure Act, 

if there is -- if there is an action the United States 

takes under a statute that governs Indian affairs, that 

would be -- that would be subject to judicial review 

under the general principles, is it arbitrary and 

capricious under normal principles, does substantial 

evidence sustain the determination?

 But, particularly in a suit for money 

damages under the -- under the Tucker Act and where 

Congress has said there has to be a violation of a 

money-mandating statute or regulation, general common 

law principles do not suffice. As I said, for money 

damages, only Congress or an executive agency under --

acting pursuant to congressional authority under the 

Constitution can provide for the payment of -- of money 

out of the Federal Treasury.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I -- this may be a 

purely academic distinction, but you talked in terms of 

liability. Are you suggesting that the trust principles 

do not set a standard to which the Secretary is bound, 

or simply that they don't constitute a waiver of 

sovereign immunity?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: I think it's really both. 

The general trust principles, at least -- at least again 

under Tucker Act jurisprudence, general trust principles 

are not what establish the Secretary's duties. It's the 

acts of Congress that impose duties on the Secretary in 

this area as in any other, or regulations the Secretary 

has prescribed under it.

 Now under this Court's jurisprudence, the 

Court has said that the notion of trust is relevant at 

the second stage of the analysis. The first stage is 

the threshold requirement that there be a specific 

statute or regulation that imposes duties or rights. If 

the Court finds that, then at the second stage, as this 

Court has held in Mitchell 2 and indicated in Navajo as 

well, that may be relevant to determine whether those 

specific duty-imposing statutes in turn also impose 

monetary liability on the United States for violation.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Under both IMLA and the 

Rehabilitation Act, leases have to be approved by the

Secretary. Doesn't that impose a duty on the Secretary?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well, what the Court said in 

Navajo specifically with respect to IMLA, the Secretary, 

yes, does have to approve it, but the Court specifically 

rejected the proposition that there was any basis for 

liability stemming from the Secretary's approval of the 

lease.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, under the 

Rehabilitation Act, if it applied to this lease, what 

would the Secretary's duty be?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Section 5 of the 

Rehabilitation Act for approval of leases is essentially 

the same as IMLA. It provides for the Secretary to 

approve the lease. But, as this Court held in IMLA --

or in Navajo 1, the theory of IMLA is not to have the 

Secretary be responsible or to take the lead in leasing 

tribal lands for coal purposes. It's the tribe, subject 

to the approval, and the Court concluded it would be 

inconsistent with that arrangement for the Secretary to 

second-guess the determinations that the secretary had 

made. And the Court -- the argument was made there and 

expressly rejected that the Secretary was required to 

insist that the tribe negotiate a higher amount when it 

renegotiated the lease.

 JUSTICE ALITO: The Secretary has to apply

some standard, presumably. What is it?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: What -- what the secretary 

has adopted -- has done is by regulation, is to say that 

-- that there is a minimum that the tribe cannot go 

below. At the time -- at the time of the renegotiation 

of this lease in 1987, from 1984 to 1987, there was a 

minimum of 10 percent or 10 cents per ton. The tribe 

was getting 37.5 cents per ton. This lease was 

renegotiated in connection with a clause in the lease 

that allowed adjustments for reasonable rates, which is 

not the same thing as maximizing the tribe's -- the 

tribe's revenues, so the Secretary had a regulation at 

the time of 10 cents per ton. The Secretary now has a 

regulation that says the minimum royalty rate will be 

12.5 percent, which, as Court pointed out in Navajo 1, 

is the standard royalty rate for Federal and tribal 

leases throughout the United States.

 Now, what is significant, in further 

response to your question, is that regulation states 

that that minimum rate is 12.5 percent unless the 

Secretary determines that a lower rate would be in the 

best interest of the Indians. So the way this works 

then, the way the Secretary has implemented it, it's 

basically up to the tribe to negotiate something at or 

above the minimum. If it's below the minimum that the

Secretary's prescribed, the Secretary has to make a 

judgment that that going lower, maybe because of a 

geological conditions or whatever, is in the best 

interest of the Indians. And that is -- that is borne 

out --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Is that in IMLA or is that 

in the Rehabilitation Act?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: That's in IMLA. That's an 

IMLA regulation. The general regulations that implement 

the Rehabilitation Act have a similar provision. They 

don't talk about royalties, which I think is telling 

because royalties have to do with coal leases. They 

talk about -- they require it be a fair rental for 

property, not a maximum rental but a fair rental. And 

then it has the same sort of thing, that if it's going 

to be below the fair market value it has to be in the 

best interest of the Indians.

 And I think it's instructive that I know 

there's been an argument that this lease is governed by 

-- by the Rehabilitation Act rather than IMLA, and 

notwithstanding what this Court held in Navajo 1 six 

years ago, but in 1999 when Secretary Babbitt, who 

joined the brief arguing this is covered by the 

Rehabilitation Act, approved the amendments to the lease 

in 1999, he approved it under the IMLA regulations and

he specifically said that because the minimum royalty 

rate is 12.5 percent -- he is quoting the applicable 

regulation -- "I do not have to decide whether the 

royalty rate is in the best interest of the Indians." 

He went on to say: "But I think it is."

 So secretary Babbitt's approval of those 

amendments really explains the way the Secretary has 

implemented the statutory scheme, and we think that's 

certainly well within the Secretary's discretion under a 

statute that did not impose any limitations. With 

respect to the Rehabilitation Act, the general leasing 

provision of that act, as we've explained in our brief, 

does not apply to mineral leases. That continued to be 

governed by IMLA after 1950. But even if it did, there 

is nothing in section 5 that imposes any more specific 

duties with respect to royalty terms or any other terms 

than IMLA itself. Section 5 has to do with surface --

leases for surface users, business purposes basically. 

And that was put in there because at the time there was 

no provision for long-term leases if somebody wanted to 

bring a surface commercial venture onto a reservation.

 But the last sentence of section 5 of the --

of the act on page 171a of the petition appendix says 

that: "Nothing contained in section 5 shall affect the 

authority" -- "shall be construed to repeal or affect

the authority under any other act of Congress." So 

section -- and the other act of Congress here is IMLA.

 I think it's also -- I think it's also 

instructive to point out not only did this Court hold 

the last time around that the lease was governed by 

IMLA, that was the tribe's position in this case. Its 

proposed findings of fact indeed in the Court of Federal 

Claims, pages 524 and 525 of the joint appendix, said 

the lease was governed by IMLA.

 But the textual dispositive point is that 

the lease couldn't have been entered into under the 

Rehabilitation Act. The lease in this case provided 

that the lease would be for a term of 10 years and then 

subject to a further extension for as long as minerals 

are produced in paying quantities. That precise 

language is repeated in the lease, which shows that it 

was under IMLA.

 Under section 5 of the Rehabilitation Act, 

the lease could only be for an initial term of 25 years 

and then a further term of 25 more years. It wouldn't 

have allowed for this sort of lease here and indeed, 

because the initial lease term here was 10 years and 

then could have only been 25 more years under the Rehab 

Act, this lease would have had to expire in 1999, and 

yet it was amended at that time and continues in effect

and mining continues under it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: The other side says that 

certain standard provisions in the IMLA leases did not 

exist in this lease. Is that accurate?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: No. Well, they said -- I 

think -- the only thing I think they say along those 

lines is that -- has to do with the form of the lease.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: With the forms?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: The form on which the lease 

is used. I think what they said is there were several 

provisions that appear in regulations under general 

statutes that are related to leases. One has to do with 

the property can't be used for unlawful purposes, and 

I'm forgetting what the second one was. But it wouldn't 

be unusual that the Secretary might borrow or a tribe 

might borrow provisions from other leases and put them 

in this lease.

 This is -- again, IMLA provides for 

negotiation. So the parties are free to put in 

particular provisions of lease. So that the fact that 

there might be things that would parallel what were in 

the other leases we don't think is really dispositive.

 Also, the other significant thing is that 

the lease itself incorporates or refers to by reference 

the IMLA regulations. So even if somehow the lease were

thought to be governed by Section 5, even though that 

wasn't what it was issued under, the IMLA regulations 

would control, and this Court already held in Navajo 1 

that those IMLA regulations, which are in the lease, do 

not impose any -- did not impose any -- did not impose 

any duty on the Secretary with respect to the approval, 

approval of the lease.

 I should also point out that when the -- we 

cite this in our briefs, that at the time the lease 

amendments were approved in 1987 the Solicitor's Office 

did a legal review of the propriety of the lease 

amendments and that legal review expressly says that the 

lease was entered into under IMLA.

 So I think the circumstances are really 

overwhelming that it was entered into under IMLA and 

that the Rehabilitation Act lease provision does not 

have anything to do with this lease. And the more 

general emanation from the Rehabilitation Act that the 

tribe seeks to rely on here are too general and short. 

The Rehabilitation Act was enacted in 1950 in 

recognition that the plight of the Navajo and Hopi was 

very serious, and Congress undertook to study resources 

and put in the infrastructure and that sort of thing, 

and part of it was to have programs -- excuse me --

studies to determine what the tribe's coal resources

were, and that was done, and this lease grew out of 

that. But that doesn't mean that it was in any way 

governed by the Rehabilitation Act.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Kneedler, the 

last time -- the last time around, we remanded for 

further proceedings consistent with our opinion. Would 

you advocate a different bottom line this time?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Yes. I would -- I would 

suggest that this case be reversed. I mean this -- this 

concerns a -- outright and with directions to dismiss 

the complaint. This -- this controversy arose in the 

mid-1980's. The litigation has been going on since 

1993, and it's been -- this is now the second time that 

it's been -- that it's been to this Court.

 And we think in doing so that the -- that 

the Court should reiterate the analytical framework that 

it put forward in -- in its decision the last time 

around so that there will be no mistaking the way these 

cases are to be handled in the Federal circuit in the 

future by requiring that the threshold, a -- as I said, 

a specific statutory or regulatory provision that

Federal circuit also relied on the Surface Mining 

Reclamation and Control Act. And that -- and that, as I 

said, has to do with environmental issues in connection 

with -- with Indian leases. The Federal circuit relied 

on a provision that says that the -- that the Secretary 

should include in any Indian leases additional 

provisions that were proposed by the tribe. But that's 

additional provisions in addition to other environmental 

provisions extending from the statute that had to be in 

the lease. It was -- it was just quite a stretch for 

the -- for the court to conclude that that somehow 

controlled the economic terms of the leases.

 If there are no further questions, I will 

reserve the balance of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 I think I would like to start with Justice 

Alito's question because he said: Doesn't Section 5 of 

the Rehabilitation Act specifically require the 

Secretary to approve this lease? And Mr. Kneedler 

conceded that it does. And so then the question is:

Doesn't that create some kind of a duty? And it seems 

to me clearly it does, just as the Court I think 

implicitly said in Navajo 1, the difference between 

Navajo 1 and Navajo 2 being that this Court then went on 

to examine IMLA, the Indian Mineral Leasing Act.

 It concluded that IMLA very specifically for 

the entirety of native Americans and for the entirety of 

Indian mineral leasing had a preference to ensure that 

the Indian tribes themselves would -- would attain a 

certain self sufficiency. And it essentially advocated 

the responsibility of having to deal with individual 

negotiations and allowed it for the tribes to take over.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But, Mr. Phillips, I'm 

looking at the last paragraph, and it says: We have no 

warrant from any relevant statute or regulation, et 

cetera. So it wasn't limited to IMLA. Do you think 

that was just carelessness on the Court's part?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Oh, I would -- I would never 

assume that, Justice Ginsburg. I -- I think -- I think 

the operative term here is "relevant." And that is that 

the Court for purposes of analyzing the question 

presented and disposing of it evaluated not only IMLA 

but the other two provisions that the -- that the 

government and the Court felt needed to be disposed of 

at that point.

The Court didn't address the alternative 

arguments under either Macrow or the Rehabilitation Act. 

To be sure, they were argued. But I -- I have seen many 

instances in which alternative arguments were made, and 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand your 

answer. If you say that those were not relevant and, 

therefore, they were not covered --

MR. PHILLIPS: Not relevant to the question 

presented, which is the proper interpretation of the --

the Indian Mineral Leasing Act. And, indeed, if you 

look at the other two provisions, the opinion of the 

Court analyzing them through the -- through the prism of 

the Indian Mineral Leasing Act, it says those don't add 

to the Indian Mineral Leasing Act.

 Our argument here is that Section 5 of the 

Rehabilitation Act provides a wholly independent basis 

on which there is a duty imposed, but that duty is then 

implemented in the regulations that are identified in 

the -- in the Secretary's --

JUSTICE SCALIA: In the Rehabilitation Act, 

the requirements for approval of lease, is -- is that 

applicable to mineral leases?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Is that applicable to mineral 

leases?

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely, it's applicable 

to mineral leases. The -- the language of the statute 

is "business leases, including those for the development 

of mineral resources." So clearly it applies to Indian 

mineral leases, but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry. Where is 

the specific reference to mineral leases, mineral 

resources?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Mineral resources.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It says "resources." 

I don't remember it saying "mineral resources."

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, the development of the 

"resources" for the Navajo and Hopi Indians.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a big 

difference, don't you think?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry. The development 

for utilization of natural resources.

 But the basic point there is, at least as I 

read section 5, what it's saying is that it grants broad 

leasing authority. The Solicitor General is absolutely 

right about that. But that authority extends to certain 

kinds of mineral leasing.

 And that says -- and that's an authority and 

it's important to recognize this. Because while it is

true for the run-of-the-mill Native Americans who are --

who are engaged in mineral leasing it may make sense to 

say: Look, we -- we are going to take a hands-off 

approach for the most part. We are going to set a 

minimum ceiling or a minimum floor and above that you 

negotiate as hard as you want.

 But the -- but the Navajo were in a 

fundamentally different position in 1950 when this 

legislation was enacted. The -- the median education on 

that -- on that reservation was less than one year of 

education.

 The resources were $400 per year annual 

income. This was a tribe in horrible condition. And so 

it would make perfect sense for Congress to say: Look, 

for -- for most tribes we want to go ahead and have the 

approval be based with the -- with the Secretary taking 

a hands-off approach above a certain minimum, but when 

you deal with the Navajo --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is it your -- is it your 

position that it would be -- that it -- it is not lawful 

for coal on the Navajo Reservation to be leased under 

IMLA, that the lease would have to be solely under 

section 5 of the Rehabilitation --

MR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think it would 

have to be solely under it. I -- I think that's a -- a

false dichotomy. I don't think this is an either/or 

proposition. I think there are parts of IMLA that can 

reasonably be applied here, and -- and section 5 

specifically says no authority from other statutes, 

which would include IMLA, is meant to be superseded by 

the passage of section 5. So I think there is a rule.

 And I think that the lease -- if you read the 

lease on its face -- Justice Scalia asked the question: 

Does this lease conform to the form lease that you get 

under IMLA? The answer is clearly not.

 This is a mix and match between some 

provisions, it seems to me, that clearly provides 

additional protection for the Navajo and other 

provisions that --

JUSTICE ALITO: But the lease -- the lease 

doesn't follow the -- the requirements of section 5 of 

the Rehabilitation Act in -- in respect to its term. 

But what is your -- is it your position that in entering 

into a lease the tribe has the authority to decide that 

we want this to be under IMLA; we want this to be under 

the Rehabilitation Act? When it comes up to the 

Secretary for approval, does the Secretary have the 

authority to say, I'm going to approve this under IMLA; 

I'm going to approve it under section 5?

approve it under both of those provisions. It is just 

that IMLA in this particular context would impose a 

10-cent minimum over time.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: What do you do about the 

fact that the term of this lease would -- would not be 

permitted under the Rehabilitation Act?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I think it would be permitted 

under the Rehabilitation Act because the last sentence 

of section 5 specifically says that this is not meant to 

limit any other authority provided under any other 

statute. And since IMLA provides additional time and 

durational protections for the tribes under these 

circumstances, that provision would definitely allow you 

to use IMLA's time limits rather than the Rehabilitation 

Act.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Explain to me the --

the relevant scope of IMLA and the Rehab Act. The --

the argument that you made, that you just made, makes 

perfect sense if the Rehab Act applies to some kinds of 

-- of leases or contracts that the -- that the IMLA does 

not.

 And yet I -- I thought you were saying a 

little bit earlier that the Rehab Act applies to all 

mineral leasing, because that would be the development 

of the natural resource. And if that is so, then there

seems to be a pretty clear conflict, even on your own 

argument, between the term provisions in the Rehab Act 

and the term provisions of IMLA with respect to -- to 

mineral leases. How do -- how do we get out of that 

problem for you?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I think the -- the key 

distinction is to look at the -- at who is being 

regulated, and under the Rehabilitation act it's the 

Navajo and the Hopi. And -- and Congress said, look, we 

are going to take special care to protect and to try to 

put them into a position where they can even just catch 

up to other Native Americans.

 And so it seems to me that there is --

that's a special protection with a special duty, and 

that duty is enforced through the 162 regulations.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it's a special 

protection and special duty that applies to every one of 

the mineral leases, including this one, that the Navajo 

may be involved in.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So I -- what -- maybe --

maybe I missed the point, but would you go back to 

justice Scalia's question: How is it that there is not 

a conflict here between this lease and the Rehab Act?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Because the last section

under section 5 says that, notwithstanding anything 

else, this provision doesn't preclude -- doesn't --

doesn't limit the authority that would otherwise exist.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But that, in effect -- but 

that, in effect, is saying this -- this provision will 

never apply to a mineral lease with the Navajo or the 

Hopi. I mean, you are reading it right out of the act 

with respect to these two tribes.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is all that the 

Rehabilitation Act -- I'm sorry.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry, it's because the 

provision applies to a lot of other leases, too. Are 

you asking when the 20 or 10 and 10.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: With respect -- my point is 

with respect to every mineral lease of the Hopi and the 

Navajo, you are saying the term provision never applies. 

Am I correct --

MR. PHILLIPS: No, I understand. Right. I 

have the answer your question which is this provision in 

section 5 applies not just to mineral lease, it applies 

to all business site leasing.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But it only applies to 

those two tribes. And there is something very, very 

strange, it seems to me, in saying that the -- that the 

kind of -- the saving sentence at the end of section 5

reads its very term limit provisions out of every -- out 

of every possible application for mineral lease by these 

two tribes. And that's what you are saying.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But -- but -- but the 

important distinction -- and I hope I can articulate 

this -- is that section 5 applies beyond mineral leases.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: I realize that.

 MR. PHILLIPS: So that all -- so the time 

limitation of 10 years and 10 years, if you bring a 

barber shop, you want to build a barber shop on those 

lands, you want to lease the space in order to do that, 

you would be subject to the section 5 time limitations, 

unless for some reason there is another authorization 

somewhere.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But that, in effect, 

means that -- and I don't want to overdo your barber 

shop analysis or example, but that, in effect, says --

MR. PHILLIPS: I need a haircut.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: -- on -- on trivial lease 

contracts there are term limits, but on the ones that 

really count, where the real money is, doesn't apply at 

all.

 MR. PHILLIPS: There is a -- way beyond that 

there is an entire defense plant on the Navajo tribe --

on the Navajo reservation right now that would obviously

be subject to precisely these same limitations. So it's 

not just trivial, it's all business lease citing that is 

covered why that.

 So it seems to me not at all unreasonable to 

think that Congress, in its -- in its very protective 

effort here under section 5 would say, here are all the 

leases that you are allowed to enter into. You have 

broad leasing authority, we are going to protect you 

against overreaching by restricting how long you can go, 

but if there are other provisions of law that allow 

these to be modified in a particular area, we will allow 

those to be modified in that way.

 And in this context, what that last sentence 

would, in my mind, say is there is no reason to try 

and -- to say that IMLA or the Rehabilitation Act. It 

seems to me much more sensible to say that Congress 

would have intended multiple protections for the Navajo.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume that, and I --

I -- I think your argument is well taken. But assuming 

that, don't we also have to assume that the stress in 

IMLA on placing primary responsibility on the tribes, 

not on the Secretary should, in fact, also be imported 

to the application of the Rehab Act as you say it should 

be applied.

think that's an authority. I would say -- I would not 

read --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What's not an authority?

 MR. PHILLIPS: The notion that the Navajo 

tribe would be in a position to better -- to better --

to -- I'm sorry, to achieve self-sufficiency.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. You made a good 

argument a few moments ago for the fact that it would 

have been at least at one time inappropriate to thrust 

that responsibility on the Navajo, but there was no 

Navajo exception in IMLA. That responsibility was 

thrust on the Navajo --

MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sure there isn't --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- and this Court 

recognized that.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. But that's exactly 

why the Navajo Rehabilitation Act of 1950 does modify 

IMLA.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: With respect to that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Expired --

MR. PHILLIPS: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the opinion in the 

last time around not only contained the statement that I 

read before, that is, any relevant statute, but in the 

very beginning it says, "We hold the tribe's claim for

compensation from the federal government failed," and 

there is a well known distinction between a claim at 

issue and attributing to the Court that kind of 

carelessness for saying that the claim is barred as 

distinguished from an issue, the issue being IMLA. I 

think the Court was conscious of that distinction when 

it used the word that the claim failed, not just the 

issue.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Obviously, Justice Ginsburg, 

you are in a much better position to judge what was 

intended here. On the other hand, my experience with 

the Court generally is that when you analyze a case, 

that you analyze it in terms of the specific question 

that is presented, and if you are posing to go beyond 

the question presented, you say so expressly, not simply 

by the use of the word "claim" or "argument."

 So while I recognize that the Court -- that 

the government has an argument to be made that has 

pre-decided that, I think, frankly, one, the Court 

didn't decide this issue; and two, the Court should 

decide the question that was presented here as to the 

scope of section 5, because it's obviously of 

extraordinary importance to not only section 5 but also 

to section 8 as well.

government says that by the time this lease was 

executed, the Rehabilitation Act was a dead letter. 

That it was meant to stimulate economic activity on the 

Navajo reservation, and there were funds appropriated 

for that purpose and that all had been played out by the 

time this lease was entered into.

 Is there something wrong with that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yeah, the government's wrong 

about that. I believe -- the program itself is for the 

overall rehabilitation of the Navajo and the Hopi. 

There are a series of projects that the -- where the 

statute says such programs shall include the following 

projects. It doesn't say it's limited to the following 

projects, and those projects have been set out over 

time.

 But the program itself is not limited that 

way and more fundamentally, it is completely 

inconsistent with that kind of time limitation on the 

statute overall. Congress would have repealed certain 

sections of this act, sections 9 and 10 after the 

10-year period that expired if the statute didn't have 

any continuing implication.

 It also would have meant that the leasing 

protections in section 5 had expired after 10 years, 

which seems to me quite inconsistent with the overall

purpose here to accomplish that. So I think the 

temporal argument doesn't get the government 

particularly far.

 I would like to take a second to talk about 

sort what I think is an important distinction between 

635 and other provisions, which is that 634(a) imposes a 

duty that the Secretary's brief, I think, evidently sets 

out, that duty means that you have to make sure there is 

fair market value, that those are reasonable rates, and 

that was not done. So that's the violation that took 

place.

 Then the question is, is there a 

money-generating, money-mandating obligation imposed 

here. And there it seems to be the distinction between 

635(a), which said nothing about liability, and 635(b) 

and (c), which expressly -- expressly excludes the 

possibility of liability, suggests clearly why 635(a) 

ought to be viewed by this Court as a sufficient -- as 

creating a fair inference, is what the Court said in 

Mitchell two, a fair inference under these particular 

circumstances.

 The other issue that we have put on the 

table that the government didn't actually address in its 

opening, although I have to suspect --

635(a) creates an inference that 635(c) creates a 

fiduciary duty?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, 635(a) creates the 

fiduciary duties. The juxtaposition of (a) to (b) and 

(c) demonstrates that that duty is a money-mandating or 

rights-creating duty that's enforceable under the Indian 

Tucker Act, Justice Breyer.

 The other duty, it seems to me, that the 

Secretary breached there is the duty embedded in section 

8 of this statute, which requires him to make 

disclosures as part of this program. And the one thing 

that is absolutely clear that the Court of Federal 

Claims --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's the part that I'm 

not getting. You are saying -- the question, I guess, 

basically is, does the language of 635(a) that says with 

the approval of the Secretary, the Indians can, among 

other things, for business purposes lease the land. 

Right? That's what it says?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And then --

JUSTICE BREYER: And that doesn't seem much 

different from the IMLA, to tell you the truth, to me. 

It doesn't seem different at all. But now you are 

saying, no, it's really different because look at (b) 

and (c), that's your basic argument?

all supervision, and so forth, or it has to be at a fair

doesn't --

JUSTICE BREYER: (B) and (c) say that land is 

owned in fee but, let's see -- what is -- sorry, I don't 

want to delay you on this. I thought that (b) and (c),

a trust obligation.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, just to read (b) which 

unfortunately isn't reproduced I don't think in any of 

the papers, but it says notwithstanding any other 

provision of law, land owned in fee simple by the Navajo 

may be leased, sold or otherwise disposed of by the sole 

authority of the tribal council in any manner that a 

similar land in this State is situated may be leased, 

sold or otherwise disposed of by other private land 

owners, and the -- such disposition shall create no 

liability on the part of the United States.

relationship?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, that -- the -- the trust 

relationship doesn't come out of the PNC; the money 

creating component of it, it seems to me comes, out of 

PNC. The trust relationship comes from the fact that 

the entirety of the statute was enacted to implement the 

treaties, that these are all lands that are held in 

trust, and that -- and that there is a specific duty 

embedded in (a) that requires that the Secretary approve 

what is otherwise basically controlled as a trust 

arrangement, and that is implemented through regulations 

that require the Secretary to do this under a fair 

market value standard.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, give me an -- an 

instance in the statute that is in opposition brief of 

the orange brief at page 5. Give me an example of why 

the last clause "and such disposition shall create no 

liability on the part of the United States," what 

contingency was that directed to if not the one that is 

before us?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, that's for the sale of 

fee simple lands, so you are dealing with a very 

different set of -- of circumstances. Which is talking 

about -- it's aimed clearly at a different set of 

properties that were being held and therefore they said,

when you engage in leases for that kind of property, 

there is no liability.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But your -- your argument 

is that simply because there isn't that kind of an 

exclusion in (a), there must have been an intent to 

permit liability.

 MR. PHILLIPS: A fair inference, I think is 

all I have to demonstrate --

JUSTICE BREYER: Thank you, but now what of 

course is at the back of my mind is I'm trying to see, 

if this -- is this statute stronger for you than the 

statute we already considered? And I start with some 

suspicion, because I think if it is a stronger statute 

for you, you would have argued it the last time. So I 

wonder why you didn't.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I wasn't here then.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So somebody thought maybe 

it was a weaker statute, so -- but I will put that 

suspicion aside.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Can I ask you --

JUSTICE BREYER: So anyhow that's the 

fundamental question in my mind. I look at the language 

and so forth, but the language doesn't seem any stronger 

for you, at least at first blush.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. There's two -- there

are two answers; I was being facetious as to why we 

didn't push this argument the last time. It was largely 

because the Federal Circuit concluded the last time 

based on IMLA alone that there was in fact a sufficient 

right-creating provision. And therefore we depended --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So did you, Mr. Phillips. 

Last time around you acknowledged that the Peabody lease 

was governed only by IMLA. That -- those words were 

from your brief last time around.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know if those were 

from the brief. I know there was a statement of 

undisputed facts in the first round of litigation. But 

there is no question in the Court -- if we are right, 

that the Court remanded to -- from consideration 

consistent with this. We then went down upon remand 

from the Federal Circuit; we took additional discovery; 

and we obtained the information that we got. And also, 

remember, the United States' brief in the Ninth Circuit 

specifically says that this was approved pursuant to the 

Rehabilitation Act --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I thought -- you are 

really saying that you were wrong in make that 

concession.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That was an overstatement, 

there's no question. Based on what we knew at the time,

we thought it was in fact an IMLA lease, but in truth --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: In -- IMLA --

MR. PHILLIPS: -- is it's not IMLA, anyway.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it is the statute 

that seems most closely on point, because it's the only 

one that talks about mineral leases exclusively.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, but this is the only one 

that deals specifically with the Navajo Reservation and 

deals with leasing for business purposes for the 

development of resources. And so while I -- I agree 

with you in one sense, the other one has a -- some 

superficial closeness here. It seems to me that the 

closer one is actually the provision that deals with 

this specific reservation and this specific type of a 

lease arrangement.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you knew all of 

that -- that's not -- that's not something you 

discovered on remand. You knew all that before.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, we -- we obtained 

additional information, certainly, you know. We have 

the Udall declaration that specifically said that when 

he negotiated this lease he negotiated it as the 

centerpiece of the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act of 

1950.

 MR. PHILLIPS: It was after the first time 

around. I mean, there is no question that if we had won 

the first time around, we would have stood by that 

statement, but having lost it --

(Laughter.)

 MR. PHILLIPS: -- there is a tendency to 

focus the mind elsewhere, and we did. But the reality 

is that if you look at the parties, the -- Secretary 

Udall specifically says this was adopted pursuant to the 

Rehabilitation Act. Peabody Coal Company in briefing in 

the Arizona courts has specifically said that this was 

approved under the Rehabilitation Act, and the United 

States Government itself in briefing in other courts has 

said that this was approved pursuant to the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You bring in Federal 

officials to testify years after the fact as to what 

basis they acted earlier? That's very strange to me. I 

don't know what -- what motive Secretary Udall has today 

that might induce him to say that.

at the time, I could understand it, but bringing him in

Justice Scalia.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, Justice Scalia, I 

understand that, but the -- the bottom line here is, the 

question is, is this, you know -- is it absolutely clear 

that this is exclusively an IMLA lease? And the answer 

to that is there is a lot of evidence that suggests no. 

It's not in the form of IMLA; there are a lot from other 

statements that say yes, and more fundamentally it seems 

to me is the Court should not view it as an either/or 

proposition. It could be adopted under IMLA or it could 

be adopted separately. So the section 8 argument --

JUSTICE ALITO: I thought that your argument 

earlier was that all leases of mineral rights on the 

Navajo-Hopi land are governed by the Rehabilitation Act, 

and it's not a factual question as to which statute 

anybody chose at the time of the negotiation of the 

lease. But recently, in the last few minutes, you seem 

to be arguing that it was a factual issue that was --

that was unearthed only through later discovery.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I don't know that it's 

a factual question; it is that candidly, we obviously 

focused more on IMLA because the Federal Circuit --

first of all, the Court of Federal Claims in the first 

go-around adopted IMLA as the test and just said you

lose because you don't have an IMLA lease here; and we 

had argued here that it's not just an IMLA lease. Then 

we went to the Federal Circuit and we won on the grounds 

that it was an IMLA controlled error and we should 

prevail on that basis. When it was sent back down and 

we obviously didn't have IMLA available, since the 

Federal Circuit specifically precluded us from any 

further reliance on IMLA, we looked at the other 

provisions; we tried to understand their context, and 

then that -- all I'm trying to do is explain why it is 

that we would suddenly focus more on the Navajo act, not 

to say that you couldn't read the statute and say it 

would necessarily apply in that circumstance.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That isn't really my 

question, because I've tried to erase from my mind any 

suspicion about why you did or didn't argue it last 

time; and looking at it straight afresh, I think when 

the Court of Claims got this back, as any judge would, 

the first thing they do is look at the words of the old 

statute, look at the words of the new statute, and try 

to figure out if the new statute that you cited is 

somehow more supportive of your claim than the old one 

was.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. So what have we got

here in that respect? What we seem to have is two later 

provisions that say the government shall have no 

liability when it enters into leases. I mean, maybe 

that helps you, but at the moment, I am slightly 

escaping it. And then I guess there is some regs that 

were promulgated after the lease was entered into and 

seem on their face to deal with other matters. Okay, 

now, what am I missing?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I'm not sure I understand the 

last part about --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well the regs you didn't 

emphasize, so forget them. If you don't want to rely on 

them we won't.

 The -- but I've looked for everything I 

could find that would support you on this basis --

MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- and there you are, so I 

want to you add something to explain --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I would go back to 

Justice Alito's first question that was posed to Mr. 

Kneedler, which was is this provision has a duty --

because it has an approval requirement; and the answer 

is yes, this Court in Navajo I looked further at IMLA, 

at that specific statute, and concluded that that 

statute overall had a very significant limitation

embedded in that duty; and the question is, is there 

anything in the Rehabilitation Act that has that same 

limitation?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay.

 MR. PHILLIPS: And my answer to that is no, 

there is nothing in it; and contrary to the overall 

intent of IMLA, which was to guarantee self-sufficiency, 

the overall intent of this statute was to allow the 

Navajo to come somewhere in the area of those standards. 

In addition to that, I do think there are regulations 

that do require the Secretary to invoke a fair market 

value assessment of the rates that are embedded in this 

lease, and that he did not -- he clearly did not do 

that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even if you are 

right about the duty-creating aspect, what -- talk a 

little about the money-mandating aspect, the second 

stage of the analysis under Navajo I.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I -- I think the key to 

that is -- is sort of two-fold. One, I think when you 

-- in the absence of some clear statement in this 

statute akin to the one that existed in IMLA, that 

reduces the duty of the United States, that the Court 

ought to then simply examine this against the background 

of the trust principles and say you have a duty; you

ought to exercise your duty consistent with your role as 

a trustee; and you ought to -- you ought to be acting in 

the best interests of the Navajo Nation.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Before we find a 

waiver of sovereign immunity opening up the Treasury of 

the United States, we usually insist on something a 

little more specific than general trust principles.

 MR. PHILLIPS: And then the second -- I 

mean, if you are not prepared to accept the general 

trust principles, although, again, they go through the 

context of a specific imposed duty that -- that 635(a) 

has in the first instance. But even if you want to go 

beyond that, then I go to 635(b) and (c), where Congress 

clearly seems to have in mind the possibility of not 

having liability imposed in certain circumstances and 

yet left 635(a) there without a similar protection for 

the United States, which, again, may not be the 

compelled inference, but it certainly seems to me to 

create a fair inference.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's not how 

the Secretary reads 635. Isn't he entitled to Chevron 

deference?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, unless you are saying 

that -- I don't know what context Mr. Chief Justice was 

talking about. I mean -- but to be sure, lawyers don't

want to read it that way because they are in litigation 

right now. But I don't see anything in the statutory 

scheme or in the regulatory scheme that would say that. 

And certainly, if you go back and look at the 

Secretary's brief, in their analysis of the regulatory 

scheme, the -- let me see if I can find this -- page 25 

to 26, where they point out that there was a gap where 

-- where the Secretary did not exclude mineral leasing 

from the 635 --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What did Secretary Udall 

think about this?

 MR. PHILLIPS: He's fully on board, Justice 

Scalia.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. PHILLIPS: It's not in the brief.

 I'll just conclude with the section (a) 

argument, which is to recognize that the Secretary did 

owe a duty of candor and disclosure embedded in section 

(a). That program did not end. That disclosure 

responsibility did not end. What the measure of damages 

for that breach of duty is a question that obviously is 

still open on remand. But the notion that the Secretary 

can behave the way the Secretary did in this case, which 

is to know that he was not going to take personal 

jurisdiction over the final decision, command that no

negotiate with one hand tied behind their back at a 

minimum, and then handed up an agreement that was half 

what the fair market value would have been for the 

quality of coal is an outrage, and the Court ought to 

allow the damages action to go forward.

 If there are no further questions, I urge 

the Court to affirm.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 GEN. KNEEDLER: First, Mr. Chief Justice, 

with respect to the text of section 5, it doesn't -- it 

doesn't by any means suggest that it covers mineral 

leases. The pertinent phrase is that they -- that the 

tribe or members of the tribe "may lease" -- "with the 

approval of the Secretary, may lease for various 

religious, recreational, or business purposes, including 

the development" of utilization -- "or utilization of 

natural resources in connection with the operations 

under those leases." It's not a free-standing mineral

lease or resource lease provision. It says, "including" 

and "in connection with operations under such leases," 

referring back to business leases or the other things 

there. So I think, on its face, it doesn't suggest it 

covers mineral leases.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that --

GEN. KNEEDLER: But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it says "the 

development or utilization of natural resources."

 GEN. KNEEDLER: "In connection with 

operations under such leases." And -- and what's above,

leases. It's educational, recreational, and business 

leases. And as we explained, there are specific --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, why isn't it a 

public purpose to develop Indian minerals? That 

benefits the Indians and whole country.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: It says "business" 

purposes," and as such --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: No, it says "public."

 GEN. KNEEDLER: "For public, religious" --

"public" would be like for a school, if a State was 

going to put a school on or something, but -- but the --

but as we explain in our brief, there was a specific 

reason why Congress enacted this. There was a gap in

the authority to lease for these types of purposes at 

the time this was enacted.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And why didn't --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, even if -- if I may 

have just one minute, Justice Souter.

 If you get revenue from the natural 

resources, why isn't that a public, religious, 

educational purpose? They get revenue from leasing.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: The -- the example would be 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just -- I just think you 

give too cramped a reading to section 5.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well, the example would be, 

if you -- for example, if you were going to use water --

this is a Navajo reservation -- if you needed water for 

a business and sink a well, you would be utilizing or 

developing the natural resources in connection with a 

surface lease. But -- but the last section of -- the 

last sentence of section 5 says, "Nothing in this 

section shall be construed to repeal or affect the 

authority under other provisions." And it's the other 

provision that is IMLA. The regulations --

JUSTICE SOUTER: May I just supplement 

Justice Kennedy's question? Why can't the development 

of the mineral leases be regarded as an adjunct to a

business enterprise?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean business purposes. 

I --

GEN. KNEEDLER: I -- I suppose they could, 

but in -- in the terminology, mineral leasing, as we 

explain in our brief -- that the categories of leasing 

that are -- have always been handled differently. 

"Mineral leasing" is the term that is used for minerals. 

Business, grazing, farming -- we explain this in our 

brief, that those are different. The regulations that 

were utilized to implement section 5 had never included 

specific provisions for mineral leases. They have 

always been under other -- other provisions.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Do the regs specifically 

address the scope of business purposes?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: They -- they -- not beyond 

basically repeating them, but the -- but they, for 

example, talk about rental value, which is not the way 

you describe mineral leases, which are -- which are 

royalties, not rental value.

 If I could also address the argument about 

sections (b) and (c), sections (b) and (c) of this Act 

provide -- first of all, were enacted after section (a), 

so I don't think much of an inference could be drawn.

But there are situations -- special types of conveyances 

that the tribe was going to make: One was for fee land 

that it was -- that it was transferring. There would be 

no reason to think the United States should be liable 

for that, for what it did with the tribe did with its 

own fee land, and Congress wanted to make sure of that. 

The other was that the tribe could convey trust land to 

municipalities and that sort of thing, and what the 

statute says thereafter the United States won't be 

liable. The United States was just making sure it was 

washing its hands of it.

 Under section (a), we aren't saying that 

there could be no lease under which it could conceivably 

be for a business purpose in which the United States 

could be liable. If there was a regulation establishing 

a minimum floor and the lease terms went below that, 

then that might be a circumstance in which liability 

could be imposed.

 But otherwise, Justice Breyer is completely 

correct: This statute on its face imposes no more of a 

duty on the Secretary with respect to the approval of 

whatever leases are covered than IMLA imposed on the 

Secretary with with respect to -- with respect to 

mineral leases.

 And -- and another important point is, as

this Court pointed out in the Cotton Petroleum and 

Montana v. Blackfeet Tribe, the IMLA was enacted to 

bring uniformity to mineral leasing. And the notion 

that Congress would have implicitly wanted to 

specifically carve the Navajo and Hopi out of that 

general authorization and that preexisting set of 

regulations and cover it by -- by a provision like this 

we think is just not consistent with the way Congress 

has dealt with mineral leases over the -- over the 

years.

 I also just wanted to come back to this idea 

of -- of imposing liability on the basis of the common 

law, because the example of what the Federal Circuit did 

in this case, with all respect to that court, we think 

strayed so far from what this Court laid down in Navajo 

I, that it's important for this Court, however it thinks 

it disposed of this case before, to make clear that 

liability cannot be imposed unless, as this Court said 

in Navajo, there is -- there is a specific 

rights-creating or duty-imposing language in the statute 

itself. The theory that has been adopted in some lower 

courts -- Federal circuit court decisions, which you can 

look at -- a hodgepodge of statutes, one dealing with 

environmental concerns, one dealing with rights-of-way, 

one dealing with this -- add them all up and say the

United States has control and, therefore, out of that 

sort of bucket of statutes, you can impose trust 

responsibilities. That's fundamentally inconsistent 

with the Tucker Act, which requires that the liability 

be based on the statutes themselves, and you have to 

look at each statute and each regulation that governs 

the United States in Indian affairs in the same way, 

under the Tucker Act, you would look at the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: General Kneedler --

GEN. KNEEDLER: -- United States elsewhere 

to decide whether it was --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask one question? I 

probably should have asked earlier. But there is no 

dispute as the case comes to us. I know the government 

has taken the position that there was no breach of 

trust. But do we -- we do have to decide it on the 

assumption that there was a breach of trust that caused 

all this damage?

 GEN. KNEEDLER: No, no. I think that's not 

at all correct. With respect to the approval of the 

lease terms in 1987 -- under a provision that provided 

for "reasonable" lease adjustments, the Secretary 

approved leases negotiated by the tribe at 12.5 percent. 

The tribe entered into two other leases at the very same 

time, although not the subject of this case, for 12.5

percent. That's the standard royalty rate. And the 

tribe got other benefits from this as a package. With 

respect to the arguments about what the Secretary did on 

-- on appeal, it's even clearer that all this 

information about the Secretary meeting with Peabody's 

lobbyist, it was before the Court before, and the Court 

found no violation of any statute or regulation. But 

it's even clearer on remand, as we point out on page 22 

of our reply brief, that the tribe was fully aware that 

the Secretary was not going to -- had -- had said the 

appeal was not going to be acted on and had sent the 

parties back to negotiations. In fact, when Chairman 

Zah of the tribe opened the negotiations on August 30 of 

1985, he said, "It appears that the Secretary wants us 

to take another shot at negotiating the lease." He knew 

what --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure that's 

responsive to justice Stevens's question. I mean, you 

are arguing the merits, but those haven't been decided.

 GEN. KNEEDLER: Well, what the -- what the 

Court of Federal Claims said along those lines was a 

legal conclusion, not a factual conclusion. And the --

the facts as described are really what they were before 

when the Court found no violation.

 And -- and as we say, it's clear factually

on remand that the tribe knew. But again, that was just 

-- it's not a factual determination that has to be taken 

as true. For one thing, it was summary judgment, not 

factual findings. But it does -- it was just a legal 

conclusion. And at that, it was the sort of legal 

conclusion drawn from general notions of fiduciary 

responsibility, nothing that has been channeled or 

embodied or codified in a statute or regulation.

 And we think to unleash the law to regulate 

the day-to-day operations of a vast agency, like the 

Interior Department, which has to operate by statutes 

and regulations would be -- under Vermont Yankee and 

this Court's other jurisprudence, would be -- would be 

unwarranted for the courts to do and especially in a 

waiver of sovereign immunity under the -- under the 

Tucker Act to impose damages liability for the violation 

of a procedural regulation. And, of course, the Court 

pointed out the last time that there was no prohibition 

against ex parte contracts for this sort of informal 

adjudication, as there isn't across -- across the board 

for government -- government activities.

 If there are no further questions --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, general, 

the case is submitted.
