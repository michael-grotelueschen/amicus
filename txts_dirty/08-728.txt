 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-728, Bloate v. United States.

 Mr. Stancil.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK K. STANCIL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. STANCIL: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Pretrial motion preparation time is not 

automatically excluded under Section 3161(h)(1) of the 

Speedy Trial Act. Such delays are subject to exclusion 

only on a case-by-case basis under (h)(7).

 I would like to focus today on three 

features of the statutory text that make that abundantly 

clear. First and foremost, when crafting (h)(1) 

Congress specifically addressed pretrial motion delays 

and precisely defined that exclusion. Subparagraph (D) 

declares that the exclusion shall begin with the filing 

of the motion and end with the hearing on or other 

prompt disposition of the motion.

 Reading the general language in (h)(1) to 

encompass preparation time would circumvent the 

deliberate legislative choice to limit the pretrial 

motion exclusion.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would allow the 

prosecutor's time to be excluded, right? On your theory 

that it starts -- the trigger is the filing of the 

motion, and it ends when the motion is disposed of. So 

the prosecutor might say, I need additional time, and 

that would be included in the suspension period, right?

 MR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor. The 

government's motions and the defense motions are treated 

equally under (h)(1), which is why the government's rule 

to treat defense motions, or defense requests for 

additional time differently --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But I'm --

MR. STANCIL: The exclusion -- I'm sorry, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. STANCIL: The exclusion begins with the 

filing of the motion, be it the defense motion or the 

government's motion. That is clear on the text, the 

face of the text of the statute, which --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the clock -- the 

clock would run, on your theory, during the preparation 

time of the defendant. It would not run during the 

preparation time of the prosecutor. So I don't think 

they are being treated the same.

 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor, that is not

our position. The clock runs up until the moment of 

filing.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Right.

 MR. STANCIL: Whether it is a defense motion 

or a government motion. So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, no. I'm talking 

about the prosecutor's answer to the defense motion.

 MR. STANCIL: Oh, yes, Your Honor. Their 

response to the motion, it is tolled -- or the clock 

stops during the preparation of the response by either 

side. And that was a deliberate legislative choice by 

Congress. It says -- on the face of (h)(1), it says the 

clock stops at filing and remains stopped through the 

conclusion of the hearing or other prompt disposition of 

the motion.

 That was an express choice by Congress. It 

was not lost on them that a response time would be 

treated differently. And the government's suggestion 

that that, therefore, means we should factor back in 

preparation time is --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Shouldn't we be 

looking --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: One point that I would 

like you to clarify. I -- I understand you to take the 

position that the interest of justice would be the route

to take, where the judge would have to stop and make a 

finding. In your view, would it be appropriate, 

assuming your interpretation of (B)(i) holds, for us to 

send the case back, or is it too late, because the 

interest of justice finding was never made?

 MR. STANCIL: It is too late because this 

Court answered that question -- that very question in 

Zedner and held that an (h)(7) ends of justice finding 

cannot be supplied retrospectively on remand. That was 

the precise question put to this Court and it was 

rejected by the Court unanimously.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you think it could be 

found. If it doesn't have to be found on the spot by 

the judge, when is the latest time the judge could make 

the interest of justice filing?

 MR. STANCIL: Zedner says that as long as it 

is made -- or the latest it could be made is the time by 

which the district court rules on the motion to dismiss 

on speedy trial -- on speedy trial grounds. So it can 

be made in the district court up until the time the 

district court decides the speedy trial motion. It does 

not -- at least it is left open in Zedner.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So the result in your 

case would be that the case is dismissed, period.

 MR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor. It would be

-- it would be remanded with instructions to dismiss. 

However, the district court -- it remains for the 

district court to determine whether to dismiss with or 

without prejudice according to the factors specified in 

the act.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Is it clear that a period of 

time attributable to a defense request for time to 

prepare pretrial motions can fall within (h)(7)? 

Because (h)(7) speaks of a continuance. Isn't that a 

very -- wouldn't that be a very odd use of the word 

"continuance"?

 If you make an application to a judge for 

time, additional time to prepare pretrial motions, do 

you say, "I want a continuance of the date on which my 

pretrial motions are due"?

 MR. STANCIL: I think that's not an unusual 

reading of the term "continuance," yes, Your Honor. I 

think they frequently -- trial counsel will frequently 

ask for a continuance of the date. But what I think 

both parties agree is that that is how the courts almost 

universally interpret (h)(7), that any time that is 

excluded, even if it doesn't result in the moving of the 

trial date per se, is treated as an (h)(7) exclusion.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, there's -- but the 

courts of appeals have almost universally read

(h)(1)(D), or overwhelmingly read (h)(1)(D) to apply in 

this situation as well.

 I'm sorry. Not (h)(1)(D), but the 

introductory phrase.

 MR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor, but this rule 

wasn't confined to pretrial motions. So even in those 

jurisdictions that follow the majority position at issue 

here, also to my understanding use (h)(7) to exclude 

intermediate delays before trial. In fact, in the 

government's brief, the government acknowledges that 

courts treat pretrial motion delays under either (h)(1) 

or (h)(7), and more specifically (h)7)(B)(iv), which 

specifically speaks in terms of preparation. And in 

fact, that's still further evidence that Congress 

specifically contemplated that preparation time would go 

under (h)(7). Both (h)(7)(B)(ii) and (h)(7)(B)(iv) 

specifically direct district courts to consider the need 

for additional time for adequate or effective 

preparation.

 And Justice Alito, back to your concern 

specifically with motions. (B)(ii) specifically refers 

to pretrial proceedings. So I think there, in that 

sense, there is evidence that Congress didn't think that 

a continuance under (h)(7) would refer only to a 

continuance of the trial date. At least, that's --

that's my understanding.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, at the time 

that (h)(1)(C) -- or (D) was being looked at, wasn't it 

a fact that some circuits had reviewed the prior 

exclusion as applying only to the date in which there 

were actual hearings before the court?

 MR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So isn't it -- shouldn't 

we be looking at what you did with respect to this time 

period in light of the need that it was addressing?

 MR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor. And the 

Court -- and Congress did decide to expand or clarify 

the end point and beginning point of the (h)(1)(D) 

exclusion.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, what's wrong with 

the logic of district courts who have ruled in this --

in the government's favor, that say Congress was only 

looking at that particular part of the proceeding --

what related to the hearing, the filing of the motion, 

its actual adjudication -- but they weren't considering 

a motion by the defendant for time to investigate, and 

that can be another proceeding?

 Can you imagine a situation in which a court 

grants that adjournment to a defense attorney where we 

would reverse that finding by the court?

MR. STANCIL: I'm sorry, Your Honor? 

Reverse --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- it would seem to 

me that if a defense attorney comes to a court and says, 

I need an adjournment, and the Court says, you can have 

it, isn't that implicitly a proceeding in which the 

court is saying there is a need for this?

 MR. STANCIL: Not in a speedy trial context, 

Your Honor, for two reasons. First, it is not a 

proceeding. There is no pretrial proceeding until the 

motion is filed. That is -- that is the definition of a 

pretrial motion proceeding. It is a formal initiation 

before the district court.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: "Proceeding" doesn't 

mean an act -- it is an act before the court. The 

entire action is before the court. But it is a 

proceeding in which the defense attorney is looking at 

whether there's anything to file motions about.

 MR. STANCIL: If that were correct, Your 

Honor, then preparing your witnesses is a proceeding 

respecting trial. I think that takes "proceeding" and 

expands it so that everything would be excludable delay.

 But if -- if I may return to your original 

question, Congress did look at preparation time when 

drafting (h)(1) and (h)(1)B) specifically --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, the Senate did.

 MR. STANCIL: Pardon me. Yes, the Senate 

Judiciary Committee specifically considered a proposal 

by the government no less to include preparation time, 

and the committee rejected that proposal as 

unreasonable. I think this is simply not a case in 

which we are left to guess whether preparation time was 

on the table. It was on the table and it was declared 

unreasonable to suggest that it would be within the 

automatic exclusion.

 Moreover, I think that makes abundant sense. 

It is not the case that simply asking for more time 

necessarily means that you have some prejudice in the 

speedy trial context, or even that the trial date 

necessarily would move. In this case, the counsel 

requested the extension for pretrial motions. That 

extension was granted. The trial date held. It wasn't 

moved until much later, under an (h)(7) exclusion on 

unrelated grounds. So I think it's a -- I think it's a 

false -- a red herring, if you will, for the government 

to suggest that when the defendant asks for something, 

it's necessarily -- it ought to be granted, fair enough, 

but that it's necessarily going to prejudice the speedy 

trial calculation.

 With respect, I don't think that's the case.

I think ordinarily, these things will come very early in 

the speedy trial -- speedy trial clock, and there will 

be relatively brief delays. And so I think it's quite 

reasonable to think that district courts could be 

allowed to give more flexible preparation time to decide 

whether to file, what to file, and then the exclusion 

starts with the filing. And I think Congress has made 

that abundantly clear in -- on the text of the statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That would certainly 

encourage judges who don't want to get involved with 

making findings, which you have to do to satisfy 

interest of justice, to just say: Motion denied; I'm 

sorry, I'm not going to let you have the clock run while 

you -- you are asking me for a favor. You want time to 

prepare, and the clock is going to run in the meantime. 

Forget it. You are not going to get the extension.

 MR. STANCIL: I disagree, Your Honor.

 First, I think courts will granted them when 

necessary. Again because it is early in the clock, 

there won't necessarily be speedy trial -- some sort of 

speedy prejudice to the government. But moreover, all 

this means is that the court needs to put findings on 

the record to say this is preparation time that is 

legitimately needed, the defendant's interests here 

outweigh the public's interest, and so I'm going to

grant that and I'm going to put those findings on the 

record. And I think it's clear from the statute that 

that's how Congress anticipated this would work. But 

I --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What must the judge --

the judge must make a finding orally or in writing. Can 

it just say, okay, I'm giving it to you in the interest 

of justice?

 MR. STANCIL: I think -- I don't believe 

that precise question has come to the Court. But courts 

are very permissive in terms of how much needs to be put 

on the record, and it's my understanding that this 

happens quite literally every day in scores of contexts 

where courts, as long as they make the finding, it is 

reviewed for an abuse of discretion only and that's 

sufficient.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So the rule that you are 

arguing for really will accomplish nothing, other than 

to benefit a small set of defendants who -- who got 

pretrial preparation time in reliance on court of 

appeals decisions saying that those could be done 

without making explicit ends of justice findings on the 

record?

 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. If we are 

correct, the decision will have significant effect on

the public's interest. In fact, an individual defendant 

has very little to gain from such gamesmanship as the 

government suggests would be at issue. What you get is 

a dismissal of your indictment with or without 

prejudice, and there are no statute of limitations 

problems --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, how is the public 

going to benefit if all the judge needs -- presumably, 

district judges are not granting these extensions of 

time in situations in which they do not think that the 

ends of justice are served by granting the extension of 

time.

 So what is going to be served by requiring 

them to recite this -- to make this rote recitation on 

the record?

 MR. STANCIL: First, Your Honor, it's not 

rote. It specifies four factors that they have to 

consider, including and before, it says, whether its 

time -- the time is necessary for effective preparation, 

taking into account the exercise of due diligence.

 What this -- what putting this under (h)(7) 

and making that process required will do is weed out the 

very worst sorts of delays where counsel, even for the 

defendant or the government, comes in and asks for the 

delay without the exercise of due diligence and without

any showing that this is actually necessary. And I 

think that's exactly what Congress was doing by not 

putting this under the automatic exclusion in (h)(1).

 If it's automatically excluded, and there is 

additional time granted for no reason whatsoever or for 

something that wouldn't meet the due diligence standard 

in (B)(iv), the speedy trial clock is effectively 

lengthened automatically.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you tell me how it 

works in district courts? This district court set 

September 13 originally for the -- for the motion. Do 

the district courts generally have a custom schedule for 

every case where they set times or do they have local 

rules on the subject?

 MR. STANCIL: With respect to pretrial 

motions specifically?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 MR. STANCIL: It varies widely from district 

to district. For example, in some districts the default 

is 21 days. So, if you try a case in Chicago, you go to 

arraignment, your pretrial motions, unless set by a 

different rule, are due in 21 --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And that's -- that's part 

of -- that there in the local rule of court?

 MR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor. In D.C., it

is 11 days. In many other jurisdictions and here, there 

is no set time limit.

 And one of the problems -- one of the 

fundamental problems with the government's rule that a 

request -- a defense request for additional time must be 

treated differently and does stop the clock, is that 

gives speedy trial consequences to those variations in 

local rules. So, in districts where you have a very 

short standard timeframe, the defendant has to run in, 

if he wants to file pretrial motions, and stop the clock 

almost automatically. If you have -- say, your motions 

are due automatically in seven days; you have got to run 

in there and stop the clock.

 As a practical matter, the speedy trial, the 

70 days, it's that much longer in those districts 

because you have got to stop the clock compared to 

districts where, say, 21 days are ordinarily allotted. 

Well, they may not have to stop the clock. It's clear 

that Congress did not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I'm -- I'm not sure 

that that isn't -- that that argument doesn't cut both 

ways.

 MR. STANCIL: I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure if that -- if 

you have a district where you have five days, a very

short period and almost nobody can comply with it, then 

maybe that's an argument for the government's rule.

 MR. STANCIL: I disagree, Your Honor. I 

think that illustrates the problem, because if there is 

a -- call it an unreasonably short time period in this 

district, the speedy trial clock only burns for four or 

five days or a week, and then someone is going to have 

to run in and stop it. So those trials are just going 

to take longer.

 Let's assume that it takes two weeks on 

average or three weeks on average to prepare a 

reasonable pretrial motion. Well, in those 

jurisdictions that have that local rule, the short local 

rule, you get two extra weeks on the speedy trial clock, 

because you have to run in and hit stop on the clock by 

asking for additional time.

 In those districts that give you 21 days by 

default, by contrast, that whole 21 days counts against 

the 70 days. And that is, I think -- I think that is an 

essential judgment that Congress made. It decided on 70 

days --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think an 

assumption in your mathematical analysis is that there 

will be a difference in the time that it takes to 

dispose of the motion. If the time to dispose of the

motion is the same, then you are wrong, I think. I will 

work it out.

 MR. STANCIL: I don't believe so, Your 

Honor. If you assume hypothetically 21 days to prepare 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.

 MR. STANCIL: -- 21 days to respond and call 

it 21 days to rule --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.

 MR. STANCIL: -- in a district that allows 

21 days of preparation time by default rule, 21 days 

will burn and then 42 days with response and ruling.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Right.

 MR. STANCIL: In a district that allows only 

five days, five days burn, and then you have to stop the 

clock for the additional 16 days of preparation, plus 

21, plus 21. You end up effectively, if the difference 

is 5 days or 21 days, there is an 86-day speedy trial 

clock in the district with the short rule and a 70-day 

speedy trial clock in the district with the local 

rule -- with the 21-day rule.

 And so I think it's -- and it's clear that 

what Congress did not want in the Speedy Trial Act was 

these time periods to be amended by local rule 

effectively. And that's what would happen. I think

more fundamentally --

JUSTICE ALITO: Where does that show, 

because the disposition time isn't going to be the same 

from district to district? Districts vary.

 MR. STANCIL: That's correct.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Congress could have 

required, as they have in some instances, to have a 

judge decide a matter within a certain period of time. 

They didn't do that, did they?

 MR. STANCIL: That's not correct, Your 

Honor. In subparagraph (H), 3161(h)(1)(H) allows only 

30 days during which a matter is actively under --

actually under advisement by the district court. So 

here they actual did set a 30-day clock on which to 

rule.

 There is an exception to that. If there is 

a hearing subparagraph (D) says, well, you know, we are 

not going to govern the time in the hearing, and this 

Court's in Henderson gives district courts flexibility 

in that regard, when there is a hearing. But Congress 

was pretty clear in trying to put a book end at either 

end. It starts on filing and it ends with disposition, 

and we only give you 30 days without a hearing or after 

the hearing to dispose of it.

 And I think more fundamentally this is a

quintessentially legislative judgment. Congress said, 

this is a system of rules that we need in place to move 

cases more expeditiously toward trial. We are going to 

give you 70 days. We are going to exclude certain 

things automatically, and we are going to give district 

courts flexibility under (h)(7).

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could a district 

judge, as part of his normal pretrial order, say that I 

am inclined to grant normal motions for extensions, but 

I think so we don't run into these problems that it's in 

the best interest of justice that whatever time I grant, 

I issue an order covered by (h)(7)(A)? That avoids all 

this problem. I don't have to worry about the Speedy 

Trial Act when I grant you a motion, because whatever I 

grant you is going to be excluded under (h)(7)(A).

 MR. STANCIL: I don't -- that sounds a lot 

like a prospective waiver of speedy trial, which is --

this court rejected in Zedner. If I understand the 

hypothetical correctly, if the district court says if I 

give you extra time, we are not going to complain about 

it later. I don't think that the court could do that, 

and I don't think that would be consistent --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But presumably, a 

judge can do it in every case. You are saying they 

can't tell you in advance this is what they are going to

do, but they can do it automatically in every case?

 MR. STANCIL: I don't believe so, Your 

Honor. I think, if I understand the hypothetical 

correctly, if a -- if we appear before the district 

judge and the judge says exclusions or extensions for 

pretrial motions will qualify for (h)(7), that sounds 

like to me in an individual case a prospective waiver of 

that defendant's Speedy Trial Act --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Wait a minute. If a 

defense attorney comes in to you and says -- I'm a 

district court judge -- I need time to prepare; granted, 

I am excluding time under (7)(A). You are saying that 

is insufficient?

 MR. STANCIL: No, Your Honor. If it's done 

on a case-by-case basis, where the time is requested and 

the continuance or the delay is granted with the (h)(7) 

findings made either then or later, that would be 

perfectly appropriate. That's how Congress --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But it's not okay for a 

district court to say, you tell me how much or you have 

21 days to prepare motions and I'm excluding time 

because of that?

 MR. STANCIL: No. I'm not sure I -- I 

apologize. I'm not sure I under --

district court judge: Defendant is arraigned; you have 

21 days to file motions.

 MR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor. That is --

that time is not excluded if it is just set by local 

rule.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you finish 

answering one earlier question. You said that there is 

no statute of limitations problems if we rule in your 

favor. Could you explain why?

 MR. STANCIL: Yes. Under 18 U.S.C., I 

believe it's 3288 and 3289, essentially gives the 

government six months after the dismissal of an 

indictment to reindict a defendant. And courts have 

almost universally held that that applies -- or I 

believe it's universally held that that applies where 

the dismissal is based on Speedy Trial Act grounds. I 

think we are in agreement with the government that there 

is not a statute of limitations problem.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could under that retrial 

provision the court begin excluding time?

 MR. STANCIL: The speedy trial clock starts 

anew after a new --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what I mean.

 MR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor. That is 

clear under the statute.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any idea how 

many convictions would be at risk for reversal under 

this rule, that would be currently pending and subject 

to a ruling in your favor now?

 MR. STANCIL: I don't know. My supposition 

is that it's not very many. The government certainly 

hasn't suggested that there are a lot. It would have to 

be cases within those eight districts or -- pardon me --

I guess it would be nine or ten, that have either not 

taken a position or take the government's position, in 

which the defendant raised this argument in the trial 

court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In a timely manner.

 MR. STANCIL: -- in a timely manner. So I 

think if that is the case, it's an exceedingly small 

number, and for that matter, that would be a problem in 

any case in which this Court reverses an incorrect 

ruling.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is -- is there any 

indication in the circuits that follow what seems to be 

the majority rule -- that is that the clock is stopped 

during preparation time -- that there have been 

excessive delays, in comparison to the -- what is it, 

two circuits who go the other way?

Honor, but nor has there been any indication that 

district courts in the two jurisdiction where they get 

the rule right in our view deny defense requests for 

additional time.

 I think -- I think this rule will matter if 

you assume that the average pretrial motion extension is 

relatively modest and that the lawyers are fairly 

reasonable in what they request. We are talking about, 

you know, additional delays of a week or two weeks, but 

that is -- again, that backs right up into the 

congressional judgment, the legislative judgment that 

Congress made.

 And so those trials will on average in the 

majority of jurisdictions, I think, just take that much 

longer to get to trial.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what is your 

systemic concern with the -- with the government's rule? 

The judge has to grant the continuance under either --

under either of your rules, and you say he has to make a 

finding that it's good. But are you concerned the 

continuance would be because the attorney wants to play 

golf or take a vacation with his kids, and that that's 

not the cause?

 MR. STANCIL: Well, that --

your concern?

 MR. STANCIL: Well, that would be -- that is 

the most important function of (h)(7), to screen out the 

truly unmeritorious delays. That's what Congress wanted 

to get at most of all.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But wouldn't judges in 

many cases do that anyway just in the course of deciding 

whether to grant a continuance?

 MR. STANCIL: The court may --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Give -- give me the 

consequences of ruling for the government that you see 

that are adverse in your view.

 MR. STANCIL: The consequence -- ruling for 

the government would mean that any time a defendant 

needs any extra time, or -- or we would say either side 

needs any extra time, the clock stops. And so any time 

you need additional time for pretrial motions there is 

no balancing.

 So in the routine case that is not complex, 

where the -- where the defendant's counsel may be just 

simply not exercising due diligence, you could ask for 

two weeks and there is no -- there is no balancing. The 

district court doesn't even have to ask, what's the 

delay, you know, why the extra delay? And that time is 

automatically excluded.

MR. STANCIL: In the absence --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Or do you doubt that?

 MR. STANCIL: I am sure it will vary from 

court to court. But in the absence of (h)(7) and 

putting it on the record, the district court is 

certainly not required to ask and may not -- certainly 

won't put those findings on the record. And I think 

this Court made that point very clear in Zedner, that 

(h)(7) balances substantive open-endedness with 

procedural strictness, and the procedure is what 

matters, and Congress made that explicitly clear in 

drafting (h)(7).

 If I may, I would like to reserve the 

remainder of my time for rebuttal.

 Mr. Roberts.

pretrial motions is automatically excluded from the 

Speedy Trial Act deadline for commencing trial. For 

three reasons, that time falls under section 3161(h)(1) 

which excludes delay resulting from other proceedings 

concerning the defendant.

 First, Section (h)(1) excludes delay 

resulting from various listed proceedings and other 

proceedings that are analogous or ancillary to those 

proceedings. A court's grant of additional motions 

preparation time is ancillary to pretrial motions 

themselves, which are a listed proceeding. It 

facilitates the motions because adequate time to prepare 

them is critical to their fair and accurate resolution. 

The exclusion is similar to other excludable delays that 

result from proceedings ancillary to listed proceedings.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could I ask a 

specific date question? Am I right that you would 

exclude the time from September 7th to October 4th?

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, the time from 

September 7th to October 4th.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that 

doesn't -- I'm not sure that makes much sense. Before 

the motion for extension was filed, the hearing date for 

pretrial motions was September 20. After the extension 

was filed and granted, the hearing date was October 4th.

So the only period of delay that you could say resulted 

from the extension was from September 20 to October 4, 

or 13 days.

 Well, how can you possibly count the time as 

a delay after he filed his extension up to the point 

when things would have been due anyway?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, the delay is just the 

time that's being used for preparation, which was 

presumably the time all the way up to the period at 

which the waiver of the intent to file motions was 

filed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but how is 

that a -- how is the time being spent for preparation a 

delay, when some of that time was going to be allowed 

anyway?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think the act --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, the 

motions were not due until September 25th. So I don't 

see how the time he spent before then can be regarded as 

a delay.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, that's -- that's a 

result of the fact that the act doesn't exclude the time 

before a routine deadline for filing the motion, because 

it only excludes the time -- the delay resulting from an 

individualized proceeding. But it makes sense not to

exclude the -- the time before the routine deadline as a 

general matter, because if you excluded all that time, 

then you -- the result would be that the basic deadline 

of the act would be extended and time would be excluded 

in cases where no time was being used for consideration 

or preparation of pretrial motions. But once you 

know --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the -- what 

is the proceeding from which you count in determining 

what should be excluded?

 MR. ROBERTS: The time running from the 

order of the district court granting additional time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, that order --

that proceeding was initiated and ruled on the same day. 

The person comes in and says: I would like time. The 

judge that same day says yes.

 MR. ROBERTS: There were --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That proceeding 

takes a day.

 MR. ROBERTS: The request -- the request for 

time, that proceeding was done. But the order -- the 

order granting additional time is a proceeding, and the 

additional time that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The additional time 

flowing from the order is a proceeding?

excludes delay resulting from any proceeding to 

determine mental competency. Okay?

competency, right?

from the filing of a motion seeking an examination, yes. 

You could also, that would probably be excluded under

(h)(4) excludes any period of delay resulting from the 

fact that the defendant is -- is mentally incompetent.

 MR. ROBERTS: Right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It seems to me 

redundant if you exclude the delay from the examination 

and then also exclude mental incompetence.

 MR. ROBERTS: I don't think so, Your Honor, 

because the delay resulting from the examination would 

-- would be excluded from the order granting the 

examination until the examination was complete. And 

then there would be a determination of competence or 

incompetence.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: All right. Well, 

let's look at (h)(1)(G). That excludes delay resulting 

from consideration by the court of a proposed plea 

agreement. But then (h)(2) says any period of delay in 

which prosecution is deferred pursuant to a written --

written agreement with the defendant, for the purpose of 

allowing the defendant to demonstrate his good conduct, 

which sounds an awful lot like a plea agreement to me.

 MR. ROBERTS: I don't -- I think that 

that's -- that that's a different -- a different 

deferral, Your Honor. It's not for the court's 

consideration of a plea agreement or even for 

negotiations. It's saying we're going to take time out

so that the defendant can demonstrate his -- his good 

conduct.

 I think that the plea agreement provision is 

once the parties have proposed an agreement to the 

court, the court has time to consider whether it should 

approve that and that time's excluded. And in fact 

courts have excluded the time that the parties are 

engaged in plea negotiations as ancillary to that 

provision of consideration of the proposed plea 

agreement.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I disagree with 

you that, when the time that is extended before a 

hearing on the pretrial motions and the acceptance of a 

waiver, which runs from 13 days, September 20, the 

original date, and the date that it actually took place, 

which is 13 days, and if I think, contrary to your 

submission, which is that the whole time from the filing 

of the extension to the final hearing is delay, even 

though it was only 13 days that was pushed back, then 

you lose, right?

 MR. ROBERTS: I'm not sure. If you think 

that the -- that there's delay that results from the 

grant of the extension, I don't think that the 

Petitioners ever challenged the length of the delay that 

was excluded, so the only issue that's before the Court

is whether that delay is excluded.

 I don't know that the Petitioners preserved 

any argument about the length of the delay, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Putting aside what 

Petitioners may or may not have argued, if I think that 

the delay is only how far the date for consideration of 

a motion and acting on the motion has been moved -- in 

this case, from September 20 to October 4; in other 

words, it's 13 days, not 28 days -- then you lose, 

right?

 MR. ROBERTS: I'm not sure that we lose. I 

have to confess that I haven't calculated the -- the 

exact amount of time that that results. In any case, 

there are other periods of delays --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I guess it 

would be, take 15 days from what time you have 

calculated, and that's -- that's under the wire -- or is 

it above the wire?

 MR. ROBERTS: Yeah. I'm sorry, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In other words, I am 

contesting 15 of your days, and you figured out how much 

days you think can be excluded or not excluded.

 MR. ROBERTS: Right. I guess I would say, 

if there was some question about the length of delay, 

the appropriate thing would be to -- to rule for us on

the issue that's before the Court, remand to the courts 

below, allow them to decide whether the Petitioners 

preserved the question about the length of delay and 

what the effect is on a rule that would only limit the 

additional delay.

 You know, we also have other arguments for 

the fact that we think that, even if this time isn't 

excluded, that, based on -- based on the additional 

preparation time, that there's still no Speedy Trial Act 

here, that we raised in the -- in the brief of -- in 

opposition, and we would think that that should be taken 

into account on any remand like that as well.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was -- what was the 

second point you just made, Mr. Roberts? That, even if 

the clock is running, you would still have an argument 

that you come within the 70 days because?

 MR. ROBERTS: Because the -- on 

September 25th, Petitioner filed a notice of intent to 

waive pretrial motions, and then there was a hearing on 

that on the 4th, and so that filing would be analogous 

to a motion or a motion that would trigger it's own 

delay, that it would trigger it's own exclusion of time 

even if the time starting on September 7th was not 

excluded.

information, what's a motion to -- to waive? I mean, 

why does he need permission to waive?

 MR. ROBERTS: The -- the court had 

originally said -- the court had originally provided in 

its order that on the deadline for filing motions the --

the Petitioner should either file the motions or 

indicate whether he wanted to waive the motions and then 

set a hearing on either one, on the 4th, and that's what 

happened.

 After he filed that paper on the 4th, the 

court held a hearing, and the defendant -- discussed 

with the defendant personally whether he wanted to waive 

his right to file motions.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I see.

 MR. ROBERTS: And the defendant waived his 

right to file motions, which had a consequence, you 

know, in the case.

 The second reason that the additional time 

granted for preparation of pretrial motions is 

automatically excluded is that the exclusion in Section 

(h)(1)(D) for delay resulting from pretrial motions 

themselves excludes the time that a court grants the 

non-moving party to prepare a response.

 And, as Justice Ginsburg, in her questions 

suggested, it would make little sense automatically to

exclude time granted to respond to motions, but not the 

time granted for the specific purpose of preparing them.

 In fact, this Court employed similar 

reasoning to that in the Henderson case when it held 

that the Act excludes the time after a court has held a 

hearing on a motion while the court's awaiting further 

written submissions.

 The Court reasoned that it would make no 

sense not to exclude that time because the act excludes 

all the time before the hearing, as well as 30 days 

after a motion's taken under advisement; and likewise it 

would make no sense not to exclude time that is 

specifically granted to prepare motions when the Court 

excludes the time granted to respond to them.

 Third --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Except for the -- for the 

language, which -- which says that you -- you time it 

from the beginning of the time granted.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, section -- Section 

(h)(1), Your Honor, expressly states that it excludes 

delays, including, but not limited, to the listed 

delays, so no negative inference arises from the fact 

that the listed examples don't specifically address 

delays resulting from the grant of additional motions 

preparation time.

Section (h)(1)(D) is addressing a related, 

but different delay, the delay from the pretrial motion 

itself.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, what's the effect of 

that language then? Why didn't (D) just read "delay 

resulting from any pretrial motion"?

 MR. ROBERTS: Because Congress specifically 

amended it in 1979, in response to previous 

interpretations by some courts that had excluded only 

the time that was spent in actual court hearings, and 

the language makes clear that all the time from the 

filing of the motion through the hearings, including 

the -- not just the Court hearing time -- is excluded, 

and it -- the language continues to -- to make that 

clear, even if preparation time is also sometimes 

excluded.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, do you disagree 

with your adversary, that there is no statute of 

limitations problem if we rule against you?

 MR. ROBERTS: No. I don't think that there 

are statute of limitations problems, Your Honor, but 

requiring judges to make superfluous ends of justice 

findings --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But is it superfluous? 

Because what your adversary is saying is that Congress

wanted district courts to think about why some things 

were being -- additional time was being requested. Not 

all motions by defendants would a district court 

actually feel were warranted and might say to that 

individual if they came in: Look; that shouldn't take 

you three weeks; that should only take you a week.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, a court should always be 

doing that in considering whether to grant additional 

time that's requested, Your Honor. Neither the 

defendant nor the public is going to have an interest in 

rushing to trial without adequate time to prepare --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that doesn't answer 

my point. Without a requirement that the judge actually 

has to make a finding in the interest of justice, once 

the defense attorney comes in and says, I want a month, 

and isn't the judge required to give him the month 

because it's automatically excludable?

 What, otherwise, forces the judge to look at 

the request and say, no; is it really in the interest of 

justice for me to give you that month?"

 MR. ROBERTS: The -- the judge doesn't have 

to give him the additional time. Presumably, the judge 

should only give him the -- the additional time if more 

time is needed to prepare the -- the motions, based on 

the justification that the defendant --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what -- so what 

additional requirements are we imposing on the judge 

that the statute itself doesn't command?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, what --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If the judge always has 

to listen to the reason, weigh it, determine whether or 

not it is in fact in the interest of justice or not, how 

much more burden are we putting on a judge than to say, 

look, you are right, you need a month; I will exclude it 

under (7)(H).

 MR. ROBERTS: The judge has to specifically 

consider all of the specified factors that are in (b)(1) 

through (4).

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We have never required 

the judge to give a litany of each of the factors under 

(h)(7). We have never required him or her to do a 

detailed finding. We've just required them to say 

there's some reason for it.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, the court -- the statute 

says that the judge shall consider the specific factors, 

and some courts at least have -- have reversed -- if 

a -- situations where the court hasn't considered the 

factors.

 In addition, there have to be specific ends 

of justice findings, which I would respectfully disagree

with counsel on the other side: The findings have to be 

made before the continuance is granted. What --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's what Zedner seems 

to suggest.

 MR. ROBERTS: What Zedner says is the 

findings have to be made before the continuance is 

granted. They can be recorded later, but they have to 

be made, because otherwise the continuance isn't made on 

the basis of the findings. So if the judge didn't go 

through, consider the factors, and make the findings, if 

only in the judge's mind, then the judge shouldn't be 

recording them later on.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Roberts --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And counsel wouldn't know 

until -- wouldn't know whether the time was excluded or 

not until -- until a later finding is either made or not 

made.

 MR. ROBERTS: Is recorded. I guess -- I 

guess not, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you, 

Mr. Roberts, to comment on your opponent's argument that 

you are creating a rule that if a particular district 

has a standing order that motions be filed after seven 

days and then another district has a standing order that 

it be 21 days, the effect of your rule would be to make

the seven-day district an 86-day -- give them 86 days 

under the Speedy Trial Act?

 MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor. The -- the 

act just doesn't operate so that -- so that all the 

districts' excludable delays are even across districts. 

The exclusion in Section (h)(1)(D), the exclusion for 

pretrial motions, excludes the time that's allotted to 

prepare responses. And there is wide variation among 

the different districts in the time that's allotted to 

prepare responses.

 So, for example, the Northern District of 

Florida gives 14 days after the motion. The Northern 

District of Illinois gives ten days after the motion.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That's for response time.

 MR. ROBERTS: For response time.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And that's automatically 

excluded, so that won't affect the -- well, like you 

said, it's --

MR. ROBERTS: It's going to be different.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. ROBERTS: So it's the same -- it's the 

same issue. They're just -- it isn't in lockstep.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But if the difference is 

specifically authorized by Congress?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, this is specifically

authorized by Congress, too, because section (h)(1) is 

-- is a general exclusion for delay resulting from 

proceedings concerning the defendant.

 And, you know, these are -- the list of 

things are examples only. And this covers those 

proceedings and other proceedings, including those that 

like this one that are ancillary to the listed ones.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But doesn't it seem fairly 

clear that the district which has a 21-day rule, they 

won't have to -- normally, they won't need extra time in 

the routine case for an extra motion, whereas the 

districts with a seven-day rule would pretty 

automatically need another 10 days or so.

 MR. ROBERTS: I think it depends on the 

particular case and what motions are in -- or what 

motions are involved, Your Honor.

 But the -- the rule is going to operate 

differentially, too. Under Petitioner's theory, people 

come in asking for different extensions of time to get 

(h)(7) continuances, which Petitioner says are not going 

to be very difficult to get granted. So I think, both 

in terms of the response time varying and in terms of 

the rule having the same effect, whether it's excluded 

under (h)(1) or (h)(7), I'm not sure that you are going 

to ever get a complete parity. That's really not what

Congress was intending.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, this may be 

the same question I was asking earlier, but I want to 

make sure I've got your answer. Let's say the original 

date for filing motions is, as it was here, 

September 13th, right? On September 7th, Mr. Bloate 

asks for additional time. So the judge's, you know, 

runs a tight ship, and he says, I will give you one day. 

One more day, so now it's due on September 14th.

 You would say the delay resulting from that 

extension was seven days, from September 7th, when he 

filed it, to September 14th, and not one day.

 MR. ROBERTS: That's the way the courts have 

interpreted it, because once the -- once the 

determination has been made that there should be time to 

prepare a response, then you know that you're outside of 

the case where you don't know whether any of this time 

in the routine deadline is being used for response --

for consideration of motions or preparation of motions. 

You know that counsel is using time for that purpose.

 But I would say, you know, the same answer 

back to you, that -- that the issue here is whether 

additional time should -- is excluded when it's granted. 

The issue isn't how much time should have been excluded. 

And if -- if the court thinks that an incorrect amount

of time has been -- was calculated as excluded, I think 

that the appropriate thing to do in that circumstance 

would be for the Court to leave that open on remand, 

assuming that it's -- that it's preserved. But, you 

know, I think that -- that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And you would argue it 

wasn't reserved because both sides thought the period 

was from September 7th until October 4th, and one 

thought that that whole period should be excluded? That 

was your position, and then the other side said none of 

it --

MR. ROBERTS: That's right, Your Honor. I 

-- Petitioner never argued, at least as far as I am 

aware, that the error was a miscalculation of the amount 

of time, rather than the exclusion of the time under the 

wrong statutory provision.

 JUSTICE BREYER: How -- how do you think it 

should work? It seems to me they are two separate 

things. On September 7th, the defendant comes in and 

says, "Judge, you've told me I have to have everything 

ready by the 13th. I would like additional time to 

prepare." And what he said was, "until September 25th." 

He said that on the 13th: "I want until 

September 25th." This is what I think the Chief Justice 

is asking, in part.

Now, what the judge did is excluded 

everything from September 7th all the way to 

October 4th. And if I understand your argument -- I'm 

not sure I agree with it, but on the 7th to the 13th, 

that really wasn't additional time, but nonetheless, 

maybe there's something there.

 What about the period from the 25th to the 

4th? I don't know what the theory could be on excluding 

that one, because what the defendant said on the 7th --

on September 13th, he said, "Judge, I don't want any 

more time. I don't even want to file any motions."

 MR. ROBERTS: On the 25th.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. On the 25th, he said 

that. So what is the basis of excluding the 25th to the 

4th?

 MR. ROBERTS: As I was saying before, what 

-- he did make a filing on the 25th, and the Court took 

action in response to that filing on the 4th, by holding 

a hearing at which he waived the motions as he indicated 

that he was doing on the -- on the 25th. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the delay -- so 

saying I'm not going to file any pretrial motions 

results in a delay from a pretrial motion?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, in this particular 

instance, Your Honor, he made a filing and then the

Court -- the Court held a hearing in response to that, 

and actually engaged in a colloquy with the defendant, 

asked the -- asked the defendant, "Do you understand 

what you are giving up? Do you want to waive these 

motions?" He said, "Yes, I want to do that," and the 

Court ruled, then, on that on the 4th.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that a normal course 

of practice? I've never quite heard of other --

MR. ROBERTS: I don't think it's a general 

practice, Your Honor. It does seem to be typical in 

this -- in this district, but I think that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But then the Court's 

view a decision or statement that no motions are going 

to be filed as a request for a waiver of that 

obligation?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, it was in fact a waiver 

notice, a notice of intent to waive, that the defendant 

filed. Not just --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Intent to waive.

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I mean, it was framed as 

a waiver, a waiver of pretrial motions. It's Docket 

Entry 21. But I don't think it's -- you know, it's in 

the record, but not in the -- in the JA.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, I didn't see it as 

a motion. It didn't move to waive. It said, "I waive."

MR. ROBERTS: That -- that's true, but the 

Court didn't -- the Court held the hearing on the 4th. 

And it engaged in this conversation with the defendant 

and then made a decision on the 4th that the time was 

waived, that the -- the waiver, not --

JUSTICE BREYER: So it's --

MR. ROBERTS: Not at the time it was filed.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I understand. 

You get the period from the -- the 25th to the 4th comes 

under (D) or (H). It's a motion that is filed, and it's 

under advisement.

 MR. ROBERTS: I think that the --

JUSTICE BREYER: So it comes under (D) or 

(H). Is that right?

 MR. ROBERTS: It comes under -- it probably 

comes under (h)(1), Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, I don't mean little 

(h)(1). I mean big (H). It's attributed to a period 

during which any proceedings actually under any 

advisement -- or maybe it comes under (D) -- a motion 

not to file a motion is a motion.

 MR. ROBERTS: I mean, it could come under 

(D), Your Honor. It could come under (h)(1). I would 

say it really comes under both -- best fits under (h)(1) 

as analogous to a motion that's not exactly a motion.

But, you know, either way, the point is that 

it was something that the Court required the Court 

action, or at least as the Court had set the rules in 

this proceeding required Court action, and then it did 

ultimately did have Court action on the Court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would you repeat that just 

so I have you: It comes under (h)(1) -- what sub?

 MR. ROBERTS: I think just under -- I would 

say, Your Honor, just under the general language of 

(h)(1), because it's not strictly a pretrial motion, but 

it's the equivalent of a pretrial motion.

 But you could say that it falls under --

under (h)(1)(D), and think of it as a motion itself.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Did --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you have any idea of 

how many, if we rule against you, until we -- speaking 

hypothetically, how many convictions would be at risk 

for --

MR. ROBERTS: I couldn't say precisely, Your 

Honor, but it is the rule that's been followed in eight 

courts of appeals.

true. I mean, I can't say that they are going to be --

and I would have to agree with -- with Petitioner's 

counsel that, you know, that there are consequences in 

whatever ruling that the Court -- that the Court makes 

in a case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I would have been -- I 

would have been interested in knowing the effects of 

Zedner.

 MR. ROBERTS: Yeah.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And how -- what kind of 

burden it placed.

 MR. ROBERTS: I'm sorry, I don't have any

that, you know, even apart from the transitional effects 

that there are going to be on a going-forward basis, 

sometimes judges are going -- would -- would grant 

additional preparation time and neglect to make the 

required finding.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that's true of all 

Speedy Trial Act actions by the district court. They 

always run the risk of forgetting to make a finding. 

That's why you have two attorneys, presumably --

appropriate if findings under (h)(7) were necessary. 

But section (h)(1) is designed to address frequently 

recurring situations in which the ends of justice are 

virtually always going to be served by delaying the 

trial for the purpose. And that's exactly what we have 

here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I ask you about the 

language of (h)(1)? Do you think it's -- do you think 

it's proper to consider a period of delay that precedes 

the filing of the motion? That is, a period of delay in 

order to prepare the motion, as a delay resulting from a 

proceeding that has not yet occurred?

 MR. ROBERTS: No, we -- we agree with that, 

Your Honor. That's why Petitioner is wrong in saying 

that (D) addresses the delay we are talking about here 

and precludes its recognition under -- under (h)(1). 

The delay we are talking about here is not resulting 

from the pretrial motion, it's resulting from the grant 

of -- the order granting additional time to prepare for 

the motion. And that, that is the related but different 

proceeding and a different kind of delay related to 

motions practice. So I would agree with Your Honor 

that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: The grant of the motion is 

the proceeding?

from that order and the order is ancillary to a listed 

proceeding, which is the pretrial motions because it 

facilitates that proceeding, because it provides for

statute; is that right?

 MR. ROBERTS: Well, I think (h)(1) says any 

period of delay resulting from other proceedings 

concerning the defendant. That could be a period, and 

it covers a whole range of proceedings that generate 

delay. And then --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I see.

 MR. ROBERTS: Then there is a list of 

examples. And the examples are intended only to be 

illustrative. And what's -- what's covered is in 

addition to those examples, other proceedings that are 

analogous or ancillary to them.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And you say the order is a 

proceeding for that purpose, the order granting the 

extension of time?

 MR. ROBERTS: That is the proceedings 

beforehand, Your Honor. Yes. But the -- that's not 

the -- you know, first of all, as I said, a proceeding 

is a -- is an act done by the court or under the court's 

authority, so in order to fit squarely within that.

delay following an order of removal or an order

 And, so, I think that there's indication in 

the examples themselves when orders are sometimes 

proceedings.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But just one quick 

question. It seems to me that everything described in 

(7)(A) would fit your description of proceedings.

 MR. ROBERTS: It -- there -- there would be 

an order, so there would be a proceeding. But it 

wouldn't be a proceeding that would be covered under 

(h)(1) because it -- to be covered it has to be a 

proceeding of the type that is listed here. It has to 

be analogous to these proceedings or ancillary to them, 

facilitating these proceedings in some way, Your Honor.

negative inference or limiting inference on the general 

standard of (h)(1).

 The fall on that is evident by looking at 

subparagraph (h), which automatically excludes up to 

30 days during which a matter is under advisement by the 

district court. If the government's reasoning is 

correct, subparagraph (h) just does not address or 

contains -- or suggests no negative inference on whether 

the 31st day of a matter being under advisement is 

automatically excludable under (h)(1). That's why there 

are settle -- in the statutory interpretation.

 We take the general standard, first of all, 

is it a proceeding? There is no pretrial motion 

proceeding until the motion is filed.

 Second, if you think there is any 

uncertainty as to what a proceeding is, well, look at 

how the enumerated subparagraphs that follow, what do 

they describe. One specifically addresses pretrial 

motions. It has a starting point and it has an end 

point. That's the end of this case.

 But even if you think you want to look 

further. Well, is there any support in these enumerated 

subparagraphs for the government's rule that you would 

treat a defense request for additional time differently? 

No. None of the enumerated subparagraphs distinguishes

between defense requests and government requests. None 

distinguishes between routinely granted time or 

specifically alloted time.

 In fact, with respect to defense requests 

specifically, it was not lost on Congress how to -- how 

to treat government counsel and defense counsel 

differently. In (h)(7)(C), which is about the end of 

justice exclusion, it specifies that the government 

cannot get an end of justice exclusion based on its 

inability to exercise due diligence in obtaining a 

witness or preparing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand -- I 

don't understand the government to be argue -- to be 

arguing that they are treated differently.

 MR. STANCIL: Well, the government's rule I 

think is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They are saying whoever --

whoever asked for the extension of time in order to 

prepare the motion gets it. And -- and it's the time 

limit's suspended.

 MR. STANCIL: That's not their position in 

their brief, Your Honor. They say the defense requests 

for additional time --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well --

MR. STANCIL: They don't say anything about

government request.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- they made it very clear 

here that they think it applies to both the defendant 

and the government.

 MR. STANCIL: If that's their position, it's 

more unmoored from the text of subparagraph (D), because 

then both types of requests -- so subparagraph -- pardon 

me -- so (h)(1)'s general standard is expanded even 

farther --

JUSTICE BREYER: You are right, (D) has a 

special time limit built into it -- I mean, (h) or 

whatever the number is now. It says not to exclude 

30 days. Okay?

 MR. STANCIL: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: None of the others do. So 

I would say right there, Congress doesn't want the judge 

to have it for more than 30 days. Congress doesn't say 

a word in any of the others that says anything about 

preparation time.

 MR. STANCIL: Well, I disagree about 

subparagraph (D) Your Honor. (D) says from point B 

to --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, I know. But there is 

not an indication about preparation time. Their 

argument is a literal argument under the statute. Is it

from other proceedings? Yes, we know that because of 

(D), okay? Does it result from other proceedings? Yes, 

because, in fact, the preparation time is a direct 

result of the other proceedings as defined in (D). 

Therefore, it is an ancillary matter related to other 

proceedings that was caused by the other proceedings. 

QED, their argument is literal and there is no policy 

against it. That's what they said.

 Now, as soon as you get to the last (h), you 

would find a big policy against it. Called not 

exceeding 30 days. Now, I take it that's roughly their 

argument.

 MR. STANCIL: But there is no --

JUSTICE BREYER: At least my interpretation 

of it.

 MR. STANCIL: There is no difference, Your 

Honor, between not exceeding 30 days and from and to. 

And I think this is -- this case -- it comes to that and 

that alone, which is Congress specifically addressed 

pretrial motions, any delay resulting from a pretrial 

motion and it said from point A to point B. And even if 

you had to look behind that, you would look at the 

legislative history and the Senate Judiciary Committee 

was asked a specific question by the government no less, 

can we include preparation time, and they said no.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, is your 

friend correct that the issue of the proper calculation 

is not before us? So that the time I spent figuring 

that out should be excluded from something?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. STANCIL: As the question was presented, 

Your Honor, it was specific to preparation time and the 

period -- and the period from -- I don't want to get the 

dates wrong but, September 7th to October 4th. But I 

would add that the government didn't raise this argument 

below, either. Nor did the government suggest, as I 

understand it, that the delay that's at issue here 

results from the grant on September 7th of additional 

time. Rather their argument as I have understood it and 

understood it when reading their briefs is that the 

delay -- the ancillary delay stems from the pretrial 

motion, the time allotted for pretrial motions itself.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I would have thought 

that whether or not you think that type of delay is 

excludable depends on what that type of delay is, which 

requires some sense of how it's going to be calculated.

 MR. STANCIL: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Does six days make a 

difference to your case? If they lose six days, do you 

win?
