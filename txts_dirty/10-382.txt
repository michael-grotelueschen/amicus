3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

4 argument today in case 10-382, United States v. 

Jicarilla Apache Nation. 

6  Mr. Shah. 

7  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH 

8  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9  MR. SHAH: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11  Relying on common law trust principles 

12 applicable to private fiduciaries, the Federal Circuit 

13 imposed on the United States a duty to disclose 

14 attorney-client privileged communications to an Indian 

tribe. That abrogation of the privilege should be 

16 reversed for at least three reasons. 

17  First, reflecting the sovereign nature of 

18 the United States function, the Indian trust context 

19 lacks the factors essential to recognition of a private 

trust fiduciary exception. Unlike in a private trust, 

21 government attorneys and other Federal officials owe an 

22 exclusive duty of loyalty to the United States, not to 

23 the beneficiary. The government pays the cost of trust 

24 administration out of appropriated funds, not out of the 

trust corpus. The government, not the trust, owns the 

3

1 resulting record, and the release of such governmental 

2 record, including to a tribe or individual Indian, is 

3 governed by specific statutes and regulations as well as 

4 the Freedom of Information Act, not the common law.

 Second, the decision below conflicts with 

6 this Court's precedents that distinguish the United 

7 States from a private trustee and that reject 

8 enforcement of duties governing the administration of 

9 Indian property that are not set forth by specific 

statute or regulation. 

11  The fiduciary exception to the 

12 attorney-client privilege is premised on a private 

13 trustee's general common law duty to disclose trust 

14 information, but no statute or regulation imposes such a 

duty on the United States. 

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, all of the 

17 statutes relating to these funds use the word "trust." 

18 Not one statute defines trust and says in any way this 

19 is not a fiduciary relationship. To the contrary, in 

fact, most of the statutes require what would be 

21 consistent with fiduciary obligations, and at least one 

22 of them that you rely on says "but not limited to." 

23  So the issue before us doesn't involve a 

24 competing sovereign interest by the U.S. You've 

conceded that in your cert petition. The circuit below

1 said this is not a case where there is an independent 

2 sovereign issue governing the U.S. activities. Just 

3 explain to me what's the rationale that would permit a 

4 trustee of a trust fund to withhold from the beneficiary 

the kinds of documents that relate to the management of 

6 the fund? If the funds exist for the benefit of the 

7 Indian tribe, why aren't they entitled to management 

8 documents? 

9  MR. SHAH: Okay -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the part that 

11 doesn't make -- that you're not explaining. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah, you might want 

13 to make your third point. You said you had three points 

14 preliminarily, so why don't you make your third point 

and then respond to the question. 

16  MR. SHAH: Sure, Your Honor. The third 

17 point is that the Federal Circuit's decision poses 

18 serious practical problems for the government because 

19 the general common law duty to disclose which undergirds 

the fiduciary exception extends to all trust information 

21 without regard to the existence of litigation; excepting 

22 it implies a broad and burdensome disclosure obligation. 

23 For example, there are over 300,000 individual account 

24 holders, individual Indian account holders on top of the 

tribal, tribal account holders. If this Court were to 

5

1 accept the fiduciary exception and thereby ratify the 

2 underlying rationale, presumably then any one of those 

3 or all of those 300-plus thousand individual account 

4 holders could simply call up the Interior Department and 

request all related trust records outside of the 

6 existing statutory and regulatory regime. 

7  Now, Justice Sotomayor, let me turn back to 

8 your set of questions, and let me start with the first 

9 point that you made, which is the statutes here use the 

term trust; why doesn't that connote some sort of broad 

11 fiduciary relationship? This Court has made clear in 

12 its precedents, and it dates back to the Mitchell 1, the 

13 first decision in Mitchell case, where Congress's use of 

14 the term "trust," the Court said, does not imply the 

full gamut of common law fiduciary obligations. 

16  The dissent made precisely -- the dissent in 

17 Mitchell made precisely the argument that you're 

18 sketching out here, which is when Congress uses a term 

19 like trust, we would naturally assume that it implies 

fiduciary obligations. The majority in Mitchell 

21 rejected that notion, and in fact in Mitchell 2 in the 

22 Navajo Nation decisions, the Court has continued to 

23 reject that proposition. But more -- more than as a 

24 matter of precedent I think that makes -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But in both -- in all of 

6

1 those cases, counsel, it was a limitation related to 

2 competing interests, meaning it was recognizing that 

3 there are potentially moments in which an attorney is 

4 acting both in the interest of the government and in the 

interest of the tribe. 

6  MR. SHAH: Justice Sotomayor, with respect, 

7 there is no competing interest that I'm aware of that 

8 were mentioned in -- in the Mitchell decisions, Mitchell 

9 1, Mitchell 2, or even the Navajo Nation decision. 

Those were simply -- in Mitchell 1 it was the Indian 

11 General Allotment Act, which said that the United States 

12 "shall hold in trust" land for the benefit of the 

13 Indians. The argument made by the tribe in that case 

14 and by the dissenters in the Court was when the Court 

said you shall hold the land in trust, that implies 

16 certain management and other responsibilities for 

17 resources related to that land. This Court said no, 

18 when Congress uses the term "trust" in the Indian 

19 context, that there must be specific statutory 

regulatory duties that the Court sets out. Let me 

21 explain -­

22  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But that was a 

23 jurisdictional question, not a question with respect 

24 to -- to the -- to the obligation. You're not seriously 

suggesting that if you're a trustee of an Indian fund 

7

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 that you can breach your fiduciary duty by simply not 

2 exercising care in your investment strategies. So some 

3 form of -- of duty exists. 

4  MR. SHAH: Sure, and let me -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- from the common law, 

6 and the common law has to define that. 

7  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I agree 

8 everything up to the point when you said we go to the 

9 common law. Of course there would be in this context 

some enforceable duties with respect to investment of 

11 the funds held in trust, and that's because the relevant 

12 statutes, section 161a and 162a, set forth specific 

13 investment duties that the government must comply with. 

14 Now, as to your other point, that Mitchell 1 and the 

Navajo Nation -­

16  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And so why would, if it 

17 imposes those duties, protect you from disclosing items 

18 that might -- attorney confidences that go to that very 

19 act, the very act of investing in the way, even under 

your definition, that the trust requires you to? 

21  MR. SHAH: A couple responses, Your Honor. 

22 The -- the two statutes that you're talking about, 161a 

23 and 162a, set forth specific investment duties. They 

24 don't say anything about disclosure. The 1994 Act does 

set forth some disclosure obligations, but they are 

8

5
10

15

20

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 extremely discrete. There are essentially two 

2 disclosure obligations that all of these statutes 

3 together impose. The -- the United States must provide 

4 an account statement, a quarterly account statement; and 

the United States must provide the -- the Indian tribes 

6 and individual Indians an annual audit. That is the 

7 extent of disclosure obligations that Congress has set 

8 forth and that the Interior Department by regulation has 

9 implemented.

 Now, to the -- to the extent that your 

11 question suggests that the tribes may need more in order 

12 to enforce those enforcement duties, I think the -- the 

13 account statements and the annual audit goes a long way 

14 towards suggesting that if there is a problem, then the 

tribe may want to try to enforce those duties. 

16  The other point I would make is, although 

17 the legally enforceable duties under this Court's 

18 decisions in Mitchell and Navajo Nation are those set 

19 forth by statute and regulation, that doesn't mean the 

Interior Department doesn't have discretion to provide 

21 more information. And in fact, in practice, the 

22 Interior Department does provide a much broader swath of 

23 information to the Indian tribes regarding these 

24 accounts than the two discrete pieces of information 

that the statutes set forth.

1  JUSTICE ALITO: Do you agree that the -- do 

2 you agree that the fiduciary exception is well 

3 established as a general matter? 

4  MR. SHAH: Your Honor, the United States 

does not contest the existence of a fiduciary exception 

6 in certain private trust contexts where the criteria for 

7 that exception are satisfied. So the answer is no, we 

8 don't, we don't dispute the existence in certain 

9 contexts under certain circumstances of a fiduciary 

exception. 

11  JUSTICE ALITO: So if this cause arose in a 

12 different context with a different trustee, the position 

13 of the United States would be that under Rule 501 of the 

14 Federal Rules of Evidence there is a fiduciary exception 

to the attorney-client privilege? 

16  MR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor. It would depend 

17 on the circumstances. For example, if it were a private 

18 trust and the factors that -- in which the courts, the 

19 old English cases, for example, have recognized where 

the fiduciary exception applies, that is the information 

21 is sought solely for the benefit of the beneficiary, the 

22 expenses for that legal advice are paid out of the trust 

23 corpus, and as a result of that, the resulting legal 

24 advice and the resulting records belong to the trust 

corpus. All of those things give right, as the old

1 English cases say, give right to a common law right of 

2 access for the beneficiary to access those. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah, you don't have 

4 to take a position on that, because you don't represent 

a private trustee. And the government can accept 

6 arguendo that there would be such a relationship, but I 

7 don't think you have to defend it. 

8  MR. SHAH: Absolutely, the Court need not 

9 decide that question in order to reach the question. 

The Court can assume it arguendo and then go forward. I 

11 think the critical point here is, though, that all of 

12 the factors that underlie that -- that exception in the 

13 private trustee concept are absent here. Here the 

14 government is acting out of its own interest. It is 

paying for the legal advice out of congressional 

16 appropriations. The government owns the records at 

17 issue by virtue of the Federal Records Act, by virtue of 

18 Interior Department regulations, which are cited in the 

19 back of our brief make very clear that the government 

owns these records, and because they are governmental 

21 records their disclosure is not governed by the common 

22 law. There is a highly -­

23  JUSTICE ALITO: The thrust of what -- my 

24 understanding of the thrust of what Justice Sotomayor 

was asking is something like the following: It's easy 

11
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 to understand how there can be competing government 

2 interests when you're talking about some, the management 

3 of lands, things of that nature. But when you're just 

4 talking about managing funds, what competing interests 

can there be in practical terms? If you assume arguendo 

6 that this exception applies to a private trustee, why 

7 should it not apply to the government in practical 

8 terms? 

9  MR. SHAH: Sure. Let me provide two 

responses, Justice Alito. First, I think as a formal 

11 position I don't think our position turns, as a formal 

12 matter, on the existence of a specific competing duty. 

13 I think such a rule would overlook the ways in which the 

14 U.S. inherently, United States inherently differs from a 

private trustee. And I think that's especially true in 

16 the light of the complex multifaceted ways in which the 

17 government interacts with Indians and Indian tribes. 

18 Those sovereign obligations extend to law -- providing 

19 law enforcement, educational duties, health services. 

One subset of those duties are the type of trust 

21 responsibilities at issue in this case. 

22  Now, to be more concrete, I think, even 

23 putting aside that larger framework which may create 

24 tensions between the United States and with -- and the 

Indian tribes in certain circumstances, I think even in 

12

1 the trust fund, purely in the trust fund context that 

2 we're talking about, there could be at least tensions 

3 that arise. 

4  For example, the D.C. Circuit in the Cobell 

case when it talked about the accounting obligation that 

6 it imposed on the government, it made clear that it's 

7 not the same accounting obligation that would apply at 

8 common law. And the reason the D.C. Circuit gave was 

9 because the United States would be taking that -­

performing that obligation at the expense of taxpayers. 

11 There are budgetary constraints that the United States 

12 must take into consideration as a sovereign. Maybe 

13 that's not a specific competing obligation in the formal 

14 sense, but I think it's -- it's a factor that 

distinguishes the United States from a private 

16 fiduciary. 

17  Also, there are -- for example in our brief 

18 we discuss one of, just as an example, one of the 

19 documents at issue in this case, which involves a 

judgment by a tribal court seeking to attach funds from 

21 an individual Indian money account. The United States 

22 acts as a trustee with respect to that individual -­

23 Indian account. It may be the case that the United 

24 States consistent with its fiduciary obligations in that 

sense could simply pay out the judgment, but I think

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose we have the Union 

6 Trust Company, a private company that has 5,000 trust 

7 accounts. One day the president of the company says to 

8 the lawyer: Mr. Smith's account is in a special 

9 situation. Will you please look into what we should do 

for him as trustee? There's no implication for any 

11 other account. There's no threat of litigation. I just 

12 want to know what we're supposed to do. Now, I take it 

13 the document that is subsequently written would be open 

14 for Mr. Smith to get; is that right?

 MR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor. We do not -­

16  JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, okay. Now, why should 

17 the government be treated differently were the situation 

18 identical to what I just proposed? 

19  MR. SHAH: I think the response is, Your 

Honor, is that the situation will never be identical to 

21 the hypothetical you posed because the government 

22 inherently differs, and let me set out -­

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But this argument, 

24 frankly, would be -- we wouldn't have any need for 501, 

because if as an evidentiary rule the government is 

14
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

15

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 always different, then there is no situation in which 

2 fiduciary duties in common law would ever exist. 

3  MR. SHAH: To be clear, Justice Sotomayor, 

4 the government is not arguing that no common law 

exception to the attorney-client privilege can apply to 

6 the government or that Federal Rule 501, Federal Rule of 

7 Evidence 501 is otherwise inapplicable. We're making a 

8 much more limited argument that this particular common 

9 law fiduciary exception is not applicable to the 

government, and that is because the premise of that 

11 fiduciary exception does not apply. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is there -- is there any 

13 greater value to a fiduciary duty than to manage the 

14 account for the benefit of the beneficiary? That's the 

very essence of what a trust means, and so I'm having a 

16 hard time understanding not a competing interest 

17 situation where you're addressing a different statutory 

18 requirement, but merely -- and that's what this case was 

19 presented as, merely the management of the trust. So 

what you're, it seems to me, you're arguing is there is 

21 no duty. You're saying it's all defined by statute 

22 only, but you're rendering -- there's no need to use the 

23 word "trust" because it wouldn't be a trust. 

24  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I don't think 

that those two things are inconsistent. The fact that

25

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1 we don't look to the common law to fill in all of the 

2 duties doesn't mean that the government doesn't have 

3 duties in this context. It has very specific duties, to 

4 invest the funds properly, to invest the funds as set 

forth in the statutes. What this Court has said could 

6 not be done is to look at the general common law to 

7 create obligations on the government. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: I would like to get an 

9 answer to my question.

 MR. SHAH: Sure. 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: My question, to go back to 

12 it, was imagine that the government has a thousand trust 

13 accounts for a thousand tribes. 

14  MR. SHAH: Okay.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And imagine that several of 

16 them consist of nothing more than $500,000 in cash. 

17  MR. SHAH: Okay. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: And one day the Secretary 

19 of the Interior says to a lawyer: I fear there is kind 

of a difficult fiduciary problem arising into account 

21 number 302, which is owned by such and such tribe. 

22 There is no threat of litigation. As far as I can tell, 

23 the answer to this will have no implication for anything 

24 else in the government. Will you please look at it and 

give me a memo what to do? 

16

Official - Subject to Final Review 

1  Now, why should that memo not be given to 

2 the lawyer for the tribe if in the identical case of the 

3 Union Trust Company you would give the lawyer -- the 

4 memo to the beneficiary?

 MR. SHAH: A couple of reasons, Your Honor. 

6 First, as this Court recognized, starting back in 1912 

7 in the Heckman case, and reiterated in the Candelaria 

8 and Minnesota cases after that, is that the United 

9 States is not acting simply out of the beneficiary's 

interests. 

11  So in the hypothetical, the original 

12 hypothetical that you posed in the corporation or the 

13 bank that was acting as a trustee, there the trustee is 

14 simply acting out of its fiduciary obligation solely to 

benefit the beneficiary. That is not how the 

16 governments work. As this Court made clear, the 

17 government is acting not out of the beneficiary's 

18 interests, it is acting out of its own sovereign 

19 interest in managing the statutes and regulations that 

govern the administration of Indian property. That's a 

21 fundamental difference. 

22  JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying, one, we're 

23 not really a trustee totally? 

24  MR. SHAH: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay. Now, if we 

17

1 treated -- the courts treated you as a trustee really 

2 and totally -­

3  MR. SHAH: Sure. 

4  JUSTICE BREYER: -- in this very limited 

situation I described, what harm would befall the 

6 government? 

7  MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, we would still 

8 win, and here's why. The factors that -- even assuming 

9 a common law trustee, the fiduciary exception doesn't 

apply automatically at all common law trustees. There's 

11 several things that underlie that fiduciary exception. 

12  One, the -- the -- the advice sought is 

13 typically paid for out of the trust corpus, and as a 

14 result of that fact, the trust itself owns the records. 

Those are the principal two factors that the cases 

16 recognizing a fiduciary exception rely upon to create a 

17 common law right of access of the beneficiary to such 

18 records. 

19  None of those factors are present here. The 

government pays for these -- for -- for the cost of 

21 administration, including legal advice, out of 

22 congressionally appropriated funds. The records 

23 resulting from that advice belonged to the government. 

24 The government owns those records, both as a matter of 

statute and regulation. And the disclosure of those 

18

1 records is subject to a highly reticulated regime. 

2 There are statutes, there is regulations, there is the 

3 Freedom of Information Act. All of that would be 

4 bypassed if this Court were to accept the fiduciary 

exception in this context. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shah -­

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Other than the time and 

8 expense of going through voluminous records, which is 

9 obvious, is there any other harm to the government in 

being required to show that there's a competing interest 

11 that makes disclosure unnecessary or improper? 

12  MR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor. As I said to 

13 Justice Alito, it may not always be that the government 

14 can point to a specific competing interest in the sense 

that Justice Sotomayor is talking about, a competing 

16 statutory interest. But there are inherently these 

17 tensions, budgetary concerns, other ways in which the 

18 United States interacts with Indian affairs. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is one -- is one of them 

shielding government actors? I mean, from what you said 

21 so far, on the one hand you recognize that it is what we 

22 call a guardian, the guardian-ward relationship between 

23 the United States and the tribe. But what you seem to 

24 be suggesting is that the government has a dual focus, 

and one is its guardianship relation to the tribe, but

1 the other is these are government actors and the 

2 government is also interested in shielding its actors. 

3  Is that -- is that it or is it a more 

4 nebulous interest?

 MR. SHAH: Well, Your Honor, I think it 

6 could be more nebulous -- but -- but there -- I think 

7 there is a real chilling concern. And I think this

9 Interior Department, in order to properly administer, to 

carry out the statutory and regulatory duties, it often

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, this is just the

17 the -- the exception for providing attorney's advice. 

18 The ordinary private litigant doesn't have to show, when 

19 he refuses to turn over attorney advice, that there's 

some conflict which would make it harmful for him to 

21 turn that over, does he?

obligation to -­

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: And -- and so, once you 

7 establish that this isn't the normal trust complex, we 

8 apply the normal Rule 301 law, and -- and that does not 

9 require the person who declines to turn over the 

information to show why it would really hurt him to turn 

11 it over, right? 

12  MR. SHAH: I think that's exactly correct, 

13 Justice Scalia. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: How many -- how many of 

these mismanagement suits are there? Do you have any 

16 estimate? 

17  MR. SHAH: Yes. Currently there are about 

18 90 such pending suits, counting all of the district 

19 courts as well as the Court of Federal Claims. And -­

and -- and of course, this issue could arise in any of 

21 those cases. 

22  Let me get back to one of Justice 

23 Sotomayor's questions, the -- the initial question about 

24 the fact that the Congress has used the term "trust." I 

think as a matter of precedent, both the Mitchell 

21

1 decisions and the Navajo Nation decisions, I think those 

2 are binding, controlling precedent, and the Court should 

3 not deviate from those precedents that say a statute or 

4 regulation must define the duty. But beyond the binding 

nature of those precedents, I think they make sense from 

6 first principles as well, and let me try to explain why. 

7  The -- the -- the term "trust" has been used 

8 by both Congress and the courts in a variety of ways, 

9 often in a variety of imprecise ways, when it comes to 

the relationship between the United States and Indians 

11 and Indian tribes. Courts and Congress have used the 

12 term when it comes to providing law enforcement, when it 

13 comes to providing educational services, health 

14 services, none of which are really the type of private 

common law trust that we know. 

16  And even in scenarios where there is a 

17 discrete property interest that might bring us closer to 

18 the common law context, this Court has used -- this 

19 Court and Congress has recognized that "trust" can mean 

a lot of different things. It can mean the type of bare 

21 trust that was at issue in Mitchell 1, the Indian 

22 General Allotment Act, when the trust was really simply 

23 to avoid alienation of the land. It may mean specific 

24 investment duties, as we have here.

 But the point is that there is no "one size

1 fits all" trust terminology, and so that's why it makes 

2 sense for this Court to require Congress to set forth 

3 the specific duties and statutes, and the Interior 

4 Department to set forth specific duties and regulations 

before it implies such a sweeping obligation on the 

6 United States. 

7  I think it also flows from a more general 

8 principle of a reluctance to hold the United States to 

9 common law duties when there's an existing statutory and 

regulatory regime. I think for all of those reasons, 

11 not only as a matter of precedent, but as -- as a matter 

12 of principle, I think the -- the -- the fiduciary 

13 exception would -- would not apply here. 

14  JUSTICE KENNEDY: I hadn't thought about 

your argument until this -- until you made it this 

16 morning, that if there -- if -- if the tribe is correct 

17 that it owns these documents and gets -- can get them 

18 anytime, but the -- the -- the trial court here divided 

19 the documents into five categories.

 MR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor. 

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: As to some of those 

22 categories it -- it denied -- it denied production. 

23  MR. SHAH: Yes, Your Honor, but those -­

24  JUSTICE KENNEDY: And I take it did that in

1 privilege, including work product, which were the

3  MR. SHAH: Right. As I understand it, 

4 you're right, Justice Kennedy, that most of the 

documents that the -- the trial court said the 

6 government didn't have to produce were, as you stated, 

7 attorney work product privileges -- privileged 

8 documents, and those the trial -- the trial court said 

9 that no fiduciary exception would apply to the attorney 

work product privilege. And it was on that basis that 

11 it allowed the government to withhold the documents. 

12  If there are no further questions, I would 

13 like to reserve the remainder of my time.

17  ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN D. GORDON 

18  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

19  MR. GORDON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

21  The Jicarilla Apache Nation has sued the 

22 government for mismanaging millions of dollars of its 

23 trust monies. No trustee in this situation, including 

24 the government, is entitled to withhold the legal advice 

that it has received about managing the beneficiary's

1 money. The beneficiary is entitled to see that legal 

2 advice, so that it can determine whether the trustee 

3 followed the advice. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It's -- you don't 

doubt that in this context sovereign commands would 

6 trump trustee obligations, do you? In other words, if 

7 Congress -­

8  MR. GORDON: I -- I -- I do not -- I do not, 

9 Mr. Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. 

11  MR. GORDON: The -- the notion of -- the 

12 issue here is an issue of evidence, and it is controlled 

13 by Federal Rule 501, which specifies that Federal courts 

14 that resolve claims of privilege based on common law 

principles. Under the common law, a trustee cannot 

16 assert the attorney-client privilege to withhold from a 

17 fiduciary legal advice about management of the trust. 

18  That, I submit, is the end of the analysis. 

19  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what do you make of 

the fact that the Uniform Trust Code reserves decision 

21 on the question whether there is a fiduciary exception 

22 to the attorney-client privilege? That seems to suggest 

23 that as a general matter, this is not as 

24 well-established as you seem to argue.

1 there are a handful of States that have not recognized 

2 the fiduciary exception, but there is no Federal circuit 

3 that has refused to recognize it. Indeed, all of the 

4 Federal circuits that have considered it have adopted 

it, and it is recognized in both, as we stated in our 

6 brief, the Restatement of Trusts and the Restatement of 

7 the law Governing Lawyers. 

8  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Gordon -­

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Has it ever been applied, 

to your knowledge, where -- where it was not the case 

11 that the trust paid for the attorney's advice out of the 

12 trust funds and where the trust did -- where -- where 

13 the trust owned the papers that consisted of the 

14 attorney's advice? Is there any case where those two 

conditions or either one of them did not exist where 

16 the -- the trust was required to turn over the 

17 attorney's advice? 

18  MR. GORDON: Justice Scalia, I -- I cannot 

19 cite a specific case -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but, see, that's the 

21 argument of the government, that the exception, the 

22 trust exception to the extent that it exists, was based 

23 principally upon the fact that these papers belonged to 

24 the trust and that the attorney's advice had been paid 

for by the trust, so of course the trustee is entitled

1 to get it. 

2  MR. GORDON: But that's not correct, if -­

3 if I may, Mr. Justice. If you look at the seminal 

4 American decision, the Riggs Bank decision that's cited 

in both briefs, they talk about the rationales and they 

6 said that the first rationale is that the trustee acts 

7 as a proxy for the beneficiary in obtaining the advice. 

8  The second rationale is that the trustee has 

9 a general duty to disclose relevant information to the 

beneficiary. The Court mentioned that one factor that 

11 it would look at was who had paid for the legal advice, 

12 but it did not suggest that that was determinative, and 

13 indeed subsequent case law has made clear that it is 

14 not, and the Restatement says explicitly that who paid 

is not the controlling factor. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: But you don't have a single 

17 case? 

18  MR. GORDON: Not that I can cite right now. 

19 But it would be -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought Riggs -- you 

21 said Riggs was a case where the trust fund paid the 

22 lawyer, and the Court distinguished cases where that 

23 wasn't so, where the trustee was paying the lawyer for 

24 the trustee's own protection, and the Court went out of 

its way to say we are dealing with a case where the

1 lawyer is paid out of trust funds. In Riggs, the -­

2 case, right? 

3  MR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor. But the issue 

4 -- this is, I submit, letting the tail wag the dog. 

What we are talking about is money that belongs to the 

6 beneficiary. We're talking about money. We're not 

7 talking about a bare trust. We're talking about a 

8 full-fledged trust under Mitchell 2. Indeed, this Court 

9 in Mitchell 2 said that trusts involving the management 

of Indian money were full-fledged trusts. And in that 

11 situation for the government to say that, while any 

12 private fiduciary would be obliged to show to the 

13 beneficiary the legal advice it's received when there's 

14 an issue about whether it's fulfilled its fiduciary 

duties, it's different because we've spent our 

16 hard-earned money on these lawyers and we own the 

17 records in issue. I mean, that doesn't make sense. 

18  And basically as a matter of discovery, 

19 which is where we are right now, the posture of the 

case, whenever you seek discovery, in virtually all of 

21 those circumstances the documents in issue are going to 

22 belong to the opposing party. 

23  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, the 

24 attorney-client privilege is policy-based and I'm 

concerned about the policy implications of your

1 position. Our system has concluded that it works best 

2 if people have candid advice from their lawyers, and my 

3 concern here is if you're a lawyer -- you are a lawyer 

4 -- and -- and you're asked for your advice by a 

trustee -­

6  MR. GORDON: Right. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and if you know 

8 that that is going to be shared with the beneficiary, 

9 you're going to give bland, mushy, hedging advice rather 

than direct and candid advice to the trustee, because 

11 it's going to be shared more widely beyond the trustee. 

12 And that's -- that hurts not only the trustee, but also 

13 the beneficiaries, whose trustee does not have candid 

14 legal advice.

 MR. GORDON: My response to that would be 

16 twofold, Your Honor. The first is that that same 

17 argument can be made for any private fiduciary, yet the 

18 courts have felt that the more important relationship is 

19 the relationship between the trustee and the 

beneficiary, that that trumps the need for or the 

21 desirability for private discussions between the -­

1 trust: I don't know if I have to do this or I have to 

2 do this. 

3  MR. GORDON: Right. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it seems to me 

if the -- if the information is always going to be 

6 shared with the beneficiary, the trustee is always going 

7 to get hedged advice. 

8  MR. GORDON: Well, if it's never shared, 

9 Your Honor, then it leaves it at the option of the 

trustee to selectively waive the privilege when it's to 

11 its advantage in a breach of trust suit. 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: No. Why can't the trustee 

13 say: I'm going to hire my own lawyer? I'm not going to 

14 pay this lawyer out of trust funds, so it will be my 

lawyer, and his advice is only to me and serving my 

16 interests? Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't that suffice? 

17  MR. GORDON: I think the issue, Your Honor, 

18 is whether that, in fact, is what the trustee is 

19 seeking. If the trustee is seeking advice about 

personal liability, then I certainly agree that the 

21 trustee could do that. If the trustee instead is 

22 seeking advice, regardless of who pays for it, but is 

23 seeking legal advice about how the trustee should manage 

24 money belonging to the beneficiary -­

1 a question of liability. If he messes up and doesn't 

2 manage it the way he's supposed to, he will be liable. 

3 So the distinction you draw doesn't seem to me to be a 

4 workable one.

 MR. GORDON: Well, Your Honor, I -- I submit 

6 that the whole issue is if there is a suit for breach of 

7 trust, which is the precondition for all of this, 

8 whether in that circumstance the trustee is obliged to 

9 produce the legal advice that it has received so the 

beneficiary can be -­

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: The trustee cannot hire his 

12 own lawyer, you're saying. So long as he's a trustee, 

13 he cannot hire his own lawyer to get advice on how to 

14 manage the trust in a way that will avoid his liability. 

He just can't do it, right? Trustees can't -­

16  MR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor, that's the 

17 position. And that puts the government in no different 

18 position than private beneficiaries or ERISA 

19 beneficiaries or any other sorts of beneficiaries.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What's your best case that 

21 you have on that in the private trustee context? I had 

22 thought your answer was going to be that in that case, 

23 the fact that the payment is made by the trustee out of 

24 the trustee's own funds and not out of the trust funds 

might be dispositive and might give him the privilege.

1 But you -- you seem to say, in answer to the questions 

2 from the Court, that, other than this distinction you 

3 make between what the personal liability is and how he 

4 ought to manage the trust, which I think is a murky 

distinction, that the documents have to be disclosed. 

6 What's your best case for that? 

7  MR. GORDON: Justice Kennedy, let me respond 

8 to that. And I agree that who is paying for it -- if 

9 the trustee is paying for it out of his own or her own 

pocket, that is a factor that certainly should be looked 

11 at and would be entitled to -- to some weight in terms 

12 of what the purpose of the advice was for; but 

13 ultimately the issue is whether the trustee is seeking 

14 to protect personal interests, protect against a claim 

of liability, for example, or whether is -- the trustee 

16 is looking for advice about how to manage the 

17 beneficiary's money. 

18  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I'm the trustee, 

19 and I say I would like legal advice as to whether I 

should renegotiate this lease with the government. 

21  MR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, I want that 

23 advice so I manage the trust correctly, and I'm 

24 concerned if I don't manage the trust correctly I'm 

going to be sued. Now is the document from the lawyer

2  MR. GORDON: I think, Your Honor, that if it 

3 focuses on how to manage it properly, then -- and it's 

4 prospective, then I think that the -- it -- it is not 

privileged. If, instead, you posit, you know, this is 

6 what I did and I'm concerned I may have screwed up, do 

7 you think I'm liable, then I think a different answer 

8 may obtain. 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if he says this 

is what I did and I might be liable, it's privileged. 

11 If he says this is what I'm going to do -­

12  MR. GORDON: Please tell me what to do, yes. 

13  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Which means you can't get 

14 preventative advice, which is one of the most important 

kinds of advice an attorney can give. 

16  MR. GORDON: Well, Your Honor, I agree 

17 preventative advice is the most -- is among the most 

18 important one can give. But why should the government 

19 be in a different position with regard to this than the 

private beneficiary? 

21  JUSTICE BREYER: I have a question on that 

22 particular point, and there may be an obvious answer to 

23 this which I just couldn't find. But if the lawyer is 

24 in the government and he writes a memo, then -- and if 

it's available to a litigant who litigates against the

2 available to the entire world via the Freedom of 

3 Information Act? 

4  MR. GORDON: Your Honor, the Court said in 

the Sears decision, which is the cited in our brief -- I 

6 believe it's in footnote 16 -- that citizens' access 

7 rights under FOIA are not necessarily coextensive 

8 with -­

9  JUSTICE BREYER: That's certainly true, 

they're not. But I just wonder, what is it in FOIA that 

11 would make this not available to the world? 

12  MR. GORDON: That, Your Honor, and also the 

13 fundamental -­

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that just -- that 

just says it may or may not be coextensive. Reading the 

16 statute, it says you have to make all inter- agency or 

17 all memos available of a certain type, which I think 

18 this would fall into. Then exception 5 protects, among 

19 other things, attorney-client memos that are privileged 

because they're inter-agency or intra-agency memos that 

21 would not be available by law to a party other than an 

22 agency in litigation.

8  JUSTICE BREYER: If there isn't an obvious

11 this Court's decision in Julian, where it said that 

12 different classes of persons may have different rights 

13 under FOIA -- the right we are talking about here is the 

14 right of the beneficiaries. We're not talking about the 

citizen's right to see how Indian trust monies have been 

16 managed.

1 prospective advice about liability, does that doom your 

2 argument here for the reason that the government claims 

3 it has no ability to set up a system like this, to have 

4 some attorneys in the solicitor's office provide advice 

regarding the management of the funds and other 

6 attorneys in the solicitor's office provide advice 

7 regarding -- regarding the possibility of prospective 

8 liability in light of all of these suits that you 

9 mentioned?

 MR. GORDON: Well, Your Honor, again I come 

11 back that the trustee is entitled where the issue is 

12 liability, rather than how to manage the money. The -­

13 that gets into an area that would not be subject to the 

14 fiduciary exceptions. So if that is the focus of the 

advice, a private beneficiary wouldn't have to give up 

16 that advice and we don't contend that the government 

17 should, either. But where, as here, all of the 

18 documents are general documents that deal generally with 

19 how to manage Indian trust funds -­

JUSTICE SCALIA: Again, as the Chief Justice 

21 pointed out, that seems to me an artificial distinction. 

22 What I ask from -- for from the attorney is advice as to 

23 how I can manage the trust so as to avoid liability. I 

24 mean, the -- the two are connected. You can't separate 

out advice as to how to manage, how to manage the trust

1 from advice as to how to avoid liability. In the -- in 

2 the context of asking, of a trustee's asking advice, the 

3 two are the same. 

4  MR. GORDON: Well, Your Honor, at -- at some 

logical level there is a link there that can never be 

6 severed, but I submit, respectfully, that the 

7 government, when it's getting advice about managing 

8 trust funds, is not really focused on its liability. 

9 The government's liability, after all, is much more 

circumscribed than private fiduciaries, in any number of 

11 ways. 

12  It is seeking legal advice about what is the 

13 proper way to invest, can we do this, can we pool funds, 

14 can we do -- you know, can we make a certain type of 

investment or is it prohibited to us. And advice of 

16 that nature is advice to which the beneficiary is 

17 entitled. 

18  A private beneficiary -- the beneficiaries 

19 of private trusts are entitled, and Indians, whose money 

is being managed because the government has taken on 

21 itself by statute and said, we are going to take control 

22 of your monies and we're going to manage them, have no 

23 lesser right to get access to this highly relevant 

24 information when they litigate for breach of trust.

1 I -- I take it, between attorney-client privilege and 

2 work product. Initially, you were seeking both on the 

3 theory that the tribe is in fact the client, but 

4 apparently you are not pressing that point any more 

about work product? 

6  MR. GORDON: In fact, Your Honor, there is 

7 some case law that says the fiduciary exception can be 

8 applied to -- to work product. We did not press that 

9 point in the Court of Federal Claims. We -- focused our 

request for documents on attorney-client, not on work 

11 product. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So under your theory 

13 if there's a claim of privilege on -- on -- on the 

14 government's behalf, presumably the district court would 

conduct an in-camera review to determine whether it was 

16 retrospective for liability or prospective for 

17 responsibility? 

18  MR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor, which is 

19 exactly what happened here. The Court of Federal Claims 

reviewed all of the documents in camera and made a 

21 document-by-document determination, which is, of course, 

22 the standard approach when you're talking about 

23 attorney-client privilege. It's done on a document by

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they -- they 

9 could be retrospective, too, right? The government 

exposes itself to liability, obviously, in these areas 

11 as well. That's the basis for your suit, right? 

12  MR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor. 

13  The -- I want to pick up, I believe it was 

14 on a comment that you made, Justice Sotomayor, when you 

said that under the government's theory there would be 

16 no need for Rule 501. And indeed, they say that it's 

17 not enough. 501 on its face says apply common law 

18 principles. And the government's argument is that's not 

19 enough unless there's some other statute that requires 

common law principles to be applied to. 

21  Now, this is a neat trick. You just read 

22 501 out of the Rules of Evidence when it comes to the 

23 government, notwithstanding that 501 itself says it's to 

24 be used to determine privilege claims by the government, 

and that's reinforced in Federal Rule of Evidence 1101,

2 to apply in the Court of Federal Claims. 

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose the 

4 government as a whole has an obligation to act in the 

best interests of the citizenry, right? Why doesn't the 

6 same theory apply to any citizen? 

7  Look, government, you're supposed to -­

8 you're acting in a fiduciary statute -- status with 

9 respect to me. You're supposed to be acting in my best 

interests. If you're getting advice from the, you know, 

11 Department of Justice about what to do, I'm entitled to 

12 get that. 

13  MR. GORDON: Your Honor, it -- I think that 

14 that could pick up on the same distinction that the 

Court has already drawn in Mitchell 1 and Mitchell 2, 

16 between bare trust and a full-fledged trust. The 

17 government may have a general duty to act in the 

18 interests of all citizens. Indeed, I think we would all 

19 agree with that. But that does not mean that the 

government is engaging in the conduct of a full-fledged 

21 trust with respect to citizens. It's not. 

22  Its relationship to citizens day in and day 

23 out is akin to, in fact maybe even a level below, the 

24 bare trust relationship that was at issue in Mitchell 1.

 So, we're not proposing a -- a sweeping new

1 rule here. It's the government that's proposing to 

2 transform this Court's jurisprudence about Indians, 

3 because the notion that the only enforceable obligations 

4 it has are those set forth in statute or regulation, 

were the Court to adopt that, it would be overruling its 

6 decision in White Mountain Apache. 

7  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Are there any 

8 other -- are there any other areas in which the 

9 government's relationship to particular groups of 

citizens is that of fiduciary to beneficiary? 

11  MR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor. 

12  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What are some of 

13 those? 

14  MR. GORDON: Well, the -- the principal one 

we could find, which is cited in our brief, is with 

16 respect to government retirees who make voluntary 

17 contributions to their fund, and the government's 

18 argument here could be applied to them. 

19  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And your argument 

could be applied to them? 

21  MR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor, and I'm happy 

22 for it to be. I believe it should be.

I couldn't get how you spell it. 

11  MR. GORDON: I will -- it -- 486 U.S. 1, 

12 1988, Your Honor. 

13  The -- there is another inconsistency in the 

14 government's position here that I would like to 

highlight for the Court, if I may. That is this: The 

16 government relies on the common law in the first place 

17 to say it has a privilege. There's no statute that 

18 gives the government attorney-client privilege. So it 

19 relies on common law saying: We have an attorney-client 

privilege. 

21  Now, that's fine under Federal Rule 501. 

22 But the government says, while it can rely on common 

23 law, Jicarilla cannot rely on that same common law to 

24 establish the limits on the privilege it's claiming. 

This Court described that sort of argument as "heads I

2 And I submit that it can't be right here. The -­

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The government is 

4 maintaining throughout that it wears two hats. On the 

one hand it is a guardian or a trustee, and on the other 

6 hand it is the sovereign. So it's the latter, the 

7 government's claim that it is the sovereign, that makes 

8 the difference, it's not the -­

9  MR. GORDON: I agree, Your Honor, that 

that's their claim. But the government hasn't shown how 

11 the fact that it is the sovereign, which we certainly 

12 concede, makes any meaningful difference for purposes of 

13 the issue presented here. The cases it cites establish 

14 that the government, because it is sovereign, in some 

instances has broader authority than a private trustee 

16 would to help out the beneficiary. And I believe that 

17 that is -­

18  JUSTICE KENNEDY: But it also has broader 

19 authority, and that's just their point, I take it, for 

many other areas. The sovereign can't easily divest 

21 itself of its responsibilities. A trustee can so 

22 conform and shape its business that it doesn't have 

23 conflicts. A government just can't do that. 

24  MR. GORDON: Well, Your Honor, I agree, but 

the issue of conflicting, competing interests, first of

1 all it arises in the private trust context and it arises 

2 frequently. Anytime you've got a life beneficiary and a 

3 remainderman, you've got a potential conflict between 

4 the beneficiaries; and this issue of conflict has led to 

the development of the duty of impartiality for private 

6 trustees; and it's discussed at length in section 79 of 

7 the Restatement. 

8  So the notion of competing interests is not 

9 unique to the government. The government may have some 

different competing interests than a private trustee 

11 might have. That's certainly conceivable. And if it 

12 does, the existence of a specific competing interest may 

13 affect whether the action that the government takes is 

14 or is not a breach of trust.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We're not talking here 

16 about competing interests. I mean, the example you give 

17 of -- of the life beneficiary and the remainderman, 

18 those are interests of the beneficiaries that conflict. 

19  MR. GORDON: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We're talking here about an 

21 interest of the trustee that conflicts with what he is 

22 supposed to do, with respect to the person who is the 

23 beneficiary of the trust. That -- that's a totally 

24 different situation.

 MR. GORDON: Well, Your Honor, I submit that

1 it's not totally -­

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: And ordinarily if there is 

3 that kind of a conflict where the trustee has a personal 

4 conflict, he has to step down as trustee. You can't 

continue to be trustee when you -- your own financial 

6 interests, for example, are against the financial 

7 interests of the beneficiary; right? 

8  MR. GORDON: Well, Your Honor, you're 

9 positing that the trustee has a personal interest that's 

adverse to the beneficiary. 

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: That's what the government 

12 asserts: I have other duties as government besides my 

13 duties to the -- to these Indians. 

14  MR. GORDON: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And sometimes those duties 

16 conflict with my duties to the Indians. 

17  MR. GORDON: Those are competing 

18 responsibilities. I agree that the government may have 

19 that, and that may affect whether the decision that they 

ultimately make is or is not an appropriate decision. 

21 But it does not affect their duty to disclose as a 

22 matter of evidence the legal advice that they use to 

23 make that judgment. The beneficiary, when the 

24 beneficiary's money is at stake, is entitled to see what 

advice the government acted on in dealing with its

1 money. 

2  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is this true regardless of 

3 the fact that the government may have a very powerful 

4 interest in seeking neutral, independent advice from an 

attorney, and that were you to prevail that advice would 

6 become watered down? 

7  MR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor. I don't -- I 

8 submit that the ultimate balancing of interests here is 

9 the same as it is for a private fiduciary. There is no 

-- the Court -- we urge the Court to affirm that under 

11 Rule 501 Indian tribes are entitled to the same evidence 

12 as other trust beneficiaries about how their money was 

13 managed. That is our request of this Court. 

14  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The trustee I guess 

is -- is broadly conceived of as the government? 

16  MR. GORDON: Yes, Your Honor. 

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't the 

18 lawyer working for the trustee then a trustee too, an 

19 employee of the trustee?

 MR. GORDON: I think that may in a 

21 theoretical sense be true, Your Honor. But practically 

22 speaking, there's a difference between the BIA officials 

23 who are acting as the trustee and the attorneys who are 

24 advising the trustee. Our claim is against the trustee.

8  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH 

9  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SHAH: Your Honor, if I can just make 

11 three -- three points on rebuttal. 

12  The first is with respect to Federal Rule of 

13 Evidence 501. The government is not implementing any 

14 trick here. This is not a "heads you win, tails you 

lose" type situation. Our argument is simple. We look 

16 to -- we invoke a valid attorney-client privilege. The 

17 other side invokes a common law exception to that 

18 privilege. Our argument is not that no common law 

19 exception is applicable to the government. It's simply 

that the basis for this common law exception is not 

21 applicable, so the exception should not be applicable. 

22 It's a very straightforward argument. 

23  The second point I would like to make is in 

24 response to the contention that we have a full-fledged 

trust here as opposed to a bare trust in Mitchell. I'm 

48

1 not quite sure what "a full-fledged trust" means in the 

2 Indian trust context. Certainly there's specific 

3 investment-related duties that the statute sets forth 

4 with respect to trust funds, but this Court has made 

clear in -- in Mitchell and reiterated in the Navajo 

6 Nation decision that it's not enough for the statute to 

7 simply set forth the statutory duties, but it must 

8 define, and this is a quote, "define the contours of 

9 those duties."

 The statutes at issue, section 161a, 162a, 

11 do nothing of the sort. They don't even set out a 

12 general disclosure obligation, let alone the contours of 

13 any such disclosure obligation. But even if we were to 

14 disregard this Court's precedents in Mitchell and in 

Navajo Nation, and we were to resort to the common law 

16 to flesh out the nature of the responsibilities, again 

17 there's nothing from the discrete investment obligations 

18 that are set forth in those statutes that would lead to 

19 a general disclosure obligation, let alone an intrusive 

obligation to disclose the government's attorney-client 

21 communications. 

22  And there's good reasons to think that 

23 Congress did not apply such an obligation when it has 

24 set forth a fairly reticulated statutory and regulatory 

regime governing disclosures, and with respect to other 

49

1 statutes. For example, the 1982 Indian Claims 

2 Limitation Act specifically addressed privileged versus 

3 nonprivileged information. 

4  The last point I would make goes to the 

general duty to disclose. Whether that's contingent 

6 simply on payment, ownership or other factors. While it 

7 may not be the case that the payment is the sole factor, 

8 it's certainly an important factor, and I think as my 

9 friend responded in response to Justice Kennedy, if in 

fact the private trustee is paying for the legal advice 

11 on their own, that's going to be a significant 

12 consideration as to whether the beneficiary can get it. 

13  And as Justice Scalia pointed out, the lines 

14 are not always going to be clear between trust 

administration advice and liability advice. In fact, 

16 they're often going to run into one another. 

17  Beyond payment, I think the even more 

18 important factor here is the ownership of the records. 

19 While payment is indicative of ownership, when we're 

talking about the government context, payment is not the 

21 only reason why we say that the government owns the 

22 records that result from legal advice or any other trust 

23 administration facet. That's set forth by statute and 

24 regulation, the Federal Records Act, and the Interior 

Department regulations that are set forth in the

1 appendix of the brief. The reason why I think -­

2  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If I -- if I pay -­

3 if I pay a lawyer to prepare a document for me, is 

4 that -- I do own that document or does the lawyer?

 MR. SHAH: I think as a general -- I think 

6 as a general matter, one would think that the client 

7 would -- it would belong to the client, at least in the 

8 sense that the client would have full access to that 

9 document.

 And I think that's a fundamental distinction 

11 here, that we're not -- because the -- these are 

12 governmental records, they're subject to the statutory 

13 and regulatory regime that governs disclosure of 

14 government documents, either specific disclosure 

obligations set forth by Congress, Interior Department 

16 regulation or the more general Freedom of Information 

17 Act. 

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But aren't you 

19 confusing, just following up on the Chief Justice's, 

ownership with access? FOIA itself doesn't make these 

21 records less -- the government doesn't own them less 

22 merely because FOIA requires them to share it with other 

23 people. So the ownership interest is not the defining 

24 legal obligation.

 MR. SHAH: You're absolutely correct. The

1 fact that they're accessible by FOIA does not -- does 

2 not change the government's ownership of those records, 

3 but the fact that Congress is able to set forth a scheme 

4 like FOIA is turned on the fact that these are 

government records that are owned by the government. 

6  Because they're government records, it's 

7 Congress and it's the Interior Department that decides 

8 when to disclose them and under what circumstances to 

9 disclose them. The tribe's rule here would eviscerate 

that very reticulated statutory and regulatory regime.
