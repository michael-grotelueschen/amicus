 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 09-530, National Aeronautics 

and Space Administration v. Nelson.

 Mr. Katyal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL NEAL K. KATYAL

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 GENERAL KATYAL: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 Background checks are a standard way of 

doing business. The Government has required them for 

all civil service employees since 1953 and for 

contractors since 2005. If the Ninth Circuit in this 

case held that a constitutional right to informational 

privacy precluded asking the questions it asked, that 

was wrong for two basic reasons.

 First, the background checks' mere 

collection of information with accompanying safeguards 

vitiates no constitutional privacy interest. These 

checks have been going on for millions of employees for 

dozens of years. They are part of the employment 

process. They are manifestly not roving checks on 

random individuals. And, second -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Katyal, is there any

limit to what questions the Government can ask --

GENERAL KATYAL: Well, the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- an applicant?

 GENERAL KATYAL: The -- the limits are -- in 

this case, are the ones on SF-85 and Form 42. And we do 

think that that's a fairly --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What does that mean?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, those two --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you ask somebody, 

what's your genetic make-up, because we don't want 

people with a gene that's predisposed to cancer, 

whatever other -- could you ask that?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think that the 

Court doesn't need to confront that fairly --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We do, because I have to 

start with the question of what are the limits on the 

Government, if any? Are you taking the position that, 

as an employer, there are absolutely none, or are you 

taking the position that there are some, and what would 

they be?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Our position is, in a case 

such as this, where there are collections on the 

Government's dissemination of the information --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So what you are saying 

is, there's no limit?

GENERAL KATYAL: I -- I think that this 

Court in Whalen -- and there is no decision thus far 

that has recognized any constitutional limit on the 

Government's collection of information, so long as there 

are accompanying safeguards on the disseminations and --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: General Katyal, why are 

we getting into this? Because this case, it seems to 

me, is a challenge -- your challenge to a preliminary 

injunction which was quite narrow. There was only one 

question at issue. There is no cross-appeal, is there?

 GENERAL KATYAL: There -- there is no 

cross-appeal.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So we have Form 85. The 

only thing that's in contention there is the question 

about treatment or counseling. Nothing else. So why 

are we talking about the universe of what questions 

might be asked?

 And on the other form, I take it, it's just 

the so-called open-ended questions, not everything on 

the form.

 GENERAL KATYAL: I quite agree, Justice 

Ginsburg. That's what I was trying to say to Justice 

Sotomayor; that is, I think that this case doesn't force 

the Court to answer questions it has never really 

answered, which are the outer limits of what the

Government can do in terms of the collection of 

information.

 Here you have a narrow decision by the Ninth 

Circuit, one whose reasoning, I think, could radiate 

very broadly and undermine Government -- the 

Government's background checks generally.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, what do you think has 

been -- there hasn't been a formal injunction entered, a 

preliminary -- a preliminary injunction, has there?

 GENERAL KATYAL: It's only -- it's at the 

preliminary injunction stage.

 But our -- our point is that the reasoning 

that the Ninth Circuit used, if adopted -- if adopted to 

create a permanent injunction, could preclude the 

Government from asking all sorts of questions in 

background -- in background checks, not just the ones it 

isolated here, but more general ones, because the Ninth 

Circuit decision is essentially a how-to manual on how 

to question, various individual questions, and 

micromanage them and inject Federal courts into --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought the -- the 

entire Form 85 was approved, and there's no question you 

could ask about, have you used drugs within the last 

year? It's only the question about treatment and 

counseling that's -- that is at issue, right?

GENERAL KATYAL: That's -- that's all that 

the Ninth Circuit ruled on at the preliminary injunction 

stage.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Does that -- does 

that ruling stop you from asking that question right now 

throughout the Ninth Circuit?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Which question? The drug 

treatment question?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, no, no. The --

yes. Yes, the counseling and treatment question.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, there's a -- the 

mandate has been stayed --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right.

 GENERAL KATYAL: -- so we haven't been able 

to --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But if we sustained 

-- if we sustain the preliminary injunction, the 

Government can't ask that question throughout the --

the -- the reach of the Ninth Circuit?

 GENERAL KATYAL: That's exactly correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and if we did so, 

it would be because there is an underlying privacy right 

that's somewhat ill-defined or undefined?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Exactly, Justice Kennedy. 

And if this Court were to embrace that reasoning -- and

this is my answer to you, Justice Ginsburg, as well --

then it doesn't just reach drug treatment. I could 

imagine other litigants doing it for other forms of 

questions, whatever they may be.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the -- the circuit 

precedent, as far as the other questions on Form 85 --

the circuit said that's okay. It's permissible to ask 

those questions.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Thus far, that's correct. 

But I could imagine other litigants coming in, and maybe 

not just with respect to these questions but questions 

on SF-85P or Form 86, any number of other things.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Katyal, what is the 

well-defined, the well-defined, constitutional right to 

institutional -- to informational privacy that the 

Government is -- is willing to acknowledge? You -- you 

apparently don't -- don't challenge the existence of 

such a constitutional right.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, our 

position is that the Court doesn't need to answer that 

question. It's just like Whalen, because in Whalen this 

Court assumed the existence of some sort of 

constitutional right and then said: Is that right 

violated here?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a strange way to

proceed. We normally don't do that, see? If there were 

a constitutional right, would it cover this?

 GENERAL KATYAL: I agree --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do we do that in cases? I 

don't think so.

 GENERAL KATYAL: I agree that in many other 

contexts, it might not be appropriate, but here I think 

there are some good reasons why. This Court has had 

special reticence to the rule broadly in the range of 

privacy, and I think the reason is privacy is something 

that is in flux in ways that other things aren't, both 

in terms of our social understandings, technology, and 

legislation itself.

 And for that reason, I think this Court has 

spoken narrowly whenever it's dealt with --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That would justify not 

defining it broadly or narrowly. It wouldn't justify 

not reaching the question of whether there is any such 

constitutional right at all.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Scalia, that's what 

this Court has done throughout its history. And Whalen 

was a unanimous decision, and Nixon, on that particular 

question, I don't think there was a disagreement about. 

So --

JUSTICE ALITO: How can the Court determine

that the right is not violated here without having some 

idea about either the existence or the contours of the 

right?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I think it would just 

be like in Whalen itself. So in Whalen, the Court said 

there might be some right to informational privacy, but 

so long as there are safeguards on the disclosure, the 

Government's dissemination of the information, that 

means that there is no --

JUSTICE ALITO: Is it -- is it your argument 

that the Government can collect whatever information it 

wants from private individuals so long as the 

information is not publicly disseminated?

 GENERAL KATYAL: No, that's not our 

position. Our position here is that the Government can 

collect information so long as it is not disseminated in 

the employment context. And this case, unlike Whalen, 

is one that has that added fact to it, that the 

Government here is asking --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, does it -- does it 

help us in finding what this residual background right 

is and asking you: Why is it that you can't disclose 

it?

 GENERAL KATYAL: I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why can't you disseminate

the information?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Surely -- we are restricted 

by statute, the privacy of --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let's assume no statute.

 GENERAL KATYAL: If you assume --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, this is 

just testing whether there is some background 

constitutional right and how to define it, if we have to 

use that as a beginning premise.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely. If we took out 

all of the safeguards that are at issue here, then the 

case wouldn't be like Whalen or Nixon, in which you had 

those -- in which you had safeguards in the 

dissemination. And then you would have to confront the 

question, which we think you shouldn't confront in this 

case, for the reasons I said to Justice Scalia.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what would be your 

position if the -- all this information were disclosed? 

Or that there was an attempt to disclose all the 

information, and they asked you for your advice --

GENERAL KATYAL: Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- on a constitutional 

basis?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Right. I mean, our 

position is that the Court really shouldn't, for all of

the reasons I said, get into it, but if the Court had to 

get into it and ask is there some constitutional right 

that would be violated, Justice Kennedy, by your 

hypothetical, our answer would be no.

 But we do think the way that this has been 

traditionally been handled is legislation. Safeguards 

for political processes --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So when you say your 

position would be no, you mean that there is no right of 

any kind under -- I know you don't want us to reach it, 

but you would say there is no right of any kind for a 

citizen to tell the Government that that's none of your 

business. The Government will decide that it can ask 

anything of a citizen, so long as you don't disclose it.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, in the 

employment/proprietor context. Okay? So if the Court 

had to confront that question, it would apply the matrix 

that Justice Scalia has talked about, the Glucksberg 

matrix, of whether a right -- the right is firmly rooted 

in the traditions of the people, and -- and ask: Is the 

Government's collection --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think it's 

firmly rooted in our traditions that there is some right 

to tell the Government that's none of your business?

 GENERAL KATYAL: I think there is some

right. The question about whether it employs in the 

unique employment/proprietor context is one the Court 

hasn't confronted, and our strong -- our strong position 

here is the Court shouldn't confront it.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What is the test -- what is 

the test for determining what sort of questions can be 

asked in the employment context? Is there any limit?

 Suppose the -- suppose the Government says, 

well, we want to know all about your diet; we want to 

know whether you smoke cigarettes; we want to know 

everything you read; we want to know what your hobbies 

are, what forms of entertainment you enjoy, sexual 

practices, every aspect of your private life, just 

because that gives us a better picture of who you are as 

an employee. Is that okay?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Sure. No, there are 

limits, and I should have said this earlier. If the 

Government's collection of information or the disclosure 

of the information burdens some other fundamental 

constitutional right, that is certainly one limit.

 So if the Government were collecting 

information, Justice Alito, on sexual practices of its 

employees, it may burden the exercise of other rights.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yes, but that's 

putting those aside. I mean, what about some of the

hypotheticals that Justice Alito posed? Your diet?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Right. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's certainly 

relevant in the employment context, right? They're 

going to have to pay for your health care, worry you 

might miss things, miss days of work.

 So I guess the point is: Do you think the 

Government's right to inquire in the employment context 

is exactly as broad as a private employer's right?

 GENERAL KATYAL: I do think that if the 

private employer -- the private employers are a good 

template. If the Government is simply mirroring what 

private employers do, as Justice Scalia said in O'Connor 

v. Ortega, that's a good suggestion that what it's doing 

is reasonable.

 Now, to the extent, Justice Alito, that they 

are gradating far beyond what private employers do, in 

terms of asking about eating habits and the like, I do 

think that that may pose -- that there may be some 

limits. The Court doesn't need to confront that here. 

It simply needs to look at the Ninth Circuit's decision, 

which recognize a broad, free-standing right against 

informational collection of its employees to make sure 

and -- and realize that that is a serious problem for 

the way the Government does business.

JUSTICE SCALIA: We do have a legislature, 

don't we, that can place some limits on what the 

Government asks employees or anybody else?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the same legislature 

that prohibited the Government from disclosing a lot of 

information, isn't it?

 GENERAL KATYAL: That's precisely correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it's possible that 

that's the protection that the Framers envisioned, 

rather than having courts ride herd on -- on Government 

inquiries.

 GENERAL KATYAL: It's certainly possible, 

Justice Scalia. I think that all of these hypotheticals 

are enormously interesting, but the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Were these two forms 

approved by Congress?

 GENERAL KATYAL: The forms themselves were 

not approved by Congress, but the Privacy Act, which is 

the main restriction --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's a restriction on 

disclosure, but the same Congress can change that, 

correct?

 GENERAL KATYAL: That's absolutely correct. 

The Privacy Act has been around since 1975, and the

Government has collected -- you know, it's been used 

millions of times, SF-85. It's been used 553,000 times 

in the last 4 years, and we have not seen the types of 

disclosure or complaints that I think animate the worry 

that my friends on the other side are saying.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is the 

reason -- I've had trouble putting my finger on it --

that you need the information about counseling?

 You already have the information, have you 

used drugs in the past year? I couldn't tell if you 

thought the question about counseling was for the good 

of the employee -- oh, you are taking steps to -- or was 

it to allow you to show, well, it must be serious, 

because you need counseling.

 GENERAL KATYAL: It is for the good of the 

employee, so it's a --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, now that's --

whenever the Government comes and says this is for your 

own good, you have to be --

(Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- you have to be a 

little suspicious.

 I mean, if it's -- the employee gets to 

expand upon his or her answer. They say, tell us about 

it. And they can say, don't worry, I'm in counseling or

treatment. And even then, that doesn't sound like it's 

for their good. It's one thing to say, I had a drink. 

It's another thing to say, I'm in AA.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Mr. Chief Justice, the way 

the question is framed is, first, they are asked, have 

you used illegal drugs in the last year? And then --

and then, if the answer is yes, provide details and then 

indicate any treatment or counseling received.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Now, I had a 

question about the way it's worded. You're supposed --

it says, if you've used it in the last year, detail your 

involvement with drugs and any counseling you received.

 Do you understand the counseling question to 

be limited to the past year, or to reach back as far 

as --

GENERAL KATYAL: I -- I think that the 

question itself is vague.

 Now, the way that our -- that the Office of 

Personnel Management will process such a form is it will 

process anything so long as there is information about 

just drug use on the question --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But do you think 

it's required? I mean, you do sign at the end, this is 

true to the best -- do you think it's required to 

disclose counseling and treatment you received more than

a year back?

 GENERAL KATYAL: No. This is unlike, for 

example, SF-86, which does ask for treatment and 

counseling back up to, I think, a 7-year period.

 So I think this is a much more narrow 

inquiry, and I think the reason for that inquiry is to 

help the employee. The Government -- the background 

investigation --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The answer to that is 

obvious. It was raised by the other side. If it's for 

the good of the employee, make it voluntary.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

think that that's the type -- that that's the type of 

inquiry that this Court rejected in Whalen. Because in 

Whalen, the whole debate in the court, in the district 

court below, was, well, if you want to stop doctor 

prescription mills people from providing too many 

narcotics, you don't need the names and ages of the 

patients. We could change the triplicate forms and 

redact that.

 But what this Court said on the second page 

of its opinion was it called that Lochnerian, that 

Federal courts shouldn't be policing forms and excising 

or suggesting random different -- you know, a few 

different words here or there.

And here, experts put this form together to 

try and get at, basically, are you using drugs and are 

you using treatment which might ameliorate the fact that 

you had used illegal drugs in the last year.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I had thought before 

the argument that one of the purposes for asking about 

treatment was to identify employees who may have 

undergone treatment on numerous occasions and dropped 

out of programs and been unsuccessful, so as to identify 

chronic drug abusers. But I guess in light of what 

you've just said, that this only reaches back 1 year, 

that is not a purpose of this -- this question.

 GENERAL KATYAL: That is correct, and in 

preparation for this, we did survey all of the NASA 

different centers to ask, has treatment ever been used 

in any sort of way to hurt an employee? And the answer 

that came back was, no, it has not been used. It has 

only been used to help. It is to retain someone who did 

use illegal drugs but is taking steps to mitigate.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, how do you 

know -- how do you know that? I mean, you ask a lot of 

questions on these forms, and they say, well, we're not 

going to hire you. How can you go back and say it was 

because you put in, you know, in treatment for -- for 

drug abuse?

GENERAL KATYAL: Well, the process by which 

this takes place is the form is filled out. It is 

ultimately sent to an adjudicator if there is negative 

information, and that -- and that information is then 

discussed with the candidate for employment or the 

employee to see if they have an explanation. And of the 

times that this has happened, that someone has been 

denied -- and I think the number is 128 times over the 

-- over the last 5 years -- none have been denied for a 

positive answer to drug treatment.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Over the last 5 

years, this has only come into play 128 times across the 

Federal bureaucracy?

 GENERAL KATYAL: For Federal contractors. 

That is correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Federal contractors.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. I'm not sure 

I understand the answer. Only 128 times has somebody 

identified themselves as a drug user?

 GENERAL KATYAL: One hundred and 

twenty-eight times, the SF-85 process, is my 

understanding, has been used to deny someone a 

credential of the Federal contractor --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So it could be for any

other answers as well?

 GENERAL KATYAL: For anything. Exactly. 

About -- and I think there have been about 74,000 

contractors that have sought -- sought badges through 

the SF-85 since --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you representing to 

us that every employee who is rejected will know the 

reason?

 GENERAL KATYAL: That is correct. That is 

part of -- that is part of the regulations that are in 

place, so that if someone is denied a credential -- and 

this is, I think, at Joint Appendix page 180 -- they are 

told the reason for that denial. They are given an 

opportunity to explain themselves, and a process is then 

put in place. There is then also robust appeal and 

other things that may happen as well.

 But one thing that doesn't happen, Justice 

Sotomayor, is that JPL, the contractor, is not told the 

basis for why the person is denied a credential, that it 

is private as between the Government -- here, NASA --

and the individual employee. And that is the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So where does the 

suitability matrix come in?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And NASA has never used 

it? You're representing that to the Court?

 GENERAL KATYAL: I'm representing that NASA 

has -- NASA will not and does not use this employee 

suitability chart to make contractor credentialing 

decisions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where did it come from?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, it's -- it's been 

hard to actually pin down where it came from. I think 

it is derived from earlier Office of Personnel 

Management materials at a time when it listed out what 

various crimes were. And so some of those things that 

are on there that are quite salacious are things that 

OPM, at earlier points in time, looked to, not for 

contractors, but for Government employees.

 But I can represent to the Court that NASA 

does not and will not use this chart for credentialing 

decisions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you -- do you have a 

clear idea of how the Form 42 would have to be amended 

if the Respondents are correct? Form 85, we know, is 

the excised "counseling or treatment." What in the Form 

85 did the Ninth Circuit say -- it said "open-ended 

questions," but I looked at the form, and it's not clear

to me which ones they considered open-ended.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, I quite 

agree with you. I don't think that the Ninth Circuit's 

reasoning is capable of being ameliorated easily.

 So we talked before about how the drug 

treatment was just a narrow part of the Ninth Circuit 

decision, but this Form 42 -- the invalidation of Form 

42, goes to the heart of what the Government does all 

the time and what all employers do. They ask open-ended 

questions to figure out whether someone is trustworthy 

and reliable. I think as Judge --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: General -- I'm sorry. 

Go ahead and finish.

 GENERAL KATYAL: I think as Judge Kleinfeld 

said, that's how law clerks are hired, and that's how 

baristas at Starbucks are hired. You have to ask these 

open-ended questions because as an employer, you don't 

really know what -- where the pressure points or danger 

spots in an individual application are.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is your position today 

that our ruling should say that the Government is free 

to ask, as a private employer or a contractor -- it is 

free to ask any question it wants whatsoever?

 GENERAL KATYAL: That is not what we're 

saying. We --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you were not saying 

that, then what's the narrower ruling? Because that's 

what I thought I heard at the beginning of our colloquy 

today.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Sotomayor, the 

narrow rule is what we said in our petition and what we 

said on the very last page of our reply brief and all 

throughout, which is, this Court should simply say what 

it said in Whalen, which is assuming that there is some 

sort of right to informational privacy, the -- the use 

of a background check with accompanying safeguards to 

collect information doesn't violate any constitutional 

right to privacy.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, why wouldn't that 

violate it if the question involved a fundamental right? 

If you were asking the question that Justice Alito 

asked, which is, what's your sexual practices in the 

bedroom, if there are security checks against you 

disclosing it, you're saying even that would be okay?

 GENERAL KATYAL: I could imagine a 

circumstance far afield from this one in which the 

Government's just mere collection of information about 

sexual practices might burden the exercise of those 

rights. I'm saying it's not at all present here, but --

and I don't think the Court should get into it.

But that's a really different question than 

the one here, which is: Is there some free-standing 

right to constitutional privacy that is unburdened by 

the fact that there are protections against the 

disclosure of information? Here, the Privacy Act 

imposes strong protections against the disclosure of 

information. And so what's left is a very residual 

interest in the part of the employees.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Don't -- this is a bit 

unsatisfying because you start by saying to us, as long 

as there are some nondisclosure protections, then 

virtually any question, whether it impinges a 

fundamental right or not, would be okay, because 

there's -- I don't even know what the Government's 

interest is in asking every question it wants to.

 There has to be a need for a set of 

questions, doesn't there?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, I could imagine an 

as-applied challenge to, for example, you know, the 

hypothetical on sexual practices or whatever.

 I do think, as Justice Scalia said, the real 

check on that is the political process check. The fact 

is that the Government doesn't ask those kinds of 

questions, and -- and to the extent it ever did, the 

Court could confront that in an as-applied challenge.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I still don't see why 

that -- why the universe is before us, because the Ninth 

Circuit said some of this form is okay; most of Form 85 

is okay, and some of Form 42 is okay. I thought it was 

only the questions under 7 and 8, the open-ended 

questions. I didn't think the Ninth Circuit had 

enjoined anything other than those questions.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Those questions, 

Justice Ginsburg, are really the heart of the form. I 

mean, those are the most -- in many ways the most 

important questions, because they're the ones that 

employers have to ask because they don't know the 

weaknesses in an individual applicant's background.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There are a number of 

statements in, I guess, the concurrence from the denial 

of en banc, explaining how JPL is fairly open, and it is 

close to the Pasadena courthouse. Pasadena residents 

and judges visit JPL often.

 Are there any statements of fact that you 

don't agree with that are not in the record, other than 

the matrix question? Leave that aside.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, yes, I mean, I would 

say a few things. Number one is I think that the 

concurring judge did -- did, I think, underestimate how 

important security is there.

First of all, there are armed guards when 

you're coming in. It is not the campus-like atmosphere. 

It's not like a campus I'm familiar that she described. 

The information at the debate -- at JPL is sensitive, 

quite sensitive, both, you know, in terms of 

scientifically and with respect to our nation's secrets.

 And I think more important point about this 

is the badge that the Plaintiffs were seeking access to 

don't -- doesn't just give them access to JPL. It will 

also give them other access to all other NASA 

facilities. And it's such an important credential that 

it would allow them to get within, for example, 6 to 10 

feet of the space shuttle as it's being repaired and 

readied for launch. So this is a credential not just 

for JPL and getting onto JPL, but other places as well.

 If I could reserve the balance of my time.

positions that do not involve sensitive issues, 

classified issues, national security issues, or 

positions of public trust?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Stormer, what provision 

of the Constitution are you relying -- I looked at your 

table of authorities in your brief, and you have cases 

listed, you have statutes listed; there is not a single 

citation anywhere in your brief to a provision of the 

Constitution.

 What provision of the Constitution are you 

relying on?

 MR. STORMER: It would mostly fall --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's a very nice 

thing that the Government shouldn't ask intrusive 

questions. I also think it's a nice thing that the 

Government should pay a living wage to its employees, 

but I don't feel authorized to go around saying how much 

the Government should pay each of its employees because 

there is nothing in the Constitution about that, and the 

question is left to Congress.

 What do you rely on in the Constitution that 

enables me to decide how much intrusiveness is too much, 

rather than leaving that to Congress?

 MR. STORMER: It would flow from the ordered 

concept of liberty component of the Fifth Amendment, as

well as the First Amendment.

Which says no person shall be deprived of what?

 MR. STORMER: Of life -- I mean, no person 

shall be deprived of due process of law, and then the 

last --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Due process of law.

 MR. STORMER: -- refers to the concept of --

ordered concept of liberty.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. That -- that's 

what I thought. You're talking substantive due process 

here.

 MR. STORMER: Well, the Whalen case, the 

Nixon case, and to some extent, the Reporters Committee 

case refer to this concept of privacy. And they are, in 

fact, vague, but they do talk about the concept of 

privacy as being the right to control information about 

oneself.

 And -- and both -- and all of the --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, I like that, but I 

just don't see it anywhere in the Constitution. That's 

all I'm taking about.

 MR. STORMER: Well, I -- there -- those 

cases, in fact, do not refer to a term called 

"informational privacy." Those terms have grown from

the various cases that have flowed from the 

determinations in Whalen and Nixon and, to some extent, 

Reporters Committee.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that right is subject 

to what level of scrutiny? Is it always strict 

scrutiny? And how do you square Whalen and Nixon's 

balancing with strict scrutiny?

 MR. STORMER: The -- the standard would 

be -- I think the appropriate standard was applied by 

the Ninth Circuit, which is a legitimate state interest 

narrowly tailored to meet that need.

 In this case, there is some -- like the Von 

Raab case, which is not cited in our brief but which is 

a Fourth Amendment case, the -- this Court used a 

compelling state interest standard for a Fourth 

Amendment invasion. And in that case, the Court 

remanded on the issue of whether or not the positions 

involved classified or sensitive materials.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So what is your view of 

what the liberty -- you're saying that the words in the 

Constitution that protect the right that you claim was 

violated are the words, "No person shall be" -- I 

guess -- "deprived of life, liberty, or property, 

without due process of law." I guess you mean the word 

"liberty."

have to be justified. Is that -- is that your theory?

 MR. STORMER: Any intrusion into private 

lives would have to have some --

JUSTICE BREYER: It says "liberty." The 

liberty, you said, was liberty to control information 

about yourself.

 MR. STORMER: That was the --

JUSTICE BREYER: So I want to know how that 

works. Every time anyone in the Government asks a 

question about you personally -- of course, it wouldn't 

be unconstitutional -- but every time it would have to 

be a justified thing; is that -- is that your theory? 

I'm just asking.

information about yourself?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, I'm talking 

about -- answer his broad question, which is -- you've 

defined the constitutional right to information about 

yourself.

 MR. STORMER: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Is that all information 

about yourself, including your date of birth, your 

Social Security number, your -- where you live, where 

you've gone to school, who your friends, who your 

references are? Because as broadly as you've defined 

that, it would include all of that.

 MR. STORMER: It -- the -- the nature of 

what is included can be intruded upon based upon a 

governmental need. So if there's a rational basis for 

knowing Social Security numbers, driver's license, 

census information, that type of information, then --

then there's not an issue.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this gets back to 

Justice Sotomayor's earlier question. You just said if 

there is a rational basis, so is that the test?

 MR. STORMER: The test --

of information? I suppose it's harder to show a

rational basis when you get into certain areas that --

 MR. STORMER: In this case, I think it's a 

legitimate state interest, narrowly tailored to meet 

that interest, Your Honor. It's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But in the case of a 

date of birth for a driver's license, you say it's 

rational basis?

 MR. STORMER: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And so, what -- how do we 

decide? I'm a little interested, if you could spend 2 

or 3 minutes elaborating this.

 A number of laws, Federal laws -- I imagine 

the regulations fill this room, and I think many --

maybe more, maybe several rooms. And many of them 

involve asking people for information. And the number 

of forms that ask people for information, I guess, about 

themselves, might fill several rooms. And I can imagine 

in a country of 300 million people, you would find 

someone objecting to many of the questions.

 And so, how is the system supposed to work, 

in your view, where judges will decide whether a 

particular question -- I'm not saying you're wrong. I 

just wanted to get an idea from you as to how this legal 

system works, where any question asked by the Government

about a person is potentially subject to challenge as 

unconstitutional. You and I will agree that many are 

fine. But you are worried about some that aren't fine.

 How does it work, the system, distinguishing 

the ones from the other?

 MR. STORMER: Well, this Court has done much 

of that already in a whole history of cases: 

Contraception, procreation, marriage, sexual relations, 

family relations --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The fundamental rights 

issue that the Sixth Amendment identified, are those the 

questions that are subject to that greater scrutiny?

 MR. STORMER: The -- the rights that go --

the questions that go to those types of -- which could 

elicit that type of information.

 For instance, on Form 42, if they said, tell 

us any adverse information you have about this person, 

which includes any other matters. This could be -- they 

could respond with saying, well, I don't like the way 

he -- how many kids he has; I don't like his religion; I 

don't like his sexual practices.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't that question, 

that kind of open-ended question, routinely used in 

employment situations? That is, the employer wants to 

know is there any adverse information about this person?

Doesn't know which question to ask, because there's a 

whole -- many things that could be relevant.

 So are you suggesting that that kind of 

question is off-limits to the Government, although it is 

routinely used in other employment sectors?

 MR. STORMER: It is not routinely used in 

employment sectors where there is allowed to inquiry --

inquiry into non-employment-related --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, it has a legend on 

the top. Everything that we are asking you is meant 

to -- to determine suitability for employment. So they 

want to find out information relevant to suitability for 

employment.

 MR. STORMER: And for security clearances. 

Those are the two issues.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I have to agree 

with the implication of Justice Ginsburg's remark, at 

least what I imply from it.

 Look at the private employment sphere. It 

seems to me that for a sensitive position, a bank who 

has people taking care of -- its employees taking care 

of other people's money, or the medical profession, that 

the employer could be sued and would be remiss if it did 

not ask this question.

 Do you know anything adverse about this

person whom we're going to hire for a very sensitive 

position?

 MR. STORMER: That --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: This is done all the time, 

and we do it with -- a judge said below, with our law 

clerks.

 MR. STORMER: That would be exactly my 

point, Your Honor. It is in those situations where 

there are sensitive issues, you're allowed to inquire 

based on the need.

 But here, they are inquiring -- the snack 

bar worker, the -- the bus driver, the gift shop 

operator, are -- are required to respond to these 

questions. The GS-4 Interior Department clerk. The 

Government's position is all of those are subject to 

this same type of inquiry.

 JUSTICE ALITO: I don't see what the 

alternative, as a practical matter, is to asking this 

sort of open-ended question. The -- the alternative 

would seem to be to try to compile a list of every 

possible thing that the -- the person might do that 

would raise serious questions about suitability for 

employment or would be disqualifying for employment. 

And that seems to be impractical.

 There's almost no limit to the -- the sorts

of things that might be relevant in that respect; isn't 

that right?

 MR. STORMER: This goes to the very basic 

question of why does the Government need to know this 

information for these individuals, most of whom have 

been there for 20 to 30 years? The Government can't 

show a single instance of any of these individuals doing 

anything that would require any of the type of 

scrutiny --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you then saying that 

these people have to be grandfathered or grandparented 

because they worked for 20 years --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- without --

MR. STORMER: I am not, Your Honor. But the 

Government has some burden to show a need to inquire 

into these privacy areas. It needs to know if you have 

gone to the Betty Ford Clinic.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you are making a --

you said that these people have worked there for 

20 years. Are they different from the new employee? 

Are you suggesting it's okay for the new employee, but 

not okay --

MR. STORMER: I am not.

already in the job?

 MR. STORMER: I -- I am not. The -- the 

difference between this case and, ultimately, what was 

allowed in both Whalen and Nixon -- excuse me, 

particularly in Whalen -- is that there was some 

overarching societal need to have this information.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose the person who 

works at the -- at the gift shop or the snack bar -- I 

think that's what you mentioned -- has a big sign on his 

front lawn that says, "I hope the space shuttle blows 

up."

 Is that information the Government has a 

legitimate reason to get?

 MR. STORMER: I would agree that -- that in 

that instance, "I hope the space shuttle blows up," 

would certainly implicate some First Amendment issues, 

but the Government should know that information.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And now, what's the 

alternative to acquiring that information through an 

open-ended question? You have to have a specific 

question on the form: Does this individual have a big 

sign on his front lawn that says --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- "I hope the space shuttle 

blows up"?

JUSTICE ALITO: Do you see what I am getting 

at? I don't see how you are going to do this, other 

than by asking an open-ended question.

 MR. STORMER: Only if you need to know the 

answers. And for the snack bar worker or the GS 

clerk-typist, for those types of people who have no 

access to sensitive information, do not -- it can -- the 

definition here is that these are no- or low-risk --

they are low-risk employees, which is defined as, if 

they misuse their position, they will have little or no 

impact on the agency mission.

 So we know that these questions are being 

asked of people who, if they completely misused their 

position, there will be no impact --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- just to -- I'd 

like to get back to Justice Breyer's question.

 So now you not only have to decide which 

questions -- they can challenge any question they want 

and say this isn't pertinent, but you also have to 

categorize which employees are being asked that 

question.

 This is a -- SF means "standard form," 

right?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that -- you 

know, it's a big government, and they can't tailor every 

inquiry, every form, to the individual applicant.

 MR. STORMER: It -- it can to the positions. 

This -- this -- what is being done now, if they've done 

70,000 inquiries, that means -- and 128 issues arose, 

that means a whole host of people, over 69,000 people, 

have had to give up information that otherwise they 

would not have to give up --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Are you suggesting 

that this is no good for Government employment? You 

were dealing with a contractor here, but this form, as I 

understand it, has been used for -- for many years for 

standard Government employment.

 Is it -- are they okay? And for 

nonsensitive positions, are you -- are you arguing just 

Government contractor or are you saying even for the 

Government employee, the person who's hired to work at 

the snack bar in the Senate, let's say, the Government 

can't ask these questions?

 MR. STORMER: If I understand Your Honor's 

question, and I apologize, I -- I think this cannot be 

asked of -- these questions cannot be asked of people 

for whom the Government does not have a justifiable need

to know that information.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But we can handle those 

details. My goodness, it's all right there in the 

Constitution. And we can decide what -- what employees 

have to know what, and what questions you can ask them, 

and how much privacy is too much privacy, right?

 MR. STORMER: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a piece of cake.

 MR. STORMER: The Government is -- claims to 

be acting as the employer here. In fact, it is not. It 

is -- it's once or twice removed. But assuming that the 

Government is the employer, there is a massive amount of 

waste that is generated by this form.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You are -- you are 

attacking these forms for all Government employment, not 

just the contractors?

 MR. STORMER: I -- I don't -- it -- I think 

it would apply to all of those people who are in 

nonsensitive positions. This is the Government's 

definition; it's not our definition. We chose the 

Government's definition.

 And if it is a low-risk or a no-risk 

employee, then the Government doesn't have a need to 

know. A private employer could not --

you find out what he -- he or she is like or what the 

neighbor thinks. Well, you know, he keeps practicing 

planting bombs or something. I mean, then he becomes a 

high-risk employee. You don't know until you get the 

information. That's the reason you ask for it.

 MR. STORMER: In the context of these 

employees for this particular case, we absolutely know, 

because the Government went through, and of the 7,500 

employees there, it categorized 97 percent as low- or 

no-risk employees. So, we know in this context where 

they are already employed and it's just a badging 

procedure. What the Government did here --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. I thought -- I 

thought that your friend said that the badge enables you 

to get within 10 feet of the shuttle?

 MR. STORMER: I don't know that for a fact. 

I do know that --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, do you contradict 

that? And if it's so, how can you say that these people 

are low-risk employees?

 MR. STORMER: Because the Government says 

they are low- or no-risk employees.

to that, Your Honor, is that it wouldn't matter if they 

knew this, because it's open, transparent science by a 

civilian agency in a campus atmosphere. This is not

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What you're 

saying -- what you're saying is it may not make much 

sense to have the people here fill out Standard Form 85, 

but the Government can't tailor its open -- opening 

security form to people that -- you know, maybe down the 

road at a different NASA laboratory, they do work on 

more sensitive information. It's a standard form. The 

Government has to do things in a standard way.

MR. STORMER: And the Government has a form 

for those people who work in classified information. 

That's SF-85P, SF-85S, and SF-86. The Government can 

standardize, and when it acts as the employer, it has an 

obligation, because it can't take both it's ability and 

authority as the Government and -- and overreach into 

the private lives of its citizens. The questions that 

are being asked here would not be allowed for a private 

employer --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm -- I'm very surprised 

to hear that. I thought that -- that it -- there were 

in -- in the private sector similar questions.

 MR. STORMER: Similar but not questions that 

would go -- you couldn't, as a private employer, say you 

have to turn over your medical records, you have to turn 

over --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where does it say you 

have to turn over your medical records?

 MR. STORMER: That's in SF -- SF-85 page 6, 

which is the release. And all of this has to be 

inquired into --

under the right to privacy.

 MR. STORMER: Most -- general federal law, I 

cannot answer that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's a matter of 

statutory law.

 MR. STORMER: Yes -- well, in some States 

there's a -- where there's a privacy right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Question 42, do you 

have -- pardon me. Question 7 on Form 42, the -- the 

standard one -- do you have any adverse information 

about this person's employment, residence, or activities 

concerning, and so forth -- a violation of the law? Are 

you saying that private employers cannot ask that 

question?

 MR. STORMER: They can't ask the question --

employer?

release which is SF-85 page 6, which requires that you

residential, retail businesses, where you shop, your

not a private employer can ask third persons the 

question that's at Form 42 question 7. I thought your 

representation to me was that private employers cannot 

ask that question.

 MR. STORMER: I -- I -- if I said that, Your 

Honor, I misspoke. The question goes --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But that was enjoined by 

the court below; was it not?

 MR. STORMER: It was.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: All right.

 MR. STORMER: Question 7 talks about 

financial integrity, mental and emotional stability, 

general -- general behavior or conduct, or other 

matters. If a private employer, in many States, goes 

into non-employment-related issues, it's -- it's 

contrary to --

JUSTICE BREYER: What is your view on that 

question? You know, there's a famous, funny example 

that supposedly may be untrue. Senator Hruska used to 

ask and say -- in giving a reference, he would write 

about someone, you'll be lucky if you can get Smith to 

work for you. That's --

(Laughter.)

that you might want to know, and despite the ambiguity

there, and it seemed to me that question 7 sort of drove 

at that. And so -- but they did enjoin it. So, in your 

view, is that aspect of the injunction wrong?

 MR. STORMER: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right, then, if it's 

right, why is it right? Because it seems to me the 

basic thing any employer would want to know is whether 

I'm lucky to get this person to work for me, that kind 

of thing.

 MR. STORMER: Any employer can ask issues 

that are employment-related and based upon the nature of 

the job. You can ask those questions, but any employer 

can't require, as a condition of employment, that you 

sign a release that gives them all manner of information 

as to where you shop, how you shop --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, what is the 

specific thing about question 7 that you think is 

unlawful or should be changed? What words do you object 

to in that question?

 MR. STORMER: Well, other matters, general 

behavior or conduct, certainly.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So they cannot 

ask, do you have any information about this person's 

employment, residence, or activities concerning general 

behavior or conduct or other matters? Now, I am an

employer and I'd like to find out if he's going to do a 

good job. So what am I supposed to say? There doesn't 

seem to be a place here other than that to get into that 

question.

 MR. STORMER: That's because these -- this 

question for the types of situations is not needed. The 

question that is needed is, what are the characteristics 

that you feel he has for this job?

 JUSTICE BREYER: I see. I see.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why do you say a private 

employer could not ask a question of such detail? Why 

could not --

MR. STORMER: Primarily because of the 

release. That's the sixth page of Standard Form 85. 

That release just allows the Government --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why could a private 

employer not -- not do it?

 MR. STORMER: Because, in virtually every 

State, there are laws requiring the disclosure of 

private information --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you mean that 

legislatures take care of these matters? I find it 

curious that in order to establish a Federal 

constitutional right, which turns this area over to this 

Court, you invoke laws that have been democratically

enacted by State legislatures. I mean, if indeed that's 

-- that's the criterion, maybe you don't need us.

 MR. STORMER: I -- the reason I invoke that 

is because the Government has stated that any private 

attorney could ask these questions, and that's a 

misstatement of the law in most States.

 JUSTICE ALITO: May I ask you this question 

about the question on drug treatment? Would it be 

unconstitutional for the Government to take the position 

that to require an employee or applicant for employment 

to disclose whether this individual had violated Federal 

or State drug laws and take the position that if the 

person gave an affirmative answer that was 

disqualifying, would that be unconstitutional?

 MR. STORMER: If they've said I violated 

State or Federal laws, not on its face so long as if it 

said voluntarily you may show mitigation that -- that 

would show that this is not a problem that would make 

you unfit for the job.

 JUSTICE ALITO: So they could -- they could 

say, have you bought, sold, used drugs in violation of 

Federal or State law? If so, you're disqualified, 

unless you can show that you have had treatment. And 

then it's up to you to disclose whether you've had 

treatment.

MR. STORMER: That's correct.

 JUSTICE ALITO: What's really the difference 

between that regime and this -- and what you have here?

 MR. STORMER: The difference is here is 

because it is compelled. It's a compelled disclosure 

and not offering you the opportunity to make a showing. 

And in this concept, the appeal right that you have from 

this is not a robust appeal right that was described. 

It's a very limited appeal that's internal to the 

department, that does not have a right to confront or 

cross-examine --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Can I ask you to clarify 

your understanding of what has been enjoined? We know 

it's easy for Form 85. For Form 42, you mentioned the 

releases. I thought that the Ninth Circuit's order 

covers parts of question 7 and perhaps question 8. I 

didn't see -- is there something, maybe I missed it, 

that says they can ask for release of the records?

 MR. STORMER: There was in the emergency 

order specific reference to the -- to the release. 

There was not in the final order, but the order -- the 

question can't -- has to be read in the context of the 

release, because that's how they get to -- if you go to

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: They said you can't ask 

open-ended questions.

 MR. STORMER: That's correct. They did not 

say that, but it has to be implicit in their ruling 

because in many of the cases --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If somebody is going to 

be enjoined, I mean, it can't be implicit in the ruling 

if you are enjoined. Because it has been stayed, you 

don't have a formal order, but you can't say, well, it's 

implicit in the, how many page, opinion.

 MR. STORMER: The -- well, in the court 

below, for instance, the argument that the Government 

made was that they needed to have the medical records, 

not that they just needed this information, that they 

needed to have the medical records.

 The question that logically flows is, what 

can they do with this information once they learn that 

you had counseling? Then I guess they can ask you who 

the counsellor was, what you told the counsellor, what 

was the purpose of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: As I understand this 

process, this is not an oral interview. It's not -- you

at JPL, civilians who are not employed by NASA. They 

review it; then it goes to NASA and then there's a whole 

series --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes. But is there -- is 

there an oral interview in this process?

 MR. STORMER: There is not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So then they wouldn't 

say -- it says here, so I'm going to ask this, that, and 

the other thing. There's this -- it's a 

written procedure.

 MR. STORMER: I may have misspoken. It 

doesn't preclude an oral interview. I am not aware of 

oral interviews having been made or taken.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: You said there are 22 

people at JPL that are involved in the employment?

 MR. STORMER: There are 22 in the -- the 

Government has approved 22 so-called approvers, who are 

at JPL, who look over -- who are eligible to look over

not. He asks for a, quote, "free-standing right to

the universe; it's certain questions can be asked.

GENERAL KATYAL: And the judgment is based 

on the following rationale -- this is from the Petition 

Appendix at page 18a from the Ninth Circuit. "If the 

Government's actions compel disclosure of private 

information, it has the burden of showing that its use 

of the information would advance a legitimate state 

interest and that its actions are narrowly tailored to 

meet the legitimate interest."

 Now, that reasoning was used to invalidate a 

question, as Justice Kennedy said, on Form 42, that 

employers ask all the time. Banks ask it and the like. 

And it's a -- and it's used to invalidate parts of a 

standard form that the Government uses day in and day 

out and that employers generally use in order to make 

employment decisions.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Are you conceding you 

can't meet that standard, or are you saying that the 

Ninth Circuit misapplied that standard?

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, no, we're not 

conceding that at all. I do think we would meet the 

standard, but our point is it's the same point as in 

Engquist, in the Chief Justices's opinion in Engquist v. 

Oregon, which is forcing the Government to have to march 

into court every time and justify a question here or an 

employee there or soup clerk here or whatever, all of

those different inquiries pose practical burdens on the 

ability of the Government to operate. And so --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you think there's 

something wrong with the Government having to explain 

why it seeks information? I mean, I would think that 

would be fairly simple in virtually every situation.

 GENERAL KATYAL: I think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I ask that question 

because that begs the question of can you ask anything 

you want regardless of why?

 GENERAL KATYAL: I think that political 

process ensures that the Government generally has to ask 

-- has answer that question writ large, but in order for 

the Ninth Circuit's reasoning to apply, it would permit 

any individual person here or there to ask the 

question --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't see how that's so 

because, at least if you're in the Ninth Circuit, you 

know that the Ninth Circuit has blessed all the 

questions on that form but one.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Well, that's only --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, I mean, you could 

raise the question, but you'd be out of court in a 

minute.

 GENERAL KATYAL: Justice Ginsburg, I think

that's only because the challenge -- or the Petitioners 

here only challenge certain questions. Now, I could 

imagine other petitioners challenging other questions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought they did in the 

lower court but abandoned it here, challenge the 

question about the drug use.

 GENERAL KATYAL: The drug use piece, but I 

could imagine all sorts of inquires about other aspects 

of the form. And, indeed, the rationale, the language 

that I just read to you is a road map for anyone to be 

able to come in and say, well, this -- this question 

isn't -- isn't necessary for me because I got a 

background clearance before, I'm rehired, or whatever. 

And it would be a huge practical burden in the same way 

as recognizing the cause of action in Engquist was a 

practical burden. Instead, we think what the Court 

should do here is what it did in Whalen, which is 

recognize governments collect information all the time, 

collect --

JUSTICE ALITO: How much of the information 

that's at issue here can be released and to whom?

 GENERAL KATYAL: The information that can be 

collected that's released here is governed by the 

Privacy Act. And so there are -- the appendix to our 

brief lists out precisely to whom they could be released

to, and that has been around since 1975. We've seen 

virtually no complaints about the Government disclosing 

this type of background information on the SF-85.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that also within the 

Government itself? I know the Privacy Act says the 

Government can't disclose, but how about checks -- I 

mean, we have a vast government -- checks about 

circulating the information within the Government?

 GENERAL KATYAL: If it is for a -- if it is 

to further the Government purpose for which the 

information is collected, it can be distributed to other 

folks in the Government. There are restrictions on 

that, so -- and they're specified in the Privacy Act, 

and they're quite extensive. And to the extent the 

Court is concerned that there is something that isn't 

robust enough in the Privacy Act, we suggest that would 

-- that could wait for an as-applied challenge down the 

road when information is disclosed.

 And we don't think it will, but if, heaven 

forbid, that happens, that's the basis for an as-applied 

challenge down the road. But here what they're asking 

you to do is invalidate questions and forms that the 

Government asks all of its employees and now just wants 

to ask contractors.

 Thank you.
