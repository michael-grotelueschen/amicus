 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 07-615, Ministry of Defense and 

Support For the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of 

Iran versus Elahi.

 Mr. Bederman.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BEDERMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BEDERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, good 

morning and may it please the Court:

 At the heart of this appeal is a matter of 

statutory construction. Respondent received $2.3 

million in public funds under the Victims Protection and 

Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. TRIA provides, and this 

is at the blue brief, page 11a, that a party electing to 

receive such funds must relinquish rights with respect 

to enforcement against property that is at issue in 

claims against the United States before an international 

tribunal or that is the subject of awards by such 

tribunal.

 The property in question here is the Cubic 

judgment. Respondent renounced rights to attach the 

Cubic judgment because in case B/61 before the 

Iran-United States Claims Tribunal at the Hague the

United States has demanded that any awards Iran receives 

in its claim against the United States be set off by the 

amount of the Cubic judgment. This can only occur if 

the Cubic judgment is released from Respondent's lien 

and is remitted to Iran's Ministry of Defense.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they could 

have agreed that they have a bank account somewhere and 

any amounts would be set off by that. That wouldn't 

make that bank account at issue with respect to their 

claim.

 MR. BEDERMAN: No, in that scenario I agree 

with you, Mr. Chief Justice, that that would not be 

implicated, because I think the clear import of the 

statutory language here that Congress is trying to 

achieve is that being at issue -- as you'll notice, the 

statutory provision in 201(c) is disjunctive. It refers 

to claims against the United States -- at issue in 

claims against the United States before an international 

tribunal, or that is the subject of an award. So I 

think the disjunctive character of the statute might 

indicate that the at-issue prong includes a broader set 

of property than would be indicated possibly by the 

"subject of an award."

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it doesn't matter 

that Iran recognizes that this would be used to set off

a judgment it might obtain, because you just said, well 

they could -- a bank account could be used to set it off 

and that's not sufficient.

 MR. BEDERMAN: Well, the mutual -- let me be 

clear. The mutual position of Iran and the United 

States before the Claims Tribunal is that the Cubic 

judgment, because it's related to a claim within the 

tribunal's jurisdiction -- and I think that's a key 

limiting principle here. The United States would not be 

entitled to set off amounts in bank accounts that are 

attributable to other parties or other aspects that are 

not implicated in claims or defenses before the 

tribunal.

 So clearly an examination of the tribunal's 

jurisdiction and the relevant claims or defenses that 

are before the tribunal is relevant here. Petitioner is 

not espousing a position before this Court that any 

inchoate property located anywhere in the world would be 

blanketed with immunity under this provision. It's not 

necessary to reach that conclusion in order to find for 

Petitioner here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The United States at some 

stage told the tribunal in The Hague that the Cubic 

judgment -- and now I'm quoting -- "has nothing to do 

with matters before the international tribunal."

"Nothing to do with."

 MR. BEDERMAN: Yes, that is the language 

used by the United States in a memorial before the 

tribunal. The United States has also indicated, and 

this is clear in the gray brief at pages 81 in note 32 

and the gray brief at pages 83 to 85, and in the 

lodgment, that if -- if Iran receives an award in case 

B/61 it must be offset or set off, or "recouped" is 

sometimes the language used in the correspondence 

between the two governments before the tribunal, by the 

amount of the Cubic judgment.

 I won't speak for the United States position 

before the tribunal. The United States is here to do 

that, of course, Justice Ginsburg. But the only way I 

can interpret that remark is to indicate that obviously 

before the tribunal is the issue of the United States' 

obligations to Iran under the Algiers Accords. The 

Cubic judgment deals, of course, with the private 

disposition of the contractual relationship between 

Iran's Ministry of Defense and the Cubic military 

contractor.

 Now Respondents take the position that these 

two make the matters unrelated. But if you review 

carefully the tribunal's jurisdiction as encompassing 

both claims and counterclaims, and according to the

Algiers Accords in the claims settlement declaration, 

counterclaims include that which arises out of the same 

contract, transaction or occurrence that constitutes the 

subject matter of the claim.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is no counterclaim 

stated before the tribunal as of this moment.

 MR. BEDERMAN: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the 

first.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is no counterclaim 

in the case before the tribunal.

 MR. BEDERMAN: That's right. The United 

States did not file a formal counterclaim in case B/61, 

but it has made a demand for a setoff. And within the 

tribunal rules, a setoff can be the subject of notice 

under Rule 19-3 or an amendment or certainly comes under 

waiver of objection provision in Rule 30.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I was going to ask that 

question. In other words, there are cases or at least 

it is contemplated that there will be cases under the 

rules, where the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal does 

determine that there should or should not be an offset.

 MR. BEDERMAN: There -- there certainly have 

been cases, if you are speaking of the tribunal's 

earlier jurisprudence in terms of offsetting claims.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

MR. BEDERMAN: Yes, there has certainly been 

ample tribunal precedent which the United States has 

relied upon in making this demand for a setoff.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But assuming -- assuming 

the tribunal takes up some such issue as Justice Kennedy 

has mentioned, it will start with the assumption that 

the Cubic judgment is in fact a valid judgment. It will 

not look behind the Cubic judgment as such, will it?

 MR. BEDERMAN: Of course, the validity of 

the Cubic judgment does remain on appeal when the Ninth 

Circuit --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that's an entirely 

separate proceeding. Assuming the Cubic judgment has 

not been reversed through the appellate process that it 

is going through, then the tribunal will take the Cubic 

judgment as it finds it.

 MR. BEDERMAN: I would assume it would. And 

I assume --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Doesn't it make it 

pretty tough to say that the Cubic judgment is at issue?

 MR. BEDERMAN: No, Justice Souter. If -- if 

we understand Congress' -- I don't -- I think this 

matter can be resolved by a straightforward textual 

approach in looking at TRIA section 201(c). Evidently, 

though, if we are looking at congressional intent here,

it is to protect the United States' litigation position 

before the tribunal. To allow the attachment of the 

Cubic judgment would simply be allowing Respondent to 

remove a source of money that would be available --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I mean, I think we 

understand that. And -- and it's clear that the United 

States, in effect, is taking the position that that's 

all we need to bear in mind. But it suggests to me that 

the drafting of the statute did not go as far as it 

might have gone to protect the interests of the United 

States.

 MR. BEDERMAN: I won't speak, of course, for 

the United States' position. The Petitioner's position 

is that where property has been identified to the 

tribunal as being related to a claim or defense within 

its jurisdiction, and the availability of that property 

affects the relief that can be granted by the tribunal, 

it is at issue.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Explain to me why it 

would effect the relief? Because suppose Iran doesn't 

get the proceeds of the Cubic judgment, but instead a 

creditor of Iran, in this case Elahi, a creditor gets 

it. It should still be -- you've paid the -- Iran's 

bill. Iran owes money to X. Why shouldn't the United 

States equally get the credit whether the Cubic judgment

in the end is pocketed by Iran or by Iran's creditor, 

Elahi?

 MR. BEDERMAN: Well, obviously we await the 

tribunal's award in this respect. And I believe, based 

on the tribunal's past precedents, the benefit in terms 

of finding a breach of the Algiers Accords as it would 

or it must in this case to find in favor of Iran, would 

indicate that the benefits accruing for certain setoffs 

must ultimately come back to Iran in order to be 

credited in the way that you suggest.

 I think it is an improper position to 

suggest that if a creditor of Iran or Iran's Ministry of 

Defense in this instance can claim or assert the lien so 

that somehow it's credited to Iran's account, so to 

speak, in calculating the setoff of the tribunal. That 

has not been the tribunal's jurisprudence in terms of 

examining the implications of a breach by the United 

States under the Algiers Accords. And in a number of 

cases --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would you -- something 

that I would just like clarification on. You mentioned 

that the Cubic judgment is on appeal to the Ninth 

Circuit. It has been on appeal since June of '98?

 MR. BEDERMAN: Yes, ma'am.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And there are cross

appeals. What are the positions taken about that 

judgment by the respective sides, and why is it pending 

for ten years?

 MR. BEDERMAN: That has been a mystery to me 

as well. In fact, there has been a resolution by Cubic 

Defense Systems and Iran's Ministry of Defense and as 

soon as the Court renders its judgment in this case, 

that matter will finally move to disposition. It is a 

bit odd that the underlying issue of Cubic's objections 

to the district court's enforcement of the International 

Chamber of Commerce or ICC arbitral award has pended for 

so long. I would have thought, logically, it would have 

made more sense to have disposed of those issues and 

then allow the disposition of the liens to be resolved 

by the Court.

 Essentially, it is Cubic's appeal 

challenging aspects of the district court's enforcement 

under the New York convention of the ICC arbitral award. 

I think to the extent that there is a counterclaim it's 

simply that there were some bases for support of the 

judgment which Iran's Ministry of Defense would have put 

forward in addition to the district court. That's what 

I understand in terms of the ruling of Judge Brewster 

originally in the district court on this manner.

 So, yes, it is unfortunate that the

underlying validity of the Cubic judgment still remains 

open as a matter of appeal.

 But again to return to your point, 

Justice Ginsburg, in Cases 815 and 821 before the 

tribunal this question of what would be the 

implications, financial and otherwise, for the United 

States being found by the tribunal to be in breach of 

the Algiers Accords because of the failure of not 

allowing the export of Iranian property or repatriation 

of Iranian property to the United States has been 

explicated. And, in fact, in already one instance the 

tribunal has found the United States to be in breach of 

Algiers Accords obligations.

 So again, I can't speak for what a ruling in 

the tribunal would be. All I can suggest is certainly 

the Iranian position before the tribunal would be that 

in the instance that if Mr. Elahi or any other lienor 

were successful in attaching the Cubic judgment that in 

such a situation it should not be credited as a setoff 

under these circumstances.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could -- let's assume 

that the -- that Iran is able to execute on the Cubic 

judgment. Could it take the proceeds out of the United 

States, given the 2007 blocking order?

 MR. BEDERMAN: Well, I mean, the issue of

the secretary of state's October 2007 designation, which 

I think is what you are referring to, is a late 

development in this case. Of course, that occurred 

three months after the Ninth Circuit's amended opinion.

 My submission to this Court is that the 

appropriate disposition, assuming the Court well takes 

Petitioner's position that Respondent has actually 

relinquished its claim under TRIA, is to remand back to 

the district court, because then we would have two new 

sets of lienors, Mr. Raffi and Mr. Rubin. It would be 

before the district court that factual issues like 

whether the designation of the "Ministry of Defense and 

Armed Forces Logistics," which is what is actually named 

in the blocking order, actually covers the Ministry of 

Defense and Support for the Armed Forces of the Islamic 

Republic of Iran, who is your Petitioner today.

 The issue of whether designations cover 

particular entities or aliases of entities is an 

intensity factual one; the D.C. Circuit in the National 

Council of Resistance case, Chief Justice Roberts, an 

opinion you are well aware of at the D.C. Circuit. 

These are intensely factual inquiries about whether 

aliases of particular organizations are covered by 

designations.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You mentioned -- you

mentioned that there were other claimants or others --

others who would like to execute --

MR. BEDERMAN: Other lienors.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- other lienors -- other 

attachments. And so, you said in the end -- well --

well, what would be the effect of those other liens?

 MR. BEDERMAN: My understanding, 

Justice Ginsburg, is in both the cases of Mr. Rubin and 

Mr. Raffi, as far as I am aware, they have not made the 

relinquishment election under TRIA as Dr. Elahi has done 

here. And because they have not made the relinquishment 

proviso, they would not be subject to the at-issue 

question that is now before the Court.

 Iran's Ministry of Defense has other 

substantive defenses against their liens, which we 

appropriately presented before the district court.

 The only submission I am making to this 

Court at this time is that it is not necessary for this 

Court exercising plenary authority to decide whether 

it's a blocked asset. That is appropriate for remand 

because, notwithstanding the U.S. position, I think 

there are questions of whether your Petitioner is a 

covered entity under the -- under the designation, and 

whether in fact it is the beneficial owner, whether 

Iran's Air Force is the beneficial owner of this claim.

And there are other substantive defenses that claim 

retroactivity, as well. So, again, I just don't think 

it's appropriate --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But going back to the main 

issue, the only reason that this is at issue before the 

Iran tribunal is because it might be a setoff in the 

event of judgment in favor of Iran?

 MR. BEDERMAN: Yes. Whether it is available 

for setoff. And again, I want to be clear that --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's the -- that's 

the only basis for your argument? I thought it was a 

broader suggestion that these are, to some extent, 

substitute assets for the assets that are at issue?

 MR. BEDERMAN: Well, I mean, that may be one 

useful analytic in thinking about this. I was trying in 

imagining the interest of the Court in understanding the 

tribunal's jurisdiction under the Algiers Accords and 

what the tribunal has already ruled, and that's why I 

think respectful consideration might be appropriate 

here, inasmuch as the tribunal, in interpreting its 

jurisdiction under the Algiers Accords, which is 

essentially its organic instrument, has made a 

determination in Case B/66 that the substantive 

contracts at issue here between Cubic and the Iranian 

Air Force are at issue in case B/61.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Can you -- can you 

articulate a general test in a sentence or two about how 

you decide whether particular assets are at issue?

 MR. BEDERMAN: Yes. I will repeat the one I 

-- I rendered before because I think it is the most 

useful analytic, and I -- I take no credit. This is 

essentially Judge Fisher's analysis in the dissent 

below. As he indicated, that -- that -- where property 

has been identified to the Tribunal -- and certainly the 

Cubic judgment and the proceedings that have occurred in 

the Federal district court in -- in Southern California 

and now the Ninth Circuit and now here have been 

identified to the Tribunal in mutual representations and 

undertakings by the parties. Where this property has 

been identified to the Tribunal as being related to a 

claim or defense within the Tribunal's jurisdiction --

and I think that is the key limiting principle here. 

That's -- there is a criticism that an expansive reading 

of TRIA's "At Issue" provision will allow Iran and the 

United States, as unlikely as it sounds, to mutually 

collude to cover various properties and assets around 

the world, I think noting that the -- that the Cubic 

judgment is within the Court's jurisdiction as 

understood under the Algiers Accords Claims Settlement 

Declaration, Article 2, paragraph 3.

And then the second prong is that the 

availability of that property affects the relief that 

can be granted by the Tribunal. And, again, we are not 

hypothesizing here. The Tribunal has already indicated 

in cases like Owens Corning, Futura Trading and Computer 

Services, that when you have a situation avoiding a 

double recovery, that a setoff derived from collateral 

proceedings, even absent privity of contract with the 

sovereign seeking adjustment and with respect to 

different causes of action, a setoff is still 

appropriate within the Tribunal.

 So it's both an avoidance of a -- of a 

double-recovery rule and also a notion that a -- a 

certain offset is -- is related as within the -- the 

jurisdiction of the tribunal as arising again from the 

same contract transaction or occurrence.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: "At Issue" means related to 

-- "At Issue" means related to an issue in a separate 

case.

 MR. BEDERMAN: I mean --

JUSTICE SOUTER: That's what it boils down 

to, doesn't it?

 MR. BEDERMAN: Petitioner is not taking the 

same --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, doesn't it?

MR. BEDERMAN: No, Your Honor. I'm sorry. 

The Petitioner's position is slightly more modulated 

than the United States. The United States' position 

here is all it has to be is relevant. I -- I will leave 

it to the Court to -- to speak with the United States 

about that in a moment.

 I think a more nuanced understanding of the 

Tribunal's jurisdiction is appropriate here. Is -- and 

here there is no question, based on the materials that 

you have not only in the joint appendix but also in the 

lodgment, that the Cubic contracts have been identified 

to the Tribunal. And now the Cubic judgment as an 

offset has a setoff -- or "recoupment" is sometimes the 

language used in the diplomatic exchanges and filings 

before the Tribunal -- has now been identified to the 

Tribunal.

are two other individuals who have attached this 

judgment?

 MR. BEDERMAN: Yes, Justice Breyer. I think 

I spoke about that a moment ago. That would be --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. And is it the 

case that Iran's position in respect to those 

attachments is that those attachments, insofar as they 

are valid and executed, require a setoff from whatever

 MR. BEDERMAN: My understanding, if you are 

speaking of me characterizing the United States' 

position --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. I'm saying I take 

it from something I have read in this that Iran believes 

that if, in fact, it won a judgment and that judgment is 

from someone like Cubic --

MR. BEDERMAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- who they thought was 

prevented from delivering planes because of the embargo 

-- so it was relevant -- that that judgment, which they 

get if they collect on it, should be deducted from other 

money the United States owes them.

 MR. BEDERMAN: Yes, and --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- unless instead of them 

getting it, the attacher gets it.

 MR. BEDERMAN: It's the --

JUSTICE BREYER: The attachee gets it.

 MR. BEDERMAN: It's the "unless," I suppose, 

that, of course, Iran objects to. It is that in order 

for the setoff to be effective within the Tribunal's 

jurisprudence and jurisdiction, Iran's Ministry of 

Defense or -- or the --

the attaching person. That's my point.

 MR. BEDERMAN: Yes, sir.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And so that is at issue 

before the -- and -- and it is at issue in those cases. 

If the person who attaches it gets the money rather than 

Iran, Iran will say: We do not have to have a setoff.

MR. BEDERMAN: Correct. If it's at --

queue of individuals who have lined up to -- to --

same as its position vis-a-vis the other two attachments 

on the Elahi judgment.

the money, you can subtract it from other money the 

United States owes them. But if the attaching people 

end up with the money, you cannot.

 MR. BEDERMAN: So it's "At Issue" -- I am --

I am sorry for having been so opague.  It is "At Issue" 

in the sense of "joinder at issue," a legitimate 

disagreement between the parties. And its also "At 

Issue," I believe -- I think in the sense that Congress 

intended by this provision of saying that the funds are 

available for a tribunal ruling. And, therefore, to 

allow an attachment under these circumstances would 

frustrate the United States' litigation position. So 

any way you parse what "At Issue" means --

JUSTICE BREYER: You would take the same 

position if, in fact, this money which is owed to Iran 

by -- by Cubic -- that is, Cubic, which then Iran got a 

judgment on -- instead of a judgment in favor of Iran, 

Cubic had written them a check, and they had taken the 

check and bought a house in Manhattan, or they had put 

it in an Iranian bank account, and either Mr. Elahi or 

one of the other two people sought to attach the bank 

account or the house or the grocery store, which they 

might have also have used. Am I right --

MR. BEDERMAN: Yes.

concern, that the more attenuated you get, can you 

attribute a particular property, whether it's a bank 

account or a -- or a New York condo --

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't see why either is 

the slightest a bit more attenuated. In either case 

they are owned by the Ministry of Defense of Iran.

 MR. BEDERMAN: I would certainly concur; 

and, if I may, I will reserve the balance of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The United States does not appear here today 

in support of Iran, but, rather, in defense of critical 

interests of the United States before the United States-

Iran Claims Tribunal. In particular, the holding of the 

Court of Appeals that the United States never unblocked 

Iranian military assets after the Algiers accords is 

directly contrary to the position of the United States

before the Tribunal, and Iran immediately indicated that 

it would use that holding against the United States and 

in support of its multimillion-dollar --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's not saying 

that. Isn't that -- that issue is moot?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, 

there is now a new and independent reason why the asset 

is blocked. And, in fact, Respondent no longer defends 

the holding of the court of appeals on that basis.

 It is, we wish to emphasize, essential that 

this Court vacate that holding and indicate that it is 

no longer legally valid so that it is not -- that 

erroneous holding is not used against us in support of 

Iran's two-million-dollar claim.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if we -- if we took 

the position that you are expressing about what is at 

issue, we would never reach the second question.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, we -- we 

think that the Court would not. It would vacate the 

decision of the Court of Appeals. It would be helpful 

certainly to the United States if the Court emphasized 

the natural fact that that would mean that the court of 

appeals' erroneous holding was not any longer legally --

tribunals. If a -- if a judgment is moot, it's moot. 

We are not going to go back and tell the Ninth Circuit 

to revise its opinion just because that's helpful to 

you.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: No. The -- the 

Court would vacate the decision, certainly.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is it your 

position that that -- that is moot?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: It is our position 

that the -- because Respondent has relinquished his 

right to attach these assets, the decision of the court 

of appeals should be vacated. And that would have the 

affect of rendering inoperative that erroneous -- the 

other erroneous holding of the court of appeals with 

respect to blocked assets.

 It is the position of the United States --

and we agree with Respondent on this point -- that as of 

now, because of the October, 2007, designation, the 

property of Petitioner is blocked and subject to 

attachment under TRIA. And I don't believe there is any 

need for further proceedings on that.

 The Secretary of State designated the 

Ministry of Defense of Iran, and the position of 

Petitioner in the court of appeals on remand from this 

Court was that it is the Ministry of Defense of Iran, a

central core constituent part of the Iranian state, that 

is the entity that was designated.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do I understand correctly 

that that means that because it's a blocked asset, then 

Dr. Elahi can get it, but Iran itself couldn't get it?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Elahi, Respondent 

Elahi, could get it if he had not relinquished his 

rights to attach --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- assets at issue 

before the tribunal. As of right now, the asset is 

blocked and Iran could not repatriate it, as of right 

now. Of course, blocking orders can be amended, but as 

of right now it is frozen and Petitioner cannot 

repatriate it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So why isn't the 

consequence that you are so worried about under the 

Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act that 

this is going to hurt your position by the tribunal, the 

same consequence that is going to come from the fact 

that these assets are blocked?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, 

again, the blocking order is the present status of the 

assets. It doesn't mean that they could not later be 

repatriated to Petitioner; whereas, execution by

Respondent against the assets would mean that they would 

be forever denied to Petitioner.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So why wouldn't the 

United States get credit for that, too, on the theory 

that I suggested before?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, you are 

right, Your Honor, that is the position of the United 

States. And earlier Your Honor quoted language from the 

oral argument of the United States that the -- or maybe 

it was one of our briefs -- that the Cubic judgment 

is -- that the tribunal doesn't have to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It has nothing to do with 

matters before the --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: That is in the 

context of our saying that, whether or not -- in the 

view of the United States, whether or not Petitioner 

ever collects that money, the United States is entitled 

to an offset, and in fact, we believe it's a complete 

defense to Iran's claim.

 Of course, Petitioner's argument -- or 

Iran's argument before the tribunal is that it is --

that the United States is entitled to a reduction of 

liability only if Iran actual receives the assets. And 

that's why the language of the statute is written more

broadly when the litigation before the tribunal is 

ongoing. At that point any property that is at issue 

before the tribunal is not subject to attachment by one 

who has relinquished, and that's because this Court nor 

any other lower court in the United States is supposed 

to pre-judge the merits of those respective positions. 

Iran's position -- and it's on page 85a of the United 

States' appendix -- is that the awarded amount, unless 

received by Iran, cannot be offset against any relief 

which the United States may be found to owe Iran.

 So that is Iran's position. That is at 

issue before the tribunal.

 The Respondent would have the Court believe 

that the proceedings in the tribunal are in the nature 

of an in rem proceeding, that it's a property dispute. 

They use that term repeatedly in the brief, "a property 

dispute." But that is not the nature of the proceedings 

in the tribunal. Iran has asserted a claim that the 

United States violated its obligations under the Algiers 

Accords. The remedy it seeks is , and I quote -- this 

is from -- excuse me -- from the -- let's see -- the 

remedy they seek -- they seek is the value of the Cubic 

sale to Canada. They have said that in the state -- in 

Iran's reply in statement -- claim 16 that Respondent 

relies upon, they say that the remedy they seek is not

the asset itself.

 Of course, the asset had been dissipated 

before Iran ever filed a statement of claim against the 

United States. The remedy is the proceeds of that sale 

to Canada. The proceeds of the sale to Canada, which 

are the subject of Iran's claim against the United 

States in the tribunal, have been reduced to judgment in 

the Cubic judgment. That --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess this may be 

the same question Justice Breyer asked. I mean, where 

do you cut this off? You've got the proceeds from the 

sale to Canada that presumably go to Cubic, and then 

Cubic, you know, builds a new facility somewhere with 

those proceeds and then sells it to somebody else. I 

mean, are those still assets at issue in the claims 

before the tribunal?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I believe 

that in fact the language of the statute makes it -- the 

assertions of the parties before the tribunal that 

define the property that is at issue before the 

tribunal. That, again, is so that the courts are not 

put in a position of adjudicating, prejudging, the 

merits of the parties' arguments before the tribunal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, that's kind of 

a -- that's a broad assertion. In other words, so long

as you and Iran get together and say this asset is at 

issue in a situation where whether it's at issue or not 

saves you money and gives money to Iran, that seems to 

be a very self-serving legal test.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, Your Honor, I 

don't believe that this Court needs to consider what the 

outer reaches are. In this case, this is -- Iran 

characterizes it, and this is at page, again, at page 85 

of the U.S. appendix, that the Cubic judgment, quote 

"constitutes an integral part of the remedy sought in 

case B/61."

 This isn't an offset or a counterclaim. 

Justice Ginsburg, you previously alluded to the fact the 

United States did not file a counterclaim. And that's 

because this is not some unrelated counterclaim the 

United States has against Iran. This is a critical part 

of Iran's claim against the United States. It defeats, 

in the view of the United States, Iran's claim entirely. 

At the very least, it reduces the amount of Iran's claim 

against the United States.

 This isn't somehow unrelated; we're 

asserting, well, we can use this as an offset because 

you also owe us money from something else. This is in 

Iran's own statement, and this is the statement that you

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But how is that affected 

-- how is that affected depending on whether or not the 

judgment is executed or not. Would the Iran tribunal 

have the authority to order Cubic not to satisfy the 

judgment, but to just hold the funds?

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: I -- I don't know. 

Cubic is not before the tribunal. But what we can ask 

is, can we conceive of -- and I think it's relatively 

easy to conceive of -- an award of the tribunal that 

says, the United States owes Iran $2.8 million; if the 

Cubic judgment is received by Iran, the United States 

owes Iran nothing. And clearly, in that circumstance, 

the Cubic judgment is the subject of the award of the 

tribunal.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't know that it's the 

subject of the award. And it's really not at issue; 

it's just recognizing that there has been some prior 

transaction.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: Well, I guess, Your 

Honor, you have to think what does it mean for any 

property -- property to be at issue before the tribunal 

or the subject of the award?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: It means that at the end of 

the proceeding one side or the other gets the property.

JUSTICE SOUTER: And that is not going to be 

the -- what one side or the other gets in this 

proceeding is going to be a new judgment. And that new 

judgment may or may not be satisfied by dealing with the 

prior judgment. But that doesn't mean that the prior 

judgment is at issue; it simply means that the prior 

judgment may be used to discharge in an appropriate case 

an obligation which is determined in the later 

proceeding.

 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: If I may respond. 

Your Honor, on that view, even the ACMR is not at issue 

before the tribunal, because the tribunal cannot order 

the United States to hand over the ACMR to Iran. In the 

A/15 judgment to which Petitioner's counsel alluded 

earlier, the tribunal recognized that it is not a 

violation of the United States' obligations under the 

Algiers Accords not to issue an export license. 

Therefore, Iran --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. So Iran --

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER: -- is not entitled 

to the ACMR. It's entitled to its loss, and its loss 

has been reduced to judgment in the Cubic judgment.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. PHILLIPS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 I think the previous 25 or so minutes has 

demonstrated one sort of overarching fact, which is that 

there is an enormous risk, if this Court decides to 

interpret the language of this statute broadly, that it 

will easily sweep beyond any kind of arrangements 

between Iran and the United States in ways that 

fundamentally, obviously, disadvantage the very people 

that Congress clearly intended to benefit by this entire 

statutory scheme.

 This is a scheme that was designed to 

provide remedies, recoveries, to the victims of 

terrorism. And somehow in the scheme of everything that 

was discussed in the first 25 or so minutes of this 

argument, the victims of terrorism are completely 

shunted aside on basic -- on the basis of very technical 

ways of reading it.

 But if we go back to the language of the 

statute, which is in the Petitioner's brief at 11a, it 

talks about "enforcement against property that is at 

issue in claims against the United States." So the

notion that we would focus on the word "property," as it 

relates to the tribunal and that the tribunal has in 

front of it, is a natural consequence of the language of 

that provision. And to me, at least, the best way to 

look at the logic is to review how often the United 

States has described and Iran has described what was the 

property at issue before the claims tribunal and the 

B/61 proceeding? And this is at 65a of the joint -- of 

the government's brief: "The property at issue consists 

of one air combat maneuvering range system and all 

necessary subparts." There is no dispute that the 

property was within the jurisdiction of the United 

States. Now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So that if you had 

these military assets, which are clearly the assets that 

are at issue in Iran's claim --

MR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Cubic is worried 

about what to do with it and so they sell them to the 

Canadians but they keep the proceeds in escrow, under 

the theory that look we may end up owing this to the 

Iranians under the tribunal. Under the setoff, this may 

not be our assets, which -- I mean the Iranians have a 

claim to these. Would those -- would those escrow funds 

be assets at issue?

MR. PHILLIPS: I think they would be because 

of the way the Iranians actually pled this. They said 

give us either back -- give us either the military 

equipment that we bought, or give us the economic value 

of that. But that's -- and that's why --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why is that 

very different from this situation, where you have an 

arbitration award saying that you, Cubic, owe the 

equivalent of what you should have -- what you would 

have provided to Iran, if there hadn't been the 

revolution?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, there are two answers 

to that. The first one is remember precisely what the 

arbitration award is. The arbitration award is not the 

value of the asset. That was asked for; that was 

rejected by the arbitrator. The arbitration award is 

for the value of a separate contract between Cubic and 

the Canadian government. You will recall in the award, 

specifically the arbitrator said with respect to the 

underlying ACMR contract with Iran, that was mutually 

walked away from by both parties, and then there was a 

separate agreement that was entered into between the 

parties, and that was the basis for the arbitration 

award saying the value of breach of that secondary 

agreement is the part that serves as the arbitral award.

That it seems to me ought to be regarded at a minimum as 

one step too far removed, because that's not the 

property that is at issue before the claims tribunal in 

any way that the parties are disputing about it. They 

accept that number. And then --

JUSTICE BREYER: Right. So what is the --

it seems at the moment, frankly you could read it either 

way. Let's imagine that -- that Cubic sold some jets 

that we blocked and they get some money, and they did it 

under their contract, and they got 2 million dollars. 

And suppose they said, we owe Iran this money, and they 

pay Iran the money, and Iran puts it in a bank account 

or buys the grocery store. All right?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now suppose that happened. 

It makes it simpler. And then what happens is three 

people, including Mr. Elahi and two others who don't 

accept money, the other two, attach it, on the ground 

Iran owes us this money.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: We want the grocery store. 

And suppose, further, Iran then says, if they get their 

money, you cannot subtract it, United States, from what 

you owe us. But if we get the money, then you can 

subtract it. That's their view.

The United States' view is different. Who 

will resolve that question? The tribunal. So they say, 

what is at issue is not who owns the grocery store; what 

is at issue is the question of whether we get the money 

or you get the money. What money? The money that is 

the value of the grocery store, or the bank account, in 

which case it's identical.

 Now I think in that situation it's easy for 

me to say that money, the grocery store, or the bank 

account, of course is at issue before the tribunal. For 

the question is, does Iran get it or does the United 

States get it, in the situation where the two other 

people -- leaving Elahi out of it -- can attach it. I 

can easily read it that way. I can also read it the way 

you want.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right? So now, which 

do I do?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, you clearly -- and I 

agree with you; there is no question you can read this 

statute either way.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. I'll then add 

that the strongest argument against you, it seems to me, 

is the whole point of this was not simply to compensate

victims of terrorism. That's a worthy goal, and that's 

one of the points. But it was to compensate them 

consistent with the proper running, in the interests of 

the United States, of the Iranian-American Claims 

Tribunal.

 And so this is just the kind of issue we 

don't want to simply take away and let the victim have, 

because there is a strong risk the tribunal will rule 

against us, and we will have to pay it twice. Okay. 

That's the argument against you.

 Now, what's the argument for you?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. First of all --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

 MR. PHILLIPS: A significant purpose of this 

entire exercise obviously is to provide redress to the 

victims of terrorism.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's one, but --

MR. PHILLIPS: 201(d) is a specific 

statutory construction provision which seems to suggest 

that Congress says that if there are doubts about how to 

apply this particular provision, you ought to put the 

thumb on the scale in favor of the victim. So you do --

you will give meaning to section 201(c)(4) of the TRIA 

if you adopt a position consistent with our position.

 The reality is that given that there are two

more lienholders in line, none of this has anything to 

do with Iran and with the way the tribunal is going to 

proceed, because even if you were to say that Dr. Elahi 

is not entitled to this, there is no relinquishment 

claim with respect to the others, so this money is never 

going back to Iran, under any set of circumstances.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That creates the issue, 

because the question is whether money that never goes 

back to Iran, but rather goes to an attaching person, is 

money that is or money that is not subtracted from the 

amount that the United States owes Iran.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But -- but --

JUSTICE BREYER: And that question is the 

question --

MR. PHILLIPS: But Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- is the question that is 

before the commission.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But the problem with this, 

Justice Breyer, is that this is a relinquishment 

provision. It -- it is saying to us in return for these 

limited resources, 20 percent of the judgment -- and 

that is only 20 percent of the compensatory judgment and 

completely lose the punitive judgment -- in return for 

that you have to relinquish certain rights; and it seems 

to me that Congress would not have adopted the a

provision that said and the rights you relinquish are 

essentially unknowable under any circumstances and 

extend to the ends of the earth. What I --

JUSTICE BREYER: They are totally knowable. 

They are totally knowable. In order to decide what they 

are all you have to do is to look at the issues before 

the commission and decide whether those issues concern 

specific, concrete property; that is, the property that 

you have an interest in.

 With my grocery store, with my bank account, 

and with this claim, it is absolutely specific, and Iran 

has put before the commission the question of whether if 

you pay the money to an attaching person, we don't get 

it, or we do get it.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I gather. Now 

you can tell me I'm wrong on that if you want.

 MR. PHILLIPS: The parties have been very 

specific about it, and we cited in a series of 

quotations about what is the property at issue here; and 

the property at issue, Justice Breyer is the ACMR system 

or the economic value of the ACMR system. What is not 

at issue in this case is the value of the Cubic 

judgment. First of all, there was an effort to bring 

the Cubic judgment specifically before the tribunal, and

it was rejected as having no jurisdiction, certainly no 

jurisdiction over Cubic and then no jurisdiction over 

the United States' part of the Cubic judgment because 

that was not a contract between --

JUSTICE BREYER: They are trying to attach 

the ACMR system.

 MR. PHILLIPS: They did --

JUSTICE BREYER: They are trying to attach 

the Cubic judgment. The ACMR judgment is in Canada.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But that's the whole point of 

this. The property at issue before the tribunal is the 

ACMR system, and indeed in 1981 when this was originally 

brought what Iran wanted was the ACMR system.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And that's one piece of 

property. The other piece of property that is at issue 

is the judgment, and the way it's at issue is I take it 

that two other people are saying, we attach it; Iran 

says because they attach it, you don't subtract it from 

the ACMR judgment; and we are saying, even though they 

attach it, you subtract it, and therefore it's before 

the tribunal as well.

 That's my understanding at the moment, and 

I'm asking you to explain why that's wrong.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer, there is no 

question that the fact that there are subsequent

lienholders in line affects the possibility, but I would 

have thought it would only affect it in a way that is 

positive for me. Because Iran is saying, look, this 

doesn't have any relevance to the -- to the Iran 

tribunal if we don't ever get the money; and the reality 

is whether Dr. Elahi gets the money or the other 

lienholders get the money, Iran is never going to get 

the money, which says to me it's not at issue under any 

theory of the case in front of the U.S.-Iranian claims 

tribunal.

 And so that would be my quickest answer to 

that; to the extent that you have other lienholders, it 

simply means that there really is nothing at issue 

there. But it still seems to me that the better way --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why not? I mean, the 

question I raised before, why wouldn't the United States 

be urging that it gets credit, whether Iran gets the 

money or whether the people who are creditors of Iran 

get the money. In either case, the United States should 

be able to have --

MR. PHILLIPS: Right, the United States 

would still have that -- would still have that argument, 

but it's not a claim against the United States, which is 

what's required under the statute that we are dealing 

with here when it's viewed that way.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But Iran might say in the 

tribunal, in responding to the setoff argument, this 

claim that we brought against you, the United States, 

implicates a breach of obligations that you have that 

are un -- somewhat unrelated to what was at issue in 

the -- in the -- in the Cubic judgment. And then the 

United States would say, no, that's not true. So they 

would have to examine the Cubic judgment. So that means 

it's at issue before the court.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I don't think there is 

anybody whose going to -- well, maybe there is some 

sense in which examining the Cubic judgment, but I don't 

think the tribunal has remotely been asked to or will 

under any circumstances be asked to review the Cubic 

judgment.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: There might be in the 

setoff proceedings. There might -- there might be an 

argument that there are two obligations, and there is a 

setoff or that there is a setoff.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I mean, I think there 

is no question these are for two different obligations. 

And I think that's why candidly the Court ought to 

decide that this is not property at issue here, because 

it is so clearly unrelated to the weapons system itself 

or to any monetization of the weapons system. Remember

the Cubic judgment comes from an arbitral award that 

doesn't have anything to do with that arms sale. It has 

to do with a completely separate contractual undertaking 

between the Cubic and the Canadian government --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think we might get 

MR. PHILLIPS: -- and Iran.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- substantial -- a 

substantial degree of argument on that point.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know how there could 

be an argument on that point, Justice Kennedy. If you 

read the opinion of the arbitrator, it is absolutely 

clear that the -- that the underlying agreement between 

Iran and Cubic with respect to the arms sale was 

mutually terminated by the parties, and a new agreement 

entered into in order to resell those properties to 

Canada. The opinion is crystalline in that regard.

 And it was on the basis of the violation of 

that separate agreement that the -- that Cubic was then 

held to be liable to Iran for the $2.8 million.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The agreement 

between who -- between who --

MR. PHILLIPS: Between Iran and Cubic.

the place of what was at dispute. Which is what they 

owed us because they didn't ship us the arms that we 

paid for. I don't see that that adds anything to your 

argument.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it just says that you 

move even further down the road from what are the 

properties that are, in fact, at issue before the 

tribunal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Right, so Iran says, 

look, you are not going to ship us the planes, whatever 

it is, you are not --

MR. PHILLIPS: Although they wanted that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You were not going 

to give us the money, right?

 MR. PHILLIPS: And they still want that.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And we still have a 

dispute. So, I tell you what, you are going to sell 

this stuff to Canada, you are going to get some money 

from them, and we have got an agreement that that money 

is ours.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Mr. Chief Justice, that --

that -- they may have been able to make that argument. 

That is not an argument they have made. The argument 

they made, which represents the property at issue in the 

claims, is first, give us back the arms; and then two,

give us the value of those arms, not as they have been 

reformulated in a completely separate contract, give us 

the value of those arms. It seems to me the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, why would 

Cubic enter into a contract with Iran to give them money 

if it wasn't taking the place of the money they owed 

them in the original agreement?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, the question was, they 

were going to try to go forward in these arrangements. 

And it was a, you know, complicated problem because you 

couldn't tell whether or not you would ever be able to 

send things back to Iran, et cetera. And so, they were 

perfectly happy to enter into an agreement where they 

would say, look, we will just do the best we can and see 

how it turns out.

 I mean, in reality, the litigation in front 

of the Ninth Circuit, obviously, on the Cubic judgment, 

Cubic is screaming loud and clear that they don't think 

they owe a nickel as a consequence of this arrangement 

that there had been no breach of anything under any 

circumstances, and that there is not a penny that's to 

be owed. And as counsel said earlier, it's in some ways 

unfortunate that this has moved in this sequence. So, 

we don't really have --

was pending for ten years?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, it was stayed as a 

consequence of this other litigation -- as a consequence 

of these proceedings in order to allow, I think in 

general the Iran claims tribunal to -- to sort out, at 

least, some portion of these issues. It would obvious 

be -- I mean, we have moved -- I mean, we are not a 

party.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So the stayed 

because it was at issue before the Iranian claims 

tribunal?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. I mean, the truth is 

just as the issue was a more important issue for the 

United States prior to the new blocking order, you know, 

the questions that could potentially have arisen were 

potentially more important to the claims tribunal at the 

outset. As the litigation has played out, it turns out 

that there's no relationship between the two.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, the -- the other 

thing -- and I think this counts against you, but maybe 

you have an answer to it, that there could be a lot of 

property that was directly at issue in '79 or '80 that 

Iran didn't get. And because they didn't get it, all 

kinds of things happened with property, and you get more 

of it or you get less of it. And during the interim

years all kinds of things happened.

 And it could be that those transformations 

at different times are directly before the tribunal, 

irrespective to how much damages you are going to get, 

and how much -- we can easily think of cases if we have 

three or four hours. But you see where I am going?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Sure.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, I can understand 

Congress in passing this statute having one of two 

possible things: One is say we are just going to cut an 

arbitrary line here because it's a compromise, and what 

we will do is, you can go ahead, victim, and seize 

anything you want, as long as it doesn't narrowly fit 

within this. That's a somewhat arbitrary line but a 

compromise.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But it also provides 

protection for victims, right, and those are the people 

who are the most --

JUSTICE BREYER: The other way to look at it 

is to say, well, what we that had in mind here is we 

will pay these victims something; you know, they are 

going to get something right from Congress right now, 

because they are hurt. But in return from that, we 

don't want you taking action that will really affect our 

liability to Iran. And if it's the second, then we

needed broader definition; if it's the first, we don't.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Justice Breyer, I think the 

Hague cases are the place to look in terms of trying to 

understand this, because what it's what -- Hague, that 

line of cases all involve efforts to seize consular 

properties of Iran and all arose prior to the Accords, 

and every one of those courts of appeals has concluded 

that each of those properties is beyond the ability of 

the courts to attach all of those properties.

 And -- and it seems to me that what Congress 

was concerned about was having inconsistent claims 

potentially arise in both the district -- in federal 

court in the United States and in front of the claims 

tribunal.

 So where you have a situation where the 

claims tribunal says, look, that's a consular property 

that belongs to the Iranian government, you should 

return it, and have the United States have to show up in 

front of that tribunal and say, oh, excuse me, but 

unfortunately, we have been forced to sell that property 

under a federal court order and the embarrassment that 

arises from that. That seems to me so clearly what 

Congress had in mind, or at least is clearly covered by 

this and the case law or all the case law up to this 

point that has dealt with it has consistently ruled in

favor of the United States and Iran in that context. 

But there is no reason to go beyond that context in 

order to deprive the clear victims of terrorism of a 

meaningful remedy.

 And I think, Justice Breyer, just to be 

clear about this, we got money back, to be sure. A 

substantial portion of the money we got back came from 

the values of the properties that the United States 

seized from Iran that they've used, they have leased out 

embassies and stuff like that. And that is not property 

that comes out of the United States' fist.

 So it's not reasonable to assume, as the 

government does, that simply because these moneys were 

paid out, that there is some huge relinquishment that is 

required there. It seems to me that it makes much more 

sense for this Court to narrowly construe this.

 I guess the last thing I would say in that 

regard is, that insofar as we can tell, this case will 

affect one party -- actually, I guess the other two 

lienholders behind us. But realistically, there are no 

cases in the pipeline. There is no other litigation 

that is on going out there. This is a singular -- I 

mean, it's kind of unusual for this Court, but this is 

the only case that we can figure that this applies to.

is, depending on how it comes out, once you give a 

argument to the Iranians that they can raise with the 

claims tribunal that will affect far more than your one 

single case. We -- the argument would be the United 

States is not living up to the obligations it undertook 

in the Algiers Accords.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. And, 

Mr. Chief Justice, that -- I understand why the 

government filed in support of Certiorari at the earlier 

stages of this proceeding. But after the intervening 

blocking order that takes the -- I mean, that issue is 

off the table.

 We are no longer defending the Ninth 

Circuit's view that the United States breached the 

original Algiers Accords in the context of this case. 

Nothing in the blocking order that is in place now and 

would prevent Iran from getting this remotely violates 

the Algiers Accords. And as far as I know, no one is 

making that argument at this stage. So all you have is 

a relatively clean -- issues. Does the blocking order 

apply here in stopping the payment of these funds to 

Iran? There the answer seems to me unquestionably yes.

 And then the second question is, do we adopt 

a rule to the detriment to a single terrorist victim in 

a way that deprives him of an opportunity to get back

fair redress in the absence of some clear indication 

from Congress that it intended that result where it 

would affect no one else and where Congress has said 

specifically in a rule of construction, put your thumb 

on the scale in favor of the victim of terrorism? 

That's what we are asking the Court to do in this case. 

It provides no problems to the United States in its 

claims tribunal litigation. It's only an issue of 

money.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What provision --

can you cite me the provision where the Congress said 

put your thumb on the scale?

Petitioner's brief at 11a.

that -- the title of the section says statutory 

construction. I just don't see what follows as 

statutory construction.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think what you have 

to do is give the language some credit. And our way --

what we think Congress intended there was to say, tip 

the scale in favor of the victims of terrorism, which is 

the underlying purpose of the statute.

victims under this --

is entitled to suggest, if it's -- if you have ambiguity 

in our language, which way to come out as a matter of

that's dictating -- that's certainly not dictating a 

result in this particular case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Phillips, one piece 

of -- I don't -- you have agreed that the United States 

could recoup from Iran the amount paid to the victims, 

including Dariush Elahi, including the 2.3 million. How 

would the United States go about recouping from Iran the 

money it has paid to the victims of Iran's terrorism?

where the United States has subrogate -- right to

work? How would -- how would the United States --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think it would almost 

certainly work as a matter of diplomacy and not as a 

matter of adjudicated resolution. I think what they 

will say is, these are rights, these are amounts of 

money that we have had to pay. And if we are ever to 

normalize relations with the Government of Iran, we are 

going to expect the Government of Iran to recognize 

those payments and to make some kind of retribution to 

the United States under those circumstances.

 And again, all it does is it shifts the 

burden of these injuries from the victims, who are in 

the least best position to deal with them, and put them 

in the United States, which is in a position of at least 

some hope of being able to resolve them diplomatically 

in a way that the United States can, in fact, be 

recompensed.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You said this is a one of 

a kind case. Are there no other victims who have 

successfully sued Iran?

 MR. PHILLIPS: There are, but the problem is 

you have to back into the situation of property that is 

at issue in the claims tribunal. The claims tribunal 

was created in '81. It's not a lot of that property 

around. We're talking 25 years later. So, they have

pretty much played out their course.

 There were the Hague noted cases, and the 

Elahi case. The others are going to be resolved without 

regard to these provisions. And so, the reality is what 

the Court says today will affect my client, but as far 

as I can tell no one else. And certainly, the only 

interest the United States has at this stage in this 

litigation is its own financial interest. And it would 

seem to me, that's not a basis on which to interpret the 

statute.

 If there are no further questions, I urge 

the Court to affirm.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr. 

Phillips.

 Mr. Bederman, you have two minutes left.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. DAVID J. BEDERMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BEDERMAN: If I can make just a few 

points. In response to Respondent counsel's assertion 

that in the International Chamber of Commerce arbitral 

award there's been so form of novation here, which makes 

the connection between the ACMR and the Cubic judgment 

somehow attenuated. I think that's -- by the 

tribunal's -- the panel's discussion, this is at the 

joint appendix at page 47.

The panel makes very clear that under the 

sales contract credit has to be given to Iran for its 

advance payment. Here you have a breakout of the 

salvage value of the ACMR. All that the panel was 

indicating was that Iran was not entitled to specific 

performance here, to make that ruling is not a finding 

of a novation in the sense which would respond to 

counsel using that phrase. So, I don't see the 

attenuation here.

 Speaking to the assertion that, again, the 

enormous risk presented by this case of the broad 

construction of the congressional intent, I think if you 

look carefully at the language at the blue brief at 11a 

of the statutory construction provision -- that was part 

of the colloquy between the Chief Justice and 

Respondent's counsel. And if you read this, it 

completely reserves, if not begs the question of whether 

the Cubic judgment is, quote, an asset otherwise 

available under the section for attachment.

 So, I think it completely doesn't answer, 

one way or the other -- a finger on the scale, as 

Respondent's counsel has evocably said, or some form of 

command by Congress to this Court. It simply reserves 

that question for the Court's analysis.

 In response to Justice Ginsburg's last

question to Respondent's counsel, the one thing I would 

point out to you again, is another clue in the statute. 

If we look at the Victims Protection Act, which was the 

predecessor statute here, section 2002(c), what Congress 

wanted to protect is the right of the United States to, 

quote, pursue these subrogated rights as claims or 

offsets of the United States in appropriate ways.

 So, again, Congress has contemplated the 

notion that there will be a process of setoffs either 

before the Iran U.S. claims tribunal or in some other 

context, which I'm not sure I can imagine beyond what 

response counsel has said. So, to suggest that the 

broad remedial thrust of TRIA, which Petitioner is not 

denying -- it's not our place to deny that -- is 

nonetheless tempered by these carefully crafted 

provisions in the statute.

 We would support, obviously, reversal of the 

lower court's opinion.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
