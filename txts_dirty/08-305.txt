 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: This morning we will 

first hear argument in Case 08-305, Forest Grove School 

District v. T.A.

 Mr. Feinerman.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY S. FEINERMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FEINERMAN: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The 1997 amendments to IDEA prohibit tuition 

reimbursement awards for students who are unilaterally 

placed in private school without first having received 

special education services from the public school 

district.

 This is so under ordinary principles of 

statutory construction and particularly so under the 

Spending Clause clear notice rule.

 Prior to 1997, IDEA did not expressly 

address tuition reimbursement for unilaterally placed 

students. In 1997, Congress added section 

1412(a)(10)(C). In subsection (i), Congress provided 

that when the school district makes a free appropriate 

public education available, a FAPE, no reimbursement is 

allowed. And then in subsections (ii) through (iv),

Congress addressed situations where courts and hearing 

officers may award tuition reimbursement and said that 

reimbursement may be allowed where the school district 

does not make a FAPE available to a student who 

previously received special education services from the 

public district. Congress said nothing --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feinerman, but the --

the first provision that you read, sub (i), says that 

there will be no reimbursement if the agency has made a 

free appropriate public education available to the child 

and the parents elected to place the child in private 

school. But that "if" -- if the agency made a free 

appropriate public education -- and here, as I 

understand it, the school district said that this child 

was ineligible for special education.

 MR. FEINERMAN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So if the child was 

entitled to a free appropriate public education and 

didn't get it, then under this sub (i), wouldn't the 

parents be entitled to tuition reimbursement?

 MR. FEINERMAN: No. Subsection (i) covers 

students who are provided a free appropriate public 

education. Subsections (ii) through (iv) address the 

other category of students --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that's your --

MR. FEINERMAN: -- those who are not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's your construction. 

But couldn't this be read to say no reimbursement if --

the word is "if" -- the agency, not -- so the 

implication is if the agency did not make a free 

appropriate public education available, then --

MR. FEINERMAN: That -- that might be the 

implication if there weren't subsection (C)(ii) through 

(C)(iv). So it's -- it's T.A.'s argument and the 

government's argument that (C)(i) sets forth the general 

rule, but if that were the way that -- that Congress 

meant the statute to operate, it wouldn't have had any 

reason to put in (C)(ii) through (C)(iv) because we 

would already know from (C)(i) that tuition 

reimbursement was a possibility for students who did not 

receive -- previously receive special education services 

from the public district.

 Congress instead went on in (C)(ii) through 

(C)(iv) to address very specifically, in the context of 

a comprehensive statutory scheme, when tuition 

reimbursement would be available to students who did not 

previously receive. And Congress specified, after 

essentially being invited to do so in Burlington, which 

of those students could get tuition reimbursement. And

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, (ii) through 

(iv) don't -- don't limit or contradict any explicit 

requirement of (i).

 MR. FEINERMAN: Oh, no. It --

JUSTICE SCALIA: (i) is only at most a 

negative implication, which -- which one would not draw 

in light of (ii) through (iv), is what you're saying.

 MR. FEINERMAN: Yes, that's exactly what I'm 

saying. And -- and they deal with different sets of 

students. In (i), the school district has made a FAPE 

available; in (ii) through (iv), the school district has 

not made a FAPE available. And no mention is made of 

when a FAPE is not made available to a student who had 

not previously received.

 And under this Court's decision in 

Arlington, because those students like T.A. who had not 

previously received, are not mentioned, yet Congress --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then -- then what happens 

in a case which I think is like this one, where the 

child doesn't receive special education because the 

school has determined that the child is not eligible? 

So the child isn't getting public education, and in the 

parents' view, confirmed by experts, the child is in 

need of special education, can't get it from the public 

schools, because they declared the child ineligible.

What is such a parent to do?

 MR. FEINERMAN: If -- if it's an incorrect 

determination by the school district, the problem is 

remedied rather quickly. There are very tight time 

frames in IDEA --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, the parents here 

didn't -- didn't run off to a private school only after 

the school district had found that their child didn't 

require any special education, did they?

 MR. FEINERMAN: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they put him in a 

private school without even consulting the schools.

 MR. FEINERMAN: Right. And then only after 

the fact went to the school district and asked for --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Saying by the way, we can 

get some money. How much -- how much money are you 

talking about imposing on the school district here?

 MR. FEINERMAN: Well, it's -- the tuition is 

$5,200 a month.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: A month?

 MR. FEINERMAN: Yes, and then there's a 

$5,200 alumni services fee, a $1,500 interview fee. But 

let's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Mr. Feinerman, can we go 

back to the time frame again? I've just got a question

of fact. I should know this, but I don't. You said 

that if the -- if the parents and the school district 

disagree, it can be remedied fairly quickly because 

there's a fairly tight schedule set for the 

administrative procedure. What I don't remember, and my 

question is this: When the administrative steps have 

been exhausted, if there is still disagreement, is there 

any limit on the time in which the -- the judicial 

appeal has to be resolved?

 MR. FEINERMAN: No, there isn't. So --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that the -- isn't 

that the kicker here? In other words, I -- I fully 

understand your -- your textual argument. I -- I can 

see its soundness as a possibility that is open to us 

and, perhaps on the face of it, the most likely 

possibility, but there is a cost, and the cost, it seems 

to me, is that once you get into the -- once you get 

into appeals, this thing can go on for years, and you 

can't wait years when -- when a kid is in this kind of 

condition.

 MR. FEINERMAN: That's correct, but there's 

no need to wait years. Let's assume that parents 

actually went through the process appropriately, unlike 

T.A.'s parents --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if you can explain

what the process is --

MR. FEINERMAN: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- because Justice Scalia 

said the parents just went away. The school at an 

earlier point said this child was ineligible for special 

education, isn't that so? I think --

MR. FEINERMAN: That's correct. That was in 

2001, and the district judge, at --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.

 MR. FEINERMAN: -- at page 39 of the 

petition to the -- of the appendix to the petition, page 

39 note 3, the district judge noted that the 2001 

evaluation is an appropriate part of this case. But for 

this -- for the parents who try and get their student --

get their student evaluated, the school district says, 

"No. The child is ineligible"; and then the parents --

at that point, the timing kicks in. The parents can ask 

for a due process hearing the next day. Under the time 

periods that were in place when T.A.'s case was going 

through --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that hearing --

MR. FEINERMAN: -- the hearing officer --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that hearing on 

eligible or not, or is it on what the IEP should be?

 MR. FEINERMAN: Well, it's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: When the school said not 

eligible, is there -- is that question resolved first 

before we ever get to the IEP?

 MR. FEINERMAN: I think, in a situation 

where the school district finds the child ineligible and 

there is an appeal, both the eligibility and the 

appropriate placement are decided in front of the 

hearing officer. And there was a 45-day time period at 

the time T.A.'s case went through for the hearing 

officer to make a decision. And then after that, it's 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, wouldn't the school 

say, we -- we have no obligation to get up an IEP until 

the question of eligibility is determined?

 MR. FEINERMAN: I suppose if the school 

district were to get a stay of the hearing officer's 

decision pending appeal to the district court. But 

that's not what happened here. What happened here is 

that the hearing officer decided on June -- January 26, 

2004, that T.A. was eligible. On February 19th, quicker 

than the 30 days allowed, Forest Grove School District 

proposed an IEP that could have started as soon as 

possible thereafter, as the regulations require.

 So you are talking about a very tight -- I 

understand the situation that you are hypothesizing,

Justice Ginsburg, but we are talking about a very tight 

turnaround in T.A.'s case, 75 days, which is a matter of 

weeks, not a matter of years as was the case in 

Burlington.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What happens when we get to 

court?

 MR. FEINERMAN: Excuse me?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: What happens when we get to 

court? Isn't that when it turns into a matter of years?

 MR. FEINERMAN: It turns into a matter of 

years, but in the interim this school district, Forest 

Grove School District, while it was litigating in the 

district court, Forest Grove School District offered an 

IEP, and at that point T.A.'s parents could have tried 

the IEP out, sent the child to receive services in the 

public school district --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The IEP -- they did the 

IEP after the hearing officer was finished?

 MR. FEINERMAN: Yes. Less than 4 weeks 

after the hearing officer was finished, Forest Grove 

offered an IEP, and that's in the addendum to our reply 

brief.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But I think we've 

got to assume that Congress has some concern for the 

parents who correctly say, this IEP is no good, it just

can't be done in the school system, and the kid needs a 

special school. In that case, maybe -- your answer may 

be that's the exceptional case and it shouldn't drive 

the -- the inferences to be drawn about congressional 

intent. But in that case, if the district and the 

parents are at good faith loggerheads it can go on for a 

long, long time, can't it?

 MR. FEINERMAN: It can go on for a long, 

long time if the parents file for a due process hearing, 

and that it can --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but they get the due 

process hearing. The ultimate result is that the school 

proposes an IEP; the parents, based on what their 

experts tell them, say that isn't going to work, and the 

parents say the only way we can educate this kid without 

his falling behind more is to put him in a private 

school. At that point, with assuming good faith here, 

it seems to me you get into court and it can go on for a 

long time, if we accept your -- your analysis of the 

text.

 MR. FEINERMAN: But all the parents have to 

do in that situation is to give the IEP a try and send 

their child to public school.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but doesn't that get 

to the point of something pretty formalistic? I mean,

somebody in the brief said, given one day under the IEP 

and the -- if you win, ultimately the check can be 

written. That can't be right.

 MR. FEINERMAN: I don't think one day could 

be right. The statute says -- it -- it expressly says 

"who previously received special" -- "special education 

service under the authority of a public agency." It 

doesn't say how long it has to be.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Maybe -- I'm sorry.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I remember, perhaps 

incorrectly, from the prior argument here that the 

period that they had to try out the school plan was ten 

days?

 MR. FEINERMAN: That -- that's a 

discretionary factor that courts and hearing officers 

can -- it's not a hard and fast rule.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Not a hard and fast 

rule.

 MR. FEINERMAN: But I think it's probably 

good as a general benchmark.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So is that -- is 

that a period that your client's prepared to accept?

 MR. FEINERMAN: Yes, so long as -- in the 

ordinary case, ten days would -- it's in the statute, so 

we have that textual indication. And it will provide

the school district a chance to provide services under 

the IEP.

 And as this Court mentioned in a prior case, 

IEP's -- it's not an exact science and when you look at 

it on a piece of paper it's hard to know whether it's 

going to work or not. The way you find out whether it 

works is where the rubber hits the road and it could be 

that the parents look at IEP and say, you know what, I 

don't think this is going to work. But until you 

actually give it a chance to work -- maybe the child 

goes in and -- and works with the special education 

teacher or the instructional assistant and they really 

hit it off.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Do you think that's 

realistic? If the parents are convinced going in that 

this is an inappropriate IEP and they send the child to 

school for ten days under the IEP, at the end of the ten 

days they are going to say, oh, well, we've completely 

changed our mind, now we think this is a good plan?

 MR. FEINERMAN: It's certainly plausible 

under certain circumstances. It -- it may not happen 

every time. And it may not happen half the time.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it also plausible 

that the district will say, ten days is not a fair trial 

for this system, this is a child with severe learning

disabilities and to give this IEP a fair chance we need 

ten months?

 MR. FEINERMAN: At that point those 

arguments can be made under (C)(iii) and (C)(iv) because 

at that point the child would no -- the parents would no 

longer be categorically barred from seeking tuition 

reimbursement and those are arguments that you can make 

to the hearing officer.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But you are basically 

saying that the -- that the only necessary delay in 

order to satisfy a condition for eligibility, if the 

parents otherwise prevail, is a ten-day delay. That's 

basically your answer?

 MR. FEINERMAN: I -- I don't think I'm 

saying that. I'm saying --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: This school does not have 

to come up with an IEP. It could tough it out and say, 

we're going to rest on our belief that this child does 

not need any special education, right? And unless the 

school proposes an IEP, the parent cannot come within 

subsection (2) by sending the kid to get the special 

services.

 MR. FEINERMAN: I think that assumes that 

the school district is not going to abide by the order

of the independent hearing officer. And in this -- in 

our case.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: What about before? The 

whole point is that under the words of the statute as 

you interpret it, there is a condition predicate that 

has to be satisfied. So, to say that -- to answer by 

saying, well, that assumes they won't obey the hearing 

officer, what about before the hearing even takes place?

 MR. FEINERMAN: Right. Before the hearing 

takes place, there is 45 days, and then well, the 

hearing -- there's a request for a due process hearing, 

the hearing officer has 45 days, and then if the hearing 

officer says this child is eligible, district, you must 

propose an IEP, the district has 30 days after that.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, what happens in the 

case where --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Could the district appeal? 

That's the end of the road? Can't the district say the 

hearing officer is wrong?

 MR. FEINERMAN: Absolutely, the district can 

appeal.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And if it does, does it 

have to take any action in the interim.

 MR. FEINERMAN: I suppose it, yes, unless it 

gets a stay of the hearing officer's ruling.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which is --

MR. FEINERMAN: But that didn't happen here 

and I am not aware of any cases which it did happen. In 

this case there are two tracks. The hearing officer 

said: T.A. is eligible; prepare an IEP. The district 

said: I disagree; I'm going to appeal to the district 

court.

 But in t mean time, within less than 28 

days, t district prepared an IEP and offered it to T.A. 

And at that point T.A. could have accepted the services, 

thus rendering him eligible for tuition reimbursement.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: I still don't understand 

your answer to Justice Scalia. What if the school board 

just was adamant that he is not entitled to any special 

education? It just maintained that position throughout 

the litigation?

 MR. FEINERMAN: I think the assumption is 

that the school district would not abide by a lawful 

order of a hearing officer.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, they got a stay and 

they wanted to appeal it. And if they did what happens?

 MR. FEINERMAN: In that situation there 

would be no -- and I'm not aware of that situation ever 

happening --

under your view of the law as I understand it. They 

could take that position and they would never be 

liable -- never be liable.

 MR. FEINERMAN: There would be a delay in 

that situation, but I'm not aware of any case where that 

situation -- where a school district.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's the consequence 

of your position as I understand it, that they could do 

that and they would not have any risk of liability.

 MR. FEINERMAN: I think that's a 

hypothetical risk, because again I haven't seen any 

situations where that actually has occurred.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but it's not that 

hypothetical when -- there are two prongs. Number one, 

the school has to agree first with the diagnosis, which 

in this case they didn't even do that. They had a good 

faith disagreement. Second, they have to have an 

adequate IEP. So there are two conditions.

 MR. FEINERMAN: That's true, and I think --

I think the answer to the question -- it's really, this 

is really a legislative question. Perhaps Congress 

ought to further amend the statute to say in those 

situations where a school district is being obstreperous 

in refusing to comply with the hearing officer's order, 

in those situations there is going to be an exception to

the exception. But it's not -- it's not the statute 

that Congress wrote. Congress wrote --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Doesn't your 

interpretation of the statute create an incentive for 

the school board to just say, we'll never provide any 

kind of education, special education, we will just tough 

it out? Because they can't lose, they can't be liable 

if they do that, if I understand you correctly.

 MR. FEINERMAN: I -- I suppose 

hypothetically it does, but my understanding is that 

that just doesn't happen. In Schaffer v. Weast and 

other cases, the assumption --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would you be surprised to 

find a court decision which says that when the reason 

that the plaintiff cannot comply with the requirement 

that he first be in a plan, when the reason is -- is the 

district's refusal to abide by an order to prepare a 

plan, that subsection (2) does not apply?

 MR. FEINERMAN: Your --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You can't profit by your 

own malfeasance.

 MR. FEINERMAN: That's correct. And I -- I 

don't think there could be reimbursement under 

subsection (ii). Perhaps if there were a parallel 

Rehabilitation Act claim under 504, that might be a

vehicle to get relief in a situation where the school 

district is acting as horribly as being hypothesized, 

but not under --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But you -- you don't think 

-- you don't think a court could say the only reason 

these people could not comply with (ii) is that the 

school district made it impossible by not complying with 

the order to provide an IEP; and, therefore, they --

they can recover for the private placement?

 MR. FEINERMAN: It's conceivable that --

that a court could hold that. A court could also --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think it's more than 

conceivable. I know a lot of courts that would hold 

that.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But your position is that 

there are basically two situations: One, the situation 

in which there is an administrative order to do an IEP 

and the school district says, no, we won't do it. 

Millions for defense; we are going right into appeal, 

and we are not going to prepare the IEP. In that 

situation, as I understand it, you are saying, the 

parents have no way of getting relief under the statute.

 In the case in which there is an order for 

the IEP and the school district prepares the IEP, even 

though the parents think it will be inadequate, there in

fact is a ready remedy subject to two delays: One, the 

time to prepare the IEP; and, two, ten days to give it a 

try before the parents take the kid out of school. 

That's basically the scheme that you are proposing that 

the statute provides; is -- is that correct?

 MR. FEINERMAN: That's the scheme that 

Congress wrote in the statute, yes, under -- under 

(C)(ii). And it has to work that way, because -- I want 

to come back to a -- to a point that was aired in the 

briefs, which is T.A.'s argument and the government's 

argument rests upon the notion that section 

1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) gives hearing officers the authority 

to award tuition reimbursement. That provision doesn't 

give hearing officers any authority to do anything, let 

alone to award tuition reimbursement.

 The only provision in IDEA that gives 

hearing officers the authority to award tuition 

reimbursement is 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). So if the statute 

doesn't work -- the statute doesn't work, and the 

Secretary's interpretation of 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) is 

implausible because it accords to hearing officers the 

authority that it doesn't have.

 There is another textual clue why the 

statute works in the way that I am suggesting, and that 

is in the '97 amendments in subsections (iii) and (iv)

Congress gave very explicit guidance to courts and 

hearing officers as to the factors the court and hearing 

officer should consider when deciding whether to award 

tuition reimbursement to a student who previously 

received special education services.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The -- the problem that 

the government and the parents have is they have to give 

some work to (ii). Under -- under their view (ii) 

doesn't seem to do much work.

 And the problem with your position is that 

it seems in a way formalistic and in some cases to 

encourage intransigence. If we adopted a presumption 

that the school district's diagnosis was correct and a 

presumption that it's -- if -- if there was a diagnosis 

of disability, that its individual education program was 

adequate, that would, it seems to me, not be all you 

wanted, but would ameliorate the position of the school 

district. Would we have authority, do you think, to 

adopt such a presumption?

 MR. FEINERMAN: I think the -- the Court 

already has adopted that presumption in Schaffer v. 

Weast. School districts are presumed to be acting in 

good faith.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, this -- this would 

be a clear and convincing evidence presumption that the

you -- that's not all you would be asking for.

 MR. FEINERMAN: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But would we have 

authority to do that if we were to reject your 

interpretation of the statute?

 MR. FEINERMAN: I suppose you would have the 

authority to do that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: How have -- how have 

hearing officers been proceeding? I mean, here we had a 

case that went to a hearing officer. There is no IEP 

when the hearing officer begins the process. In the --

on the eligibility or not, do hearing officers give 

deference to the school district and then -- so that's 

eligibility. At the IEP stage, do they give deference 

to the student?

 MR. FEINERMAN: There is some deference 

given to -- are you talking about the deference that the 

district court gives to the hearing officer?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, the hearing officer. 

The hearing officer is the first-level decisionmaker. 

And the school board gives its reasons why it thinks the 

child is ineligible; the parent, the reasons that the 

child is eligible. That's the threshold determination.

On that threshold determination of 

eligibility, do hearing officers presume in favor of the 

school district?

 MR. FEINERMAN: Not -- not in this case. In 

this case under Oregon law at the time -- and this was a 

pre-Schaffer decision -- the hearing officer put the 

burden of proof on the school --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel --

MR. FEINERMAN: -- on the question of 

eligibility.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- why isn't it the 

case that the school's diagnosis is a related service 

under the statutory provision? It seems to me to be 

very important service to the parents to know what the 

school's diagnosis is.

 MR. FEINERMAN: I -- I think that the 

diagnosis is more in terms of eligibility. It's 

under -- under (b)(6), the hearing officer can decide --

can consider issues of identification, eligibility, and 

placement.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, I'm talking 

about what the parents received. And they receive a 

diagnosis, and the statute covers -- asks whether they 

previously received special education and related 

services. Diagnosis would seem to me to be a service

related to special education.

 MR. FEINERMAN: I -- I don't think that's 

the way it works. A diagnosis -- a finding of 

eligibility or not is not a diagnosis. It is just an 

eligibility finding, and that's something that the 

parents can take to a -- a due process hearing under 

1415(f).

 If there are no further questions, I will 

reserve the remainder of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. SALMONS: That you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 The school district in this case improperly 

denied T.A., a child with a disability who had always 

been enrolled in public schools, access to all public 

special education services. It asserts that because its 

wrong eligibility determinations prevented T.A. from 

receiving special education services, it is immune from 

reimbursing T.A.'s parents the cost of obtaining those 

services from another source.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: What is wrong with 

ten days? I mean it's -- it's a big expense you are

asking the school district to incur, that will take away 

funds from other programs. And all -- all they are 

saying is give it a try for ten days, and if it doesn't 

work out, then you can go?

 MR. SALMONS: I think there are several 

problems with that reading of the statute, Your Honor. 

First of all, the ten-day period that is referenced in 

subsection (C)(iii) refers to the amount of notice that 

a district needs to receive before a child is removed 

from the public school system.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, yes, the first 

day -- the first day they say, look, we don't think this 

is going to work out, so we are notifying you what we 

are going to do. And they say, well, you've got to do 

that in ten days, and they said, okay, ten days.

 MR. SALMONS: But that's -- that's simply 

not the way these things work as a general matter, and 

let me just point out a few things about the normal 

process of developing IEP's. And, again, here the child 

never even got that far. But, typically, IEP's are 

developed at the end of the -- of a school year for the 

following year. And the parents at that point have a 

period of time in which to decide to go along with that 

plan or to give notice and then make alternative 

arrangements.

And it's simply the -- I mean -- and that's 

the way it works, because it's important for parents to 

be able to get their child in an alternative program if 

they decide that's what they want to do. And if you 

wait until the school year has already started, those 

may not be available. And the ten-day notice 

requirement --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I suppose 

that's right, but once the law is clarified, schools 

that specialize in -- in treating these kids would be 

able -- they would understand as well, and they would 

understand you've got to -- the people who are going to 

be sending -- most of the people who will be sending 

their children to the school have to wait ten days. And 

it seems to me that the actual practice on the ground 

would work out pretty easily.

 MR. SALMONS: But, again, Your Honor, if you 

focus on the terms of the statute, the -- even under 

Petitioner's reading, the requirement would be to have 

previously received special education services, not to 

have tried out a particular plan.

 It may be the case that the plan for the 

upcoming year is -- is very different than the plan for 

the prior year. Perhaps they have had another 

assessment, and they had substantially changed --

 MR. SALMONS: Well, I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Here's a -- here's a 

new plan. We've worked on it. Here it is. At least 

give it ten days -- two school week tries.

 MR. SALMONS: I think the way that cuts, 

Your Honor, is -- is that that reading of what you are 

positing, I guess, in this exchange what Congress might 

have had in mind, is not what they said in the statute. 

They did not require parents to try out a particular 

plan; just that at some point in time they had 

previously received special education services.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: With respect, 

counsel, what Congress provided is that the child must 

have previously received special education and related 

services.

 MR. SALMONS: That's right.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So I think they did 

provide that you've got to try it out at least for a 

minimal period.

 MR. SALMONS: But not the particular plan 

that is the subject of the IEP, Your Honor. That --

that connection does not exist in the statute. And --

and we think it's counter to what Congress intended.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay. So what type 

of special education services do you think do count as 

having been previously received?

 MR. SALMONS: Well -- well, if I -- if I 

may, the way we read this provision, and it's set forth 

on pages 3 and 4 on the addendum to the blue brief, and 

we think it's important that we read this as a whole and 

in context, is that subsection (C)(i) provides the 

general rule to govern the payment of private school 

tuition based on a unilateral placement by the parents. 

And subsection (C)(i) creates the only expressed 

limitation on the right to reimbursement, and it does so 

only in instances where the school district has provided 

a free and appropriate public education.

 We think subsection (C)(ii), (C)(iii), and 

(C)(iv) work together to govern the subset of cases that 

is Congress was most concerned about and that, in fact, 

are the most common scenario in which these disputes 

have arised.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Except that you are reading 

(C)(i) to say something that it doesn't say. It just 

says you don't have to pay if the agency has made a free 

appropriate public education available.

 MR. SALMONS: That is what --

must pay whenever it hasn't made, and it just doesn't 

say that. It -- it's a safe harbor for the school 

district. It says, so long as you've made an 

appropriate public education available, you can't be 

liable for any -- any private school tuition.

 Now, you want to expand that to say, and 

whenever that condition doesn't exist, you are liable. 

But it really doesn't say that. And -- and the later 

sections suggest that it meant not to say that.

 MR. SALMONS: Well, that's where we part 

company, Your Honor, because, in fact, that negative 

inference that you refer to is precisely what 

Petitioners attempt to read into subsection (C)(ii). 

There is nothing in subsection (C)(ii) that provides any 

restriction on the ability to obtain reimbursement. It 

was written in permissive language.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In reading -- in 

reading it that way, you are reading the phrase "who 

previously received special education services" to mean 

also who previously did not receive special education 

services.

 MR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. We are simply 

not reading that language "who previously received" to 

be a condition precedent.

matter whether they previously received or not.

 MR. SALMONS: It does matter, Your Honor, 

because the provisions that follow in (C)(iii) and 

(C)(iv) that guide the exercise of discretion, in that 

category of cases that were of concern to Congress, only 

apply to the cases that are defined in subsection 

(C)(ii). So in our reading the language "who previously 

received" still serves an important purpose, but it 

serves an identifying purpose for the limiting factors 

provided in (C)(iii) and (C)(iv). It does not serve --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So you are saying 

Congress went to the trouble of spelling out this 

elaborate provision in (C)(iii) and (ii) and all the 

other things, but that was not the universe of the 

situations in which there could be reimbursement? They 

went to that trouble, but then -- at the end you want to 

say or some other provisions or some other 

circumstances?

 MR. SALMONS: Well, that's right. We think 

that Congress was focused on a particular set of cases 

where problems had arisen, and that's where you already 

had a child in the process of receiving special 

education and you had parents who removed the child out 

of that process without giving adequate notice, and 

thereby short -- excuse me -- short-circuiting an

ongoing collaborative relationship that Congress wanted 

to preserve.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, but if -- if you avoid 

that collaborative relationship entirely and just run 

off to a prior -- to a private school right away, you 

get reimbursement. Why?

 MR. SALMONS: Well you don't automatically 

get reimbursement.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why would Congress -- huh?

 MR. SALMONS: You don't -- you don't 

automatically get reimbursement, Your Honor. There is 

just no categorical bar to seeking reimbursement. You 

still have to show it's an appropriate remedy, which 

always has been understood to require a showing that the 

parents acted reasonably and in good faith, and that 

they were sincere in their efforts to obtain services 

from the school.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What about more than that?

 MR. SALMONS: The alternative --

opportunity for a free appropriate public education.

 With respect to children in private school 

who are not seeking a free appropriate public school 

education from the public school district, the only 

requirement under the Act is that you seek them out, you 

find them, you identify them, and that you report that 

to the Department of Education, and that you get money 

for those children. And for those children who are not 

enrolled in public school, you have to use a percentage

disabled child, you simply go to a private school, you 

get the services you just mentioned.

public school, and they find a free appropriate public 

education, fine, that's the end of that, you have to do 

it. Now, if they don't give you a decent one, you can, 

you can send the child to a private school, but it 

has -- you have to give it a shot to the public school 

system.

 Now, that's what you don't want the 

interpretation to be? You don't -- you are against

JUSTICE BREYER: You haven't heard my 

amendment.

 MR. SALMONS: Okay. I'm sorry, Your Honor. 

Go ahead.

 JUSTICE BREYER: My amendment is the norm 

will be give the public school a shot, but there could 

be circumstances, you're getting the run-around, there 

is need to put that child in a public school now. In 

other words, special equitable circumstances that make 

it reasonable for the parent not to give the school a 

shot, though that's the norm. And in those unusual 

circumstances, there would remain grounds for equitable 

relief.

 What about that as an overall interpretation 

of the statute which has several parts to it?

 MR. SALMONS: I would submit that the way we 

read the statute, Your Honor, in fact, does precisely 

that. Because, the school district -- just again, take 

this --

JUSTICE BREYER: But you have to be willing 

to accept that it's an unusual situation, though it may 

well exist, that the judge is going to reimburse the 

parent where that parent didn't give the public school a 

shot. They will have to show there is a good reason for 

not doing that.

MR. SALMONS: The -- the difficulty I 

have --

JUSTICE BREYER: Is that all right with you 

or not?

 MR. SALMONS: Well, the difficulty I have 

with your question, Your Honor, is that the school 

district always has a shot under the Act. In this case, 

the school district assessed the child in 2001 and again 

in 2003, and both times it erroneously concluded 

that the child --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, you are simply saying 

that it was reasonable for the parent here. I'm not 

asking that question.

 MR. SALMONS: No, not just that it's 

reasonable, but in the process of assessing the child, 

in developing an individual education plan that is 

appropriate for that child, that is precisely the shot 

that the statute gives the public school system to get 

it right. What the statute does --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Salmons, I thought 

that the -- the courts, the district court, will not 

provide for tuition reimbursement, unless at least two 

things are shown. One is that the school district did 

not provide an adequate education for this child. And 

two, that the private school did, and then there are

equitable considerations.

 MR. SALMONS: That is absolutely correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So you must find both, 

not just that the private school was a good place, but 

that the school district did not offer an adequate 

education for the child.

 MR. SALMONS: That is -- that is correct. 

That is what this Court held in Carter. That's what the 

regulations say. I would note that there is nothing in 

the text of the statute and the provisions that 

Petitioner relies on, (C)(ii) for example, that makes it 

a statutory requirement to show that the private 

placement is reasonable as a -- as a condition precedent 

to obtain tuition reimbursement. But both sides concede 

that that's required, even though it's not in the 

statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But procedurally we -- we 

know that there is a provision addressed to a court for 

equitable relief. The question was put before: Where 

does the hearing officer get the authority to order 

tuition reimbursement? Because the statute on which you 

rely for the court speaks only to the court's authority.

 MR. SALMONS: Thank you, Your Honor. I am 

happy to answer that question. But Petitioner makes 

this a centerpiece of their reply brief and I think they

just misread the statute. And again, keep in mind that 

these amendments in 1997 were written against a backdrop 

of this longstanding statute and this Court's 

interpretations of it. The most direct place where the 

statute provides hearing officers the authority to hear 

address reimbursement claims and to award 

reimbursement -- and this is on page 9 of the addendum 

in the blue brief -- is 1415(b)(6). This has always 

been in the statute and it states that the parents must 

be provided an opportunity to present complaints with 

respect to "any matter relating to the identification, 

evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or 

the provision of a free appropriate public education to 

such child."

 That is -- again, that has always been 

understood to include the right to seek reimbursement 

before the hearing officer. And this Court in 

Burlington cited legislative history from the 1975 Act 

that noted that hearing officers could award 

reimbursement and address such claims in concluding that 

it was part of the appropriate relief that courts ought 

to be able to have under 1415.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Are any of these other 

procedures -- I took these to be procedures that have to 

be provided by the school district, not -- not by the

 MR. SALMONS: These are -- these are 

required -- this whole section, Your Honor, 1412, is 

entitled "State Eligibility," and these are all 

requirements that States have to provide for process in 

order to obtain funds under the Act, and so it is a 

requirement that States provide hearing officers that 

have the ability to award reimbursement --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't say hearing 

officers. "An opportunity to present complaints with 

respect to any matter relating to the identification" --

MR. SALMONS: Those complaints --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- to present the complaint 

to the principal.

 MR. SALMONS: No, Your Honor. This is a 

reference to the due process complaint notice that is 

referenced elsewhere in the statute. I believe 

Petitioner would agree with me that that's what this 

references.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but the reference is to 

a right to be heard on certain subjects. It doesn't say 

anything about authorizing a particular individual or 

officer within a school system to award relief. The 

problem is, it says you can be heard. It doesn't say 

who will tell you or who will tell the school district

to write a check.

 MR. SALMONS: Right. But keep in mind that 

the judicial review process that the statute provides --

and this is at page 17 of the addendum. The right to 

file a Federal action is limited to those matters that 

are raised in the due process complaint notice filed 

before the hearing officer. This is an exhaustion 

requirement.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But can you raise the --

you can raise the claim to eligibility to a -- a private 

education here without the hearing officer having the 

authority to order the school district to provide it.

 MR. SALMONS: That has not been the 

interpretation of this Act, Your Honor, and I would 

refer the Court to 34 CFR 300.148(b), which is a 

regulation that states that hearing officers can award 

reimbursement and that has been around since the mid-

1980s. My point is that is -- the Congress enacted 

these amendments in 1997 against a subtle understanding 

of how this Act works. And it's always been understood 

that hearing officers can award reimbursement. There 

was no need to provide in the '97 amendments that 

hearing officers can also award relief.

 And again because it's an -- it's an 

exhaustion requirement and the judicial review provision

only relates to the things that you have raised before 

the hearing officer, it makes no sense to say a court 

can award reimbursement but you can't get reimbursement 

from the hearing officer. That's the subject of the 

review of the Federal court action.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but it might make 

senses to say that the hearing officer can determine 

eligibility; it is then up to the school to pay it; and 

if the school does not pay it, then you have got to go 

into court and get an award.

 MR. SALMONS: In fact, Your Honor, the 

hearing officers have always been permitted to award 

reimbursement, as occurred in this case, and then the 

school district can decide either to pay that or to seek 

review if they -- if they so choose.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And it might make also 

sense to say that if the hearing officer has no 

authority to award a certain type of relief, neither 

does a court, under that general provision that --

MR. SALMONS: But of course this Court in 

Burlington held the court did have that authority and it 

relied on the fact that it has always been understood 

that hearing officers have that authority in reaching 

that conclusion in Burlington.

with these new provisions, if the hearing officer 

doesn't have the authority to award the kind of relief 

that was awarded here, then the court wouldn't either.

 MR. SALMONS: Well, I -- with respect, I 

think there is nothing in the '97 amendments --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you agree they go, as 

we say, in pari passu --

MR. SALMONS: Well, I do think that it 

doesn't make sense to say --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- that -- that whatever 

the hearing officer can do, the court can do.

 MR. SALMONS: I think generally --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- and whatever he can't 

do, the court can't do.

 MR. SALMONS: I think they ought to be read 

together, yes, Your Honor. But I think they ought to be 

read to provide for the authority to provide tuition 

reimbursement.

 One statutory point I would like to make, 

Your Honor, is that under Petitioner's reading of the 

Act, if you read (C)(ii) to be -- that reference to "who 

previously received" to be an absolute precondition, 

then I think it's the case that (C)(i) has no meaning 

whatsoever. It does not work under the Act at all. 

Whereas on our reading of the statute, (C)(ii) still

does work. It's not a precondition; it doesn't do the 

work that Petitioner suggests; it does a more limited --

serve a more limited function, but it still serves that 

identifying role for the factors Congress wanted applied 

when it was focused on how to preserve relationships, 

ongoing collaborative relationships through the IEP 

process that warrant preservation.

 One other point I make, Your Honor, and 

Justice Scalia, you make reference to this principle of 

equity, that you ought not be allowed to prevent 

something from happening and then come into court and 

claim, "Ha, ha, they didn't satisfy a condition." And 

that was a point that was made by Justice Cardozo in the 

R.H. Stearns case that we rely on, where he said he who 

prevents a thing from being done may not avail himself 

of the nonperformance which he himself has occasioned.

 That's precisely what happened here. As 

this case to this Court, it is established that is a 

child who was entitled to receive special education 

services back in 2001. The only reason he did not 

receive those services is because the district violated 

its statutory duties --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought in 2001 even 

the parents agreed that he didn't -- that they didn't 

want to put him in special education?

disabilities they tested him for, but they had an 

obligation under the Act -- and this was found by the 

hearing officer and the complaint that was filed was 

filed within the two-year limitation to challenge that 

2001 determination, and that that was there, they had an 

obligation to test him for those other health 

impairments at that time.

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

 MR. MILLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Had Petitioner provided T.A. a special 

education that was later determined to be inadequate, 

there would be no question that the district court would 

have authority and discretion to determine whether an 

award of private school tuition reimbursement was 

appropriate. Petitioner's view is that because it 

offered no special education at all, it was therefore

categorically immune from such an award. That position 

is not supported by the statute and it's inconsistent 

with the reasonable interpretation of the Secretary of 

Education.

 There is no basis for reading the statute to 

create what effectively would be an incentive for 

districts to stonewall and to say that if they don't --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, for 10 days, 

right? Even assuming the bad faith that you are 

ascribing to the school district, it would only work for 

10 days, right?

 MR. MILLER: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And then they would 

have -- then they would have previously received special 

education services, and they could proceed.

 MR. MILLER: We were not assuming bad faith. 

Or --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: "Stonewall" sounds 

to me like bad faith.

 MR. MILLER: Well there --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That was the word 

you used.

 MR. MILLER: I -- Congress -- there is no 

reason to suppose that Congress wanted to create an 

incentive or to reward districts that do do that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we are talking about 

two different things. I think the Chief was talking 

about putting the child in special education, and 

keeping the child there for 10 days. You are talking 

about the school district that says "no special 

education; this child is not eligible."

 MR. MILLER: That's absolutely right. So in 

a case like this, there is -- there is nothing to try 

for 10 days because the district has found him not 

eligible, they haven't offered any special education or 

related services. Now to the extent --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, let's move to 

the situation where they have a plan that the parents 

regard as inadequate.

 MR. MILLER: In the case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In that situation 

all they would have to do is to have the child try the 

plan for 10 days.

 MR. MILLER: Well if the -- to the extent 

that there is an interest in having parents try out the 

plan, Petitioner's reading of the statute is poorly 

tailored to that objective, because it doesn't require 

that they try the specific plan that's being proposed 

for 10 days.

simply would require that the child at some point have 

received some special education and related services. 

It wouldn't have to be under the plan that was being 

tried. And --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But the odds are that it 

would be under the plan. I mean, what you say is 

theoretically possible, but in the real world it's 

probably going to be under the plan, isn't it?

 MR. MILLER: Well, not necessarily because 

there's a new plan at least once a year under the 

statute, and they are typically proposed at the end of a 

school year for the start of the new school year. So 

there wouldn't be, on Petitioner's reading, a 

requirement that you show up for the first 10 days of 

the new year; you would just have to give notice after 

the IEP is proposed in May or June. You give your 10 

days' notice. You receive special education services 

under the old plan, under the previous year. And under 

-- on Petitioner's reading, the statute would be no 

barrier to reimbursement there.

 Now, of course, the district courts do have 

considerable equitable discretion, and we're not 

suggesting that reimbursement would be mandatory in that 

case or in any case. And --

think you agree that the parents would have the burden 

of showing both that the school did not provide an 

adequate education, an appropriate education, and that 

the private school does?

 MR. MILLER: That's -- that's absolutely 

right. And they would also, in our view, have to show 

the district court that they had genuinely cooperated 

with the public school in making their child available 

for evaluation --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose we thought it were 

sensible to add to that burden the further rule that the 

school district is presumed to have made the correct 

diagnosis and, if there is a plan in that kind of case, 

that the plan was adequate, and that the parent would 

have to show by clear and convincing evidence that this 

is not so, rather than just inventing it and pulling it 

out of the sky.

 Is -- is there some authority in the statute 

that would give us warrant to do that? Or is there 

some -- any cases that would give us warrant to -- to 

establish a presumption of that kind in order to 

recognize the long-standing expertise of the States in 

this matter and in order to allow section (ii) to do 

some work?

evidence presumption would be difficult to reconcile, I 

think, with 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), which says that the 

district court decision should be based on the 

preponderance of the evidence, but it is certainly 

within the district court's discretion and it would be 

within this Court's discretion, I think, to prescribe 

principles to guide the exercise of the district courts' 

equitable discretion --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The district court 

doesn't get into the act until the hearing officer is 

done.

 MR. MILLER: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And so it would be odd to 

have a presumption applicable in court that isn't also 

applicable to the hearing officer, because the court is 

reviewing a decision by the hearing officer.

 MR. MILLER: Right. Well, the -- the 

standard in both stages of the proceeding is by a 

preponderance of the evidence, and the parents, as the 

party challenging what the school has done, have the 

burden. But at both stages, it would be appropriate to 

consider whether they were genuinely seeking a free 

appropriate public education, and I think it would be 

entirely appropriate and consistent with the 

preponderance standard for the hearing officer or the

 MR. MILLER: 34 C.F.R. 300.148(b) says that 

disagreements between the parents and a public agency 

regarding the availability of a program appropriate for 

the child and the question of financial reimbursement 

are subject to the due process hearing procedures. So 

yes, that regulation gives hearing officers the 

authority to award reimbursement, as indeed the hearing 

officer had done Burlington. Burlington was the case

where the reimbursement award was made in the first 

instance by a hearing officer, and, of course, the Court 

held that that was appropriate. And --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, this is 

Spending Clause legislation. Do you have any rough idea 

of how much of the obligation incurred by the States is 

reimbursed by the Federal Government? What percentage?

 MR. MILLER: I think of the additional costs 

of treating special education children, above those of 

educating other children, I think approximately 

10 percent, 10 to 12 percent, is reimbursed by the 

Federal Government.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So if this 

interpretation vastly expands the liability of school 

districts in that particular area, isn't that a 

consideration we should consider? Since they accept --

the States accept 10 percent of the funds to incur these 

obligations and then you are expanding the obligation in 

a way that we may at least find is ambiguous, isn't that 

a pertinent factor?

 MR. MILLER: There's no basis for supposing 

that there would be a vast expansion of liability, and 

there are some statistics on this in the National 

Disability Rights Network's amicus brief at pages 13 and

who are receiving special education, barely 1 percent of 

those are in private placements, and the vast majority 

of those are agreed-upon placements between school 

districts and the parents. So this sort of unilateral 

private placement is quite rare, because, first, the 

parents do it at their own financial risk, and so 

there's a real barrier to parents doing it, because they 

have to be pretty sure that they are right and that they 

are going to be able to meet the demanding standards of

tuition reimbursement is appropriate, and if they don't 

do that --

two schools -- private schools in the community, A and 

B. A charges, what is it, $5,200 a month tuition; the 

other is considerably less. And they both have adequate 

programs for the child. Is the hearing examiner 

entitled to reimburse only for the lower amount, or is 

the parent entitled to send the child to the -- to the 

more expensive school?

Carter is that it's appropriate for the hearing officer 

to take into account whether the cost of the private 

education was unreasonable. So in a situation where you 

had two basically equivalent schools, that would 

certainly be an appropriate thing for the hearing 

officer to take into account in limiting or denying 

reimbursement.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Or there could be, I 

suppose, an order that any tuition in excess of a 

certain amount would be the parents' responsibility.

 MR. MILLER: That's -- that's right. That 

would be within the discretion of the hearing officer.

 In a case like this, where you have a 

residential placement and the residential component of 

it -- there has been no suggestion that that was -- had 

some educational purpose or was a part of providing an 

appropriate education, it would also be appropriate for 

the court to decide to disaggregate that and say we are 

only paying -- the school district only has to pay for 

the educational component.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me be clear. Am I 

correct that under -- under the theory of the statute 

that you are supporting, it would be possible for a 

parent, without first consulting with the school at all, 

to put the child in a private school and then later to

request public school services, and when it is -- when 

they are denied or they are inadequate, all that public 

school -- private school tuition would be reimbursable?

 MR. MILLER: There would be no categorical 

bar in the statute in that situation, but a district 

court confronted with those facts would most likely 

conclude that the parents had not genuinely sought a 

free appropriate public education and hadn't 

appropriately cooperated with the school district.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARY S. FEINERMAN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. FEINERMAN: Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice.

 I'd like to address the two provisions that 

we have heard today for the first time. T.A. and the 

government are resting their argument that tuition 

reimbursement is permitted in the unilateral placement 

context to students who had not previous received. The 

regulation 300.148 -- counsel referenced subsection (b), 

Disagreements about FAPE, and it does say that the 

hearing officer can consider the question of financial

reimbursement. And the very next subsection, (c), is 

entitled Reimbursement for Private School Placement, and 

that provision speaks only to students who previously 

received special education and related services under 

the authority of a public agency.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where are you reading 

this?

 MR. FEINERMAN: This isn't -- this 

regulation was brought up at argument. It's not in any 

of the addendums, but I -- I would direct the Court's 

attention to subsection (c) of 300.148.

 In terms of the -- the provision that T.A.'s 

lawyer addressed, 1415(b)(6), no argument -- there's no 

argument in the briefs that 1415(b)(6) gives hearing 

officers the authority to grant tuition reimbursement in 

these circumstances. The Department of Education did 

not rely on this provision when articulating its 

commentary that tuition reimbursement is still permitted 

under these circumstances. The Secretary of Education 

relied upon the 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) provision. That of 

course, refers only to courts.

 And even if the argument were properly 

presented, which it isn't, it would be subject to the 

same dynamic that's in play with respect to 

1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). You have a very general provision

giving hearing officers authority. Congress got 

specific in 1997. There's a heading -- enacted a 

provision under the heading Reimbursement for Private 

School Placement. I think that clearly indicates that's 

where Congress intended to repose the authority of 

hearing officers to order tuition reimbursement to 

unilaterally placed children.

 We also have the -- and -- and it just 

doesn't work to say that 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) somehow 

gives hearing officers authority. Even if it were 

interpreted that way prior to 1997, in 1997 Congress 

enacted the statute that expressly referenced hearing 

officers and courts, and allowed both of them to give 

tuition reimbursement. So even if 1415 were interpreted 

prior to '97 -- incorrectly, we would submit -- to give 

hearing officers that authority, after 1997 where 

Congress actually went to the trouble of saying hearing 

officers and courts can give tuition reimbursement in 

certain circumstances, that -- that prior 

interpretation, whatever its merits back then, no longer 

is valid --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what happens -- what 

happens if the hearing officer can't, but why couldn't 

the court? I mean, they see an unusual situation. The 

parents were justified, and it doesn't say there are no

circumstances other than -- where you couldn't -- where 

they may not pay. So the judge says, I think this is a 

situation where it is -- it is equitable to pay the --

the reimbursement.

 MR. FEINERMAN: That's correct, but --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why not? What says you 

can't do that, other than your basic point about the 

"may require"?

 MR. FEINERMAN: The Spending Clause, the 

headings that Congress used --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. But anyway, the 

regs don't say anything about that.

 MR. FEINERMAN: At any rate -- and it's a 

system that doesn't make any sense, because for children 

who did previously receive and go to the hearing officer 

to challenge either an eligibility determination or an 

improper IEP, the hearing officer could award tuition 

reimbursement, but for children who didn't previously 

receive and then they went in front of the hearing 

officer, they would have to -- I don't know what the 

word would be -- appeal to the district court in order 

to get tuition reimbursement. Is it conceivable that 

that that could be the system --

JUSTICE BREYER: You're saying the statute 

says the hearing officer can't do that no matter what.

be the system.
