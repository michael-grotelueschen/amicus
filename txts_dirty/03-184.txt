 JUSTICE STEVENS: The Court will now hear 

argument in Ballard against the Commissioner of Internal 

Revenue.

 Mr. Shapiro.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN M. SHAPIRO

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Justice Stevens, and 

may it please the Court:

 Judge Cudahy stated in his dissent in the 

Seventh Circuit that disclosure of the rule 183 report in 

this case should be required on both statutory and 

constitutional grounds. As Judge Cudahy put it, there is 

no item of more significance in evaluating a Tax Court's 

decision on fraud than the unfiltered findings of the STJ.

 JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Mr. Shapiro, can this case, 

in your view, be decided solely on the statutory question?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes, Your Honor. We believe 

it can. 

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: There also are due process 

allegations, and I'm not sure I even quite understand what 

the precise due process violation is that's alleged. But 

I would like you to address both and to tell us, first of 

all, how it would be resolved solely on a statutory basis

from your perspective. 

MR. SHAPIRO: The readiest ground for decision 

is the statutory basis, and we believe that the statute is 

a good means to avoid a complex due process question.

 There are two statutes that are key here. One 

is the appellate review statute. The other is the public 

record statute. The public record statute says all 

reports of the Tax Court are public records, and we're 

talking about a report of the Tax Court in this case. 

The legislative history of that provision shows 

Congress had the broadest possible intent to make all 

practices in the Tax Court completely transparent. All 

steps in the adjudication were supposed to be --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, would that include --

if a Tax Court judge had a law clerk, would it include law 

clerk memos to the judge?

 MR. SHAPIRO: We -- we don't take that position. 

It refers to reports of judges, and this is a report of a 

trial judge who heard the witnesses. The report is 

presumed correct under rule 183. It's the only 

independent evaluation of witness credibility --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, why -- why do you say 

that? 

MR. SHAPIRO: -- and the only judge --

JUSTICE BREYER: Would you elaborate for this

reason? Because the briefs and you again today keep 

talking about that first document. You use the word 

report.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, to me that's the whole 

conclusion of the case. I'm prepared to assume, at least 

for the moment, if you can convince me that that's the 

report they're talking about, you'd win. But that isn't 

what the Government says.

 The Government says that's a piece of paper, 

preliminary. We -- like my draft. I write drafts all the 

time. So -- so do trial judges. And he goes and brings 

the draft to the other two judges and says, let's sit down 

and talk about it. And they sit down and talk about it, 

and he changes his mind and writes a different document. 

And that different document, of course, is totally public. 

The whole opinion of the Tax Court. There is that 

document. 

MR. SHAPIRO: There is only one rule 183 report. 

Under the rule, it's the report the trial judge prepares 

and submits to the chief judge at the completion of the 

trial, which contains his independent credibility 

findings. 

JUSTICE BREYER: How do we know that? Now --

now, what is the answer specifically in the statute?

Let's call it document 1 and document 2. And it really 

didn't help me that much in the briefs to see document 1 

continuously labeled with the word report when I thought 

that's the key question. Is it? Is it that report 

they're referring to? 

So now, go ahead. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Under rule 183(b) there is a 

report denominated as such. There's no question here it 

was submitted to the court. If you look at page 114a of 

the Kanter appendix, it says that the special trial judge 

submitted a report, as required by rule 183(b). And this 

case was then referred to Judge Dawson. He had no 

involvement with the case until this report was given to 

him. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Which --

MR. SHAPIRO: I'm sorry. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Which -- which brief --

MR. SHAPIRO: Oh. It's the petition for cert. 

The Kanter petition. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: At least --

JUSTICE SCALIA: What -- what page did you say? 

JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what page? 

MR. SHAPIRO: 114a, 114a. And throughout --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shapiro, why don't you 

simply read the text of 183(b) --

 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- which is in the 

Government's brief at 4a? It says, special trial judge's 

report. It is the only report to which the Tax Court 

rules refer.

 MR. SHAPIRO: That's correct, Your Honor. And 

it's --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And -- and if in fact --

MR. SHAPIRO: -- it is presumed correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- you rely on the rule, do we 

even have to resolve the issue of meaning of report in the 

statute? Can't we simply, from your position, rely on the 

rule and say you've got to follow your own rules?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely. This is a report that 

must be submitted. It is presumed correct under this 

rule. It's an independent evaluation of credibility from 

the only judge who heard the witnesses, and of course, 

it's part of the record. And it doesn't --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So you've really got three 

arguments. You've got the rule. You've got the statute, 

and you have due process. 

MR. SHAPIRO: And it doesn't make the slightest 

difference that the superior judge caused the subordinate 

judge to say, I have changed my mind at a later stage in 

the proceeding, because it is the original report that is

presumed correct under the rules. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, what -- what 

was the page? Please. You're going quite -- and I want 

to -- because Justice Ginsburg referred to a statement in 

the Government's brief that you said yes --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, not the Government's 

brief. The Tax Court rules. 

MR. SHAPIRO: That's -- that's appendix 4a. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: 4a of the Government's brief.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's the rule. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, it's the rule itself, 183(b).

 And it makes it clear that there must be a 

report filed with the chief judge. The docket here says 

that that was done. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Can you make the argument that 

-- maybe you can't -- that the special trial judge can go 

to the Tax Court judge, with the permission of the chief 

judge, and say, now, here's what -- kind of what I'm 

thinking? It's not my report, but here's what I'm 

thinking. And then the -- the Tax Court judge says, well, 

why don't you have some more findings on X and Y and Z? 

He says, okay, and then he goes back. Can you make the 

argument that that first document is not the report?

 MR. SHAPIRO: The first -- there is only one --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess another way of

saying it is, do the rules permit any consultation before 

the report is submitted? I -- I guess that's my question.

 MR. SHAPIRO: The rules are silent on that, but 

Judge Dawson has no involvement in the case until the 

report is submitted. Then the case is assigned to Judge 

Dawson, and then he is supposed to review it under a 

presumptive correctness standard. So it would be 

surprising if there were consultation of that sort.

 But what we contend is if there is consultation 

behind the scenes about credibility determinations, then 

it is critically important that the report be submitted 

and made part of the record and not concealed, and that 

the deferential standard of review be --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would -- would that problem 

be overcome if the special trial judge simply -- if his --

the proceedings before him were simply videotaped and then 

the reviewing judge, Judge Dawson in this case, could look 

at the trial proceedings and would have as much of a 

notion of the credibility of the witnesses as the special 

tax judge?

 MR. SHAPIRO: I suppose that's a possibility, 

but in Anderson, the Court said absent some procedure like 

that, the trial judge is uniquely situated to evaluate 

demeanor and tone of voice, and because of that, great 

deference has to be given to the independent evaluation of

the trial judge. Maybe in a -- in the future the Tax 

Court would want to use a procedure like that to mitigate 

the Raddatz problem that they now have. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: In which case, they -- they 

might well revise the language of their rule.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, they -- they might, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Which currently requires that 

the finding of facts of the trial judge be presumed to be 

correct.

 MR. SHAPIRO: That's correct, and after all, we 

should remember that the Government was supposed to 

present clear and convincing evidence of fraud in this 

case, and if there was a flip-flop of this sort going on 

behind the scenes, leaving no trace in the record, what 

could be more important to the reviewing court than to 

know what had occurred at the first stage and the second 

stage here? If the trial judge found no underpayment and 

no fraud, which we have reason to believe he did -- three 

Tax Court judges stated that to us -- if that was -- that 

was his finding and he found our witnesses to be credible, 

then an unexplained overturning of that credibility 

determination with no trace in the record would surely be 

a candidate for reversal on appeal. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Let -- let me ask this 

question, if I may. Suppose the -- a special trial judge

hears the witnesses, makes a report. It's assigned by the 

chief judge to a Tax Court judge, and the Tax Court judge 

looks it over it and says, you know, before I -- before I 

really spend a lot of time on this, you really didn't 

explore these three problems. Would you please do it over 

again? Is he permitted to do that or is that a violation 

of the rule that he shall presume the report to be 

correct?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, we haven't challenged the 

conversations as such. We think it is -- it is suspect, 

however. Under Raddatz, if somebody who has not heard the 

witnesses is telling somebody who has heard the witnesses, 

I don't agree or I think you may be wrong in your 

credibility determination, I'd like you to reconsider 

that, that's a serious Raddatz problem. And the only cure 

for that is to make the first report part of the record.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm asking if it's a violation 

of -- of the rule.

 MR. SHAPIRO: The --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because the -- the rule says a 

special report shall be presumed to be correct. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And if there's this initial 

review, he says, you know, I think it's really pretty 

incomplete until you do X, Y, Z, please do it over again,

is that a violation of the rule?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, I think the rule is silent 

on that, but the spirit of the rule, frankly, is that the 

STJ does his job. He completes his report. He submits 

it, and the reviewing judge examines it under a presumed-

correct standard in -- in the same orderly fashion that 

ordinarily occurs when there is an initial judgment from a 

-- from a trial judge about credibility with deferential 

review that comes later. 

But the rule doesn't tell us much about these 

consultations, and we do submit that if -- if they do take 

place, as the Government suggests, there's importuning and 

changing of minds going on through consultations, do this 

on record. Turn square corners because it would be quite 

important to the appellate court to know if there was a 

good reason for the overturning of these credibility 

determinations. 

And we -- we've seen that kind of review in the 

Stone case in the D.C. Circuit, which is very similar to 

this case. Factually the cases are quite similar. And 

the reviewing court, Judge Williams, found clear error 

based on what the rule 183 report stated about witness 

credibility. There was an elaborate explanation why 

particular witnesses were credible and incredible, and the 

court could use that to evaluate the judgment of the Tax

Court. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, what you're asking 

us to do would -- would just solve your problem in this 

case, and -- and in the future, I suppose they could 

revise rule 183 as simply not to require a report. There 

-- there's nothing in the statute that requires this 

report, is there?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, that's true. They could 

cease using the STJ's, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they could -- they could 

use them, but just say, instead of filing a report, he'll 

consult with the -- with the deciding judge.

 MR. SHAPIRO: I -- I suppose that could happen. 

If there is -- if there is no report written, we couldn't 

contend it has to be disclosed under these statutes, and 

that -- that might be. 

But it -- there could be a Raddatz issue in that 

scenario that you present, Justice Scalia. If one judge 

heard the witnesses and the other judge didn't hear the 

witnesses and -- and the -- the superior judge --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, they confer with each 

other. Maybe, maybe. 

MR. SHAPIRO: But it -- it would be -- it would 

be quite strange to have credibility determinations made 

by a judge who had never heard from any of the witnesses.

 JUSTICE BREYER: What happens in cases in 

agencies, you know, where -- where -- suppose the agency 

itself or a member thereof is going to make a decision, 

and there might be other members who would hear the 

witnesses. And I was thinking of that analogy. It's 

possible. It happens in the Federal Communications 

Commission where the staff, you know, consults back and 

forth in ratemaking cases. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: It's hard to find precisely the 

analogy, but it seems likely.

 MR. SHAPIRO: The -- the closest analogy in this 

Court's decisions is the Morgan II decision. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, which gives and takes 

away.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Now, Morgan II is really on point 

because there, a subordinate official drafted up findings, 

proposed findings, didn't serve them on the parties, but 

did give them to the decision-maker, the agency. And this 

Court held that was a violation of due process. 

JUSTICE BREYER: You have to have an opportunity 

to refute the information that's going to --

MR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes.

body that we know of in the Federal courts and in the 

State system too -- Chief Judge Vanderbilt pointed that out 

in the Mazza case. Every State in the Union requires 

disclosure of these administrative law decisions to the 

parties. 

JUSTICE BREYER: If you analogize the STJ to the 

administrative ALJ. But you might also analogize him to a 

member of the agency itself, and if you make that analogy, 

it doesn't become so far-fetched, particularly when you 

look at Morgan as also not allowing you to probe at what's 

going on.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes. Well, we -- we've avoided 

suggesting that any depositions should be taken of -- of 

judicial personnel here. That's not our view. Our view 

is simply that the report that was prepared -- it was 

prepared -- should be made part of the record by virtue of 

two statutes. There is an appellate review statute, 

Justice O'Connor, that states quite expressly that 

Congress expected review to take place here just as it 

does in the district court, to the same degree, to the 

same extent, and in the same manner. And in the district 

court, if an adjunct judge makes a finding of fact, 

whether it's a master or a magistrate or bankruptcy judge, 

that is always disclosed to the parties.

evidence in this record that the special trial judge in 

fact changed his report beyond the hearsay affidavit?

 MR. SHAPIRO: We don't know what is contained in 

that first report. We have heard from three of the 

judges, including the chief judge of the STJ's, that --

that what happened was that Judge Dawson rewrote the 

credibility findings. Now, we won't know until we see 

this. That could be wrong. But -- but it should be part 

of the record for the court of appeals. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Shapiro, on credibility, 

which you have been emphasizing, are you overstating the 

case for it? Because credibility is more than just 

observing the witnesses' demeanor. I mean, Judge Dawson 

could have said, yes, they -- these witnesses might have 

looked honest to the special trial judge, but considering 

this documentary evidence in the record, it's clear to me 

that what the witness said on the stand was a lie.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, you'll see in perhaps a 

dozen situations, he says, I simply don't believe that 

witness, none of whom he heard. And this is a case where 

credibility was key. Was there a bribery scheme of the 

kind that the IRS claimed? Every witness who testified 

said no, it didn't exist. These are simple investments 

with the proceeds being paid to the corporations, and yet, 

the Government's theory was there is some nefarious

bribery scheme that every witness denied. And there is no 

documentary evidence of that. The evidence of the 

proceeds flowing to these corporations was simply the 

result of their investing money in real estate deals. And 

so credibility was the key to this whole case.

 And the -- the Government, I don't think, can be 

serious when it tells this Court that this first report is 

some confidential document, that it's privileged internal 

deliberative material. For 40 years, the -- the Tax Court 

made these reports available to the public. It -- they 

were routinely served on the parties. For 40 years there 

was no suggestion --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would -- would you comment on 

that? I -- I understood from the brief there was a 

suggestion that if you prevail, we're going to have a huge 

volume of -- of printed material that we're not troubled 

with now.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes. That's a post hoc 

rationale. There was no such explanation when this rule 

was changed, and there's not a bit of work or a bit of 

expense resulting from our position. We simply ask for a 

copy of a report that exists. They can serve it on us 

electronically. It won't cost them a cent. We're making 

a very modest request under these statutes and under the 

Due Process Clause. And there was no explanation --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, now, wait. Under the Due 

Process Clause, I assume you would be asking for more than 

just access to the report. You -- if -- if you're really 

relying on Morgan II, he who hears must decide, I think 

you would be saying that after reading the report, you 

should have the opportunity to argue to the -- to Dawson 

here, to -- to the Tax Court judge that the report should 

not be adopted.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, we defer to --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't that part of your due 

process case?

 MR. SHAPIRO: It -- it really is not. We're 

asking --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You think it satisfies due 

process just to show you the report, and then --

MR. SHAPIRO: To give -- and make it part of the 

appellate record. We're not asking for any remand to the 

Tax Court. If the Tax Court doesn't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then -- then you're not 

relying on Morgan II. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, we -- we just rely on that 

as an example of the need to disclose this at an 

appropriate juncture. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: There wasn't a need to disclose 

the point that Morgan II made. It was he who hears must

decide. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, in Morgan II, the -- the 

point was that any -- any proposed findings that are 

drafted up have to be shared with the parties. Now, there 

they had to be shared with the parties at the 

administrative level. We're not going that far. If the 

Tax Court tells us that they don't want to have that layer 

of review within the Tax Court, they don't want to receive 

our comments on the initial report, that's fine with us. 

We want it to be made part of the appellate record so that 

the judges who are interested in this and believe it will 

shed a strong light on the issue of clear and convincing 

evidence can have this be part of the record. 

And already the Fifth Circuit has overturned the 

finding of fraud in this very same case. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do -- do I understand that 

you would be satisfied if the Court simply looked to --

what is it -- 7482(a)(1), the appellate review section, 

which says that the Tax Court decisions shall be reviewed 

in the same manner and to the same extent as district 

court decisions? And that --

MR. SHAPIRO: Yes. We'd be satisfied because 

that is a sufficient basis to say the record has to 

include the rule 183 report. And it is not up to the 

trial court to tell the appellate court what's in the

record on appeal. It's up to the appellate court to -- to 

determine what goes into that -- that record. This -- the 

case in the Second Circuit on that is IBM v. United States 

where the Second Circuit analyzed rule 10(a) and said it 

is not the province of the trial court to dictate to the 

reviewing court what is in that record.

 And this Court in --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And where is it? It's -- it 

is specified someplace, but when you review a district 

court decision in -- in a court of appeals, the --

certainly the magistrate's report would be included, but 

there's someplace where it lists the contents, some rule 

that lists --

MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes. It's rule 10(a) and it's 

-- it's very general. It says that all the original 

papers in the trial court come before the appellate court, 

and an original report is an original document submitted 

in the trial court. 

And this Court confronted that question in 

Universal Camera 50 years ago, and the Government made the 

same arguments then that it's making now and it lost 7 to 

2 in that case. It -- it said that the report --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Institutional memory. Isn't 

that -- that's a good institutional memory --

MR. SHAPIRO: It goes back.

 (Laughter.) 

MR. SHAPIRO: The same argument was made that 

the report is an irrelevance. It's just an aid to the 

decision-maker, and the decision-maker can do what it 

wants and has ultimate judgmental power. So there's no 

need to include that report in the record, and no weight 

should be given to it. 

This Court said, we will not adopt an 

exclusionary rule for the administrative law judge's 

report. And this is an a fortiori case because this 

report is presumed correct. In Universal Camera, there 

was no presumption of correctness at all. So that -- that 

case, you know, goes further than -- than what the Court 

has to do here. 

And the Government's argument that -- that 

somehow this is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that was decided under 

the APA, wasn't it? I mean, that was an APA case, which this 

isn't. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, yes, that's true. But, you 

know, the Court reached out to the APA for guidance in 

construing the labor laws. The labor laws were silent on 

this issue, but under the APA, the Court said the general 

policy is to disclose these reports and we are going to 

say that that is applicable to the NLRB.

 Now, the Government says all of this changes the 

course because the judge changed his mind, but you know, 

there are so many opinions and orders and reports in the 

Federal judicial system where a mind is changed and an 

opinion is suppressed or -- or vacated or replaced and 

that first opinion is still part of the record. It's a 

fallacy to say it's not part of the record just because 

it's been abandoned. 

For example, if I seek summary judgment in the 

district court and it's denied and then I ask for 

reconsideration and it's granted, the opinion has been 

abandoned, but it's still part of the record. And if I --

if an appeal is taken, it's going to be exhibit A in any 

appeal, and it may result in a reversal. 

Same thing when a case goes en banc. The panel 

opinion is vacated, but then when -- when cert is granted, 

the argument before this Court may convince this Court 

that the panel was right. Even though it's been 

abandoned, it's still very important. 

Or if a jury verdict is set aside -- the -- the 

district court says, judgment as a matter of law -- on 

appeal, the jury -- jury verdict may get sustained. So 

it's just a logical fallacy to say that because somebody 

has changed his mind, if that's what happened here, that 

-- that the first report drops out of the record.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would the -- the Tax Court 

rule -- now, this 183(c) -- says -- it describes the 

special trial judge's report, which is submitted to the 

chief judge, and then the chief judge assigns a Tax Court 

judge, and then it says that -- that the Tax Court judge 

may modify it, modify the special trial judge's report, or 

may reject it in whole or in part. Does the Tax Court 

ever modify a special trial judge's report? Does it ever 

reject it in whole or in part?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, yes, and -- and the remarkable 

thing is that every time it does that, it recites, we 

hereby adopt the findings and opinions of the trial judge. 

Now, in the old days, that was not a problem. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's one thing that 

they can do. They can adopt it, but my question is, do 

they always adopt and never use -- never use the term 

modify or reject?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, no. They -- they do modify 

and reject. It's just it's hard to determine, when they 

are doing that. In the old days --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They -- they never say so in 

their opinion. 

MR. SHAPIRO: They don't --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They always say that they adopt 

the trial judge's report. Don't they?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes. That's entirely correct. 

And now, in the old days, before they amended 

the rule, you could compare the two and see what was 

changed, but now you can't. You can't tell what has been 

changed. 

And in this instance, we believe there's been a 

complete rewrite of that first report, and the appellate 

courts can't tell what's going on. Was there a reason for 

doing this? Was deference given? Was some other agenda 

at work in this decision? No one can tell because it is 

all off the record. 

JUSTICE BREYER: What -- what is -- can I ask 

you a really esoteric administrative law question, which I 

have never been able to figure out? It's probably 

relevant, but I -- this is an agency. That's what -- my 

great tax professor, Ernie Brown, used to say there is no 

Tax Court. He says, the Board of Tax Appeals shall be 

known as the Tax Court. What he meant by that is it's not 

-- it isn't the Tax Court, just known as. So -- so this 

is an agency, an administrative agency. 

So I look to the APA for guidance, and the APA, 

when you look at the section, says this initial decision 

can be made by a 556-qualified person. Now, a 556-

qualified person can include the agency itself or a member 

of the agency or an ALJ.

 Then when you to look at what happens in 557, 

after that presiding employee makes an initial decision, 

it says you have to give a chance to the party to respond 

to the initial decision, which you like, in the case where 

the presiding employee -- presiding person is a 

subordinate employee. And so, that's what I was just 

checking here. 

And so -- so what's supposed to happen where the 

presiding person under 556 for that initial or tentative 

decision is not a subordinate employee, but rather, quote, 

one or more members of the body which comprise the agency? 

I've never run into that before. Maybe you haven't. 

Maybe they didn't mean anything by it, but maybe they did.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, I -- I haven't either. But 

the judge here certainly was subordinate and --

JUSTICE BREYER: He was a subordinate employee?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, he was. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Rather than a member -- is --

is -- if he's a subordinate employee, that's easy. Then 

the case is easy I think. 

MR. SHAPIRO: He -- he is a subordinate because 

as the Government keeps telling us, the Tax Court judge is 

the only official spokesman for the court. They get to 

make the final judgment. And the Tax Court judge reviews 

what the STJ has done.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't there an express 

exception for -- for --

MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, and this a court. This is an 

Article I court, this Court has held. And Congress has 

created very specific appellate review procedures for this 

court. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The -- the special trial 

judge has no tenure, does she?

 MR. SHAPIRO: That's correct. He -- those 

judges could be terminated at will, including because 

there is not sufficient work for the judge. They can be 

terminated on that basis. And that, we think, colors the 

analysis here for the reasons Judge Cudahy gave. 

This is not an independent judge. When he is 

persuaded by his superior to change his mind, it's obvious 

that he -- in our view, that he's going to be heavily 

influenced by that. It's a serious Raddatz problem. The 

only cure is to make this part of the record and to 

enforce the rule 183 presumption of correctness, which 

creates a clear error standard of review.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. HUNGAR: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court:

 The central flaw in petitioners' case is that 

both of the trial court judges responsible for evaluating 

the evidence in the record reached the same conclusion 

regarding all of the factual issues. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hungar, before you 

proceed to your legal argument, I was very curious why the 

Government is defending this practice because the 

Government, after all, is on the other side of every case. 

And aren't there situations where it might be that the 

special trial judge would call a credibility question in 

the Government's favor and then the Government loses the 

case before the Tax Court judge and might like to know, 

before it goes to the court of appeals, how solid the 

credibility findings were? I mean, I -- I -- the 

Government being a party to all these proceedings, why is 

it satisfied with not knowing what the report of the 

special tax judge -- special trial judge was?

 MR. HUNGAR: Justice Ginsburg, we do know what 

the report of the special trial judge was. It is in the 

record. Judge Couvillion's name is on his report.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, it is not the report. It 

is called an opinion. It isn't even called the report, 

and if you will read 183(b), that describes the report. 

Does anything else describe the report? And what is this 

report? There is a report. It is submitted to the chief 

judge. What would you call that? 

MR. HUNGAR: The report is the -- contains the 

recommended findings of fact and opinion, analysis of the 

law and application of the law to the fact, of the special 

trial judge. The report is the findings of fact plus, 

quote, the opinion. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now, what is the 183(b) 

report?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There --

MR. HUNGAR: The -- under rule 183(b), the --

the special trial judge submits his report to the chief 

judge. It is then referred to a Tax Court judge. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So that report, the special 

trial judge's report, is a document prepared by the 

special trial judge which he gives to the chief judge.

 MR. HUNGAR: Correct. But the important thing

to understand, Your Honor, is that nothing in the rule 

precludes, during the course of the deliberative process 

that then follows, the special trial judge from concluding 

that he has made a mistake, that he no longer agrees with 

the -- the stated findings of fact in that -- in that 

original report, from withdrawing and submitting a 

corrected report. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But that's not the way the rule 

reads. The rule reads, as I understand it, under (c) that 

the court itself may accept, reject, or modify. It 

doesn't say anything about the special trial judge 

reconsidering and rewriting his report.

 MR. HUNGAR: It doesn't preclude it either, Your 

Honor. There's a longstanding practice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes, it does because it -- it 

goes on to say that due regard shall be given to the 

circumstance that the special trial judge had the 

opportunity to evaluate and the findings of fact 

recommended by the special trial judge shall be presumed 

to be correct. But if those findings of fact are simply 

the same findings of fact that he agrees with the rest of 

the -- the panel on, it just makes no sense at all. 

MR. HUNGAR: The Tax Court judge cannot report 

in -- in the opinion that is issued by the Tax Court, he 

cannot say I'm adopting the opinion and findings of the

because the Tax Court has determined that it will not be

says that the reports have to be made public.

MR. HUNGAR: Well, Justice Kennedy, if I may, 

I'd like first to finish my response to Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Sure. 

MR. HUNGAR: The statutes -- the -- the 

disclosure requirement applies only to reports of the Tax 

Court. It is perfectly clear that a report, the original 

report, or any report of a special trial judge is not and 

cannot be the report of the Tax Court unless it is first 

adopted and approved by a Tax Court judge, and then goes 

through the next step of -- of being submitted --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, it's -- it's very hard 

to understand how appellate review can function if that 

first report of the special trial judge is never 

disclosed. I just don't see how the appellate review can 

function properly. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And how do we know that it was

is no evidentiary or probative value in an initial 

conclusion that the -- that the person who reached that 

conclusion has abandoned, has concluded was wrong. 

Special Trial Judge --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, the rule --

MR. HUNGAR: -- Couvillion rejected --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: -- the rule -- the rule 183 

does provide for a certain degree of deference to be given 

to those findings of the special trial judge.

 MR. HUNGAR: To the recommended findings of the 

special trial judge. And I submit that if the special 

trial judge has concluded that his initial recommendations 

were mistaken because, based upon further consideration as 

a judicial officer in the exercise of his obligations, he 

has realized he made a mistake, I submit it would be 

bizarre to require a Tax Court judge to give some sort of 

-- of deference to --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Hungar, do you --

MR. HUNGAR: -- abandoned findings. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you see somewhat of a 

problem, that we are not dealing here with the 

relationship between peers? Judge Dawson is appointed, 

what, for a 15-year term. The special trial judge is 

appointed by the Tax Court and his job is at the Tax 

Court's grace. And if you have compared in your brief 

that relationship to, say, a discussion among colleagues, 

I think it's worlds different. 

MR. HUNGAR: Justice Ginsburg, Judge Dawson 

actually is a senior judge who was recalled. So he 

doesn't have the 15-year term protection. 

But it's true that special trial judges are --

are appointed by the chief judge, not by the Tax Court 

judges, but by the chief judge, so that Judge Dawson 

wasn't, in a sense, his -- his appointing, employing 

official. 

But more to the point, special --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: He has had a special -- a --

a long term and he is well-known and respected as a Tax 

Court judge who was appointed, as all other members of the 

court were appointed. 

MR. HUNGAR: Well, Judge Couvillion has been a 

special trial judge, I think, for nearly 20 years.

 But the point is special trial judges are bound 

by the code of conduct. The Tax Court has adopted for 

both Tax Court judges and special trial judges the same 

code of conduct that applies to Federal judges under 

Article III, which --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It seems to me --

MR. HUNGAR: -- obligates independent decision-

making. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It seems to me that it's very 

much like, if you have to compare it with something, the 

relationship between a magistrate and a Federal district 

court judge. The magistrate also hears testimony, makes a 

report, findings, and a recommendation. What's the 

difference between those two?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, one difference is that the 

district court judges, as I understand it, appoint the 

magistrate, not the chief judge. 

But a more significant difference is that the 

statute and rules applicable to magistrates require 

disclosure of their reports and do not treat them as part 

of the internal deliberative process. The Tax Court has 

determined that it is inefficient to have disclosure of 

the original report, then have exceptions and have that 

whole process followed that they used to follow. They 

have determined that they will treat the Tax Court --

excuse me -- the special trial judge's report --

JUSTICE BREYER: So where does it say that? 

Where does it say that?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: They're not requiring the --

this case doesn't involve the question of whether they can 

make objections to the finding in -- in the special 

report. It's just whether it's disclosed.

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. But the -- but 

the Tax Court has determined not to disclose it. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I understand. But your 

argument about how it would make the proceeding more 

cumbersome, it seems to me, is -- is misplaced.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, it certainly would be more 

cumbersome if they followed the procedure that they used 

to follow, which we submit, although the record is -- they 

did not specifically state --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But they're not asking for 

that. Am -- am I wrong on --

MR. HUNGAR: Yes, that's true, Your Honor. What 

they're asking for here, what they say they want is merely 

disclosure of the original report. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And it's a particularly strong 

argument in a case -- in several of the issues. I 

remember Judge Fromm's opinion turned on the credibility 

of oral testimony, and in one case, Judge Fromm found the

-- the judge here made an erroneous ruling on credibility 

on one issue, if I remember correctly. And it seems to me 

that's a case in which it would be particularly relevant 

to know the reasons pro and con on why credibility 

determinations were made by the person who heard the 

witnesses. 

MR. HUNGAR: But the person who heard the 

witnesses is Special Trial Judge Couvillion. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Has been convinced that he was 

wrong. 

MR. HUNGAR: Yes. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And the question is, well, 

what was his -- what was the basis for his original 

position when you're evaluating whether you've got a valid 

argument to make on appeal? 

MR. HUNGAR: Under that rationale, Justice 

Stevens, every time a district court judge changes his 

mind, after giving further thought to a case --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, no, no. 

MR. HUNGAR: -- before he issues his final 

opinion --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Only if he is required by a 

rule to make certain findings and to deliver a completed 

report to someone else.

not preclude the practice. It is a common practice --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It doesn't forbid it. You're 

right. It doesn't forbid it in so many words. But I just 

wonder, does it comport with your normal notions of a fair 

way to conduct a fair hearing, letting the parties know 

what the basis for decision was and who thought what about 

the witnesses and so forth?

 MR. HUNGAR: Absolutely, Your Honor. If the --

in a -- when a -- when a court has a collegial 

deliberative process involving more than one person that 

is involved in the decision-making -- certainly this is an 

unusual process in that -- and there is no identical 

analog, but we see no due process problem. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No. But I don't see what is 

consistent with your notion of a deliberative process as 

producing the report and the presumption of correctness in 

the rule. The rule presumes that some original document, 

which you are treating as provisional, enjoys a 

presumption of correctness, and I don't see the 

consistency between provisionality and deliberate 

character on the one hand and presumption on the other.

 MR. HUNGAR: If I may, Your Honor, the rule does 

not state that the, quote, original report shall receive a 

presumption of correctness. It doesn't even say that --

that any report shall receive a presumption of

correctness. It says the findings of fact recommended by 

the special trial judge. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: And aren't those findings of 

fact the findings of fact that are delivered to the chief 

judge in the report that is made to the chief judge before 

it is even assigned to a Tax Court judge?

 MR. HUNGAR: Not if -- not if the tax -- if the 

special trial judge has abandoned those recommendations, 

withdrawn those recommendations, and replaced them.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But he hasn't abandoned them at 

the point that he delivers them to the chief judge, and if 

that's what this is referring to, then the presumption of 

the -- of -- of correctness necessarily has to apply to 

whatever the document is that's delivered to the chief 

judge. 

MR. HUNGAR: Well, it applies to the report, but 

I submit that if the special trial judge withdraws in 

order to correct an error in the report, what he submits 

as the corrected report is then the, quote, report. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You're -- you're --

subsequent. It seems to me that you're saying, Mr. 

Hungar, that the last sentence of 183 is unenforceable.

 MR. HUNGAR: The -- the credibility -- the due 

regard and presumption of --

JUSTICE SOUTER: The presumption. 

MR. HUNGAR: Well, it's important to understand 

also that, in fact, it would violate the Internal Revenue 

Code. This rule must be construed to be consistent with 

the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code 

makes very clear, and this Court held in Freytag, that the 

Tax Court judge, not the special trial judge, is the 

decision-maker, the only finder of fact in these kinds of 

cases under subsection (b)(4) of the statute. This Court 

so held in Freytag and the -- and the statute makes that 

very clear. So it would violate the statute to construe 

this, as petitioners do, to require some sort of 

deferential clear error review. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying the rule 

itself in that respect is invalid?

 MR. HUNGAR: If construed as petitioners would 

have it, yes. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, how else could you 

possibly construe it? There's no presumption operating at 

all on your reading. 

MR. HUNGAR: In the tax context, Your Honor, the 

-- there is a presumption of correctness that attaches to 

assessments and deficiency notices issued by --

 JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but you're saying there is 

-- there is no presumption of correctness that can operate 

with respect to the report that goes first to the chief 

judge because, I understood you to say, to do that would 

violate the Internal Revenue Code provision that the fact-

finder and the only fact-finder is the Tax Court judge. 

And therefore, I think the implication of what you're 

saying is that the rule on its face is invalid.

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, presumption of 

correctness does not necessarily equate with clear error, 

deferential review. That's my point. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: I'm -- I'm not even getting to 

whatever the standard of review may be. I presume the 

word presumption means something other than it's there 

unless you want to change it later after the person who 

employs you objects to it. It's got to mean something 

more than that.

 MR. HUNGAR: What the presumption of correctness 

means in the tax context, with respect to deficiency 

determinations and the like, is that the burden of going 

forward is on the party seeking to change what -- what --

the determination that is presumed correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: But there's no party who is 

seeking to change at this point because the parties don't 

know what's in it. They're not going forward. This is,

as you point out, an internal process that is going on 

here. So that definition can't apply. 

MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. If -- there --

there are two processes that go on. The Tax Court judge, 

quite appropriately, we -- we assume and have -- have no 

reason to disagree, confers with, discusses with the 

special trial judge. If -- if in the course of that 

discussion, one or both of them come to the conclusion 

that something is wrong in the original report and if the 

special trial judge agrees, the special trial judge has 

the option of withdrawing his original report, submitting 

a corrected report, and having the presumption of 

correctness, whatever it means, apply to his corrected 

report. If -- if --

JUSTICE SCALIA: In -- in that discussion, does 

the Tax Court judge have to give great weight to the 

findings of fact of the -- of the special judge?

 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, not great weight 

because, again, that would violate the statute. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Any weight? 

MR. HUNGAR: He is to give due -- the due regard 

provision we think is essentially precatory, as the -- as 

the Seventh Circuit said. It reminds the -- the Tax Court 

judge that he should not lightly set aside the credibility 

determinations. But again, that's not what happened here.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So I -- I think your -- I think 

your answer then is not that this is invalid. It is 

simply unenforceable. It is precatory language, looks 

okay, but there's no way to police it. 

MR. HUNGAR: It's certainly not enforceable in 

an appellate court. That's correct. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Judicially it cannot be 

enforced. 

MR. HUNGAR: That's correct, because otherwise 

it would violate the statute if it imposed some meaningful 

limitation. 

But again, it's important to understand here the 

Tax Court judge did not exercise his authority in this 

case to reverse or set aside the special trial judge's 

findings. He could have done so --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do they -- do they ever? I 

mean, this -- this says, this decision -- it's labeled --

the -- the court agrees with and adopts the opinion of the 

special trial judge. Are there Tax Court cases where the 

Tax Court says, instead of that, the court modifies the 

decision of the special trial judge or the court rejects, 

in whole or in part, the report of the special trial 

judge? 

MR. HUNGAR: We cite --

out that way?

 MR. HUNGAR: We cite in footnote 4 a small 

number of cases from prior to the last rule change in 

which that occurred. In addition, there are at least a 

couple of cases since the rule change in which the Tax 

Court judge rejected parts of the opinion, but not the 

findings. We're not aware of any cases in which the Tax 

Court judge has rejected the findings, but there are other 

cases -- Little against Commissioner, 103 T.C. 285; Walker 

against Commissioner, 101 T.C. 537 -- in which the Tax 

Court judge expressed a disagreement with a portion of the 

opinion of the special trial judge and then proceeded to 

decide the case in the manner he or she thought --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because if one were just to 

rule this -- read this rule straight: first, the report 

that goes to the chief judge, and then it says that the 

Tax Court judge may modify it, reject it in whole --

adopt, modify, or reject in whole or in part. You would 

expect, if we were having truth in labeling, that 

whenever, with consultation, without, there's a difference 

between the two documents, the Tax Court judge, in 

combination with the special trial judge or without, would 

say, action on the report -- action on the report, which 

is the special trial judge's report, is it is modified or 

it is rejected or it is rejected in part. I mean --

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, again, that assumes that the 

-- that the -- the rule compels the interpretation that 

the special trial judge is prohibited from withdrawing, 

correcting, and resubmitting his report. I submit it does 

not compel that interpretation, and the Tax Court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The rule -- the rule doesn't 

say anything about this consultation that you've 

described. And if that's the Tax Court's procedure, why 

isn't it laid out in the rules so everyone can see it 

instead of being deceived by reading here is the special 

trial judge's report, and now what the Tax Court will do 

is either adopt, modify, or reject in whole or in part?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, I don't think it -- I mean, I 

don't think it's -- it's deceitful, the -- the possibility 

that a court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Misleading. Because when I 

just read this rule cold, that's what I assumed, that we 

have the initial report and then it goes to the Tax Court 

judge, and that judge does something with it, and that 

something may be adopt, it may be modify, it may be reject 

in whole or in part. 

MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, when the Tax Court 

adopted its present procedures in 1984, it -- it certainly 

did not do so in as artful a manner as it could have. But 

the question is whether it violates the statute or due

process for it to do what it has done. 

Let me just -- we've been spending most of our 

time talking about this issue of whether the Tax Court --

the special trial judge is permitted to change his report 

under rule 183. That's not even one of the questions in 

the questions presented. The only rule 183 question in 

the questions presented is whether the rule requires clear 

error review. We submit the answer to that is no because 

it would violate the Internal Revenue Code. So this --

this question about whether the report permits -- whether 

the rule permits the report to be changed isn't even one 

of the questions presented. 

The courts of appeals upheld the judgment on the 

premise that it was permissible for the Tax Court judge 

and the trial -- the special trial judge to engage in the 

deliberative process and for the special trial judge to 

revise his findings as he did --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I don't think there's any --

any question they can change the report, but the one --

the one -- I'd like to ask you a question as a matter of 

information. The first sentence of 183(c) refers to the 

possibility that the judge to whom the case is assigned 

may direct the filing of additional briefs to receive 

further evidence and oral argument. Does it ever happen 

that before the judge to whom it's assigned decides

whether or not to go along with the recommended findings, 

that he will direct oral argument? Does that ever happen?

 MR. HUNGAR: I don't know the answer to that, 

Your Honor. I'm not aware of that, but --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Because if he did, it would 

seem almost necessary for him to disclose to the parties 

what the report they're arguing about would say.

 MR. HUNGAR: Again, I -- this is a holdover from 

the prior version of the rule in which the exceptions 

process was followed, and again, it may be that had the 

Tax Court given it further consideration, they might have 

viewed that unnecessary. But we're not aware of that 

happening. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it certainly seems to 

contemplate deliberation by the judge to whom the case is 

assigned about whether or not to accept the report and 

deliberation which might be informed from input -- input 

from the parties. That's a fair reading of the rule, I 

think. 

MR. HUNGAR: If --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe it's not practiced.

 MR. HUNGAR: -- if the Tax Court judge so 

determines, yes. The rule certainly allows that, but it 

doesn't obviously require that. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And if he did then ask for

further briefings, do you think that there would then have 

been a requirement to disclose the report?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, presumably it would be a 

waste of everyone's time unless he -- I don't know that he 

would have to disclose the report, but he would need to 

direct their attention to the issue he would like them to 

brief. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that the author 

of this subsection (c) must have contemplated the 

possibility of disclosure of the report.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, again, Your Honor, this 

language was adopted at a time when they followed the 

exception --

JUSTICE STEVENS: When they followed a different 

procedure, and the question is to how much -- how much did 

they intend the -- to change that prior procedure.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, we know that the Tax Court 

has interpreted its rule to permit precisely the practice 

it followed here because it said so. And it would be 

quite extraordinary, we submit, for this Court to reverse 

the Tax Court, which is surely entitled to considerable 

deference in interpreting its own rules, since, after all, 

the Tax Court has exclusive statutory authority to 

promulgate its own rules, and particularly with respect to 

this issue about whether the special trial judge can

change his report, since that was not even one of the 

questions presented. 

If I may turn to -- back to the statutory 

question. Section 7461 requires disclosure of reports of 

the Tax Court. The special trial judge report is not the 

report of the Tax Court. Indeed, even a Tax Court judge's 

opinion and report does not become the report of the Tax 

Court. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does the statute you just 

quoted prohibit the disclosure of other reports if we call 

this first draft something other than a report?

 MR. HUNGAR: The statute doesn't --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In other words, would -- would 

the rule go further than the statute?

 MR. HUNGAR: The statute does not prohibit the 

disclosure of other reports, but the rule clearly does not 

require the disclosure of reports. The Tax Court in 1984 

amended the rule to make perfectly clear that -- that 

initial reports of special trial judges are not to be 

disclosed. The Tax Court said in its orders in this case 

the reason for that is that those are now internal 

deliberative processes. The Tax Court has made clear that 

its rules permit exactly what it's doing here. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hungar, you started to say 

that -- that even the opinion of a -- of a Tax Court judge

is not a report of the Tax Court.

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: How does that work?

 MR. HUNGAR: Page 2a of the appendix to the gray 

brief, at the bottom of the page, section 7460(b) provides 

that the report of the division -- and the Tax Court is 

now and has for many years been divided into one-judge 

divisions. They used to sit en banc or --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I was -- I was going to ask you 

what -- what 7461 referred to when it says the Tax Court 

and its divisions. 

MR. HUNGAR: Yes. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It also is referred to there.

 MR. HUNGAR: For a brief period of time, they 

sat in -- in panels. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. 

MR. HUNGAR: But they -- the -- the press of 

work force them to -- to divide into one-judge divisions. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: So it's a single judge is a 

division of the Tax Court. 

MR. HUNGAR: Yes, that's correct. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: And the publicity of 

proceedings does say -- it does say that all reports of 

the Tax Court --

MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: And all evidence received by 

the Tax Court and its divisions, meaning its single 

judges. 

Well, what happens with -- with a single judge's 

opinion? 

MR. HUNGAR: He -- he prepares it and submits it 

to the chief judge under rule -- under statute -- under 

the statute 7460(b) where it says the report of the 

division shall become the report of the Tax Court within 

30 days after such report by the division, unless the 

chief judge directs it to be reviewed by the full court. 

So -- so even a Tax Court judge's opinion is not the 

report of the Tax Court. Surely the report of the special 

trial judge is not either. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's like an en banc. I -- I 

have written decisions for a panel in my years on the 

court of appeals, and there's been an en banc and my 

opinion gets vacated. It's no longer counts for anything. 

And isn't that exactly what the Tax Court is? They have 

the --

MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. The -- the opinion 

is not made public. In fact, the statute precludes it 

from being made -- made a part of the record. The last 

sentence of that same section 7460(b) at the top of page 

3a, it says the report of a division shall not be a part

of the record in any case in which the chief judge directs 

that such report shall be reviewed by the Tax Court. And 

that's a very important point. Congress has mandated by 

statute essentially the same procedure that the Tax Court 

follows here. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Oh, no. No, no, no. How 

often, when there is a decision reviewed by the court, so 

that the initial judge's decision is changed, does that 

judge dissent, so all the world knows what that judge's 

initial position was?

 MR. HUNGAR: The -- the Tax Court judge 

certainly has the authority to dissent, just as a special 

trial judge has the authority and, indeed, the obligation 

under the code of conduct to refuse to put his name on a 

-- on a report if he doesn't agree with it. If he doesn't 

agree with the Tax Court judge's view, he has the 

obligation, the ethical obligation -- and we presume he 

follows it -- to say I don't agree. This is my report. 

If you --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then he -- then he can 

publish his -- he can publish his dissent, just as a Tax 

Court judge can?

 MR. HUNGAR: No, but he can preclude the Tax 

Court judge from doing what the Tax Court judge did in 

this case, which is simply adopting his report. If the --

if the special trial judge refuses to change his report --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then we still won't know 

what his report is. Yes, he can say, I won't sign this. 

Tax Court says, fine. This rule says I can reject your 

findings in whole or in part. I don't need your name on 

this decision of the Tax Court. 

MR. HUNGAR: Justice Ginsburg, if -- if that 

were the case here, obviously our arguments would be more 

difficult. But that is not what happened here. If --

if --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking you just as the --

the judge who disagrees with the -- the full court can 

publish his dissent, can the special trial judge who 

disagrees with the Tax Court judge publish his dissent?

 MR. HUNGAR: In the -- the one case involving a 

change in the opinion, where the Tax Court judge said, I 

don't adopt a portion of the opinion of the special trial 

judge, there was no published opinion of the special trial 

judge. So I don't believe there's a procedure for the 

dissent. 

But the point is the court of appeals --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Has there ever been? Has 

there ever been? 

MR. HUNGAR: A published dissent by a special 

trial judge? Not that I'm aware of.

 But the point is the court of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And how -- how often does the 

-- is there a dissent when there's -- when there's a full 

court review decision? 

MR. HUNGAR: Well, there's often a dissent. 

It's -- it's hard to know from the standpoint of a 

researcher when -- when it is that the judge who heard the 

evidence and tried the case is the one who's dissenting, 

unless they happen to say it in their opinion, because 

again, there's no original opinion issued by the Tax Court 

judge who first heard the case. That's kept confidential 

by statute, which again is an important point. 

Congress has mandated confidentiality of the 

initial reports prepared even by Tax Court judges, and it 

has given the Tax Court plenary authority to promulgate 

rules governing special trial judges. It is hardly 

surprising, let alone impermissible under the statute or 

Due Process Clause, for the Tax Court to follow a similar 

process for special trial judges. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Except that the -- the 

relationship between the -- the one judge and the full Tax 

Court is a relationship basically of people who are in the 

same boat with respect to what they know about or can know 

about law and what they can know about the evidence and 

the facts of the case; whereas the relationship between

the special trial judge and the judge to whom it is 

assigned is -- is quite different because only one of them 

has heard evidence and only one of them is the source of 

conclusion about fact. 

MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. It's identical. 

The -- the full Tax Court --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It certainly is not identical 

in -- in the sense that the -- the Tax Court judge then 

goes and listens to evidence. He doesn't. That's the 

whole point.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, neither does the full Tax 

Court when it --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Neither does the full Tax 

Court, but if the full Tax Court is disagreeing with one 

judge, the one judge and the full Tax Court are in the 

same boat. They have access to the same material. Their 

limits are exactly the same in each case. That is not 

true in the relationship between the single Tax Court 

judge and the special Tax Court judge. The special Tax 

Court judge is the only one who has heard evidence and can 

find facts based upon the evidence that he heard. 

MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. The -- the tax --

the full Tax Court doesn't go back and -- and hold a new 

trial, just like the individual Tax Court judges --

JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I am quite aware of that.

That's not -- that's not the point. I'm -- I'm saying 

that you cannot draw an analogy between one judge and full 

Tax Court and use that as an analogy to legitimize the 

relationship between one judge and a trial master. They 

are in different positions. They are not in parallel 

positions. 

MR. HUNGAR: Well, then if -- if I understand 

the point you're making, it's a point of the -- the --

it's the hierarchy issue, if that's -- if that's the point 

you're making. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: It's the knowledge issue. The 

special Tax Court judge heard somebody. 

MR. HUNGAR: So did the Tax Court judge --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Nobody on the Tax Court did.

 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. That's incorrect.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: In other words, they're --

they're sitting hearing witnesses? They are -- they are 

redoing the trial? Surely not. 

MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, in a review -- if a Tax 

Court judge -- most Tax Court cases are tried by Tax Court 

judges. Tax Court judges are trial judges, and if a Tax 

Court judge tries a case --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But we are talking about 

situations in which the trial judge is the special judge.

Tax Court, Your Honor. If the full Tax Court reviews an 

individual Tax Court judge's decision, the Tax Court judge 

has presided over the trial, heard the evidence, just like 

the special trial judge here, and then the full Tax Court 

judge reviews it. 

That's exactly what happened in the Estate of 

Varian case, which is in our briefs, out of the Ninth 

Circuit. The parties complained that they wanted access 

to the original judge's report because he had been 

reversed -- been reversed by the full court after trial on 

an -- on an evidentiary issue, and the Ninth Circuit said 

no. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Hungar, I think we 

understand your answer. 

MR. HUNGAR: Thank you.

minutes left. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN M. SHAPIRO

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. SHAPIRO: The question came up whether rule 

183 forbids disclosure of this report. The answer is it 

does not forbid disclosure of the report. It is silent on 

the point. But the press release the Tax Court issued in 

1983, coming from the chief judge of the court, said that 

this simply meant that it would not automatically be

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why does 7461 require its --

its disclosure? Because it does say that the -- it's only 

the decision of the Tax Court. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That reports of the Tax Court 

that have to be disclosed. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Our view is that of -- of the Tax 

Court means any report emanating from the Tax Court. 

That's the literal meaning of that language. It doesn't 

mean final.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that -- that would mean 

that -- that you would have to make public the -- the 

reports of a regular Tax Court judge in cases that then go 

on to the full court. And that's not done, is it?

 MR. SHAPIRO: There's an exception for the en 

banc situation because legal issues are addressed en banc, 

not the factual issues. And there's an opportunity to 

dissent.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but it doesn't matter. 

It would still be a report of the Tax Court if you don't 

take that language literally. If you say any report 

coming out of the institution is a report of the Tax 

Court, you would have to make public the reports of the 

individual Tax Court judges, which is not done.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Oh, we say there's a special 

statute dealing with the en banc situation that -- that 

governs in that situation. And that the publicity --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Why is that? What -- what 

statute is that? 

MR. SHAPIRO: That -- that's the en banc 

provision that counsel referred to that said that when the 

case is heard en banc, the trial -- the -- the single 

judge's report is not made part of the record. Congress' 

assumption there was that there would be a new -- new 

report issued. People would be able to dissent if they 

disagreed. And this process focuses on legal issues. 

There is no presumption of correctness. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's not a -- that's not a 

de novo -- they can rehear matters de novo on the en banc 

Tax Court, can they not? That's a de novo hearing.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, but it addresses legal 

issues. It's not a device to second guess factual 

determinations, and there's a special statute that deals 

with that, which does not apply to this STJ situation, 

where there's a presumption of correctness applicable to 

what the trial judge does. And there is the general 

disclosure statute that applies there. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't know if I'm getting --

so that's his basic point. The rule doesn't require the

disclosure because they've interpreted it differently 

within their -- within their discretion. Statute 

doesn't require it and the Constitution doesn't require 

it. We have to go to the Constitution, I don't see 

exactly the implications. So I'm nervous. 

And now, the reports -- he says, go read 

7460(b). That's what they're talking about. And then --

and again, I don't know what I'm getting into once I read 

it more broadly than that. And what about all evidence 

received by the Tax Court, including a transcript. Of 

course, this isn't evidence but neither is a transcript. 

And -- and so maybe that word evidence can be read more 

broadly, given the fact that it's to include a transcript 

of the stenographic report. 

MR. SHAPIRO: I think you're right, and --

JUSTICE BREYER: You think I'm right just 

suddenly for the for the first time? You have thought of 

this?

 MR. SHAPIRO: Well, I -- I think that the intent 

of this provision -- and I know Your Honor consults the 

legislative history. The intent was to make all of the 

steps in the adjudicative process transparent, including 

the evidence, including the -- the stenographer's report, 

and all reports from the Tax Court.

careful use of language. It says all reports of the Tax 

Court and all evidence received by the Tax Court and its 

divisions. So it's only the evidence that -- that's 

received by the individual judges has to be made public, 

not the reports. 

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, we believe that the word all 

is a broad, generic inclusive term that should be applied, 

as Judge Cudahy stated, to an STJ report that actually has 

to be submitted to the chief judge and that has legal 

effect. It's not just a casual document like a law clerk 

memorandum. It has legally operative effect.

 Congress' purpose here was very broad, to have 

transparency, applicable to all the steps along the way in 

the Tax Court. It was quite clear on that, that there are 

arbitrary actions at each step of the way. If you look at 

the Senate report and Congressman LaGuardia's statements, 

they said secrecy is a vicious practice in this context, 

and it -- it should be avoided.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we -- we don't have to 

get into any of that if we accept your argument about 

7482(a)(1), that is, the record will be in the same manner 

and to the same extent as decisions of the district court.

 MR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely, Your Honor. There --

there are three separate bases for ruling in our favor. 

One is the appellate review statute. The other is the

disclosure statute. The third is due process. And due

This Court tries to avoid serious due process issues 

through its interpretation of legislation. Judge Cudahy 

suggested that was the right way to decide this case and 

we agree that it is. 

We thank the Court.
