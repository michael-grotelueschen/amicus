 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 07-1356, Kansas v. Ventris.

 General McAllister.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. McALLISTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 The Court has always held that the 

defendant's voluntary statements obtained in violation 

of constitutional standards may be used for impeachment 

purposes when the defendant testifies at trial.

 The Court has excluded statements for all 

purposes only when they are involuntary or have been 

compelled. The question in this case is whether 

voluntary statements obtained in violation of the rule 

of Massiah v. United States should be treated 

differently than all other voluntary statements.

 The answer is "no" for at least three 

reasons. First, permitting the impeachment use of 

voluntary statements obtained in violation of 

constitutional standards is necessary to prevent perjury 

by criminal defendants.

 Second, in terms of the effect at trial,

there is no basis for distinguishing a voluntary 

statement obtained in violation of the Massiah rule from 

Fourth Amendment violations, Miranda violations, or 

violations of the rule of Michigan v. Jackson.

 In all of those situations the resulting 

evidence may limit defense counsel's options at trial, 

but there is no basis in that respect for distinguishing 

a Massiah violation.  It has no different effect than 

those others. Also, the Sixth Amendment right to 

counsel does not include a right to commit perjury or to 

have the assistance of counsel in presenting false 

testimony.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: When does -- when does the 

Sixth Amendment violation occur?

 MR. McALLISTER: That question, Your Honor, 

as you realize, is debated a bit in the briefs, it's --

Kansas for purposes of deciding this case, is willing to 

accept the position of the United States and the 

Respondent that it occurs when the statement is admitted 

at trial, although the cases have not necessarily 

definitively resolved that question. We, frankly, think 

it is unnecessary to answer the question, because it's a 

minimal point in terms of potential deterrence --

deterrence that operate in this segment --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you -- do we have any

other situation in which, for purposes of impeaching 

testimony, a constitutional violation results?

 MR. McALLISTER: Well, that's the -- that is 

one of the intricacies of this particular question, 

although arguably in the Fifth Amendment context 

certainly the Miranda warnings are given. The police 

don't do that. And if that is the completion of the 

violation, it's analogous in many ways, if one looks 

back at the cases.

 The Court has suggested that the actual 

violation is the use of the statement at trial against 

the defendant, not simply obtaining it without the 

necessary warnings being given. So we would argue that 

is, in fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's parallel to the Fifth.

 MR. McALLISTER: It's parallel to the Fifth 

in this respect, and certainly, it's distinct from the 

Fourth in that respect. But we don't think it matters 

at the end of the day. If one were to treat it like the 

Fourth Amendment, so that the violation is complete when 

the police send in an informant and he works hard to 

elicit statements in violation of the Messiah law, if 

it's complete at that time, then all of the analysis 

from the Fourth Amendment cases is equally applicable 

here.

If the violation does not occur until it's 

presented at trial, then it's analogous more to the 

Fifth Amendment and also to the Michigan v. Jackson and 

Michigan v. Harvey cases, which were Sixth Amendment 

right to counsel violations, in which case the Court 

said it was wrong for the police to initiate 

interrogation after he invoked his right but will let 

the statement be admitted for impeachment purposes. So 

it is exactly analogous to what the Court did in Harvey 

itself.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would it make no 

difference, I take it, General McAllister, if this had 

been a police officer who was pretending to be a 

cellmate? In this case it was a snitch, but it could be 

a police officer doing inside the cell what he couldn't 

do outside; that is, the police officer outside wants to 

interrogate, must inform the arrestee of his Miranda 

rights, but inside the cell, the police could pretend to 

be a jailbird and they can get the information that way. 

Is that --

MR. McALLISTER: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

believe that is correct if -- if it's for example, an 

undercover officer, someone has gone in -- in fact, 

there are cases such as Weatherford v. Bursey that 

involved an undercover agent who was present for

meetings with the defendant and his counsel, and the 

Court indicated that the presence alone would not 

violate the right to counsel. It's the deliberate 

solicitation and use of statements obtained from the 

defendant that would violate the Sixth Amendment.

 So if a cellmate, another defendant, is the 

informant who listens and hears, it wouldn't make any 

difference under the Court's cases if, in fact, it was a 

police officer pretending to be a cellmate who listens 

and hears. Just as it wouldn't make -- it wouldn't be a 

violation if there were a recording device in the cell 

and the defendant talked to himself, which there are 

cases of that, and it was picked up on the recording 

device. The mere listening, that goes to whether there 

is a violation at all. But the who, there is -- it 

wouldn't matter for our purposes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So, the police know that 

they can get around the clear prohibition of their 

questioning without Miranda warnings by pretending to be 

a jailbird?

 MR. McALLISTER: Potentially, yes. But, 

again, the violation would go to what happens in the 

cell. So if the police officer is pretending to be 

another defendant and sits in the cell and the defendant 

starts telling the officer things, that would not

violate the Sixth Amendment at all under the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: No, I am assuming we are 

not in the area where the jail mate is simply passive. 

In this case, the jail mate made a statement that 

encouraged the defendant. He wasn't just passive. He 

was encouraging the defendant to speak.

 MR. McALLISTER: There was certainly 

testimony about what he was told to do and what he did. 

It does not suggest aggressive efforts, certainly, to 

find out. He may not have been completely silent, but 

he certainly didn't say, tell me what you did, let's 

talk about your crimes. But he did make one arguably 

suggestive statement to the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Anyway, your answer is 

the police officer could affirmatively elicit testimony?

 MR. McALLISTER: No, not that he could 

affirmatively elicit. That's the dividing line between 

the Massiah and Kuhlmann case. He was in the cell --

well, I guess what I'm suggesting is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And for your -- you are 

talking about impeachment only. We are not talking 

about the case in chief. So if the police -- he 

can't -- outside, when he questions the defendant and 

gives no Miranda warnings, that is inadmissible, right?

 MR. McALLISTER: Outside -- well, it would

still be admissible for impeachment. We are asking for 

basically the same rule. It would be the same thing if 

he were in the cell, deliberately elicits, knows he is 

violating Massiah, it couldn't be used in the government 

case in chief, but it could be used for impeachment 

purposes. But that would be true of Miranda, if the 

officer deliberately failed to give the warnings, got a 

statement, they would not be admissible in the case in 

chief; but the Court cases are very clearly, it would be 

admissible for impeachment purposes.

 So we are asking for a precise parallel 

rule.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You are making no 

distinction, then, between the Fifth and Sixth 

Amendment?

 MR. McALLISTER: Well, there may be 

distinctions, and there is an distinction in the text of 

the Fifth Amendment that suggests actually a rule of 

exclusion when you truly have -- when there truly is a 

compelled statement. And the Court has recognized that 

in cases such as Portash, where the witness has given 

use immunity, testifies before the grand jury and the 

government later tries to use it against him. The Court 

says, no, you cannot use that testimony for any purpose.

 So there is a difference between the Sixth

Amendment and Fifth Amendment in that respect.

 But what I was suggesting is the way Massiah 

and Miranda operate is similar in this context, that a 

violation results in suppression of the evidence from 

the government's case in chief, but it remains available 

for use as impeachment.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What about the argument 

that essentially this is like taking a pretrial 

deposition, only one side isn't represented?

 MR. McALLISTER: Well, with all due respect 

to that argument, Your Honor, we disagree with that. 

There are strong incentives for the police, frankly, not 

to do this. And in part one of the reasons -- well, 

there is two. One is the police know if this is truly 

in violation of the Sixth Amendment, then nothing can be 

used in the case in chief. So, at most, it is 

impeachment if the defendant testifies and if the 

defendant testifies inconsistently with whatever is 

elicited.

 But furthermore, given the line the court 

has drawn between Massiah and Kuhlmann and what goes on 

with the informant in the cell, if they can hear the 

statements without deliberately eliciting them, if you 

will, if the informant is present, the defendant wants 

to talk, starts chatting, they discuss the crime, those

statements, the Court has held in Kuhlmann, are 

admissible for all purposes, because they are not a 

Sixth Amendment violation at all.

 So, the police do have some strong 

incentives to actually try to gather the evidence, if 

they are going to, in a way that makes it usable in the 

prosecution's case in chief. It's much less value to 

having it solely for impeachment, which is always going 

to be speculative if it were ever going to be used. It 

would depend on if the defendant testifies and if he 

testifies inconsistently with what he has told an 

informant.

 And in that regard, there are other 

deterrents I would like to mention here as well. The 

informant in this case, for example, in jail recognized 

that he did not want to be an aggressive questioner or 

obvious as a government agent. In fact, he said, I 

didn't really want to ask him questions because I was 

afraid if he felt I was being too nosey, I might get 

hurt. So, the informants have their own incentives to 

be careful here.

 And in this case, it's also important to 

remember that deterrence is simply one side of the 

balance. And the Court has said many times even if 

there would be some deterrent effect to extending the

rule to include impeachment, that doesn't answer the 

question whether it should, in fact, be excluded. That 

still must be weighed against the costs on the other 

side.

 And the Court has numerous cases emphasizing 

the costs that are present on the other side of this 

case. Perjury by criminal defendants is a primary one, 

but also cases talking about the importance of allowing 

the jury to hear the truth and to search for truth.

 The jury here gets to evaluate and did, I 

would argue, quite effectively from Mr. Ventris's 

standpoint, evaluate the defendant's credibility. The 

jury was informed, cross-examination, of the informant's 

circumstances, what benefit he received, who he was, all 

the things they might want to know in deciding whether 

to believe him. His testimony went not solely but 

primarily to the question of who was the shooter in the 

murder in the case, and the jury acquitted Mr. Ventris 

of the murder charge, so they did not believe, at least 

beyond a reasonable doubt, that he in fact was the 

shooter. And that is precisely how this should work.

 We are not saying informants are always 

100 percent reliable, but we are saying the court has a 

long tradition, the country has a long tradition, of 

putting this evidence in front of a jury. It's tested

by cross-examination, knowledge of what the incentives 

are, bringing that out in front of the jury, and then 

the jury decides. There are many of these cases where 

-- this was a typical, one codefendant saying, "he was 

the shooter," the other defendant saying, "no, she was 

the shooter."

 And the informant simply had information 

that was relevant to the credibility. And that's the 

way it was used in this case, was as impeachment on 

rebuttal to evaluate Mr. Ventris's testimony in whether 

the jury believed him or not.

 The other thing I would remind the Court is 

we are simply saying that the rule should be no 

exclusion under the Sixth Amendment for impeachment 

purposes, but that does not mean that the normal rules 

of evidence and other rules of trial procedure do not 

apply. They do. And they might well result in the 

exclusion of some potential informant's testimony. So 

if the government were to want to put on an informant 

who had been convicted many times of perjury and the 

judge said, no, I just do not think this evidence is 

credible enough to even put in front of the jury, not 

this person, the ordinary rules of evidence and trial 

procedure would operate. Furthermore, as happened in 

this case, the judge can, and often will, give

cautionary instructions, limiting instructions. All of 

that remains appropriate, but there is simply no reason 

to exclude the evidence as a matter of the Sixth 

Amendment right to counsel.

 It would be inconsistent, frankly, with --

with, really, the general tone and holdings of the cases 

in the Fourth Amendment, Miranda, and even Sixth 

Amendment territory, including primarily 

Michigan v. Harvey and Nix v. Williams.

 Unless the Court has further questions, I 

will reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MS. SAHARSKY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This Court has consistently allowed the use 

of voluntary statements obtained in violation of 

constitutional standards for impeachment purposes, and 

that same rule should apply here. There is no question 

that Respondent's statements were voluntary, and the 

substantial societal cost of allowing him to commit

perjury unchecked greatly outweighs any speculative 

deterrence benefit that would flow from a per se rule of 

exclusion.

 The purpose of the right to counsel is to 

provide an adversary process to ensure that the 

defendant gets a fair trial. And to effectuate that 

right, the Court has excluded deliberately elicited 

statements from the government's case-in-chief. But not 

allowing the statements for impeachment purposes doesn't 

further that right. Instead, what it does is allow the 

defendant to distort the truth-seeking process, and 

that's just too high a price to pay.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you say there 

is no deterrent value, since the police are -- are not 

going to do this if they know they are not going to be 

able to use this in their case-in-chief. But there is 

also no down side, is there?

 I mean, you say it's only for impeachment 

purposes, but, you know, why not? He -- he may take the 

stand. He may lie. It is better to have this in the 

bank instead of not.

 MS. SAHARSKY: But there is a down side. I 

mean, as this Court recognized in cases versus -- like 

Hudson v. Michigan, for example, the police have their 

own codes of conduct. They have training on

constitutional rules and standards. And if they violate 

those constitutional rules and standards, it has real 

effect for the police. It has effect in terms of 

internal discipline, in -- in terms of limiting their 

career opportunities.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is that internal 

discipline verifiable? Do police officers who engage 

snitches, do they get disciplined, especially if they 

are then able to accomplish what was accomplished here? 

That is, the -- the testimony -- the snitch is then able 

to testify after the defendant testifies.

 MS. SAHARSKY: I don't think that there is 

any evidence in the briefs, and I am not aware of 

specific instances of discipline, but I think that that 

is because this situation arises pretty infrequently. 

You know, when this came up in the Kansas Supreme Court 

it was a case of first impression. And as General 

McAllister noted, there are a lot of reasons why the 

police would want to follow the rule in Kuhlman and send 

the informant in to be a passive listening post. 

Because if --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: On the Federal level is 

there anything one way or another, any manual that 

instructs a U.S. Attorney about the use of snitches to 

extract confessions?

MS. SAHARSKY: I think the Department of 

Justice Manual sets out this Court's rules in terms of 

the Kuhlman case and the Henry case. And then, of 

course, there are also State and the Model Professional 

Ethics Rules that talk about when a prosecutor can 

contact a person who is represented by counsel. And 

there are limitations there as well, both in terms of 

the prosecutor contacting a person represented or using 

an agent contacting a person represented.

 But I mean, those are -- those are 

deterrents. I think the police discipline is a 

deterrent. But I think we also need to -- to focus on 

this Court's cases in the Fourth and Fifth and Sixth 

Amendment Jackson context that taking the evidence and 

making it unavailable in the government's case-in-chief 

is a substantial deterrent.

 This Court said in each of those previous 

case that not having the evidence available in the 

government's case-in-chief is a very high price to pay, 

because that means that the government has to come up 

with other evidence that can meet its burden of proving 

all of the elements of the case beyond a reasonable 

doubt.

 And, as General McAllister noted, it is 

really very speculative, and the police certainly

wouldn't know at the time they are asking questions of 

the defendant, whether this rebuttal impeachment 

evidence could ever be used. It's entirely within the 

control of the defendant. It is only if the defendant 

-- if the government first meets its burden of proof 

with other evidence at trial, and then the defendant 

decides to testify, and then he testifies inconsistently 

with his prior statements.

 And our position is at that point that the 

jury should hear the conflicting evidence just as it has 

heard it in all of these other previous cases and be 

allowed to make a decision about who is telling the 

truth.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me you are 

just confirming the answer to the Chief Justice's 

question. There really isn't any down side. The worst 

that -- the worst that happens is maybe they can't use 

the stuff. But what -- what is the down side?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Again, I -- I think that 

there is a down side in terms of police discipline and 

the deterrence --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Has any police officer 

ever been disciplined for doing this; do you know?

amazing if he has.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Again, I think that most 

police officers just follow the rule that this Court set 

forth in Kuhlman, so that this issue has not arisen 

frequently. But, you know, even if you thought that 

there would be some type of minimal deterrence benefit 

that would arise from -- from not making the evidence 

available for impeachment purposes, you have to balance 

it against the cost to the truth-seeking process that 

would be incurred if the defendant could --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The defendant could 

sometimes lie. But sometimes people who are in this 

position in prison are not the most trustworthy people, 

either.

 MS. SAHARSKY: I think --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You could bring that out 

on cross-examination. I understand that.

 MS. SAHARSKY: That -- that is what I was 

going to say. I mean, as General McAllister noted, that 

-- that happened in this case. The prosecutor himself 

got up and talked about the -- the informant's prior 

offenses, why the informant was in jail, whether the 

informant received anything in exchange for his 

testimony, the fact that the informant had actually gone 

back to jail after testifying -- or after serving as an

informant in this case.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: It seems to me that that 

all confirms the fact, well, they have nothing to lose. 

Maybe we have one witness who is not very persuasive, 

but no harm in giving it a try.

 MS. SAHARSKY: I think that the -- the fact 

that the evidence would be unavailable in the 

government's case-in-chief really is a strong price that 

the government pays. And -- and this Court recognized 

it in in Havens, in Walder, in Harris, in Hass, in 

Harvey, and in all of those prior cases. And there is 

just -- there is not any reason to depart from them, 

because the -- the other side of the balance is that, 

you know, you are letting a defendant to get up and take 

the stand and -- and not subject himself to this prior 

statement.

 And this -- this prior statement, if 

believed by the jury, is incredibly important to his 

credibility, probative with respect to whether the 

crimes were committed and the defendant is telling the 

truth.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: If it is truthfully 

reported. Of course, that is always -- that is an issue 

of credibility in all of these cases.

 MS. SAHARSKY: Yes, every case has a

question about someone's credibility, some witness's 

credibility, and that's for the jury to decide. And in 

-- in this case there was ample cross-examination, and 

there was the limiting instruction that the State 

mentioned.

 I mean, clearly the jury did its job here 

because it went back and it considered all this 

information. And it didn't come back with a -- a 

verdict -- although you, of course, never know exactly 

what the jury is thinking, it didn't come back with a 

verdict suggesting it just reflexively believed the 

informant's testimony.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Ms. Saharsky, I am still a 

little hung up on -- on whether we would be allowing a 

constitutional violation. General McAllister said that 

in the Fifth Amendment area we -- we indeed allow --

allow it to be introduced in rebuttal even though that 

is the actual constitutional violation. Isn't that the 

case other than in the Miranda situation? I mean, 

suppose you have a generally coerced confession. Would 

we -- would we permit that to go in?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Certainly not. In the Fifth 

Amendment context, the text of the amendment itself 

would prohibit the use of that statement for any 

purposes.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Exactly, but why -- why is 

not that the case with the right to counsel?

 MS. SAHARSKY: Because the text of the Sixth 

Amendment doesn't say anything about the exclusion of 

evidence at trial. What it does is it guarantees counsel 

for a purpose, and that purpose is to ensure an 

adversary process at trial. And if counsel is not 

afforded, then it's up to the court to determine what 

the remedy is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: But its real meaning is 

that counsel is guaranteed at trial; isn't that right?

 MS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry. I missed the 

first --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Its root purpose is that 

counsel is guaranteed at trial. And here we're saying 

it's okay not to have counsel at trial so long as it's 

refuting a lie by the defendant.

 MS. SAHARSKY: That's not true. I mean, 

certainly counsel is available at trial. The question is 

just whether statements that were obtained without 

counsel prior to trial can be used for impeachment 

purposes. The answer --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So you say that -- you say 

the Sixth Amendment violation occurs before trial?

 MS. SAHARSKY: I'm sorry if I suggested

that. No, the Sixth Amendment violation occurs when the 

statements are introduced in the government's case in 

chief at trial.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's right.

 MS. SAHARSKY: And that's because the 

government should not be allowed to go behind counsel 

prior to trial and gather up statements, and then use 

them to prove guilt at trial. That subverts the 

adversary process. When you are talking about 

impeachment, you are not talking about proving guilt at 

trial. You are not talking about the government 

distorting the adversary process. If there is any 

distortion of the adversary process, it's with the 

defendant attempting to commit perjury at that point.

 The Sixth Amendment is different from the 

Fifth Amendment in that it doesn't say anything about 

statements that are obtained and if it can be used at 

trial. And that means it's up to courts to balance the 

cost and benefit of exclusion of evidence. And in the 

case of the government's case in chief, that balance 

means that that the statements cannot come in because it 

would be too much of a cost to the adversary process 

that the Sixth Amendment guarantees to allow the 

statements in.

 But, when you switch over in looking at

impeachment, this Court said 50 years ago impeachment is 

a very different story than the government's case in 

chief. The interest that you are talking about 

furthering there, the adversary process interest, would 

not be furthered by allowing the defendant to take the 

stand and be able to commit perjury unchecked. It would 

not be furthered, and it would not lead to greater 

deterrence by simply allowing the statements to be 

unavailable for impeachment purposes, because the great 

deterrent comes with the statements being unavailable in 

the government's case in chief.

 We just don't think there's any reason to 

depart from this Court's rule that, so long as 

statements are not involuntary, they can be used for 

impeachment purposes.

 If there are no further questions, we submit 

the judgment below should be reversed.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW J. EDGE

of all, what we are dealing with in the Sixth Amendment 

case here is a violation of a core enumerated trial 

right, and this makes it a very different animal from 

all the other cases that we are talking about. If we are 

talking about the Fourth Amendment, we are talking about 

something that isn't a trial right. It's a right of the 

people to be secure in their homes and possessions. The 

violation occurs when the police commit whatever 

misconduct makes the search of the evidence illegal. But 

the use of that evidence at trial doesn't work any 

further constitutional --

JUSTICE BREYER: Wasn't this individual 

represented by counsel? Was he represented by counsel?

 MR. EDGE: Yes, he was.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And he was represented by 

counsel at the time that the informant took the 

statement, got the statement elicited? Is that right?

 MR. EDGE: No, I don't think so --

JUSTICE BREYER: I have my memo that I 

haven't looked through carefully, but I would be quite 

interested. I thought he asked for counsel. He was 

given counsel, and subsequent to that, this statement 

was elicited. I would like to know that because the 

Sixth Amendment says you have right to assistance of 

counsel in your defense, period. And I guess, if he had

a lawyer, the lawyer could have told him, "Don't talk to 

informants in the jailhouse." He could have said, "I'm 

going to talk to who I want." Or he might not have. But 

I would be interested in knowing, did he have assistance 

of counsel at the time the statement was elicited? It's 

one thing to me if he did, and another if he didn't. 

Don't know?

 MR. EDGE: No.

 JUSTICE BREYER: How can I find out?

 MR. EDGE: No, the -- I don't know exactly 

the day that this happened. I do know that he was 

arrested on the 16th of January of 2004, and there was a 

search of his cell on January 20th. And we know from 

that testimony that -- why that's relevant that he was 

cellmates with Mr. Doser by that time, and Mr. Doser 

testified that he was the cellmate of Mr. Ventris for 

two days. And on the second day, Mr. Ventris supposedly 

made these statements.

 So my best guess is that the -- this 

conversation occurred sometime between the 17th and the 

20th. Now, the order of appointing counsel was entered 

on January 21st, and counsel doesn't enter his 

appearance until January 27th.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So it might be he asked for 

counsel but hadn't yet received counsel?

MR. EDGE: Correct, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, do I 

understand the first sentence on page 6 of your brief to 

concede that there's no deterrent value from prohibiting 

the introduction of these statements for impeachment? 

The sentence says, "A Sixth Amendment exclusionary rule 

that allowed use of uncounseled statements for 

impeachment would not deter violations of the right to 

counsel."

 MR. EDGE: That's correct, Your Honor. And 

the reason I believe this is that, as long as there's 

some kind of incentive for the prosecutor to use 

informants in this manner, then the only -- then even if 

they are not usable in the case in chief, there is still 

an incentive to use this kind of evidence, and the 

prosecutor and the police will attempt to obtain it. 

There's simply very little downside. The prosecutor 

instructs the informant not to deliberately elicit the 

statement. The prosecutor is still responsible for the 

informant, because the informant is his agent, so even 

if -- when the informant goes ahead and deliberately 

elicits the statement, it's still a constitutional 

violation. But so long as you allow it for some kind of 

purpose, then there isn't a deterrent effect, and to --

have here, where the law enforcement officers do not 

instruct the informant to do anything that would violate 

the Sixth Amendment and in fact, according to their 

testimony, instruct him to engage in conduct that is 

consistent with the Sixth Amendment, there's no 

deterrent value in later suppressing the use of the 

statements for impeachment purposes?

 MR. EDGE: I mean -- I guess, maybe I am 

confused. There is a deterrent -- there is a deterrent 

effect from suppressing it in the case in chief, but 

it's not sufficient unless it's also extended to use in 

rebuttal as well.

 JUSTICE ALITO: But what do you want to 

deter? You want to deter them from using informants at 

all, even in a manner that is consistent with the Sixth 

Amendment?

 MR. EDGE: No, Your Honor. What I am 

attempting to deter is the sort of up-ending of the 

adversarial system that this represents. There was a 

question that was presented earlier about when does this 

violation occur? And I think that gets to the manner of 

-- or the nature of the Sixth Amendment violation. Our 

contention is that the violation occurs when the 

statement is extracted, and then it's further aggravated 

when it's used at trial. When the police obtain these

kinds of statements, even if they are not used at trial, 

it does work a harm on the defendant and his 

relationship with counsel. It affects defendant's --

JUSTICE BREYER: I see the problem. I wonder 

if you have an answer to another question. You may not. 

I can't find it. It seems to me it's been 20 years since 

this -- nearly 20 -- since the Court decided the 

Michigan case. The other cases were decided even 

earlier. And it's just surprising to me that it has 

never come up or rarely, rarely come up that the 

question of whether the State can introduce into 

evidence a statement made when the State questioned an 

individual who'd asked for counsel or had counsel out of 

the presence of the counsel.

 I mean, does that normally happen, or does 

it never happen? Why is there so little law on it? Do 

you have any idea?

 MR. EDGE: I do not, Your Honor. And I am 

really at a loss to speculate as to why that would be.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You agree with the 

representations on -- from your friends on the other 

side that there is no case of ours where we have 

excluded a statement of evidence submitted for 

impeachment, even though it would have been excluded in 

this case in chief? If you prevail here, it would be

the first time that any evidence or statement has been 

excluded when submitted for purposes of impeachment?

 MR. EDGE: It would be a very different 

rule. I think the only rule that this would be the case 

so far is in Portash, the self-incrimination clause. We 

are saying that the same type of rule should apply to 

the Sixth Amendment. Otherwise, no, that's correct, 

whenever you are talking about the Fourth Amendment or 

one of the prophylactic rules like Miranda or Jackson, 

then they are admissible for impeachment purposes. What 

makes this case different is that it -- it involves a 

violation of an enumerated Constitutional trial right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: That's what I'm not certain 

about. And this is why I ask -- have been asking these 

questions and what I can't figure out in my own mind is 

this.

 I ask for a lawyer. The State has some 

period of time to give me a lawyer. Now it's one thing 

if what's going on is once I ask for a lawyer, the State 

should deal with me through my lawyer; that's how they 

are supposed to do it. But that isn't as basic --

that's like a rule of ethics in most States in civil 

context and other contexts -- that's not as basic as if 

I ask for a lawyer and then the State just doesn't give 

me one, though it should.

That's a different violation, a different 

kind of violation. One is a kind of a rule of ethics 

incorporated in the Constitution. The second is what 

the case is -- is what the Constitution is really about, 

give him a lawyer when he asks for one. And which is 

this case? That -- that's why I'm having hard time. Is 

it the first or the second?

 MR. EDGE: Well, in -- I think one of the 

complicating factors here, Your Honor, is that the State 

in this particular case didn't try a straightforward 

interrogation. They sent in an undercover informant.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, no, no. I will 

amalgamate that for you. I will say they are exactly 

the same thing. But what I want to know is what rule is 

violated, what Sixth Amendment rule. The rule -- you 

heard what I said, the rule "don't talk to a guy who 

wants a lawyer until you talk to the lawyer." No 

communications with a client. It's a communication with 

the lawyer. That's one thing.

 And the other rule is he has asked for a 

lawyer but you never gave him one. Now which is this 

case? I mean, I first thought well if he didn't have a 

lawyer at all, then it must be the second; but then I 

thought they must have a reasonable time to give him a 

lawyer, and they haven't violated that second.

If you have any view on that, it would be 

helpful to me.

 MR. EDGE: I don't know whether he had asked 

for a lawyer or not. I know that he was entitled to one 

at the time, and one would be appointed for him. But 

otherwise--

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But we do know that 

unlike the police giving Miranda warnings, there's no 

warning here at all. I mean, he thinks he is talking to 

a cellmate. Nobody tells him, "remember you've got a 

right to be represented by counsel," and he's 

essentially giving a statement without the Miranda 

warnings.

 MR. EDGE: That's correct, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the other side says 

well, practically, the defendant is much more likely to 

say something that's really involuntary when he is 

confronting police officers, that the reason that we 

exclude in the case of a police officer is this 

intimidating setting, when the defendant is in the 

police station or in the cell and there are these police 

officers. Now he thinks he's just with a cellmate, so 

there isn't -- there isn't the coercive atmosphere that 

there is when the police do the questioning.

 MR. EDGE: Well, Your Honor, I think that

there certainly can be a coercive atmosphere even if you 

are not talking to a known police agent. Now, those are 

not the facts of this particular case and there is no 

claim that the statement was involuntary. However, one 

of the advantages of speaking to known police officers 

is that a defendant can simply end the interrogation by 

invoking his right to counsel, and that is not 

necessarily a course of action that is available to him 

if he thinks he is merely talking to a cellmate, 

somebody who whether he wants to speak to him or not is 

going to be in the cell with him for some time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, you've --

you've emphasized that what distinguishes this case from 

the other ones where we have allowed evidence that would 

be excluded from the case in chief and for impeachment 

purposes is that this is a trial right. But the Sixth 

Amendment says in criminal prosecutions you have a right 

to the assistance of counsel. Well, he had assistance 

of counsel here, and one of the things that counsel did 

was point out the problems with relying on the snitch's 

evidence and all the bad things that he did.

 But -- but just like in the case of a Fourth 

Amendment violation where we allow the evidence to be 

admitted at trial, this Sixth Amendment problem, you 

know, it doesn't -- I just don't see the -- the strength

of that distinction.

 MR. EDGE: Your Honor, I think it goes to 

the nature of the harm that comes from a Sixth Amendment 

violation. The Sixth Amendment simply doesn't limit 

itself to the trial. The exact wording of the -- the 

constitutional provision is in all criminal 

prosecutions.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, it seems to me 

you are getting away from the basis for your 

distinction, then. Saying well, it's not just at trial. 

Well, these other constitutional rights where we have 

allowed the evidence to come in for impeachment are 

indistinguishable from the Sixth Amendment right, 

outside of trial.

 MR. EDGE: Well, because the harm isn't 

something that just affects the outcome of the trial, it 

also affects the -- it affects the litigation in a much, 

much deeper way. It affects counsel's trial strategy, 

it affects the defendant's decision whether or not to 

testify. It also --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just to pause on 

that, it affects his decision to testify because it 

makes it more likely that he will testify truthfully if 

he is going to testify.

 MR. EDGE: Not necessarily.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The focus -- the 

focus on the context is at least a double-edged sword 

because the harm that we are facilitating under your 

rule is to allow perjured testimony.

 MR. EDGE: Yes, Your Honor, in some contexts 

it would. I think one of the underlying assumptions of 

the State's argument with regard to perjury is that the 

mere existence of a prior inconsistent statement is 

necessarily indicative of perjury, and we know there are 

many reasons why the defendant may have given a prior 

inconsistent statement.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, and if he has 

the assistance at trial consistent with the Sixth 

Amendment, those -- those problems could be pointed out. 

He was -- he was he is not lying now. The reason he 

said something different then was, you know, he likes to 

brag in prison or whatever the basis is.

 MR. EDGE: In some cases it will be possible 

for counsel to vigorously cross-examine the informant. 

In others it may not. But in addition to that, Your 

Honor, I would also say that it doesn't simply affect 

the decision whether or not to go to trial or whether or 

not to testify at trial; it also affects the litigation 

in a very deep way, inasmuch as the defendant is 

burdened in trying to negotiate a favorable plea deal.

Every statement or every piece of evidence 

that the State has affects their willingness to plea 

bargain, and when the State obtains this kind of 

evidence illegally, it puts the defendant in a bind for 

-- puts the defendant's counsel in a bind.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think -- I think 

that's quite right. But I don't see how excluding the 

evidence even on impeachment helps that. I mean, 

they've still got the statement, and they -- I mean, you 

know -- I guess your point, you know, maybe they will 

get some leads from it even if they can't use it. But 

excluding the evidence for impeachment purposes doesn't 

eliminate that harm.

 MR. EDGE: It would, Your Honor, inasmuch it 

would remove any disincentive for the police to obtain 

this evidence by this manner in the first place. So 

there would be that marginal deterrent factor.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Which of the things that 

you've just said result from the use of this for 

impeachment would not be true with respect to the other 

situations where illegally obtained evidence has been 

used for impeachment purposes? Take the Fourth 

Amendment, for example.

 MR. EDGE: I think they would be largely the 

same, Your Honor. The difference would be in the

interest protected. The self-incrimination clause in 

the Fifth Amendment is aimed primarily at coercion of 

the defendant; whereas, the Sixth Amendment aims 

primarily at the preservation of an adversarial process, 

the relationship between counsel and his attorney.

 JUSTICE ALITO: You don't dispute that there 

was a Sixth Amendment violation at the time this 

statement was taken, do you?

 MR. EDGE: No, I do not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You urged a -- a 

fall-back, and you said at least that there may -- there 

should be a determination by the judge that the 

defendant intentionally testified falsely. And I was 

wondering how that would operate. You are here in the 

-- the heat of the trial, and the prosecutor says, I 

want to call snitch so-and-so. And then what do we do, 

just interrupt the trial and have kind of a mini trial 

to test the credibility of the -- the informant?

 MR. EDGE: Yes, you could, Your Honor. 

Also, you could have it as part of the pretrial 

suppression hearings. I would anticipate that even if 

the -- if the Court were to adopt our position, these 

kinds of Sixth Amendment cases are still going to be 

litigated. The issue is simply going to be whether or 

not the States or the police agent is deliberately

eliciting the statement or not.

 So there is -- there is likely going to be 

some kind of pretrial litigation regarding the 

admissibility of the statements, and it could be handled 

at that time.

 If there are no further questions, I will 

reserve the remainder of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. McAllister, you have six minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. McALLISTER: Two points by way of 

rebuttal. The balancing of the interests here is 

sprinkling water under the bridge even in the Sixth 

Amendment context. In both Nix versus Williams and 

Michigan versus Harvey where the Court was dealing with 

Sixth Amendment interests and the Sixth Amendment right 

to counsel violations, the bulk of those cases make 

clear that the question of what exclusionary effect to 

give a violation is subject to a balancing analysis. 

And that's what we are asking for here. That's why it's 

treated for these purposes like the Fourth Amendment in 

the Miranda context.

 And Nicks itself, to paraphrase the Court, 

makes a fundamental point which I think illustrates how

this works, and it worked effectively to defendant's 

advantage in this case.

 In Nix v. Williams, the Court said the Sixth 

Amendment right to counsel -- and I am paraphrasing 

slightly -- protects against unfairness by assuring an 

adversary process in which proffered evidence is tested 

by cross-examination. And it's done in front of a jury. 

It is not about requiring the exclusion of entire 

categories of witnesses or types of evidence for all 

purposes.

 So the right to counsel was exercised. It 

was exercised effectively in this case when Mr. Doser 

was strongly cross-examined by defense counsel.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would that apply equally 

for statements under oath?

 MR. McALLISTER: It could, Your Honor. I 

realize a logical extension is you could say just test 

all of it. But that is where the -- the police here and 

prosecutor pay the price of the way in which the 

evidence was obtained. It's excluded from the 

government's case-in-chief.

 Unless there are further questions, we would 

respectfully ask that this Court reverse the decision 

below.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel.
