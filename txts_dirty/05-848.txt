 (10:02 a.m.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument first this morning in Environmental Defense 

versus Duke Energy Corporation. Mr. Donahue.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN H. DONAHUE

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 MR. DONAHUE: Good morning, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The Clean Air Act requires that the owner of 

a major emitting facility obtain a prevention of 

significant deterioration permit before engaging in a 

modification, which is defined to include any physical 

change that increases the amount of any pollutant 

emitted by such source.

 Since 1980, EPA's PSD regulations have 

measured such increases in terms of actual emissions in 

tons per year.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a disputed 

point, I gather, central to the case, whether or not the 

regulations measured PSD emissions through that device 

rather than the hourly emissions.

 MR. DONAHUE: That's correct, Mr. Chief 

Justice, but the text of the regulations refers 

pervasively, and I'm referring to the definition of

major modification which is in 40 CFR 51.166(b)(2) and 

subsequent paragraphs of that regulation, refers 

pervasively to actual emissions and measures emissions 

exclusively in tons per year.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It is a little of an 

exaggeration, though, to say that EPA has since the 

issuance of the regulations always interpreted them the 

way that you prefer. In fact, the director of the PSD 

program gave two opinions in which he took precisely the 

interpretation that opposing counsel took.

 MR. DONAHUE: Yes, Justice Scalia. 

Respondent has relied heavily on two early applicability 

determinations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Rightly so, I think. I 

mean, it was the earliest, application of the 

regulation by the officer of the agency specifically in 

charge of the program.

 MR. DONAHUE: Well, Justice Scalia, as we 

point out in our brief, Director Reich does not adopt 

Duke's theory, in fact contradicts it. He doesn't say 

that a new source performance standard modification must 

precede a PSD major modification. Instead, in both he 

relies on the express exclusion in the PSD regulations 

for increases in hours of operation and the production 

rate, and as EPA explained in its contemporaneous

preamble, that provision by its terms is an exception 

from the definition of physical change.

 It is not a provision that says -- increase 

is attributable to a physical change, to increased hours 

that are enabled by physical change, are not considered. 

The plain language of the regulation actually 

contradicts this reading. These determinations 

themselves are quite ambiguous, and of course they are 

two of dozens of such determinations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, whatever the reason 

he gave, was it -- these opinions were out there when 

the challenge to the regulations, in which Duke did not 

participate, when that challenge was brought, were 

these -- were those opinions already out there?

 MR. DONAHUE: Those opinions were out there 

but the plain language of the regulation and the 

preamble which explain that the increased hours exclusion 

was simply to allow companies to respond to demand and to 

link the coverage of PSD to construction activity. What 

we have here is a physical change in the plants, massive 

renovations of these elaborate networks of pipes and 

tubes that compose a central component.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I understand that, and I 

think you may have the better of the argument on me on 

the interpretation of the PSD regulations. But what I

am concerned about is that companies can get whipsawed. 

They don't challenge the regulations when they come out 

because as far as they know, the agency is interpreting 

them in a way that they favor. And then some years 

later, when it turns out the agency is using a different 

interpretation, you have the jurisdictional bar.

 MR. DONAHUE: Well, Justice Scalia, these 

regulations were challenged early on and there was a --

as the Court is aware, there was a settlement agreement 

in 1982 to which Duke was, in fact, a party, that 

proposed to add the hourly rate test that is completely 

absent from these regulations.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But could Duke have had a 

challenge to the 1992 or 2000 regulations? Could they 

have reopened the issue at that point?

 MR. DONAHUE: They did in fact precisely that, 

Justice Kennedy, and that was resolved in the New York 

proceeding by the D.C. Circuit. Duke didn't challenge 

the very prominent aspect of the 1980 regulations, which 

was to move away from the potential emissions test of 

prior --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I don't want to jump ahead 

to the jurisdictional argument if you want to talk about 

the modification substantive point first, but it is not 

clear to me whether Duke should have acted in 1980,

1992 or 2000, or all of the above.

 MR. DONAHUE: Well, the regulations were 

clear on their face. I mean, to determine the effect of 

307 --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's an audacious 

statement.

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE SCALIA: We've wrestled with these 

things for several days. It's disappointing to hear you 

tell us they're clear.

 MR. DONAHUE: They're clear in this respect, 

they did not include an hourly rate test. As Judge Posner 

in the Cinergy opinion this summer said, the argument 

that the statute mandates an hourly rate test is a 

challenge to the validity of these 1980 regulations 

because they don't say it, they don't provide for it, 

and they are very specific and detailed, and instead turn 

on actual annual emissions. And the entire rationale 

EPA offered was linked to that effort to capture real 

world changes in emissions.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If they are so clear, how 

can you account for Mr. Reich's interpretation? He's an 

expert in the area.

 MR. DONAHUE: Right. He misapplied, he 

didn't adopt this theory, the theory that an NSPS

modification precedes at all; in fact, he contradicted 

it. He misapplied in quite sort of anomalous 

circumstances the increased hours --

JUSTICE ALITO: I know you say he's wrong, 

but if somebody in his position with his expertise can 

interpret the regulations in that way, doesn't that show 

that they're not clear on their face?

 MR. DONAHUE: We think that this Court can 

resolve, can interpret, can address the reasonableness 

of EPA's construction of the increased hours exclusion. 

What it can't do is certainly what the Fourth Circuit 

did, which is to say that the PSD regulations must be 

the same. They are obviously not the same. They are 

different in multiple respects. And certainly that 

challenge could have been raised, and certainly that 

challenge was barred, and of course the court of appeals 

expressly called the regulations irrelevant, the texts 

and interpretations of the regulations. That's exactly 

what a court is supposed to be doing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. In deciding whether 

the regulations are reasonable, however, is it proper 

for a court to take into account that the regulations 

must follow the prescription of the statute that the PSD 

definition be the same as the NSPS -- what is it -- NSPS 

definition? I mean, that's a usual tool of statutory --

or regulatory construction.

 Cannot a court give great weight to that in 

interpreting these ambiguous regulations?

 MR. DONAHUE: Well, that -- they're not 

ambiguous as to whether they're identical, and to hold 

that they have to be is certainly an invalidation. And 

the D.C. Circuit, of course, held that the statute 

doesn't require identity as between the two sets of 

regulations. And we're not here on certiorari from the 

New York decision, we're here on an enforcement action 

in which a court leapt over the express limitations 

imposed on it, declared the language of the regulations 

irrelevant, and indeed misapplied them rather 

dramatically.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't think the 

same argument has necessarily to be made, but the 

question still before us is how you interpret the 

regulations. Let's assume that's just a regulatory 

interpretation question, it's not a statutory question.

 MR. DONAHUE: Right. Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But in deciding that, 

whatever was argued in prior cases, it seems to me that 

we're entitled to take into account the necessity that 

the regulations comply with the statute. And if they 

are ambiguous, we should resolve the ambiguity in the

direction that it seems to us would provide consistency 

with the statute. Now does that violate the 

jurisdictional bar?

 MR. DONAHUE: No. I have no problem with 

any of that. If the regulations are ambiguous, take 

into account the statutory text, structure, policies. 

What the court below did, of course, was say it doesn't 

matter what the regulations say, these have to be the 

same. It forgot that in fact, these regulations were 

very different. The D.C. Circuit said there's no 

statutory mandate of identity and that the -- and, of 

course, Respondent was there in the D.C. Circuit. It 

was permitted to assert a challenge to this divergence, 

as the court called it, between NSPS regulations and 

PSD. And the court said --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: If the regulations 

are ambiguous, then the agency can interpret them in 

different ways and can change its interpretation over 

time. Of course, what your friend argues happened here 

is that the agency changed its interpretation in the 

context of an enforcement program. Now accepting that 

premise, what is the -- what should Duke have done when 

that interpretation was changed in an enforcement 

program?

 MR. DONAHUE: Accepting that premise, they

could have sought an applicability determination. Duke 

knew very well what EPA's interpretation was because of 

the WEPCO decision. EPA had been -- and subsequent 

actions. In fact, Duke's attorneys were vociferously 

charging that EPA changed the rules and was acting ultra 

vires.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Donahue, were there 

earlier enforcement actions in which EPA was taking the 

position that it took in this action against Duke?

 MR. DONAHUE: Well, in the WEPCO decision --

I mean, EPA has always taken the position that actual 

annual emissions is the standard under the 1980 rules.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But were they, in fact, 

enforcing that standard? So that -- you said that Duke 

could have asked for a non-applicability ruling, but at 

the time Duke started up its --

MR. DONAHUE: Certainly. I mean, WEPCO was 

an applicability determination. That was in 1989-90. 

Puerto Rican Cement was an applicability determination. 

Duke instead, knowing that EPA believed that increased 

utilization that is caused by physical change has to be 

considered under this, as is prescribed in these very 

detailed regulations, Duke decided not to do that, to go 

forward, and it didn't, in fact, come to the State or to 

EPA.

Of course, the increased hours -- I 

understand the Court's concern about the Reich memos. 

But EPA's construction of the increased hours exception 

is completely correct under the plain language of the 

regulations. And in WEPCO the Court upheld. So that 

there was no question that not only was it consistent 

with the plain language, but whatever Reich had said, 

the express language of the regulations was as far as 

the exception went. There was no further confusion, if 

those early memos caused confusion.

 I'd like to reserve the balance of my 

time. Thank you.

Mr. Donahue.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR,

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES

 MR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

 The court of appeals exceeded its 

jurisdiction and misconstrued the Clean Air Act in 

holding that EPA was required to define the term 

"modification" identically for the separate NSPS and PSD 

programs, and on the jurisdictional point I'd like to 

address the whipsaw question, because in fact it's quite

clear that there's no whipsaw issue here for a number of 

reasons. It's true that there are those ambiguous and 

cursory 1981 statements from Mr. Reich, who was a 

subordinate official within EPA. In 1988, the 

administrator of EPA, the head of the agency, in the 

WEPCO decision, the applicability determination, made 

very clear what EPA's position is on the application of 

the hours of operation exclusion and the fact that this 

is an annual tons per year test. That's page 44 of the 

joint appendix. He made that perfectly clear and it has 

always been clear that that is, in fact, the EPA's official 

position beginning with the 1980 preamble. But again --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Should a challenge 

to that have been brought in the D.C. Circuit at that 

time, or would you have argued that's too late?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, I'm not sure whether it 

could have been brought at that time. But the fact of 

the matter is a challenge was brought on this issue 

in -- to the 1980 regulations. True, Duke didn't assert 

it, but General Motors and the steel industry did assert 

in the 1981 brief they filed in that challenge to the 

1980 rule --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, presumably 

Duke could say, we looked at the Reich memorandum and we 

were following that and all of a sudden this new 1988

thing came up and they are surprised by that. Now 

you're saying it's already too late because somebody 

else challenged it in 1980?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, they might have that 

argument, Your Honor, except for the fact that the 

challenge to the 1980 rules was stayed and was not 

reopened until 2003.

 In 2003, Duke and other parties sought to 

reopen and were granted permission to reopen that 

challenge to the 1980 rules. They filed a statement of 

issues in 1984 and a brief in 1984 challenging the 

regulation on the ground that if EPA's interpretation 

was correct and that it did not require an increase in 

maximum total achievable emissions, as the NSPS did, 

test did, they argued that it was invalid. They raised 

the very incorporation theory that they advance here, 

that is the statutory argument that Congress was 

required to follow for the PSD regulations the same 

regulatory approach that the NSPS regulations had 

followed in 1977 with the hourly maximum achievable 

test. They made that very argument in their brief in 

the D.C. Circuit in 2004, the D.C. Circuit addressed and 

rejected that argument on the merits.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: To be fair to them, 

that very same argument was more a product of the Fourth

Circuit than of Duke. They had a somewhat different 

approach before the Fourth Circuit and then the Fourth 

Circuit came up with this insistence on the parallel 

construction.

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes. Well, I think it's 

important to distinguish. There are two statutory 

arguments here. One is what I would call the 

incorporation theory. That is the argument that 

Congress by borrowing the definition, the statutory 

definition, also necessarily borrowed and mandated 

adoption of the regulatory definition from the NSPS 

program. That argument, the incorporation argument, was 

made by Duke in its brief in 2004 in the D.C. Circuit. 

The D.C. Circuit addressed and rejected that argument at 

pages 17 through 19 of its decision in its 2005 New York 

decision.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why was that rejection 

wrong? Because this issue is still important to me for 

purposes of statutory construction. Is it conceivable 

that when Congress says the word widget in this statute 

has to mean the same as the word widget in the other 

statute, that the agency can effectively frustrate the 

apparent Congressional intent by saying, oh, yes, I 

mean, yes, that has to mean the same thing, but we can 

adopt regulations under one statute which regulations

say it means one thing, and we can adopt regulations 

under another statute that says it means something else. 

I mean, to say that they have to mean the same 

thing it seems to me means that the regulations have to 

say they mean the same thing.

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, it is a fundamental 

principle of administrative law and deference to agency 

decisionmaking that when Congress adopts an ambiguous 

statutory phrase and charges the agency with 

implementing that phrase the agency has discretion, has 

a delegation of rulemaking authority and policymaking 

authority to choose from among the various permissible 

interpretations.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course it does, but when 

Congress says the definition in the two statutes has to 

be the same, whatever choice the agency makes among 

those options has to be applied to both, it seems to me.

 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor, because 

Congress has not mandated, as it could have done, that 

the choice of the specific interpretation from among the 

permissible options must be identical across both 

programs.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, then it's meaningless 

to say the definition has to be the same.

 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA: Entirely meaningless.

 MR. HUNGAR: The statutory definition is 

ambiguous, but within the limits of the ambiguity it 

imposes constraints on the discretion of the agency. 

The agency must choose from among the options that are 

permissible given the range of language that Congress 

used. But within that range the agency has discretion. 

Think of it this way, Your Honor. If there were no PSD 

program, if we were talking only about the NSPS program, 

Congress gave an ambiguous definition to the agency the 

agency would have discretion to adopt different tests 

for determining whether emissions increased for 

different types of equipment even within that single 

program, because the statutory definition is ambiguous. 

The statute therefore does not mandate a one size fits 

all approach and the agency in its discretion could well 

determine that one emissions test is appropriate for 

some types of equipment, another emissions test is 

appropriate for other types of equipment, as long as 

both of those tests are within the permissible bounds 

of the statutory ambiguity. The agency is entitled to 

do that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the ambiguity is the 

word "increase," which could mean different things?

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor.

understand it now has a proposed regulation that would 

align the standards with the two programs. It would 

bring the nonproliferation -- it would bring the 

standard for the nonproliferation program in line with 

the new source performance standard.

 MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor, with respect 

to certain types of units, electric generating units 

like those at issue in this case, that's correct. They 

would not be identical under the proposal, but would be 

similar.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, since the 

government is now taking the position that another Duke 

could do just what was done here and there's an 

enforcement action pending, would you, if you prevailed 

in that enforcement action, nonetheless enforce, though 

it's those against the current government policy?

 MR. HUNGAR: Your Honor, the 2005 proposal 

that you're referring to is only a proposal, a notice of 

proposed rulemaking. It has not been adopted. So the 

rules as they exist today are the same as the ones we're 

talking about, although there was a modification in 

2002. But in any event, what we're talking about here 

is conduct that occurred from 1988 through 2000 with

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what exactly are you 

seeking in these enforcement proceedings? An injunction 

to install the BACT or criminal fines or civil fine, or 

what?

 MR. HUNGAR: It is civil enforcement 

proceedings, Your Honor. There are various remedies, 

injunctive relief and civil penalties where appropriate, 

yes.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: If you have an enforcement 

proceeding and there is a legitimate question of whether 

or not the agency's interpretation is consistent with 

the statute with Chevron deference and so forth and the 

court looks at it and says, you know, I have a real 

problem with the way the agency interpreted the basic 

statute when it first issued the regulation, the court 

can't get into that merely because the parties didn't 

present it earlier?

 MR. HUNGAR: That's correct.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The court's almost issuing 

an advisory opinion in a way.

 MR. HUNGAR: No, Your Honor. It's not an 

advisory opinion. The court is simply precluded from 

considering a challenge that would invalidate the 

regulation because that is the determination Congress 

made in requiring pre-enforcement review to avoid the

problem of inconsistent determinations and circuit 

conflicts and 700 district judges potentially construing 

the statute in different ways and tying EPA's hands. 

The Congress made that determination.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Are there other areas in 

the law where courts have to take as binding a legal 

proposition that they think is dead wrong when they --

MR. HUNGAR: It's quite common. It's quite 

common, Your Honor, in any regime where review of an 

agency decision is relegated to the exclusive 

jurisdiction of one court, as it is here, and 

enforcement proceedings are brought in a different 

court. Hobbs Act agencies, their decisions are 

reviewable in the court of appeals but often enforceable 

in the district courts. The district court cannot look 

behind the determination of the agency to challenge its 

validity because that rests in the exclusive jurisdiction 

of the court of appeals. Obviously there's a timing 

issue in this statute as well because of the requirement 

of pre-enforcement review. Whatever -- whatever concerns 

might be raised in a situation where a party could not 

reasonably have been expected to challenge it at the 

time it was originally promulgated are addressed by the 

after-arising provision in section 307(b)(1) which 

permits challenges that could not have been made within

the 60-day period to be brought later in appropriate 

circumstances. And in any event, if there were some 

concerns at the outer limits of a provision like this 

one, they have nothing to do with this case where Duke's 

challenge, actual challenge to the agency decision, the 

1980 rule, it was heard in 2005.

 And so Duke had more opportunity than you 

could possibly ask for to understand exactly what EPA's 

position was, understand exactly what the regulation 

meant and to challenge it in the D.C. Circuit. It did 

so and it can't do it here.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Hungar, I'm curious. 

What happens if you have a new company that wasn't around 

when the regulation was issued? Can it -- can it bring a 

challenge to the conformity of the regulation to the 

statute?

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, I think that's an 

unresolved question. Presumably, the argument --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, a nice question. I 

mean, all you have to do is find a stalking horse. Just 

have some new company carry your water for you.

 MR. HUNGAR: Well, presumably the argument 

would be that the creation of the company and the first 

applicability of the regulations to it is an 

after-arising ground. I don't know the answer to that

question, but certainly it's not presented here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could it bring it up by a 

declaration of non-applicability? Could the new 

company -- how would it --

MR. HUNGAR: Well, it could seek a 

determination of non-applicability, but -- and it could 

obtain judicial review of that determination. But that 

would not go to the D.C. Circuit and would not permit a 

challenge to the regulations. But they could find a 

petition, they clearly could find a petition for 

rulemaking with the EPA, saying your regulation is 

invalid, it's been around for 25 years, but it's still 

invalid, you need to rescind it, and when the agency 

declined to do that they could then go to the D.C. Circuit.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In the midst of the 

enforcement action that's being brought against them by 

EPA? What's supposed to happen in the enforcement 

action, if that's the vehicle through which EPA is 

implementing its new interpretation --

MR. HUNGAR: If this completely speculative 

and hypothetical situation were ever to arise, a court 

might well exercise its equitable discretion to stay 

proceedings pending review in the D.C. Circuit.

argument. On page 26 of your brief, I think it's 

explained well. You set out the regs and the reg says 

that a major modification is "any physical change in the 

method of operation that would lead to a significant net 

emissions increase." Then you have little (iii), which 

is an exception, and it excepts a physical change which 

leads to -- is just an increase in the hours of 

operation or the production rate.

 So that's out of it. Now, the question is 

what's in it? If that's out of it, what's in it? I 

think what they've said is, if you think about that, 

we'll tell you what must be out of it is a physical 

change that does nothing to increase the capacity, but 

just means you can run it more hours. And they say their 

proof of that is that that was the EPA's interpretation 

for years and years and years. Indeed, we did what we 

did thinking that was it.

 And then after we did what we did, they 

pulled the rug out from under us and said no, that isn't 

it; now it means any physical change, like you change a 

nut, or a bolt, or a tube, even though there's no increased 

capacity to emit more. It's just you run it more hours.

 Now, that they say is basically unfair, it's 

not what this reg has been about. And they made that 

argument, according to them, very strongly and the

Fourth Circuit took the argument and changed it all 

around and made some propositions of law that it's hard 

for even them to defend.

 All right. Now, that's what I think, that's 

what I think is lying -- maybe that's lying at the 

heart of it. And if it is, what do you say?

 MR. HUNGAR: There are several things, Your 

Honor. First of all the language of the regulation 

simply does not support that interpretation. What the 

regulation says is that hours of -- a change in hours of 

operation is not a physical change. Fine. But we have 

a physical change here. It is undisputed that Duke made 

physical changes to its facilities, major modifications, 

sort of using that term in the non-regulatory sense, but 

substantial replacements of physical equipment at the 

facilities. So physical change has occurred. The hours 

of operation exclusion, therefore, has no longer any 

relevance because it applies only at the physical change 

step of the analysis.

 There has been a physical change here 

regardless of whether hours of operation changed or not. 

Therefore, the hours of operation exclusion no longer 

applies. The next question is whether the -- if the 

physical change that did occur resulted in a significant 

net emissions increase. Here it did under the plain

language of the regulations and under the test that EPA 

applies. It is true that 1981 they were arguably 

mistaken to the extent one can discern what the, 

Mr. Reich was actually saying, they seem to be simply a 

mistake in interpretation. But in 1988, the 

administrator of the agency, the head of the agency, 

made very clear EPA's position, the very same position 

it is taking here today on the hours of operation 

exclusion. The First Circuit in the Puerto Rican Cement 

case, as Your Honor knows, upheld that interpretation in 

1989. The Seventh Circuit in footnote 11 in the WEPCO 

decision upheld that determination in 1990. It was 

restated by the EPA again and again and it is well 

established.

 Thank you, Your Honor.

 ORAL ARGUMENT BY CARTER G. PHILLIPS,

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

rules. Because it seems to me it is very clear that the 

understanding of everyone in the industry, outside the 

industry, from 1980, candidly well beyond 1988 all the 

way up until 1999, was that these regulations didn't apply 

under any circumstances in the absence of an increase in 

the capacity. And you had to demonstrate that there 

would be an increase in the hourly rate of the 

emissions.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then why were some 

companies asking for declarations of nonapplicability?

 MR. PHILLIPS: To confirm precisely that 

interpretation. That's exactly why GE went to Mr. Reich 

and asked for a determination of applicability, and was 

told categorically PSD applicability is determined by 

evaluating any change in emissions rates caused by the 

conversion.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Mr. Donahue said that 

there were nonapplicability applications after those 

early ones that came out the other way. So there were 

companies --

MR. PHILLIPS: No. Well --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- who asked for a 

declaration of nonapplication and then EPA took the 

position that it is currently taking.

was talking about WEPCO. Understand the context of 

WEPCO. WEPCO was a situation where every one of the 

changes was a modification within the meaning of NSPS. 

And then the question is were they also modification --

major modifications within the -- within the meaning of 

the PSD. And that's what they analyzed. So it didn't 

say anything about the argument we've been making which 

is what is a modification. The only statements that I 

know of that are out there are the two Reich statements 

which I just quoted to you, says exactly our 

interpretation. But even more powerful at least in my 

view is the quotation from the amicus brief from the 

State of Alabama and the 12 States that relied on the 

Region 4 statement and that's on pages 7 and 8 of that 

amicus brief and the answer, the question is -- you 

know -- how do you determine what is a modification? 

You know does something that doesn't increase the hours, 

the emissions per hour, constitute it? It says no. 

Since the modification does not cause any increase in 

the hourly particulate emissions, no increase in annual 

emissions should be calculated. They could not have said 

that any more clearly than --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Who was saying that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: That is the -- it is the 

chief of the air and waste management division, James

Wolburn, giving guidance to Region 4. Region 4 is not 

only Alabama, it is also North Carolina and South 

Carolina. And then, in the wake of this, right? 1982, 

North Carolina and South Carolina submit their SIPs and 

in their SIPs, certainly the South Carolina SIP 

expressly incorporates the concept of modification. 

North Carolina a little less expressly incorporates the 

entirety of the regulatory scheme under title 50 -- under 

part 51 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It looks like -- I went 

back and read the Puerto Rico cement case. And it 

certainly looks as if -- though the issue was somewhat 

different. It looks as if the interpretation that the 

EPA is taking there is not consistent with what you are 

reading now and is consistent with what they're saying 

today. And that was in 1988-89, I guess. They must have 

been starting on that in '87. So it seemed to me we have a 

mixed bag. Some people were saying the one thing. Some 

people were saying the other thing. And the later in time 

seems to be the Puerto Rico cement. And that was at 

least 17 years ago. And --

MR. PHILLIPS: Well, Justice Breyer, I think 

Puerto Rico cement is a somewhat complicated problem. 

Because what you are dealing with there is the 

elimination of two existing units, the two kilns, and a

replacement with a brand-new unit, which would have been 

a modification under any -- I think under anybody's 

theory, because there would have been an increase in the 

hourly emissions anyway. So it would have been a NSPS 

subject to the PSD. It didn't get analyzed that way but 

the truth is it would have been fully -- the way that 

decision came out would have been exactly 

consistent with the way that they analyzed it.

 JUSTICE BREYER: The analysis which was 

probably pretty much based on what they said, I think 

was that the reason there was increased potential here 

to pollute, was really because this change would permit 

the plant to be run more intensively or more hours, 

something like that.

 MR. PHILLIPS: But that was based on the 

question of involving you know, normal operations or 

non-normal operations. The Court really didn't have to 

address -- and I don't think did address the question of 

how do you relate --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, we didn't address it. 

I'm not taking it as evidence of that. I'm taking it as 

evidence that the EPA then had a basic position similar 

to what they have now.

 That's what I'm using it as a basis for 

thinking that they were not saying to have a change, the

word "change" includes only a change in physical 

facilities that increases the amount of emission per 

hour. Am I right? Or --

MR. PHILLIPS: I don't think they were 

really arguing that particular point. I mean, that's 

not the way I would have read the argument that EPA was 

making. But, and the bottom line is they didn't address 

this issue in WEPCO. To the extent they came close to 

addressing this issue in WEPCO they lost it in the 

Seventh Circuit because WEPCO adopted an interpretation 

that's much closer to what we are asking for.

 The answer given on the other side at this 

point, that we should have -- we should have sought a 

determination. Well, the problem with that, of course, 

is every one of these projects was being inspected. The 

record is replete with examples from North Carolina and 

South Carolina and EPA inspectors on site looking at 

every one of these projects.

 JUSTICE BREYER: So then they'll say your 

argument here, even if you are right, I think they think 

you're wrong -- but even if you're right, they'll say 

well, that's an argument that it is arbitrary, capricious 

abuse of discretion for them to change horses in the 

middle of the stream, i.e., for them to take an 

interpretation of a reg that was longstanding and without

foreseeable that the agency might take the 

unfavorable position, you then must challenge it in the 

D.C. Circuit?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I think that's exactly what 

they have to be arguing. And it seems to me that that 

cannot be what 307(b)(1) means. Justice Kennedy, you 

asked a great question. Should we have raised this in 

1980, 1992, 2000? When were we supposed to bring this 

up? And the truth is in 1980 we interpreted this 

statute, the regulation, exactly the same way EPA did. 

It would have been silly for us to raise that. It is 

true that this issue comes up 25 years later in a 

bizarre proceeding. But that's not what 307(b)(2) is 

all about. It says you are precluded from making a 

challenge in an enforcement action if the action of the 

administrator was subject to challenge. Well, the 

action of the administrator was not subject to challenge 

in 1980. And when we did have the subsequent 

rulemaking --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Just a pause, under 

your view or the Fourth Circuit's view? If you read 

Judge Tatel's opinion in New York versus EPA, he 

suggests -- suggests, he says that EPA adopted different 

interpretations of modification from the outset. And so 

if what you are saying couldn't have been challenged,

was the Fourth Circuit's view, that may not be accurate. 

But if you are saying what couldn't have been 

anticipated was the argument you actually made to the 

Fourth Circuit, that might be a different story.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. Well, I think that, that 

is precisely what we are saying. But you know, Judge 

Tatel, with all due respect to him, is dead wrong. 

Because the interpretation of modification under NSPS 

and under the regulatory PSD was identical. The 

regulations couldn't be any clearer in that regard 

because if you look at 15a of our appendix, you know, 

the modification, this is the NSPS definition -- I'm 

sorry, better go back a page. 17a. 60.14 

modification defines emission rate and the emission rate 

is expressed as kilogram per hour. So that is 

absolutely clear that that is the NSPS --

Dobbs modification.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That's the NSPS section.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That's the NSPS section. 

Then you go two pages earlier to 15a and you have the 

PSD regulatory definition, and it comes right back to 

emission rate, or the regulatory history that says the 

emission rate as used in this provides is identical --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They say that that 

provision only applies when there is no SIP. And that's

not this case.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, in the first place it 

would apply in at least South Carolina immediately 

because there is a SIP that incorporates exactly the 

same language. And second of all, the notion that this 

regulation is inoperative on one side and fully 

operative on the other side make no sense. It makes 

much more sense to recognize that modification is the 

trigger for construction which is in part 51(2) and that 

that incorporates this entire modification language.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand that. 

It seems to me each part has had different definitions 

and this definition only applies to part 52 which 

applies when there is no SIP.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Okay.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't know how you can 

say it automatically applies when there is a SIP.

 MR. PHILLIPS: The way that would apply --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Part 51, in other words.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Go back to then -- you 

have to go back to 12(a), I think it is where we talk 

about the interpretation and we get to construction. 

This is (b)(8), construction means a modification, okay, 

of an emissions unit. So that -- and modification, if it 

is undefined in title 51, right? According to 15.100,

means whatever it means under the statute. So that just 

takes you back to the statute. And this is the 

interpretation under the statute. The 52 interpretation 

is also an interpretation under the statute.

 So it is completely circular and brings you 

right back to the same definition. I agree by its terms 

it doesn't apply to 51. But going through the 

definitional provision in part 51 through the definition 

of the trigger for construction, which is modification, 

it takes you right back to the same meaning of the same 

provisions.

 So there is no difference between the two. 

And to me, it is really critical. And it seems to me 

there are sort of two points to make here. One is 

nobody on the Petitioner's side of this case answers the

when we adopted these SIPs. We realized that you are 

asking us to take on enormous burdens. And you should 

have told us that before we went down this path in the 

first place.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Phillips, before you 

get away from this section 52, because I think that is 

the best section for your case, 52.01(d), is there, is 

there any sensible reason why you would want to have a 

different definition of modification for non-SIP

situations than you would for SIP situations?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No. Absolutely not. I mean, 

you would -- you -- there is no rational --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That occurred to me when--

MR. PHILLIPS: And I have not heard the other 

side make an argument that there is a rational 

distinction between the two. And the truth is if EPA 

wanted to achieve what it thought it was achieving, that 

is to eliminate the concept of modification, what it 

should have done is two things.

 It should have -- it should have deleted 

52.01. And it should have adopted the proposed 

regulation that it didn't adopt from the 1979 regs. 

This is on page 9 of their brief. This statement is 

astonishing to me. "The term major modification serves 

as the definition of modification or modified when used 

in the act in reference to a major stationary source."

 If they had adopted that regulation in 1980, I 

wouldn't had to litigate this issue 25 years later. 

We would have litigated this question in 1980 because 

then we would have said that's flatly inconsistent with 

the statutory scheme because you're not entitled.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You're quoting page 9?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Page 9 of their reply brief.

MR. PHILLIPS: The SG's reply brief, I apologize. 

The gray brief. Where they seek to get some support for 

the idea that modification was dropped out of this 

analysis. But the truth is, that was a proposed rule 

that would have done exactly what they say that the 1980 

rule did without adopting that particular regulation.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, can I ask 

another sort of basic question? In your view, would it 

be permissible for the agency to interpret the word --

to adopt a regulatory interpretation of the -- in the 

PSD regulations of the word "modification" that was 

different from the definition it used under the new 

source regulations?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Substantively different?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Substantively different.

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, I think that would be 

impermissible

 JUSTICE STEVENS: You think the statute 

required the regulation to be identical?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I don't understand how 

it's possible that Congress says in the statute that you 

take the NSPS trigger -- remember, this is not just some 

random definition we're talking about. Construction is 

the trigger for this part of this entire regulatory 

scheme, and modification is the trigger, and say it is

 MR. PHILLIPS: My answer is no.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I thought I said that first.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's definitely no.

 MR. PHILLIPS: That's a no with some 

emphasis.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would it have been 

permissible for the agency to adopt one definition for 

10 years and then change the definition to the other 

definition for all programs?

 MR. PHILLIPS: For all of it?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I think there is plenty 

of room within that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So either definition could 

comply with the statute?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. I think as long as you 

maintain consistency between the two, there is a fair 

amount of discretion for --

JUSTICE BREYER: The obvious reason to do it 

is, I guess you have an area of the country, let's say, 

which is quite clean in the air. And there is a power

plant. And what somebody works out, which is normal, is 

demand for electricity is increasing. And so what we 

will do is we're going to take these turbines and 

system, and we're going to change it really radically. 

It doesn't produce one more particle per hour, but now 

we can run it 24 hours a day and previously we'd run it 

12 hours a day. So there's going to be twice as much 

pollution in the air. Now the whole idea of the PSD 

system is you don't have twice as much pollution in the 

air, and I guess that's why they wanted to do it.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, I think the premise of 

that is, the real question is, if Congress had meant 

that, why would Congress have adopted the same word, 

modification, as the construction trigger that existed 

in NSPS?

 JUSTICE BREYER: Because you can use the 

same word, you can apply the same word in different 

places differently, depending on what your basic object 

is in the different place. It's very hard to say what 

kind of modification might exist over here, there, the 

other place. And you put your finger on a very 

difficult question for power companies, because those 

turbines do go at different amounts of rates and so 

forth during a day, during a month, during a year, so 

it's hard for them. Therefore, you have a complex

definition.

 What's wrong with that?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Because by the time the 

statute came up for review by Congress, and the PSD 

program, the new source review, there was already a very 

extensive regulatory history about the meaning of the 

term "modification."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think what's wrong 

with it is that you could have achieved that same result 

by simply not saying that modification in one program 

has to mean the same as modification in the other. If 

you didn't say that, that would be the result. You give 

modification whatever meaning you think is reasonable 

here. You give it whatever reading you think is 

reasonable in the other place. But when you say the two 

have to be the same, it seems to me you have something 

else in mind.

 MR. PHILLIPS: And it also seems to me, 

Justice Breyer, it clearly creates an obligation on the 

part of EPA to be very explicit if it's, in fact, going 

to do what you say it's going to do. You don't go about 

saying I am going to define modification in one statute 

fundamentally different from the way I define 

modification in another statute without discussing the 

word modification.

And to put this in context, you'll remember, 

these regulations were adopted in the wake of the Alabama 

Power decision. Alabama Power didn't deal with the 

issue of modification. That wasn't before the court. 

Nobody had challenged modification's definition. The 

hourly emissions rate was a perfectly valid one. What 

the court in Alabama Power said is, you can't use this 

threshold for major modification. And then the case --

so then the matter comes back, and if EPA immediately 

adopts a new set of regulations that deal what, with 

what? Major modification, not with modification.

 And then they go through this entire 

elaborate analysis of major modification, none of which, 

candidly, do we challenge. We have no quarrel with 

their interpretation of the concept of major 

modification. If anybody does, my guess is the State 

environmental groups would.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: They make a kind of 

interesting argument, major modification is not a subset 

of modification.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yeah. And if the Solicitor, 

and if EPA had enacted the regulation that they proposed 

but didn't enact, that says major modification means 

modification, then we might have an argument there. But

baseline construction -- I mean trigger for the 

applicability of this portion of the scheme, and then 

you take that same -- and you not only do it once but 

you do it twice, and you do it in the context of an 

entire regulatory scheme that was designed to implement 

this statutorily -- or implement this before the statute 

was enacted, and you have Congress saying well, you 

didn't get that right, but you did get this right, and 

they leave this language exactly in the way it is, the 

only fair inference you can draw from that, it seems to 

me --

JUSTICE BREYER: Why? Because the language, 

I don't see anywhere in the statute where -- the words 

of modification are, it's a physical changing or change 

in a method of operation which increases the amount of 

any air pollutant. Now those words, "physical change 

which increases the amount of any air pollutant," could 

mean different things in different places.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Sure.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Where does it say in the 

statute that they can't?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Where it says in the statute 

is where it makes this specific cross-reference, because 

if all they wanted to do was get that definition, all 

they had to do was use the word modification. They

didn't have to use modification as defined --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, I want to be 

sure I understand your position. Are you saying the 

statutory text in effect says every regulation using the 

word modification must employ the same definition, or 

are you relying on a general principle that when the 

same word is used it should be used in the same way?

 MR. PHILLIPS: It's a general principle 

that --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So there's nothing in the 

statute itself that says that principle shall apply to 

this case?

 MR. PHILLIPS: No, but the general principle 

is that if the same language is used in two different 

portions, you presume they have the same meaning. When 

you go beyond that -- because otherwise, their 

interpretation rendered superfluous the specific 

cross-references to as defined in and as used in; and 

while I know some don't like the legislative history, 

the legislative history is quite clear that they had in 

mind, and regulatory history as well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Your answer is you 

are not relying simply on the general principle. It is 

not just that they used the word modification in one 

place and the word modification in the other. It's that

in the latter place, they said modification as defined 

in the first place.

 MR. PHILLIPS: It depends on which general 

principle, I suppose you're talking about. I'm not 

relying on the mere presumption. I think this is much 

stronger than the mere presumption.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But your reference of 

modification as defined elsewhere merely defines the 

scope of the statutory meaning. That's not the same as 

saying every regulation that is a modification must be 

the same no matter what the program.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I think if you read it in 

context, when you recognize that what Congress was doing 

is adopting a statutory scheme that overlays on a 

regulatory scheme that was well established with very 

specific meanings, and where Congress quite clearly 

picked and chose -- I think that's the way to say it --

from the regulatory scheme, and said we'll take these 

and not take those, and has a provision at the end --

168 says, all the regulations remain in effect until 

they get changed at some point, suggesting --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just be sure I 

understand the point. If instead of saying as defined 

in X, the second statute had merely quoted the same 

words that were in X, would your argument be the same?

MR. PHILLIPS: No. It would not be nearly 

as strong as it is. We would still have a 

presumption --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So you're saying that if 

you used the definition as defined in another statute, 

that implicitly says all regulations defining this term 

must be identical.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know if I have to go 

quite that far because I have more evidence than that in 

this particular case, because I have the fact that they 

say as used in, which suggests that it's more than just 

a definitional point. We do have a legislative history 

that seems to have in mind this regulatory background; 

and we've been told by EPA that when Congress 

incorporated modification, it really did incorporate 

that luggage, baggage as well.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: This is very helpful to 

me, because the government has accused you of abandoning 

the court of appeals approach to the case, and I think 

you're endorsing the court of appeals.

 MR. PHILLIPS: I do endorse it. The only 

question I have -- I mean, I don't think that it 

necessarily has to be -- that every word has to be 

identical in the two provisions, but I do think they 

have to be congruent. And so, that's the strong version

of our argument, and that's pretty close to where the 

Fourth Circuit was.

 The weaker version of our argument, which 

gets I think some mileage on the arbitrary and 

capricious part of the argument, is at a minimum, if 

Congress adopts as the trigger point the same word in 

two statutes, and EPA then purports to be implementing 

that statute, it has some obligation to explain how it 

is that they're doing a 180 with respect to the term 

modification. And the reason --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not just a matter of 

using the same word.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes. You're right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a matter of a statute 

which says it shall have the same meaning.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. They owe us some 

responsibility to explain, how do you not follow that 

course.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, could they have said 

that construction means both modification and then come 

up with a new word, alteration? Because the statute 

says the term construction includes modification, so 

I -- construction can be broader. Could it be an 

alteration, they would come up with a new term of art, 

and add that --

but see, the point here is if they had done that, or if 

they had done what they proposed in 1979, which is just 

to simply redefine major modification to be 

modification, then we would have taken that issue 

directly to the D.C. Circuit at that point in time.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But you do have a brief 

here. You have a brief filed in the D.C. Circuit, which 

is Brief For Industry Petitioners on Actual Emissions 

Definition.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And throughout that brief 

it refers again and again to the problem, their proposed 

reg is not taking, i.e., the potential capacity, which 

is change the machine so it puts out more per minute or 

whatever, but rather, it's using actual emissions even 

though you don't change the capacity of the machine. 

There's a whole brief on that. So you already argued 

that whole brief, that what they were doing was 

inconsistent with the statute, et cetera.

collateral estoppel, if that's the argument you're 

trying to make, Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: No. As being outside the 

statute at that time, and you did.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, you have to put that 

into context. We're talking about a matter that was 

closed for 25 years and then was reopened. And this 

argument -- and it is true, a variant of this argument 

was made. I don't think it's the full argument that 

we've made before this Court. And it was rejected by 

the D.C. Circuit. But if you're arguing that as a 

307(b) argument, my answer to that is this is still not 

action by the administrator that would trigger a 307(b) 

bar. If you're asking about collateral estoppel, my 

argument is --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. I was just thinking, 

then you're left with what you called the weak argument, 

arbitrary, capricious, et cetera, because I don't see 

how you make the stronger one, what you think is 

stronger, since you made it before, or a version of 

it before the D.C. Circuit.

 MR. PHILLIPS: Well, again, if you are 

arguing that as a matter of collateral estoppel, then --

JUSTICE BREYER: No, not collateral 

estoppel, but you know, I'd be repeating myself.

see, I don't think it -- I think if you read 307(b)(2)'s 

language, it talks about action of the administrator, 

and what action of the administrator are we, in fact, 

challenging here? Nothing. Because in our view, the 

1980 regulation quite clearly says what we want it to 

say. The only thing that's changed is that the 

preambles have interpreted the 1980. We challenged that 

and the D.C. Circuit said no, we're not going to address 

that issue. That's an issue when you get back up, when 

you get back on your enforcement action. Then you can 

complain about that aspect of it. That issue is not 

ripe. And that is exactly what we are trying to argue 

in this case. And it's a variant of what I think --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Phillips, can I go 

back for a second to the meaning in (a) includes the 

same meaning as in (b). Is it not correct under your 

view of the statute that that meaning can include either 

of the two definitions that the two regulations 

identify? So that either -- whether you start with (a) 

or the second statute, either statute includes both --

may include both alternative regulations?

me again why this isn't a 307(b) problem? You said this 

is an action by the administrator?

 MR. PHILLIPS: Right. Because there is no 

action of the administrator that we would challenge. 

The only action of the administrator was the 1980 

regulation, which we interpret as not changing 

modification. If you read 52.01(d), it clearly retains 

modification. We have no quarrel, then, with what the 

administrator did in 1980.

 Then they adopt preambles to the subsequent 

regs. We do challenge those, but the D.C. Circuit said 

we're not entitled to do that, that's got to wait for an 

enforcement action. The only thing that's left out 

there is this sort of inchoate interpretation by the 

administrator. But there's no final action by the 

administrator for us to challenge. Then the only 

question would be, do we have some obligation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can't challenge 

in the D.C. Circuit the administrator's interpretation

that led to the enforcement action?

 MR. PHILLIPS: I don't know how that's a 

final action. The filing of a complaint, as this Court 

held in Harrison, is not a final action. So that 

doesn't trigger it, and I don't know what else is out 

there for us to serve as a hook. I would think at a 

minimum the Court would want to be very, very loathe to 

jump on a expansive interpretation of 307(b) where it 

operates in a context like this as a pure gotcha. You 

adopt regulations that nobody has a quarrel with, you 

change the regulation afterwards and then you come back and 

you say you can't challenge it at this point. That just 

cannot be a sensible interpretation of that statute.

 If there are no further questions, I would 

ask the Court to affirm the Fourth Circuit. Thank you.

their non-challenge, they didn't even cite to the Fourth 

Circuit or the district court, and on their face, 

they're not -- it's not plausible that these provisions, 

which are totally nonspecific, were intended to vary the 

very detailed and specific instructions on how to 

measure an emissions increase laid out. And the 

preamble --

surely does. You have to give them that.

 MR. DONAHUE: No, I don't give them that.

 MR. DONAHUE: Because it says rate, and the 

1980 PSC regulations say that the relevant rate is tons 

per year. They use the word "rate" pervasively.

 I would also say the preamble to the rule 

makes conclusively clear that "major modification" is 

EPA's definition of the statutory term. This idea that 

EPA, it's completely inconsistent with not only --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Major -- when you say 

the statutory term, you mean "modification"?

 MR. DONAHUE: Correct.

deal. There is no sign of it, and in fact there are 

specific examples. The example cited at page 23 of the 

government's opening brief in the preamble is a PSD 

major modification that would not be an NSPS --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's a tough sell, 

isn't it? I mean, the idea is you propose regulations 

saying major modification means modification. Those 

regulations are not adopted, and then the industry is 

supposed to be on notice that that's still what you 

mean?

 MR. DONAHUE: I think that there's no other 

reading of what EPA meant from the regulations. No one 

was confused by this, Chief Justice Roberts. No one was 

confused.

 This argument, it's a new argument in this 

Court about how to read the rules, the 30 -- 52.01(d), 

51.100, and 51.166(b)(8), all uncited below. It's really 

not plausible. The Court would have to abandon a lot of 

very basic principles of how to interpret legal texts to 

read the rules this way, and I think Judge Poisner was 

right on that. He was right to say this is the natural 

reading of the rules.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where is "rate" defined?

I'm still troubled by 52.01(b). Where is -- you say 

"rate" is defined. Where?

 MR. DONAHUE: "Rate" is used as an annual 

rate in 51.166(b) (21) and (b)(23).

 JUSTICE SCALIA: It's not defined. You 

say it's just used that way.

 MR. DONAHUE: It's the only -- it's tons 

per year consistently.

 The other thing I would point out, as the 

Court is aware, is that 307(b) applies it bars courts in 

enforcement actions, which includes this Court. This 

case is not up on cert from the D.C. Circuit in New 

York.

 Thank you very much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, 

Mr. Donahue. The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
