 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 06-1204, Republic of the 

Philippines v. Pimentel, et al.

 Mr. Rothfeld.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 This case concerns a dispute over the 

ownership of the property, the Arelma assets, that the 

Republic of the Philippines believes were stolen by 

Ferdinand Marcos while he served as the Republic's 

president. The ownership of this property should be 

settled by the courts of the Republic. The Arelma 

assets were stolen in the Philippines, from the 

Philippine people, by their former president. The 

current dispute is between the Republic and certain of 

its citizens. There is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just didn't hear you. 

You said that this dispute should be settled by --

MR. ROTHFELD: By the courts of the 

Republic. The question of ownership of these assets we 

believe is a matter as certainty of as the first

impression should be decided in the Republic. As I say, 

the assets here were stolen in the Republic, from the 

Republic's citizens, by their president. There is 

currently a proceeding pending before the Sandiganbayan, 

the special Philippine anti-corruption court that has 

jurisdiction over matters of this sort, dealing 

specifically with the assets that are at issue here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: That's been pending how 

long?

 MR. ROTHFELD: It's been pending -- well, 

the Republic initially filed a forfeiture petition in 

1991 directed at a range of assets related to former 

president Marcos. Ultimately, after the assets were 

transferred from Switzerland to be held in escrow in the 

Philippines, the Philippine Supreme Court in 2003 issued 

a judgment relating to those assets because there was 

some doubt as to whether that judgment, some question 

about whether that judgment specifically addressed the 

Arelma assets that are at issue here, the Republic filed 

a motion before the Sandiganbayan in 2004 directed 

specifically at the assets. The motion has been pending 

since that time.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: So it's from 2004 to 

2008?

 MR. ROTHFELD: It has been, Your Honor. The

Republic -- that delay cannot be attributed to the 

Republic. The Republic has filed five motions with the 

Sandiganbayan urging it to expedite its decision. I can 

tell you that it has a -- it is a court with a very 

substantial docket. The division of the Sandiganbayan 

that's considered this, these assets, considered among 

many other cases the corruption trial of former 

President Joseph Estrada. So I don't think that the 

delay can at this point be deemed --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, it gets way ahead of 

the analysis and probably way ahead of your argument. 

At some point I'd like you to address whether or not one 

of the equities the Court can consider is the likelihood 

of an earlier decision. Let's assume we project out 

another 10 years. Does that make a difference? That 

may come toward the end of your argument rather than 

now, but I'd like it addressed at some point.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I certainly will, Your 

Honor. I think it would make sense logically to 

consider the issues that we think -- there really are 

two related sets of considerations that should go into 

the Court's decision as to whether this suit should be 

dismissed, which is our submission. One relates to the 

Republic's sovereign immunity. The second relates to 

kind of a broader set of considerations and I think that

your question goes to those.

 So I'll turn first to the sovereign immunity 

question. The Republic asserts ownership of these 

assets. Its, its submission is that President Marcos 

misappropriated them while he served as the president of 

the Republic. If that is true, then under Philippine 

law these assets at all times were the property of the 

Republic.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rothfeld, will you 

explain then how it was that the Philippine Government 

supported the litigation against Marcos that led to the, 

what was it, the $2 billion judgment?

 MR. ROTHFELD: That's right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Said that it had no 

objection to that suit. In fact, he thought it was a 

good thing for the Philippines that that litigation go 

forward. But if the government's position is the 

judgment would be uncollectible because all of those 

assets belonged to the Philippine Government and not to 

Marcos's estate, so the -- that whole litigation would 

have been an exercise in futility.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think not, Justice 

Ginsburg, and I think that there is in fact no 

inconsistency at all. The Republic's position at that 

time was that it had no objection to plaintiffs who were

victims of the Marcos regime bringing suit in the United 

States and they had no -- the Republic had no objection 

to the suit proceeding in this country. Specifically 

the issue that was before the court that the Republic 

weighed in on was whether the act of state doctrine 

would preclude adjudication in the United States. The 

Republic's interest was in making clear that the acts of 

Marcos were not the acts of the Republic, they were not 

official acts that the Republic was prepared to defend.

 The Republic did not then and does not now 

have any objection to citizens of the Republic 

proceeding in the courts of the United States against 

the estate of Marcos. The question here is whether or 

not these assets are in the estate of Marcos. The 

Republic's submission is that these assets belong to the 

Republic, that they have never been part of the Marcos 

estate, and that therefore these are sort of ships 

passing in the night, that there can be proceedings 

against the estate in this country or elsewhere.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Is there anything else in 

the estate?

 MR. ROTHFELD: There is litigation going on 

in the Philippines now before the Sandiganbayan as to 

what is in the estate, and I think that one of the 

problems, of course, is that, as is true of many corrupt

regimes that have misappropriated state assets, 

unraveling it is enormously complicated. There were 

dummy corporations, there were smell corporations, which 

is one of the reasons that it has taken so long.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, let me ask a slightly 

different question from Justice Scalia's. Is it the 

position of the Philippine Government that there are any 

assets in the estate that the Philippine Government does 

not claim?

 MR. ROTHFELD: I think that there are some 

assets. I will not say that they are very substantial 

number of assets. Now, I should say --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Enough assets to satisfy 

the claims of the individuals who -- who brought suit in 

the United States?

 MR. ROTHFELD: No, there are not and there 

may never have been.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: So the position of the 

Philippines, going back to Justice Ginsburg's question, 

was we have no objection and in fact I think it was we 

support the litigation in the United States, but when it 

comes time to collect a judgment we're claiming they 

don't get a penny because everything belongs to us. Is 

that a fair summary of the Philippines' position?

 MR. ROTHFELD: I think that is not an

entirely fair summary, Your Honor. I think -- and 

again let me say that there are two separate questions: 

One is whether or not, as a matter of principle, the 

Philippines objected to its citizens proceeding in the 

courts of the United States to condemn the regime of 

former President Marcos.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, they weren't just 

suing to condemn the regime. They weren't asking for a 

declaratory judgment. They were asking for a judgment 

in money.

 MR. ROTHFELD: That is true, Your Honor. 

But the submission -- and the question is whether there 

is some inconsistency between what the Republic said 

then and what it says now. The submission then was not 

that the claimants were entitled to recover assets that 

belonged to the Republic. The submission was that 

whatever ended up in the Marcos estate --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but we live in a 

practical world and if in fact there were no apparent 

assets that might satisfy that judgment that the 

Philippine Government did not claim, then their -- then 

their support of the -- of the earlier litigation was at 

the very least in tension with their -- with their 

overall position.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that that --

again, I would respectfully disagree with that. I think 

that there was real meaning to the judgment that was 

returned here even if there is a dispute as to whether 

there are assets in the Marcos estate. There were two 

settlements worked out between the Marcos estate and the 

claimants, with the blessing of the Republic, that would 

have paid a very substantial amount out of assets 

recovered from the Marcos -- that were associated with 

Marcos, recovered by the Republic, and the Republic sort 

of blessed payment of those to the claimants here. 

Ultimately that was vetoed by the Sandiganbayan as 

inconsistent with Philippine law. But I think that the 

executive branch --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then why doesn't the 

Republic take the position that, because that was vetoed 

for reasons apart from the Republic's discretion, that 

the current assets would be an appropriate source of 

payment?

 MR. ROTHFELD: There have been a number of 

efforts in the Philippine Congress, and there is now 

pending bills in the Philippine Congress, to compensate 

the claimants in amounts equivalent to those 

settlements. So I think that that is something that 

could happen, but I think it's important to step back 

and say, what is the issue before this Court here? And

I think all of these considerations are simply divorced 

from the Rule 19 issues.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: There's one other point 

of Philippine law that's unclear from the briefs. The 

Respondents say they have no right to intervene in the 

proceeding that's going on before the corruption court 

and your brief suggests that there is a right to 

intervene. What is it? Can they become part of that 

litigation or will they not be heard by the corruption 

court?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, we quoted the relevant 

portion of Philippine law, which is equivalent to our 

permissive intervention, which would have permitted the 

claimants to seek to intervene in the proceeding of the 

Sandiganbayan. In fact --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Seek to intervene, but no 

right to intervene?

 MR. ROTHFELD: It is not a matter of right; 

it is permissive intervention.

 I think it's important to bear in mind the 

status of the claimants, though, because they're --

their rights are entirely derivative of the Marcos 

estate. They don't claim the Arelma assets, which are 

the subject of this here before this Court. If the 

Marcos estate is held to have no right to those assets,

they have no right at all and they have no rights to be 

protected.

 So I think it's -- it is important to 

retreat to the questions that are actually before this 

Court now about the meaning of Rule 19 and its 

application in a situation in which there is an absent 

sovereign that has asserted its sovereign immunity. And 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could you address that? 

That is the issue. Sovereign immunity, is this a 

question of where a party is just entitled to plead 

inconsistent theories? Was this a special appearance? 

Why is it that the Philippines can come into court and 

say, "we have sovereign immunity, and therefore the suit 

must be dismissed"? Would you just address that basic 

point?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think that that's --

sovereign immunity and dismissal under Rule 19 are two 

different but closely related and essential aspects of 

the relief of the Republic. As a matter of the 

sovereign immunity, all agree at this point that it 

cannot be forced to appear in this proceeding.

 But that relief is of little good to the 

Republic if the assets are then going to be awarded by a 

U.S. court to someone else and they are dissipated and

they're gone forever. And so it's necessary to protect 

its interest, its sovereign immunity, to make it -- to 

effectuate it -- that the action be dismissed under Rule 

19. And I think that it is something which this Court 

has recognized that when there is a sovereign that 

cannot be brought into the litigation and the 

sovereign's interests are going to be substantially 

undermined, the sovereign is an indispensable party and 

dismissal is essentially automatic. That's what should 

have happened here. That's the first mistake that the 

district court made. And I --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why couldn't -- why 

couldn't the Philippines, not having been a party in 

this action, pursued whoever did get the assets from 

this action --

MR. ROTHFELD: Well --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- in normal 

litigation, if they objected to the resolution.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, let me amend your 

question in one respect. They were a party and of 

course as in their -- in their capacity as a party, they 

sought dismissal under Rule 19 as well as dismissal of 

themselves on sovereign immunity grounds. But to answer 

specifically --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I guess they weren't

there for the adjudication on the merits.

 MR. ROTHFELD: They were not there for the 

adjudication of the merits, that's right, because they 

had asserted their sovereign immunity.

 I think that there -- everyone agrees, the 

Ninth Circuit itself acknowledged, that once the assets 

here are disbursed to Respondent and to the plaintiff 

class, as a practical matter they will be beyond 

recapture. There is a class of almost 10,000 people. 

And when the assets are gone, to reclaim them, even if 

the Sandiganbayan rules next week that Arelma is now and 

always has been the property of the Republic, it will be 

as a practical matter impossible to get them back.

 One suggestion which is made by Respondent 

and by some of its amici is that, because the Republic 

is not bound here, it could bring an action against the 

former stakeholder of these assets, Merrill Lynch. 

That, I think, is also clearly an inadequate remedy for 

the Republic. There is no guarantee that it would be 

able to proceed in such a proceeding sort of 

unencumbered by the judgment here. And if what we are 

looking for under Rule 19 -- again, there are sort of 

two components to this: There is the sovereign immunity 

component, which we think is essentially a per se rule 

requiring dismissal in circumstances here.

If we get beyond that and we say, under Rule 

19 what are the interests that we want to advance, the 

principal interest of Rule 19 is that everything gets 

accommodated in a single proceeding, that this gets 

resolved by the whole, as the Court has described it, 

and the only way to accomplish that is dismissal of this 

suit. If this action is dismissed, the court's judgment 

that the Republic is an indispensable party in 

litigation relating to Arelma will be binding on all the 

participants to this litigation. That will mean that if 

anybody sues the former stakeholder Merrill Lynch in the 

future, that action will be dismissed unless or until 

the Republic chooses.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Would you agree that the 

Republic is ultimately not going to be able to collect 

these funds unless it sues in the United States and 

waives its immunity in that suit? And is that -- is 

that relevant to the question of whether it should have 

been forced to proceed in this action?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I don't think it's 

directly relevant, but I think that if one looks at the 

bigger picture, it is true -- if the Republic -- if this 

action is dismissed, the Sandiganbayan rules, and let's 

say that it rules for the Republic, the Republic becomes 

the owner of Arelma. It is then in a position to go to

Merrill Lynch and say: This is our account; give it to 

us. If Merrill Lynch declines to do that, it is true 

the Republic will have to seek judicial action in the 

United States, but at that point it will be seeking to 

enforce a judgment of the Sandiganbayan. It -- the 

proceeding there will be an enforcement action. And 

having -- it being armed with that judgment and having 

the Philippine courts, which should be the ones that 

resolve this as a matter of first instance, it will be 

an entirely different kind of proceeding. And in that 

proceeding, unlike this one -- as I said, the other side 

says: Well, you know, not to worry here, because you 

could sue Merrill Lynch. But that's inconsistent with 

the purpose of Rule 19, which is to say --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, is it -- is it 

fair to the private claimants here in the United States 

to say, wait until the Philippine court renders a 

judgment in favor of the Philippines, and then they can 

come in and enforce the judgment against Merrill Lynch 

or whomever is holding the assets?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think if the 

Sandiganbayan rules for the Republic, the assets are the 

Republic's assets. The Republic can seek --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, under the 

determination of the Philippine court. But the court

here could determine that they're the private claimants' 

assets, as it did.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, it did without the 

participation of the Philippines.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, you just told 

me that the Philippines court may judge the opposite 

without the participation of the private claimants.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, but the -- but again, 

Your Honor, it's important to remember the private 

claimants have no claim to the Arelma assets. Their 

interest is entirely derivative of the Marcos estate. 

The estate --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That seems to me to 

be an argument on the merits, rather than with respect 

to which case should proceed first.

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, it goes, I think, to 

the question of whether their claim is one which is 

entitled to be heard in the United States. The question 

is, when the Sandiganbayan decides this case as between 

the two claimants that actually claim ownership of 

Arelma, as opposed to derivative rights as to one or the 

other of the claimants, that is the way in which it 

makes sense to proceed: Have the Sandiganbayan decide 

as between these two claimants, the Republic and the 

estate. Once that's done, all else follows from that.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would the private 

claimants be able to undermine the added force of the 

judgment in the Philippines, assuming a proceeding is 

brought here, on the ground that they were not allowed 

to participate in the proceeding in the Philippines?

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, I think -- I would say 

probably not, Your Honor, because again their interests 

are entirely derivative of the Marcos estate. And so I 

think they may be thought to be in privity with the 

estate, and therefore, they would not have a sort of 

separate right to challenge that. But I think that we 

should not anticipate what the future litigation will 

look like in the United States.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: In privity with the 

estate? You're suggesting that the plaintiffs would be 

connected to the Marcos family that wants to get these 

assets?

 MR. ROTHFELD: No, I do not suggest any 

connection between them. My only suggestion is that, 

because their interest is entirely derivative of the 

estate, the estate has an interest in defending its 

interest there, and therefore somebody is there 

litigating the question.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: How much of an interest 

does the estate have if it is all going to be claimed by

 MR. ROTHFELD: Well, the estate has a -- as 

I say, these assets have been moved around or hidden.  I 

think the estate may well have an interest in keeping 

them intact and saying that it does have rights.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 MR. KNEEDLER: Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court:

 When a sovereign government cannot be made a 

party to a case because of its immunity from suit, that 

fact must be given great weight in determining whether 

the suit nonetheless may proceed. That is true whether 

the absent sovereign is the United States, one of the 50 

States, an Indian tribe or, as here, a foreign state.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When you say "great 

weight," Mr. Kneedler, then you are not agreeing with 

Mr. Rothfeld, who says it's automatic?

MR. KNEEDLER: We believe it would be 

dispositive in most cases, we think, only if the 

sovereign's interests would be adequately protected by 

the judgment or in the rare case that we've identified 

in our brief where the sovereign's interests are 

adequately protected by another sovereign, in the case 

of an Indian tribe being protected by the United States.

 But other than that, or where the United 

States is in a case against a state, the United States 

being the national sovereign, there could be special 

circumstances, but we think as a whole, the -- as a 

general rule, sovereign immunity controls. And that's 

because sovereign immunity represents a fundamental 

policy judgment either rooted in the Constitution for 

the United States or the States, or judgments of the 

legislative branches that the sovereign should not be 

required to appear in court.

 A contrary rule allowing the suit to proceed 

would effectively undermine that rule of immunity and 

allow the sovereign's interest to be tried behind its 

back.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But suppose a case -- and 

you have to do a lot of supposing. Suppose that the 

Philippine Government was simply not amenable to the 

process of the court, not because of foreign immunity,

but just because it was outside the geographic area 

where process ran. It just can't be made a party. 

Exactly the same analysis as here?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I think that's probably 

correct if the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act governs 

the service of process under the Act, and if the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I understand, but in my 

hypothetical case it's just as if somebody is at the 

North Pole and you can't serve them.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Right. But if the sovereign 

-- if the foreign sovereign can't be sued, I think it's 

all the more -- I mean it can't even be reached -- it 

may be all the more reason why that interest should be 

given weight.

 We think the sovereign interest in this case 

is particularly compelling for reasons that have already 

been stated. The Government of the Philippines claims 

that it owns these assets. By contrast, the Respondents 

are unsecured judgment creditors. The Government of the 

Philippines claims it owns these, these assets, under a 

special Philippine statute dating to 1955 that declares 

ill-gotten gains gained toward -- during time in office, 

forfeit to the government, and it has a strong interest 

in having that dispute resolved in its own courts.

States strongly supports that position and that interest 

of the United States is strongly supported by the fact 

that it is a party to a mutual legal assistance treaty 

with the Philippines. Such treaties are common in this 

country. There is a comparable treaty between the 

Philippines and the Swiss Government which led to the 

repatriation from Switzerland to the Philippines of a 

large --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Kneedler, 

getting back to your previous point, why isn't the 

Philippine National -- why don't -- why doesn't the 

Philippine National Bank adequately represent the 

interest of the Republic? Under Philippine law, as I 

understand, any recovery by the bank in this case would 

be the property of the Philippines.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Because the Philippines --

excuse me. The Philippine National Bank is an escrow 

agent. It would have a conflict of interest in 

representing the interests of the Government of the 

Philippines with respect to its prior claim to the 

assets as against the Marcos estate. PNB is holding 

these assets in escrow pending the outcome of the very 

litigation we are talking about in the Philippines.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they are --

they're certainly subject to Philippine law, and I

understand that there's no dispute that under Philippine 

law the assets would be taken from the Philippine 

National Bank for the benefit of the government.

 MR. KNEEDLER: That's true, but the 

interests of the Philippine Government in obtaining --

in having its interest confirmed that it owns these 

assets as of the time of the wrongdoing going back to 

1972, that interest would not be advanced by PNB because 

PNB is holding them in escrow depending -- pending the 

outcome of that very dispute between the Marcoses and 

the Philippine Government and couldn't be expected to 

advance in this case the Government of the Philippines' 

interest or claim of ownership to those assets.

 One other international agreement I wanted 

to mention was the Convention Against Corruption, to 

which the United States is a party. And also there is a 

statute passed by Congress, 2467, that provides for 

forfeiture in the United States of assets that are 

deemed to be forfeited pursuant to a foreign proceeding. 

So international agreements --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Doesn't that depend on 

there being a foreign judgment, which we don't have in 

this case?

 MR. KNEEDLER: We -- we don't have it yet, 

but that -- that reflects the important interest of

having our courts stay their hands pending the outcome 

of the proceedings in the Philippines in which that 

would be determined.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't it also a 

requirement that in that proceeding in the foreign 

nation that all claimants would have an opportunity to 

be heard, which is not true here?

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, what -- what the 

statute requires is that the foreign proceedings be in 

accordance with due process and that parties claiming an 

-- an interest in the property be entitled to be 

present. Again, the claimants here do not claim an 

interest in the property as an owner.

 They are unsecured judgment creditors of the 

-- of the Marcos estate, and it -- it might be useful to 

think about what is true in the reverse situation, in 

the forfeiture proceeding brought by the United States 

in U.S. courts against a criminal defendant, for 

example. An unsecured creditor of the -- of the 

defendant claiming the assets is typically found not 

even to have standing to intervene. But if it does 

intervene, it would not have a claim superior to that of 

the United States because it wouldn't be a bona fide 

purchaser of the assets, and it wouldn't be without 

knowledge of the illegal conduct.

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Kneedler, may I ask 

you this question: Would the case be different if there 

were secured creditors rather than judgment creditors?

 MR. KNEEDLER: In -- in U.S. courts a 

secured creditor would get past the standing stage, but 

would not -- would not get past the bona fide purchaser 

for value without knowledge of the wrongdoing.

 In this case it has been clear since 1986, 

for example, that the Government of the Philippines has 

-- has been seeking the repatriation of Arelma and its 

assets.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it's been doing it on 

a fairly sporadic basis. If I remember the facts 

correctly, first it got a stay with respect to the 

disposition of assets, and then the stay expired and the 

government didn't do anything about it, and then the 

government didn't come into action again until this 

particular claim was raised.

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I think it --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Maybe -- let me put the --

sort of my response in the form of a question. In 

drawing or refusing to draw the conclusion of 

"indispensable party," do you claim that a court may or 

may not consider the equitable or inequitable behavior 

of the government?

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I -- perhaps in an 

extreme case, but I -- first of all, I think the courts 

of the United States should be very reluctant to deem a 

foreign government's conduct inequitable in the sense 

that you're describing it. And I think, for the reasons 

Mr. Rothfeld said, repatriating these assets is an 

extremely complicated thing. But the Philippines 

Government sought these assets in -- beginning in 1986, 

obtained a freeze order in 1986, again in 1990. It got 

a final determination by the district attorney in 

Switzerland in 1995, confirmed by the federal court of 

Switzerland in 1997, that the assets could be returned. 

These assets, the shares, the Arelma shares, however, 

were not actually returned until 2000 by the Swiss 

Government.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there any explanation 

why the freeze that was imposed by a U.S. court in 1987 

was simply allowed to lapse?

 MR. KNEEDLER: That was the preliminary 

injunction and I'm not sure what happened after that. 

But I did want -- the proceedings in Switzerland, I did 

want to make clear, because there was a suggestion that 

the Philippine Government was duplicitous by encouraging 

this suit and at the same time seeking the assets. But 

as I just pointed out. It has been clear since 1986 and

through a whole series of proceedings in Switzerland and 

in the Philippines that the Government of the 

Philippines has been claiming all of the Marcos assets, 

specifically including the Arelma assets --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe --

MR. KNEEDLER: -- from the very beginning.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, maybe they have been 

have been candid about their claims, but they -- in 

real-world practical terms, the claim to these assets 

and the representation at the same time that it's 

appropriate for these people to proceed in the United 

States for a money judgment, are at least in some 

tension with each other, aren't they?

 MR. KNEEDLER: I do not believe so. If we 

thought about an analogy at the United States, if the 

United States filed a brief in this Court saying that a 

former Government official could be sued, did not have 

qualified immunity and could be sued in his personal 

capacity, or didn't -- or could be sued individually and 

the Westfall Act did not protect him, that would in no 

way make -- be a representation by the United States 

that a judgment against that officer could be satisfied 

out of assets of the United States, including assets 

that the United States might be seeking to recover 

from -- from the defendant.

And we think the Philippine Government is in

liability in this case -- the judgment does constitute a 

finding of liability so that with respect to -- it would 

give these Respondents here the ability to go to 

Philippine court, to file a claim in the probate

serves the Respondents' interests to a great extent.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. SWIFT

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. SWIFT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 I would like to address as a first point the 

issue you raise, which is perhaps seminal to you, and 

that is whether there is an adequate alternative remedy 

to the human rights victims, either in the United States 

or in the Philippines. Our answer is, unequivocally, 

there is no remedy.

 Let me talk about the Philippines first. 

Any forfeiture proceeding in the Philippines is in rem. 

Its supreme court has so declared. These assets are in

the United States. There cannot be two jurisdictions 

that share in rem assets.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, doesn't the -- maybe 

this makes no difference, but doesn't the Philippine 

National Bank have the -- whatever they call them, the 

share certificates or stock certificates that represent 

the Arelma assets at this point?

 MR. SWIFT: That's right. Switzerland 

confiscated those certificates from a Swiss financier 

and transferred them to the Philippines.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Couldn't they --

couldn't they bring an in rem in the Philippines based 

on the presence in the Philippines of those two 

certificates?

 MR. SWIFT: They can, and that's in fact 

what is occurring.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. SWIFT: However, it's also apparent from 

the facts in this case that those certificates were 

never the property of the Philippine Government, never, 

ever. There is absolute clear evidence in this record, 

in the joint appendix on that, which makes the whole 

issue --

JUSTICE BREYER: I thought the issue in the 

Philippines is the question of whether the money that

went into the stock certificates eventually belonged to 

the people of the Philippines from the beginning or 

belonged to Marcos personally?

 MR. SWIFT: Well, that's --

JUSTICE BREYER: And you're saying that 

there's no possibility whatsoever that a Philippine 

court could say that this money initially belonged to 

the people of the Philippines?

 MR. SWIFT: They could not say that in a 

forfeiture proceeding because --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm saying whether they --

I don't care what the name of the proceeding is. I'm 

saying could they decide that?

 MR. SWIFT: Yes, sir, absolutely.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. Now, if they 

decide that, why should your clients, terribly treated 

as they were, get the money ahead of the victims in the 

Philippines, who also were terribly treated?

 MR. SWIFT: Because the judgment in the 

Philippines would not be in rem, Mr. Justice Breyer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: I thought Justice Souter 

just answered that. He said that the stock certificates 

might be held to belong to the people of the 

Philippines, in which case the stock certificates 

represent stock in a company that has a claim against

Merrill Lynch, and so they will say, this certificate 

belongs to the people of the Philippines; the people of 

the Philippines would like you, Merrill Lynch, to pay 

back the money that the company gave them initially. 

And Merrill Lynch I imagine would pay it. Now that I 

think is as I understand it. Is there something wrong 

with my understanding?

 MR. SWIFT: I think your understanding is 

correct in that regard; however, the law both in the 

Philippines and in the United States draws a clear 

distinction between the ownership of stock and a 

corporation's ownership of assets. Certainly Dole v. 

Patrickson stands for that proposition.

 The -- a judgment rendered as to the 

certificates in the Philippines or even as to the assets 

would not be in rem. So if that judgment came over to 

the United States to be enforced, they would stand in 

the same position as any other judgment creditor, not a 

judgment creditor with a claim to specific assets, but a 

judgment creditor as to a specific amount of money.

 Let me answer another question which was 

asked --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I would like you to 

address -- you seem to put heavy weight on this in rem 

characterization. That is a judgment there's a thing.

But our law over the years has come to appreciate that 

things do not have rights; people have rights in things. 

So we have modified the once rigid notion that the suit 

is against a thing, to recognize that it's people's 

rights in the thing that count. And your use of that 

label seems to forget about all the more recent 

understanding.

 MR. SWIFT: Justice Ginsburg, I believe 

interpleader is, statutory interpleader, is an in rem 

nature of a proceeding. In fact, it was the best and 

most appropriate and the only proceeding in which all 

claimants could be -- their claims could be heard. It's 

a shame that the Philippine Government didn't come in, 

as it did in twelve other cases it brought in the United 

States, including two interpleaders, to say: Yes and 

this is our evidence. What it suggests is that they had 

no evidence to support it, and they want to be in their 

own court. Why do they want to be in their own court? 

Because it won't be defended by the Marcoses. And the 

very rule that they cited in their reply brief -- and by 

the way, the reply brief was the first time in all this 

litigation they have ever asserted that the human rights 

victims have a remedy by intervening in the 

Sandiganbayan in the Philippines. We don't. The rule 

that they quote says as to assets in the court.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Did -- did the district 

court in Hawaii or the Ninth Circuit ever decide what 

the Petitioners tell us is the basic question, that is 

do these assets belong to the Philippine Government 

under that 1955 statute, or do they belong to the Marcos 

estate? It seemed to me that our courts were just 

assuming that the assets belonged to the Marcos estate 

and that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit were creditors of 

the Marcos estate.

 MR. SWIFT: Your Honor is correct that there 

was an underlying belief by the court, that the court 

accepted as valid the Republic's claim that it owned the 

assets, the assets were stolen. But the evidence in the 

case, and the two lower courts specifically found on the 

basis of that evidence, that these were Marcos assets; 

and this finding was made after the completion of 

discovery, after a deposition in -- in France.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But it didn't say, find, 

that: And they belong to the Marcos estate and not the 

Philippine Government.

 MR. SWIFT: Not the latter part of your 

equation. They did not say that they did not belong to 

the Philippine Government. By saying they belonged to 

Ferdinand Marcos it was sufficient, it was sufficient 

evidence.

JUSTICE BREYER: I didn't see that finding 

in the court of appeals decision. I thought the court 

of appeals thought that they belonged -- they couldn't 

possibly belong to the Philippine Government or the 

people there, because there is no way that the 

Philippine Government could win in a suit in New York in 

trying to recover them. But the Solicitor General has 

provided about two or three ways, in which and so -- and 

so have the Petitioners -- and that seems to me the 

heart of the issue. They have said: No, no, there are 

two or three ways in which the Philippine Government 

might well -- it might well ask a court for the money 

and the court would say, yes, you're entitled to it.

 So that it seems to me, that's the heart of 

it. What is your response to that?

 MR. SWIFT: I'd like to go through each way 

in which they say they can and convince you that they 

can't. First, they could proceed in a forfeiture 

proceeding in the Philippines. But of course that 

wouldn't be in rem, so they couldn't get to first base 

as to the assets. As to the share certificates, yes, 

but of course that in effect is a nullity because they 

never belonged to the Philippine Government. That 

aside, we put aside that factual --

your last step. If it's an in rem proceeding against 

the share certificates what -- what difference does it 

make whether they ever belonged to the Philippines?

 MR. SWIFT: Because ownership of the share 

certificates is not a right to the assets, a per se 

right. There would have to be some additional rights. 

The assets are ones --

JUSTICE SOUTER: So you're saying an in rem 

proceeding against the certificates simply will not 

resolve the issue; that's the -- that's the guts of the 

answer.

 MR. SWIFT: That's correct. The other two, 

two types of proceedings, one could be a conversion and 

one breach of contract, both of which would be barred by 

statute of limitations.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, well, that isn't what 

they say. I think, if I understand it, that they say 

that were the share certificates in the hands of the 

Philippine Government on the ground, that the money used 

to create those had been taken from the Philippine 

people unlawfully, if that's what they decide, at that 

point the owner of the certificates, the government, 

would say to Merrill Lynch: We own the company, the 

company has the assets; please send us the money. And 

Merrill Lynch would do it.

left out was that in the year 2000, when the Philippine 

Government through PNB controlled the Arelma 

certificates, a request to Merrill Lynch was made. The 

request was refused. So if there was a breach it 

occurred in the year 2000. Remember, after the 

certificates were transferred from Switzerland to the 

Philippines the PNB then created a new board of 

directors and they went directly to Merrill Lynch.

 The whole point of this exercise was, of 

course, to circumvent the courts of the United States. 

I only learned about the assets in the year 2000 and 

then proceeded to try to recover them.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But may I ask you this 

question, though. Merrill Lynch refused in the year 

2000, but if the proceeding that Justice Breyer has just 

been describing takes place and there is a judgment to 

the effect that the share certificates are properly held

or the property of the Philippine Government, and the 

Philippine Government now makes, or then, makes a new 

request to Merrill Lynch, the fact that they made a 

request that was refused in 2000, which may be too late 

to sue on, isn't going to prevent them from suing on 

their present adjudication that they are the true owners 

of the share certificates and want the money.

 MR. SWIFT: But I believe there is an 

important part of the equation that's left out of that 

question, and that is the rights of the Philippine 

government as the new shareholder will not be any 

greater than those of the prior shareholder. The prior 

shareholder made a demand and did not receive the money.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. You're saying -- I 

think you're saying that the demand would be ineffectual 

this time for the same reason it was ineffectual the 

last time.

 MR. SWIFT: Yes, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: And the suggestion I 

thought that Justice Breyer had made and that I made was 

this time they can do something further. They can take 

the judgment and go into a United States court and say: 

We've got this judgment, there's no question that these 

shares and what they represent are ours; so make Merrill 

Lynch give us the money. What prevents them from doing

that?

 MR. SWIFT: Nothing prevents them from 

making the demand. But when they go into court and ask 

for that, first of all, Merrill Lynch can do what it did 

here, which is to file an interpleader and say: We want 

all the claimants to come forth and make the claim. 

Then we have a redo.

 What we have below is a judgment, a judgment 

that we're seeking to enforce and we contend that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the difference in 

the redo is that in the second case that's just been 

hypothesized, the Philippine government is represented. 

We are making these assumptions, and the Philippines 

government says: You can make these assumptions, but 

they may very well be wrong; we want to be represented 

before you make those assumptions.

 MR. SWIFT: Well, they had that right in the 

year 2000 when they chose to exercise their sovereign 

immunity. So, what has changed? They would have to 

waive their sovereign immunity to go --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Any party that's beyond 

the process of the court has a right to come in. The 

question is what happens if they are not there.

 MR. SWIFT: Well, they were brought in. 

They chose to exit. They then paid for the prosecution

of claims by PNB and Arelma, in effect acting as 

surrogate, reflective of a question that was asked 

earlier. Then when they were dissatisfied with the 

result, they then want to use PNB and Arelma to upset 

that pursuant to a Rule 19(b) motion.

 JUSTICE BREYER: There is a huge change. 

The change would be that they'd a judgment of that 

special court over there that this company and the 

assets understandably belong to us, not to the Marcoses. 

And so this time, they go with that judgment to Merrill 

Lynch and say: Give us the money.

 And if they -- if they don't -- if Merrill 

Lynch says no -- Merrill Lynch might say yes, but you'll 

say, no, it belongs to us, so they might not. And if 

they don't, then the Philippines are never going to get 

the money, unless they bring the lawsuit. And once they 

bring the lawsuit, then you have them, because then you 

go right into the court in that lawsuit and intervene 

and they have waived all their sovereign immunity, et 

cetera, they can't get the money.

 MR. SWIFT: Then you have a redo of what 

they started out this proceeding doing --

JUSTICE BREYER: With a difference.

 MR. SWIFT: -- which was judge shopping and 

forum shopping. They were -- they were --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But isn't that what --

that's what sovereign immunity means. I mean, they do 

have the right to pick their forum. You say I can only 

be sued when I consent, so I can consent where I will.

 The problem with what you're presenting is 

it sounds like, yes, you have sovereign immunity, you 

don't have to be part of this lawsuit and it can't 

affect your rights, but then when it seems to be 

eventual judgment, it's a default judgment effectively 

against the Philippines, because they can never get 

those assets once they're disbursed. So, it's a -- it's 

kind of a deceptive immunity, because by asserting the 

immunity they are going to lose their opportunity to 

claim these assets.

 MR. SWIFT: Well, what Your Honor is 

suggesting is that there should be a per se rule under 

Rule 19(b). I don't believe it's the role of this Court 

to change Rule 19(b).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Not necessarily. I'm 

focusing on this situation. There could be others.

 MR. SWIFT: Well, then we have two lower 

courts that have balanced and weighed all appropriate 

factors. There is no suggesting that there are other 

factors. They -- I believe that the standard of review 

for this Court is whether or not the lower courts

considered the factors and engaged in an appropriate 

balancing and weighing --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: In making that balancing, 

what weight did they give to the sovereign immunity of 

the Philippines?

 MR. SWIFT: Significant weight. The Ninth 

Circuit said it was a powerful factor. And then it went 

into other factors, some of which Justice Ginsburg 

mentioned: The 22-year delay. They have known about 

this for a long time.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: I thought that the Ninth 

Circuit went on a statute of limitations in New York. 

It didn't give the sovereign immunity claim, it seems, 

in the end of the day any weight, because it says we 

don't have to worry about the Philippines being out of 

this case because they would have no claim on the 

merits.

 MR. SWIFT: Let me pose a different example 

to you, Justice Ginsburg, and that is, what if this were 

a bankruptcy proceeding and the foreign sovereign said: 

Oh, those assets really belong to us, they were stolen, 

and we'll decide that in our country.

 Now, it could be any country of the world. 

Would the U.S. court stand for that? Are U.S. courts 

supposed to give away and surrender and be ousted of

their own jurisdiction in in rem actions and farm out 

decisions to foreign countries? And in our case we're 

not even going to be represented, nor will the Marcoses?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So there might be a 

different situation in your hypothetical with respect to 

bankruptcy. In effect, there's an administrator against 

whom the Philippines could proceed, unlike the situation 

here, where you have a class and which the prospect of 

the Philippines proceeding later is not realistic.

 MR. SWIFT: Well, I submit that the 

underlying principle is a solid one, and that is U.S. 

courts do have in rem jurisdiction. We have 28 U.S.C. 

1655. It's one of the oldest forms of jurisdiction we 

have in this country. And we should not be surrendering 

that to a foreign sovereign and farming out per decision 

decisions about assets. These assets are not 

transitory. They have been here 35 years.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but may I ask a sort 

of -- maybe it's too elementary a question, but has any 

court ever decided the merits of the question whether 

the Marcos estate or the Philippine Government owns 

these assets?

 MR. SWIFT: The lower court -- well, not as

remedy, I understand that. But has it decided the 

merits of the basic dispute?

 MR. SWIFT: It has, based on evidence, based 

on depositions, that these assets belonged to Marcos.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is that? Then why 

were they bothering with the statute of limitations? 

Both courts said that the action would be time barred in 

New York. But if they made a definitive ruling that the 

assets belonged to the Marcos estate and not the 

Philippine Government, then that would be preclusive.

 MR. SWIFT: I -- are you saying that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I just did not find in 

either the district court or the court of appeals an 

answer to that basic question: Whose assets are they? 

It seemed to me they were assuming the assets belonged 

to the estate and not to the Philippine Government, but 

they made no specific finding on that issue.

 MR. SWIFT: There are a number of findings, 

but obviously, because the Philippine Government was not 

a party in the case, there was no finding specific to 

the Philippine Government. But the finding that they 

were -- belonged to Ferdinand Marcos is sufficient. You 

do not need the counter-finding that they did not belong 

to the Republic.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But then you're ignoring

a 1955 law that says anything that belongs to Marcos 

that he didn't get legitimately belongs to the 

government.

 MR. SWIFT: Well, again, that's a forfeiture 

issue. The assets have to be in the Philippines, and 

there have been many forfeiture proceedings in the 

Philippines as to Marcos assets.

 To answer a question Justice Kennedy raised 

earlier, aren't there other assets, they've have already 

recovered over a billion dollars of assets. There is 

still hundreds of millions, if not a billion, in the 

Philippines.

 You know, from the record and what I've 

submitted, that we're not able to transfer our American 

judgment to the Philippines. The United Nations Human 

Rights Committee has even found a violation of 

international law by the Republic in preventing us from 

doing that. We've had to go to that body. Do we think 

that we are going to get justice in a Philippine court 

that's never adjudicated human rights violation, much 

less our right to the assets? Think how easy it would 

be for the Marcoses and the Philippine Government to 

simply make a deal as to these assets.

issues that could be addressed when the Philippines

attempt to enforce a judgment they would get in the 

Philippines if they do in fact get such a judgment?

 MR. SWIFT: Well, then we run into such 

issues like the act of state doctrine. And we have --

then we will -- our defense will be undermined because 

they will say a U.S. court cannot re-examine those --

that determination. So it's a catch-22 for us. We 

proceeded as we were --

JUSTICE BREYER: Do you have -- I mean I 

don't see you have a claim there as opposed to the --

the worst that would happen, not necessarily good for 

your clients, but the worst that would happen would be 

that the assets would be devoted to victims and their 

families in the Philippines. I mean, namely to the 

Philippine people. So I don't see some kind of 

fundamental unfairness here, unless you can point one 

out.

 MR. SWIFT: Well, I --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean they'll treat you 

like another creditor and you have -- but is there some 

terrible unfairness going on?

 MR. SWIFT: What Your Honor is suggesting is 

that a useful approach to this case is to say, well, if 

the Philippine Government gets the money, then won't 

that benefit everybody? Well, then you have to look at

the characteristic of the country, something I'm very 

familiar with but which I don't want to -- I think it 

would be inappropriate in this proceeding to talk about.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there -- is there 

something special going on, specially unfair, in respect 

to the delays where you are treated differently than 

other litigants in the Philippines?

 MR. SWIFT: Yes. There was purposeful delay 

in us being able to transfer our judgment. We are just 

in the pleadings stage after 11 years there.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Counsel, what does 

unfairness have to do with it? I mean the whole 

doctrine of sovereign immunity rests upon unfairness. 

It says you can't sue the sovereign even if you have a 

valid claim. And when we say we will apply the same 

doctrine as to foreign sovereigns, it means the same 

thing. I'm just not terribly persuaded by the fact that 

it has unfair consequences. The doctrine of sovereign 

immunity always has unfair consequences. So, unless 

you're asking us to abandon the doctrine, the fairness 

argument does not persuade me.

 MR. SWIFT: Well, I think the issue was 

resolved pursuant to 19(b). Unless this Court 

determines that there is a per se rule under 19(b), we 

weigh factors, and it's the role of this Court to

determine whether or not there was -- the lower courts 

did not make a decision based on equity and good 

conscience, one of the broadest parameters of 

decisionmaking provided by a lower court.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: May I go back on exactly 

that point on the equity to Justice Breyer's last 

question? I thought you had given or anticipated his 

question in something you said a moment ago, and then 

you didn't repeat it, and I may have misunderstood you. 

I thought you had told us that the courts of the 

Philippines did not recognize, for enforcement purposes 

there, the judgment that your clients had obtained in 

the United States, and that in effect they, therefore, 

if they were going to make a claim on assets in the 

Philippines, they would have to start from scratch 

again. Is that correct? Did I misunderstand you?

 MR. SWIFT: Well, our judgment has not been 

enforced. They asked -- initially asked for a filing 

fee of $8.4 million. We appealed that, after eight 

years and some months. They finally said, yes, the 

filing fee is $10. So, it was sent back down where 

there was still more delay. I mean, I'm a realist. I 

mean, how many years is it going to take?

 JUSTICE ALITO: -- trying to recognize it?

 MR. SWIFT: And the U.N. -- the United 

Nations Human Rights Committee has so found.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Let me ask you this: Did 

the Philippine Government formally take a position in 

raising these obstructive barriers, the $8 million 

filing fee, for example?

 MR. SWIFT: It did not.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. That was sua sponte 

with the court?

 MR. SWIFT: It was sua sponte with the --

actually raised with the Marcoses initially, and the 

court simply said yes, it's $8.4 million.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't that -- I mean it 

sounds shocking, but I thought that in the Philippines, 

as in many countries, the filing fee is determined by 

what you're asking for. So it would be a percentage of 

$2 billion. And if they just did that automatically, 

then you say, oh, but, but this -- the filing fee of 

that size would mean that the Plaintiffs can't sue. But 

that's -- but it wasn't they picked whatever figure, 

filing fee, out of a hat; it was a percentage of what 

was sought in the litigation right?

analysis. The -- except there was another provision of 

the fee statute which we went under and which they 

ultimately -- the Philippine Supreme Court said that we 

were correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Counsel, before you 

sit down, you haven't mentioned anything about your 

argument that the Philippines don't have the right to 

raise this. Are you throwing in the towel on that one?

 MR. SWIFT: Absolutely not. We think that 

argument is definitive. First, on one hand, with regard 

to the Philippine Government and its PCGG: They were 

not parties to the judgment. Therefore under Karcher, 

Marino, Devlin --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, the 

Philippines National Bank and Arelma were, and of course 

they've appealed. And I understand the law to be they 

can raise these arguments. We don't have need to have 

an independent basis for the Philippines.

 MR. SWIFT: That's true, but we've also 

pointed out that Arelma and PNB have thrown in the towel 

as to the merits. Remember, they're parties that are 

separate parties. They had claims on the merits. Their 

claims were resolved against them inter se, and so they 

no longer have a dog in the fight.

they are able to successfully knock out the judgment, 

then they are back to square one. Then they -- they 

lost on the merits, but that judgment would be wiped 

out.

 MR. SWIFT: Well, perhaps under Rule 19(b) 

the lower court may still rule that there is a -- a 

definitive judgment as to them against other creditors. 

And in fact that -- there has been --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If there was no authority 

of the court to proceed, then the judgment is -- is as 

though it were never made.

 MR. SWIFT: Well, that's perhaps one way of 

looking at it, Justice Ginsburg. I submit to you that 

the -- the decision I would respectfully request you 

look at is Horizon Bank and Trust Company versus 

Massachusetts, where the same facts occurred. The First 

Circuit -- Massachusetts did the same thing the Republic 

of the Philippines did here. It did the two-step dance: 

We're sovereign, we're indispensable. It was denied by 

the lower court. The lower court then, since the United 

States was a party and the State didn't have immunity as 

to that, it went into the merits determination. 

Massachusetts appealed only appealed only the 19(b) 

decision. And the Court of Appeals held that because 

they had not appealed the merits decision, the same as

here, therefore, there was no longer a live controversy, 

and live controversy is a requirement of standing in 

this Court, or power to appeal in this Court.

 So, in addition, although there isn't a lot 

of case law in this Court on this particular point, I 

would refer you to the Ashcroft v. Mattis decision 

because the same principle was applied there where there 

was no appeal permitted to this Court. Finally, the 

one thing that I have not really addressed is Merrill 

Lynch's interest. The whole nature of "interpleader" is 

that the stakeholder should have an adequate remedy. 

Merrill Lynch has significant business interests, as do 

many banks, many insurance companies, in getting a 

resolution. This matter, in itself, has gone on for 

eight years. There have been over a dozen appeals in 

this particular piece of litigation.

 Doesn't -- isn't there a significant 

business interest that has to be weighed in that 

equation so that Merrill Lynch -- only a stakeholder 

will continue to have to defend, defend, defend, 

interplead and so forth?

 I submit to you that there is a policy 

judgment that has to be made by this Court as to the 

rules with regard to interpleader and in rem proceedings 

and whether this Court is prepared to surrender

jurisdiction to foreign courts to make --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: If -- if the proceeding 

can't go forward because of sovereign immunity, that 

judgment would shield Merrill Lynch from any other 

claim. It could say to any other claimant: Sorry, a 

binding judgment has been issued saying this matter 

can't be settled without the Philippines being in it. 

So I don't really get your: Merrill Lynch is going to 

be subject to repeated proceedings. They will be armed 

with a judgment that says, suit can't go on without the 

Philippines being there.

 MR. SWIFT: Well, let me -- let me take you 

on, on that point. We have one other remedy, and that 

is execution. Execution doesn't require joinder of all 

parties. It's a singular proceeding that people can 

join in, but we would have the right to execute, and you 

can bet that that is exactly what we will do.

 So, to some extent, what is being argued 

here is somewhat besides the point because if that money 

goes back to Merrill Lynch, we can, and will, execute on 

that.

MR. ROTHFELD: Thank you, Your Honor.

 A couple of points. First of all, there is 

no doubt that the Republic has a substantial interest in 

the assets that are at stake here. And, therefore, its 

sovereign immunity, at least in the context of this 

case, should be dispositive and should have led to 

dismissal under Rule 19.

 There -- this Court in the Provident case 

noted that there are certain compelling, substantive 

considerations that are dispositive under Rule 19 that 

make it unnecessary to consider any other balancing 

consideration. Sovereign immunity is one such 

consideration. And because the Republic has immunity, 

has asserted immunity --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You agree that the Ninth 

Circuit gave sovereign immunity great weight in the 

balancing?

 MR. ROTHFELD: I think it gave it no weight 

at all. I think it said that, yes, in theory, sovereign 

immunity is entitled to weight. But in this case we are 

going to ignore it completely because we believe that if 

the Republic appears in New York and asserts its 

interests, it will lose under statute of limitation 

grounds. That is a completely inappropriate way of 

treating it.

Once the sovereign immunity was asserted and 

there was a substantial interest in the asset here, as 

there undoubtedly was, that should have been the end of 

the matter.

 The second point is there is no question 

that, ultimately, this is a dispute between the Marcos 

estate and the Republic. There is no question that the 

claims of the Respondents here are entirely derivative 

of the Marcos estate; and, therefore, that is something 

that has to be decided first: Whether this belongs to 

the estate, the Respondents, or the Republic. And that 

is a determination that should be made in the courts of 

the Philippines.

 It is not a question of surrendering the 

jurisdiction of U.S. courts. There is a general 

consensus that stolen assets, assets stolen by corrupt 

leaders, should be returned to the nation of origin, and 

determination as to ownership should be made by the 

courts of that nation. That's stated on the U.N. 

Convention on Corruption to which the U.S. and the 

Philippines are a party.

 All of the nations that have an interest in 

the relevant assets, not only the Republic but the 

United States and Switzerland, all agreed that it is 

appropriate for the Sandiganbayan to make that

determination as between the Republic and the estate.

 If it's ruled for the estate, the Respondent 

can attempt to collect as a judgment creditor. If it 

goes to the Republic, the Republic can assert its 

interest directly with Merrill Lynch as the owner of 

Arelma. If Merrill Lynch declines to pay, it can in a 

number of ways try to enforce its -- either with the 

assistance of the United States according to U.S. 

statute, in which case the Sandiganbayan's factual 

determinations would be dispositive, or it can bring an 

action under -- under New York law. That is the only 

way in which there could be a single proceeding that 

resolves everybody's interests.

 In this proceeding, as all agree, the 

Republic is free, for whatever it is actually worth, to 

sue Merrill Lynch. That is precisely what Rule 19 is 

designed to avoid, duplicative litigation, the 

possibility of duplicative liability.

 If the Sandiganbayan rules, the Republic 

comes here and initiates an action, everybody who has a 

claim can be brought into that action. As Justice 

Ginsburg noted, there is no possibility that Merrill 

Lynch could be subjected to duplicative liability 

because this Court's judgment would determine that the 

Republic is an indispensable party.
