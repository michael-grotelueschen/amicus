3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

4 first this morning in Case 10-788, Rehberg v. Paulk.

 Mr. Pincus. 

6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS 

7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8  MR. PINCUS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

9 and may it please the Court:

 This Court has twice held, in Malley and in 

11 Kalina, that a complaining witness who sets a criminal 

12 prosecution in motion by submitting a false affidavit is 

13 entitled to qualified immunity, but not absolute 

14 immunity, in an action under section 1983. The Court 

rested that conclusion on its determination that 

16 complaining witnesses were subject to damages liability 

17 at common law when -- in 1871 when section 1983 was 

18 enacted. 

19  The question in this case is whether the 

rule of Malley and Kalina also applies to a complaining 

21 witness who sets a prosecution in motion by testifying 

22 before a grand jury. Again, the common law provides the 

23 answer. The law is clear that in 1871 damages liability 

24 could be based on false grand jury testimony.

 JUSTICE ALITO: The problem I have with your

Official 

1 argument is that I don't really know what a complaining 

2 witness is in the grand jury context. Let's take the 

3 Federal grand jury as an example. Do you think there 

4 are complaining witnesses before Federal grand juries?

 MR. PINCUS: I think there -- there can be. 

6 It depends obviously on the -- the circumstances, Your 

7 Honor, but -- but there certainly can be. 

8  JUSTICE ALITO: A complaining witness, I 

9 would think, is a person who files a complaint, who 

causes -- so, under the Federal system, it would be 

11 someone who files a complaint and attests to it under 

12 Rule 5. That person is asking that charges be brought. 

13 That's what it means to be a complaining witness, filing 

14 a complaint.

 Nobody -- no witness before a Federal grand 

16 jury asks that an indictment be returned. They provide 

17 testimony, and they may want an indictment to be 

18 returned, but it's the prosecutor who asks for the 

19 indictment to be returned. So, I don't see how there is 

a complaining witness in that sense in the traditional 

21 grand jury context. 

22  MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, the common 

23 law confronted precisely the same situation, and after 

24 public prosecutors came into being and when grand juries 

were empaneled by them, the common law has concluded 

4

Official 

1 that, both in 1871 and in the present, that there can be 

2 a person who is the motivating force behind the 

3 prosecution, who --

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: A person? What --

what if you have three elements to a crime, and you have 

6 one witness for each one. You see somebody sees the guy 

7 trying to get into a car. Well, maybe he left it --

8 maybe he locked his keys in. Another sees the guy 

9 walking around with a television. It might be his. A 

third sees the guy selling the television to somebody 

11 else. There's nothing wrong with that. Each one 

12 testifies before the grand jury. Who is the complaining 

13 witness? 

14  MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, at common 

law, the complaining witness was more than just someone 

16 who gave evidence that was necessary for the warrant or 

17 the indictment to issue. It was someone who was pushing 

18 for the prosecution to be brought. All of these 

19 problems, of course, occurred at common law, and they 

also occur in connection with the circumstances that the 

21 Court addressed in Malley and Kalina. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you 

23 another example that I think happens with some 

24 frequency. You have a Federal grand jury, and you have 

testimony by an FBI or a DEA case agent, the person who 

5

Official 

1 has been working on the case, and that witness provides 

2 a lot of information supporting the charges that the 

3 prosecutor wants returned. You also have a cooperating 

4 witness, someone who has entered into a plea bargain 

and, in exchange for that, is providing a lot of 

6 incriminating testimony. Now, is there a complaining 

7 witness in that situation? 

8  MR. PINCUS: Well, again, Your Honor, there 

9 can be. It -- it depends --

JUSTICE ALITO: Which one is it? 

11  MR. PINCUS: It could be both. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: Both? 

13  MR. PINCUS: It could be one or -- it could 

14 be -- it could be one or the other. I think these --

these circumstances, again, are not unknown to the 

16 common law in the States. They --

17  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Pincus, you said -- I 

18 think you used the words "the one who motivated the 

19 charge" or something to that effect. And I'm looking at 

the complaint that was filed in this case, and it 

21 says -- and this is on page 28 of the joint appendix. 

22 It says Mr. Hodges -- that's the prosecutor -- knew or 

23 should have known there was no probable cause. "He," 

24 Mr. Hodges, "directed Mr. Paulk to appear before the 

grand jury and attest to the truth of such charges."

1  So, if anyone was the instigator, it was the 

2 prosecutor, not his aide. But the prosecutor gets 

3 absolute immunity. 

4  MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't 

think we know, because the complaint also alleges that 

6 Mr. Paulk knew that his testimony was false and -- and 

7 made it -- and gave his testimony anyway. And 

8 certainly, his --

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if he did it -- if he 

did at the prosecutor's bidding, then he is not the 

11 prime mover. 

12  MR. PINCUS: Well, the -- the complaint also 

13 alleges that they were conspiring together to bring this 

14 complaint. And so, again, I think the facts will be 

developed. But the -- the first indictment in fact 

16 listed Mr. Paulk as the complainant. So, in many 

17 situations, the concerns that Justice Alito was pointing 

18 to won't be present because there will be a clear 

19 complainant, as there was in this case.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: But do you --

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Suppose an important 

22 witness is reluctant to testify but is issued a subpoena 

23 by the United States attorney to appear before the grand 

24 jury, and then with reluctance he comes forward but, 

under oath, provides all of the key testimony necessary

1 to indict? Is he a complaining witness? 

2  MR. PINCUS: I think some lower courts have 

3 said no, Your Honor. Some lower courts have said all 

4 that --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, what's the test 

6 we're supposed to use to decide? 

7  MR. PINCUS: Well, the -- the test that this 

8 Court has set forth is whether the complaining witness 

9 is someone who sets the prosecution in motion. That's 

-- that's the phrase that this Court has used, and 

11 that's a phrase that's -- that is reflected in the 

12 common law, based on the common law. And the lower 

13 courts have not had a problem applying that case. There 

14 are seven circuits that now have adopted the rule 

that --

16  JUSTICE KENNEDY: In the hypothetical I 

17 gave, what's the answer? 

18  MR. PINCUS: I would say in the hypothetical 

19 you gave, Your Honor, that that person is not a 

complaining witness, because he did nothing other than 

21 come forward when he was subpoenaed. If someone comes 

22 forward to the prosecutor, urges an indictment, urges a 

23 prosecution, and then subsequently is subpoenaed, that 

24 might be a different case because you have --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Urges -- urges a 

8

1 prosecution. One area that causes me concern here are 

2 the domestic violence cases, where someone may well 

3 report an episode but, by the time it gets to whatever 

4 the indictment procedure is, a grand jury or otherwise, 

is unwilling to -- to testify and pursue it. And yet, 

6 that person may be the one who started the prosecution 

7 in motion. Is that individual a complaining witness? 

8  MR. PINCUS: That -- that person may be a 

9 complaining witness. You know, at common law, the 

complaining witness also has to be --

11  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, he says -- he or 

12 she says at the time, I -- I don't want prosecution to 

13 go forward. I -- you know, I would prefer that it not 

14 go forward.

 MR. PINCUS: Then that fact would obviously 

16 mitigate against her being a complaining witness. But 

17 -- but these --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: Mitigating? Come on. 

19  MR. PINCUS: Yes. She would not be --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Does it make her not a 

21 complaining witness? 

22  MR. PINCUS: Yes, she would not be a 

23 complaining witness, Your Honor. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. PINCUS: But I -- just to step back --

25

Official 

1  JUSTICE ALITO: The holding that you're 

2 asking for isn't going to do very much good if the -- if 

3 the mere issuance of the grand jury subpoena renders the 

4 person not a complaining witness.

 MR. PINCUS: I don't think --

6  JUSTICE ALITO: In that situation, then why 

7 not subpoena everybody? 

8  MR. PINCUS: I don't think the mere issuance 

9 of the subpoena does negate things that might -- take 

the hypothetical where there is someone who goes to the 

11 prosecutor, says there should be a prosecution here, 

12 maybe does the things that the hospital is alleged to 

13 have done in this case, and then subsequently is 

14 subpoenaed. I don't think the subpoena negates that 

prior activity. I don't think you can say, oh, now that 

16 you're subpoenaed, we wipe away everything that you have 

17 done to set the prosecution in motion. 

18  But I think in the hypothetical that you 

19 propounded, where there's -- the sole fact is someone 

doesn't do anything, they're subpoenaed to come before 

21 the grand jury and they give their evidence, that 

22 wouldn't meet the test. But --

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: In a case where the 

24 prosecutor is the prime mover, can there ever be a 

complaining witness? Where the prosecutor is making the 

10

25

Official 

1 decisions, can there ever be a complaining witness? 

2  MR. PINCUS: I think there can be, Your 

3 Honor. And, in fact, what this Court has indicated in 

4 other cases is that the fact that the prosecutor 

ultimately decides to seek the charge does not negate
 

6 what's happened before.
 

7  In the Hartman case, which dealt with a
 

8 retaliatory prosecution under -- a First Amendment
 

9 retaliation prosecution, the Court said the postal
 

inspectors, who in that case were alleged to have been 

11 the motivating force behind the retaliatory prosecution, 

12 could be held liable if there also was no probable 

13 cause. 

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Is the prosecutor a 

complaining witness? 

16  MR. PINCUS: The prosecutor can't be a 

17 complaining witness because the complaining witness is 

18 the person who provides the impetus to go forward. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Who instigates the 

prosecutor. 

21  MR. PINCUS: Yes. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. What about the 

23 person who instigates the instigator? 

24  MR. PINCUS: I'm not -- I'm not sure of 

the --

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, somebody who comes up 

2 to somebody and says: You know, you ought to -- you 

3 ought to --

4  MR. PINCUS: At common law --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- try to start a 

6 prosecution against this person. They say: Yeah, 

7 that's a good idea. So, that person goes and -- and 

8 gets a prosecution started. 

9  MR. PINCUS: And at common law that person 

could be -- could be liable for malicious prosecution 

11 because --

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: The person who 

13 instigates the instigator? 

14  MR. PINCUS: The person who in testimony --

a complaining witness, as Your Honor pointed out in --

16 in your opinion in Kalina, a complaining witness does 

17 not have to actually participate in the judicial 

18 proceedings. To be a complaining witness at common law, 

19 you could be a person who outside the judicial process 

pushed forward and was the mover behind the --

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, the instigator of the 

22 instigator is -- is a complaining witness or can be? 

23  MR. PINCUS: Can be. 

24  JUSTICE SCALIA: And you know what the next 

question's going to be, right?

1  MR. PINCUS: But tort law -- I mean --

2  JUSTICE SCALIA: The instigator of the 

3 instigator of the instigator. I mean, does this go back 

4 forever?

 MR. PINCUS: I think that's right, Your 

6 Honor. But I don't think the Court is writing on a 

7 blank slate here. Tort law has addressed these issues. 

8 There has been a malicious prosecution tort for hundreds 

9 of years. There certainly was in 1871, and tort law has 

dealt and continues to deal with the questions of 

11 causation and proximate cause and all of the questions 

12 that arise in these kinds of cases. So, it's not as if 

13 the Court here would be writing on a blank slate. 

14  And I think the critical thing is -- the 

question here is whether or not there was an absolute 

16 immunity rule in 1871 for persons in the situation of 

17 the Respondent. That is the critical question that the 

18 Court has framed. 

19  JUSTICE GINSBURG: He -- the instigator, 

what you call the complaining witness, would have 

21 been immune if he gave the identical testimony at the 

22 trial itself, right? 

23  MR. PINCUS: Yes, trial -- because --

24 because -- well, the trial testimony could not be the 

basis for finding the person a complaining witness 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company

Official 

1 because by that point, the prosecution has gotten 

2 rolling. The question is, what conduct can be used to 

3 prove that this is the person who was the instigator, 

4 the prime mover behind the prosecution?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: It's only -- it's only 

6 what you call the complaining witness that gets this 

7 special treatment? All the other witnesses before the 

8 grand jury would be absolutely immune? 

9  MR. PINCUS: Yes, Your Honor. That's what 

the common law rule was, and that's what Congress 

11 confronted when it enacted section 1983 in 1871. 

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: Could I make sure I 

13 understand what you just said, Mr. Pincus? When you 

14 said it can't be the testimony alone, is that right, 

that there have to be other acts exclusive of the 

16 testimony that make somebody a complaining witness? 

17  MR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor, it could be the 

18 testimony alone. I didn't mean to say that. I think 

19 what I meant to say, maybe in response to 

Justice Alito's question, was the fact of testifying 

21 under subpoena doesn't negate other evidence that's 

22 there. But the testimony alone can be enough, and there 

23 certainly are cases, common law cases, from the 1800s in 

24 which courts rely on testimony.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Rely on testimony, but rely 

14

25

1 on testimony exclusively; do you have any cases that do 

2 that? 

3  MR. PINCUS: Well, the cases are -- the 

4 cases are a little bit obscure, Your Honor, about what 

the facts are that they are relying on. So, I don't 

6 want to say that absolutely positively there's one --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand. 

8  MR. PINCUS: But I think, as a matter of 

9 logic --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I really don't understand 

11 this. You have one witness in the grand jury 

12 proceedings. That's the only witness. Can that witness 

13 fall within your rule and be the complaining witness? 

14  MR. PINCUS: Absolutely, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Just on the basis of the 

16 testimony alone? 

17  MR. PINCUS: Yes. But there could be --

18 there could be other evidence as well. I think --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: So, it's pretty risky to 

testify in a grand jury proceeding, then, right? 

21  MR. PINCUS: Well, the same --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Because even though you 

23 haven't -- you don't care whether it comes out that way 

24 or not. You're subpoenaed, and even though you're 

subpoenaed, you're going to hold me as a complaining 

15

25

Official 

1 witness.
 

2  MR. PINCUS: It's the same risk that the
 

3 affiants bore in Kalina and Malley, and it's the same
 

4 risk that the common law imposes on complaining
 

witnesses. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, the affiants came 

7 forward. I mean, that -- that's a different situation, 

8 isn't it? They, indeed, were self-starting. But the 

9 person who is subpoenaed to testify at a grand jury is 

not self-starting. And you're saying that that person's 

11 mere presence and the mere fact of that person's 

12 testifying is enough to hold him to be the complaining 

13 witness. 

14  MR. PINCUS: Your Honor, maybe I've confused 

the hypotheticals. I think we have one situation where 

16 there's someone -- all they've done is they've been 

17 subpoenaed and they've come forward and they've given 

18 their evidence. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes.

 MR. PINCUS: I think it would be very hard 

21 for that person to be labeled a complaining witness. 

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: Hard or impossible? 

23  MR. PINCUS: Impossible. Then you have a 

24 person --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Hard or impossible?

1  MR. PINCUS: I think it would be impossible, 

2 because I don't think there's any evidence that that 

3 person is the motivating force. 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. That's a different 

word. Thank you. So, the testimony alone cannot be the 

6 basis? 

7  MR. PINCUS: Compelled testimony alone. A 

8 person who testifies --

9  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay.

 MR. PINCUS: -- voluntarily before the grand 

11 jury I think is a different situation. 

12  JUSTICE ALITO: But you said that the 

13 issuance of a subpoena in itself is not sufficient to 

14 make somebody not a complaining witness. So, if you are 

issued a subpoena, you still might be a complaining 

16 witness if you really didn't need to get a subpoena. If 

17 you could have been persuaded to go without a subpoena, 

18 then maybe you're -- you could be a complaining witness. 

19  MR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor. I think I was 

responding to a third -- a third situation. So, we have 

21 one situation where all someone does is testify under 

22 subpoena. We have another situation where someone 

23 testifies, that person not a complaining witness, 

24 someone who testifies voluntarily; that voluntary 

testimony certainly could be used as evidence that 

17

25

Official 

1 person --

2  JUSTICE ALITO: I mean, somebody gets 

3 mugged --

4  MR. PINCUS: And then the third situation --

excuse me, Your Honor. I was just -- the third 

6 situation is where there's pre-testimony evidence, and 

7 there's also the fact that that person testified under 

8 subpoena. I don't think the fact that that person 

9 testified under subpoena negates the fact that there is 

other evidence that that person may have been the person 

11 who pushed the prosecution forward. So, that's the 

12 distinction that I was trying to draw. 

13  JUSTICE BREYER: But what is the reason why, 

14 if we give absolute immunity to the witness at a trial, 

we give absolute immunity to the prosecutors and 

16 government officials at the trial, and a grand jury is 

17 sort of like a trial, at least it's testimony under 

18 oath. And in addition there's this special thing about 

19 grand juries being secret, which, if you allow people 

who are annoyed -- and they'd be quite rightly angry. 

21 They've been acquitted. They had to go through this 

22 process. They want to sue somebody. If we let them 

23 sue, you'll wreck the secrecy in a lot of cases. So, I 

24 see a reason for treating the grand jury even more 

strictly. What's the reason for treating it less 

18

5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 strictly? 

2  MR. PINCUS: Well, I think there are two 

3 reasons, Your Honor. The first reason is that what this 

4 Court has said is that immunity decisions are based on 

the common law as --

6  JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose I don't accept 

7 that. Suppose I say, yes, I accept that, there's a 

8 relationship, but exactly what happened in 1871 is not 

9 precisely always the convincing feature for me. So, I 

read what the situation is today, and it is, I think, as 

11 I described it. So, given the situation today, my 

12 question remains. 

13  MR. PINCUS: Well, one -- one brief 

14 disagreement with your question, Your Honor. I think 

the situation today at common law is what it was. 

16  JUSTICE BREYER: You can't disagree with my 

17 question. 

18  (Laughter.) 

19  MR. PINCUS: But --

JUSTICE BREYER: I would like an answer to 

21 my question. 

22  MR. PINCUS: The answer is several-fold. 

23 The Court has given absolute immunity to witnesses in 

24 Briscoe. The policy reason -- the principal reason was 

the common law rule. The policy reasons that the Court 

19
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

20

25

Official 

1 gave were (a) we don't want to deter people from coming 

2 forward; and (b) the testimony will be put through the 

3 adversary process and is public, and those are 

4 protections against false testimony.

 In the -- in the grand jury situation, those 

6 protections are not present, neither transparency nor an 

7 adversary process. And what the Court said in Malley 

8 about people coming forward I think applies in the grand 

9 jury context as well to complaining witnesses. The 

Court in Malley said we want people who are setting the 

11 prosecution in motion, the special category of 

12 complaining witnesses -- we want them to think twice. 

13 That's not a bad thing when they are the motivating 

14 force behind the prosecution.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I thought the 

16 whole point of the grand jury was to protect citizens 

17 from unwarranted prosecutions. The grand jury initiates 

18 the prosecution. So, why do we look back beyond that? 

19 That's where the prosecution is initiated. You're not 

subject to prosecution until the grand jury returns the 

21 indictment. So, why do we talk about complaining 

22 witnesses initiating the prosecution? 

23  MR. PINCUS: I think -- well, we talk about 

24 them, I think, because of the reality that there are 

cases, and the common law recognized that there were

1 cases where the reason the prosecution got rolling was 

2 because either a private person or a government person 

3 was the person who was pushing it along. 

4  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, somebody's is 

not --

6  MR. PINCUS: It's true that the grand jury 

7 -- I'm sorry. 

8  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: No, go ahead. 

9  MR. PINCUS: The grand jury's decision is a 

step in the chain, but the Court has not said that, for 

11 example, the judge's decision in Kalina and Malley to 

12 issue the warrant broke the causal link between the 

13 false testimony in the affidavits in those case. Even 

14 though the judge was making an independent decision, the 

Court recognized, as the common law recognized, that 

16 there could be a causal chain back to the false 

17 testimony which essentially tainted the decisionmaker, 

18 the judge's decision, just as it taints the grand jury's 

19 decision.

 And, in fact, what lower courts have said is 

21 that it is only when there is an allegation of false 

22 testimony or other impropriety in the grand jury that 

23 looking back is possible. But, of course, that's the 

24 very situation in this case.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: The question is, where do

1 you locate the grand jury? We have on the one side, you 

2 recited Malley. That was an arrest warrant, testimony 

3 in support of an arrest warrant. Then we have the 

4 trial, where everybody gets absolute immunity. And 

grand jury is in between those two. So, why should we 

6 bracket it with the arrest warrant rather than with the 

7 trial? The -- the arrest warrant is certainly 

8 pre-prosecution. 

9  MR. PINCUS: Well, the first reason, Your 

Honor, is because that's what the common law did. And 

11 what the Court's -- the Court's inquiry here is to look 

12 at the common law and decide what Congress, when it 

13 enacted the statute in 1871, confronted. And when 

14 Congress enacted the statute in 1871, there were -- the 

rule was that complaining witnesses who testified before 

16 grand -- that grand jury testimony of people who were 

17 complaining witnesses was not immunized as a basis for 

18 malicious prosecution liability. 

19  What the Respondent is seeking here is to 

say my grand jury testimony is immunized as a basis of 

21 section 1983 liability. But at common law, that simply 

22 wasn't the rule. So, the first --

23  JUSTICE ALITO: And at common law, did any 

24 grand jury witnesses have absolute immunity from a claim 

for malicious prosecution?

Official 

1  MR. PINCUS: Well, the common law -- at
 

2 common law -- at common law, it wasn't a question of
 

3 immunity. There was no defamation liability for any
 

4 witness.


 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, could there be --

6  MR. PINCUS: The only liability was for 

7 malicious prosecution. 

8  JUSTICE ALITO: And could there be malicious 

9 prosecution liability for a witness before a grand jury 

who was not a, quote/unquote, "complaining witness"? 

11  MR. PINCUS: No, and that's the source of 

12 the distinction that the Court drew in Malley and 

13 Kalina. 

14  JUSTICE ALITO: So, you're not really asking 

us to adopt the common law rule, are you? You're asking 

16 for a variation of the common law rule that's limited to 

17 complaining witnesses. Or are you going further? Are 

18 you saying that no witness before a grand jury should 

19 have absolute immunity from a so-called 1983 malicious 

prosecution claim? 

21  MR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor, we're not. 

22 We're asking for exactly the rule that was at common 

23 law. What the Court has said in Kalina and Malley is --

24 the rule that the Court adopted there was based on 

precisely the same distinction that we rely on here.

1  JUSTICE ALITO: So, if I understand your 

2 answer, that you're not -- it's -- this whole business 

3 about complaining witness is irrelevant. It's any -- no 

4 witness before a grand jury has absolute immunity.

 MR. PINCUS: No, Your Honor, it's 

6 complaining witnesses. The distinction that the common 

7 law drew -- all witnesses were immune from defamation. 

8 Only -- the only people who could be subject to 

9 liability based on their testimony were people who 

qualified as complaining witnesses. That is why the 

11 court in Malley and Kalina drew the line it did. It 

12 said these people -- you were acting as a complaining 

13 witness. The function you're performing by submitting 

14 this affidavit is being a complaining witness. At 

common law, that function -- true, it wasn't technically 

16 immune, but it was subject to liability. Liability 

17 could be premised on those statements. 

18  JUSTICE ALITO: Any witness could -- who 

19 would satisfy the elements of the malicious prosecution 

tort could be liable? 

21  MR. PINCUS: Yes. 

22  JUSTICE ALITO: All right. That's a little

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you're saying that 

6 the only people who would be subject to suit for the 

7 malicious prosecution tort were complaining witnesses? 

8  MR. PINCUS: Yes. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Pincus, you -- in 

answer to one of Justice Kagan's questions, you noted 

11 that you really can't find a case where a court relied 

12 exclusively on the grand jury testimony. In most of the 

13 cases that I've reviewed, there's a discussion that both 

14 non-grand jury and grand jury testimony was being relied 

upon; is that accurate? 

16  MR. PINCUS: I think that's right, Your 

17 Honor. It's awfully hard to tell, but I wouldn't want 

18 to represent there's one. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could you tell me 

what -- the United States as amica is supporting vacatur 

21 and remand on the ground that there might be adequate 

22 independent evidence from the grand jury testimony in 

23 this case to sustain a cause of action. Do you agree 

24 with their recommendation? And if you don't agree, 

assume that we were to adopt the United States'

1 position. What would be the independent evidence that 

2 you have that would support a malicious prosecution 

3 claim? 

4  MR. PINCUS: Well, there -- there is 

independent evidence in this case, Your Honor, of --

6 before the Respondent testified before the grand jury 

7 there were -- there are allegations that he conspired 

8 with the district attorney and others to fabricate the 

9 evidence that he gave. And that obviously --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Now, the court below 

11 took that into account and said: You're only relying on 

12 the grand jury testimony to prove the conspiracy, and 

13 that's not enough. 

14  MR. PINCUS: Well, Your Honor, I think that 

what the Eleventh Circuit said was because this was all 

16 directed to the grand jury testimony, we're not going to 

17 separate -- uphold -- hold that there could be liability 

18 based on that alone. 

19  I think that's wrong for two reasons. First 

of all, our principal submission, of course, is there 

21 can be liability premised on the grand jury testimony 

22 and that there's no basis in the common law for a 

23 different rule. 

24  And our second position would be, even if 

you, the Court, thought that grand jury testimony for

1 some reason was off limits but became permissible as a 

2 basis for finding liability if there was other evidence, 

3 then that's true in this case as well. 

4  I want to return to Justice Breyer's 

question for 1 minute, because there was the third 

6 policy reason that I wanted to provide, which is, as we 

7 explain in our brief, in the States many prosecutors can 

8 proceed by information or indictment, and we think it 

9 would be a peculiar situation if liability could be 

premised when a proceeding is initiated by information, 

11 which Malley and Kalina make clear, but that if the 

12 proceeding is by grand jury, it would be wholly off 

13 limits. That doesn't make much sense, and it's totally 

14 inconsistent with the common law rule.

 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

 MR. JONES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

24 witnesses in the grand jury with no distinction with 

respect to whether they are the complaining witness or

1 otherwise. 

2  As this Court has said in Briscoe, that the 

3 -- you look at the purpose of protecting the witnesses, 

4 both at the grand jury proceeding and at trial, and you 

want to preserve every man's evidence and you want to 

6 keep the court from harassment --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: You would acknowledge that 

8 if someone instigates the grand jury proceeding but does 

9 not testify, that person could be sued if indeed the 

instigation was malicious? 

11  MR. JONES: If it's outside of the grand 

12 jury -- and I go for the but-for test, unlike the Van de 

13 Kamp --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, now, just answer my 

question. I've given you a hypothetical. He -- no 

16 doubt he instigated the grand jury proceeding. He got 

17 the -- the U.S. attorney to bring the proceeding, but he 

18 didn't testify. Could that person be sued? 

19  MR. JONES: Yes, that person could be sued 

under the but-for standard. 

21  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So, all he has to do 

22 to get himself off the hook is, after instigating it, he 

23 should testify, right? His testimony bathes him clean; 

24 is that it?

 MR. JONES: No, that isn't, because --

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: All right. So, then it --

2 so, all you're arguing, then, is that there has to be 

3 some evidence other than the mere testimony; is that 

4 your point?

 MR. JONES: That is my point. 

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

7  MR. JONES: That there has to be some 

8 evidence other than the mere testimony. And if there is 

9 evidence other than the mere testimony, indeed you can 

go forward with a 1983 claim. 

11  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then you agree with the 

12 -- with the position that the United States took, which 

13 is you can -- if there were -- there was evidence 

14 outside the grand jury proceeding that this person was 

the instigator, that that could be the basis for a 

16 malicious prosecution 1983 claim? I thought the United 

17 States' position was: We're not going to use the 

18 testimony before the grand jury, but if this person did 

19 things outside the grand jury to instigate the 

prosecution, that's -- that could --

21  MR. JONES: The way I understand the 

22 Solicitor General's position was that if the only way 

23 that you could prove the allegation was to use the grand 

24 jury testimony, then indeed you could not bring a suit 

under 1983. But I think as Justice Scalia's question

1 was proffered is that it was an independent act that in 

2 and of itself created a constitutional violation, 

3 independent, and actually caused the prosecution. Then 

4 indeed --

JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Jones, you --

6  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, do you agree that we 

7 should vacate and remand according to the suggestion of 

8 the Solicitor General? 

9  MR. JONES: No, Your Honor.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And why is that? 

11  MR. JONES: Well --

12  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is it just because of your 

13 view of the evidence, that there's no evidence to 

14 justify the remand?

 MR. JONES: Well, that's certainly one of 

16 the issues. But nothing like this was -- what the 

17 Solicitor General is recommending, none of those issues 

18 were raised below, none of those issues were raised in 

19 the court of appeals in the Eleventh Circuit, and in 

this --

21  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, you're saying that 

22 this was waived and was just not in the case? Because 

23 usually if the issue wasn't discussed, that's the reason 

24 we remand.

 MR. JONES: That's correct. It was waived,

2 not why cert was granted. 

3  JUSTICE SCALIA: I don't understand how it's 

4 waived. I don't understand that. How was it waived?

 MR. JONES: It was never presented by any 

6 side at any -- to any place in the court below. 

7  JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but if -- if there 

8 is -- if there is a theory of liability and we find that 

9 there is -- that that theory is baseless, we don't 

generally dismiss the complaint if there are other 

11 allegations in the complaint that could support 

12 liability on another theory. 

13  MR. JONES: Well, certainly, I mean, this 

14 case has to be -- it's going back to the district court 

anyway, as Your Honor is well aware. And perhaps it can 

16 be raised again at that time with an amendment. But at 

17 the present time, it's not in the case. 

18  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Mr. Jones, could I 

19 understand your responses to these questions? Because 

you said to Justice Scalia the fact that there's been 

21 testimony at the grand jury does not, if you will, 

22 immunize the person from suit based on other acts. Can 

23 you go further? In a suit based on other acts, could 

24 the grand jury testimony come in as evidence?

 MR. JONES: If you look at common law, 

31
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1 that's exactly what happened. At common law, and as 

2 Justice Scalia mentioned in -- in his concurrence in 

3 Kalina, what you had is two separate acts when you had a 

4 malicious prosecution at common law. The first act was 

actually complaining and making a complaint to -- to get 

6 a warrant; in other words, swearing at that point in 

7 time. But there, again, the person that complained 

8 actually didn't have to be a witness. 

9  But when he was a witness or when he or she 

became a witness at court, that testimony could then be 

11 used to show malice for the prosecution or for actually 

12 bringing the case. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: So, all you're saying is 

14 that there's absolute immunity for a suit based 

exclusively on grand jury testimony, and if the suit is 

16 based on something else, the grand jury testimony can 

17 come in. 

18  MR. JONES: That is correct, if indeed it's 

19 an independent cause of action outside of the court, 

yes. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know what an 

22 independent cause of action could be, because it is the 

23 grand jury proceeding that initiates the action. So, 

24 why would the common law permit it unless it recognized 

that a complaining witness has to do something to get

2  MR. JONES: Well --

3  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- and go in and testify 

4 to something false to be liable for malicious 

prosecution? But the point I'm making is I don't see 

6 how your position differs from the Government's at all, 

7 and I'm not sure what -- how you could have independent 

8 guilt proven that requires anything more than proof, 

9 than the proof they proffered below, which was that this 

police officer issued subpoenas and took other steps to 

11 start the grand jury's process. And then you use their 

12 testimony at the grand jury to figure out whether it was 

13 false or not. 

14  MR. JONES: First of all, to respond, one, 

our position with respect to the Solicitor General on 

16 that issue, I don't see it as any different. What I was 

17 suggesting, what I understood Justice Scalia to say, is 

18 when you have something independent that forms a cause 

19 of action, for example, if you take and plant evidence 

in of a crime, for example cocaine or something of that 

21 nature, that is a separate and distinct cause of action, 

22 and that would cause -- that action by an investigator 

23 might very well cause the -- the prosecution or the 

24 district attorney to act when indeed you would have --

they would find something --

1  JUSTICE BREYER: Is it different from -- I 

2 mean, I find the Solicitor General -- it's my fault, I'm 

3 sure -- I don't understand the position they're taking. 

4 I mean, I think in every case there's some evidence 

about what goes on outside the courtroom or the grand 

6 jury room, and then there is some evidence about what 

7 went on inside. And I don't know when you're supposed 

8 to introduce what. 

9  So, I'm guessing that -- that whatever the 

rule is about when you can use what parts of what, that 

11 if you win, the rule about when you should use or when 

12 you still can use the testimony that's given in the 

13 grand jury room is the same as the rule that says when 

14 you can use the testimony of a witness at trial.

 See, I would have thought that immunity 

16 means you can't use that testimony, but I'm told I'm 

17 wrong about that. You sometimes can use it. So, then I 

18 don't know when you can use it and when you can't. 

19 Maybe you know. You've studied this case. I admit I 

haven't studied it as thoroughly as I hope you have. 

21  (Laughter.) 

22  MR. JONES: I hope I have as well.

1 everything that's in Briscoe, as you know, is absolutely 

2 immune from civil damage litigation. 

3  JUSTICE BREYER: When you say absolutely 

4 immune, I'm thinking of a typical case as follows: 

Smith says to his friend: I hate that rat Jones. I am 

6 going to go and lie and say he stole my horse. 

7  Next step, he goes to the grand jury or 

8 someone and says: Jones stole my horse. 

9  Third step, he's in the grand jury room 

saying: Jones stole my horse. 

11  Fourth, he's at trial. Okay? 

12  So, what comes in and what doesn't? And can 

13 you bring a case in the first place? 

14  MR. JONES: Well, I --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm at sea. Whatever you 

16 can help me with, I'd be happy. 

17  MR. JONES: First of all -- and it might be 

18 a difficult time. But the -- when you have a grand 

19 jury, you have something different from just bringing a 

cause of action. What you have in a grand jury is you 

21 have evidence presented to the prosecutor, typically a 

22 district attorney, and then the district attorney makes 

23 an independent evaluation as to what to bring to the 

24 grand jury and who to indict or whether to indict 

anybody whatsoever.

1  That testimony in that grand jury -- if you 

2 bring a cause of action, for example if a cause of 

3 action is brought for malicious prosecution, which 

4 they're trying to do here, what this Court has said in 

the Van de Kamp case is that the only time that you can 

6 use that testimony is if there is something else outside 

7 of the grand jury --

8  JUSTICE BREYER: There's always something 

9 else. He didn't think of this thing for the first time 

in the grand jury room. The defendant thought of this 

11 thing outside the grand jury room before he even got to 

12 the grand jury, and he probably told somebody about it, 

13 or he could have, or at least there's the evidence he 

14 walked to the grand jury room. Okay? So, there's 

always something outside the grand jury. 

16  MR. JONES: Sure. Sure. But the case law 

17 says that if the prosecutor would not have taken the 

18 case or would not have done the case but for the conduct 

19 of that individual, then indeed you cannot bring the 

cause of action. 

21  JUSTICE ALITO: I have the same -- I have 

22 the same concern as Justice Breyer. And let me try to 

23 ask the question in a different way. 

24  Can you give me an example of a case in

3 sufficient to make out a claim of malicious prosecution? 

4 If that situation doesn't exist, then I don't see any 

difference between your position and Mr. Pincus's 

6 position. 

7  MR. JONES: It does exist, because typically 

8 when you have an investigation in any type of district 

9 attorney's office, what you have is investigators going 

out and investigating a case, bringing the material to 

11 the district attorney, then the district attorney looks 

12 at the material, and then the district attorney is the 

13 one that makes an independent decision. 

14  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, let's go back one 

stage. Let's go back to an arrest warrant. The 

16 witness -- and the concern that the affidavit in support 

17 of the warrant is filled with lies. The affidavit is 

18 presented to a judge. And I would think that's better 

19 than a prosecutor. And yet, there is no absolute 

immunity for someone who lies in order to get a warrant, 

21 even though the judge makes the judgment whether the 

22 warrant should issue. 

23  MR. JONES: The distinction in Malley is --

24 is this: First of all, the -- in Malley and when you go 

apply for a warrant, the -- the -- at that point in time

2 determining, the time, place, and manner in which to go 

3 to the judge, and also possibly he can, he or she can, 

4 select the judge that the person wants to go for. And 

then what has happened is that person who presents that 

6 evidence is presenting the evidence that he or she has 

7 gathered and is going to present it in a light most 

8 favorable to the investigation. That person won't 

9 necessarily present the bad part. They might present 

just only the -- exclusively the good part. And also 

11 that person isn't under the subpoena power. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Suppose -- suppose we 

13 had, instead of a grand jury proceeding and an 

14 indictment, an accusation to begin the prosecution and a 

supporting affidavit in connection with the accusation. 

16 Would there be -- would there be absolute immunity then 

17 for the affidavit that supports the accusation which 

18 will begin the prosecution? 

19  MR. JONES: If I understand your question, 

and I'm not sure I heard it exactly, are you saying if 

21 there's an affidavit that went before the grand jury? 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: No. We take the grand 

23 jury out of it. We're going to begin the case, the 

24 prosecution, by an information, or I think the Georgia 

law refers to something called an accusation. If -- if

6 essentially in Malley and Kalina, where you had those 

7 individuals coming before -- they were not subpoenaed. 

8 Those individuals -- whether it's affidavit or 

9 testimony, I think either one is testimony.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you -- you cited a 

11 provision of the Georgia Code that seems to equate 

12 what's called an accusation with an indictment. It's on 

13 the bottom of page 22: "All legal proceedings by which 

14 a person's liability for a crime is determined, 

commencing with the return of the indictment or the 

16 filing of the accusation." 

17  So, if the Georgia Code equates those two, 

18 the return of the indictment or the filing of the 

19 accusation, why shouldn't the immunity rule be the same 

for the two? And you told me that Malley would cover 

21 the filing of the accusation. So, why shouldn't it be 

22 the same for the return of the indictment? 

23  MR. JONES: And -- and I'm not positive I 

24 understand the question, but as I understand it, what 

you have in a Malley situation is, again, you have

1 somebody that is merely coming before the judge in the 

2 hope of getting a warrant to issue. That person 

3 doesn't -- isn't under the constraint of a prosecutor, 

4 an independent prosecutor, in the meantime. Actually, 

the person asking the questions, asking and actually 

6 subpoenaing a witness for like a grand jury, that person 

7 is actually -- and what the Court has said is 

8 potentially wasting judicial resources by bringing a 

9 not-so-good case, just like in Malley, to the court.

 And so, to protect the court and to protect 

11 the judicial process, the Court has said that person 

12 only has qualified immunity so as to make him think and 

13 make the process think before it happens, before they go 

14 to the judge.

 But in the grand jury scenario you have an 

16 independent individual, in this case the prosecutor, 

17 receiving the evidence and the prosecutor deciding what 

18 cases to bring. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So, explain to me 

again -- over here, Mr. Jones. 

21  Explain to me again why the act of sitting 

22 down with the prosecutor in his office and telling him a 

23 falsehood that leads the prosecutor to convene the grand 

24 jury and call you as a witness, why that act of meeting 

with the prosecutor and stating the false statement is

1 not actionable independently? 

2  Or is it your position that that would be? 

3  MR. JONES: It is the position that it can 

4 be, and -- and I hate to say -- equivocate there. But I 

will state this: If indeed that district attorney or
 

6 the prosecutor in a case would not have proceeded but
 

7 for that testimony or that statements before him, in
 

8 other words, he would not have done anything there,
 

9 like, as I stated earlier, like the planting of the
 

cocaine or the finding of the cocaine --

11  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: No, no, no, no. He sat 

12 down, told the prosecutor exactly what he was later 

13 going to say in the grand jury. I rarely called a 

14 witness to a grand jury when I was a prosecutor who I 

hadn't spoken to before. Occasionally, I had to because 

16 of circumstances, but the vast majority you sit down and 

17 talk to and find out what their story is. Identical 

18 story before and after during the grand jury. Is the 

19 story before an independent act sufficient to bring a 

malicious prosecution claim? 

21  MR. JONES: Under that scenario, no, because 

22 the only way that that act can be proven, the only way 

23 that the malicious prosecution claim can be proven, 

24 would be to get the grand jury testimony before -- to 

actually utilize that grand jury testimony, and that

4 that shows that the prosecutor met with --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

6  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the investigator? 

7  MR. JONES: I'm sorry. 

8  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You have a time sheet. 

9 You mean, you need a witness to say they met together? 

You need someone to say that they talked before the 

11 grand jury? Assuming you have that much evidence, you 

12 think that's enough? 

13  MR. JONES: I mean, do you need a witness to 

14 come and testify as to whether they had a communication?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Yes, exactly. Is that 

16 what you're requiring? 

17  MR. JONES: It -- it would appear that that 

18 would certainly be an element that you would have to 

19 establish. Now, whether you would need a witness or you 

can get one of those two to testify is another issue. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you regard the grand 

22 jury as a judicial proceeding? 

23  MR. JONES: Yes, I do. And this Court has 

24 so stated, not only in -- well, the Court has stated 

first of all in Burns v. Reed; it talks about how you

1 have prosecutorial immunity. And in Malley, it also 

2 states it's the first stage of the criminal proceeding. 

3  JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but there's no 

4 judge. And it seems to me odd to say -- there's no 

presiding judge, there's no cross-examination. And the 

6 indictment has the same function as an information. So, 

7 why should it rank as a judicial proceeding? 

8  MR. JONES: Well, it has many more of the 

9 trappings of a trial than, say, coming before a judge 

like in the Malley scenario. First of all, you're 

11 subject to compulsory process. The person is placed 

12 under oath. The person may indeed not even want to come 

13 and testify. I think that was earlier mentioned by 

14 Justice Scalia. The person might not even want to be 

there, and yet he's subpoenaed and he's forced to be 

16 there. 

17  The -- also in that situation, the district 

18 attorney, he or she, is the one that's controlling the 

19 evidence, one that's controlling what is before the 

court, and that person is also determining which person 

21 is going to be indicted and the evidence to be 

22 presented. 

23  So, the distinction between the two is, as I 

24 see it, significant. And one, the grand jury, is much 

more akin to a judicial proceeding and a trial than the

2  JUSTICE BREYER: Is the prosecutor immune? 

3 I know the prosecutor is not immune or the complaining 

4 witness is not when they get an arrest warrant. Is the 

prosecutor immune when he is taking the step of getting 

6 an information or indictment? 

7  MR. JONES: Yes. 

8  JUSTICE BREYER: He is immune? 

9  MR. JONES: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. So, this is 

11 equivalent to doing that. That's a prosecutorial 

12 function. The prosecution would be immune. 

13  MR. JONES: That is correct. 

14  JUSTICE BREYER: Of course, this isn't a 

prosecutor; this is a subordinate. The person here is 

16 the defendant who is not the prosecutor --

17  MR. JONES: No, the person here is the 

18 investigator who's employed by the prosecutor. And I 

19 think, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the prosecutor 

himself in this situation directed the investigator to 

21 appear before the grand jury, and directed him as to 

22 what to testify to at the grand jury. So -- and as Your 

23 Honor pointed out, the -- who is absolutely immune, in 

24 the grand jury setting the prosecutor is immune, the 

grand jurors are immune. In trial, the prosecutor is

4  JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any subordinate 

government official involved when a prosecutor gets an 

6 information, files an information or -- the way you get 

7 somebody indicted is you have an indictment, which is a 

8 grand jury, I guess. 

9  MR. JONES: Right.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Or an information. 

11  MR. JONES: Right. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: All right. When you get 

13 the information, is it just somebody from the district 

14 attorney's office or the prosecutor's office, or is 

there somebody else there? Is there a policeman there 

16 that gives any --

17  MR. JONES: There can be. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Can be, okay. If there is, 

19 has he ever been held immune or not? The prosecutor is 

immune. Now he's there with an assistant, the policeman 

21 to back him up. Is there any law on that, whether the 

22 policeman is immune? 

23  MR. JONES: Just if he's asking for an 

24 arrest warrant; is that --

 JUSTICE BREYER: No. 

6  MR. JONES: Then indeed, I would suggest 

7 it's very similar to the Malley scenario, where he would 

8 have a qualified immunity. 

9  JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that would go for the 

prosecutor, too, right? 

11  JUSTICE BREYER: No. 

12  JUSTICE GINSBURG: For the information? If 

13 you -- if you bracket it with Malley, the -- the 

14 prosecutor who lies to the magistrate is not going to 

have absolute immunity at the arrest warrant stage. Is 

16 the prosecutor absolutely immune for making out an 

17 information that's packed with lies? 

18  MR. JONES: Yes. Because that is -- that is 

19 what this Court has decided is intimately associated 

with the judicial phase of the criminal process. And 

21 any of the conduct that is intimately associated under 

22 Imbler, under Kalina, under various things, 

23 Burns v. Reed are intimately -- anything that's 

24 intimately associated is absolutely immune.

1 arrest warrant intimately associated? 

2  MR. JONES: Well, an arrest warrant in the 

3 -- like in a Kalina and a Malley situation, you didn't 

4 have a prosecutor going before them. That was an 

independent action by an investigator who went before a 

6 judge to seek a warrant and present any evidence that 

7 that person had. 

8  JUSTICE ALITO: Paragraph 29 of the 

9 complaint alleges Mr. Paulk and Mr. Hodges, acting under 

color of law, in retaliation and wrongfully influenced 

11 and instigated the prosecutorial decision to bring 

12 charges against Mr. Rehberg. 

13  Why isn't that sufficient to support a claim 

14 of so-called malicious prosecution without regard to the 

evidentiary -- without regard to the grand jury 

16 testimony? 

17  MR. JONES: Because -- just because they 

18 allegedly conspired together to do this doesn't mean the 

19 act was completed until after, in this case, Mr. Hodges 

-- and it was actually Kelly Burke -- actually performed 

21 what they did. Now -- and -- and if the prosecutor 

22 knows about it at that point and they allegedly 

23 conspire, now who is taking the act? It really is not 

24 anymore Mr. Paulk; it is the district attorney who is 

acting at that point, and it is the district attorney

1 that is now proceeding in the grand jury. And as -- as

3 associated with the judicial phase, and he's absolutely 

4 immune for his conduct. But even -- just because the 

district attorney knows about it and so does the 

6 investigator know about it, it is the conduct and the 

7 independent act now of the prosecutor to get the 

8 indictment. 

9  JUSTICE KAGAN: But, Mr. Jones, I feel as 

though now we're just arguing about facts. It seems to 

11 me that you have accepted a good deal of Mr. Pincus's 

12 case. You've said that you can bring an action against 

13 somebody based on acts outside of court, that the grand 

14 jury testimony can come in as evidence in that action, 

and all you're saying is that there's -- there's no way 

16 to bring this action in this case because your client 

17 didn't in fact do anything. 

18  MR. JONES: No. And perhaps that's not my 

19 position. First of all, I'm not saying that they're --

what I'm saying with respect to bringing a malicious 

21 prosecution claim is that -- I think Justice Scalia 

22 asked me if there is a completely independent act, but 

23 if -- in the scenario that you paint, just the fact that 

24 they've talked outside the grand jury, that does not 

authorize an independent cause of action for a malicious 

48

1 prosecution claim. 

2  What you have to have is an independent act, 

3 just like what you had at common law where you had two 

4 distinct acts: one, where you actually filed a 

complaint; now you become the complainant or, as the 

6 common law said, you became the complaining witness even 

7 though you didn't have to be a witness. But then if you 

8 were a witness, indeed, that testimony that you gave in 

9 the -- in the grand jury or in the trial could be used 

as to -- to prove your malicious intent in bringing the 

11 charge initially. 

12  And that -- that doesn't equate to what we 

13 have here in this -- in this scenario. What we have 

14 here is there may have been a discussion outside of the 

court or outside of the grand jury, but that discussion 

16 now ended, and now you have an independent act by the 

17 prosecutor to bring the cause of action. So, completely 

18 distinct, as I see it, completely distinct scenarios. 

19  If there are no further questions, thank you 

very much.

Official 

1  A couple of points. First of all, the --

2 the question about whether there -- it's an appropriate 

3 rule that a finding of complaining witness can be based 

4 on evidence outside of the grand jury, but it can't be 

based on grand jury testimony, that certainly wasn't the 

6 common law rule. And I note Justice Sotomayor asked 

7 whether there were any common law cases that relied 

8 solely on grand jury testimony. And although the cases 

9 are hard to parse, I would point the Court to the 

Anderson and the Moulton cases that we cite on page 3 of 

11 our reply brief. In those cases, in the Anderson case, 

12 the Court is talking about the charge to the jury, and 

13 what it says the evidence was is the fact that the 

14 defendant was listed as the complainant on the 

indictment and that he testified before the grand jury. 

16 And then in the Moulton case, the allegations of the 

17 complaint are set forth in the reporting of the case, 

18 and the only allegations are -- relate to the testimony 

19 before the grand jury.

 So, I think it's very hard to find any basis 

21 in the common law, which as the Court said -- has said 

22 is the controlling principle here, for ruling the grand 

23 jury testimony either entirely out of bounds as a basis 

24 for liability or for saying it's only in bounds if there 

is some other extrinsic evidence. There's just no

1 support for that in the common law, and I think it 

2 doesn't really make sense -- if this case had proceeded 

3 by information and Mr. Paulk's grand jury testimony had 

4 simply been placed in an affidavit and submitted in 

order to obtain the arrest warrant, Malley and Kalina 

6 would control, and it would be clear that there would be 

7 liability --

8  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, suppose this was a 

9 jurisdiction that didn't have grand juries but returned 

felony indictments by means of a preliminary hearing. 

11 Would a witness at a preliminary hearing have absolute 

12 immunity? There's a judge presiding there. 

13  MR. PINCUS: A -- a complaining witness, I 

14 don't think -- if that is the proceeding that sets 

the -- that determines whether or not there's going to 

16 be a prosecution, I think an ordinary witness would be 

17 absolutely immune, but a complaining witness would not 

18 be. 

19  JUSTICE BREYER: Are there States that have 

-- or are there any jurisdictions where they don't give 

21 immunity to grand jury testimony for complaining 

22 witnesses or others? 

23  MR. PINCUS: Yes, there are. There are. 

24 There are both at the common law and today, Your Honor;

1 Courts have -- have looked into whether or not there's a 

2 complaining witness. Some courts say, in order to get 

3 grand jury testimony, you have to -- you have to meet 

4 some kind of a threshold. Often, these cases are proven 

up by deposing the defendant and asking him what he 

6 testified about before the grand jury without intruding 

7 on the grand jury at all. But I think those seven 

8 circuits, there has been no indication of some kind of 

9 disruption of the process.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Are those -- are those cases 

11 involving grand jury proceedings like the one here, 

12 which does look somewhat like the complaint situation? 

13 Or are they more traditional grand jury settings? 

14  MR. PINCUS: I don't -- I don't want to -- I 

don't know, Your Honor. We'd be happy to file something 

16 further, if the Court would like. 

17  JUSTICE KAGAN: To me, Mr. Pincus, the 

18 oddest thing about your case is the notion of being able 

19 to sue the investigator when you can't sue the 

prosecutor for whom he works. So that even if there 

21 is -- are some set of people that you -- that you could 

22 sue for actions in the grand jury context, the notion 

23 that you can sue an employee of a prosecutor when you 

24 can't sue the prosecutor seems an odd rule.
