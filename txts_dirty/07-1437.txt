 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Case 07-1437, Carlsbad Technology v. HIF Bio, 

Inc.

 Mr. Rhodes.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN W. RHODES

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. RHODES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 The single issue presented in this case is 

whether the bar to review under 1447(d) is applicable to 

a district court's discretionary decision to decline the 

exercise of supplemental jurisdiction. In this case, 

after the district court dismissed Respondent's federal 

RICO claim, the district court remanded the remaining 

state law claims under 1367(c). That was not a remand 

based upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because 

jurisdiction was specifically conferred upon the court 

by 1367(a).

 It's been the rule for some 30 years that 

the bar of 1447(d) is limited to the specific grounds 

set forth in 1447(c). And for reference the statutes 

are on page 2 and 3 of Petitioner's blue brief.

 Those two grounds are a remand that's based

upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction and a remand 

that is based upon any defect other than a lack of 

subject matter jurisdiction if it's raised by a timely 

motion for remand filed within 30 days of the notice of 

removal. The only prong of 1447(c) that's applicable in 

this case is whether this remand is one that's based 

upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

 Now, Congress clearly conferred jurisdiction 

on the district courts in 1367(a), where the case 

contains a Federal claim and related State law claims, 

and a remand based upon a court's discretion to decline 

to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is not a remand 

that's based upon the court's lack of subject matter 

jurisdiction.

 Jurisdiction either exists or it does not. 

A district court's power to hear a case and its power to 

decline to exercise jurisdiction are part and parcel of 

the same thing. Absent the power to hear a case, a 

district court cannot decline to exercise that -- or 

cannot exercise discretion to decline to exercise that 

jurisdiction.

 Now, in this Court's Osborn v. Haley case, 

it made reference back to Carnegie-Mellon and also 

United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, that even if only State 

law claims are remaining in the case after the Federal

claim has been resolved, the district court has 

discretion consistent with Article III to retain 

jurisdiction over that cause of action.

 Now, this is inconsistent with the Federal 

Circuit's analysis in this case that a remand based upon 

1367(c) is a remand based upon a lack of subject matter 

jurisdiction because in its view an independent basis 

for that jurisdiction is lacking.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Isn't there something odd 

about saying if it's really fundamental like the 

presence or absence of subject matter jurisdiction, that 

is not reviewable? It's not disputed, right? That if 

the district court says, I lack subject matter 

jurisdiction over, let's say, the RICO claim, as wrong 

as that might be, that would not be reviewable, right?

 MR. RHODES: Justice Ginsburg, I agree with 

that, because if the court does say that I am remanding 

this because, either rightly or wrongly, I lack subject 

matter jurisdiction, then that would fall squarely 

within 1447(c) and (d).

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Though that could be a 

very grave error and yet, on a matter of discretion, 

that that would be reviewable. And I appreciate your 

statutory argument, but it just seems odd to think that 

Congress would want to be firm that if the remand is for

lack of subject matter jurisdiction, wrong or right, no 

review, but it was a discretionary exercise, I could 

keep this, but I choose not to, that that is reviewable.

 That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to 

say the judge could keep it or remand it, that that 

action is reviewable, but the action of saying I don't 

have jurisdiction, when indeed the court did have 

jurisdiction, is just totally immune from review.

 MR. RHODES: I agree with you, Justice 

Ginsburg, that that seems rather confusing. I would 

address my answer in this way: The review ban of 

1447(d) arose in the situations where apparently 

Congress wanted to -- to inhibit the abuse by those 

seeking only to delay the case by filing a motion for 

remand.

 For example, a case that is filed in State 

court that clearly expresses no Federal question or 

diversity issue, yet the defendant, in order to delay 

the case, will then remove it to Federal court. In 

those situations Congress wants to prevent those kinds 

of frivolous removals to Federal court.

 But here in, our particular case -- and 

maybe -- let me back up a minute. Maybe we should look 

at that in a different way, because even though you may 

have a legitimate basis for removing the case to Federal

court and the district court disagrees with you, perhaps 

the better policy is that those types of remands should 

not be reviewable, even though sometimes a district 

court is going to get them wrong.

 But in this particular case, there was a 

Federal RICO claim asserted against us in state court, 

and as a defendant we were not removing that case on 

some frivolous basis. We were removing it because we 

were entitled to be in Federal court.

 It was only after the district judge 

dismissed the Federal RICO count -- and there was no 

motion for remand on this case filed by Respondents --

the district court sua sponte decided that he was not 

going to exercise his power to hear this case because he 

thought there were legitimate State law claims and he 

remanded on that basis. Now, that's a discretionary 

remand and normally we would be arguing that where 

discretion is exercised by a district court it should be 

reviewable for an abuse of discretion.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't it be --

here the district judge said: I got rid of the RICO 

claim; all that's left are State law claims, and there's 

no Federal interest in this case any more. They're all 

State law claims, they belong to State court, good-bye. 

I could keep it, I choose not to, because it isn't a

sound use of the resources of the Federal court.

 Now, even if you're right that this is a 

discretionary decision, so you can't say no jurisdiction 

because the discretion implies that there is power, 

isn't it 99 cases out of 100 that the court of appeals, 

assuming reviewability, will say, we should defer to the 

district judge about questions of this nature, the 

district judge's decision that this isn't worth the time 

of the Federal court?

 MR. RHODES: I'm not sure about the number 

of percentage of cases that -- that there is going to be 

a decision by the appellate court to say we shouldn't 

interfere in that, Justice Ginsburg.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But wouldn't you -- as a 

practical judgment, the Federal claim is gone, there is 

pending jurisdiction or now supplemental jurisdiction 

over the State claim, but the district court is told by 

Congress: It's your call; it's a matter of discretion. 

And the judge gives one of the reasons that's 

enumerated, that reason being that the State claims are 

overwhelming in this case, the RICO claim is dismissed, 

thinking it was worthless, so it's a State case.

 Why would a court of appeals overturn such a 

judgment?

 MR. RHODES: I think, Justice Ginsburg, I

can give you an answer to that because there is a recent 

case that's in our brief, the Brookshire case from the 

Fifth Circuit, where the district court exercised 

jurisdiction over Federal and supplemental claims, and 

did that for quite a while and ruled on a number of 

dispositive motions; and then basically on the eve of 

trial, after resolving the Federal claim, remanded it 

back to the State court.

 The Fifth Circuit, because it had the 

ability to review that, under the statutory 

construction, was able to review that on the basis of an 

abuse of discretion and said that the district court had 

definitely abused its discretion. After retaining 

jurisdiction for that length of time and then returning 

it to State court, that was a waste of judicial 

resources.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was because we 

would have to retread the same ground in the State court 

that had already been covered in the Federal court, but 

that's not the kind of case that was presented here. I 

know the case has lingered for a long time, but there 

was no processing of those State law claims. The judge 

concentrated on RICO, threw it out, and said "the rest 

of the claims I'm not interested in."

 So it's not a case like the Fifth Circuit

where there was a large investment of Federal court 

energy and time and sending it back would mean going 

over once again what had already transpired in the 

Federal court.

 MR. RHODES: That is true. This case is 

different because what the -- what the district court 

had labeled as legitimate State law claims as to, for 

example, inventorship, we argued are within the 

exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal court, and that is 

why we appealed to the Federal Circuit in order to have 

that issue resolved.

 Here, if we went back to State court we 

would be in the position of having to argue that the 

State court -- that the State court lacked jurisdiction 

to hear that claim because it was something that was 

within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal court. 

It seems that in this particular situation it would be 

better to have the Federal Circuit to pass upon the 

exclusivity of the inventorship issue under the patent 

laws rather than to have to go back to State court and 

work back up through the State court system to have that 

resolved.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Could you explain why 

that is a Federal question? It's a dispute over the 

ownership of this invention, right? So it's not a

question of the validity of a patent or infringement of 

a patent?  It's just the invention is like any res, and 

two parties are disputing about ownership. Why is --

why does that become a Federal case?

 MR. RHODES: It became a Federal question 

because in our view it arose under the patent laws 

because when they filed their complaint, even though 

they couched it in terms of purely State law claims, 

they did allege that we had falsely claimed to be the 

inventors; and the basis for that claim that we falsely 

claimed to be the inventors was the oath and declaration 

that was filed in connection with our patent 

applications at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

 So what they were raising was an issue with 

respect to our ability to claim to be the inventors of 

what we claimed in our U.S. patent application. 

Therefore, since that falls squarely under our 

entitlement to -- to inventorship, of what we claim to 

be the inventors, under Article I, section 8, it seemed 

to us that that clearly fell within the exclusive 

jurisdiction of the Federal court.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I just ask one sort of 

a preliminary question? If we just applied the plain 

language of 1447(d), then this case was properly 

remanded; the remand order is not subject to review. Is

that correct?

 MR. RHODES: Yes. If we just read 1447(d) 

on its face, that's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What really prevents us 

from reaching that decision in this case? Because 

actually it's an open question because you were both 

arguing about it here and you certainly disagree. Why 

couldn't we just simply say for this particular category 

of remand orders, we'll just apply the plain language of 

1447(d)?

 MR. RHODES: That would be going against the 

rule that was set out in Thermtron that 1447(d) was 

limited to only the specified grounds of 1447(c), which 

are lack of --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I understand it would be a 

modification of the dicta in Thermtron, but why wouldn't 

that be a simple solution to this case?

 MR. RHODES: I'm not sure that would be a 

simple solution to this case, Justice Stevens, and the 

reason for that is that if we -- if the Court decides to 

do that, then we return to those areas where total chaos 

could really break out, and the reason for that is that 

we would be in a situation where district courts can --

can dress up in language that is lack of subject matter 

jurisdiction and remand cases, knowing that there is not

going to be any review.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, no, that wouldn't 

avoid the plain language of the statute. Pretextual 

district court orders wouldn't avoid the plain language 

of the statute.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think there's no 

need to dress up anything. I mean, as Justice Stevens 

point, you wouldn't have to dress up anything; if you 

send it back, it's not reviewable.

 MR. RHODES: If we were to read 1447(d) just 

plainly on its face without --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How could we do that in 

light of Thermtron? Thermtron went against the clear 

text of the statute that says remands are not 

reviewable, period; and in Thermtron the Court said, yes 

they are sometimes, if we think it's so outrageous for a 

district judge to say: Yeah, I've got jurisdiction over 

this case, but my docket is so crowded, and this is a --

this is a small-change case; it belongs in State court. 

The court, I think, was outraged by a district court 

thinking that it could dump a case simply because it was 

too busy with more important things.

 That was the setting of Thermtron, and to 

reach the result that the court reached, the court had

to go against the language of the statute when read in 

absolute terms. But anyway, the court did that, and 

then they gave a rationale for what the new test was 

going to be. It was no longer going to be remands are 

no longer -- remands are not reviewable; it's going to 

be -- that applies only to the cases where -- what was 

it, subsections (c) and (d) of 1447? The -- it -- the 

court read the statute to say less than it in fact did. 

That's what Thermtron did.

 MR. RHODES: That is the exact holding of 

Thermtron, that they were not going to construe that so 

woodenly to allow a district court to abdicate its 

mandatory jurisdiction.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, "woodenly" is 

a bit much. I mean, they're going to read it not to say 

what it says. And Thermtron involved the court saying: 

I'm not going to take this because I'm too busy with 

other things. I mean, it could be limited to that 

unusual situation, couldn't it?

 MR. RHODES: Mr. Chief Justice, it could, 

but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And it would solve 

the problem Justice Ginsburg pointed out earlier, that 

this way you don't get to appeal big things like no 

subject matter jurisdiction, but you do get to appeal

picayune things.

 MR. RHODES: Again, I'm not sure how we 

would divide those up between big things and picayune 

things. But I think, to answer your question, we have 

30 years of this particular rule under Thermtron being 

uniformly applied by all the circuit courts of appeal, 

and they have found this to be a workable, statutory 

interpretation to give them a framework to handle these 

kinds of cases. And it's not a situation where the 

circuit courts of appeal have run away from situations 

like this, where remands have been based upon declining 

to exercise discretionary power to send it back to State 

court. They have seemed to want to work within the 

statutory framework to review those kinds of cases.

 And I think it would be a large departure to 

go back and try to modify what all the circuit courts of 

appeal, except for maybe the Federal Circuit, had 

adopted as a workable framework in order to solve these 

kinds of problems.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, one clear way to do 

it would be to overrule Thermtron, but neither party has 

asked for that. You haven't asked for it and the other 

side hasn't asked for it.

 MR. RHODES: That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg.

JUSTICE STEVENS: You just have to 

distinguish Thermtron. You don't have to overrule it. 

You'd still apply it on its facts.

 That's a very different problem. When the 

judge says, I'm too busy to hear this, I'm going to send 

it back to State court, that's what Thermtron resolved. 

Here --

MR. RHODES: And yet --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's not involved here.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your concern is what 

was the Court's reasoning, and you could apply the 

Court's reasoning, its interpretation of 1447.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: You have to get rid of 

Quackenbush, too, don't you?

 MR. RHODES: Yes, Quackenbush is a --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Throw that overboard, too?

 MR. RHODES: We would have to overthrow that 

as well, and the reason for that is because Quackenbush 

was a remand based upon -- an abstention-based remand 

under Burford, and in that case, this Court found that 

abstention-based remands did not fall within either 

prong of 1447(c). So -- in fact, this Court gave that 

very little attention in Quackenbush before it moved on 

to the 1291 issue.

Respondents asked us to overrule Thermtron. On page 22, 

you say, "Respondents' implicit request for this Court 

to overrule Thermtron should be rejected."

 MR. RHODES: Yes, we did say that, and I'm 

not sure that they -- they expressly said you should 

overrule Thermtron, but the strong suggestion in their 

brief was perhaps you should.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, isn't it -- isn't it 

also the case that Congress has amended the relevant 

provisions of 1447 since Thermtron and they have not 

seen fit to overrule or change those provisions?

 MR. RHODES: Given the fact that Congress 

has twice amended 1447(c) after Thermtron, it seems that 

they have actually ratified this Court's statutory 

construction under Thermtron, and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So this gets a lot 

of attention across the street? The reviewability of 

remand orders gets --

(Laughter.)

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I mean, in one of 

those provisions they said this was only technical 

amendments, and if they're just doing technical 

amendments that doesn't mean they have to look at it and 

approve the whole thing.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, that's right, but 

what if we want to get rid of it?

 (Laughter.)

 MR. RHODES: I can't suggest what the Court 

might finally decide other than to say that -- that, 

again, the circuit courts of appeal have uniformly 

applied this. They seem to be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they don't 

have a choice, right? They can't say, I don't like the 

Supreme Court rule so I'm not going to apply it, other 

than the Federal Circuit.

 MR. RHODES: Actually, Mr. Chief Justice, 

that was going to be my next point. Not the Federal 

Circuit -- but it does, again, provide a workable 

framework for dealing with these issues, and it seems to 

be a very large departure to go back and wipe out the 

last 30 years of case law that has been developed to 

handle these issues. It would be a large departure.

 If there's no other questions, I'll reserve 

the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just make one 

comment on the large departure: Would it be a large

departure if we just said, in the very narrow category 

of cases where there has been a remand on the basis of 

-- the district judge doesn't want to exercise 

supplementary jurisdiction over State law claims, that's 

not appealable, period? Just say that's a slight 

exception from Thermtron?

 MR. RHODES: Well, Mr. Chief Justice --

sorry -- Justice Stevens, that would be an exception 

under Thermtron that doesn't seem to be called for 

because the way it's been interpreted, it has to be --

and the way even the amendments in '88 and again in '96 

-- it's only barred if it's for a lack of subject matter 

jurisdiction, and plainly here a discretionary remand --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- not for that basis? 

They're not amendments of subsection (d), and subsection 

(d) is what has the language that really reads right on 

this case.

 MR. RHODES: Well, I think the other -- the 

other problem with that is the whole doctrine of -- of 

supplemental jurisdiction that was first laid out in 

Carnegie-Mellon and United Mine Workers, where the 

difference between remands under 1367(c) seem not to 

overlap with the remands under 1447(d) and 1441. So if 

we made that an exception and we pulled this into 

1447(d), it -- I'm not sure what the consequences would

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE S. ALLISON

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. ALLISON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Let me begin with Petitioner's counsel's 

last remark, and that is that we don't know what the 

consequences would be, except that we do know that by 

applying the review bar to supplemental jurisdiction 

remands, it would bring us closer to achieving the 

purpose that has been expressed in the statutes of 

Congress since 1887.

 I know that the Court is familiar with the 

late Chief Justice Rehnquist's dissenting opinion when 

he was an Associate Justice in the Thermtron case and 

Justice Rehnquist at that time wrote that there had been 

no cases since the review bar was put into place in 

1887, no cases where exceptions to review had been 

recognized. He believed that it was a plenary bar on 

review.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that was a dissenting 

opinion, and that was how many years ago? How many 

years?

MR. ALLISON: Justice Ginsburg, it -- it was 

a dissenting opinion, and it was in 1976, and we 

certainly would not cite it as authoritative except for 

our confidence in Justice Rehnquist's review of the law 

as it existed at that time.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But you have a majority 

rationale that says, although 1447(d) reads in absolute 

terms, in fact the only remands that it covers are those 

based on a defect in the removal or lack of subject 

matter jurisdiction. So you can't say, well, Thermtron 

had a result that we can limit to Thermtron's own 

unusual facts because the court gave a rationale. I 

mean, courts give reasons for what they do. And the 

court drastically limited 1447(d) when it said 1447(d) 

has to be read consonant with 1447(c), and 1447(c) deals 

with only two kinds of remands, one for defective 

removal and the other for lack of subject matter 

jurisdiction.

 MR. ALLISON: That is correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. And, in fact, to harken to your earlier 

question, to Your Honor's earlier question, we are not 

asking for Thermtron to be overruled, but I think, in 

effect, to be updated.

 The Court in Thermtron did give a rationale, 

and the rationale that it gave was that it viewed, the

opinion for the Court by Justice White viewed 1447(c) as 

being the sole source of Federal remand power. And as 

the Court noticed in the ensuing 30, 40 -- excuse me --

yes, 40-odd years, there have been a number of other 

sources of remand power recognized.

 And we see no reason why the holding in 

Thermtron should not be overruled but be updated to 

recognize that the spirit of what the Court held in that 

case would be served and would be harmonized with the 

review bar as it has existed lo these 120 odd-years, 

would be served by expanding the -- excuse me, 

contracting the reach of Thermtron so that it is not 

simply 1447(c) remands, but any remand authorized by 

statute.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. But no matter -- no 

matter what adjective or what verb you use, that's 

overruling a very clear rule of Thermtron. And we 

normally operate on a theory that when a conventional 

statute is construed by this Court, it stays construed 

until Congress changes it.

 And I don't -- I don't see how you can 

follow the line of reasoning that you're proposing, even 

though you talk about updating and harmonizing, without 

violating that basic stare decisis rule.

 MR. ALLISON: It's an essential question,

Justice Souter. And I think the way we harmonize it is 

to say that Thermtron has indeed been pared back by the 

Court's subsequent decisions. And, of course, it is our 

second argument that the Court do something with the 

rule in Thermtron.

 Our primary argument gets to the question of 

the statutory language and whether a Cohill remand falls 

within it. But our secondary argument is to say, 

certainly, it's well recognized that Cohill disapproved 

and pared down that portion of Thermtron that held that 

the only remand power is the remand power expressed in 

1447(c).

 And a later case, in Quackenbush, the 

question of whether mandamus or appeal was the 

appropriate vehicle for challenging remand orders. And 

in that case, again, the Court said that we are 

disavowing Thermtron's sweeping statement that mandamus 

is the only vehicle for challenging a remand order.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: We did -- we did not 

disavow the relationship between (c) and (d).

 MR. ALLISON: Indeed, the Court did not. 

And we suggest again only -- it is only a suggestion in 

our brief that the Court might wish to look at the 

ensuing history since Thermtron and make a similar 

limiting statement that recognizes that a lot of remand

authority has been established since Thermtron, and a 

number of statutes by the Court's -- by the Court's 

holding in Cohill.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What in addition to the 

civil rights provision?

 MR. ALLISON: Well, indeed in Things 

Remembered, the Court was considering whether a 1447's, 

comma -- whether 1447's review bar applied to a remand 

under 1452. 1452 is another statute that deals with 

remands in the context of cases associated with 

bankruptcy issues. And in that case, there was a remand 

for failing to follow a removal procedure, and the Court 

held, citing Rice, United States versus Rice, based on 

Congress's awareness of the universality of the review 

ban. That when another statute comes in place that 

provides for remand, for the review bar applies whether 

or not, of course --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then that's a specific 

statute that would prevail over the general provision.

 MR. ALLISON: It's a little bit -- Justice 

Ginsburg, it's a little bit different than the Court's 

decision in Osborn, in which the much more specific 

Westfall Act Provision was held to prevail over 1447.

 In Things Remembered, it was simply the fact 

that the review bar was held to apply to a remand, even

according -- under another statute, and, of course, 

recognizing that there are now other statutory bases for 

remand. The interesting thing about 1452 -- and Justice 

Ginsburg, I believe you wrote the concurrence on this --

is that 1452 provides for remand on any equitable 

ground, and that such remands are not subject to review 

by appeal or otherwise.

 So 1452, again, expresses, I think, a trend 

in the thinking of Congress, if there is such a thing as 

the thinking of Congress, that the review bar will be 

expanded and will even include such discretionary 

decisions by a district court as any equitable ground.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But Things Remembered, I 

think, was raised very carefully, such to say that the 

question that's before the Court now has not been 

decided before, the precise question here --

MR. ALLISON: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- discretionary remand?

 MR. ALLISON: That is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- and I think, I 

looked again at Things Remembered, and it turned out to 

be just as I remembered it --

(Laughter.)

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- that it was neutral, 

colorless. It just said we haven't been confronted with

this issue. And I think Powerex said the same thing, 

although it said it in more definite terms, it is far 

from clear.

 MR. ALLISON: That is true, and that is what 

the federal circuit said -- meant when it said that 

Powerex made the question precedential. Because, 

certainly, if Things Remembered had decided the issue 

that's before the Court today, I think the issue 

wouldn't be before the Court today. And that is, of 

course, why we're here.

 But the Thermtron -- the Thermtron issue 

really is our second argument, and the it is a very 

gentle argument that the Court -- and if the Court 

certainly wishes to continue discussing that, that is --

that is very profitable for what we're doing here today.

 But the first argument is that, harkening 

back to your original questions, Justice Ginsburg, why 

shouldn't a remand when only state law claims remain in 

a case, and -- Cohill 1367(c)3 why should that not come 

within the language of 1447(c), what I'll call the 

jurisdictional clause, because it clearly is a matter 

that is only of concern to state courts -- and I think 

that the Court in United Mine Workers v. Gibbs made 

clear that when all State -- all the federal claims have 

left the case and only State law claims remain, that

it's almost presumptive that those should be sent back.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but your opponent's 

argument is that the claims that remain do include a 

federal claim.

 MR. ALLISON: That is true, Justice Stevens. 

That is his argument. And I think what's important 

about that argument is the inconsistency it sets up. It 

essentially casts a net that draws in these supplemental 

jurisdiction cases. And what the net does is it allows 

the courts of appeals to review some artful pleading 

issues, which is essentially what we have here. We have 

state law claims, and our opponents are suggesting that 

these are, in fact, disguised federal claims that must 

be heard in federal --

JUSTICE STEVENS: What about the ruling on 

the RICO claim itself? That was clearly a federal 

issue.

 MR. ALLISON: Yes. The RICO claim was 

what -- was what gave the district court jurisdiction 

over the case in the first place. And it's interesting 

that in the district court's decision, it made me 

think -- it made me think a little bit of the Waco case, 

because in the district court's decision, the district 

court very clearly said, first, I have no jurisdiction 

over these State law claims, and I'm going to remand

them, and now I will turn to the RICO claim which 

creates a conundrum that I'm not sure --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Maybe the district judge 

didn't say that. Maybe you can point me to the place 

where it did. But if it did say it, it's flatly wrong, 

because there is -- that's what supplemental 

jurisdiction is. It's says you have jurisdiction, it's 

a huge difference between you have no jurisdiction, you 

are powerless, and you have power, but it's up to you to 

exercise it or not.

 MR. ALLISON: Justice Ginsburg, that's why 

we didn't -- we didn't press that point because I think 

-- I think that even we can see that the court exercised 

its jurisdiction to decide and dismiss the RICO claim, 

although it's reminiscent of -- of -- of the decision 

in Kircher --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: It wasn't a discretionary 

decision about RICO. RICO -- there was no Federal 

claims stated. That's out of it.

 MR. ALLISON: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: What the district court 

has jurisdiction over are the supplemental claims, which 

it can choose not to exercise, but it can say, "I don't 

have jurisdiction," because Congress has given 

supplemental jurisdiction, but then left it to the court

to remand on stated conditions.

 But you -- you seem to conflate the absence 

of subject matter jurisdiction with a discretionary 

decision not to exercise subject matter jurisdiction 

that the court undoubtedly has.

 MR. ALLISON: Well, Justice Ginsburg, I have 

made every effort not to conflate those two -- those two 

concepts, and in fact we did say that when -- when a 

court acquires supplemental jurisdiction in a case, that 

that is a species of subject matter jurisdiction at that 

point, as the Court held in City of Chicago v 

International College of Surgeons.

 At that point the court does have a 

mandatory discretion -- or mandatory jurisdiction to 

exercise power over the entire Article III case; but we 

then argue when the Federal claims leave the case that 

jurisdiction changes. That jurisdiction changes from a 

mandatory one that the court, as in Thermtron, would 

certainly be concerned if the district court had -- if 

jurisdiction that's mandatory. But it changes by 

operation of 1367 from mandatory to discretionary; and 

when Congress passed 1367 in 1990, Congress intended to 

codify the existing law right up through Cohill on the 

subject of supplemental jurisdiction, combining 

ancillary and intended in those --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So your idea is 

there is jurisdiction, but when the Federal claims fall 

out then there is no jurisdiction?

 MR. ALLISON: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Okay, but that seems 

to me to echo the fundamental misperception that if you 

have Federal jurisdiction based on a particular event --

let's say if you're dumping chemicals in the water; that 

gives you a Federal cause of action; you have Federal 

jurisdiction, there's a trial; it turns out you weren't 

dumping chemicals with it. You don't then say "there is 

no jurisdiction; there was jurisdiction before, but once 

the finding is made that the facts didn't support it, 

then there was no jurisdiction." You say, "there was 

jurisdiction all the time and you lose."

 MR. ALLISON: There was -- there was indeed 

jurisdiction. And what we argue is that the nature of 

the change, when it goes from mandatory, the concern of 

Thermtron, to discretionary, which gives -- virtually 

pushes out of the Federal Court to the State courts 

anytime up until trial -- the nature of that 

jurisdiction changes; and we believe that that is not 

what Congress intended by the words "subject matter 

jurisdiction" in 1447(c).

 So if we come back to the words of the

statute, the words of the statute should be construed 

broadly in order to serve the purposes of -- of remand. 

The Court has made clear that concerns of comity and 

federalism say that we should construe 1447 in favor of 

remand and I believe that that should extend to the 

concept of the whole delay of concept and shuttling.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then -- when what you are 

doing is that you are using the label "subject manager 

jurisdiction" in a way that seems to me, that -- there 

are many categories that -- could be ambiguous at the 

edges, but not subject matter jurisdiction. Subject 

matter jurisdiction means court, you have no power, 

period. There's no diversity, there's no Federal 

question, there's no other basis for the Federal Court 

to exercise jurisdiction; and to say, "Well, we can 

extend the label subject matter jurisdiction to include 

a case where the district court chooses not to hear 

several claims, even though it has jurisdiction over 

them." I think is a -- is a -- a misapplication of the 

notion subject matter jurisdiction.

 MR. ALLISON: It is -- it is a difficult, a 

difficult conundrum. I think maybe all conundra are 

difficult, but this one particularly. And, Justice 

Ginsburg, in the opinion that you wrote for the Court in 

the RBOC case, you very clearly pointed out that the

Official - Subject to Final Review 

word "jurisdiction" is used in a variety of ways by 

legal scholars --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but not subject 

matter jurisdiction. Jurisdiction -- personal 

jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction. When I did 

in -- what I did in -- Arbaugh was explain that all 

kinds of things like time limits on when you can sue, 

have been labeled jurisdictional and mandatory, when 

they are not. They are simply statutes of limitation.

 MR. ALLISON: That -- that is correct, but 

that is -- that is the nature of the problem -- that is 

the nature of the problems that this Court confronted in 

Kircher and Powerex -- again this is by analogy only. 

We are not concerned about labels like that, if the 

district court believes that it was remanding the case 

because it lacked jurisdiction.

 But I'm coming back to subject matter 

jurisdiction, and I have found no case in this Court 

that has given a definition -- Chicago with its 

mandatory language was the closest I was able to find.

 The Koffski case out of the Seventh Circuit 

is the one case I was able to find from a higher court 

that said that supplemental jurisdiction is technically 

a form of subject matter jurisdiction. What we argue --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Why is it only technical?

It says court, you can exercise power. Subject matter 

jurisdiction is defined as the court has to hear a given 

controversy, and under supplemental jurisdiction, there 

is undoubted power in the district court to hear those 

claims.

 MR. ALLISON: In a -- certainly I think in a 

textbook sense, that is what subject matter -- when the 

world is divided between subject matter and personal and 

third, territorial, which I think is a relation -- has 

relation to personal -- when the world is divided along 

those lines, then subject matter takes on the broadest 

possible meaning, but we have conflicting broad 

policies. On the one hand, we have a broad definition 

of subject matter definition; on the other hand we have 

a statute which should be construed to favor remand at 

almost all lawful cost.

 And -- and subject matter, if we step back 

from our -- our dichotomy, personal and subject matter, 

subject matter also means, as -- as Your Honor said at 

the beginning of this argument, something that is --

that is a subject with which the Federal courts should 

be concerned, and on which they should expend their 

resources; and we now have the circuit courts hearing 

appeals from decisions, discretionary decisions because 

they are technically within the realm of subject matter

jurisdiction. But clearly, State law claims are not the 

subject matter with which the Federal courts should 

routinely be concerned, and that's why United Mine 

Workers -- and Cohill echoed it -- says, these claims 

should be sent back, and Cohill even -- both cases even 

said that the propriety of remanding the claims should 

be reviewed at every stage in the litigation. That --

that I think presents us a pretty strong policy by this 

Court that remand is to be indulged at almost any lawful 

cost.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: You put it in terms in 

your brief, if I understood your position correctly, 

yes, there is subject matter jurisdiction over 

supplemental claims, but once the district court chooses 

not to exercise that jurisdiction, it -- and these were 

the words you used -- it divests itself of jurisdiction.

 MR. ALLISON: Yes. The -- the argument --

and I was attempting to make a technical argument in the 

brief, and I think today I'm speaking in slightly more 

global terms -- but the technical argument is that when 

a district court makes a decision, in the words of 

Gibbs, that it would be inappropriate to exercise 

jurisdiction over those claims, then the claims are to 

be remanded.

mind?

 MR. ALLISON: Justice Alito, the question of 

whether a -- question of reviewability because the cases 

that we found that -- that talked about reconsideration 

talked about reconsideration only because there was the 

potential for review of these orders.

 I think the norm for a remanded case is that 

the order of remand is entered, and the order of remand 

is certified and mailed to the State court, and the 

district court no longer has jurisdiction at that point.

 Now, certainly it could reconsider as it's 

engaged in its decision process. It could go back and 

forth and reconsider it before it signs the order. But 

that's no different than -- than many other cases in 

which the court can make a discretionary decision that 

it has no jurisdiction. The only --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The discretionary 

decision is that it chooses not to hear the case. It's 

not that -- there is no discretion there. There's 

nothing discretionary about saying we have no 

jurisdiction. "We have no jurisdiction" means we have 

no power. So the -- the two are just at odds with each 

other. No power, yes power, but we choose not to 

exercise it.

 MR. ALLISON: And I think -- I think that

the -- again, the purpose of the review bar as it's been 

expressed for over a hundred years has been to trust 

district judges to make these decisions and then get the 

case where it needs to be to be resolved on its merits. 

So to say that the court chooses not to hear the case, 

it -- it suggests something a little bit less gray than 

the decision that I believe the court would make when it 

decides that it's inappropriate to hear the case, in the 

words of Gibbs.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: You -- you think that 

choosing not to hear is distinguishable from a decision 

that it is inappropriate to hear?

 MR. ALLISON: I -- I meant only to suggest 

that it is not a -- it is not a choice. It is a -- not 

a -- an ill-considered choice. Certainly, there's a 

choice involved in the decision that it would be 

inappropriate. But I don't see -- and I -- I wanted to 

resist a rhetorical question, but then I don't see how 

anyone could say when a court is faced with -- with only 

State-law claims that it could either decide or not and 

it decides it would be inappropriate to retain 

jurisdiction over those claims, that somehow it should 

retain jurisdiction over those claims.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that would argue 

for a highly deferential standard of review, respecting

the district judge's determination that it's not what --

it hasn't invested any time in these questions, and it 

shouldn't because they are purely state-law questions. 

That's -- but that's something quite different from --

from a -- the -- the terminology that you used is 

troublesome because a court doesn't have power to divest 

itself of jurisdiction.

 If Congress conferred jurisdiction, it has 

it, and the Court can't divest itself of that. It can, 

if Congress permits it, decline to exercise 

jurisdiction, but a court is not capable of divesting 

itself of jurisdiction.

 MR. ALLISON: I believe -- well -- and --

and this is a mechanical argument, but I believe that 

when the court makes the decision and then -- and then 

anticipates the remand, that that is divesting itself of 

jurisdiction. And perhaps it was -- perhaps it was a 

poor -- a poor word choice.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: But even -- even on your 

analysis it seems to me that the -- the cart is before 

the horse, because it is -- it is not remanding because 

it does not have jurisdiction. What you are saying is 

that after it remands, it loses jurisdiction, and those 

are two very distinct categories.

 The -- the premise for the declaration that

it does not have jurisdiction is a premise that even on 

your argument does not arise until a following 

agreement. So there's no way you can fit it, it seems 

to me, into the category of -- of remanding because at 

the point of deciding to remand it has no jurisdiction. 

That, in fact, is false.

 MR. ALLISON: It is simply a question, I 

think, of -- of the choice of the word "divest" and what 

that means. I would -- I would analogize in order to 

perhaps make it seem more -- more accurate -- I would 

analogize it to what a district court now can do under 

section 1447(e) where it makes a decision in applying 

the law and using its discretion to allow joinder of a 

nondiverse party. That would then destroy diversity and 

require the case to be remanded.

 And I would say in that case that the court 

makes a decision that divests it of jurisdiction, and it 

is very technical to say that -- - that, yes, it lacks 

jurisdiction as soon as it enters the order admitting 

that party to the case. But that may very well be the 

same order that remands the case to the State court.

 But I -- I do -- I do see that there is 

power. And if the case is going to turn on power, as 

the Court -- or some of the language in Powerex 

suggested that it might, then I don't know that we -- I

don't know that we make much headway. But I -- I -- I 

see 1447(c) lacks subject-matter jurisdiction as being 

broad enough to comfortably take in the situation where 

the State law claims not really within the subject 

matter of the district court's power are determined 

inappropriate for that court to hear and sent back.

 And it would bring us that much closer to 

realizing the purpose of the review bar that has existed 

since 1887, taking a category of cases out of the 

jurisdiction of the circuit courts.

 I -- I had wanted to offer the Court some 

statistics, as maybe proof-of-law professors might, 

about the number of cases that are heard on this type of 

appeal. I can say that the cases that we found in our 

footnotes 18 through 20 represent something close to the 

universe of cases in which discretion was found to be 

abused. And that abuse of discretion is nowhere near as 

egregious as the legal errors that a district court 

might commit in making erroneous judgments that it has 

no jurisdiction which were nonetheless subjected to the 

review bar in Kircher and Powerex.

 If there are no further questions, I will 

stop now.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

Thank you. Mr. Rhodes, you have four minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GLENN W. RHODES

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. RHODES: I just had a few quick points I 

would like to bring up.

 First, I would just like to reiterate that 

when Congress enacted 1367, that gave it Article III 

jurisdiction in those matters, just as 1331 and 1332 do. 

I would also like to reiterate that -- that stare 

decisis should be maintained over this statutory 

interpretation because it has proved to be workable 

rather than not workable.

 Again, the circuit courts -- even though as 

Mr. Chief Justice has iterated that they have to follow 

this, they have found it to be a workable framework. 

And, again, as the Court expressed in Powerex, they 

agreed that in Quackenbush that Thermtron was not 

altered. And Congress has -- has seemingly ratified 

this Court's interpretation in Thermtron, and it has 

been applied in Quackenbush.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose, though, 

if it would be an abuse of discretion for the district 

court to retain jurisdiction, then maybe there is --

there never was jurisdiction, right? You said they have 

discretion to exercise or not. If it turns out they 

don't have discretion to exercise, you know, because

it's a huge State claim and a tiny Federal claim, why 

wouldn't that properly be regarded as an absence of 

jurisdiction?

 MR. RHODES: My response to that, Mr. Chief 

Justice, is that until a court decides that it was an 

abuse of discretion, the district court had jurisdiction 

under 1367(c) to either exercise that power or not 

exercise that power.

 And unless there's any further questions for 

me, I ask that the brief -- this be remanded to the 

Federal circuit to decide on the merits of the appeal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:17 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitle matter was submitted.)
