 (10:01 a.m.)

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Boas, the Court will hear 

argument in Small against the United States. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. BOAS

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. BOAS: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court:

 This case presents the issue of whether, when 

deciding the meaning of a statute, we will focus, as the 

Government suggests, on two words only, any court, or 

whether we will look at the statute as a whole, whether we 

will consider the statute as a symmetrical and coherent 

regulatory scheme and decide the meaning of the statute by 

appreciating how sections relate to one another. 

In this particular case, 922(g)(1) of 18 U.S. 

Code is a -- represents a merger of two old sections, 

title IV and title VII, that were passed in 1968 in the 

Omnibus Crime Control Act. In -- in those -- in that 

statute, we had two redundant and overlapping sections, 

and one talked about prohibiting persons who have been 

convicted in any court of a crime punishable by more than 

a year. One, title VII, talked about prohibiting persons 

convicted in any court of the United States or a State of 

a felony. There were different penalties, slightly

different classes of people. Title IV focused more on the 

receiver; title VII more on the possessor. But nothing --

nothing about the -- these two titles, about the 

legislative history suggests that Congress at any time 

meant something different from the term, any court, in 

title IV and any court of the United States in title VII.

 And when these two were merged in 1986 in the 

Firearms Owners' Protection Act, again, nothing suggests, 

nothing in the comments, nothing in the statute, that 

these two terms -- that the elimination of the language, 

any court of the United States, was --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: Well, I guess we have held, 

though, several times that Congress meant to define very 

broadly when it enacted felon in possession of firearm 

statutes. Did we not?

 MR. BOAS: That's -- that's correct, Justice 

O'Connor. However --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR: So it makes it a tougher case 

when you use the word any because we've given the -- the 

word any generally a broad definition.

 MR. BOAS: Well, earlier this year in the Nixon 

case, this Court said that when we look at any -- and that 

was a case dealing with the meaning of any entity. Did it 

mean any entity, public or private, or any private entity? 

The Court said any can and does mean different things

depending upon the setting, and the Court said when using 

it broadly would lead to strange and indeterminate 

results, we'll give it a more narrow reading, which the 

Court did.

 Now, you're right, Justice O'Connor. This Court 

has said that the purpose of the felon in possession 

statute was to be broad and sweeping, but the Government 

reiterates that view, citing repeatedly three cases, 

Scarborough, Bass, and Lewis, and all three of those cases 

in which the Court referred to Congress' comments and this 

Court's own comments about the broad sweep of the statute 

were 1202(a) cases. And so notwithstanding the fact that 

the Court said this is a broad statute, each one of those 

cases, Lewis, Bass, and Scarborough, were cases where by 

definition the prohibition was against persons convicted 

in any court of the United States or a State. So that 

language doesn't help the Government at all because those 

were 1202(a) cases which limited specifically the Court to 

any court of the United States. 

So to take the -- and I -- and -- the simplistic 

view that as the -- as the Fourth and Sixth Circuit did 

and as the Government does here, that any means any, 

without regard to the rest of the statute, is simply -- is 

-- is too narrow a focus.

 Let's look at the statute. It's true that the

word -- the term, the two words, any court, is not 

defined. But if we look in the definitions section, the 

term, crime punishable by more than a year, is defined. 

And so what we should really be focusing on is the phrase, 

convicted in any court of a crime punishable by more than 

a year. And that definition says the term, crime 

punishable by more than a year, excludes any State or 

Federal antitrust or business regulatory offense. 

Now, if we exclude from the definition of crime 

punishable by more than a year and the Government's -- if 

we exclude from that any State or Federal antitrust law 

and the Government's interpretation is adopted, then we're 

left with the anomalous result that if a person is 

convicted of an antitrust offense in this country, they're 

allowed to possess a firearm. If they're convicted of one 

in France or England, they can't. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Are there any such cases? I 

mean, I never heard actually --

MR. BOAS: No. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- when people -- no. I mean, 

are there any cases in which France or England has 

convicted people of an antitrust violation punishable by 

imprisonment for more than a year? I -- I didn't know 

that their antitrust laws had a criminal aspect, though I 

haven't looked it up.

 MR. BOAS: Nor have I --

JUSTICE BREYER: Fine. Well, I -- I've never 

heard if anyone in any foreign country, other than ours, 

though I gather my law clerk found that in Japan, in fact, 

Japan does have a criminal antitrust law. They may be the 

only ones outside the United States, and I don't know that 

anyone has ever been convicted under it because they're 

not too -- or they didn't used to be too fierce on 

antitrust enforcement.

 MR. BOAS: Well, 921(20) or --

JUSTICE BREYER: I'm just wondering how 

anomalous or your anomaly is. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. BOAS: Well, the -- the limitation not only 

excludes antitrust offenses, it excludes any business 

regulatory offense. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And are there such?

 MR. BOAS: Of course. I think --

JUSTICE BREYER: I mean, maybe.

 MR. BOAS: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: I don't -- I don't -- but I 

just -- are we sure that there -- that, you know, that 

this anomaly exists?

 MR. BOAS: I'm certain that there are 

business regulatory crimes throughout the world.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Why did they say any State or 

Federal? I mean, in -- in a way this provision -- you --

you may say that the -- that the substantive effect of the 

provision supports your interpretation, but the text of 

the provision supports the Government's --

MR. BOAS: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- because if any only means 

State or Federal, there was no need to say State or 

Federal in this provision. You could have simply said any 

in this provision, just as you said it elsewhere. So one 

would think that they said State or Federal because they 

wanted to exclude foreign antitrust matters.

 MR. BOAS: Well, this same limitation, Justice 

Scalia, existed as a limitation under 1202(a) where any 

court said any State or Federal court and the exclusion 

said any State or Federal court. It's consistent --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I don't care how it got 

there. I'm just saying there -- there -- if -- if any 

means what you said it means, namely State or Federal, 

there would have been no need to limit this other 

provision to State or Federal because the whole statute 

would only cover State or Federal. 

MR. BOAS: Well, but at some point in the 

statute, Congress has to give an indication of their 

intent, and this is where it is.

 For example, there's another limitation 

immediately following it which says it shall also not 

include any State offense which is described as a 

misdemeanor in the State and carries no more than 2 years.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: No. Well, but -- but Justice 

Scalia's point -- and I -- I think he's correct -- is that 

this cuts at least as much in favor of the Government as 

you and probably more because you would make Federal and 

State unnecessary surplus.

 MR. BOAS: Well, there has to be some 

indication --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't -- you don't set 

forth the main qualification to the main definition in a 

-- in a later subsection.

 MR. BOAS: Well, if we go further with 921(20), 

there's another limitation that again clearly deals with 

States, and that's the restoration of civil rights 

provision. The Government concedes in their brief -- and 

that was an effort to essentially statutorily reverse the 

Dickerson v. Banner Institute case -- that that applies to 

State situations. The idea that if a person receives a 

State pardon or his record is expunged, that wouldn't be a 

disqualifying factor. And they talk about the law of the 

foreign state being what determines whether it's a 

conviction or not. Now, clearly we're not looking at

going to some pardon process in Germany or Uruguay to 

decide whether a person still has a conviction. 

Another part of the statute that's very clear, 

924(e)(1). That's the armed career criminal section. 

That section says that if a person's who's convicted under 

922(g)(1), our statute, and has three prior serious drug 

convictions in a court described in 922(g)(1), then they 

get 15 years. Now, that definition of serious drug 

conviction is a State or Federal conviction. 

Now, let's flip over to 21 U.S.C. 802(44), the 

drug statute where you have a similar recidivist type of 

statute where you go from a 5-year mandatory to a 10-year 

mandatory if you have a prior drug conviction. There in 

802(44), a serious drug offense is defined as a State, 

Federal, or foreign drug offense. So we see that Congress 

can differentiate when it wants to.

 Now, they're --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Would -- would you concede 

that -- that this is at least sloppy drafting? Because 

they said any in one place, they said State or Federal in 

other places. Shouldn't they be -- be consistent in their 

terminology?

 MR. BOAS: Well, perhaps they should be more 

consistent, Justice Ginsburg, but the overall -- I mean, 

if you go down the list of the prohibitions in 922(g)(1),

you can see that the thrust of this is -- is to deal with 

domestic situations. There's one that says you can't own 

a firearm if you're a -- a fugitive from law -- a fugitive 

from justice. That's specifically defined as a fugitive 

from another State within the United States. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Boas, I think you make a 

strong argument that Congress probably didn't think of 

this particular problem. Do you suppose if at the 

hearings before the committee, the process of the 

legislation, some witness came in and said, do you realize 

this language is so broad it will cover the person who is 

convicted of a felony in Japan, as well as person who's 

convicted of a felony in Illinois, do you think they would 

have modified the statute?

 MR. BOAS: I think they would have. I think 

that -- I don't concede that there was really a need to, 

but I think they would have because they would have said 

it's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, there would have been a 

need to under your view now.

 MR. BOAS: That's right. But they would have 

historically going back to '68 and before, we always 

intended this to just cover domestic situations. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: But I suppose somebody on the 

committee might have said, well, we don't want this kind

of person to have a gun, and the fact he's convicted in 

Japan rather than in Brooklyn really doesn't make any 

difference with regard to the purpose of the statute.

 MR. BOAS: If the individual is convicted in 

Japan, Justice Stevens, then he would not be under our 

immigration laws allowed to come to this country, and if 

he did come --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, but this person --

MR. BOAS: -- he'd be an illegal alien.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But the defendant in this case 

was convicted in Japan and he somehow got to the United 

States. 

MR. BOAS: Well, because he's an American 

citizen. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well --

MR. BOAS: So -- but Congress can't cure every 

problem that exists in the world, and this statute is 

fairly comprehensive. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Are people really not allowed 

to come in if they've been convicted of any crime?

 MR. BOAS: Any crime that carries more than a 

year basically. It's pretty --

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose it was a crime like not 

wearing a veil if you're a woman in a country that --

suppose it was a crime like criticizing the government if

you were in Soviet Russia. Suppose it was a crime like --

you know, there are all kinds of crimes that we -- we 

would never consider crimes --

MR. BOAS: Well, that's --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- and in other countries there 

are -- we don't let anyone in if they've done any of those 

things?

 MR. BOAS: No. Well, those people will probably 

be seeking political asylum. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn --

under the Government's interpretation, Nobel Prize winners 

would be precluded from -- Solzhenitsyn did 8 years in a 

Soviet prison because he said nasty things about Joseph 

Stalin. Two American women in Afghanistan, before the 

fall of the Taliban regime, were arrested and convicted 

because they possessed Bibles. Now, the Government says, 

well, these are anomalies. These don't occur often. But 

Congress had to be aware of the possibility of tinhorn 

dictatorships all over the world having court systems that 

were so devoid of due process that we have to take a look 

at whether we want to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the -- the court of 

appeals here said what it would -- it read in a check. It 

said it wouldn't read it to really mean any conviction. 

It had to be in a system that was fundamentally fair. 

Wasn't that what the court of appeals said?

 MR. BOAS: That's what they said, but -- but 

when and how do we decide that? There's another offense 

under 922(g) -- or under 922 that makes it a crime to 

give a false answer on a -- a firearms questionnaire when 

you go to buy the gun -- buy the gun. Now, what does the 

individual do? Does he say to the firearms dealer, do you 

have a list of countries where our Government has decided 

it's a fair enough system that I can say no -- yes, I have 

a conviction in view of the list that it's an unfair 

system so I can say yes, I have no -- or no, I have no 

convictions? 

I mean, it -- one of the reasons where we 

employ, for example, the rule of lenity, is -- is a person 

put on notice of what it is that's criminal and what is 

not. When does it come up that the system isn't fair 

enough to count? 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, I think -- let -- let's 

put, you know, the worst for you. If it were put to 

Congress, which would you prefer, that -- that 

Solzhenitsyn not be able to have a gun or that the worst 

kind of violent criminal convicted and imprisoned and 

escaped from a foreign country who manages to get into 

this country can go in and buy a gun? Which -- which of 

these two would you prefer? And I think I'd say, well, 

you know, it's tough on Solzhenitsyn he can't own a gun,

but he'll probably get over it. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. BOAS: Well, what I'd prefer and what the 

statute means aren't necessarily the same thing, Your 

Honor. I'd prefer violent criminals who are dangerous 

not to have guns. But again, that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Suppose you put the question to 

Congress, which would you prefer? Would you prefer the 

occasional person who's been convicted of a foreign court, 

comes over here, that this statute doesn't apply to him, 

or would you prefer that all the refugees from Eastern 

Europe and people who come from Arab countries and people 

who come from countries that have quite different systems 

in places all over the world discover that suddenly 

they're felons because of things they never would have 

dreamt of because they were perhaps convicted of selling 

gasoline on the open market or perhaps they were convicted 

of any of these religious crimes we've talked about, 

selling a Bible? Suppose you put that question to 

Congress.

 MR. BOAS: I think Congress would say the perils 

and problems that exist by a blanket inclusion without any 

method of determining which count and which don't count of 

foreign convictions are too great. Now --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, if it's a -- if it's a

matter of notice and -- then that's a separate issue. 

Plus the Government, it seems to me, should put on its 

form that this includes foreign conviction, and that 

solves that problem. 

MR. BOAS: Well, but what if it's a foreign 

conviction where there's no due process? Is there a 

checklist that in that foreign conviction, did you have a 

jury, did you have the right to confront your accuser, did 

you have the right to remain silent? I mean, we all seem 

to realize that the Government's position that any 

conviction anywhere is too stark a place. And again --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May -- may we go back to the 

-- the choice that you were given by Justice Scalia first 

and then Justice Breyer? I thought that someone who comes 

in here illegally and possesses a gun commits an offense.

 MR. BOAS: That's right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: So -- so there's not 

-- Congress would say to that hypothetical, we've got a 

third choice, much more sensible. Anybody who sneaks in 

here without permission and has a gun --

MR. BOAS: That's correct. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- commits a crime.

 MR. BOAS: That's one of the subsections of 

922(g)(5). Anybody who's an illegal alien here illegally 

can't have a gun. Anyone --

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That doesn't cover Americans,

MR. BOAS: No. It doesn't cover --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- who go -- go and commit 

crimes abroad, are convicted abroad, and -- and come back 

to home sweet home and then get a gun. I mean, that seems 

to me extraordinary. 

MR. BOAS: That -- I didn't hear your --

JUSTICE SCALIA: That seems to me extraordinary. 

I don't think Congress would have wanted that.

 MR. BOAS: Well, I don't think Congress can be 

said to have intended or envisioned that they would cure 

every problem in the world. It's a very, very narrow 

category of American citizens convicted abroad who come 

back here. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: I think if there was a problem 

that -- that they were going to leave unsolved, it is less 

likely the problem of having an American citizen killed by 

a gun toted by somebody who has been convicted of a crime 

abroad than it is the problem of somebody having been 

convicted abroad of some silly crime like wearing a veil 

or not wearing a veil or something else. If -- if it's 

either of those two problems that they meant to leave 

overlooked, I would say it's the latter. They might well 

have said, well, the courts will take care of that.

 MR. BOAS: Well, Your Honor, it's unclear what 

-- what their thought process was in this matter. But I 

can say this, that the narrow category that escapes the 

coverage of this statute -- there's nothing to indicate 

anywhere in any of the debates, in the language of the 

statute that that's what Congress intended. 

And again, if you look at the overall view here, 

I mean, fugitive from justice. It's limited to someone 

from the State. Person -- let's look at 922(g)(9). Very 

clear, incapable of misunderstanding. The same prefatory 

language. A person convicted in any court -- exactly the 

same, and it ends with the same language -- cannot ship, 

possess, receive. And what does it say? Instead of 

saying convicted of a crime punishable by more than a 

year, it says convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic 

violence. And that's defined as a State or Federal 

misdemeanor. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Where -- where is that defined?

 MR. BOAS: That's defined in 921(a)(33), Your 

Honor. It's specifically limited.

 Now, here we are. A person who beats his wife 

in England can have a gun in this country, but a person 

who commits a business regulatory offense in Germany 

can't. It makes no sense. The -- it -- it's a very clear 

statement by Congress that a misdemeanor crime of domestic

violence -- they're only intending it to be a State or 

Federal crime. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Once again, that -- that cuts 

both ways. Why would they -- if the text reads the way 

you say it reads, why did they have to say is a 

misdemeanor under Federal or State law? Because it 

wouldn't have mattered. The only courts -- the only 

convictions that would be covered would be Federal or 

State convictions. They would not need that -- that 

qualification. 

MR. BOAS: At -- at some point a person has to 

be told what Congress was intending. This language goes 

back to '68 where the language in the exclusion limiting 

it to State -- excluding Federal and State convictions 

matched the language in the term, any court, in 1202(a), 

which was title VII. They were -- they were complementing 

each other.

 And -- and if you look at even as far back as 

the Batchelder decision in the '70's from this Court, the 

Court talked about these two being redundant, overlapping, 

the only difference being that one uses the term felony, 

one uses the term crime punishable by more than a year. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Boas, when they combined 

these two --

MR. BOAS: Yes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and ones -- the 1202 did 

say Federal or State -- they made other changes, 

harmonizations. In the explanation of their consolidation 

of the two sections, to what extent did they discuss 

changes and the reasons for them?

 MR. BOAS: The -- they made no discussion of the 

reason for taking out the language, of the United States 

or of any State, and what they -- the only language was 

that we're intending to merge these into one statute --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But they did -- they did 

explain other things --

MR. BOAS: Yes. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- other changes, but this 

one -- there's silence --

MR. BOAS: Exactly. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- as far as I understand. 

MR. BOAS: And -- and by keeping in the 

exclusions, by -- by looking at 924(e)(1) where it --

what's very important to me is that 924(e)(1) says if you 

have three prior drug -- serious drug offenses in a court 

referred to in 922(g)(1), you get 15 years. Those three 

prior three drug offenses in a court referred to in 

922(g)(1) are State or Federal drug offenses by 

definition. It seems to me that it really couldn't be any 

more clear.

 And frankly, to the extent it's not totally 

clear and it could go either way, I think then the rule of 

lenity requires that it be decided with a more narrow 

construction, that is, that any court meant any court of 

the State or of the United States. 

I believe it was in the -- in the '90's when 

this Court's opinion, authored by Justice Thomas in I 

think it was called Alvarez-Sanchez, dealt with a statute, 

3105 dealing with the admissibility of confessions in 

Federal cases and that they won't be inadmissible if 

they're taken by any law enforcement official more than 6 

hours after the arrest. And the issue what does any mean 

in terms of any law enforcement official. And the Court 

said it means any State or Federal law enforcement 

official. Now, it didn't have to reach the issue of 

whether it included foreign law enforcement officials, but 

certain things are obvious without an -- an explanation. 

And you're right. There was some sloppy 

drafting here and it could have been more clear, but when 

we look at the statute as a whole and try to harmonize the 

various parts of that statute, it would be almost absurd 

to think, when we look -- and -- and maybe these anomalies 

won't occur all the time, as you point out, Justice 

Breyer, but it would almost be absurd to think that with 

all of these limitations, exclusions, when we run down the

list under 922(g)(1), that Congress was talking about any 

court in the world. Now --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Let me -- let me ask you the 

question the -- the Chief Justice would ask, were he here, 

because he always asked this kind of a question. What --

if you had to pick your best case of ours which 

interpreted the word any in the way that you would like us 

to interpret here, what's -- what's the best case you 

have?

 MR. BOAS: I'd say -- that's -- there's a 

question --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's a good question. He asks 

good questions. 

MR. BOAS: It's a good question. 

(Laughter.) 

MR. BOAS: I'd say the Nixon case decided this 

year which said that any can and does mean different 

things depending upon the setting and whether it works 

strange and indeterminate results would be one of my best 

cases. There's -- when I sit down, I'll probably think of 

a better one, but --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe you can think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: How -- how about --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Maybe you can think of a 

unanimous case.

 MR. BOAS: Well --


(Laughter.) 


JUSTICE GINSBURG: And this is one I'm -- I'm


surprised that you didn't cite, but it -- I don't think 

you did -- EEOC against Arabian American Oil Company, 

where the wording of the statute was anyplace outside the 

United States, title VII coverage, and this Court held 

that anyplace outside the United States did not mean that 

a U.S. employer operating abroad had to abide by the anti-

discrimination norms with respect to hiring in some place 

abroad because Congress was thinking in terms of the 

inter-State sitting -- setting and not 

international. 

MR. BOAS: Well, I -- I'm not familiar with that 

case. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That -- that was a decision 

by the Chief. So --

(Laughter.) 

MR. BOAS: That's a good one -- that's a good one 

too, Judge -- Justice.

 I -- I -- there's -- there's another case that 

I'd refer to which is the -- the Gonzales case, which is 

cited by the Government. Gonzales is interesting because 

it deals with 924(c)(1), which is the section that says 

you get 5 consecutive years if you're convicted of -- 5

years consecutive to any other sentence if you're 

convicted of possessing a firearm during the course of a 

serious drug offense. And in that case, the Court 

concluded that any other sentence meant any State or 

Federal sentence, not just a Federal sentence.

 Now, the Government might argue that that helps 

them because the -- the defendant in that case wanted it 

to be limited to any Federal sentence because he was 

serving a State sentence, and the question was would the 5 

years for the 924 violation be consecutive or concurrent, 

as the trial court gave it. 

But it -- what the Court did was say any depends 

on the context of the rest of the statute. And here, we 

think it means State and Federal. They didn't talk about 

foreign convictions.

 You know, it's interesting. It's ironic that --

that while we're debating how American citizens should be 

impacted by foreign convictions, the administration is 

unwilling to sign the treaty that would make American 

citizens subject to the International Criminal Court 

because there's concern about what would happen to 

Americans abroad, even in that court, not in a court in --

in Uruguay or in North Korea, but in the International 

Criminal Court. 

In fact, in the preliminary findings of the FOPA

statute, the -- the Congress said -- and this Court 

doesn't have to decide and I'm not asking the Court to 

decide the Second Amendment issue, but Congress found the 

Second Amendment was a fundamental constitutional right. 

And the name of the statute is the Firearms Owners' 

Protection Act. Congress had in mind protecting the 

owners of firearms when necessary, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You call that FOPA? That's the 

name of the statute? 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA: It's an unfortunate acronym, 

isn't it? 

(Laughter.) 

MR. BOAS: That's right. The spelling is a 

little bit different, Justice Scalia. 

But Congress -- the -- the name of the statute 

tells you something about Congress' intent. The otherwise 

licit and blameless activity of possessing a firearm isn't 

the equivalent of selling drugs. Now, maybe if you have a 

prior drug offense and you're a drug dealer, under 802 of 

21, Congress said you get your sentence doubled whether 

it's a State, Federal, or foreign conviction, but under 

924(e) for a conviction under a court defined in 

922(g)(1), the prior only ups your sentence if it's a 

State or Federal conviction. We can't ignore the overall

statutory scheme here, which time and time again refers to 

domestic matters. 

The Government in their brief says foreign 

convictions are used all the time, and they give three 

examples. They say we recognize them for the purpose of 

extraditing American citizens. They say we recognize them 

because if you're convicted of a -- a sex offense in 

certain foreign countries, you have to register here. And 

they say we recognize them -- I forget what their third 

reason is. But there's no example that they gave or that 

they can give where a foreign conviction is ever used 

anywhere else in this country as an element of the crime. 

I mean, it's used for recidivist purposes and State courts 

have debated back and forth whether we're going to double 

somebody's sentence because of a foreign conviction, but 

it's never used anywhere else as an element of the crime. 

This -- this would be a first, and it's pretty 

significant. 

To me it's ironic that the Sentencing Commission 

said you can't use a foreign conviction simply to up 

somebody a few months in the guidelines. But the 

Government here argues that we can use it to satisfy an 

element of the crime --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Recidivism is an element of the 

crime. If -- if you have a crime of, you know, repeated

felony, recidivism is an element.

 MR. BOAS: Well, that -- that's correct, Your 

Honor. Of course, the -- it's an exception under Apprendi 

that the -- the prior crime. But what -- what I'm saying 

is it's -- it's a slightly different situation in terms of 

it being -- I know we have Blakely and the whole 

sentencing factor issue. But it -- it's a slightly 

different use of a prior and making -- in other -- in all 

those cases, the -- it's a crime whether or not you have a 

felony. The felony might make it a more serious crime. 

In our case, this isn't a crime without this 

felony. That's the thing that makes it a crime. And what 

I'm saying is the only situation we have where something 

that's otherwise blameless conduct becomes a crime is the 

use of a felony. There's no other situation where a 

foreign felony is employed or has been employed in that 

situation. 

If there's no other questions, I'd like to, if 

it would please the Court, reserve the --

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm sorry. You've exhausted 

your time.

 MS. MILLETT: Justice Stevens, and may it please 

the Court:

 Justice Scalia, you asked about what case we 

would want to adopt and be our strongest case on the 

meaning of the word any in the statute, and my answer to 

that question, although I take the liberty of answering 

it, though you didn't ask me --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You can ask it as well --

(Laughter.) 

MS. MILLETT: -- is the Gonzales case where this 

Court said that the word any in the gun control law, in 

this context, in this framework means, read naturally --

I'm quoting here. Read naturally, the word any has an 

expansive meaning, that is, one or some indiscriminately 

of whatever kind. 

This is not, Justice Ginsburg, a statute where 

Congress wrote sloppily. In fact, in Barrett and 

Huddleston, this Court specifically said and noted that 

excruciating care with which Congress wrote title IV, 

section --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There is -- there's an 

overarching concern and I'll -- I'd like to put it to you 

right from the beginning. When a legislature legislates, 

be it the State or Federal Government, it is generally 

thinking in terms of its own domain, its own bailiwick.

When Congress legislates, it's thinking about the United 

States. Sometimes it's thinking about abroad, but most of 

the time when it is, it says so. 

And we have a number of cases, not just the 

Arabian American Oil Company. I mean, that -- the 

language of title VII was between a State and anyplace 

outside thereof, anyplace outside thereof. And in that 

very case, the Chief made the point that I'm putting to 

you now, that Congress thinks about the United States, our 

country, and if it means to say something that will take 

in other places in the world, it says so clearly. And we 

don't make the assumption that Congress was intending to 

have any extraterritorial flip to its law unless it tells 

us that.

 That's my overall concern about the Government's 

position in this case.

 MS. MILLETT: Justice Ginsburg, this is not an 

extraterritorial application of a statute. This regulates 

a threat to American public safety within the United 

States by someone within the United States based on their 

conduct, possession of a firearm by a dangerous person 

within the United States. That is not extraterritorial 

application of the law. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes, but --

MS. MILLETT: That's no more --

 JUSTICE STEVENS: -- but let me just interrupt 

on your -- your best case suggestion. I don't think the 

test is when has the word any been used in different ways, 

but has the word any court ever been used by Congress to 

include foreign courts.

 MS. MILLETT: The -- the phrase convicted in any 

court --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No. I'm asking about just the 

words, any court. What's your best case for the 

proposition that that would normally be construed by 

Congress to include foreign courts?

 MS. MILLETT: I don't -- I don't have a case 

that specifically talks about --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You don't have a case. 

MS. MILLETT: -- that yet, but if I can -- if I 

can explain why the phrase convicted in any court --

because any court -- the -- the problem is you're not 

-- there's not a case for that. The word, any court, that 

-- those two words appear in a lot of places in the United 

States Code. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And do they ever refer to 

foreign courts? That's the question. 

MS. MILLETT: The -- not -- not that I'm aware 

of, but -- but they don't -- it -- it doesn't address it 

one way or the other. Most of the times, the vast

majority of the times that you see any court in the United 

States, it -- in the United States Code, it's followed by 

qualifying terms.

 What's very important here is that the phrase 

convicted in any court without qualification. There's 

lots of any courts in the United States --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But the reason you often need 

qualification is there's -- there's sort of a basic 

question, does this include State courts as well as -- as 

well as Federal, and it's often necessary to spell it out 

one way or the other. But I don't -- I'm not aware of any 

precedent for trying to decide whether it also embraces 

foreign courts.

 MS. MILLETT: Justice Stevens, if I could make 

two points. Again, convicted in any court is rarely 

employed by Congress. Rarely. And we've cited in our 

brief on the occasions it has been employed, the context 

and structure are wholly consistent with including foreign 

judgments. The PATRIOT Act created a ban on the 

possession of biological agents or toxins, and it -- it 

picked up this same phrase and put it in there, and I 

think it is -- would -- and that is also a statute that in 

a separate provision has extraterritorial application. 

JUSTICE BREYER: How many times have you used 

this statute to go after people who were convicted in a

foreign court?

 MS. MILLETT: It -- it's -- I can't give you an 

exact number because we --

JUSTICE BREYER: About, approximate.

 MS. MILLETT: -- we don't know about the ones 

that we never hear about. 

JUSTICE BREYER: More like 100, more like 50, 

more like 10, more like 5? About how many?

 MS. MILLETT: It's -- it's not that -- I would 

-- I would say there's probably 10 to a dozen, but I -- I 

have to --

JUSTICE BREYER: 10 to a dozen over how long a 

period of time? 20 years, 18 years?

 MS. MILLETT: Since 1968. It's been on the 

books since 1968. 

JUSTICE BREYER: '68. Now -- so 35-40 years.

 Now -- now, how many times do you think that 

people -- I mean, the -- the -- if you've used it only a 

dozen times or so in about 40 years, then it doesn't sound 

like a major threat. What I'm weighing against that is 

the possibility that people are really convicted abroad of 

selling Bibles. That really does happen, and there really 

were economic crimes in 1968 in all the Eastern European 

countries, and these aren't fanciful examples I've been 

giving you.

 And so if you were in Congress -- or -- or why 

do you think that Congress would have wanted to get the 

courts into the mess of trying to decide why wouldn't 

those crimes be covered and were the procedures fair? And 

we start distinguishing one country from another. And 

what are the procedures in the Ukraine or Kazakhstan 

anyway? I mean, my goodness, what a mess for the sake of 

a dozen cases in 40 years.

 MS. MILLETT: Justice Breyer -- and Justice 

Stevens, I do want to get back because I do have a lower 

court case that interprets any court in the way you 

discussed. I want to get back to that. 

But Justice Breyer, I understand this being a 

very important concern, and -- and there are no doubt 

particular applications that could seem unappealing, just 

as in Lewis v. United States where this Court held that an 

invalid, a patently unconstitutional State conviction 

counts for section 922(g)(1). The reason that the -- the 

convictions are covered here is Congress was not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Which was it? Just -- what 

was the case you just mentioned?

 MS. MILLETT: Lewis v. United States, and that 

is -- that's really our favorite case, although we like 

the word of -- definition Gonzales has for any. But in 

Lewis v. United States, this Court addressed the question

whether the ban on possession of firearms by someone 

convicted of, I'll say, a felony, a term of imprisonment 

of more than 1 year, applies to -- to convictions that are 

allegedly unconstitutional under State law or may, in 

fact, be unconstitutionally entered. They could have been 

the product of a coerced confession. The allegation there 

was lack of representation of counsel. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, that -- that example, 

which you gave in your brief, gave me this concern. The 

problem that you've just been describing, the State 

convictions that may be invalid but is being used under 

922, I regard that as a kind of a venue question because 

you can go back to the State that rendered the conviction 

and say, State, I was convicted in violation of the 

Constitution, give me my good habeas writ that I get --

can get from the State. Then I wipe out that conviction 

and I don't have it anymore.

 But the person who's been convicted, say, in 

whatever examples -- take -- Zimbabwe would be another 

example. Libya. To go back to that system and get a 

conviction expunged. That's why you can't use a case 

within the U.S. system where it's a question of where do 

you go to wipe out your prior conviction. And for someone 

abroad, there isn't that option. 

MS. MILLETT: Justice Ginsburg, in Daniels v.

United States, which dealt with 924, the sentencing 

enhancement provision, but it has a -- the parallel and 

incorporates 922(g)(1) convictions, this Court held -- a 

plurality of this Court held in divided opinions that -- in 

fact, that the -- the bar -- or that you still count an 

unconstitutional or allegedly unconstitutional State 

conviction, even if it was never appealed and that -- and 

there is no more opportunity for appeal. The time has 

passed. And under 922(g)(1), we also count. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- that's a 

question of waiver or forfeiture. Those are the ordinary 

rules that apply. 

MS. MILLETT: Yes, but that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But -- but there's a basic 

rule in civil as well as criminal procedure, that if you 

want to attack a judgment, you go where that judgment was 

rendered. And of course, you should abide by the timing 

rules of that, but that's just a very sensible thing 

within a federal union. If you're -- if you're attacking 

what State A does, go to State A, don't tell State C.

 MS. MILLETT: And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that -- that doesn't 

operate internationally. 

MS. MILLETT: Well, it does certainly in this 

case. He could have appealed his conviction in Japan and

he did not. So he had a forum to do that in. But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes, but you're not building 

that into your interpretation of the statute at all 

because you have said in your brief -- and correct me if 

I've got you wrong -- you don't like what the Third 

Circuit did. You say just the fact of the conviction 

counts. Don't investigate, court, whether it was a fair 

system that comports with fundamental notions of due 

process. Just see if there's a conviction anyplace in the 

world. And so what -- what you're telling me is that it 

doesn't matter that you didn't appeal because even if he 

were precluded from appealing for some reason that we 

would consider totally unfair, it doesn't matter on your 

view of this statute.

 MS. MILLETT: That -- that's right, Justice 

Ginsburg, and that is -- you know, the -- the statute also 

bars receipt of firearms by anyone who's under indictment. 

And that application applies even though you can't appeal, 

except for exceptional circumstances. You can't appeal an 

indictment. And the 922(g)(1) bar, this Court's decision 

in Lewis made clear, is that it still applies unless and 

until your conviction is overturned. So you don't have to 

have had a -- a conviction vetted through the appellate 

process before the bar attaches.

 In -- in the immigration context --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But that's -- that's standard 

for judgments anyway. When the judgment is final, it 

means you've gotten through the first -- it has preclusive 

effect. Almost always, when a judgment is overturned on 

appeal, then you go back to State 2 and say, look, it's 

been overturned on appeal, and at least in the civil side, 

almost always State 2 will say, okay, we'll give you post-

judgment relief because what we were relying on as our 

sister State judgment is no longer on the books. I can't 

imagine that in our criminal system it doesn't work the 

same way.

 MS. MILLETT: Well, certainly in immigration and 

extradition, you don't get to appeal the validity of your 

foreign conviction or the -- the processes that led to it. 

So this is not an alien concept.

 And it's very important to understand what 

Congress was doing here. This isn't --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm asking if it's alien in 

our criminal justice system, not in deportation, not in --

extradition is somebody who did somebody -- something 

abroad, and we don't send people just to anyplace. Don't 

we have to have a treaty?

 MS. MILLETT: Right. We have treaties with more 

than 100 countries and we don't -- and -- and the courts 

do not examine the fairness of the proceedings or --

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Because the person is going 

to be tried in that other system, and we have bound --

within our international system, we say we're part of a 

world community and we want Japan to extradite people who 

have done bad things here to the United States, and so 

similarly, we will extradite to Japan. We don't want them 

to look at our system and judge it. We're sending 

somebody to be tried there. So extradition is -- is 

something entirely different than --

MS. MILLETT: Although we -- we do also 

extradite, just to serve sentences, where there may have 

already been a trial that could be as flawed as anyone 

could conceive or articulate. So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, we have the check 

already that these are -- these are places with whom we want 

to do criminal justice business together. So --

MS. MILLETT: Well, what we have is the check 

that the political branches have decided that it's 

important to attach significance to foreign court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And then we have the -- we 

have the document where it's very clear we want to have 

extradition with the UK, with Japan. Here, you're relying 

on the word court, and you don't have it all spelled out 

like you do in an extradition treaty. And that's the 

problem here. Sure, if Congress had said we mean foreign

court, then that would be it, but it hasn't said that and 

we have to determine does it mean the same thing as it 

means in the extradition context or the deportation 

context where you have a clear statement that Congress 

means a tribunal abroad.

 MS. MILLETT: In fact, in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a) which 

-- which -- admissibility criterion for aliens, 

convictions of moral turpitude, there's no reference to 

whether it's a conviction by a foreign court or a domestic 

court. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But if somebody is coming 

into the country, somebody is asking to come in, any 

conviction that you're talking about, of course, refers to 

someplace abroad. 

MS. MILLETT: No. No, it doesn't, Justice 

Ginsburg, because frequently and throughout that same 

statute, it refers to convictions in the United States. A 

lot of times the reason for inadmissibility, including the 

Mariel Cubans cases this Court heard last month, is -- is 

convictions committed in the United States. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: May -- may I interrupt this --

MS. MILLETT: Now, surely the context --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- this colloquy to raise 

another question, if I may? Would you concede that there 

are some tribunals in the world that are comparable to

what you might call a kangaroo court that Congress would 

not have intended to include within the term court?

 MS. MILLETT: Yes, Justice Stevens. And I think 

that's an important thing here. There has been no 

contest, for obvious reasons -- we're dealing with Japan 

-- as to what Congress meant by court. And sometimes if 

it's Saddam Hussein's --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And how are we to decide 

whether such tribunal should be treated as a court within 

the meaning of the statute when there is no statutory 

definition of the term court?

 MS. MILLETT: Through traditional rules of 

statutory construction. I think that would involve 

looking at the other -- the -- the background that 

Congress would have enacted the statute against, first of 

all, and that -- that may well have -- it may not have 

been courts of just the United States because, as we know, 

Congress twice deleted that limitation from the statute.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But if you concede that there 

are some tribunals that are not courts within the meaning 

of the statute, are you not conceding that the word court 

is inherently ambiguous?

 MS. MILLETT: I -- I am -- I am conceding that 

-- that it has to be given meaning. I don't know that I 

would call it ambiguous, if we have to figure out. But I

-- what I will say is that the phrase --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But it's something less than 

the all-inclusive term, any court, in a literal sense.

 MS. MILLETT: Any -- it has to be -- it has to 

be a court capable of entering convictions. I don't -- I 

don't think it's ambiguous in a sense --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, it doesn't --

it's -- it's not a tennis court or an inner court. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. MILLETT: Right. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: If -- if somebody asked where 

this man was convicted, they'd say in a Japanese court.

 MS. MILLETT: Right. And -- and I think, in 

addition, we don't decide that a word is ambiguous just at 

looking at that word. We would look at the overall 

structure of the statute, and we would decide that it has 

to be a governmental entity capable of entering 

convictions. 

JUSTICE BREYER: You didn't really have a 

chance --

JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume that there's some 

prosecutorial discretion in the application of this 

statute. I mean, have you --

MS. MILLETT: Absolutely, Justice --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- have you prosecuted any --

any woman who tried to buy a firearm because she had been 

convicted of wearing -- not -- not wearing a veil?

 MS. MILLETT: No, Justice Scalia. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you think any United States 

attorney would do that?

 MS. MILLETT: I would hope not, Justice Scalia. 

I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Or -- or somebody who was 

convicted of treason in Cuba? You -- you think that --

that that would be a -- a case that would be prosecuted 

vigorously by a United States attorney? 

MS. MILLETT: I -- I wouldn't think so. I 

think --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Do you know any cases in which 

we've construed a statute narrowly on the ground that 

we're confident the prosecutor won't bring any such cases?

 MS. MILLETT: That -- well, again, just last --

this isn't -- this isn't quite the same context. But just 

this -- just last term in the Cheney case, this Court 

recognized the limitations on prosecutors. 

And in Atwater v. City of Lago Vista, in 

determining the scope of the Fourth Amendment and the 

capacity to arrest for misdemeanors, this Court recognized 

that not all checks have to come from the courts. They 

can come from the political process here.

 And it's very important to keep in mind that 

these hypothesized problems, bad applications, are that. 

Purely hypothesized. This has been on the books for 

almost 40 years.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But it's -- it's been on the 

books for so long with very, very few prosecutions. So 

it's one -- it's not exactly an urgent question. But it 

does seem to me if this -- this problem had been brought 

to the attention of Congress, they would have defined the 

term court, and I don't -- they haven't done that but 

probably because they didn't think of the problem. And 

you can argue, well, they surely would have wanted to have 

this particular person prosecuted, but would they have 

wanted everyone with every foreign court all over the 

world. That's the question. 

MS. MILLETT: And in Beecham v. United States, 

in Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court, this Court 

recognized there -- it was dealing with another issue, 

whether the jurisdiction that restores civil rights is 

different from the convicting jurisdiction. It said we 

don't have any way of knowing whether Congress thought 

about that. That's not the question. 

Congress passed a statute here. It passed a 

statute that's been written very carefully. It's passed a 

statute where the definition of the word any in the

statute has already been defined. And the -- what the 

statute has been used for is to prosecute exactly the 

people that Congress wanted to capture. It's 

international gun smugglers --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. --

MS. MILLETT: -- violent assailants --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, Ms. -- Ms. Millett, my --

my problem with that argument and I guess my basic problem 

with -- with the case is Congress did not just sort of 

stop when it got to the point that would support your 

Lewis argument. It went a step -- it went several steps 

further. But one of the steps further that it went to was 

-- was in -- in a certain fussiness about the definition 

of crime, and it said, well, we want to make sure that --

that no State or -- or Federal business criminals are --

are put at a disadvantage by this. It then accepted 

anything that a State might call a misdemeanor if it 

carried no more than 2 years. And it just seems very odd 

to me that Congress would have been that careful in 

putting these limitations on State and Federal crimes and 

would totally have ignored any category of crime under 

foreign law, any conviction under foreign law in -- in 

light of some of the hypotheses that have been thrown out 

this morning. It just seems strange that it would have 

ignored foreign law and foreign courts if it thought they

were included. 

MS. MILLETT: I don't think it's strange at all, 

Justice Souter, and that is because that the business 

exception, if I can call it that, is a carve-out. What 

you have here, in this Court's word, is a sweeping 

prophylaxis against the misuse of firearms. That's what 

this Court called it in Lewis, a sweeping prophylaxis. 

And what Congress did was back out --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, it called it that, but it 

didn't -- it didn't have this issue in front of it.

 MS. MILLETT: That's -- that's right. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: I -- I realize you've got the 

language, but it -- it wasn't addressing this issue.

 MS. MILLETT: Right, and -- and the language 

should be what counts most. But beyond that, you're 

talking about Congress --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, I was talking about our 

language. 

MS. MILLETT: Right. You --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But -- and I think that ought 

to count for a lot too. 

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, not too much.

 MS. MILLETT: But what Congress was doing there 

was backing out. It was making an exception, and it was

doing this against a backdrop of a lot of violence with 

guns. And so it makes sense that Congress would proceed 

carefully and deal with matters with which it was familiar 

and not want to carve out things that it wasn't familiar 

with. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: No, but how -- how familiar an 

example is it that price-fixers would -- would be placed 

in -- in a terrible position if they couldn't carry guns? 

I mean, that was not a pressing problem, so far as I know. 

And yet, Congress dealt with it. 

MS. MILLETT: Well, the problem --

JUSTICE SOUTER: And if it can deal with a 

problem that is as little pressing as that, it seems odd 

that it would not have averted in any way to equally non-

pressing problems under -- under foreign convictions if 

that's what they had in mind.

 MS. MILLETT: It dealt with that. I mean, 

specifically at the legislative history level, it dealt --

it enacted that statutory exception because some States 

had made these types of business crimes punishable by more 

than a year. So that's what it was responding to. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. What -- what --

MS. MILLETT: I can't -- I --

JUSTICE SOUTER: No. I -- finish your answer.

this. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Oh, there's no --

MS. MILLETT: Right, but --

JUSTICE SOUTER: We both know there's no --

MS. MILLETT: But -- but what Congress did here 

-- and it's very important to understand -- it was 

throwing a broad net --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Millett. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: All right. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Millett, there are many 

lawyers in Congress and at least the law students of my 

generation -- some of them are of that elder age. We 

learned in law school one country doesn't enforce the 

penal judgments of another. This is a kind of enforcement 

of a penal judgment of another, not exactly, but something 

like it. Another reason why I would expect a Congress, 

knowing that background norm, would say, when it meant 

foreign, foreign. Unlike the context of the immigration, 

yes, there are some people who left and came back, but 

many -- and -- and we have all this whole line of cases. 

Is adultery a crime of moral turpitude, and you know, 

those go back to the '20's. 

But this, which came about only because of the 

merger of two statutes, one saying Federal and State, the

other not, and no explanation at all, in light of all 

these anomalies that have been brought out. Shouldn't we 

say to Congress maybe that's what you meant, but if you 

did, you have an opportunity to say so before we read in 

foreign? 

MS. MILLETT: Two answers, Justice Ginsburg. 

First, this was the second time in 1986 that Congress 

refused to include that limitation on courts. The prior 

law, before the 1968 act, specifically referred to courts 

of the United States, States, and territories. It did not 

pick up that language in title IV in 1968, and they took 

it out --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But neither did it give any 

explanation for not carrying it forward. 

MS. MILLETT: No, but I don't -- that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: It's -- it's the silence at the 

-- at the time it -- it apparently departed from the 

practice of predecessor statutes that -- that seems to be 

a problem for your argument. 

MS. MILLETT: But -- but again, I don't think 

this Court has ever characterized as silence Congress' 

twice deletion of language from a statute in 1968 and 

again in 1986. It had it. It looked at it. It took it 

out. And in 1986 in the Senate report that you were 

referring to, Justice Ginsburg, earlier, Congress said

they -- the conference report said we are rejecting the 

Senate's definition of felony.

 The other thing to keep in mind is when Congress 

enacted this statute in 1968, it also enacted an 

administrative mechanism for relief that would deal with 

exactly the uncomfortable situations that have been 

identified. 925(c) allows an administrative waiver in 

cases where an individual comes and says I don't want 

to --

JUSTICE STEVENS: You know, this is a very 

interesting case because there are three ways to answer 

the question of what is a court. You can leave it up to 

us to do it, and that would be judicial legislation to 

fill in a hole in the statute. You can have the executive 

do it, decide what case -- what cases to prosecute, or if 

we should knock out this -- interpret the statute in the 

-- in a different way than you urge, Congress would then 

do it. Now, which of the three is the better lawmaker on 

deciding which is the -- what should the meaning of the 

word court be? The executive, the legislature, or the 

judiciary?

 MS. MILLETT: I think -- it's, of course, the 

legislature and the President's signature. I'd like to 

put a plug in for the executive in -- in that reference, 

but --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That would save us a lot of 

work. We --

(Laughter.) 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- we could just invalidate 

all statutes that we don't understand. 

(Laughter.) 

MS. MILLETT: But, Justice Kennedy and Justice 

Stevens, the important thing to keep in mind here is we 

don't just have a statute that appeared out of nowhere. 

It's been on the books for a long time and there was a 

legislative --

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but it is pretty clear 

that Congress didn't really think about this problem. 

MS. MILLETT: No, but it thought -- it --

JUSTICE STEVENS: And it is also clear on your 

side that they would like to prevent this guy from having 

a gun. 

MS. MILLETT: Exactly, and --

JUSTICE STEVENS: So there are two competing 

considerations, both of which are very powerful.

 MS. MILLETT: Well, if nothing else -- and this 

guy is squarely within what Congress wanted to capture. 

If nothing else, you don't have to decide anything more in 

this case than that it covers persons like this whose 

convictions are fundamentally fair and it's not contested

JUSTICE BREYER: Can I -- I want to get you. 

Now, I have a new question. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Would -- would you finish --

would you finish please --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I have a new --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- telling us about the 

administrative waiver proceeding? You were in the middle 

of it and I never heard the --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's exactly what I wanted to 

know. 

MS. MILLETT: Right. 

JUSTICE BREYER: And I -- can I -- that's 

exactly what I wanted to know. When a person comes in to 

get a gun -- because I hadn't focused on this, and it 

actually to me it's relevant. Suppose one of these people 

has been convicted in a foreign court and he doesn't have 

a clue, you know, that this means he can't buy a gun over 

here. So he comes over here. He goes into a -- a gun 

store. Now, does he get notice that that -- this 

conviction over in Japan or Lithuania or wherever it was 

means that he can't buy the gun?

 MS. MILLETT: Well, he got -- in this case, he 

got -- and this is --

JUSTICE BREYER: No. I'm asking -- I'm asking

in general. 

MS. MILLETT: You -- you go and you fill out a 

form that says, as this case did -- and it's on page 4 of 

our brief --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes. 

MS. MILLETT: -- asked him, have you been 

convicted in any court of --

JUSTICE BREYER: So it just says any court.

 MS. MILLETT: In any court. And I think when 

someone --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well --

MS. MILLETT: No. But when someone has a 

conviction, when you have a felony conviction, you're on 

some notice of inquiry. 

JUSTICE BREYER: It'll work for -- yes. It'll 

-- it'll work for this one, but -- but what I'm worried 

about -- and really what led the Sentencing Commission to 

exclude all this stuff even though clearly recidivists 

should get a higher sentence, but we still excluded it 

because it's just a nightmare. There are notice problems. 

There are fairness problems. There are procedural 

problems. There are problems of crimes that aren't crimes 

here.

 MS. MILLETT: Justice --

JUSTICE BREYER: And -- and all those come up,

and that's what I'm worried about. So I see this as a 

possible out.

 MS. MILLETT: Well --

JUSTICE BREYER: The one -- the procedure you 

just talked about might help.

 MS. MILLETT: And it's in 925(c), which is on --

JUSTICE BREYER: That he knows about it. 

MS. MILLETT: -- page 65a of our brief. But let 

me -- let me be --

JUSTICE SCALIA: And it provides judicial review 

of the Attorney General's failure to give the waiver.

 MS. MILLETT: It does, and -- but let me be 

candid up front. Congress stopped funding this 

administrative mechanism in 1992, and that -- this Court 

addressed that in the Bean case. It -- it doesn't exist 

now, but that was 25 years after Congress wrote this 

language and put it in the statute, and the fact that they 

stopped funding it 25 years later doesn't mean the statute 

doesn't mean what it said. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know why?

 MS. MILLETT: And Congress --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Do you know why they stopped 

funding it? Why did -- because I think that's been 

reenacted every year. No money for this. Why -- why did 

Congress stop funding it?

 MS. MILLETT: Because some of -- some of the 

people who were getting waivers were going out and 

committing crimes again. Congress here is very concerned 

about public safety.

 And this is not -- there was, you know, the 

question, is there ever an element where you treat this 

like an element of foreign crime. There aren't -- there 

aren't crimes normally where you treat indictments or 

someone being under a restraining order this way. This is 

not punishing you for your foreign crime. This is a 

global categorical, class-wide judgment that as a class 

persons who have committed crimes overseas are more 

dangerous and may pose exactly the public safety risk we 

wanted to grab and stop. As a class, they do that. In a 

particular case, it may not. In a particular case, an 

indictment might not. Congress was speaking globally. It 

did so. It threw a broad net. It did so at the time it 

had an administrative check to deal with these problems. 

Yes, that's gone. That doesn't retroactively change what 

the statutory language meant. 

This Court has said time and time again that 

this statutory language in 922 was written, in Beecham and 

Huddleston, with such care that Congress was focused on 

the difference between the present perfect and the past 

tense, this Court said in Barrett. This is not sloppy

writing. When Congress put any court in and did not carry 

forward a limitation to the courts of the United States 

and took that out in another part of the statute in 1986, 

we have to assume that Congress knew what it was doing.

 If there are problems here, there is a 

political process to deal with it. The political process 

has taken away the administrative waiver. But there has 

not been -- this hypothesis of bad applications has not 

arisen. It's hypothesized. And what this statute has --

has been used to do is capture exactly the people Congress 

wanted to capture. It got exactly the ones who should be 

disarmed. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you know anybody in the 

Justice Department you might talk to to amend this form so 

that the form says this includes convictions in foreign 

countries?

 MS. MILLETT: I -- I am confident that the ATF 

would be happy to do that. As of now, the ATF has a 

regulation on the books for someone to look at and see 

that includes foreign convictions in this definition. And 

I think when someone has been convicted, they're on 

notice.

 Thank you, Justice Stevens. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Thank you. 

The case is submitted.
