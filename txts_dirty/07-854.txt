 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next this morning in Case 07-854, Van De Kamp v. 

Goldstein.

 Mr. Coates.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. COATES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 This case arises from a Ninth Circuit 

opinion that essentially creates an exception to 

absolute prosecutorial immunity for chief advocates and 

supervising advocates. The court's decision in the 

Ninth Circuit essentially held that prosecutorial 

policies that apply to an entire body of cases in a 

trial office do not qualify for absolute immunity.

 We submit that this is inconsistent with 

this Court's decision in Imbler v. Pachtman and its 

progeny, applying the functional approach to absolute 

immunity. There is essentially no distinction between a 

chief advocate or supervising prosecutor implementing a 

policy directing that cases be handled in a particular 

manner and that particular chief advocate or supervising 

advocate actually participating in the courtroom.

Because of the size of the prosecutorial 

agencies, it's not feasible that a chief advocate or 

supervisor can be in a courtroom in every single case. 

But they can put their prosecutorial stamp on each case 

through the implementation of policy, through training, 

or through other means.

 Here the policy at issue concerns compliance 

with the obligation to disclose exculpatory information 

under Brady v. Maryland and also Giglio v. United 

States.

 In Imbler versus Pachtman, the Court 

recognized that those obligations are core prosecutorial 

obligations that are part of the prosecution's intimate 

relationship to the fairness of the trial proceedings. 

And we submit that that duty, that function, is the same 

whether it's performed in the courtroom or whether it's 

performed by a chief advocate or supervising advocate in 

terms of formulating policy or when making particular 

policy decisions.

 Imbler recognized that these core decisions 

had to be insulated. Otherwise, it would spawn 

litigation that would burden the judicial process. And 

it might cause them to hesitate to produce particular 

exculpatory information. It might create a burden of 

having them involved in more lawsuits than actually

performing their function and prosecuting the criminal 

law.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Was -- was there an 

element in Imbler of the fact that you have to 

make tactical and strategic decisions at -- at the 

moment that are difficult, that call for judgment that 

has to be exercised on the spur of the moment?

 This is somewhat different. This is -- this 

is a long-term commitment or a long-term policy that the 

Respondents are arguing for. It seems to me somewhat 

different than the dynamics that inform the Imbler 

decision.

 MR. COATES: Well, the court in Imbler did 

mention a time frame in which decisions have to be made 

-- quickly made by individual prosecutors. It also 

noted the sheer number of decisions that are often made 

in the context of a criminal prosecution.

 I would say, with respect to chief advocates 

and -- and supervisors, the number of those types of 

decisions is the same. They have the same complexity in 

determining what is going to come up in every single 

case as an individual prosecutor does in a -- in a 

single case.

 Moreover, there is a multitude more that 

they have to consider because they are considering the

possibility of its impact on thousands of cases within 

the office. I will note, though, in Butz v. Economou, 

where the Court extended absolute immunity to 

individuals prosecuting agency actions, that same point 

was raised. But some of the conduct there was a bit 

more drawn-out in terms of the investigative manner --

not the investigative manner, but the -- the 

prosecutorial process used by the administrative agency. 

And the court didn't find that -- that longer time frame 

to be dispositive.

 Going back to Imbler, it again looked at 

what the basic function was in the administrative agency 

proceeding and found, yes, it is akin to prosecutorial 

conduct.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: May I ask you kind of 

perhaps a farfetched hypothetical question just so I get 

the case law in mind? Supposing a prosecutor wanted to 

develop a policy which would keep -- which would create 

a bifurcated regime within the office where the people 

who interrogate prisoners are entirely separate from the 

people who prosecute trials, so that they don't have the 

malicious purpose that your adversary says is involved 

in this case. And supposing the prosecutor then hired 

some expert layman who had no trial experience at all to 

develop such a program, and the program, itself, is

desirable from the prosecution's point of view but --

but presumably unconstitutional. Would the person who 

developed that program be entitled to immunity --

MR. COATES: The --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- in my example?

 MR. COATES: The lay person --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Yes.

 MR. COATES: The layperson, as a private 

actor, I think would not be. I think the prosecutor 

that developed the policy would be. It would be like 

delegating it to a staff member. It might depend also 

on how close the relationship is. The Court has noted 

in some of the judicial immunity cases that sometimes 

court clerks can perform functions that are essentially 

judicial functions.

 In that case, though, under the Court's 

jurisprudence with private actors, they might have only 

qualified immunity, the private actors. But the 

decision to use them would be prosecutorial.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, why -- why is it 

qualified immunity if a separate person does it, but not 

qualified immunity if precisely the same task is 

performed by somebody who happens also to be a 

prosecutor?

 MR. COATES: Because it's not so much the

physical task of doing it. It's carrying out the 

obligation of performing that particular function. The 

function is compliance with Giglio and Brady. That is 

always a prosecutorial function. Whether the data is 

kept with a police department or an investigative 

agency, the buck stops with the prosecutor.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: And in my hypothetical is 

it or is it not a prosecutorial -- does the layperson 

perform or not perform a prosecutorial function?

 MR. COATES: If he is just collating data, 

then that is -- that's -- that's a task. Our point is 

that this isn't about just collating data. It's about 

the policy that data must be collated and used. That is 

the Brady-Giglio obligation. You can't divorce the --

the information from the purpose for which, why it's 

supposed to be used.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: No, but I'm trying to 

divorce the information in the particular case from 

developing the program.

 MR. COATES: Well, I --perhaps I 

misunderstood the question. It sounds to me that the 

prosecutor has made a decision that he is going to put 

this thing in place, this process in place. That's 

their way that they satisfy or don't satisfy Giglio or 

Brady.

Maybe they don't satisfy. Maybe it's a 

terrible decision. But I think that decision ends up 

being prosecutorial in nature.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Even if it's made by a 

layman?

 MR. COATES: Setting up the program, no. 

But the -- I think the buck stops with the prosecutor as 

to whether that's a valid process or not. I mean, the 

person may adequately perform their function, or they 

may not. But the person at the end of the day who is 

responsible for it ends up being the prosecutor.

 And he may inevitably -- the person may 

inevitably perform something, but at the end of the day 

the prosecutor is the one that -- that has the task 

under Giglio and Brady of ensuring the accuracy of the 

information.

 I think that kind of underscores here the 

approach the Respondent has taken is to kind of say, 

well, this is just a collection of data here, this is 

just bookkeeping. But it's not. The core of the 

constitutional claim here is that there is an obligation 

under Brady and Giglio somehow to collect this 

information, to disseminate this information.

 And that's the obligation that we are being 

sued for, and that's the sort of thing that prosecutors

do. And you can you hire someone to do it, but somebody 

is the gatekeeper. Someone has to basically decide what 

goes in or what doesn't go in and whether it's 

sufficient or insufficient at the end of the day to 

comply with -- with Brady and Giglio. And so that can't 

be distinguished from the -- the prosecutorial role, 

whether it's conducted by a -- a chief advocate or by a 

supervising advocate.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I -- I suppose that 

is why the Petitioners seemed to change their theory. 

They -- they -- they were -- they were concerned about 

prosecutorial immunity, so they take it to the higher 

level of policy.

 When -- when they do that, I suppose they 

might have the stronger argument if they could show 

deliberate indifference. Are there cases that help them 

on the "deliberate indifference"? What's -- what's the 

best case for them on deliberate indifference?

 MR. COATES: I couldn't say what the best 

case is for them. I could not say what the best case is 

for them on -- on "deliberate indifference." We have 

not pushed on the merits part of this case. It was not 

briefed down below, and it is not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That is why the case is 

hard, and I -- I almost have to see what the violation

would be before I could determine the qualified immunity 

aspect of the case.

 MR. COATES: Well, indeed. I mean, several 

amici has raise the question of whether there is the 

constitutional violation at all, but it has not been 

raised below. And of course, under this Court's 

decision in Buckley we have to assume the existence of a 

constitutional violation.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: That's what we are 

deciding in sort of in a vacuum. It's a little 

difficult.

 MR. COATES: Precisely. But I think our 

point is that -- that if you buy their theory of a 

constitutional claim, whatever constitutional claim that 

is is a -- a prosecutorial function-related claim, 

because that's the nature of the Giglio and Brady 

obligation. They are trial obligations. They don't 

have any meaning outside the context of an actual 

prosecution.

 And so, again we submit that there is really 

no difference to the chief advocate or supervising 

advocate formulating this particular policy for all the 

cases in the office -- this is what we do -- then there 

is the individual actions of a particular trial attorney 

in a given case or even if it were possible for a

supervising attorney or chief advocate to participate in 

everything. They could accomplish the same thing, I 

suppose, by every time a case is filed sending out an 

e-mail saying: Comply with our policies.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: The Monell case -- does 

the Monell case rest on the assumption that there can be 

instances where a policy makes the policy of those who 

adopted the policy liable?

 MR. COATES: I think that's right. Reading 

the Monell allegations of the complaint against the 

County of Los Angeles, I think that that is what it is, 

that the deputy -- that the district attorney rather, 

acts as a county officer and would be the policymaker 

for those policies and customs and practices.

 That obviously is not at issue here. 

Petitioners are being sued as individuals for their acts 

as supervisors and as the chief advocate in formulating 

a particular policy concerning compliance with Brady and 

Giglio.

 These sort of cases, opening this door 

particularly for the broad claim that plaintiffs are now 

trying to assert, which is this kind of notion of 

information management, can spawn all sorts of claims. 

Virtually any time that you can't reach the individual 

trial attorney, all you need do is attribute whatever

you think that person did to the failure to develop a 

policy or provide training or to have adequate data 

management to allow them to do the job.

 This kind of end-run under Imbler will 

create the multitude of litigation and drag chief 

advocates in, as well as supervising advocates, that 

Imbler was designed to avoid. And it has the worse 

collateral effect that it's also going to end up pulling 

in the individual attorneys, the individual trial 

attorneys in a given case, because maybe they don't have 

individual liability, but they are certainly going to 

come in; they are going to testify as witnesses.

 So, it's the worst of both worlds, which is 

you are burdening the chief advocate with this sort of 

litigation which may impact the way they formulate 

policy, and you are burdening the individual line deputy 

attorney, and that's the attorney that Imbler sought to 

protect as well.

 Those adverse consequences on the judicial 

process are what led this Court in Imbler to recognize 

the importance of absolute immunity for prosecutors. We 

submit that it's even more important that that immunity 

be logically applied to chief advocates and to 

supervisors. Otherwise, I think Imbler will be 

eviscerated and we will have the very evils that Imbler

 If the Court has no further questions, I 

will reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 MR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court:

 This Court recognized absolute prosecutorial 

immunity for line prosecutors who are charged with 

violating an obligation that falls uniquely on 

prosecutors, namely the obligation to disclose 

exculpatory evidence. The Respondents in this case are 

seeking to circumvent that absolute prosecutorial 

immunity by reformulating the claim as one against 

supervisors who allegedly failed to fulfill duties under 

the Constitution to collect information that would 

enable the line prosecutors to comply with the core duty 

under Giglio and Brady.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Is there such a

constitutional obligation?

 MR. DREEBEN: Not in our view, 

Mr. Chief Justice. In our view the Brady obligation is 

one that falls on the Government. Giglio is an 

extension of Brady with respect to impeachment 

information. It's designed to ensure the fairness of 

the trial. It is violated only when the Government has 

suppressed material exculpatory evidence, that is, 

evidence that can undermine the fairness of the trial.

 It's intimately linked in a way that really 

nothing else in the adversary system is to preserving 

the fairness of the trial. It's an obligation on the 

prosecutor to go beyond the normal role of an advocate 

to zealously advocate for his cause, and it puts the 

advocate in the position of supplying the judicial 

system with information needed to be submitted in order 

to have a fair proceeding.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I think you have the 

flip side of the same problem your friend has. In other 

words, the further it is removed from the constitutional 

violation or an allegation of a constitutional 

violation, the less need there is for immunity. The 

closer it is or the closer we must assume it is to a 

constitutional violation, then the immunity argument is 

stronger.

MR. DREEBEN: Well, it certainly is true 

that if there were a constitutional obligation under 

Giglio and Brady, it would be one that is intimately 

tied to the judicial process, and it should receive 

absolute prosecutorial immunity.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: In the broad ethical 

scheme of things, apart from liability under this 

statute, it seems to me that a newly elected district 

attorney would take seriously the obligation to make 

sure that everybody was following Brady.

 MR. DREEBEN: Absolutely, Justice Kennedy, 

and I think that a formulation of policies to achieve 

that, whether or not required by the Constitution, is 

something that relates directly and intimately to the 

prosecutor's duties to assure --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, that's the next 

point. If I were a prosecutor, I would say: This is my 

constitutional duty to say it, in the broad sense of --

of my ethical obligations of my duties to the public.

 MR. DREEBEN: Only in the sense, I think, 

that -- that a supervisor who has the power to cause or 

prevent constitutional violations may be under some 

obligation not to cause constitutional violations. But 

the claim here is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I think it's more

than that. He can't be indifferent to sloppy practices 

in the office --

MR. DREEBEN: You certainly should not.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- consistent with his or 

her obligations to perform their duties.

 MR. DREEBEN: But I think that the 

deliberated indifference question that you raise, 

Justice Kennedy, is really a direct counterpart of the 

absolute immunity argument that we are making here. We 

are making here the argument that supervisory 

prosecutors should not be subject to suit based on broad 

policies that they have adopted that will directly have 

impact on individual cases in the way that Brady and 

Giglio obligations are fulfilled.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Mr. Dreeben, what do you 

do with my hypothetical? Do you remember it?

 MR. DREEBEN: I remember it, 

Justice Stevens, and I think that the -- I agree with 

Mr. Coates on this one. The supervisory prosecutor who 

formulates the policy is the only one who has the unique 

JUSTICE STEVENS: No, I'm -- my hypothetical 

is they hire a layman --

MR. DREEBEN: Yes.

that will keep separate from prosecutors information 

about the way witnesses are developed. And the policy I 

think is highly unprobable, I agree with you, but the 

policy is designed to avoid the obligation imposed by 

Giglio and Brady.

 MR. DREEBEN: That's the allegation, of 

course. And the first thing that I want to say is that 

if you allow suits based on allegations that you think 

are really bad, you open the door to allegations that 

will have to be sorted out throughout the judicial 

system.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: But that's true even 

without -- without an immunity.

 MR. DREEBEN: But I think that the point is 

that the immunity prevents the prosecutors from having 

to fear that they will be subject to those kind of 

suits.

 But to answer your question directly, the 

layperson, if he causes a constitutional violation, 

isn't shielded by the constitutional -- excuse me -- by 

the prosecutorial immunity that attaches only to 

prosecutors. And that's because if you go back to the 

roots in Imbler, what you see is that prosecutorial 

immunity is really --

question is, if that's true, and if there is -- you can 

compartmentalize the prosecutor's work in the office and 

he develops a separate chapter of his own duty to just 

do that performance, why is that trial-related?

 MR. DREEBEN: I think the flaw in 

Respondent's theory is the attempt to bifurcate what the 

prosecutor is doing into an administrative function and 

a prosecutorial function.  And that's the same, I think, 

maneuver in your hypothetical, to say that the 

prosecutor is really doing something administrative and 

Imbler said administrative things are non-prosecutorial; 

therefore, we can sue him.

 I think the problem with that is illustrated 

by a hypothetical about judicial immunity. Suppose --

judges of course have immunity from sitting on cases, 

and if a judge sat on a case that involved a conflict of 

interest he could not be sued or she could not be sued 

for having done so, even if it violated the 

Constitution. Suppose that the litigant reformulated 

the suit and said: Well, the judge should have had a 

policy to ensure a check of conflicts in all the cases 

that the judge sat on. And that would have been an 

administrative duty, set up some notebook that has all 

the judge's investments and direct some underling to 

ensure that no party in any case has an interest where

the judge has an investment. That was purely 

administrative, so we ought to be able to sue. The 

judge for that. And I think that obviously should fail. 

It would end-run all of the policy reasons for being 

able to assert absolute judicial immunity; and I think 

that that is identical in form to what the Respondents 

are trying to do here. They are trying to divorce the 

role of the office in maintaining some sort of a system 

to ensure that information is available to prosecutors 

to disclose under Giglio from the obligation under 

Giglio to ensure the fairness of the judicial process, 

which is an obligation that falls uniquely on the 

prosecutor and which Imbler makes clear is subject to 

absolute immunity.

 And you just can't do that. If you do that, 

you end up exposing the supervisory prosecutors to evils 

that cannot occur to the line prosecutor himself. And 

it produces anomalies. The line prosecutor, even if he 

intentionally violates Giglio, cannot be sued, but under 

Respondent's theory the supervisory prosecutor, even if 

what he did is no more than deliberately indifferent or 

perhaps even negligent, could be sued.

 The line prosecutor who handles a certain 

number of cases cannot be sued, in part because it would 

ensure a distraction of the duties of the prosecutor and

would divert him from performing his role of enforcing 

the criminal law. The supervisor, who is responsible 

for far more cases and is subject to far more 

disappointed litigants who would like to sue him, that 

person can be sued. And it would have an even more 

disruptive effect on an office if supervisory 

prosecutors, who have the responsibility, as 

Justice Kennedy pointed out, of trying to come up with 

policies that will prevent constitutional violations, 

and that will ensure that the office functions in an 

efficient and an effective manner, they will be the ones 

who are most deterred -- most deterred from acting, 

because they will suffer the possibility of thinking of 

their own individual liability rather than focusing on 

what they are supposed to do, the public interest, both 

disclosing information that needs to be disclosed, 

bringing suits that need to be brought, and using 

witnesses regardless of fears that someone later on is 

going to discover information that should have been 

disclosed and sue the supervisor, saying, "We know we 

can't sue the individual prosecutor, but you, 

supervisor, failed to develop effective policies to get 

that information to the court." That kind of 

circumvention of Imbler plays no role of fulfilling the 

policies that absolute prosecutorial immunity is

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court:

 This case is not about whether a chief D.A. 

can set policies about trial strategy. We could 

stipulate that this chief D.A. would be immune from 

those sorts of suits and it would not affect our case at 

all.

 This case is about the function of deciding 

on an officewide basis whether to track important 

historical facts and disseminate them internally within 

an office to employees who need to know those facts. 

This case is about gathering and preserving information, 

certain categories of raw data, that may or may not ever 

get into the courtroom, not about how to use those 

specific pieces of data once you actually have a 

prosecution materializing.

 This claim is no different from a claim 

against a chief of police, for example, for

systematically destroying 911 tapes, thereby depriving 

defendants of exculpatory information.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: This is creating -- this 

is creating a database. And what was the year of this 

prosecution?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: The prosecution, Your 

Honor, was in 1979, it began. That was the crime; the 

prosecution was in '80.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And back in 1979 we did 

not have the information-gathering electronic capability 

that we now have. So what are we talking about? What 

kind of database? How would it operate? Would you --

MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, so that's 

getting to the merits of the actual claim. It could be 

as simple as a file cabinet or 3 by 5 cards on which you 

list the name of the informant and his prior record of 

collaboration.

 In the U.S. Attorney's offices that do this, 

completely apart from this enormous FBI database, they 

do it very simply, the ones that I know about. They 

appoint a Giglio czar in each bureau and they say that 

when there is contact with the prosecutor's office and 

an informant, you make sure you tell this person, "send 

an e-mail," and he keeps it all in a file.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that goes 

to the merits, doesn't it? I mean, if -- I -- you could 

develop and make the same point, saying U.S. attorneys 

are instructed in complying with Giglio and Brady in 

this way. But if there is a decision not to -- I mean, 

immunity is only necessary when you assume some -- there 

has been some violation. And so the fact that somebody 

else avoids a violation, it seems to me, is not a good 

argument to deprive other people of immunity.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, this 

Court has said as clearly as it can possibly say that 

the location of the injury is irrelevant. I am quoting 

now from Buckley. In Kalina, the prosecutor executed 

the challenged certification probably the morning before 

the morning she walked into court, and it was held to be 

not immune because that was not the function of a 

prosecutor. She - with the charging document.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You drew a 

distinction earlier on between a determination by a 

prosecutor not to turn over certain material, which is 

absolutely immune, and said this was different. But 

what if the purpose of the policy is to not provide 

prosecutors with material so they can't turn it over? 

Why doesn't that go into the same prosecutorial core 

function?

MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, the 

answer is quite simple. That is the alleged motive in 

this case, in fact. It was intentional or with 

deliberate indifference, so the allegation is, the 

intention was to cut the flow of information to the line 

prosecutor. And the reason that's different is because 

while Petitioners say compliance with Brady, our answer 

is compliance with Brady comprises at least two 

functions.

 There is the front line function of the 

prosecutor, the advocate, making the decision, "Do I 

turn this information over to the defense?" This case 

has nothing to do with that front line function. This 

case has to do with the back room function. The 

function of --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why isn't that the 

same as the determination by the supervisor that, don't 

turn this information over. Here's all -- we are not 

going to share informant information because we don't 

think that should be turned over to comply with Giglio. 

The individual prosecutor they have says I'm not going 

to turn it over. Why isn't it exactly the same?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, if the 

decree comes from on high, "we don't turn over Giglio 

information here," which has actually happened in some

cases, that would be a different case, because that is 

the chief administrator directing trial tactics.

 Here it's the chief administrator looking 

entirely inward and saying, like any administrator in 

any major agency or business does, how do we get 

information from the people who know it to the people 

who need it at the front line?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: That is certainly -- you 

know, that's an interesting theory, but it's certainly 

not the theory on which the decision below was based. 

The decision below says "Neither" -- speaking of Imbler 

and prior cases -- "Neither the Supreme Court nor this 

Court has considered whether claims regarding failure to 

train, failure to supervise or failure to develop an 

officewide policy regarding a Constitutional obligation 

like the one set forth in Giglio are subject to absolute 

immunity."

 And I could quote portions of the opinion 

they are.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That's what --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They are talking about 

supervising prosecutors. They are talking about 

training prosecutors and having an officewide policy 

regarding what you do with -- with Giglio information.

read from was the broad passage that the court was 

referring to when it said this sets up a bunch of hard 

questions. This case becomes an easy case, the court 

said, because we were not dealing with the prosecutor, 

the chief D.A. setting trial tactics for the line 

prosecutors; we are dealing -- the court says this on 

page 5 of the petition -- excuse me, the petition 

appendix.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Page 5?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Page 5 of the petition 

appendix at the top. It lays out the theories. Number 

one theory is exactly the theory we are presenting here. 

At the very top line, "They violated his constitutional 

rights by purposely or with deliberate indifference 

failing to create a system that would satisfy the Giglio 

obligation."

 JUSTICE SCALIA: They are not talking about 

just collecting information.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor --

JUSTICE SCALIA: They are talking about, as 

they clarify later on, a -- a system in which they train 

and supervise and develop an officewide policy regarding 

the Giglio obligations.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, no, they -- the 

court was very clear that it was talking about

supervising and training, about the internal function of 

circulation of information within the D.A.'s office. 

Not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Let's assume that's --

that's what they did mean. I have to say I read it as 

broadly as Justice Scalia did, but let's -- let's narrow 

down the -- the Court's opinion to -- to -- to the claim 

that you are making right now.

 Let me go back to the Chief Justice's 

hypothetical and add one minor detail.

 Let's assume that in a given department they 

put into effect exactly the policy that you want. They 

have a fine system of -- of data collection, far more 

sophisticated than three by five cards, and the -- the 

boss D.A. says everybody in this office ought to know 

what kind of deals are being made and offered at all 

times. And they have such a system.

 And the boss D.A. also says and don't you 

disclose one word of it ever in any case. We are going 

to defy Giglio.

 If he made that or gave that order so that 

in every case there would be a defiance of Giglio, even 

though the facts were known, would he have absolute 

immunity?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And he's directing that

order to trial lawyers?

 JUSTICE SOUTER: That's right.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor. The 

answer is I don't know. I could imagine a theory, a 

very strong one --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, you know if in a 

given case, if they had this system, and the lawyer 

comes to him and says, okay, I've consulted our system 

and I realize we that have got a Giglio obligation. And 

the boss D.A. says: Forget it. Don't tell him a word.

 There would be absolute immunity, wouldn't 

there?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: There absolutely would, 

Your Honor.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: And my point is --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Why would the -- why would 

the answer be any different if he says don't bother me 

with particular cases? I am telling you right now what 

the answer is going to be in every case in which we have 

a Giglio obligation and that is, bury it.

 Presumably there would be absolute immunity, 

wouldn't there?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, I can imagine 

an argument on either side. I can imagine the Plaintiff

making the argument --

JUSTICE SOUTER: What's your answer?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I don't have an answer to 

that hypothetical because it's so different from our 

case.

 JUSTICE SOUTER: The trouble is if you don't 

have an answer to that hypothetical, then we got to 

leave open the possibilities as far as your case is 

concerned that he would have absolute immunity in that 

case. And if he would have absolute immunity in that 

case, then the -- the -- the reason for allowing 

anything less than absolute immunity with respect to 

this data collection obligation reduces down to 

something like an almost a silly point.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: If --

JUSTICE SOUTER: If you can get everything 

you want, and all the prosecutor has got to say is: 

Keep it under your hat and there is going to be absolute 

immunity and nobody gets anything. What is -- what is 

to be gained by that?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, that may 

well be a consequence of Imbler. But when Imbler talks 

about the function, Imbler is very clear that there is a 

distinction between trial tactics and strategy on the 

one hand in the cases under Imbler, and the sort of

backroom functions about the flow of information on the 

other --

JUSTICE SOUTER: But if the backroom 

function is reduced to an absolute nullity by an 

immunized decision to -- to bury the Giglio information 

in every case, then I don't see the point of saying 

there's no immunity for the supposed backroom function, 

because nothing will be accomplished even if there is no 

absolute immunity.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Sure, Your Honor. We 

can -- if we imagine a corrupt district attorney who 

wants to make sure that constitutional rights are 

violated and evades the edict of this Court, sure, that 

is the consequence of Imbler.

 But my point in -- in not answering the 

question about the theory under that case, is that the 

argument of the plaintiff in that case is so different 

from the argument that we are making here. The 

plaintiff in that case would be arguing, well, it is 

removed in time from the -- the actual prosecution which 

is an argument that we, too, can make. The conduct was 

before the initiation of criminal proceedings. It's 

not -- you know, you could not say it's not unique to 

prosecutors.

 Here, our argument is that there is nothing

unique to prosecutors or to lawyers about the 

information management function, about the function of 

tracking information. And by the way, this is not an 

exotic theory. This is exactly the line that this Court 

has been following in distinguishing between --

JUSTICE ALITO: Can't you say anything about 

training subordinates in any office. There is nothing 

unique about training or not training subordinates in a 

prosecutor's office as opposed to any other government 

office or, I would suppose, an office in the private 

sector. So does your argument extend to any failure to 

provided adequate training or any instance where there 

is a deliberate indifference as to the training that is 

provided?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I can see the plaintiff in 

a case using our argument to advance that point. But my 

point here is we don't even need to get to that argument 

because --

JUSTICE ALITO: So a plaintiff could say 

that it could sue a -- a district attorney for failing 

to have adequate training as to subordinates before 

you -- they are sent in to deliver a summation so that 

they know they are not supposed to comment on the 

failure of a defendant to take the stand --

JUSTICE ALITO: They are not supposed to 

vouch for witnesses, that would be a viable theory in 

your opinion?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I -- I believe that there 

is an argument. It's not the argument that I am making. 

The argument that I am making it matters what the D.A. 

is training on. If the D.A. is training on trial 

tactics, that's one thing. But here the D.A. is 

training on how to use a database, and he's not training 

the lawyers who are going to be using it.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Rosenkranz, you have, 

it seems to me, a theory of this case that is not the 

theory that the Ninth Circuit went on. I mean, the 

Ninth Circuit talks about training and supervising 

deputy district attorneys. And why do we train them? 

Because we want to ensure that they share information.

 Now you are cutting out the training and 

supervision, and you are saying the obligation of the 

supervising attorney is to have this information bank, 

which the deputy attorneys can then -- then consult, 

which, may be a very sound policy. But is it an element 

of due process that the supervising attorney has to 

devise a system to share information? Where is there 

anything -- anything that the Court has held that 

suggests that there is a data collection function

required by due process?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: So, Your Honor, let me 

ask -- let me answer the first half first, which is 

about what the Ninth Circuit held. And first, I should 

say what it is that we argued to the Ninth Circuit.

 It's on -- it's in our brief, very clearly 

we've presented on page -- excuse me -- on page 17 of 

our brief, that big paragraph, the only full paragraph, 

we present both what we argued to the Ninth Circuit, 

which was about the creation of a database, and what 

Petitioners argued to the Ninth Circuit, which reflected 

exactly what we were saying. So petitioners were not 

confused. They attributed to us the argument that they, 

quote, failed to set up a system to disseminate to 

deputy district attorneys information about plea deals 

and other assistance being offered to informants.

 That was -- and that was directly out of our 

brief. That was the first line of their brief, and the 

first line of our brief also referred to that.

 I agree, the Ninth Circuit spoke more about 

training than about this information database. But the 

Ninth Circuit was also speaking only about --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And there is nothing in 

the Ninth Circuit -- there was nothing that was 

presented to the Ninth Circuit by Mr. Goldstein that had

to do with this talk about training?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: There was, Your Honor. In 

our complaint we had two what might be called 

information management theories.

 One -- and you can see it on page 45 of our 

complaint of the joint appendix, and so while the Court 

is orienting itself -- there were -- there's a theory of 

information management that is the most prominent theory 

in the complaint. If you look at the bottom of page 45, 

about seven lines up from the bottom, you see two 

distinct kind of subtheories.

 The first is -- so it starts -- the line 

starts purposely or with a deliberate indifference --

theory 1-A, that petitioners failed to create any system 

for the deputy district attorneys handling criminal 

cases to access information, about informants, of 

course.

 Theory B, two lines from the bottom, "that 

they failed to train deputy district attorneys to 

disseminate information pertaining to the benefits 

provided to jailhouse informants." That's also about 

disseminating it internally. If one turns to page 69, 

the specific allegations against Petitioners, you see 

paragraph 154, repeatedly talking about this information 

system, this information sharing system, both as a

system to create and as a failure to train. But, again, 

train on what? Train on the need, when you don't have 

the system, to inform the other guy that you've just 

made a deal with the informant.

 JUSTICE BREYER: But I would like to follow 

that up a bit by saying, one, I'm not sure what this 

difference between what you are arguing now and what you 

are arguing then matters. I don't understand it, 

frankly. I don't actually understand it, because I 

agree, when you were in the Ninth Circuit, with what you 

said: It's a failure to disseminate information. And 

then you said: And it's a failure to train and 

supervise. You did say that. Now, why that matters, I 

don't know, because the problem that -- maybe it does 

matter, maybe it doesn't. So I have to say I don't 

understand it. Now, help my understanding.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: I don't think it does 

matter.

 JUSTICE BREYER: All right. I know you 

don't, but I'm not worried about that. I'm worried 

about my understanding of your argument, and that's what 

I am trying to get to. Answer this question, please, 

because it will help me: The obvious response is the 

response the Government made. You can take any -- which 

is what Justice Alito said. So I would just like to you

elaborate on it. You can take anything that the D.A. 

does that is wrong in the case, you know, some horrible 

thing he did. And maybe he shouldn't be immune, but he 

is, okay? Or maybe he should be. There we are.

 So, here I know I can't bring this suit, but 

here's what I claim: You failed to have a system that 

did... and now we fill in the blank. And whatever that 

blank is, it's going to be something that would have 

stopped him from doing this bad thing. In your case, it 

happens to be an information dissemination system. In 

other case, it would be some other kind of system that 

would have the effect of stopping this bad thing. So, 

their point is that, if you can go ahead with yours, so 

can anybody else go ahead with theirs, and that is the 

end of immunity. Okay?

 Now, what is your response? That's what I 

want to know.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, my response to 

that is very simple: I don't know of any other trial 

right -- prosecutorial misconduct, that can be 

controlled -- excuse me, where you can evade immunity 

under our theory the way you can with a theory that is 

based on the management --

JUSTICE BREYER: Sure, it's easy. What the 

prosecutor does is he makes the most horrendous

prejudicial argument you'd ever see. So we say: What 

you need in the D.A.'s office, since this happens all 

the time, are classes, or what you need is a special 

section of the library where they have horrible 

arguments underlined, okay?

 (Laughter.)

 JUSTICE BREYER: And so, I can do that. So 

can you. You are very good at it. And any good lawyer 

can do that. And that's their point. So, if your only 

response, that's your response, your point is that a 

good lawyer, while he can do yours, couldn't do others, 

I understand the response. I'm not sure I agree with 

it.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, and I was 

beginning to say before that there is nothing at all 

exotic about the theory. The same lines are being drawn 

by this Court all the time. For example, in Kalina, a 

very fine line between the prosecutor who is creating 

charging documents on the one hand, writing them, 

submitting them to the Court, and then on the other 

hand, signing them. Or, in the investigative cases, the 

line between the process of gathering information, the 

raw data, on the one hand; and on the other hand, the 

assessment of that data for trial.

 And so, when you are talking about a

prosecutor and trying to hold the district attorney 

vicariously liable for decisions of a trial lawyer, that 

is just very different from trying to hold the district 

attorney liable for the process of managing data, raw 

information, that may or may not ever make its way into 

a courtroom.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Your theory applies to any 

system of data dissemination. Is that -- would that be 

correct?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Any one that is 

constitutionally based, Your Honor. I mean, one where 

you could imagine a prosecution on the other end with a 

constitutional right that is violated.

 JUSTICE ALITO: If the prosecutor has the 

policy of failing to distribute to the line attorneys 

the latest Ninth Circuit decision or the latest 

decisions of this Court on important issues of criminal 

constitutional procedure, because they just don't like 

the way the law is developing in these areas. So they 

like the law the way it existed at sometime in the past, 

and they are just not going to distribute any of that. 

Would that be a theory?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, you have to imagine a 

world in which the district attorney is depriving people 

of the tools of their trade so that they can't get it

elsewhere. There is actually a real case that I -- that 

I've heard about where, you know, the district attorney 

decided way back when to stop buying supplements for 

statutory -- for statute books, and so district 

attorneys, line prosecutors were charging under the 

wrong statutes.

 That, to me Your Honor, is a commissary 

function. It is a function of an administrator trying 

-- making decisions about how to arm the trial lawyer.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Can I ask you this 

question? I know we have an immunity case, but your 

underlying cause of action, the one you just described, 

the policy there of not filing supplements, or say you 

had a policy of training lawyers how to evade the Batson 

issue. There are all sorts of troublesome policies that 

might be developed. Are you aware of any case in which 

the court has held that such a policy can be challenged 

in the abstract, in the -- as, sort of, on its face, 

rather than as applied?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: You are asking whether the 

policy --

JUSTICE STEVENS: The policy when they --

when they deny someone his Giglio rights or so on and so 

on. Have you had any cases like this one in which a 

court has held that such a cause of action is available

against an office policy?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: That such a cause of 

action --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Can be brought under 1983 

for such a general policy?

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: In the absence of a 

constitutional injury?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: That it will produce on a 

regular basis constitutional --

MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, I am aware 

of any such case, but I will say --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Then it seems to me that 

in this case the absolute immunity question is harder 

than the question that you present on the merits.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Your Honor, it's actually 

not, and I will tell you why. Our -- we do not have to 

allege, for a 1983 case, that the conduct complained of 

was unconstitutional. All we have to allege was that 

the conduct caused a constitutional violation. So, for 

1983 purposes, this case is a case -- most clearly, most 

prominently our theory would be that this case is a case 

in which the district attorney was aware of this market 

bazaar atmosphere of trading in illegal -- excuse me --

in perjured jailhouse confessions and did nothing to 

intervene. It's sort of a classic Hanton claim.

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the bottom line would 

be, if you are right, that every district attorney in 

the country, large or small office, would have to have a 

data bank that can be shared by all prosecutors, 

informants that are used. That would be the 

constitutional requirement for every supervising 

prosecutor in the land.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Not necessarily, Your 

Honor. First of all, Giglio imposes the -- or puts the 

district attorneys on notice as to what they ought to be 

doing. But the constitutional requirement would be when 

you were aware of strong warnings of this bizarre 

atmosphere in which jailhouse confessions are being used 

in this way, and you are aware that lawyers on one side 

of the office don't know what lawyers on the other side 

of the office are doing, then, yes, you are deliberately 

indifferent to the constitutional violations.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I was surprised by 

your answer to Justice Stevens's hypothetical, because I 

thought it undermines your case. You said that you 

don't have to show that the data system is 

unconstitutional. You just have to show that it caused 

a constitutional violation. But it would cause a 

constitutional violation as applied in a particular 

case. And you would object to it in that case, and

perhaps all this data sharing information system would 

be very good evidence in that case. Look, he didn't 

turn over this document. The reason he didn't turn it 

over is because they've got a policy of not giving them 

the document. But your objection would have to be based 

in a particular case. And we have already held that in 

that case there is absolute immunity.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, and that 

is true of almost every prosecutorial immunity case. 

The injury almost always happens when the lapse 

materializes in injury in the courtroom.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Exactly. Now, 

doesn't that just confirm the concern that has been 

expressed that all you're doing is circumventing the 

absolute immunity we recognized at trial.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, Your Honor, not any 

more --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Even though the data 

system, as you've said, doesn't cause a constitutional 

violation. It's the application of it at trial. Now, I 

know that's immune. You say, well, I'm going to get 

around it.

Honor, than Buckley or Burns were circumnavigating

constitutional violations -- excuse me -- the acts that 

were being challenged were fabricating evidence. Why? 

The only purpose for fabricating the evidence was to 

produce it in the courtroom. Giving legal advice to 

extract a confession in a particular way. Why? The 

only purpose was to use that in the courtroom.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But you began this 

dialogue by suggesting that you don't -- I am saying --

you don't have to prove that what you are complaining 

about causes a -- is a constitutional violation. You 

just have to prove that it causes a Constitutional 

violation.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Right, Your Honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: In all the examples 

you just gave me, it seems to me the allegation would be 

that --

MR. ROSENKRANZ: No, not -- under Cedank, 

Your Honor, it was not -- it would not be a 

constitutional violation to extract a confession from 

someone until that confession is used in the courtroom.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but that gets 

-- it seems to me a fundamental tension in your case. 

When you are talking about the conduct, you need to link 

it to a particular constitutional violation. The data 

system has to be linked. But when you are talking about

immunity, you want to say, oh, it has got nothing to do 

with the constitutional violation. It's just shuffling 

paper.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, Your Honor, that's 

exactly right. It is because the functional approach --

for purposes of a functional approach, you never look at 

the case through the lens of a constitutional violation. 

You look at it through the lens of the conduct that's 

being challenged. So that's what, for example, this 

Court did in Kalina. The constitutional violation 

occurred in the courtroom, but the lens that the Court 

looked at it through was the specific conduct where this 

Court said --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But your client's standing 

to challenge this whole policy is the fact that he was 

the victim of the -- of the use of the policy in a 

particular case for which the prosecutor has 

absolute immunity.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Yes, Your Honor, and that 

is always true in an immunity case. It is always true 

that the -- that the injury materializes in the 

courtroom. And this Court said in Buckley and in Burns 

it is utterly irrelevant where the injury materializes. 

What is relevant is whether you have a --

earlier that there are no prior cases in which such -- a 

person who suffered such an injury can bring an 

independent 1983 case challenging the policy at large.

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: Well, that's correct, Your 

Honor, but it's a rare event that gets discovered.

 Thank you, Your Honor.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 MR. COATES: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 I think some of the Court's comments have 

underscored the tension in this case that the nature of 

the constitutional claim here: That the rights that 

were actually violated are the Giglio and Brady rights. 

But the function we are talking about is the function of 

complying with Brady and Giglio.

 You can do it in various fashions. Maybe 

it's a data base. Maybe it's something else. Maybe in 

some cases it's even foreclosing particular witnesses 

from testifying because you don't trust them. That is 

essentially what the district attorney's policy is now. 

It -- it forecloses deputy district attorneys from just, 

willy-nilly, using jailhouse informants. They have

severe restrictions on what they can do.

 It's hard to imagine a -- a policy that is 

more directed to courtroom behavior than something 

that's caveating the discretion of a particular line 

prosecutor as to which witnesses they can use.

 I think what we have here is a 

constitutional claim that the tighter they try and draw 

not just the causation, but the nature of the obligation 

itself is tied to the prosecutorial function. Because 

it's part of the prosecutorial function to assure the 

disclosure of exculpatory information under Brady and --

and Giglio.

 And so I would submit that under Imbler this 

Court has already held that that conduct by an 

individual prosecutor falls squarely within immunity. 

And I submit that there is -- there is simply no 

distinction for that kind of conduct when it's done in 

the courtroom and that kind of conduct when it's done in 

advance in all cases by a supervising prosecutor or by a 

chief advocate. If the Court has no further questions 

JUSTICE BREYER: I suppose the distinction 

he's trying to make maybe -- I'm not sure I've got it 

right, but you see there are certain kinds of systems 

that maybe administratively an office ought to have.

And where it turns out that this is really an 

administrative system, a lot of offices do have it, some 

don't, but where it was negligent not to have it and the 

very presence of it would have prevented the -- the 

individual in the courtroom from behaving the way he 

did, well, that's a separate kind of a claim. That's an 

administrative claim.

 Just as if, for example, suppose you had no 

secretary or assistants. He says, look, everybody 

should have secretarial assistance. And if only you had 

secretarial assistance, these people would not have 

misread everything the way they did or would have gotten 

the phone calls or would have done something like that. 

That's the kind of line -- so he's trying to draw a line 

there between something that is pretty purely 

administrative and -- and something that is really 

supervisory and training. And he is not saying 

supervisory and training. He is saying that was a 

separate claim.

 MR. COATES: Well, I think it's hard for him 

to get away from the manner in which he is trying to 

characterize it as being just administrative because 

it's not information just sitting there in a vacuum. 

The key thing is the policy that --

or he wants to say in that day's world, whatever it was. 

They have information systems. They existed, and every 

office ought to have them. And now he says I might lose 

on that claim; but, nonetheless, it's not the kind of 

claim that falls within Imbler. I think that's his 

point. I'm not positive. He doesn't have to take my --

MR. COATES: I think that is -- that is the 

point. But I think our point is that trying to 

characterize that as an administrative system strips it 

of the -- the meaning for which you are collecting the 

data. I mean, according to them, the reason we have the 

obligation is because of the prosecutorial obligation 

under Giglio and Brady to make sure that exculpatory 

information gets out there. So it's -- it's not just 

administrative.

 And I -- I assume if you look at the Ninth 

Circuit decision -- and I -- and one of the main focuses 

of the Ninth Circuit's decision in the case was not so 

much that it was merely administerial. It kind of 

reached that conclusion on this notion that decisions 

about all cases are different than decisions about a 

particular case.

 And I think our point is that, in looking at 

the -- at the function performed here, you can't make 

that distinction. That it really -- there really isn't

a distinction.  That if you are making a decision for 

all cases, then you are making a decision for that 

particular case.

 There is no difference from making a policy 

in advance and saying everybody has to follow it. And 

then, as I mentioned before, the criminal complaint is 

filed, and you send out an e-mail saying comply with 

Brady, or this is how you comply with Brady. There is 

no real difference there.
