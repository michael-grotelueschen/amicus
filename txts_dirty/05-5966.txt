[11:02 a.m.] 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We'll hear argument 

next in Clark versus Arizona. 

Mr. Goldberg. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. GOLDBERG 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. GOLDBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

Eric Michael Clark was denied his Fourteenth 

Amendment right to a fair trial. Arizona law defined 

the cognitive elements of first-degree murder as 

requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Eric 

Clark intentionally and knowingly shot and killed a 

police officer in the line of duty. The State of 

Arizona was permitted to offer facts to 

circumstantially prove these mental and essential 

requisite elements of mens rea. Under the rule 

espoused by the Arizona Supreme Court in State versus 

Mott, as we have been calling it, "the Mott rule," this 

evidence, as offered by the defense both in lay 

testimony and expert testimony, was arbitrarily 

categorically excluded as a rule of evidence that's 

unsupported by any valid State purpose. 

In this case --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: It was excluded with 

respect to mens rea, but, of course, all of the 

evidence came in with respect to the insanity defense. 

MR. GOLDBERG: It came in, yes, Mr. Chief 

Justice, as to the insanity defense, but could only be 

considered if Eric knew right from wrong. It cannot be 

considered because of the peculiar adoption of an 

amendment to 13-502, which is the Arizona insanity 

statute, that eliminated consideration of the nature 

and quality of his acts. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- the State telling us --

and we'll ask the State when they argue -- but is the 

State telling us that it has defined "intent" in a 

particular way for this, so that "intent" is just 

having the purpose to cause the result --

MR. GOLDBERG: If they were --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- and, therefore, that 

this testimony is irrelevant? Is that the State's 

argument, as you understand it? 

MR. GOLDBERG: As I understand the State's 

argument, they are adopting what Justice Ginsburg wrote 

in Montana v. Egelhoff, that the State, by enacting 

this rule, has made this a substantive choice to make

evidence of mental illness irrelevant. However, 

Arizona did not do that, and Arizona did not argue 

that below. Below, Arizona argued, repeatedly, that 

Eric Clark knew this was a police officer, that Eric 

Clark intentionally shot a police officer. On appeal, 

they argued the same thing. In the appellate decision 

in this case, by the Court of Appeals of the State of 

Arizona, the State -- I raised a challenge to the 

sufficiency of the evidence in addressing that issue. 

And this is in the joint appendix at -- one -- if I 

could have one moment -- begins on page 330 of the 

joint appendix -- 336, and proceeds through the court's 

discussion of the sufficiency of the evidence, in 

paragraph 17. The court concluded that there was 

sufficient evidence from which a reasonable finder of 

fact could conclude -- and it states, "reasonable 

inference thereupon that Clark knowingly and 

intentionally shot Moritz, and knew that he was a 

police officer when he did so." There's repeated 

references that the Arizona Court of Appeals did not 

understand that Arizona had somehow, by adoption of the 

Mott rule, decided to redefine the crime of first-

degree murder, and -- as it -- we point in our opening 

brief, they could not constitutionally do so. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what --

 JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, do you take that --

please. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What do you make of the 

very name that the State gave, not acquitted by reason 

-- not not-guilty by reason of insanity, but guilty, 

except insane. Guilty of what? Guilty of the charge. 

And the charge is first-degree murder. So, even if 

insanity is found, apparently that's defined to be 

"guilty of the charge, except insane," therefore not 

subject to criminal punishment. 

MR. GOLDBERG: That's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. However, guilty of the charge, based on the 

State's evidence, without any consideration of the 

defendant's evidence. In this case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But --

MR. GOLDBERG: -- we offered 16 lay witnesses 

and their testimony, in addition to the experts. And I 

want to point this -- make this point clear. The State 

wants you to believe that this issue only involves 

psychiatric expert testimony. It does not. And it 

involves lay fact evidence, just as in any trial. But 

these 16 lay witnesses talked about --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But the lay -- I'm 

sorry. That was my question. The lay --

MR. GOLDBERG: These lay witnesses --

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- witnesses still 

talked about his mental state, correct? 

MR. GOLDBERG: That's correct. But the trial 

judge ruled, under Mott, that he was precluded from 

considering all mental health evidence, all evidence of 

mental disease or defect, on the issue of mens rea. 

So, even though it was admitted, and there's no quarrel 

here that all of the evidence that we sought to present 

was admitted, it was not considered by the trial judge. 

He could not. Because the Mott rule itself is 

categorical. And I quote from the Mott decision, as 

follows, "Arizona does not allow evidence of a 

defendant's mental disorder, short of insanity, either 

as an affirmative defense or to negate the mens rea 

elements of a crime." That states "all evidence," and 

the trial judge understood it to mean that, and that's 

the way it is applied in --

JUSTICE BREYER: No --

MR. GOLDBERG: -- Arizona. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- what they have here --

the -- what the SG says -- which seemed right to me, 

and I would like you to explain why it wasn't -- is 

that as far as the insanity defense is concerned, that 

everyone in Arizona agrees that you consider whether he 

knows right from wrong in respect to this act. Thus,

if he thinks the truckdriver is an alien, or he thinks 

he's an animal, and has a serious mental problem in 

knowing what's going on, that comes right in, as it did 

here, because it's relevant to whether he knew it was 

right or wrong to shoot this person. And, therefore, 

once I read that, I thought there is not, at least in 

this case, a question of whether the insanity defense 

is complete, because it is. Everything that you wanted 

to introduce was introduced. And, indeed, it was 

considered, properly, under the insanity defense. And 

if you had convinced the jury, you would -- or the -- I 

guess, the jury -- you would have won on that. Now, am 

I -- what's wrong with what I've just said? 

MR. GOLDBERG: There is a distinction between 

nature and quality of one's acts and knowing whether an 

act is right or wrong. And the State's and the United 

States position here is not supported by the history of 

the development of M'Naghten nor the ALI version of the 

Model Penal Code. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, but I'm interested in 

Arizona, remember. I'm not -- what I'm interested in 

is whether if you say, "Judge, I am going to prove the 

following. My client knows right from wrong, in 

general, but he thought that the truckdriver was a wild 

animal, and that delusion meant that he is so insane,

he could not have formed the necessary intent." The 

judge replies, "You can bring that in, because if he 

thought the driver was a mental -- was a wild animal, 

he did not know right from wrong in respect to this 

killing." Now, is that what happened --

MR. GOLDBERG: No --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- in effect? Or would --

did the judge say, "You may not introduce that 

evidence, because it is not relevant"? 

MR. GOLDBERG: No, Justice -- the trial judge 

ruled that we could offer the evidence, because we were 

not before a jury, and the judge was the trier of fact. 

And he stated so, that he would separate out, for 

himself, what he could consider and what he could not. 

And his verdict in this case, on the "guilty, except 

insane," focused only on whether Eric knew right from 

wrong. 

JUSTICE BREYER: In this case. 

MR. GOLDBERG: In this case --

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, fine. So, then, what 

is -- would -- if he thought it was a wild animal, then 

he would not have known right from wrong in respect to 

killing that individual. 

MR. GOLDBERG: But that is not the State's 

point, or -- nor the United States Government's point

JUSTICE BREYER: What is it? 

MR. GOLDBERG: Their point is that the former 

is subsumed in the latter. In other words, it makes no 

difference. But the Arizona Court -- the Arizona 

Supreme Court, in a State Court decision, State versus 

Chavez, indicated otherwise. 

JUSTICE BREYER: No, but whether it --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I guess maybe the 

question is, What is your point? And I have the same 

question as Justice Breyer, and I'd just like to pursue 

that. 

If a case, a hypothetical case, is one in 

which the second prong of M'Naghten, knowing the 

difference in right and wrong, gets to the question of 

his capacity to form an intent, isn't that sufficient? 

I think that's Justice Breyer's question. 

MR. GOLDBERG: It would, if Arizona allowed 

consideration of that evidence. And it does not, at 

all. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But let's --

MR. GOLDBERG: Now --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Yes, but whether it does or

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- that says, "We'll let 

this evidence" --

MR. GOLDBERG: In a hypothetical --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- "in under the right-and-

wrong aspect of M'Naghten, but not under the nature and 

quality of the act." 

MR. GOLDBERG: And your question is whether -

-

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why that isn't sufficient 

to answer your contention that his intent is not -- has 

not been subject to question. 

MR. GOLDBERG: Because, first of all, it is 

not offered and is not considered to specifically 

determine whether it rebuts an inference that the State 

has raised on factual point key to their case. 

Secondly, the nature and quality is not a consideration 

in Arizona. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: What they said --

MR. GOLDBERG: And even if it was -- and I

would -- can point this out by an example that gets to 

what Justice Breyer was saying -- if a person is 

squeezing a lemon -- and this is a common example in 

law school -- and it turns out to be his sister -- he 

knows, in the abstract, that a person -- killing a 

person is right or wrong. He knows it's wrong. But he 

does not know that squeezing a lemon is wrong. 

In this case, if Eric Clark's evidence showed 

that he believed the police officer was an alien, and 

there was substantial evidence in the record to that 

effect -- and I would specifically point you to page 39 

in the joint appendix, where the -- where the expert 

testified that Eric had a heightened fear of police --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'll look at 

M'Naghten. I had thought it was whether or not the 

action was right and wrong, whether -- rather than the 

-- than the -- than the moral command was wrong. 

MR. GOLDBERG: That is correct. That is 

correct, Justice Kennedy. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Then, what do you do --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Then what you're saying, if 

I understand it, is that when the Arizona statute 

refers to whether or not the criminal act was wrong, 

the criminal act that they are referring to, on your 

view, is the act of intentional killing, period. And

if that's what they mean, then it is irrelevant that he 

thought he was killing a Martian. But if the Arizona 

reference to the criminal act being wrong refers to the 

act in this case -- i.e., killing somebody you believe 

is a Martian -- then the evidence could come in. So, I 

think your argument means -- your argument rests on 

the assumption that the Arizona statute's reference to 

the criminal act being wrong means the criminal act, in 

general, in the abstract -- i.e., intentional killing -

- as distinct from the act of killing somebody you 

believe to be a Martian. Is that correct? 

MR. GOLDBERG: Absolutely. That's not --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. GOLDBERG: -- that's not --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right, if that's --

MR. GOLDBERG: -- the end of it, as well. 

And the Model Penal Code makes this point when they 

talk about their formulation, which is a -- whether a 

defendant appreciates the wrongfulness of his conduct. 

And they, in their discussions, had indicated -- and 

these are on pages 166 and 169 of the ALI comments to 

the Model Penal Code -- that M'Naghten could, under any 

formulation -- a person could, in the abstract, know 

that killing is wrong, but could also, in the -- in the 

-- their subjective mental state, due to their mental

disease, not know that they were killing a human being. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But the Arizona Court, the 

Court of Appeals, writes that it turns on the finding 

of criminal responsibility at the time of the criminal 

offense. It is difficult to imagine that a defendant 

who did not appreciate the nature and quality of the 

act he committed would reasonably be able to perceive 

that the act was wrong. Now, those words, written by 

the Arizona Court, suggested to me that, in the case of 

the lemon you're talking about, or in the case of the 

individual who thinks that the truckdriver was a 

Martian, they would say he does not know right from 

wrong, here, now, in this case. That, it seemed to me, 

is what the Court of Appeals wrote. 

MR. GOLDBERG: That --

JUSTICE BREYER: And if that's what they 

wrote, then they don't adopt the test you're attacking; 

rather, they do let the very evidence that you want to 

come in, come in, and it is totally relevant. 

MR. GOLDBERG: They would, if it was not 

inconsistent with previous pronouncements of this very 

same court. But, although it is -- it is error to not 

instruct a jury on both prongs when Arizona had both 

prongs, it was harm -- deemed harmless error in State 

versus Chavez. But if --

MR. GOLDBERG: But not --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- if Justice Breyer --

MR. GOLDBERG: -- but that it was error, 

because they are distinct. They are distinct elements. 

And that is to suggest that a psychiatric psychosis is 

pervasive throughout an entire person's living. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But if Justice --

MR. GOLDBERG: But --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- Breyer's explanation is 

a correct statement of Arizona law, do you still have 

an argument that your proof should have been accepted, 

on the first prong? 

MR. GOLDBERG: Yes. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And what is that argument? 

MR. GOLDBERG: The argument is that the State 

proved, circumstantially, his mental state. The judge, 

as the finder of fact, never -- and stated so in his 

ruling on this issue -- could consider the lay 

testimony and the expert testimony on whether it raised 

a doubt, a single reasonable doubt as to the State's 

position. And I can point this out on four facts. 

First of all, the State sought to prove intent and 

knowledge. They did so by first arguing that Eric's 

conduct, in driving around the neighborhood with the

is in the record at -- on August 5th, in the opening 

statement by the State's attorney, page 15; on August 

27th, at page 50; and that's in the joint appendix, at 

314, in their closing argument. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And your evidence to 

the contrary that was excluded would have showed what? 

MR. GOLDBERG: That it was equally plausible 

that he was driving around with his music playing loud 

because he was drowning out the voices in his head, 

which were --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So, it went to 

diminished mental capacity. And as I understand 

Arizona law, it has decided that that evidence can only 

be presented in the context of an insanity defense. 

MR. GOLDBERG: And that is unconstitutional, 

Mr. Chief Justice. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: You mean --

MR. GOLDBERG: First of all --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- the Constitution --

MR. GOLDBERG: -- these are facts --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- requires a diminished-

capacity defense? 

MR. GOLDBERG: No, not the defense. There's 

a very subtle, but important, distinction between the

diminished-capacity defense as an affirmative defense

that --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, if you're going to let 

the evidence of diminished capacity in, on mens rea, 

you've done, by -- as it were, by the front door, what 

you can't do by the back door -- i.e., by a diminished-

capacity defense -- because you're making the same 

point. The burdens of proof are different, but you're 

making the same point. 

MR. GOLDBERG: Well, the burdens of proof 

goes to whether, if we did not -- if we did not prevail 

-- or we did prevail on the second issue, the --

whether M'Naghten allows consideration of this --

whether it makes a difference. In that situation, the 

burden of proof is on us, by clear and convincing --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Do you -- do you think it is 

unconstitutional for a State to say, "We know perfectly 

well that it is much more difficult for both cognitive 

and reason -- reasons -- and reasons of character and 

training and so on, for some people to conform 

themselves to the criminal law than others. We know 

it's harder for some than others. But we don't care 

how much harder it is, unless it gets to the point that 

we define as insanity. Because unless we require

MR. GOLDBERG: No, it's not. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. 

MR. GOLDBERG: But the --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Isn't that what the State 

does when it denies a diminished-capacity -- says, "We 

will not have a diminished-capacity defense"? 

MR. GOLDBERG: If it is framed as a defense, 

yes, but if --

JUSTICE SOUTER: Okay. Now --

MR. GOLDBERG: -- it is framed --

JUSTICE SOUTER: -- isn't --

MR. GOLDBERG: -- as simply --

JUSTICE SOUTER: With respect, isn't that 

also what the State is getting at when it says, "We 

don't allow diminished-capacity evidence in on mens 

rea, which is the State's burden. Rather, we allow it 

in only on the defense of insanity, so that we can keep 

it clear, clear that unless the diminished capacity is 

so great as to amount to insanity, it's not an excuse"? 

And if that is what the State is doing, is there any -

- anything unconstitutional about that? 

MR. GOLDBERG: The unconstitutionality of 

that -- of that procedure is that the State's evidence 

goes uncontested. The State's evidence -- the State's 

evidence -- and this has been fundamental to prove mens 

rea, along with actus, is a fundamental right of the 

defendant to present a defense to that. And we're 

talking about presenting facts, not having --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but it only --

MR. GOLDBERG: -- a psychiatrist get up there 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- goes uncontested --

MR. GOLDBERG: -- and --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- it only goes 

uncontested if the only way you're going to contest it 

is to show diminished capacity. You could have 

contested this evidence by showing that, you know, he 

was a in a rock band, and he wanted to play the music 

for -- to advertise the concert, not to lure the 

police. There are a lot of defenses you can present. 

What they're saying is, if it goes to diminished 

capacity, that has to be used to show insanity or not -

- or nothing at all. 

MR. GOLDBERG: But their justifications for 

this rule, Mr. Chief Justice, are that it's not

reliable. And it is reliable evidence. Both the lay 

testimony and expert testimony is admitted by the State 

for other purposes, as well as for the defense in other 

purposes, and has been found reliable. And this is 

cited in footnote 15 of our reply brief. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Goldberg, may I ask 

you to clarify one thing about your argument? You say 

that you should have permitted -- been permitted to 

introduce this evidence to show that this act was not -

- the "act" being, kill a police officer -- was not 

done intentionally or knowingly. But you seem to 

indicate that Clark could have been convicted, under 

the Arizona code, of some degree of murder. Am I right 

about that? And, if so, what degree? 

MR. GOLDBERG: Absolutely, Your Honor. Our 

position -- and I stated this, in fact, in my opening 

statement to the court, as well as in our motion for a 

directed verdict after the close of the State's 

evidence -- was that if the court found that the State 

had failed to prove, considering all the evidence, 

including the evidence of his mental illness, that he 

did not know he was killing a police officer, then he 

would be found guilty of second-degree murder or 

manslaughter. And that would be our position as to why 

this is unconstitutional, in part, because the State

chose to define a specific crime as requiring that 

cognitive element that he knew he was killing a police 

officer and then --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And what would --

MR. GOLDBERG: -- sought --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What --

MR. GOLDBERG: -- to preclude any 

consideration of evidence that indicated the contrary. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What was the second -- the 

definition of "second degree"? 

MR. GOLDBERG: "Second-degree murder" is 

defined as intentional murder, without premeditation. 

That's one form of second-degree murder in Arizona. 

Now, I want --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, what --

MR. GOLDBERG: -- to get back to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: May I just ask, what -- if 

the proof you'd like to introduce is that the defendant 

considered the police officer to be an alien, why would 

he have any intent? Why wouldn't your argument go, as 

well, to second degree? 

MR. GOLDBERG: Because if he knew he was 

killing what he believed to be a alien who had taken 

over a human form, then he may have known that he was 

killing somebody, but not that it was a police officer,

because, in his mind, he believed that the police 

officer was an alien. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: But it doesn't go to 

premeditation. I think that's Justice Ginsburg's 

point. And I don't see why that isn't correct. It 

doesn't got to premeditation. 

MR. GOLDBERG: No, Justice Scalia, but he was 

not charged with a premeditated murder. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but you're saying --

you're saying he could have been charged with second-

degree murder --

MR. GOLDBERG: As intentional murder. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- because -- what? 

MR. GOLDBERG: Because the -- because the 

crime of second-degree murder -- because this is a 

unique --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Does not require

MR. GOLDBERG: Right. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- don't see how this goes 

to premeditation, anyway. 

MR. GOLDBERG: Does not go to premeditation. 

Goes to the question of whether he knowingly killed a 

police officer. If you take -- second-degree murder is

degree-murder statute and adds one, and that one 

element is knowledge and intent to kill a police 

officer. And that's the additional element that makes 

second degree a lesser included defense of first 

degree. And the judge was precluded from considering 

the fact evidence in this case that indicated that Eric 

was delusional, that he was schizophrenic, that he was 

actively delusional at the time of the crime, and he 

believed that its -- our town had been inhabited by 

aliens. 

JUSTICE BREYER: All right, suppose he did, 

he believed there -- it's an alien, which is not 

immoral, to kill an alien, let's say, if he comes from 

Mars. I don't know about the morality of that, but --

[Laughter.] 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- I'll go with you. I'll 

say that you're absolutely right about that. Now, 

suppose, in addition, the judge did consider that. He 

did consider it, because he thought the person wouldn't 

know right from wrong if he thought this was an alien. 

All right? A space alien. Now, suppose that's true. 

Then what is the problem, from a due-process point of 

view? After all, you were able to make your claim 

there. The judge would have heard the evidence. And 

if the judge believed that that was so, he would have

MR. GOLDBERG: Not if it could be considered 

as to going to the element, no. But that's not this 

case. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Actually, I was --

MR. GOLDBERG: It does not go to the mental 

state, in this case, because Arizona law, under State 

v. Mott, precludes its consideration for that purpose -

 MR. GOLDBERG: That's the way the Arizona --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that your argument? 

MR. GOLDBERG: Yes. Yes. Well, that's the 

way the Arizona rule is drafted. It can go to -- if we 

can convince the trier of fact that it -- that his 

delusions prevent him from knowing the nature and 

quality of his acts, if that was actually included in 

our statute. But, in our case, we were limited to 

trying to prove his delusional behavior, his delusional 

beliefs that the officer was an alien, to show that he 

did not know right from wrong. And that was it. And 

that places the burden on us, which runs counter to the 

fundamental principles of criminal law that are set 

down in Winship, that it's the State's burden to prove, 

beyond a reasonable doubt, every element, including 

this element, and not without any opportunity of the 

defense to rebut that element. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, that's a different 

question. If, in fact, it came in via the insanity 

defense, I guess the burden is on the defendant to 

prove it. Is --

MR. GOLDBERG: Correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- that true? Well, if it 

comes in via mens rea, then the burden is on the State 

to disprove it.

JUSTICE BREYER: Doesn't the State have to

mens rea, that the mens rea was there? 

MR. GOLDBERG: Absolutely. The burden never 

JUSTICE BREYER: And so, the State --

MR. GOLDBERG: -- shifts from the State. 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- would have to show that, 

in fact, he was not so insane as to preclude intent. 

MR. GOLDBERG: In a technical sense, yes. 

But, as a practical matter, no, because the State would 

be offering all of their evidence, as they did here, to 

show that, circumstantially, he had the intent. We 

would be offering the evidence, which is regularly 

accepted and is found reliable for numerous purposes in 

our State, to show that there's a doubt as to whether 

he had that. And that's a completely different thing 

than the State attempting -- having the burden on them 

to disprove it, which this Court has so said in 

affirmative-defense cases involving self-defense, for 

example, that the State does not have to disprove that 

a person was justified or had a reasonable belief for 

their safety, but that they -- and in the same token,

you cannot prevent the jury from considering whether

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Mr.

Mr. Howe, we'll hear now from you. 

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL M. HOWE 

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 

MR. HOWE: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please 

the Court: 

The answer to both questions before this 

Court today, Do States have the -- have the discretion 

to define it -- to define the affirmative defense of 

insanity as the policymakers see fit? And they also 

have the right to protect that definition by -- as 

Justice Souter's questions indicated -- from an -- from 

an attack on that definition by having evidence of 

diminished capacity of a different -- a different 

definition of "insanity" from coming in the back door. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, to prevail, do you 

think you have to show that, under prong two of 

M'Naghten, the right-and-wrong prong, that the

defendant can prove really everything, and, in fact, 

did have the opportunity to prove everything, that he 

seeks to prove under prong one? If it's -- do you have 

to convince us of that in order to win? 

MR. HOWE: I -- no, Your Honor. There are 

two answers to that. The first answer is that the 

M'Naghten definition of "insanity," the heart of it, 

has always been the right/wrong test. And this Court, 

in Leland, and, I believe, in Powell, as well, have in 

-- have always referred to M'Naghten as the 

"right/wrong test." State courts across the country, 

they go --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But it's clear, 

Counsel, though, that the first prong of M'Naghten adds 

something different, "You don't understand the nature 

and quality of your acts." In other words, it would be 

enough, if you recognized both prongs, if he thought 

this was a Martian, regardless of whether he knew it 

was wrong to kill a Martian or not. 

MR. HOWE: Yes, that's correct, Your Honor. 

But as the lower courts spoke in M'Naghten, we don't 

look at the -- at the -- at the act in the abstract. 

As the -- as the Solicitor General's brief points out, 

it says in here, at page 16, that what the traditional 

M'Naghten test looks at was his very conduct. And as

the Arizona Court of Appeals noted, it would be -- it 

would be difficult to imagine a situation where someone 

would know his conduct was wrong, but not know the 

nature of his act. And I won't pretend that perhaps in 

some theoretical hypothetical scenario that might --

you know, that might occur. But it's very difficult, 

indeed, to imagine that. And the Arizona Legislature 

rationally could, you know -- could have, you know, 

decided that they will -- that they will reduce the 

definition to the heart of M'Naghten, which is 

right/wrong, because the -- you know, the issue of 

nature and quality will rarely, if ever, come up. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But I am correct in 

assuming that it is -- and tell me if I'm wrong -- that 

it is your position, the State's position, that, under 

the right/wrong prong-two part of M'Naghten, and under 

the evidence in this case, the court was able to 

consider, really, all of the evidence that's necessary 

in order to meet this defendant's defense as to -- as 

to intent. 

MR. HOWE: Yes, Your Honor. And so --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I agree with you. I'm 

trying to think of some theoretical case where it would 

make a difference. I can't quite come up with a 

hypothetical.

 MR. HOWE: And I've -- you know, I've worked 

with this case for several months, Your Honor, and I 

haven't come up with one either. 

JUSTICE SOUTER: Well, wouldn't it make a 

difference in a case in which an individual 

understands, number one, as a general matter, that it 

is wrong to kill people intentionally? He also 

believes that there are space aliens. And he believes 

that it is wrong to kill space aliens. But he kills 

one. Under the full M'Naghten test, under prong one, 

he would have a defense. But under the M'Naghten test 

of prong two alone, since he believed it was wrong to 

kill Martians, he wouldn't have a defense. Isn't that 

right? 

MR. HOWE: No, Your Honor, for two reasons. 

The first reason is that the heart of the M'Naghten 

test is knowing right from wrong. And if a State, in 

its -- in its discretion, wants to say that those --

that the State will not account for those rare cases 

where it might make a difference, a State could do 

that. The second answer, Your Honor, is, as M'Naghten 

says, at page 723, what we look at when we're examining 

whether the defendant knew right from wrong, is his --

is the very conduct that he committed. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Counsel, I'm puzzled about

one thing. I just -- maybe it's just my stupidity. 

But assume he thought it was a Martian, and assume he 

thought -- does he have to think it was wrong to kill 

Martians? Or supposing he thinks it is not wrong to 

kill Martians, then what do you do? Does it matter 

whether he thinks it's right or wrong to kill Martians, 

in other words? 

MR. HOWE: My point, Your Honor, is, if he is 

not actually killing a space alien, there is grave 

doubt that he would understand his conduct, and that 

would make rather meaningless, at some practical level, 

asking the question, "Did you know that your conduct 

was wrong?" 

JUSTICE STEVENS: I'm not sure I understand 

the answer. I -- that -- is it -- does he -- let me 

put it this way, and maybe you can answer yes or no. 

MR. HOWE: Sure. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Does he have to think it's 

wrong to kill Martians? 

MR. HOWE: No, Your Honor. What he -- what 

he has to understand is what he is actually doing. And 

if he doesn't actually understand that he is killing a 

human being, then it's rather academic, in abstract, to 

ask, "Did you know whether that -- did you know what 

you thought you were doing was wrong?" But at -- you

know, but, again, I suppose, hypothetically, there may 

be -- you know, there may be a case where that would 

make a difference. But the State is clearly free to 

recognize that that's an incredibly rare circumstance 

and that, "As a matter of policy, we're not going to 

clutter up the definition of 'insanity' with that." It 

could -- you know, adding that language, a policymaker 

could very well decide that would be distracting to a 

jury or a factfinder. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: The thing that troubles me, 

just to -- and then you can comment on it -- I'm 

assuming it's possible they thought he didn't know 

whether it was a Martian or not, and that he thought he 

had a mission in life to kill Martians, that they're 

enemies, they're bad to come, and he wants to kill 'em. 

If that was the -- what the trial court found, could 

he be put to death for that killing? 

MR. HOWE: That would raise serious Eighth 

Amendment concerns, Your Honor, and --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Or could he just be found 

guilty of murder, or whatever, on those facts? 

MR. HOWE: If he truly believed that he was 

shooting an alien when he was actually shooting a human 

being, he would -- he would certainly have, you know, a 

very strong case for insanity. But what the factfinder

MR. HOWE: Surely. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: And I'm just wondering if 

he's -- just raises a doubt as -- so there's not proof 

beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew the person he 

was killing was either a human being or an -- a kind of 

individual that it would be wrong to kill. 

MR. HOWE: Well --

JUSTICE STEVENS: If there's just a 

reasonable doubt on the issue --

MR. HOWE: Well --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- would he be guilty, or 

not? 

MR. HOWE: Well, Your Honor, that raises the 

second issue that we're -- that we're discussing today, 

that, you know, the State, as I've argued, has the 

right to define "insanity" as it -- as it sees fit. 

And if you -- if you -- if a -- if a State allows

evidence, that doesn't rise to the standard of 

insanity, to come in, then you -- then he's able to 

raise whatever his personal definition of "insanity" is 

through the back door. And the State has a great 

interest in preserving its definition of "insanity," 

and its ability to define "insanity" as it sees fit by, 

as we argued --

JUSTICE STEVENS: But, as you say, it's -- in 

a way, it's -- in a sense, it comes in through the back 

door, as you say, but, even coming in through the back 

door, if it raises a reasonable doubt as to his intent 

to kill a -- make a wrongful killing, why shouldn't it 

be admissible? 

MR. HOWE: It should -- it isn't -- it isn't 

admissible, Your -- a State can preclude it, Your 

Honor, because the State has the definite right to 

define the element of mens rea, and it is -- again, as 

it sees fit. And as --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Does that mean that it 

could also exclude the testimony from the lay people or 

the friends who talked about this person's illness?

defect, whether it's expert testimony or lay testimony, 

does not come in under Mott. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Howe, would you 

explain to me how the State has proved intentional --

not intentional killing, but of a police officer? If 

that's the charge, that he intended to kill a police 

officer, how does the State meet its burden on a police 

officer if the testimony on the other side is, "I did 

not understand that this human that I killed was a 

police officer"? 

MR. HOWE: What the -- what the State proved 

in this case, Your Honor, is that, at least, you know, 

2 weeks prior to the murder, he indicated a desire to 

do -- to do something extremely similar to what he --

you know, to what he actually did. There was testimony 

he had -- he had an extreme dislike toward police 

officers. On the -- at the time of the killing, 

Officer Moritz was in -- was in a marked police car, he 

had a uniform, he turned on his lights and siren, and 

Clark -- you know --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I see that on the --

MR. HOWE: -- pulled over. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the State side, so the 

State has introduced evidence from which a trier could 

conclude he intended to kill a police officer. But he

wants to introduce, on the other side, "I didn't have

killed an alien." But he's not allowed to introduce 

that evidence --

MR. HOWE: Yes --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- to counter --

MR. HOWE: -- Your Honor. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- the State's proof, as I 

understand what the Arizona law is. 

MR. HOWE: Sure. What the Arizona Supreme 

Court recognized in Mott was -- what the Arizona 

Legislature did when it enacted its criminal code and 

it defined its mens rea, it defined the mens rea in 

such a way -- you know, just as you -- you know, 

just as you explained in Egelhoff, Your Honor, that the 

-- that the condition of mental disease or defect does 

not negate the mens rea. So, what the State has --

what the State has to prove, in general, and had to 

prove in this specific case, is, the State had to prove 

that Clark either, one, actually had the -- had the 

intent to kill a police officer, at least knowing he 

was a police officer, or killed under -- or killed 

under circumstances that would indicate that he, 

knowing -- at least knowingly killed a police officer, 

but for his mental illness. It's --

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is this an alternative 

argument, so that, if we accept this argument, we need 

not ask whether the evidence comes in under prong two, 

or is this complementary to the argument that the 

evidence comes in under prong two? 

MR. HOWE: I -- I'm not quite sure how to 

answer that, Your Honor. What we -- what we've argued, 

the -- you know, as far as the first issue, is that a 

State is free to define "insanity" as it -- as it sees 

fit, under most, if not all, cases -- or most, if all 

real cases. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Why is that, Counsel? 

Let's suppose that the -- one of the cases that come 

up is a language difficulty. The individual -- maybe 

he's not in uniform -- identifies himself as a police 

officer. Could the State have a rule that, "We are not 

going to allow evidence of language concerns," that the 

individual didn't speak English, and the officer said, 

"I'm a police officer," so he didn't know, when he shot 

him? What is it about mental capacity that allows you 

to exclude that type of evidence? 

MR. HOWE: Surely, Your Honor. This Court 

has always noted that evidence of mental disease or 

defect is viewed quite skeptically, because lawyers and 

psychiatrists and psychologists very often can't agree

on the meaning or the value or the validity of 

psychiatric evidence. The State also has an -- has an 

interest in preventing someone, who has -- you know, 

who -- there's at least a serious question of mental 

illness, from being able to forgo an insanity defense, 

but raise evidence to negate mens rea, in the hopes 

that he would walk free instead of being found "guilty, 

except insane," and sent to the State hospital. 

There's also -- you know, a third policy reason, that, 

because you -- in your -- because the -- you know, 

because the gross question of whether someone is insane 

or sane is a difficult enough question with psychiatric 

evidence, it raises -- it raises the question to a 

whole other level of complexity to ask the juries, 

"Well, if we -- if you find that he is sane, but he has 

some degree of mental illness, just find -- you know, 

just how did that mental illness affect his ability to 

intend." And the State, as a matter of policy, you 

know, may properly say, "That is -- you know, we're 

finding on the nature to determine whether someone's 

insane or not," but it's just too complex a question 

to ask the -- a jury or a judge, as in this case, to 

make fine gradations of ability and responsibility. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Howe, one of the 

things that puzzled me about your position is, you

said, "Under Arizona law, while this doesn't come in 

under mens rea, it does affect sentencing." I think 

you said that the -- his mental state is properly taken 

into account in the sentencing. And, by that, did you 

mean just the length of the incarceration, or the place 

of the incarceration? 

MR. HOWE: Your Honor, my time is up. May --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You can -- may 

answer. 

MR. HOWE: Surely. What -- under Arizona 

law, if you have a mental illness, that does not rise 

to the level of insanity if the -- if the -- if the 

trial court or the jury finds that circumstance exists 

by a preponderance of the evidence and it can be found 

as a mitigating circumstance, that he -- that can, in a 

given case, reduce the sentence imposed. 

Thank you very much.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENT 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

Arizona has decided to adopt a particular

form of the insanity defense, and it has also decided 

to protect that substantive decision by channeling 

evidence about a defendant's mental capacity into an 

affirmative defense with the burden squarely on the 

defendant. Neither aspect of that judgment violates 

the Federal Constitution. 

And I think, with respect to the substantive 

decision, there are two elements to it. First of all, 

Arizona wanted to streamline consideration of M'Naghten 

and focus on the heart of M'Naghten, which is the 

right/wrong test. But, equally important, as far back 

as 1965, in the Schantz case, where they first came up 

with the rule applied in Mott, they also wanted to not 

have a diminished-capacity defense in the State of 

Arizona. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Could the State say that 

it's the defendant's burden to show that it was not a 

police officer? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think the State --

could the State do that? Is that the question? 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think the State --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because the next question 

is, Why didn't they -- isn't that what happened here? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Right. I don't think they

could do that. And I don't think that's what happened 

here. And I think if you look at the evidence in this 

case -- I mean, it came in, in sort of a strange way, 

in part, I think, because it was a bench trial, but I 

think what the trial court did is say that, "All of the 

evidence on insanity, all of the evidence in the second 

phase of the case, is relevant. It's all coming in. 

I'm going to take it into consideration, but I'm going 

to take it into consideration only on the insanity 

defense, not as part of the mens rea defense." And I 

think that was consistent with Arizona law. What I 

think would be a harder question -- and let me just 

say, I think the way that this was postured for the 

trial court was that the Petitioner argued that all of 

that evidence comes in for consideration of the mens 

rea. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It seems to me that you 

introduced the -- my concern by saying that they -- the 

State can put the burden of proof on the defendant, 

which we know is generally true in many States with 

reference to the insanity defense. But when you link 

it with mens rea, then it seems to me you have a 

problem. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I don't think so, 

Justice Kennedy, but you're absolutely right to say

that there's this tradition with insanity, which is 

quite different than the tradition with respect to 

other elements of a crime. And I think that goes back 

to the common law, and goes back to Blackstone. And if 

you look at Blackstone, and you look at some of the 

common law cases that this Court cited in its Davis 

opinion, they describe murder as having several 

elements. One of them is obviously killing a person, 

and one is malice aforethought. And then, some of the 

cases treat a sound mind as a separate element. But, I 

think, if you look at the history, it's clear it wasn't 

a true element, because the common law put the -- it 

started with a presumption of sanity, which you 

couldn't have with respect to any other element, and 

said it was perfectly appropriate to put the burden on 

the defendant. 

And I think what the common law recognizes is 

the question of criminal responsibility or insanity, 

although it has some logical relationship to mens rea, 

can be separated out and can be dealt with in an 

affirmative defense. And I think if you don't 

recognize the State's ability to do that, you end up 

allowing a defendant to basically sneak in, through, as 

Justice Souter put it, the front door, all sorts of 

watered-down insanity defenses in the guise of

arguments trying to negate mens rea. 

JUSTICE KENNEDY: It does seem as if the 

argument, that, "Oh, this all comes in under second --

under the second prong," means that if there's a --

there's another inference. It's a -- it's a secondhand 

argument about lack of mens rea. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, it -- I think, 

Justice Kennedy, though --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Kind of, the second-class --

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- sort of evidence. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- I don't think it's 

second class. I think what Arizona recognized, in the 

Schantz case and in Mott, in making this rule in the 

context of rejecting the diminished-capacity defense, 

is that if you allow a defendant to argue, "My evidence 

shows that I lack the capacity to form the requisite 

mental state; and, therefore, that comes in on the mens 

rea case," you can make that argument in terms of any 

insanity defense you like. I can argue that, "I lack 

the capacity to form the requisite intent, because I 

responded to an irresistible impulse." Well, a State 

that's decided to have the M'Naghten insanity defense, 

rather than the irresistible-impulse defense, has to be 

able to make the judgment, I submit, that, "We're going

to have the M'Naghten defense, and we're going to keep 

it as an affirmative defense, and we're not going to 

allow that defense, that we've rejected, to effectively 

come in through the front door." And, to use Justice 

Souter's --

JUSTICE BREYER: That would present a serious 

constitutional question, wouldn't it? Or what -- I 

mean, I -- that's -- but I thought some of these 

questions might be in this case, but I now doubt -- I'm 

having doubts about that. But suppose the State so 

limits the defense that an individual defendant, who, 

by any ordinary psychiatric test, would be viewed as 

seriously insane, and, therefore, not a person who is 

capable of being held responsible in any moral sense 

for the crime, is, nonetheless, going to be convicted 

of murder? I mean -- and that might be -- come up with 

irresistible impulse, because the person is totally 

insane, not like any other human being. Anyone would 

normally say he lacked the knowledge of -- he's not 

responsible for what he does. And then, the State, 

nonetheless, convicts him of murder. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: But, Justice Breyer, they 

wouldn't convict him for murder, because he would 

qualify for an insanity defense. And somebody as 

insane as you're --

JUSTICE BREYER: But that's not in this case, 

I agree with you.

JUSTICE BREYER: But is a variation of that 

in this case -- namely, the variation -- but we've 

discussed that at length, and I take it you think 

that's not in this case. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think it's in this 

case, but I don't want to mislead you, which is as -- I 

think you can hypothesize a situation where somebody 

would be exonerated by one form of the insanity 

defense, and not exonerated by a narrow form of the 

insanity defense. And I don't think it follows that 

somebody that's in that margin has a constitutional 

right to make up the difference, effectively, through a 

mens rea argument. And, otherwise, I think you -- I 

mean, you --

JUSTICE BREYER: But we don't have to reach 

that question here, in your view.

in on the back door through the insanity defense. 

JUSTICE BREYER: But if we have to reach it, 

this -- they're arguing we do, because they're saying 

the person is so insane he doesn't know whether this is 

a human being or a sack of lemons. Now --

GENERAL CLEMENT: But then he --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- he said that they didn't 

consider that in the insanity defense. And he's not 

attacking the burden of proof, at least not in this 

Court. And so, I -- do you think we do have to -- that 

we have to --

GENERAL CLEMENT: I --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- assume that he's right on 

that? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think you have to 

reach that question here. But you do have to reach a 

related question, I think, which is, I think the trial 

court here very clearly, in applying Mott, prevented 

the Petitioner from making a diminished-capacity 

argument. And then --

capacity," if it is -- what is that? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: It's an argument that is 

basically a variation on the insanity defense. It's 

partial responsibility. It was basically the governing 

law in California until it was --

JUSTICE BREYER: But partial responsibility 

does not -- insanity -- they use the words "insanity" 

and "diminished responsibility." I took the word 

"insanity" to mean the kind of mental state that would, 

in fact, show a lack of intent. I took the word 

"diminished responsibility" to mean there is intent, 

but it's excusable. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I think you can draw that --

JUSTICE BREYER: Now, am I --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- distinction, but I do 

want to make clear that there are arguments here that 

you could make in a different State that you can't make 

in Arizona because of the substantive decision that, 

"We don't want to have a diminished-capacity defense, 

and we don't want to have that policy judgment 

frustrated by having the evidence come in through the 

front door." And to use Justice --

Supposing the evidence is equally divided on the 

question of whether he thought it was a Martian who he 

had a right to kill. Could he be convicted of murder, 

constitutionally? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I think he could, Justice 

Stevens. As I understand --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Because then --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- the hypothetical, we're 

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- there would be --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- basically --

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- not proof beyond a 

reasonable doubt that he knew he was killing a human 

being, and it was wrong to do so. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well, I think it would --

it might depend on exactly what the statutory 

definition of "murder" in the State was. 

JUSTICE STEVENS: Well, I don't -- I don't --

I'm just wondering, as a constitutional matter, 

forgetting all the -- as a constitutional matter, can a 

man be convicted of murder if the evidence is equally 

balanced on the question of whether he knew it -- he 

did anything wrong and -- or knew that he was killing a 

human being? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Maybe not, Justice Stevens.

It just depends on the way that the statute deals with 

it. Because, in my view of the statute, if somebody 

really thought -- if they had to kill a human being, 

and they thought, "I wasn't doing it. I was killing an 

alien," maybe that could come in, on mens rea, but if --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Have we ever held that an 

insanity defense is required, that a State cannot 

simply abolish insanity defenses? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: No, Justice Scalia, you 

have not held --

but, equally, I don't think a State would -- is 

required to have a diminished-capacity defense. And --

JUSTICE ALITO: Well, is a State required to 

adopt any particular mens rea for murder? Is there a 

constitutional requirement as to the minimum mens rea 

that can be -- can be set for the offense of murder? 

GENERAL CLEMENT: I don't think so. I mean, 

I think it's very difficult to find, in the Due Process 

Clause, the tools necessary to superintend those kind --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But here, there --

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- of decisions. 

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- was a charge, "intended 

to kill a police officer." It could have been just

"intended to kill." And I think Mr. Goldberg conceded 

that "intended to kill" would have been a proper 

conviction, but not "intended to kill a police officer" 

GENERAL CLEMENT: Well --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- unless he's allowed to 

counter that add-on. 

GENERAL CLEMENT: With respect, Justice 

Ginsburg, I think that starts to confuse the 

hypotheticals with the real case, because I don't think 

Petitioner's argument was that they had no idea that 

this person was a police officer, and he thought he was 

killing an alien. I think their argument was much more 

one for insanity, and that maybe there were other 

explanations for the conduct. But the psychological 

testimony here suggests that maybe he sometimes thought 

that his mother was also an alien, but he kind of knew 

it was his mother, as well. And so, I don't really 

think that maps up with the argument they've made. 

The one point I want to leave you with, 

though, is, as Justice Souter said, everybody agrees 

that there's no due-process requirement that Arizona 

have a diminished-capacity defense. Well, it doesn't 

make any sense to say that they have to have that 

implicitly with the burden on the State at the same

Thank you.

Mr. Goldberg, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. GOLDBERG 

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

MR. GOLDBERG: There is a due-process 

guarantee that the defendant can present evidence in 

his own defense. No matter how the Chambers line of 

cases is viewed by the court, this Court made clear, 

in Montana v. Egelhoff, that in the absence of any 

valid State justification -- and I'm quoting now, from 

the plurality decision -- "exclusion of exculpatory 

evidence deprives the defendant -- it's very basic to 

have the prosecutor's case encounter and survive the 

crucible of meaningful adversarial testing." And that 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But that certainly 

doesn't include the right to present any evidence you 

want. 

MR. GOLDBERG: It's the difference between --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You couldn't have 

presented evidence that this person was, in fact, a 

Martian. 

MR. GOLDBERG: That's correct, Mr. Chief

Justice. And it's not that we're asking to -- this 

Court to affirmatively rule that all of this evidence 

comes in, just that all of it cannot be excluded, per 

se, and that the trial judge is, just as in any other 

type of evidence, any other fact or opinion evidence, 

serves as the gatekeeper under the rules of evidence to 

decide whether it's more prejudicial or it's more 

probative. But Arizona has decided, only for this 

purpose, that this evidence is inherently unreliable. 

And then they've taken it to the point where they have 

proven somebody guilty of murder in the first degree of 

killing a police officer without allowing him to raise 

a reasonable doubt as to whether he knew he was killing 

a police officer. And that specific argument was made, 

contrary to what the Solicitor just stated, in my 

motion for directed verdict that I made in this case. 

JUSTICE ALITO: Was it a reasonable question 

whether he knew it was a police officer or whether he 

knew it was a human being? 

MR. GOLDBERG: Whether it was a police 

officer. I moved the court for a directed verdict at 

the close of the State's evidence, and argued to the 

court that if he found -- the judge, as the factfinder 

-- that, in his delusional mind -- and again re-urged 

this at the close of our evidence -- that he believed

he was killing a police officer, then the court could 

find him guilty of second-degree murder or 

manslaughter. And I asked the court to do that, and 

the court refused to do that. 

So, the --

JUSTICE BREYER: In the --

MR. GOLDBERG: -- court precluded any 

consideration of this evidence. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, I -- the best I can 

find in that Court of Appeals opinion, at the moment, 

is that they do reject the idea of diminished 

responsibility, on Mott -- on the ground of Mott. 

That's true. They say, "Don't even consider it." But 

I didn't think diminished responsibility went to the 

question of whether he had the requisite intent. I 

thought insanity went to that, as they use those words. 

What is "diminished responsibility," if it isn't, "We 

admit the intent -- we admit that he intended to kill 

the individual, knew it was wrong, but he isn't as 

responsible as an ordinary person would be"? What is -

-

MR. GOLDBERG: It's not --

JUSTICE BREYER: -- it, if it isn't that? 

MR. GOLDBERG: It's a fact that -- a fact 

that he did not know he was killing a police officer.

 JUSTICE BREYER: He thought he was killing 

another individual. 

MR. GOLDBERG: Correct. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Does that --

MR. GOLDBERG: Or an alien. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Does the State have to --

does the Constitution have to let you off if that's the 

situation? 

MR. GOLDBERG: It's not "let you off," with 

all due respect. It's "judge somebody based on" --

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, you --

MR. GOLDBERG: -- "their personal" --

JUSTICE BREYER: All right, but --

MR. GOLDBERG: -- "culpability." 

JUSTICE BREYER: -- but does the State have 

to say, "We are going to convict you of a lesser 

offense," in the Constitution? 

MR. GOLDBERG: The State -- the State has to 

allow the defendant to present his evidence and have it 

considered, if it's relevant, nonprivileged, and 

reliable, for a proper purpose. And here, it was 

offered for a proper purpose, just as in Chambers and 

in Rock, and in all the cases that have been before 

this Court, where this Court has held so. 

I wanted to add -- answer one question that

was raised earlier about whether a State could define 

"murder" without a requisite mens rea, essentially, 

which is -- or a specific intent, as the State seems to 

suggest that Arizona has done, inferentially, under the 

Mott decision. This Court held, in 1895, in Davis 

versus United States, that, "No one" -- and I'm quoting 

here -- "No one, we assume, would wish either the 

courts or juries, when trying a case of murder, to 

disregard the main principle existing at common law and 

recognized in all cases tending to support the charge 

below to make a complete crime cognizable by human 

laws, which includes mens rea and an actus rea." 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

[Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.]
