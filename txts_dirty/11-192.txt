Mr. Srinivasan. 


6  ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN 


7  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 


8  MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, 


9 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 


This Court's decisions have long established 

11 that Congress will be deemed to have waived the 

12 Government's sovereign immunity only if it unequivocally 

13 expresses its intent to do so. 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Under your view, is 

there any situation today where the Tucker Act would be 

16 applied to a statute? Because if we start with the 

17 statute, which always seems to be where you're pointing 

18 us to, and we're only looking for a clear waiver of 

19 sovereign immunity, then there’ll never be another 

Tucker Act action in the future. 

21  MR. SRINIVASAN: There are such statutes, 

22 Justice Sotomayor. Of course --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What would they look 

24 like to be able to get around our clear statement rule? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, they would have two

Official 

1 features consistent with this Court's decisions that 

2 have found the Tucker Act to be applicable. One would 

3 be that the statute does not contain its own remedial 

4 mechanism, and the second would be that the substantive 

obligations in the statute run against the United 

6 States, and the United States alone. 

7  And an example of that type of statute is 

8 the one that this Court found to be supported by the 

9 Tucker Act in White Mountain Apache Tribe or in Mitchell 

II. Those are the kinds of statutes as to which I think 

11 the Tucker Act was meant to apply. 

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So basically -- I'm not 

13 sure why we're even addressing the issue of Tucker Act 

14 jurisdiction. We should have really just been briefing 

the issue of whether the statute at issue here waives 

16 sovereign immunity --

17  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, of course --

18  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because that becomes, 

19 to you, the operative question. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: It does when they're 

21 dealing with the statute like this. 

22  And, of course, the reason that we’re 

23 addressing Tucker Act immunity is because Tucker Act 

24 immunity is the basis for jurisdiction in this case 

according to the reasoning of the Federal circuit. 

4

Official 

1  And the problem with the reasoning of the 


2 Federal circuit is it allows the litigant to readily 


3 circumvent the Court's strict test for sovereign 


4 immunity waivers by the straightforward device of 


adding the Tucker Act as a jurisdictional basis in the 

6 complaint. 

7  And it's not at all clear why a plaintiff 

8 couldn't do that for any claim under any statute, 

9 including a statute as to which this Court would have 

already concluded that the unequivocal expression test, 

11 the standard test applied for waivers of sovereign 

12 immunity, was not satisfied. 

13  Now, to give the Court a concrete example of 

14 this, in Lane v. Pena, the court concluded that for 

Rehabilitation Act claims under Section 504 of the 

16 Rehabilitation Act, there was no unequivocal expression 

17 of an intent to waive sovereign immunity by Congress for 

18 purposes of damages claims; and, therefore, a 

19 damages claim can't be brought against the United States 

under Section 504. 

21  But under the Federal circuit's approach, 

22 there’s no apparent reason why a plaintiff couldn't 

23 bring a damages claim against the United States for a 

24 violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by 

adding the Tucker Act to the jurisdictional bases in the 

5
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



Official 

1 complaint. Because if the plaintiff were able to do 


2 that, notwithstanding this Court's decision in 


3 Lane V. Pena, the result would be that the plaintiff 


4 could say, the Federal circuit, you should look at the 


5 statute and ask the question whether it can be fairly 


6 interpreted to mandate the payment of money by the 


7 Government. 


8  There’s no unequivocal expression of an 


9 intent to waive sovereign immunity, but that doesn't 


10 detract from the ability of the Federal circuit to 

11 conclude that the statute, nonetheless, can be fairly 

12 interpreted to mandate the payment of money. 

13  Now, of course, if that issue were to arise, 

14 we would make the argument that the statute can't be so 

15 read. But the possibility that a plaintiff could make 

16 that argument, notwithstanding this Court's decision in 

17 Lane V. Pena, we think reinforces the need to 

18 conclude -- to conclude that the Tucker Act can't be 

19 applied in the way that the Federal circuit sought to 

20 apply it here. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Could I ask you --

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Srinivasan --

23  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I’m sorry, I was going to 

24 ask -- following up on my question --

Official 

1  MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure. 

2  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- many courts have held 

3 that the FLSA has an express waiver of sovereign 

4 immunity. And many of them have recognized, if not all, 

a Tucker Act remedy. 

6  Under your new approach, that holding is 

7 incorrect, I presume --

8  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, the --

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because the FLSA has 

its own remedial scheme? 

11  MR. SRINIVASAN: I think one -- one way to 

12 look at the FLSA, if we're looking at it in the first 

13 instance, would be to conclude that the FLSA itself has 

14 a waiver of sovereign immunity. And so you wouldn't 

look to the Tucker Act as the basis for the waiver of 

16 sovereign immunity, and you would look at FSLA in the 

17 way that we think you should look at FCRA -- excuse me, 

18 the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA. 

19  Now, Your Honor is correct that there is a 

body of court of claims jurisprudence that doesn't 

21 necessarily view the statute in that way. But if you 

22 apply the framework that we think is the correct one to 

23 apply, as we set forth in our brief, you might reach the 

24 same conclusion under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 

although under a slightly different route.

Official 

1  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But then the Federal 

2 circuit has no jurisdiction over those claims, according 

3 to you, because the waiver is in the FLSA, it has its 

4 own judicial remedy. They’re not authorized, then, to 

go to --

6  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it would depend. 

7 There is a little bit of an anomaly in the FLSA because 

8 the FLSA doesn't necessarily point to any particular 

9 court as the basis of jurisdiction. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It has the same language 

11 as here, in -- you can bring your suit in any Federal or 

12 state court of competent jurisdiction. 

13  MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. It says: "In any 

14 Federal or state court of competent jurisdiction," but 

this statute specifically allows for claims to be 

16 brought in district courts and a court of competent 

17 jurisdiction. 

18  So one way --

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I don't know -- I don't 

see the difference between --

21  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I think one way to 

22 potentially see the difference -- and I'm not going to 

23 quibble with -- with what Your Honor's saying, but one 

24 way to potentially see a difference is because the FLSA 

only refers to courts of competent jurisdiction -- it

Official 

1 doesn't have a free-standing provision that reversed the 

2 district courts -- it's possible to read that statute as 

3 essentially incorporating the Tucker Act as setting 

4 forth what the court of competent jurisdiction would be. 

Here, 1681(p), which is set forth at 13(a) 

6 and 14(a) of the appendix to the Government's brief, 

7 speaks specifically about actions being brought under 

8 FCRA in any appropriate United States District Court, 

9 and then only, it goes on to talk about, or in any other 

court of competent jurisdiction. 

11  So that's a potential basis for drawing a 

12 distinction between the two. 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Srinivasan, what you say 

14 has a good deal to recommend it, and it's basically, you 

know, why should we read the Tucker Act to reverse 

16 everything that we know about sovereign immunity, but 

17 it's really hard to get that from the text of this --

18 the Tucker Act. 

19  In fact -- I mean, I guess my question is: 

Do you have any textual argument for the result that you 

21 are asking us to reach? 

22  MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure. I do, Your Honor. 

23 The text of the Tucker Act, it's true, if you read the 

24 text to apply to its full potential reach, then the 

argument would be more difficult; but, the text of the

Official 

1 Tucker Act has never been read that way, including by 

2 this Court itself, starting with Nichols v. United 

3 States --

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, that's not really a 

textual argument. That's an argument about how we've 

6 sensibly limited the reach of the Tucker Act. But the 

7 Tucker Act does seem to include what your friend there 

8 says it includes --

9  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I guess --

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- against any statute. Not 

11 any statute except the ones with remedial provisions, 

12 but just any statute. 

13  MR. SRINIVASAN: Sure. I guess you -- you 

14 -- if you read the Tucker Act to its full textual reach, 

I think we would have a more difficult case. But our 

16 argument is that when the statute refers to claims 

17 founded on any act of Congress, it was never intended to 

18 apply literally to any conceivable act of Congress. 

19 And, in fact, this Court's own test for money 

mandating -- the money mandating test that applies to 

21 the Tucker Act embodies that understanding because --

22  JUSTICE SCALIA: I assume you’re appealing 

23 to the textual principle that the specific governs the 

24 general. Isn't that what's going on here? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: We're appealing --

10
 
Alderson Reporting Company

25

Official 

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: That the Tucker Act is a 

2 more general provision, and you are saying it's -- it's 

3 overcome by a more specific provision that provides for 

4 compensation, but excludes the Federal Government. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: We're certainly relying on 

6 that, Justice Scalia, when you're asking whether the 

7 Tucker Act can be used as the basis for waiving 

8 sovereign immunity for claims under the Fair Credit 

9 Reporting Act. So when you bring the Fair Credit 

Reporting Act into play, yes, we're absolutely relying 

11 on the specific versus the general proposition, as this 

12 Court has relied on in any number of cases. 

13  I guess I understood Justice Kagan's 

14 question to be talking about the Tucker Act and the 

Tucker Act alone, without bringing into play any other 

16 statute. Now, I take Your Honor's point that it's hard 

17 to conceive of the Tucker Act in that kind of isolated 

18 fashion, because usually you'll be asking a question 

19 whether a claim can be brought against the United States 

under some other statutory regime. 

21  And so if that statutory regime includes its 

22 own remedial mechanism, as FCRA does, it's hard to avoid 

23 resort to the specific control as a general proposition. 

24  But the other point about construing the 

text of the Tucker Act alone is that the Tucker Act is a 

11
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5

25

Official 

1 waiver of sovereign immunity. And so the canon that we 

2 construe waivers of sovereign immunity strictly comes 

3 into play when we construe the terms of the Tucker Act 

4 itself. And I think it stands to reason that when you 

apply that canon, you wouldn't read the Tucker Act to 

6 encompass fully any act of Congress, because the 

7 implications for waivers of sovereign immunity would be 

8 quite substantial. 

9  And so the Court has never construed the 

Tucker Act that way, and it shouldn't countenance that 

11 kind of construction now, which is effectively what the 

12 Federal Circuit's interpretation allows, because, rather 

13 than applying the strict standard under which Congress 

14 would have to be seen to have unequivocally expressed an 

intent to waive the Government's sovereign immunity in 

16 the terms of FCRA, it allows a plaintiff to avoid that 

17 by simply resorting to the Tucker Act in the 

18 jurisdictional basis of a complaint, and getting the 

19 real act by the Federal Circuit's own description 

standard that applies to the Tucker Act. 

21  JUSTICE GINSBURG: The United States -- the 

22 United States is governed by the substance of the Credit 

23 Reporting Act. The Act applies to the Government, but 

24 your point is there's no sanction for 

noncompliance, even though the United States, a

25

Official 

1 Government system, is supposed to conform to the 

2 standards in the Act. 

3  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I guess a few 

4 responses, Justice Ginsburg. First, on the question of 

whether the United States is subject to the substantive 

6 obligations in FCRA, I don't know that's there's a one 

7 size fits all answer. I think you'd have to go 

8 provision by provision and make an assessment. 

9  And the reason I would say that is that, 

with respect to certain provisions at least, there are 

11 other statutes that, depending on the provision, have a 

12 specific obligation against the Government. And I'm 

13 thinking in particular of the Debt Collection 

14 Improvements Act, the Privacy Act in certain contexts. 

And so you have -- you have to ask the question whether, 

16 with respect to the particular FCRA provision that's 

17 alleged to run against the United States, would the 

18 better basis for finding the United States' obligations 

19 be some other statute that speaks more specifically to 

the question. 

21  So I'm resisting the notion that the -- the 

22 FCRA's references to "person" in all of its substantive 

23 obligations would necessarily encompass the Government. 

24 Now, there's at least one provision as to which we don't 

deny that the Government is covered, and that's 

13
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

Official 

1 1681(b)(b)(b), and that provision is set forth at pages --

2 at page 7a of the appendix to the Government's brief. 

3  And with respect to the particular provision 

4 at issue in this case, the truncation provision, I guess 

we don't have to confront the question of whether the 

6 Government is bound by that provision. It might well 

7 be, but we don't have to confront that question, because 

8 the Government acts as if it's in compliance with that 

9 provision because it has to. 

There's a series of network agreements that 

11 the Government has entered into with credit card 

12 companies that allow the Government to participate in 

13 the credit card system. As a condition --

14  JUSTICE SCALIA: Excuse me. 1681b(b)(b), 

you said? Where is that case? 

16  MR. SRINIVASAN: 1681(b)(b). If you look 

17 at --

18  JUSTICE SCALIA: You said 7a. 

19  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I'm sorry. It starts 

at 4a. And the -- 4a, permissible purposes of 

21 Government reports; the conditions for furnishing. And 

22 then if you go to 7a -- that's also part of (b)(b) --

23 b(b)4 has an exception for national security 

24 investigations. And it talks at (b)(b)(4)(A) about "in 

the case of an agency or department of the United States 

14
 
Alderson Reporting Company 



5
10

15

20

25

1 Government which seeks to obtain and use." And because 

2 there's a reference to the United States Government in 

3 that provision --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: Right. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: -- it stands to reason that 

6 the term "person" in (b)(b) -- which starts at 4a; 

7 excuse me -- encompasses the United States Government. 

8  I guess the short answer, Justice Ginsburg, 

9 is I don't think that there is a one size fits all 

answer. But the other part of your question is, are we 

11 taking the position that even if substantive obligations 

12 run against the United States, there still wouldn't be a 

13 remedy, at least a remedy in damages against the United 

14 States? And the answer to that is yes. 

But that's not at all atypical under this 

16 Court's sovereign immunity jurisprudence, and it's not 

17 at all atypical for Congress to have fashioned a scheme 

18 that runs in that way. And the Privacy Act at least is 

19 one example, where in the Privacy Act, which applies to 

the Government and the Government alone, there are 

21 certain obligations that the Government has to comply 

22 with in that statute. 

23  But Congress is very careful to cabin the 

24 circumstances in which the Government would be subject 

to liability and money damages.

Official 

1  JUSTICE SCALIA: Still in all, your argument 

2 is -- is not just a straightforward specific governs the 

3 general argument. I mean, that would be the case if --

4 if the other statute which the plaintiff is trying to 

run around through the Tucker Act specifically -- it 

6 clearly prohibits suit against the Government. Then you 

7 would say, you know, the specific governs the general 

8 even though the govern -- the Tucker Act permits it; this 

9 statute prohibits it. 

But you're saying this other statute here 

11 does not really prohibit it. You're just saying this 

12 other statute does not permit it under our usual rules 

13 about waiver of sovereign immunity being strictly 

14 construed. So, you know, it's a -- it's a -- it's a 

difference -- it's an odd sort of a specific governs the 

16 general argument. 

17  MR. SRINIVASAN: I think, with respect, 

18 Justice Scalia, I think that's a distinction that 

19 ultimately doesn't make a difference in the context of 

this case. In the prior cases in which this Court has 

21 applied the specific over the general canon in related 

22 contexts, it's true that the statutes in some situations 

23 contemplated liability against the United States, but it 

24 had -- that statute would have certain limitations. 

And I'm thinking, for example, of Hinck, of

1 Erika, of Brown v. General Services Administration, 

2 cases like that, and Sheehan. And what the Court said 

3 was, where a statute provides for liability against the 

4 United States, but in certain situations, you don't look 

to a different statute, the Tucker Act, to circumvent 

6 those kinds of limitations. 

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: No, but that's -- that's 

8 because the negative implication of that statute is --

9 affirms that there is no liability of the United States. 

Okay? But here, you don't have -- you don't have that 

11 negative implication at all, do you? 

12  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I guess -- I don't 

13 think we need to have that negative implication to that 

14 full extent in order to invoke the specific versus the 

general canon, because the question at the end of the 

16 day is what did Congress intend? And where Congress 

17 enacts a specific remedial scheme that sets out the 

18 extent to which liability will be imposed under, in this 

19 case, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it stands to reason 

that Congress would have expected courts to look to the 

21 remedial scheme that it established to determine to 

22 metes and bounds of liability, not to some other general 

23 default provision. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Srinivasan --

MR. SRINIVASAN: And therefore in that 

17

1 sense, the specific remedial scheme that's in the 

2 statute should control over some other general scheme 

3 that Congress might well not have had in mind at all 

4 when it set forward the terms under which claims can be 

brought under FCRA. 

6  JUSTICE KAGAN: How specific does the other 

7 statute have to be? Suppose there were another statute 

8 that just said any party can bring suits to enforce any 

9 rights against any persons under this statute. 

Would you be making the same argument? 

11  MR. SRINIVASAN: If -- if the statute were 

12 that general? 

13  JUSTICE KAGAN: Yes. If that's all the 

14 statute says. It just says any party can bring suit to 

enforce rights under this statute. So there’s not a 

16 lot of hoopla and a lot of detail about a remedial 

17 scheme. Would you still say that -- this controls over 

18 the Tucker Act? 

19  MR. SRINIVASAN: I think I would, because I 

think in that context, Congress would have made a 

21 determination on the scope of liability for claims under 

22 that statute. It would have given thought to that 

23 issue, and it would have set forth in a very general 

24 provision the metes and bounds of the liability. And 

Congress I think in that context wouldn't have expected

1 anyone to look to the Tucker Act, because Congress gave 

2 no indication that it was thinking about the Tucker Act. 

3  Now, in Your Honor's hypothetical, if you 

4 had a statute that spoke in those kinds of general 

terms, of course, we'd have I think a very good argument 

6 that there would have been no contemplation of a waiver 

7 of sovereign immunity. So we would strongly resist the 

8 notion that the United States might fall within the 

9 compass of that general provision. 

But on the question of whether you'd look to 

11 that general provision as opposed to the Tucker Act, I 

12 think you would look to that general provision, because 

13 Congress in the context of enacting that statute told 

14 everybody: We're defining the extent to which liability 

can be asserted in court by reference to this general 

16 provision; this is where you ought to look, not 

17 somewhere else. 

18  Now, one other --

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: Isn't it really -- doesn't 

the question come down to as you're putting it 

21 whether -- whether the Tucker Act eliminates for all 

22 other statutes the presumption against liability on the 

23 part of the United States? 

24  MR. SRINIVASAN: It does. I think it does. 

And I think that's quite a breathtaking proposition, and

3  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, then it's 

4 really the specific governing the general, but the other 

way around, right? The Tucker Act discusses 

6 specifically the liability and the sovereign immunity of 

7 the United States, and if the statute just generally 

8 doesn't address it, then the Tucker Act is the specific 

9 one and the other statute is the general one. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it would be hard to 

11 square that understanding with the way -- with the 

12 series of this Court's cases that apply the specific 

13 versus general canon, because I think the same argument 

14 could have been made in Brown v. General Services 

Administration, in Erika, in Hinck, that if you thought 

16 that the subject --

17  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You'd win under this 

18 argument, too, right? 

19  MR. SRINIVASAN: I'm sorry? 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You win under this 

21 argument, too. It just seems to me that it's not quite 

22 right to say that FCRA -- FCRA does not specifically 

23 address the liability of the United States. 

24  MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The Tucker Act does.

1 So the Tucker Act is the one that's specific, and it 

2 applies instead of the general language in the -- in 

3 FCRA. 

4  MR. SRINIVASAN: It -- well, you can look at 

5 it that way, Mr. Chief Justice, but I guess my only 

6 response --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: 

8 lose, not win. 

9  MR. SRINIVASAN: 

10 because it depends on --

11  JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12  MR. SRINIVASAN: 

13 construe the Tucker Act. 

In which case you would 

Well, that's the question 

Yes – you better resist it. 

-- it depends on how you 

14  I mean, I think Your Honor is correctly 

15 construing the Tucker Act's waiver of sovereign immunity 

16 only to apply to a certain limited subset of acts of 

17 Congress. And if you construed it in a sufficiently 

18 limited way, I suppose we could live with that result. 

19  But I think the better way to approach the 

20 question is to look at the particular remedial scheme 

21 that Congress enacted in the scope of the statute 

22 itself. And for purposes of questions of sovereign 

23 immunity, you'd look to that particular remedial scheme 

24 and ask the age-old question, countenanced by this

1 Court's decisions, of whether there is an unequivocal --

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: So what is covered by the 

Tucker Act? I mean, every -- every basis for suit 

6 against the Government, every claim that the Government 

7 owes you money rests upon some statutory text, doesn't 

8 it? 

9  MR. SRINIVASAN: There -- well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: So what --

11  MR. SRINIVASAN: -- not claims in contract, 

12 for example. Obviously, if there is an expressed 

13 contract with the United States, I don't know that that 

14 comes under a statute, necessarily, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. Express contracts 

16 with the United States. Anything else? 

17  MR. SRINIVASAN: The just compensation 

18 clause. That doesn't come under a statute, it comes 

19 under the Constitution, but the Tucker Act can be used. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. But anything that 

21 comes under a statute, you would look to the other 

22 statute to see whether there is sovereign immunity under 

23 that statute; and, if there is under that statute, then 

24 the Tucker Act does not overcome it. 

MR. SRINIVASAN: If that statute -- at least

1 if that statute has its own remedial scheme, then you'd 

2 look to the remedial scheme in that statute. 

3  But I think this is where I started off with 

4 Justice Sotomayor. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's exactly what I 

6 started with. That's what I started with: Is there 

7 anything left to the Tucker Act? 

8  MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. And I think there 

9 is. I think the -- statutes like the one that this 

Court had before it in White Mountain Apache Tribe are 

11 ones. 

12  Another example that I could give the Court 

13 is there is a statute that dealt with payment of 

14 compensation to prisoners of war. This was the statute 

that was at issue in Bell v. The United States. I think 

16 it's cited in footnote 42 of the Court's opinion in 

17 Bowen v. Massachusetts. 

18  But that statute specifically set forth that 

19 compensation would be owed to prison -- prisoners of war 

held in captivity. That statute did not have its own 

21 remedial scheme. Its substantive obligation ran against 

22 the United States, and the United States alone, by 

23 nature. 

24  And the Tucker Act, I think, in that context 

would step in to supply a waiver of sovereign immunity

1 and jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims. And 

2 the reason is that that statute has the two predicate 

3 conditions that we think have to be met in order to even 

4 raise the question whether the Tucker Act steps in. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So the new rule is if a 

6 statute is written to impose obligations only on the 

7 Government, then the Tucker Act is implicated 

8 immediately. If the rule says the Government and any 

9 party who contracts with it -- a Medicaid provider --

must do X, Y, and Z, and the Government and the Medicaid 

11 provider have the burdens of accomplishing Y, unless 

12 there is an express waiver of sovereign immunity, the 

13 Tucker Act doesn't come into play. 

14  MR. SRINIVASAN: I think that's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's your position. 

16  MR. SRINIVASAN: I think that's right, Your 

17 Honor, but I'd qualify it in one respect, which is that 

18 if -- if the statute contains its own remedial scheme, 

19 that's an independent reason for not looking at the 

Tucker Act. 

21  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you are not going 

22 to suggest that if the scheme I just described says X, 

23 Y, and Z, have to do all these things, and someone to 

24 whom they owe that obligation can sue the Medicaid 

provider, for example, for breach of that obligation,

1 presumably -- I'm putting in a lot of hypotheticals 

2 given our case law -- but you're saying they can't sue 

3 the Government under the Tucker Act --

4  MR. SRINIVASAN: Right. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- unless there is an 

6 express waiver. 

7  MR. SRINIVASAN: That's right. I think you 

8 would look to the question of whether there’s been a 

9 sufficiently expressed waiver in the terms of the 

statute itself, which is the traditional test that this 

11 Court has applied. 

12  JUSTICE KAGAN: How about if a statute has 

13 no remedial provision at all; it just lists a set of 

14 legal obligations, but it’s a generally applicable 

statute, it doesn't concern only the United States? 

16 Would your argument still apply that the Tucker Act has 

17 no force? 

18  MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, it would. I think 

19 it's easier where you have a remedial scheme, obviously, 

but I think it's also the case that where the 

21 substantive obligation is a generally applicable one and 

22 doesn't run against the United States alone, you'd 

23 still, I think, want to --

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: So then your argument really 

isn't about another statute having a remedial scheme.

Official 

1 In the briefs, you present it as another statute has a 

2 remedial scheme, of course you should look to that more 

3 particular remedial scheme. But you would take the 

4 argument and say, even if the other statute doesn't have 

a remedial scheme, we don't look to the Tucker Act; we 

6 just think of the Tucker Act as having a limitation that 

7 is not in the Tucker Act's test -- text in order to make 

8 the Tucker Act consistent with everything we thought we 

9 knew about principles of sovereign immunity? 

MR. SRINIVASAN: That's true. I mean, but I 

11 guess -- you don't have to reach the question of whether 

12 the Tucker Act applies or the statute doesn't have its 

13 own remedial scheme, obviously, in this case, because 

14 FCRA does have its own remedial scheme. Our argument 

would still apply. 

16  And on the question of whether we're reading 

17 the Tucker Act in one particular way to a subsets of 

18 acts of Congress, I guess one point I'd make is that the 

19 money mandating test that this Court has always applied 

where the Tucker Act does apply already presupposes that 

21 it doesn't apply to just any act of Congress, because 

22 the act of Congress has to be a money-mandating one. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: Say it again. I lost it. 

24 Give me the last sentence again.

1 thought at least -- maybe I should try to rephrase it, 

2 but the last thought is that this Court's jurisprudence 

3 already presupposes that the Tucker Act doesn't apply to 

4 every act of Congress because the Court's jurisprudence 

requires that the act of Congress be money-mandated. 

6  So we’re already in a zone in which the 

7 Tucker Act's reference to acts of Congress doesn't 

8 literally extend to every conceivable act of Congress. 

9 It only extends to certain acts of Congress. And I --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: But is this a 

11 money-mandated statute? 

12  MR. SRINIVASAN: I -- if you didn't 

13 have -- that's -- that's -- I guess -- if you didn't 

14 have the remedial scheme. 

We don't get to that question, 

16 Justice Kennedy, because you only get to the 

17 money-mandating question if there is not a remedial 

18 scheme in the text of the statute itself and the 

19 substantive obligation runs against the United States, 

and the United States alone, which this one doesn't 

21 because it's generally applicable. 

22  And it's hard to conceive of that question 

23 in the abstract because the question is whether the 

24 statute is money-mandating in that it specifically 

contemplates the payment of money by the United States;

1 and, precisely because the statute is generally 

2 applicable, I think we would say that under this statute 

3 it's not money-mandating, because it's not 

4 money-mandating in that it doesn't contemplate payment 

by the United States with relevant specificity because 

6 the substantive obligation is generally applicable. 

7  You only get to that question in a context 

8 like White Mountain Apache Tribe or Mitchell II, where 

9 the substantive obligation runs against the United 

States, and the United States alone, and where there’s 

11 no remedial scheme embedded within the statute itself. 

12 And then you ask the question whether is that kind of 

13 substantive obligation that runs against the United 

14 States, is that one that's naturally conceived as a 

money-mandating. 

16  And on that, I think you would look at a 

17 couple of considerations consistent with this Court's 

18 decisions. One is, is the obligation one that 

19 necessarily deals with compensation? So, for example, 

the statute I was referring to earlier that has to do 

21 with compensation for -- for imprisoned prisoners of 

22 war, that one naturally has to do with compensation, so 

23 it might be money-mandating.

1 Court concluded that because background principles of

4  But the principal point here --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, this sort of 

6 begs the question --

7  MR. SRINIVASAN: -- is you only get to that 

8 question if you get past that hurdle. 

9  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- the statute awards 

damages for breach of the obligation, so it's 

11 money-mandating. The issue is not whether it's 

12 money-mandating; the question is who’s it mandating. 

13  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, right, but --

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But there is not an 

issue of whether it contemplates the payment of damages. 

16 It expressly awards --

17  MR. SRINIVASAN: But I think the 

18 money-mandating test, Justice Sotomayor, is whether it 

19 contemplates the payment of damages by the 

United States. And I guess that's why I'm having a hard 

21 time addressing that question in the abstract, because 

22 there’s a predicate condition that hasn't been 

23 satisfied.

the substantive obligation runs against the

1 United States and the United States alone. I think 

2 precisely for the reason that Your Honor says, where the 

3 substantive obligation is generally applicable in that 

4 it applies to parties beyond the United States, it's 

hard to ask the question whether the statute is 

6 money-mandating in the relevant sense. 

7  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I -- it is -- there is 

8 some difficulty with your argument, which is, going back 

9 to my simplified hypothetical, Government and 

Medicaid -- X providers have to do X, Y, and Z; if those 

11 persons, being defined as Government and providers, 

12 doesn't do what they have to do, they have to pay these 

13 damages. 

14  MR. SRINIVASAN: That -- I will grant --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, that's pretty 

16 clear. 

17  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I will grant you, 

18 Justice Sotomayor, that that hypo is more difficult than 

19 this case because, although I would construe that to be 

generally applicable, it does talk about the Government. 

21 It specifically references the Government, and I think, 

22 by Your Honor's hypothetical, the United States alone. 

23 It's not an undifferentiated reference to persons, which 

24 is what you have in FCRA.

8  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. JACOBS 

9  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

MR. JACOBS: Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

11 please the Court: 

12  If I may, I should like to begin with 

13 Justice Kennedy's question: Is this a money-mandating 

14 statute? 

Section 1681(a) defines "persons" and it 

16 defines "persons" as, inter alia, "any Government or 

17 Government body or agency." That, it would seem to me, 

18 would be extraordinarily clear that the Government is 

19 subject to this act and subject to money-mandating. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, you wouldn't -- you 

21 wouldn't need the Tucker Act now, would you? 

22  MR. JACOBS: We --

2 Government is in fact covered, that would seem to me to 

3 be answered by 1681b(b)(4). 

4  JUSTICE SCALIA: So are you splitting your 

claim? I mean, if you have both a cause of action under 

6 FCRA and under the Tucker Act, the one has to go to the 

7 Federal Circuit and the other elsewhere, or the Court of 

8 Claims and then the Federal Circuit? What do you do? 

9  MR. JACOBS: Your Honor, that was -- that 

was the subject of some debate in the court below. We 

11 took the appeal to the Federal Circuit because the claim 

12 was based in whole or in part on the Tucker Act. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: You also claimed under 

14 FCRA, under the statute, right? 

MR. JACOBS: Yes, we do, Your Honor. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. 

17  JUSTICE BREYER: So why do you care? I 

18 mean, you're in the Northern District of Illinois, you 

19 bring a case under this Act. I guess you lost because 

you wanted to appeal. And so -- so what is the big 

21 deal? Appeal to the Seventh Circuit. Who cares. Why 

22 do you care which circuit you go to? You said you 

23 think -- well, why do you care?

argument is if you go to the Seventh Circuit, you don't 

21 get any money, right? Because if you're getting money 

22 from the United States, don't you have to go to the 

23 Court of Claims in a case like this?

3 competent jurisdiction. And in that regard, there's 

4 been a lot of talk about the remedial scheme, and with 

respect, Your Honor, I would submit that this is -- this 

6 is not some reticulated, remedial scheme where you have 

7 to file a claim and have a hearing and those kinds of 

8 things where this Court has enforced that against 

9 people. 

Here, it's just a typical statute that says 

11 you have to do A, B, and C, and if you don't you can be 

12 sued in Federal court. 

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you know any other 

14 statutes offhand -- I can't think of any, but maybe you 

know some -- in which you can get money out of the 

16 United States but don't have to go through the Court of 

17 Claims and the Federal circuit? What other statutes are 

18 there? And if there are none, the reason I ask the 

19 question, it becomes less and less plausible that FCRA 

was meant to allow suit against the Federal Government. 

21  MR. JACOBS: The Privacy Act, Your Honor, 

22 allows you to sue the Government in the district court. 

23  JUSTICE SCALIA: For money damages. 

24  MR. JACOBS: I believe so, Your Honor.

2 what you are saying is there's a statute that says you 

3 can't print more than the last five digits of a card or 

4 the date, the expiration date, and they did both and you 

want to say "or" means one or the other, it doesn't mean 

6 and/or. That's what the case is about fundamentally, 

7 right? 

8  MR. JACOBS: The case is about printing the 

9 expiration date, Your Honor. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Yes, can you do and/or or 

11 or. All right, got it. Now, if you print -- in your 

12 view of it, they printed too much about a person's 

13 credit card. 

14  MR. JACOBS: Yes. 

JUSTICE BREYER: It sounds like an -- sort 

16 of like an invasion of privacy, which is normally a 

17 tort. 

18  MR. JACOBS: It is like it, but I believe 

19 this Court's jurisprudence has been for a long while 

now, at least since Jacobs and I would submit even 

21 earlier, Dooley onward, that it doesn't make any 

22 difference whether -- if you're suing under a statute of 

23 the United States or a contract or anything else, if 

24 there's any element of tort in it, it doesn't matter.

4 claim -- I don't know this law; I'm asking, I'm not 

arguing. The plaintiff sues the United States for 

6 assault. And you're saying that they can bring that in 

7 the Court of Claims because it's a statute. 

8  I don't know how this law works. I just 

9 read that and I know the language doesn't totally tell 

you. It's about liquid, illiquid. I didn't get that 

11 part exactly. But as I've understood it, you can't 

12 bring a tort suit in the Court of Claims. Now, that's 

13 what I would like you to elaborate, because this sounds 

14 rather like a tort suit, not sort of. That's why I am 

asking. 

16  MR. JACOBS: As no doubt intended, Your 

17 Honor posed a very difficult question. I would submit 

18 that if the statute says that you may not do A, B, and 

19 C, that you could then sue in the Court of Claims. 

JUSTICE BREYER: Even if it says you may not 

21 assault someone. 

22  MR. JACOBS: Yes. Even though

3  MR. JACOBS: I think Daly -- Dooley, I 

4 think, Your Honor, in 1901 said: "Regardless of whether 

the exactions of taxes were tortious or not, we think 

6 this case is within one of the first class of cases 

7 specified in the Tucker Act of claims based upon a law 

8 of Congress." 

9  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But your argument --

your answer is a little more complicated, because the 

11 statute doesn't say tort claims, it says claims sounding 

12 in tort, which means cases that aren't torts, but are 

13 like torts. And it seems to me the case you -- you --

14 you have here is like tort, an invasion of privacy or 

something like that. 

16  MR. JACOBS: Your Honor, I believe, again, 

17 that this Court has not interpreted the cases that way. 

18 There is a debate as to whether a breach of fiduciary 

19 duty is a tort or something else, and yet this Court in 

White Mountain and other cases has -- has not found that 

21 to be a bar. 

22  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, your friend

MR. JACOBS: I'm sorry. 

6  JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- whether you think 

7 Congress ever honed in on the issue whether the United 

8 States, given the multitude of financial transactions in 

9 which it engages, ever thought that sovereign immunity 

would be waived? I mean, if you're right about this, 

11 the consequences are enormous for the Federal fisc. And 

12 we -- the -- the statute developed in a peculiar way. 

13  First, there was the definition of person 

14 when there was no civil liability, and then some years 

later the prohibition of having both the credit card 

16 number and the expiration date. In all of it, is there 

17 any hint that Congress envisioned a waiver of sovereign 

18 immunity in the Fair Credit Reporting Act? 

19  MR. JACOBS: Your Honor, I would submit yes, 

there is no explicit -- to my knowledge, there is no 

21 explicit reference in the Congressional Record to 

22 whether this was going to impact the Government or not.

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: For the same reason that 

8 you have the principle of sovereign immunity. They're 

9 -- they are perfectly willing to subject corporations to 

immense liability, but they are not willing to subject 

11 the Federal Government to immense liability. That's 

12 what the doctrine of sovereign immunity is all about, 

13 isn't it? 

14  MR. JACOBS: That's exactly correct, 

Your Honor. But that's why I said in terms of 

16 protecting the public, you wouldn't want to exclude such 

17 a large -- such a large thing. 

18  And when they wanted to protect the 

19 Government, as they did in 1681(b)(b)(4), when they 

wanted to exclude them, they explicitly did so --

21  JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Jacobs --

22  MR. JACOBS: -- the next year. 

23  JUSTICE KAGAN: -- the -- the import of the 

24 Government's argument is that if your interpretation

1 change in the law of sovereign immunity as we've known 

2 it until this time. 

3  So I will give you an -- Congress decides to 

4 pass a statute, and the statute has a cause of action in 

it. And the drafters say to each other, do we have to 

6 say that the Government retains sovereign immunity? And 

7 everybody says, no, the rules are that if we say nothing 

8 at all, the Government does retain sovereign immunity. 

9  Now, under your world, the next time 

Congress passes such a statute and that question comes 

11 up, you would say, oh, we have to say that the 

12 Government waives -- retains its sovereign immunity, 

13 because if we don't say that, somebody's going to bring 

14 an action under the Tucker Act. 

So for every statute, both the ones that 

16 have been written under the old rules and the new ones 

17 to come, we have completely flipped the presumption. 

18 Now, Congress is going to have to say when it wants to 

19 retain sovereign immunity, and if it doesn't -- if it 

doesn't, the Tucker Act applies, and you get to be in 

21 court. 

22  MR. JACOBS: With respect, Justice Kagan, I 

23 don't think that's true at all. They went out of their 

24 way to define person to include the Government. And 

that's significant in this respect, Your Honor. We cite

4  JUSTICE KAGAN: I don't think that quite 

answers the question. That's a -- that's a question 

6 about what FCRA means and whether under any standard, 

7 whether the fairly arguable standard or the express 

8 standard, you should win. And that's a different 

9 question. 

The question is what standard are we going 

11 to hold you to. Are we going to say, all you need to 

12 show is that it's fairly arguable, or are we going to 

13 say, no, unless there's an express statement that the 

14 Government has waived its sovereign immunity, the 

Government retains it? 

16  And as to that, you're asking us to flip the 

17 presumption from now on. 

18  MR. JACOBS: I don't believe so, Your Honor. 

19 I think they went out of their way to say this applies. 

It's not some general statute that says if a credit card 

21 is printed improperly. 

22  JUSTICE GINSBURG: When the definition of 

23 persons was put into the statute, there was no civil 

24 liability; isn't that right? So they didn't -- they 

could not have been thinking about civil liability.

Official 

1  MR. JACOBS: Well, when they amended FCRA in 

2 1996 to add the -- to change the word from credit 

3 reporting agency to person, I would submit that had to 

4 be a conscious step. 

And proof of that is found, I think, in two 

6 subsequent amendments. One, the next year, 

7 1681(b)(b)(4), saying, but this does not apply to the 

8 Government if there is a national security issue. And 

9 then the Government pointed to 1681(u)(i), that talked 

about if the FBI improperly disclosed information, what 

11 liability it would have. 

12  Now, in the appendix to the Government's 

13 brief, it stops there. But in the Government's petition 

14 for cert at page 78a, it also has 1681(u)(l) which says 

any other provision of this section notwithstanding, 

16 people are limited to this remedy against the 

17 Government. Why would Congress say that if there were 

18 not other liability for Congress -- for the 

19 United States? 

So, I believe the -- Congress was about as 

21 clear as it could be that it knew this applied to the 

22 United States, and when it wanted to carve something 

23 out, it did so, twice.

MR. JACOBS: Yes, Your Honor. I believe 

6 that --

7  JUSTICE SCALIA: I mean, why anybody --

8 notwithstanding any other provision, the remedies and 

9 sanctions set forth in this section shall be the only 

judicial remedies and sanctions for violation of this 

11 section. 

12  MR. JACOBS: I believe, Your Honor, that --

13  JUSTICE SCALIA: Why -- why does that bear 

14 upon whether the United States is liable or not? 

MR. JACOBS: This (u) only applies to 

16 United States, the FBI. 1681(u) is explicitly passed 

17 with regard to the FBI getting information and 

18 improperly disclosing it. 

19  JUSTICE SCALIA: I see. 

MR. JACOBS: And this would say, 

21 notwithstanding any other provisions, and it wouldn't do 

22 that if there weren't other provisions applicable. 

23  And that, Your Honor, takes me back to the 

24 Moore case, which we discussed many times in our brief, 

a similarly, almost identical statute, the Equal Credit

1 Opportunity Act. 

2  The Truth in Lending Act, the equal 

3 opportunity -- the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and FCRA 

4 were all part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 

different parts of it. And the Equal Credit Opportunity 

6 Act had the same, almost the same definition with one 

7 word different of importance. 

8  And then the -- the Fifth Circuit said, 

9 there is no exception in here, once it says that, for 

any person -- it doesn't have an exception for the 

11 United States, unlike the Truth in Lending Act which had 

12 a specific provision exempting the United States. 

13  This is identical except for one word 

14 different. This says any, the most emphatic word it 

could use. The other two statutes say, a Government or 

16 Government entity. This statute says, any Government or 

17 Government entity. 

18  And the United States makes no response to 

19 that interpretation that is throughout our judicial 

system. And, indeed, it would be difficult to because 

21 throughout the United States now, the -- the United 

22 States no longer even attempts to argue that ECOA does 

23 not provide for waiver of sovereign immunity.

much new law, Your Honor --

6  JUSTICE SCALIA: Yes. 

7  MR. JACOBS: -- because I believe this is 

8 consistent with this Court's longstanding jurisprudence. 

9  And, indeed, the -- the cases where the 

Court says, no, we're not going to let you bring this 

11 under the Tucker Act, is where the party is trying to 

12 escape, to get around a limitation in the substantive 

13 act, where they're trying to avoid a statute of 

14 limitations, avoid the requirement to file a -- a claim, 

as in Elkhorn Mining, as -- to get around -- get away 

16 from a court as in Hinck, where it says the tax court 

17 will have jurisdiction of this. And then they are 

18 trying to get around --

19  That's not going on here. We're -- the 

Plaintiff in this case is not trying to evade any

22 And the Government points to nothing -- no violence that 

23 would be done to the FCRA by allowing this.

passed was to protect consumers. The Congress was clear

4  And, Justice Scalia, you asked, well, would 

we just win under the -- under the statute? My answer 

6 to that would be unequivocally yes, we should. It's an 

7 unequivocal waiver. 

8  And that's the irony here. I think you have 

9 a -- a more unequivocal waiver in this statute than you 

do almost any other where the Court has found that yeah, 

11 that's a fair inference of a money-mandating situation. 

12  JUSTICE BREYER: Well, I mean, the -- a lot 

13 of these provisions are technical, like the one I think 

14 is fairly technical, the one you are talking about, the 

Government -- it provides for treble damages -- treble 

16 damages, does it? 

17  MR. JACOBS: Yeah. 

18  JUSTICE BREYER: Minimum damage, punitive 

19 damages, a fairly lengthy statute of limitations 

compared to the court of claims.

1  JUSTICE BREYER: My -- my impression was 

2 there are several differences. And normally, these 

3 things you, at least arguably, are not appropriate 

4 against the Government, because the Government when it 

knows the law will follow it, we hope. And, therefore, 

6 you don't need brow-beating mechanisms to make sure they 

7 follow it once it's clarified. So, therefore, it -- I 

8 mean, I can imagine arguments. 

9  At the same time, there are differences 

between the relief scheme in this statute and the normal 

11 one you have in the Court of Claims. And they're 

12 arguing that that means that they didn't want this 

13 Tucker Act and these other things to apply. 

14  I just want to know what your reply is to 

that. They are different. 

16  MR. JACOBS: They -- they are different,

18 saying, this is what you must do, and if you don't do, 

19 this is what you have to pay -- I see nothing unusual 

about saying that can be in the Court of Claims; that 

21 that's a Tucker Act claim. That doesn't seem -- that's

ad hoc. In other words, they don't fit quite together, 

16 and your answer is: Well, we'll just take whatever, you 

17 know, whatever we have to, to make it fit. It would go 

18 under the least imposing on the Government. 

19  It suggests that Congress did not expect the 

Tucker Act to apply if you've got to change the remedial

1  This Court has consistently said, as Your 

2 Honor said, that the Tucker Act only provides an outer 

3 limit for filing, but we'll use the shorter time period. 

4 In Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto, the Court said: No, no, no, 

you've got -- because Monsanto didn't want there to be a 

6 Tucker Act claim. It wanted to be able to argue: We 

7 have no relief available to us for having to disclose 

8 the components of our insecticides. And they wanted to 

9 argue: There is no relief available to us. 

And this Court said: No, you've got a --

11 you've got a Tucker Act claim. You do have relief 

12 available to you. And the Court said: Yeah, you didn't 

13 file a claim. There is a procedure where you could file 

14 a -- a claim saying: This is a trade secret, and the --

you then would have arbitration. And the Court said: 

16 You haven't done that; go ahead and do that and then 

17 let's see what happens. But you've got a Tucker Act 

18 claim. 

19  And incidentally, in that regard, in 

Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto, the Court discussed extensively 

21 the Restatement of Torts as to whether a trade secret --

22 a listed trade secret under the Restatement of Torts, 

23 and then went ahead and said: No. You've got a Tucker

2 waives sovereign immunity, so we don't have to worry 

3 about whether the standard is a weak standard or a tough 

4 standard, doesn't matter. We win anyway. 

MR. JACOBS: Absolutely. 

6  JUSTICE BREYER: So what you want us to say 

7 is, okay. We will apply the tough standard. There's 

8 still -- there's still -- sovereign immunity is waived 

9 in FCRA. And since sovereign immunity is clearly waived 

there, then you can bring this under the Tucker Act, and 

11 the only differences are the remedial schemes are 

12 slightly different, but that doesn't matter. 

13  Am I correctly stating what you are now 

14 telling us? 

MR. JACOBS: I'm telling Your Honor that we 

16 win under such a test. We don't believe such a test is 

17 called for, but if -- if such a test were used, we still 

18 win because you do have such a clear waiver. 

19  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: One of the purposes of 

the Tucker Act was to provide a remedy, where none 

21 existed, to get rid of the private bills. What's wrong 

22 with the Government's basic proposition which is where 

23 you have a remedy you have to pursue that remedy. And I 

24 think that, at bottom, that's their argument.

role the Tucker Act should play one that should be given 

6 voice? One that should be followed? 

7  MR. JACOBS: Your Honor, I would submit that 

8 that would be a substantial change in this Court's 

9 jurisprudence. Congress passed the Tucker Act, and this 

court, for years now, has said, "If you meet these 

11 requirements, you may sue under the Tucker Act." 

12  JUSTICE SCALIA: The Government doesn't 

13 concede that you have a cause of action under FCRA at 

14 all. 

MR. JACOBS: No. 

16  JUSTICE SCALIA: They say -- they say just 

17 the opposite. And so what I find peculiar is that there 

18 should be two causes of action for the same thing. You 

19 can proceed either under FCRA or under the Tucker Act or 

both. I mean, that's very strange to me. It seems to 

21 me, one or the other, and it would normally be the 

22 specific governing the general. 

23  So if you say there is one under FCRA, why 

24 do we need the Tucker Act?

4 to the Court of Appeals. But there is --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Do you have any other case 

6 where -- where you -- somebody's been allowed to proceed 

7 under the Tucker Act where there is clear ability to 

8 proceed under some other statute? 

9  MR. JACOBS: Your Honor, I cannot name you a 

case off the top of my head. As I said, I believe the 

11 Privacy Act allows you to do either. The -- all --

12  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The FSLA as well. 

13  MR. JACOBS: I'm sorry? 

14  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The FSLA as well. 

MR. JACOBS: Yes. The FSLA -- I was going 

16 to say, as Your Honor said earlier. But the cases 

17 where a Tucker Act remedy has been denied, as I've said, 

18 are where a person was trying to evade a limitation of 

19 the substantive act. That's not this case. This case 

is four-square within the court's jurisprudence. The 

21 Government argues now for a new -- and it's not clear to 

22 me exactly what test, but it's a limiting one. It 

23 would -- it would cut back the Tucker Act. 

24  JUSTICE KAGAN: But Mr. Jacobs, you are 

trying to evade a certain kind of limitation. The

1 limitation that you are trying to evade is the rule that 

2 waivers of sovereign immunity have to be express. And 

3 that's the rule you are trying to evade by going under 

4 the Tucker Act. 

MR. JACOBS: No, Your Honor. We believe, 

6 and we've maintained throughout, that we do have an 

7 express waiver, 1681(a) --

8  JUSTICE KAGAN: But then you wouldn't need 

9 to go under the Tucker Act. The difference between 

going under the Tucker Act and going under the statute 

11 is the difference between, you know, what -- what 

12 standard is a court going to hold you to, to decide 

13 whether there has been a waiver of sovereign immunity. 

14  MR. JACOBS: The standard, I would submit, 

Your Honor, is that the Tucker Act is always available 

16 unless a -- the substantive statute provides a 

17 limitation on that ability; either saying it shall be --

18 shall be litigated in the Tax Court, it can only be 

19 litigated if it is preceded by a claim, an 

administrative claim, some limitation like that. If --

21 if there's something that says it has to be in another 

22 forum, then you would be evading it. But otherwise, the 

23 Tucker Act remedy is available and it's appropriate and

it? FSLA was the other one? 

6  MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, FLSA is a bit 

7 complicated, for the reasons I was adverting to earlier. 

8 It's -- this Court has never confronted the question of 

9 how exactly you go forward under the FLSA. And I think, 

because of the ambiguity in the courts to which the FLSA 

11 refers, for the reasons I was discussing with Justice 

12 Sotomayor earlier, I think you could see that statute as 

13 incorporating the Tucker Act itself, but that would be 

14 something that Congress did. 

JUSTICE SCALIA: What about (u)(l), that 

16 your friend raised? 

17  MR. SRINIVASAN: (u)(i). I think there's 

18 several answers to (u)(i). First of all, I'm not sure 

19 which way that cuts because the fact -- it may be 

(u)(l), it may be (u)(i), but (u) -- I'm not sure which 

21 way that cuts because, on one hand, the fact that 

22 Congress specifically provided for the United States to 

23 be liable in certain situations I think cuts in favor of 

24 our understanding, not against it. 

But there's a more fundamental point about 

55

25

Official 

1 the argument that my friend makes on the other side, 

2 which is that that statute was enacted, I think, before 

3 the civil remedies provisions were expanded to encompass 

4 all persons. So it's hard to conclude that that 

notwithstanding any other provision would have referred 

6 to something that came along later. 

7  Now, I have two points that I'd like to make 

8 in rebuttal, one of which, there's been some questions 

9 today about which is the specific statute and which is 

the general statute. 

11  Now, one, I think, clear indication that the 

12 specific statute for present purposes should be FCRA is 

13 to look at what the Plaintiffs allege. 

14  The Plaintiffs are bringing a FCRA claim, 

and there's no mistake about that, because the 

16 Plaintiffs seek the FCRA advantage of statutory damages 

17 of at least $100. And so they're grounding their claim 

18 in the FCRA cause of action. And I think, therefore, 

19 you should look at FCRA to determine whether the 

Government is liable. 

21  And you don't have a situation in which you 

22 can mix and match under both; you should look to FCRA to 

23 determine whether there's been a clear and express 

24 waiver of sovereign immunity. 

The other point I would like to discuss is

3 some universe in which you could contemplate a 

4 hybridization where you apply the Tucker Act, even 

though there's a cause of action already in the statute, 

6 you wouldn't do so in the context of this case because 

7 there are clear indications that Congress wouldn't have 

8 contemplated a resort to the Tucker Act. 

9  The Tucker Act doesn't apply to torts. This 

claim is a tort claim. We know this because the Court 

11 in Safeco a few terms ago -- this is at 551 U.S. 69 --

12 specifically referred to the Restatement of Torts as a 

13 means of -- interpreting the term willfulness, which is
