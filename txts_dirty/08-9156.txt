 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: We will hear 

argument next in Case 08-9156, Wood v. Allen.

 Mr. Scanlon.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KERRY A. SCANLON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SCANLON: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Holly Wood was sentenced to death after his 

lawyers failed to investigate or present to the jury 

evidence of his undisputed mental deficiencies. That 

evidence was readily available to any reasonably 

competent attorney, and it offered powerful mitigation 

which had a reasonable probability of changing the 

sentence from death to life without parole.

 No one on the sentencing jury had any idea 

that Mr. Wood had any mental deficiency, much less that 

he had an IQ between 59 and 64, which means he ranks in 

the lowest one percent of the total population.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course, if they had 

introduced that evidence on behalf of the defendant, 

there would have come in the report they had gotten 

from -- who was it, Dr. Kirkland? Was that his name?

 MR. SCANLON: That's correct, Justice

Scalia.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Which said that, although 

he -- he indeed was in the lower range of mental 

agility, this did not affect his ability to discern 

right from wrong.

 MR. SCANLON: Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA: He was not -- the Kirkland 

report was not a favorable report for the defendant.

 MR. SCANLON: Well, the Kirkland report was 

not -- first of all, was only about his mental 

competency and whether he had a mental disease or defect 

that prevented him from knowing right from wrong. It 

was an incompetency and insanity report.

 This Court has made it clear in Atkins and 

other cases that mentally retarded persons often know 

the difference between right and wrong and are competent 

to stand trial. What that report did have is a very 

strong lead that he had a borderline intellectual 

functioning. That is different from whether or not he 

is able to go to trial or whether he --

JUSTICE SCALIA: Well, but it didn't just 

say borderline intellectual function. It went on to say 

that did not affect his ability to perceive that he 

was -- he was doing something wrong here.

 MR. SCANLON: Each of the statements --

JUSTICE SCALIA: You know, if it had not 

added that I would have said, oh, yeah, let's -- let's 

pursue this further. But they -- it seems to me they 

made an intelligent decision There was nothing here that 

was going to help them and there might be stuff that 

would hurt them.

 MR. SCANLON: Justice Scalia, everything in 

the Kirkland report that talked about his ability was 

his ability to go to trial, that he was competent and 

that he knew the difference between right and wrong. 

Those findings in the Kirkland report that talk about 

that relate only to that issue. It's an entirely 

different issue, which the courts have made clear, 

whether someone has significant mental deficiencies that 

will -- will -- is the kind of evidence that garners 

sympathy from the jury.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Why is this question 

properly before us in this case? The argument that you 

seem to be making, and it's an argument to which you 

devote a lot of your brief, seems to be that the -- the 

State courts unreasonably applied Strickland to the 

performance of the attorneys at the penalty phase.

 Now, that is a, a (d)(1) argument, 

2254(d)(1). But the two questions on which cert were 

granted have to do with findings of fact. So they have

to do with (d)(2) and (e)(1) and not (d)(1) at all.

 MR. SCANLON: Justice Alito, our primary 

argument is a (d)(2) argument, and that is that there 

was no strategic decision here, that in fact it was a 

failure to investigate in violation of this Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Was (d)(2) raised in 

your habeas petition?

 MR. SCANLON: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Could you give me a 

citation for that, where in the habeas petition you made 

a (d)(2) claim as opposed to a (d)(1) claim?

 MR. SCANLON: Well, our habeas -- I -- I can 

get a cite for that, but our habeas petition was all 

about failing to do an investigation in the State 

court's findings that there had been a reasonable 

investigation. The State court finding, Mr. Chief 

Justice, is at page 201a and 202a of the petition 

appendix.

 And at that point the State courts talk 

about eight historical facts and they conclude that 

there was a reasonable investigation of the facts.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That factual 

determination that you say is unreasonable under (d)(2), 

that went to deficient performance?

 MR. SCANLON: That went to deficient

performance, of course.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Did the -- did the 

State court make a ruling on prejudice under Strickland?

 MR. SCANLON: The State court did make a 

ruling on prejudice. And it made it on two grounds: It 

found that he was not mentally retarded, which, of 

course, is -- is -- is clearly unreasonable, because you 

don't have to be mentally retarded to have it be 

valuable evidence to present to the jury.

 Secondly, they -- they found that the crime 

was brutal in its nature, even though the trial court 

had -- had -- had declined to give the instruction that 

it was cruel and heinous.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you agree that we 

have to find that it was an unreasonable determination 

both with respect to performance and with respect to 

prejudice to get you through the (d)(2) hurdle?

 MR. SCANLON: Yes, of course, and I think we 

can do that, and for the same reason, Mr. Chief Justice, 

that it was not reasonable in the first place for 

counsel to decide to stop their investigation. That's 

because the evidence is so powerful. This is the most 

powerful kind of mitigating evidence you can have in 

this type of case.

Justice Alito's question? As I read the lower court 

decision, it was saying counsel made a strategic choice 

not to pursue any further investigation with respect to 

mental health, correct?

 MR. SCANLON: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. And they 

made it on the basis of a number of factors, including 

the fact that there was testimony that the two senior 

attorneys said: It's not going to help us if we do or 

not. You may disagree with whether or not a strategic 

decision was made or not, but if one can view the 

evidence in any way as the attorney having made the 

decision, isn't your argument that that decision was 

unreasonable?

 MR. SCANLON: Of course.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But isn't that what 

Justice Alito asked you? That's not a dispute with the 

factual finding that it was a strategic decision. 

That's a dispute with the legal -- the legal -- whether 

that strategic decision met the legal standard of 

Strickland.

 MR. SCANLON: That's correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So we're 

back to Justice Alito's question, which is, isn't that a 

(d)(1) instead of a (d)(2) argument, and we -- the

question presented only addressed the strategic 

decision. It didn't address or present the question of 

the Strickland question of whether that would have been 

a reasonable strategic decision.

 MR. SCANLON: Your Honor, that is our 

alternative argument. Our -- our main argument is a 

(d)(2) argument.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It might be your 

alternative argument, but it's not the question 

presented.

 MR. SCANLON: No, I'm saying the fact 

question is our primary argument. That is how we lost 

in the Eleventh Circuit. The Eleventh Circuit made a 

determination that it was not unreasonable to find that 

there had been an adequate investigation by these 

lawyers of a mental health defense. That's what the 

Eleventh Circuit found.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: When did that come up? I 

thought that the facts as the Eleventh Circuit presented 

them is that the senior lawyer first said: We want 

Dr. Kirkland's report not simply on the question of 

insanity and incompetence to stand trial, but also to 

give us leads to mitigating evidence.

 So mitigation is in his mind about looking 

into this mental question. He reads Kirkland's report

and, for whatever reason, decides this isn't worth 

pursuing; this is not going to help us.

 I thought that that's what the Eleventh 

Circuit said was the picture, that whether it was an 

incompetent, ineffective decision is a separate 

question, but as to what happened, why did the 

investigation stop, because the senior lawyer said: 

Yes, it's relevant to mitigation, but I looked at the 

report and I think it's not wise for us to pursue 

mitigation.

 MR. SCANLON: Justice Ginsburg, that is what 

the State argues. That is not what the Eleventh Circuit 

found. On pages 56 and 57a of the petition appendix, 

the Eleventh Circuit clearly makes a finding that there 

had been a reasonable investigation done of this.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Where is that? 56?

 MR. SCANLON: Page 56a and page 57a of the 

petition appendix, which is the Eleventh Circuit 

decision. And if you look at page 56a, for example, the 

Eleventh Circuit framed the issue correctly. They say: 

Here the issue becomes, did counsel, before deciding not 

to present evidence of Wood's borderline intellectual 

function make reasonable investigation or a reasonable 

decision that made particular investigations 

unnecessary?

And they go on right after that on page 56 

and 57 to say that they did a reasonable investigation. 

They cite eight historical facts about that 

investigation. Those facts are objectively --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm sorry that I don't 

have that appendix with me now, but as I recall the 

Eleventh Circuit was not making any independent 

determination of its own, but it was reporting what the 

senior lawyer -- his view of it. They were not making a 

fact-finding as a tribunal.

 MR. SCANLON: With all due respect, Justice 

Ginsburg, if you look at the Eleventh Circuit decision 

at this critical point, there is no reference to Mr. 

Dozier, who is the senior lawyer. What the reference is 

to are the State court findings, which they say at 57a 

are amply supported by the record. Those findings were 

that they did an investigation, that it was adequate, 

and in fact, the State has now abandoned that position.

 The State no longer claims that these 

lawyers did any investigation at all. They claim that 

they looked at the Kirkland report and made a decision 

then and there to terminate any investigation, and that 

-- that of course would be a violation under (d)(1). 

But you first have to get to the fact issue, whether 

they did an investigation in the first place.

JUSTICE KENNEDY: You don't have the cite 

for 542 F.3d, that part of the opinion? It's in 

542 F.3d, 1281, but I don't have the particular page. 

Okay.

 MR. SCANLON: I'm sorry, I don't have the 

F.2d cite.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Could you clarify one --

could you clarify one thing for me?

 I understand that you can understand the 

record as indicating that they made a reasonable 

strategic decision not to let that report come in or 

make these arguments at the guilt stage, but the 

separate question is whether, did they also decide, make 

the same decision with respect to the penalty phase? 

And if they did, were they assuming that the Kirkland 

report would become a part of the record at the penalty 

stage as it would have at the guilt stage if it came in?

 MR. SCANLON: Well, I think your question is 

-- is right on point, because what Mr. Dozier was 

thinking about when he said it didn't merit further 

inquiry was the guilt phase.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Right.

 MR. SCANLON: That's what he was focused on. 

He -- he designated to Mr. Trotter, the junior lawyer, 

the penalty phase, and therefore the fact that they

didn't make that decision is clear, because two months 

later Mr. Dozier himself is going to the trial court 

with Mr. Trotter and asking for psychological 

evaluations and other reports.

 Mr. Trotter, before the trial, says: Your 

Honor, we have not investigated this; it needs further 

assessment. So clearly --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That, what you said so 

far, leaves out one thing; that is, I thought that 

Dozier had said: We need, we have to get this Kirkland 

report, and it's of interest to us for three purposes, 

the two that were relevant to the guilt phase and the 

one, mitigation, that was relevant to the penalty phase.

 That suggests that in his mind, in Dozier's 

mind from the start, was both phases, the guilt phase 

and with respect to mitigation. And then he looked in 

the report and, having said, we should see if there's 

any leads to mitigation, then he next says, we're not 

going forward with this.

 MR. SCANLON: Well, Justice Ginsburg, the --

what Mr. Dozier said at that time was in response to a 

leading question: Did you have the penalty phase in 

mind? And he said: Of course.

 Now, what he actually did when he requested 

the Kirkland report was to limit it specifically to

competency and insanity, and so -- but even if Mr. 

Dozier had that in mind, which I don't think the record 

supports -- let's assume that he had that in mind. When 

he got the Kirkland report, it's obvious the State 

agrees with it. This Court's precedents show that 

what's in the Kirkland report is an extremely strong 

lead. He has borderline mental functioning. And 

counsel were not able to simply not follow that lead. 

Reasonable counsel would have seen that as a green 

light, not a red light.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now this case, for me at 

least, is terribly confusing, because I thought, reading 

the cert position, that the Court granted cert to deal 

with a legal question that has confused the lower 

courts, that is, what is the relationship between (d)(2) 

and (e)(1) of AEDPA?

 MR. SCANLON: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Now I read your brief and 

I hear what you're saying so far. It seems to be that 

you have a solid case under (d)(1); that is, that these 

counsel were ineffective because they did not pursue 

mental state mitigation.

 But that would be a much different -- that 

would be a fact-bound case tied to this record, as apart 

from the legal question: What does unreasonable -- the

(d)(2) unreasonableness, how does it relate to the 

(e)(1) presumed correct, clear and convincing evidence? 

I thought that that legal question was why we granted 

cert.

 MR. SCANLON: And that is very central to 

this case, and the reason it's central is because the 

Eleventh Circuit got it wrong when they focused on 

individual fact-findings, many of which were immaterial 

to the claim, instead of looking at the entire State 

court record, and so we --

JUSTICE ALITO: But that's an entirely 

different question. I think that's the question. Did 

the validity of the -- the conclusion made by the State 

courts that there was a strategic decision not to 

present this evidence until the -- the final judge stage 

of the -- of the proceeding, and not whether there was a 

reasonable investigation or whether they -- there was 

reasonable performance overall at the penalty phase.

 It's purely this question of the validity of 

a finding of historical fact and how that is to be 

evaluated under -- under (d), under (d)(2) and (e)(1).

 MR. SCANLON: Right, and, if you look at 

Eleventh Circuit's opinion, the majority opinion in this 

case, what they did is, rather than look at the entire 

record for reasonableness to see if the Petitioner had

shown that it was not reasonable, what they did was they 

looked at individual fact-findings.

 And -- and they said that those are not 

rebutted by clear and convincing evidence; therefore, 

it's reasonable. And that's the mistake.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But let's just talk 

about the -- the finding of -- by the district court 

that there was no strategic reason and the -- and the 

disagreement with that in the Federal circuit, and let's 

talk about it just under (d)(1) -- just under (d)(1).

 MR. SCANLON: Okay.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Would you say that the 

test is whether or not the -- that finding was clearly 

erroneous?

 MR. SCANLON: No.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Is that -- is that another 

way?

 MR. SCANLON: No. I think the standard is 

much more difficult than that. I think the standard --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why -- why is 

"unreasonable application" different from "clearly 

erroneous"?

 MR. SCANLON: I think it's -- I think 

something could be incorrect, but it wouldn't be 

unreasonable. I think something could be erroneous, but

it wouldn't be unreasonable.

 I think that Congress made it clear that 

(d)(2) was a deferential standard. It has teeth in it.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I'm -- I'm talking 

about (d)(1).

 MR. SCANLON: Okay. Under (d)(1) --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: I-- I beg your -- (d)( 2), 

unreasonable determination of facts.

 MR. SCANLON: Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Yes.

 MR. SCANLON: Right. And that is that 

Congress said that a Petitioner has to show, before they 

can go anywhere in their case, that that is objectively 

unreasonable.

 In the prior version of this statute, it was 

much easier --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: So you -- you think there 

can be findings that are clearly erroneous, but not an 

unreasonable determination of facts?

 MR. SCANLON: I think that this Court, 

certainly, in the context of (d)(1) has said, in 

Miller-El, that there is a difference between something 

being erroneous and something being unreasonable.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm talking about (d)(2).

 MR. SCANLON: I think it would -- I think it

would apply there, too. I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Because the problem, as 

Justice Ginsburg indicated, is that the courts of 

appeals are looking for guidance as -- as to when we can 

go into -- into these findings and set them aside.

 MR. SCANLON: Right. Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: And it really is very 

difficult for me to wear a "clearly erroneous" hat or an 

"unreasonable determination of fact." I -- I just can't 

sense any difference there.

 MR. SCANLON: I -- I think the key 

difference is this, Justice Kennedy, and that is that 

when you have a "clearly erroneous" test -- or under --

under (e)(1), you're not looking at the entire factual 

record. You're looking at independent fact-findings. 

And that's where the Court got it wrong in this case. 

And what this Court needs to do is clarify several 

things. One, that (e)(1) does not mean and (d)(2) does 

not mean that you have to show unreasonableness by clear 

and convincing evidence. That's what the Court did in 

this case, and the Eleventh Circuit has done that in 

other cases.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Do I have it right, in your 

opinion, so far? I'm just interested in the 

relationship between (d) and (e), and as I read it, just

to look at the language, it seems to me, in the (d) 

case, we're talking about something that was decided on 

a record in a State court.

 And you -- you're the lawyer, trying to get 

the Federal judge to say, that's all wrong. You're 

going to say their facts are wrong, their fact-finding. 

So you say: Judge, that was unreasonable, you know, in 

light of the record. That's what you do under (d)(2)?

 MR. SCANLON: Correct.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Now, (e) is a different 

situation. (E) is a situation where, for some reason or 

other -- and there are a few -- you are having a new 

hearing in the Federal court.

 One reason for having such a hearing could 

be that there was a factual predicate that couldn't have 

been discovered and it's very important. So you're get 

into that Federal court hearing. And now, when you're 

in the Federal court hearing it turns out that in the 

earlier State court hearing there was a fact-finding 

that has something to do with this. It may be not so 

important, but it's over there and you want to get the 

judge to ignore it.

 So there you have to show what (d)(2) says. 

You have the burden of saying that that was an 

unreasonable fact-finding. That's what it says. Those

different words make -- seem sensible to me because the 

proceeding is different, and the way we talk about the 

proceedings is a little bit different. But as a 

practical reality, I guess they come to about the same 

thing.

 All right. Now, forgetting my last comment, 

have I got the first part right as you understand it?

 MR. SCANLON: I think that's right. If 

there's different evidence that's extrinsic to the State 

court record, that is looked at in the Federal 

evidentiary proceeding under --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And that's -- that's what 

the Ninth Circuit position developed by Judge Kozinski.

 MR. SCANLON: That --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: The only problem with 

that, it would shrink the province of (e)(1) very 

considerably, because overwhelmingly Federal habeas 

petitioners do not get evidentiary hearings in Federal 

court.

 So, if we accept the Ninth Circuit's view of 

it, then (e) -- (e)(1) applies to a rather small 

category of cases; i.e., cases in which there is an 

evidentiary hearing in the Federal habeas proceeding.

 MR. SCANLON: But, Justice Ginsburg, (d)(2) 

requires just as much deference, we believe, because of

the -- the need to show that it's objectively 

unreasonable, so --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I'm -- I'm not talking 

about (d)(2) now. We're talking about two provisions, 

trying to make sense how do they relate to each other.

 MR. SCANLON: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: And one very 

well-presented position is the Ninth Circuit's in Judge 

Kozinski's opinion. My only question is am I right to 

say that his view, which is your view, would leave very 

little work for (e)(1) to do if (e)(1) applies only when 

there's new evidence coming in; it's not just the -- the 

record that was made in the State court, but new 

evidence coming in in the Federal habeas.

 MR. SCANLON: There's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: There are not -- not many 

cases.

 MR. SCANLON: There's less -- there's less 

work to do, of course. It's ten percent of the cases or 

so, but no deference is lost because (e)(1) does not 

apply to the other 90 percent of the cases, because 

(d)(2), that standard itself --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: What you're saying is 

(d)(2) is a vigorous standard, but, yes, your 

description, unlike the opposing description of the

relationship between these two --

MR. SCANLON: Right.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- does leave for (e)(1) 

this maybe 10 percent of the cases, not more.

 MR. SCANLON: And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I go back to --

just to -- so that we're on the same page in my own 

mind, what constitutes the State record? Because one of 

the State amici posited situations in which the record 

before the State court on the issue that it made its 

determination would be one subset of evidence, and that, 

perhaps as the State process developed on another issue 

there was another record developed, and you're pointing 

to that evidence in your argument of unreasonableness as 

a reason for the lower court's decision being wrong.

 So your use of that other evidence, does 

that go under (d)(2) or (d)(1)?

 MR. SCANLON: The other evidence -- if it --

if it's intrinsic to the State court record, then it 

would be looked at under (d)(2), and the Petitioner 

would have to show that, looking at all of that 

evidence, the determination of fact was objectively 

unreasonable only if the evidence is outside of that. 

And -- and I think we agree, it's about ten percent of 

the cases, but that's not insignificant for the role

that (e)(1) plays.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Does that seem -- does 

that seem reasonable, meaning the State court is making 

a decision based on what's before it.  Can't -- it can't 

foretell unknown evidence and bring it into its 

equation. So one has to presume that its finding based 

on the evidence before it is correct.

 If there's additional evidence, whether it's 

part of a record that's developed elsewhere, not part of 

what it based its decision on, and if you look at the 

language of (d)(2), it talks about the record on the 

fact determined. It doesn't talk about on the --

MR. SCANLON: Yes. And any new evidence 

would be looked at under the clear and convincing 

standard, whether that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you're changing your 

earlier answer to me? You're going closer to what the 

amici were suggesting, which is that record has to be 

defined narrowly, it has to be the facts before the 

court?

 MR. SCANLON: No. I -- I understood your 

question to mean that the facts were part of a State 

court determination. It just wasn't the first one. 

There were two different determinations, but they were 

both in the State court proceeding.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm not sure I 

understand that, meaning often a trial court is 

presented with evidence that determines something. This 

was a strategic choice. It may be that later the State 

court has a hearing on that question, but it may be that 

it has a hearing on a different question altogether.

 MR. SCANLON: Right, but --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And you're using the 

evidence on the other question.

 MR. SCANLON: And if it's within the State 

court record, it is looked at under (d)(2).

 And if I may reserve the remainder of my 

time?

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Could I ask a question? 

Maybe you need a little extra time. I want to be sure I 

understand one thing. What is your view of what the 

unreasonable determination of facts was in this case, 

either the decision not to go forward with further 

investigation or that the results of the investigation 

would not have been -- would have been -- would have 

been prejudicial?

 MR. SCANLON: Well, those are both 

unreasonable determinations of fact. The first one, 

that they did an investigation, is what the Eleventh 

Circuit ruled. The State in this Court on the merits

decision because Kirkland report was a red light, we 

made a decision not to go forward. That is also

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF COREY L. MAZE

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 MR. MAZE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

 Based on the Court's questioning so far, I 

believe that I, as did every amicus, believe the 

questions presented in this case are the actual 

questions listed in the petition. So unless this Court 

has an objection, I'm going to focus on the (d)(2) 

question and how it interplays with (e)(1). And I would 

like to start with Justice Ginsburg's point about why 

the Ninth Circuit opinion is wrong. And other than the 

plain language, which was what we've discussed in the 

brief --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I -- I didn't --

MR. MAZE: I --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I just want -- I just 

described the Ninth Circuit decision. I didn't say it

was wrong.

 MR. MAZE: I apologize. You're correct. I 

would say it's wrong.

 (Laughter.)

 MR. MAZE: Because not only does it ignore 

the plain language and, the point you made that it would 

be 90 to 99 percent of the time it would cut it out, the 

problem is is that position misses the bigger picture. 

(E)(1) doesn't only apply when we're looking at (d)(2) 

claims. In fact, (d)(2) claims are a very, very small 

percentage of what the States deal with in habeas work. 

Typically what we're dealing with are (d)(1) claims or 

claims that weren't even adjudicated on the merits in 

the State court. Let's say it was procedurally barred 

in the State court and we're looking at the procedural 

default rule.

 If you're looking at applying the rule that 

Judge Kozinski has forwarded in the Ninth Circuit, they 

would say that (e)(1) is completely eviscerated if there 

is no extrinsic evidence, even if we're looking at a 

(d)(1) claim and even if we're looking at a procedurally 

barred claim. So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, isn't it --

isn't it the case that under (d)(1) or (d)(2) that's a 

threshold determination, and once you get over that

(e)(1) would have work to do in determining whether 

there was a violation of the Constitution or laws in the 

first place?

 MR. MAZE: Yes, (e)(1) is always going to 

have an application. We would say that it has an 

application at the moment the petition is filed. That 

is, every single subsidiary finding of fact is presumed 

to be true. Let's take a (d)(1) example, Terry Williams 

v. Taylor. This Court said that you could overcome the 

(d)(1) bar in Terry Williams because they had applied 

the wrong law, they had applied Lockhart to Strickland's 

prejudice inquiry. So you jumped over the (d)(1) bar.

 At that point you look at the claim de novo. 

But (e)(1) still has application. Its application is --

is every finding of fact that the State court made that 

goes towards the prejudice determination is presumed to 

be correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: That's under --

you've given yourself an easier case because you're 

going -- you're getting over the threshold under (d)(1).

 MR. MAZE: Correct.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: The problem is 

(d)(2) refers to determination of facts --

MR. MAZE: Yes.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- and asks whether

it's unreasonable. (E)(1) talks about facts and has a 

whole different test, and I -- I guess the difficulty 

I've had is -- is reconciling the two. To the extent 

you can articulate their differences, why would you do 

both?

 MR. MAZE: And that is the difficulty. 

Again, (d)(2) is very limited, the times we use it. But 

yes, it is tough because you see both a "clear and 

convincing" and an "objectively unreasonable" standard. 

But the way to fix the problem is not to cut (e)(1) out 

altogether for every type of claim. It's to try to find 

a way to be able to work (e)(1) and the (d)(2) standard 

together.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, what's an example?

 MR. MAZE: Let's take this case --

JUSTICE BREYER: I can't think of any --

give me an example --

MR. MAZE: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: -- where you're trying to 

proceed under (d)(2), and (e)(1) is somehow relevant. 

Couldn't think of one.

 MR. MAZE: Let's take -- let's take this 

case, for example. Let's switch the facts just a little 

bit and let's say that the State court had made four 

findings of fact. The first one is all three counsel

read the Kirkland report.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh.

 MR. MAZE: The second fact is that all three 

counsel talk to each other for 4 days about the Kirkland 

report.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Uh-huh.

 MR. MAZE: The third fact is Carey Dozier, 

lead counsel, made the decision not to seek another 

evaluation; and the fourth fact is is that Carey Dozier, 

lead counsel, decided not to present the Kirkland report 

or similar evidence to the jury. Those are your four 

facts that are presumed correct under (e)(1).

 JUSTICE BREYER: No. You just look at them, 

and you look under (d)(2), and you say this is an 

unreasonable determination of fact, period. There's no 

reason to go into (e)(1). I mean, if it is an 

unreasonable determination of fact, he wins.

 MR. MAZE: The reason --

JUSTICE BREYER: And if it isn't, you win.

 MR. MAZE: The reason that you go under 

(e)(1) is because Congress has said that you have to.

 JUSTICE BREYER: It didn't say that. What 

it says in (e)(1) is (e)(1) is talking about in a 

proceeding instituted by an application by a person in 

custody, the factual issue is presumed correct. But if

you fail to develop -- - you know, in a proceeding, it's 

presumed correct.

 You're right it doesn't say it literally. 

But I can't figure out an application for it unless 

they're talking about where there is a new hearing. 

Otherwise there is just no need for it, it is just 

repetitive and it gets people mixed up, and (d)(2) does 

all the work.

 MR. MAZE: Again, the problem is, is because 

we're looking at an (e)(1)-(d)(2) situation, but that's 

not the only situation.

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well, let me give you an 

example involving exactly those two provisions and facts 

very similar to the facts here. The State court finds 

that a strategic decision was made, and that raises a 

question under (d)(2): Was the State court's rejection 

of the Strickland claim the result of a decision that 

was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts 

in light of the evidence presented in the State court 

proceeding?

 There are also a host of subsidiary findings 

of historical fact because the attorneys testify and 

documents are produced, and there are conflicts in the 

testimony. And so there's a question of did -- did 

Dozier and Ralph talk about this on a particular day?

Did Trotter write a letter to so-and-so? And so forth. 

So you've got all these subsidiary -- all these findings 

of historical fact, and they are to be reviewed under 

(e)(1), under the plain language of (e)(1).

 MR. MAZE: Right.

 JUSTICE ALITO: And then after they're 

reviewed under the plain language of (e)(1), you turn to 

the question under (d)(2), which is whether the decision 

about whether there was a strategic decision was based 

on -- based on an unreasonable determination of facts.

 MR. MAZE: Correct. And Justice --

JUSTICE ALITO: So there's no conflict.

 MR. MAZE: No. And Justice Alito, if -- the 

way you said it is exactly where I was going with my 

hypothetical. But --

JUSTICE BREYER: I see that, I see that.

 MR. MAZE: The fourth --

JUSTICE BREYER: That's a possible way to 

look at it.

 MR. MAZE: Yes.

 JUSTICE BREYER: And the problem I see with 

that -- now I see why it's controverted, but the problem 

with these standards of review, it just -- it mixes 

people up, and it sounds as if you're bringing in a

looks a little tougher than the saw, and -- but why get 

into all this business?

 MR. MAZE: Because I would come back with 

the saying that this is almost like having, because 

(d)(2) is so limited in what we do, you have a toe ache 

but you're asking us to cut the leg completely off. I 

mean, there's a much broader use of (e)(1) --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: I don't understand that. 

I thought that your -- your position in this case or at 

least one of your positions is there was no unreasonable 

determination of fact. Period.

 MR. MAZE: Correct.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: If you're right about 

that then you win, and there's no reason in the world to 

go on to (e)(1), that this case in your view should be 

totally governed by (d)(2), that is, the determinations 

of fact were reasonable. End of case.

 MR. MAZE: That is not the position we took. 

That position is what the Court ended up doing in Rice 

v. Collins, saying that even if we don't answer the 

question, the State wins. And you could do the same 

thing here, too, that the strategic decision, finding of 

fact is not unreasonable. But we're trying to help the 

Court find a way to make (e)(1) and (d)(2) work 

together.

JUSTICE BREYER: Well, we have one here, and 

my real objection, I guess -- and it's interesting, I 

now see the conflict, with Justice Alito's clear 

explanation of it. And I -- I suppose the -- the thing 

I would ask you then is, look, my objection to it, 

hypothetically, is it's too complicated. Lawyers have 

enough trouble trying to figure this out.

 MR. MAZE: I agree.

 JUSTICE BREYER: Is there any reason we need 

to interpret it that way? The language doesn't have to 

be. Why not have just a simple, clear thing? If -- if 

they're unreasonable, the State loses, and if they're 

not unreasonable, the State wins. Da-da. That's too 

simple. But why not use it?

 MR. MAZE: If the Court would come back and 

say that (e)(1) applies when the petition is filed and 

that if you're outside the (d)(2) claim -- (e)(1) is not 

tethered to the introduction of extrinsic evidence, it 

simply applies.

 But then you came back and said in the 

limited circumstances in which we have a (d)(2) claim --

not a (d)(1) or a procedurally barred claim, but a 

(d)(2) claim -- if the Court came back and said we're 

going to treat objectionably unreasonable as the 

equivalent of clear and convincing evidence -- that

means if you can prove that something is objectively 

unreasonable, it also proves by clear and convincing 

evidence it's wrong -- then that would not be a problem.

 But again, what we're saying to the Court 

is, is if you say that, you need to also say that (e)(1) 

is still not tethered to extrinsic evidence --

evidentiary hearings, because (e)(1) applies in a much 

broader scope that just the (d)(2) question.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Counsel, you don't 

really want us to say that, because unreasonable, as 

we've defined it in (d)(1), means it could be wrong, but 

still not unreasonable.

 MR. MAZE: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So if we say that proof 

of a -- by clear and convincing evidence that a decision 

by the State court was incorrect, you can't equate --

you don't really want us equating that with (d)(2), do 

you?

 MR. MAZE: No. Let me -- let me be clear. 

I was asking Justice Breyer's question about how he 

could write it. I agree that our --

why he starting --

he's saying is, what your adversary responded to Justice 

Ginsburg, unreasonable really is much broader than clear 

and convincing --

MR. MAZE: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- evidence on 

correctness. You don't need it because whether the 

decision is right or wrong is not the issue. Even if 

it's wrong, it could still be reasonably wrong.

 MR. MAZE: Yes.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I mean, one could 

quarrel with that proposition, but that's the state of 

the law. So, why do you need (e)(1)? That's -- that's 

Justice Breyer's question, as I understand it.

 MR. MAZE: I agree. And, again, my position 

is just what Justice Alito had said earlier, that's the 

step-by-step way that we would approach it. That is the 

way --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But work it out in 

theory, okay?

was a strategic decision made?

 MR. MAZE: Right.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: There are a bunch of 

subsidiary facts that -- that were made.

 MR. MAZE: Right.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: If you're applying 

(d)(2), the Court would look at all the subsidiary facts 

and decide not whether they were correct or not, but 

whether they were unreasonably incorrect, okay? If they 

weren't unreasonably incorrect? So you don't have to 

get to the correctness question by clear and convincing 

evidence. If they're -- if they're not unreasonably 

incorrect, the four subsidiary facts would then support 

the fifth general question, correct?

 MR. MAZE: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Either we agree it does 

or it doesn't, but -- I -- I -- I don't understand why 

you need (e)(1) because you never need to get to the 

correctness of the finding.

 MR. MAZE: If I could finish the 

hypothetical earlier, I think I can show how (e)(1) and 

(d)(2) can both have effect in the same case.

 Again, we talked about the four facts that 

might lead to the strategic decision. Let's say that 

the State court record proves by clear and convincing

evidence that the three counsel never spoke to each 

other at all about the Kirkland report, and that has 

been proved wrong by clear and convincing evidence, but 

you have the other three subsidiary findings of fact.

 Then you go to (d)(2). You ask is an 

objectionably unreasonable determination of the facts, 

facts plural, which is how (d)(2) works, to say that a 

strategic decision was made? Well, the answer would be, 

no, it's not objectionably unreasonable, because we 

still know it's presumed correct that Mr. Dozier read 

the report and he made the decision. So --

JUSTICE STEVENS: Let me just interrupt 

because I am trying to follow this here. The four facts 

you have described would -- would support a conclusion 

that it was not unreasonable to make a strategic 

decision not to use the report at the guilt phase trial. 

But what if one believes that it would have been 

unreasonable not to pursue the investigation and --

and -- and to find out more facts for the penalty phase 

trial, and the -- the -- the State court said, no, those 

facts have answered the case.

 Would the unreasonable use of the reasonable 

facts violate the statute?

 MR. MAZE: That would be (d)(1). If you --

JUSTICE STEVENS: That's exactly right.

MR. MAZE: Correct.

 JUSTICE STEVENS: Would that violate (d)(1) 

if even -- even if every one of the subsidiary facts was 

correctly filed and the conclusion drawn by the court 

was also correct, that it was a reasonable strategic 

decision at the guilt phase but unreasonable at the 

penalty phase? How did -- what is the answer there?

 MR. MAZE: The answer would than under 2254 

(d)(1) you could overcome the habeas bar for penalty 

phase because you have shown an unreasonable application 

of Strickland to the facts that we have shown to be 

correct. Again, we don't believe that's the question 

presented, but the (d)(2) question is whether a 

strategic decision was factually made. And if I may --

JUSTICE STEVENS: It also has to involve 

what the strategic decision was?

 MR. MAZE: Yes. And -- and in this case, 

the factual finding, the strategic decision was twofold. 

The strategic decision was not to seek a further mental 

health evaluation after reading and conferring about the 

Kirkland report and not to introduce the Kirkland report 

or similar evidence to the penalty phase jury. That's 

the question of historical fact that you're making under 

(d)(2). And that determination of historical fact we 

can show by the record is not objectively unreasonable.

And if I may, I would like to move to 

Justice Ginsburg's questions earlier about what in the 

record or her point about what in the record shows that 

Mr. Dozier was actually thinking about the penalty phase 

when he made the decision. And there are four parts of 

the record that show he specifically had the penalty 

phase in mind when he made the decision.

 The first is what Justice Ginsburg had 

pointed out, is that when he sought the penalty phase 

about the -- the competency report, the Kirkland report, 

on page 150 of the Joint Appendix he testified that one 

reason was the fact he wanted mitigating evidence.

 The second piece of evidence --

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Somebody said it was put 

in his mouth, the question was on cross-examination.

 MR. MAZE: Well, point two was not put in 

his mouth. Point two is page 140 of the Joint Appendix. 

He was specifically asked, do you -- did you call any 

witnesses in mitigation? And his answer was, I don't 

recall. I know that we talked a lot to psychologists 

and so forth.

 The specific question was, do you remember 

talking to any witnesses for mitigation purposes. And 

the first thing that Mr. Dozier remembered was we did 

talk to psychologists for mitigation purposes.

The clearest piece of evidence is page 283 

of the Joint Appendix, and that is quote where Trotter 

is asked about the Kilby -- I mean the Taylor Harden 

report from Dr. Kirkland, and the part we keep quoting 

is the fact he said that Cary Dozier came and told me 

that we didn't need a further evaluation.

 But what we haven't put in the brief and 

brought up until now is the rest of the quote. Again, 

it's on page 283 of the Joint Appendix. And he starts 

off right after the dash saying he, meaning Cary Dozier, 

determined that we didn't need any further evaluators 

and no further recall because in the course of my 

preparation, "my" being Trotter, in course of my 

preparation for the penalty phase I would read things 

about different psychological evaluations and had raised 

that to him. And again he looked at the report and 

thought that that wouldn't be needed.

 So at the moment Cary Dozier made the 

decision and told to it Trotter, it was specifically 

because Trotter had come to him and said, I am getting 

ready for the penalty phase, just as I was told. I have 

been reading things about having mental health 

evaluations.

 On the page before, 282, he has just said 

that, I could see issues, but because I was the young

attorney, I relied on the senior attorneys to resolve 

them.

 So he goes to Cary Dozier and says I have 

read all of these things about mental health evaluations 

for the penalty phase, should we do another one? And 

Cary Dozier, lead counsel of 22 years, criminal 

experience on both sides, says, I have read the Kirkland 

report, we do not need a further evaluation.

 It was the very next month that counsel 

filed a motion to exclude all psychological evidence, 

and the reason was, as Mr. Trotter told the trial court 

in the trial court record on pages 2 -- of 72 and 73, we 

don't want the State to introduce evidence that he is 

prone to violent behavior, prone to violent behavior 

being the quote. And the trial court asked Mr. Trotter 

what evidence do you have that the State will do that? 

He said the report that was done at Taylor Harden, that 

being Dr. Kirkland's report.

 So, here we are six weeks before trial they 

are fighting to exclude evidence that he is prone to 

violent behavior and specifically referring to the 

Kirkland report. Again, because the very month before 

Cary Dozier had told Trotter we will not have another 

evaluation done because I have read the Kirkland report 

and we are not going to do it any further.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Can I stop you just for 

a factual clarification?

 MR. MAZE: Yeah.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Did the defendant's 

prior history with his other girlfriend come into the 

penalty stage of the trial?

 MR. MAZE: No, at the trial it did not. And 

in fact, the State --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So this was a wise 

strategic decision, perhaps, with respect to the penalty 

phase?

 MR. MAZE: Absolutely.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: It did come in at the 

trial -- at the sentencing phase, correct?

 MR. MAZE: Are you talking about in front of 

the judge?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: In front of the jury.

 MR. MAZE: No, the jury never found out 

about it, because Trotter and Dozier fought to keep it 

out. And, in fact, had the Kirkland report been 

admitted or had counsel followed --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: We're not arguing about 

the penalty phase. The issue is if the trial judge at 

sentencing did hear about the prior assaulted behavior 

anyway, what would have been the strategic decision not

to pursue further evaluations because they -- there's no 

likelihood in my mind that similar assaultive behavior 

was ever going to be kept out of the sentencing phase. 

That's true, isn't it? That's one of the strongest 

aggravating factors that you could prove, correct?

 MR. MAZE: Right. I think your point is, is 

that there was no way they were could prevent the jury 

from hearing about the other sort of violent behavior he 

had except for keeping out the mental health.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: The sentencing --

MR. MAZE: Jury. The penalty phase jury --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- jury. Not the 

penalty phase?

 MR. MAZE: Correct.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So that's really -- I 

think that was Justice Stevens' question, which was, 

what was the strategic basis of a decision not to pursue 

mental health information when everything you wanted to 

keep out of the penalty phase would be coming at the 

sentencing phase anyway?

 MR. MAZE: Let me see if I'm understanding 

the question correctly. You're saying that let's assume 

that it was strategic not to allow the jury that gives 

the advisory verdict that can turn into a mitigating 

circumstance the ability to find out about the previous

assault and all of his other prior assaults, but not to 

seek a further evaluation in time for the judge, who 

makes the ultimate sentence, that's your question?

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That's the question.

 MR. MAZE: All right. Under Alabama law, 

you have one trial. You have the expert witnesses 

testify in front of the jury. The time gap between the 

judge hearing it and the jury making their initial 

penalty phase advisory verdict is simply so a 

presentence investigation report can be made.

 In this case, the presentence investigation 

report was made. The two prior psychological 

evaluations were attached to it by our Rule 26.3. 

It's -- let me be honest. It is an open question under 

Alabama law whether you can present new witnesses and 

new evidence in front of the sentencing judge.

 The Alabama courts, in a case called Boyd v. 

State, and I will give you the cite, it's 746 So.2nd 

364, and the pinpoint is 398, had said counsel cannot be 

ineffective for failing to put on new witnesses and new 

experts in front of the sentencing judge because our 

statute doesn't give you the opportunity, doesn't allow 

for it.

 All that the sentencing hearing in front of 

the judge is for is for the judge to allow counsel to

give a final argument after the presentence 

investigation report has come in and counsel has ensured 

that it's correct.

 We have had a Federal district court say 

that, I believe that's unconstitutional, I don't think 

you should be allowed to prevent counsel from presenting 

new evidence in front of the judge, in the way you're 

suggesting; but, again, that's open -- it's an open 

question.

 The point here is, though, that's not the 

claim that was adjudicated in front of the state court, 

and, again, this is AEDPA 2254(d). The only merits 

determination made by the State court and, thus, the 

only thing this court can hold the State court in error 

for, is whether or not there was a strategic decision to 

withhold it from the jury and whether that question is 

prejudicial because what you would have to do --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: That -- that brings us to 

the point of beginning. And could you give me, in 

summary form, your best interpretation of both (d) and 

(e), (d)(1), (d)(2), (e)(1), in light of the deference 

that the Federal courts should pay to State 

determinations?

 It seems to me that, if you use -- if you 

reserve (e)(1) for cases in which there's a hearing in

the District Court, then it's somewhat counterintuitive 

because the strongest standard applies to the accused. 

He has the greatest burden, when the State hearing was 

the least effective.

 On the other hand, if they overlap, there --

then (d)(2) is often superfluous, so I have a choice of 

something that is counterintuitive or superfluous, and I 

don't know which one to take.

 MR. MAZE: I agree. If --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: And -- and -- but maybe 

there is -- is some more general theory that you can 

give me.

 MR. MAZE: There is.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Res judicata doesn't work.

 MR. MAZE: Right.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: Although I think Congress 

might have had something like that in mind.

 MR. MAZE: If I may, let me give you the way 

we see (e)(1) working on a broader scope. And we ran 

into the problem that Mr. Chief Justice had mentioned 

earlier, about how (e)(1) applies to (d)(2).

 Here's how we believe (e)(1) works 

altogether under AEDPA: A petition is filed. At the 

moment that petition is filed, all subsidiary findings 

of fact are presumed correct under (e)(1). The next

question you should answer should be will extrinsic 

evidence come in, either under Rule 7 through 

affidavits, et cetera, under Rule 8 in evidentiary 

hearing.

 If the answer to the question is, yes, we 

will accept extrinsic evidence, then you accept the 

extrinsic evidence, and you have the question this Court 

couldn't answer last year in Bell v. Kelly. How does 

2254(d) work after that?

 Now, let's say that you answer the question, 

no, you will not have extrinsic evidence, which is the 

case you have here, and you move over the 2251(d) bars. 

If they're only arguing (d)(1), you don't have a problem 

because you simply look at the application.

 The problem runs in when you have a (d)(2) 

claim with new extrinsic evidence -- with no extrinsic 

evidence. Excuse me. The way I think that it should 

work and the way it will work all the way down the line, 

no matter how the Court comes to it, is to say that the 

smaller subsidiary findings of fact are presumed correct 

until, in this case, the record evidence shows that 

they're clear and convincingly wrong.

 An example of that would be Miller-El 2. In 

Miller-El 2, you found that the state record evidence 

proved that defining that there was sexual abuse in

the -- in the State court records was proved wrong by 

clear and convincing evidence.

 At that point, you can say, well, it's also 

a (d)(2) violation because it's objectively 

unreasonable.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Can I -- can I suggest --

it doesn't seem to me there's any -- any contradiction 

between the two. (E)(1) addresses a factual finding. 

(D)(2), on the other hand, addresses the decision of the 

Court, which was based on, sometimes, just one factual 

finding, but, sometimes, many.

 So you -- you proceed, first, with (e)(1), 

and you -- you ask whether each factual finding on which 

the decision was based was shown by the defendant, 

either in the record, or if -- if you have an additional 

hearings, by new evidence, to be incorrect by clear and 

convincing evidence. You do that fact-by-fact.

 Having found, let's say, two of the five 

facts. To fail that test, you then go up to (d)(2) and 

say, okay, in light of the fact that two of the facts --

in light of the fact -- since two of the facts that the 

court relied on were false, was the decision vitiated by 

that reason, or was it nonetheless a reasonable 

determination?

(e)(1) applies to facts and (d)(2) applies to the 

decision, it's whether the decision was -- was based on 

an unreasonable determination of the facts.

 MR. MAZE: I think that, in two minutes, 

you've said it better than I did --

JUSTICE BREYER: If that's so, why would we 

not soon have what I call the habeas corpus 

jurisprudence of what is a subsidiary and what is a 

major fact and what is a finding?

 And what's wonderful about that is no habeas 

corpus proceeding will ever end because, throughout the 

country, people will make mistakes about what is the --

what is the subsidiary and the subsidiary to the 

subsidiary, and then what is the more general, and 

pretty soon, we'll have all -- everybody will be arguing 

about that, and there will only be four professors in 

the country who understand which is which, and they will 

each say different things.

 MR. MAZE: I -- I would disagree. I think 

the district courts can handle that question. I 

don't -- I don't -- I mean, they've been handling it 

since AEDPA came out in '96.

 I see that my time is almost through. I 

want to make --

they've been handling it. I think there's a tremendous 

confusion, and I -- I find it very difficult to write an 

opinion to give them guidance as to when they can set 

aside hearings, to what extent they have to review the 

entire record.

 To me, I think many courts of appeals and 

district of -- and district courts think that it's just 

like a clearly erroneous standard. It's very hard to --

to use these standards to give you any concrete guidance 

in this specific case.

 MR. MAZE: I agree. It's difficult, but 

again, that's why we're saying just use the plain 

language. Look at the smaller subsidiary findings of 

fact, to see whether or not you can rebut the 

presumption, and, as Justice Scalia said, you look at 

the overall decision and see if it was based on a 

determination of facts, a larger bundle of facts, to see 

whether or not it was unreasonable.

 Again, my time is about to run out. I want 

to make one final point. Mr. Scanlon has said that 

prejudice also has a 2254(d) bar in it in this case, and 

we agree with that because there was a merits 

adjudication on prejudice.

 I would simply might like to make the point, 

regardless of how the Court comes out on the (d)(2)

question on deficient performance, it cannot overcome 

the 2250(d) bar for prejudice here because, again, 

simply knowing that someone had the low IQ and had a low 

grammar school kind of education level, we are in the 

unique position where the sentencer actually knew that.

 So we have a very large insight into what 

the sentencer would have done. There's no -- it's not 

objectively unreasonable to believe the sentencer would 

have done, again, what he had done the first time had he 

heard similar facts.

 So, if the Court has no further questions, I 

will cede my time to the Court.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, General.

 MR. MAZE: Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Scanlon, you 

have three minutes remaining, but I'll give you more, 

since I would like to start with a question. My first 

question was whether your petition was under (d)(2), and 

during the argument, I went back and looked at the 

petition.

 And I see the exact language of (d)(1) 

quoted in paragraphs 45, 52, 58, 63, 71, 76, 82, 90, 94, 

97, and 104, (d)(1), and, unless I'm missing it, nowhere 

do I see the language of (d)(2). I see the language of 

(d)(2) in your cert petition questions.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KERRY A. SCANLON

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. SCANLON: Well, it was brought -- with 

all due respect, Mr. Chief Justice, under (d)(2), as 

well, because the central focus was the factual 

allegation, the factual findings made by the State 

court. That's what the petition was based on, and

You did it -- I think it's more than a dozen times. You 

never quoted the language of (d)(2).

 Now, going back, you can say, well, we talk 

about these facts or those facts, but that is also 

relevant to the application question under (d)(1).

 MR. SCANLON: But there were -- there was 

language about unreasonable application -- unreasonable 

determination of the fact. That was always part of the 

petition. That's what was focused on.

quote (d)(2). It would seem to me that the focus was on 

(d)(1).

 MR. SCANLON: Well, I think the focus was on 

both. And these cases, they're inextricably linked 

together as well, because these determinations of 

whether something is strategic is not only a factual 

determination, but it's a determination that has legal 

principles under Strickland and Wiggins and Williams.

 But another thing I would like to say, in 

answer to Justice Kennedy's question, is (d)(2) should 

never be made superfluous in this, because that is the 

primary provision in this statute. It calls for looking 

at the entire State record. It's a very strong 

deference standard. (E)(1) has its application, but it 

would be incredibly complicated for this Court to tell 

lower courts to apply (e)(1) on top of (e)(2).

 And Justice Alito, in your example, the 

problem in this case was that they looked at subsidiary 

facts; half of them were immaterial to the claim 

completely. And then the State court jumped from the 

fact that those were not rebutted by clear and 

convincing evidence to deciding immediately that 

everything was therefore reasonable.

 And that's why the courts have had a hard 

time with this standard, is AEDPA is hard enough to

understand as it is, but if they are asked to put in a 

correctness standard on top of a reasonableness 

standard, and then you've got the difficulty of defining 

what's a subsidiary finding, and Justice Scalia, the 

points you made, it's actually very difficult, because 

(e)(1) focuses on the determination of a factual issue. 

(D)(2) focuses on the determination of the facts. It's 

not a decision in (d)(2); it's the determination of the 

facts.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: No, no, no. It resulted in 

a decision that was based on an unreasonable 

determination of facts.

 MR. SCANLON: Right, and what the Court --

JUSTICE SCALIA: It focuses on the decision, 

whether the decision could have been reached --

MR. SCANLON: Right.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: -- without the use of any 

facts that had been found to be false.

 MR. SCANLON: Right, but in every (d)(2) 

case this Court has considered from the lower courts, 

what they focus on is whether it's an unreasonable 

determination, as opposed to focusing on the word 

"decision." And I think --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Do you think there's 

a difference between a (d)(1) case and a (d)(2) case?

MR. SCANLON: Yes, there is. But in this 

case, I want to make it clear that whatever the standard 

the Court adopts in this case, the Petitioner has 

clearly made its case, because there was evidence. They 

never did any investigation when they had this strong 

lead. And Strickland and Wiggins, if they mean 

anything, means that you have to make an informed 

decision after an investigation. And in this case there 

was no investigation.

 They now concede that, and there was no 

reasonable decision made that the investigation should 

be limited. And the Eleventh Circuit got that right. 

They simply found the wrong facts.

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, Counsel. 

The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the 

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
